50,Perfect for ice age lovers.,"Great quality of services and comfortable stay. Everything there was magnificent. Kindness above all and a great smile to assist you. Without going any further, one of the best places I've been.Museum on the lagoons and puddle of natural pitch. Thanks to this you can see an incredible amount of fossilized bones and in very good conservation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lilianasmith
30,Short visit,"Worth a little walk around. It was very close to our Wilshire hotel. Interesting fact sheet. Also, a few minutes walk to Petersen Automotive Museum",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/litmanen16
40,Interesting place to visit,"I didn’t even know this place existed, interesting to visit, with so many interesting to watch and experience a different kind of museum, so relaxing to go and walk, and see all this tar coming out of the ground, great field trip place to take kids and teenagers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mfloresgc
40,La Brea Tar Pits...very educational,"It’s a little confusing after you pay to park, to know where to go. There’s no one directing you so you kind of just start walking. My advice would be to start with the museum. You can’t miss it because it’s in the middle of a grass hill next to the parking lot. After about an hour in there you venture out to the different pits to see the tar bubbling and some of the excavation sites.Lastly, if you want a better photo back ground. after you go through the museum go to what looks like the front gate. From the parking lot it’s about 200yards. So you basically enter the area and park your car on the backside of the pits and walk around the sidewalk to the front of the museum. (Parking I believe was $15) Then, directly in front of the museum there is a “front entrance” to the pits, for folks walking down the street I guess.The Pits offer a great learning experience and very interesting. Total visit time, 2-3hours depending on how fast you read or how much you want to remember.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kevsadventures
30,See it once,I came back 50 years after seeing it for the first time. My memories are more impressive than the current state. Maybe they were more active. But it is a good idea to see how mankind discovered oil - seepage to the surface like this famous spot. I didn't go into the museum.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cgny1fwd
40,Fascinating! Amazing to see this in the middle of LA. Lot's of interesting creatures to see!,"The children in our family (and the adults) really liked the Tar Pits! It's an amazing history lesson on what use to live on earth thousands of years ago. They have over 3.5 million fossils collected and are still doing daily excavations. The research facility was in full swing the day we visited. Very fascinating to see them all working in the lab sorting over so many pieces recovered from the pits to be cataloged and documented. So many different animals they have on exhibit, you will find it all very interesting. Our children enjoyed it so much that they want to go back again in the future.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/916vinnyc
40,Very interesting visit,"The tar pits themselves are not much to look at, but the museum is fantastic. It is just amazing how many bones they have retrieved from these pits, and the ongoing analysis will take years. It is a great place to go for kids and adults alike",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CLZA
50,Tar Pits right in the heart of LA,Great place to learn some history. Active Tar pits still being excavated. Great museum with lots of history. Also many volunteers you can watch cleaning fossils.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carollt781
50,Come here to learn a little about LA's history thousands of years ago,"I found this museum to be so fascinating. You can see the tar (asphalt) bubbling up around the grounds - which are free to walk around. You do have to pay to go into the museum, but the outside is also very interesting - did you know to date, they have found 5 million fossils in the tar pits?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/763MelissaP
40,A must see but very small landmark,"La Brea Tar Pits is a must see for anyone who it ticking off boxes of iconic LA sites. The fenced in sites where either active tar, excavation or water are free to view. To view the museum and the actual fossils you have to go inside and pay. The museum if you take a very leisurely walk will take you about an hour and a half. The fossils are large and that takes up a lot of space. Its amazing to see but there isn't a ton to see. Go on a whim or plan it as an activity but its not a whole day affair.There is parking in the lot until 10 pm but it will cost you $15. You may be able to find metered parking on the street nearby.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marybO6789RN
40,Bubbling Tar and Bones of Unfortunate Animals Who Became Mired In It,"This museum and historic site is very interesting and educational with many displays of fossilized skeletons that were discovered on the surrounding grounds. The building is laid out with exhibits around a central open courtyard that is landscaped like a tropical rainforest, complete with stream and waterfall. Windows let you look into a working lab and watch scientists processing fossils. Several of the attractions are outside, including the famous bubbling tar pits and some excavation sites with interpretive signage. A 3D movie and a puppet show (weekends only) are available for an additional charge. Another reviewer thought the outside exhibits were free, but when we visited there were kiosks set up at the entrances to Hancock Park where the tar pits and excavation sites are located and attendants were collecting admission. The museum building contains a large shop with t-shirts, books and souvenirs. We spent about 90 minutes at the museum and skipped the movie and theater show because they seemed more oriented toward children. Tickets are a few dollars cheaper if you buy in advance online. We visited on Memorial Day when we knew many downtown businesses would be closed and there was less traffic. We arrived early and entered when the museum first opened. It wasn't very crowded for the first 30-60 minutes but it definitely got busy before we left (the garden courtyard was a quiet haven). Wheelchair access to the museum and grounds was very good. The Tar Pits charges $15 for parking. Metered on-street parking is available but you have to be careful about the day/time restrictions so you don't get towed. Public transit buses stop nearby on Wilshire Blvd. There are places to eat within walking distance but not in the museum. We made a day of it and also visited the Petersen Museum which is just a block away. The Los Angeles County Museum of Art is right across the park too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CrankingChick
40,Enjoyable experience,"Family visit! Interesting and very visual experience. Educational and good for inquisitive children. The museum itself is small and is all based on a single level. It is interactive and fun for kids. There is a small garden area in the middle (no play area but a nice garden for exploring). Overall, we enjoyed the visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sharonwa
40,Enjoyed museum,The kids enjoyed the museum. The tar pits were interesting. The walk outside was nice to see how they excavate the pits.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sruthp
30,"Interesting, but I recommend skipping admission and just viewing the free parts","The tar pits are kind of fascinating. Who knew that tar pits could be found in the heart of LA? BUT I don't really think it's worth it to pay for the museum. Insider scoop: the best part of the visit to the La Brea Tar Pits & Museum is OUTSIDE: several active tar pits and signs explaining exactly what the tar pits are, their significance (fossils), and the history of the site. You can see ALL of this without paying admission. The only things that require admission (they give you green bracelets to wear to show you paid) are the museum and one covered pit (which did have bubbles of tar that I could NOT stop watching). Everything else can be viewed for free. Admission to museum is $15/adult, which I felt was really steep for this small museum and one covered tar pit. The museum has a lot of fossils and replicas of fossils. It also has a movie theater that plays movies like ""Ice Age Encounters,"" but you'll pay more if you want to see one of those. Unless you or your kid is REALLY into the tar pits, I say see the outside area for free. You'll learn about the tar pits without having to pay $15 per adult. Interesting, but do it the free way!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alexisrachelletx
30,Parking is the pits,"La Brea Tar Pits is a place everyone should visit and added to the bucket list. The place reeks of sulfur, but its all about prehistoric animals trapped in tar. Very educational experience for you or your children. There are not too many things to do, but plenty of reading. Its possible that you won't be spending all day there. I suggest having additional plans, unless your idea of a good time is to see the same things more than once. They have a small shop, and places to eat are just a walk away, which makes for a good experience. Be warned that the parking there was horrible, the parking stalls are not marked, very compact, your parking skills will be put to the test, good luck.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TexasNative71
50,Surprisingly excellence park and museum,"The grounds are informative and make a wonderful park. The museum is fascinating, reasonably priced and manageable. The building of the museum is art in itself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barkus1968
50,It is not a sticky situation,I loved the Tar Pits. It was a completely unexpected delight. First they let me in FREE because I am a librarian. Museums should always let librarians and teachers in for free. :),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sherryscheline
50,A surprisingly interesting part of LA,"Our tour guide, Jasmine from La La Tours took us here and the geological and archaeological aspects were truly fascinating. While we were only here for about 30 minutes, we are glad we came here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mrbasman74
40,Great little museum,A great place to take your kids. Including the video — don’t miss it — very educational — it’ll take about 2 hours to see the museum and the grounds. More if you want to watch the volunteers laboriously sorting and cleaning the shards and micro fossils they dug out of the pits.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Watsson
50,Unique And Fascinating,"The open pits exterior to the museum are underwhelming, because nature is not a movie. No bubbling tar pools, just small patches of visible tar amidst thin crusts of soil. That innocuous appearance is what led tens of thousands of animals, from the tiny to the huge to their gruesome dooms over a period of millions of years. The museum however expresses the totality of the pits, with great hands on experiences for kids. It's a wonderful introduction to the world of the Mastodon and the sabertooth tiger and the human history of the discovery and excavations of the pits is fascinating as well. Fun for all ages, even though at heart it's a story of unremitting tragedy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/88AVANTI
50,better than excepted,We had a great time at the museum. There were lots of volunteers entertained us and educated us as well..,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tammyprince
30,"Cool museum, Boring Tar Pits...","We found this place a bit boring. The small museum onsite has some pretty cool exhibits including some bears and tigers and dinosaurs, and even a lab that shows how they process fossils. That was the best part. The tar pits themselves are just pools of mud and tar surrounded by fences, some with fake, plastic mammoths and animals in them. There are several tar pits and background info for each one explains what they found and such, but again, not much to look at. We regretted paying to come here, but if you are really interested in history, geology, and science in general, maybe you will find it more interesting than we did...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Avenjur
50,Fascinating!,"Even if you aren't into bones and such...this is a one of a kind ""attraction."" The history behind the tar pits is unbelievable. There is lots of information as you walk around the park. Be sure to read it so you can better understand how unique this site is. The pits are free to walk around. The museum does charge admission.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lcb5310
50,Definite visit in Los Angeles,"If you are in LA, you should go here. Very interesting, actually fascinating. Plan to spend 2- 3 hours with going into the museum. This was definitely worth visiting. Perfectly preserved ancient history is here. Great for families. Great for everyone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevebC3900EZ
50,Amazing place,"What a wonderful museum. We were a party of 5, 4 adults and one teenager and we Spent several hours wandering in awe of what was on display. Well worth a visit even without children, but they have lots of interactive displays for children. So much archeological history it was simply amazing. Put it on your list it is a must see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tekohiwi
40,Short but educating,"This museum wasn't even planned on my trip however I don't regret it. It's a small museum but with a lot of information. I'm a visual learner and I just loved how they have simulations of an animal from that time period. I truly wish it was larger. Nonetheless, I recommend people to go it's easily accesible and it is entertaining",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mikear24
50,Interesting Place in the City,"Seeing the replicas of animals was very interesting, and the history of finding bones was awesome. Cool Place. This visit was in 2012 not 2019.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rojo44
50,"Visiting La Brea Tar Pits, Los Angeles","The La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles were very interesting. Anyone interested in paleontology and archaeology would find this area fascinating. There were about 90 tar pits of various sizes in which pre-historic woolly mammoths and saber-toothed tigers would go in search of food and become stuck in one of the tar pits. The more they struggled, the deeper they would sink. The museum has many fossils of various sizes to view as well as watching paleontologists dig and clean the fossils for classification. Overall it was an awesome experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Q7936LQbillr
20,A bit boring,Best to just look through the fence and see the Tar Pits versus paying for the glory of viewing. Not my thing I guess.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robin136
50,Was Very Surprised By This!,"This was a place suggested by my husband, who was in Los Angeles the first time. I never heard of it until this visit, whereas I have been to LA at least 10 times. The attraction is a must visit place for everyone who like to see something unique; can you imagine LA when it was still largely inhabited by ancient animals, most of which are extinct? They were just rediscovered because so many of them were captured by the tar pits in this part of LA. The place has been turned into a museum, and you can even still see a live tar pit up to now when you get to visit the place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jer0meespin0sab
50,A nice surprise,"This was not on our visit list, but we're glad we went. The tour was good and provided a lot of interesting background n a piece of LA history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrandMrsT24
40,Educational Way to Spend a Few Hours,This center built around the active tar pits is very informative and great for families with school aged kids. Plenty of fossils and Wooly Mammoths. It is so surprising to see it located right in the middle of the city. Not expensive and worth the visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/346billf
50,Perfect rainy day or any other day activity,"I would definitely recommend checking this out if you have the chance. We (ages 7, 9, 36 and 44) really enjoyed the experience. It’s amazing just how many fossils they’ve already found and it was really cool to see the actual work being done. This would be a great rainy day activity because the actual tar pits are the only outside part. We also saw the movie. If you want to extend the experience I would suggest it but if you’re crunched for time I would skip that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Maegan2450
30,The tar pit...ok check,"""That's it"" was the commentary from a member of our group. Yes it is cool. Yes it is in the middle of the city. The air smells of tar but the picture of what you see here...is exactly what you are going to see. Although you cannot see it from your car...it is a 'drive by' unless you are going into the museum. I asked a woman with her child if the museum was worth it and she said ""for a 6 year old...yes"". Enjoyed our brief visit, took pictures and left. Took longer to purchase our coffee at Starbucks nearby!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Brian07663NJ
50,Fantastic view into natural history,"Went to La Brea Tar Pits with the family while on vacation, and we all really enjoyed spending a long time in the museum and in the surrounding area, learning about animals, natural history, changes and preservation. Great experience!The original tar pits have preserved a large number of animals and are a great source for understanding of evolution, environmental changes and more. The La Brea Tar Pits museum and surrounding area provide a fantastic insight into the animals and what we can learn from this. The inside exhibits are of interest for young kids, teenagers and adults. The surrounding area gives really interesting insight into the real tar pits, quite close up. This is then all linked nicely together with the very successful design of the museum building.Very much worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EagleFlyer
40,Great History of LA,The museum is worth a few hours of wandering and learning about the history of the tar pits and of the local area that used to be a rancho through a land grant. There are a few interactive exhibits that kids and adults enjoyed and the volunteers were amazing! I love how they were stationed around the place to show bones and give interesting facts about the animals that have been pulled out of the pits. I also enjoyed watching them clean bones that have been found. We spent about 2 hours here before walking over to the Farmers Market for lunch.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/irsh21
50,Excellent!,Highly recommended for a visit! Lots of space to walk around and wonderful exhibits. Watching the scientists at work was the best part!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DawnSB
50,Amazing learning experience!,Must go see this place! All kids and adults enjoyed learning and seeing the pits and walking around. Great space to walk around for kids as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DawnSB
40,Historic area,"We enjoyed getting to tour the museum, seeing the history of the mammoth animals that once roamed near Wilshire Blvd., viewing the skeletons of giant bears, sloths, mammoths, etc. was very interesting. Seeing the enclosed active tar pits, made us realize they could still trap unsuspecting victims yet today.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rokkr2020
50,Interesting!,"We were told that this spot was used for filming ""Volcano"". The muddy water keeps bubbling all the time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ruditea
30,loved the grounds did not visit museum,"I have always wanted to see the tar pits, much different then expected, not in a bad way. The grounds around the museum has lots of interesting things to see and it's a good space to let your kids run around if you are doing a day of museums. I did not go inside.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeesaD27
50,interesting and fun,"Where weather is always beautiful, go to the tar pits and walk around. Great for kids and adults.

50,A scientific opportunity not to miss,"I would highly recommend anyone visiting Los Angeles to include a visit to the La Brea tar pits and Museum. The entire place is fascinating and the museum is filled with amazing stories, information, and displays of educational value. It’s very marvelous that all of this is located so centrally in one of the biggest cities of the world!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanW440
40,Alright,"The museum is interesting and the people working there are great. I was a bit let down by the actual ""pits"" outdoors but then again I'm not exactly sure what I was expecting... Worth a visit anyway.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TPAT75
50,Interesting and good value,"This was a very interesting and well laid out place. The entry fee was very reasonable and the tours excellent. Everything within easy reach from the excellent museum / display part, through to the outdoor end which even includes an active archeological dig. One of the highlights of our California trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jackiel21
30,Okay way to spend a few hours .,"I know this sounds odd, but I guess going on the weekend leads to a lack of things going on. You would think the place would be busiest on the weekend, but the only thing they had going on while we were there was a Q&A with the people in the labs at the museum. We parked behind the park, and it was all day parking which was good, we had to go down a flight of steps and were on top of the museum, which seemed like an odd setup, and nothing was in the area at all. We walked down to the museum area and got tickets, its one big circle with an outside garden in the middle. The Museum was small, with various examples of what would be roaming around and getting caught in the tar pits. If you go on the weekend there is no one in the par at all, When we went the pit that is shown in the picture here on trip advisor had no one in it, and nothing is done, a bunch of trash was in the pit from people dropping things in it. The park area itself is expansive, but once you've seen the big pit closest to the museum and the one where they were working, the rest didn't seem to be too stimulating. I want to point out I love fossils and very into paleontology and was very excited to go. It was lackluster and sort of in the middle of town, so it takes a long time to get there through heavy traffic. I agree when people say if you are there for a short amount of time, not to go unless it's nearby something else you want to do or see. When we went we were going on a Hollywood tour in the early evening, so we weren't too far away from that. It was a lot less time to look around than I thought it would be. It may be better to go on a weekday than a weekend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kyla1098
40,Interesting,"Brief visit to view the La Brea tar Pits and Museum on our morning tour of Los Angeles, and to be honest that;s all most of us needed, i personally would have liked to venture around the museum but the only from the fence was it, interesting and will be back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TeamWard
40,Enjoyed the tar pits,A 2.5 - 3 hour activity. Enjoyed the speakers at the outdoor pit project 23 the most. The short animated film about what happens to animals that live on islands was also interesting-3 minutes,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/775vickip
40,Interesting tar pits,The tar pits were interesting to see and there are informative displays explaining what has been going on there. It is set in a nice park to walk around in.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robertmL1495PA
50,Fossls In TAR,So much more exciting and interesting then we thought!! Millions of fossils found in LA!!! A NOT MISS attraction for every age.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pegmanochi425
30,Interesting concept but not one of the highlights of LA,"This place is unique considering the fact that you cannot see animal fossils trapped in actual tar pits everywhere. However if you have limited time in this city, I would suggest reserving that time for other things because after seeing one tar pit, which takes 5min you are done. The museum only has fossils but then again they are not that interesting. In sum, I would suggest you to skip this if you are not a big fan of fossils.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlaraAygen
50,Well worth the admission,We were just going to look at the park but were very pleased we went into the museum as we wouldn't have appreciated the site at all without going inside.It is well laid out with very well illustrated history and uses up-to-date museum technology. Loved watching the volunteers at work in the lab.We watched the 3D film which costs $5 each extra but sets the scene and is a timely reminder about global warming. We also went on an outside walk around with an archaeologist which was also informative but a bit bumpy in a wheelchair. Wheelchairs are available to loan.There is no cafe here but the helpful staff will give you a list and map of nearby restaurants.All in all a fascinating place among the skyscrapers.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/flowerlady64
50,"History, geology & drama!","This place is fantastic if you are interested in history or geology, and it's easily accessible by car or Uber if you are visiting LA. I watched the film first which told the dramatic story of how/why the tar pits and fossils are there. For me, seeing the film first helped understand all the exhibits better. Observing the people working on the fossils and viewing the pits themselves totally enhanced the experience. Be prepared - I visited on a weekday and several school groups were there as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jlindq
20,Not worth paying for,"You can walk around the tar pits and surrounding park without paying. Really not worth paying $15 for the musuem, not much to see or do inside.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Boi80

The outdoors exhibits were great to walk around on a beautiful day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TracyC4242
30,Best for Children NOT adults,"If you have small children, especially in a dinosaur age period, this is a great place to visit. The look of aware and wonder in some of the kids eyes made my visit worth it. But for an adult, there's not that much to see here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/64nje
50,Really good alternative,"Had a really nice couple of hours with the family here. It quite interesting when you get into it and bizarre that this has been bubbling away for millions of years and the fact it does still causes problems for building in the area even today.There is plenty of space for little ones to run around. Didn’t have any issues with our under 2 y/o here, baring in mind it is essentially a museum we were pleased.If you pre-book and go on a Tuesday you can get free entry. Definitely worth considering if your plans work. Also helpful to note there is a really handy carpark there but they charge $15 for the day.We looked at every aspect got involved talking to staff and asking questions and also ran around outside (well the kids did) and it took about 1 1/2hrs I’d say.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andym954

50,One of a kind marvel,"These were tremendous discoveries in the heart of the city and are displayed to perfection in this fascinating museum.Setting the scene with simulated sinking of mastodons in the grounds, the captivating accounts continue inside.A cogent timeline is shown and explained, from the first semblance of multitudes of bones underground to the scientific work continuing today. The latter is to be seen in the laboratory that is on view.Impressive skeletons and models show the variety of large and huge ice-age animals that are now extinct. Included are mastodons, bears and daunting looking scimitar-toothed felines.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/permia
30,Disappointing,We expected a much larger collection of tar pits with actual remains of prehistoric animal life. There was very little to see and the only brochures and maps available were in Mandarin Chinese,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ambassador779473
50,Fascinating Ice Age Fossils in the Midde of LA,My 10 year old daughter and I visited the museum and we really enjoyed it. Fascinating to learn how the tar pits came to be such a rich trove of fossils over time. Really cool to watch the workers carefully clean and catalog the fossils. Watch the 3d movie that was a learning experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Durbanguy
50,La brea,This was definitely worth the time to see a very unique and interesting place. Videos were informative and the outside portion was enjoyable as well. We combined it with a trip to the Peterson auto museum a few blocks away. A short inexpensive Uber ride from downtown,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/orangebowl2014
50,A unique and interesting experience,"It was wonderful experience viewing all the pits with the sticky asphalt and bubbling gas from underground oil depisits.You can watch them escavate fossils at pit 91.The museum has wonderful displays of Dire wolves, Mammoths, Saber tooth cats and much more. You can also watch the scientists clean and study the fossils in the lab. Watch a film in the theater and view some of the 5 million fossils found and stored on the site.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deanalang
40,Adults will find it very interesting,"We brought our 8 year old grandson and he wasn't impressed. The adults found the info very fun. Lots to see and read about in terms of the history involved, the tar pits outside are facinating to see and envision what the creatures found here might have encountered 1000's of years ago! To watch them actually cleaning fossils and bones found here was really cool. The museum is not huge. Some examples of bones and full-sized animal skeletons, just enough to again be cool for the adults and even the younger human too. There was a movie/video that was available for an additional fee, and even though we had heard it was worth seeing, our young friend did not have the patience by that point to attempt it. Interesting that this place is nestled right in the middle of such an urban metropolis area. Just bear in mind who is going into this attraction with you, but be prepared to get a great history lesson! Very worth checking out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rschmitt73
50,"Alaskans in LA for 24 hours - loved La Brea from the blurping tar ponds to the family friendly sculptures, exhibits!",Wonderful. We loved the Dire wolves and all other creatures. So many species. Another world. Also saw fossil cleaners and preparers at work. Pit 91 is the active pit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hexagramrex
50,Educational and Entertaining,"I didn’t know what to expect from La Brea Tar Pits, aside from the famous mammoth statues. I must say, it is easily one of the most fascinating museums I have ever visited. The indoor portion itself isn’t too large, although there is an interesting collection of artifacts to see...I’d plan to spend around 45 minutes to an hour looking around inside. The active pits outside are especially compelling! It is so neat to watch real-life excavation. I could have spent hours watching the progress.There are several tours, shows, and talks included with your ticket. I would definitely take the time to do some of these. We went on the Project 23 Revealed tour, which helped me better understand the purpose and context of the museum/pits. I left feeling more informed about anthropology, the Ice Age, and Southern California.Entertainment and education quality aside, each of the staff members I interacted with was very kind and knowledgeable, and the museum grounds are beautiful. It was a wonderful way to spend a morning. I highly recommend visiting La Brea Tar Pits!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A4483GQmaryc
50,Super interesting!!,We were able to visit the tar pits whilst at the auto museum nearby. Really lovely area. Tar pits are super interest. We walked around the pits as this is free. We did go to the museum as the information and pits is good enough.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lorna12390
50,Grandmother,We had a real enjoyable time at the la bra tar pits. I went with small children and we decided not to go into the museum.We stayed outside and enjoyed the park.we so enjoyed the grounds and rolled down the hills. We felt safe and the children also enjoyed the art display that we walked through.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/393linneaw
50,Tar Pits,"Weird place, a must-see kind of thing. I don't think I know of such a place anywhere else, there has to be somewhere, but not as accessible as this, the middle of LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LesW305
50,"Oh Wow, This Place is Super Cool","Didn't know what to expect in the middle of the city, but the tar pits are amazing part of Los Angeles history. Some of the pit's are large, some are small. The museum is amazing and clean, as was the entire grounds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/5thman
40,Unique,La Brea Tar Pits and Museum was worth a visit if your interested in archaeology and history. Very well set up and interesting.This site is next to the Los Angeles County Art Museum. And walking distance to the Original Farmers market where you can get a really good feed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lorriskinner
50,"Really fun place, but I felt very small next to some of the re-creations","I am glad we made time for this museum. It is pricey to park ($15), but we lucked out and were there on a Tuesday, which has free admission. I had heard of this place before we visited, but had no idea it was in the middle of the city. Parking is plentiful, but it's a long walk to the front entrance. The displays are eye-catching and photos of me standing next to a mammoth make me feel very small. There are lots of displays with explanations attached to them. We also watched a movie narrated by Christopher Plummer about the history of the area, which was enlightening,. The only downside was the cost of the photos seemed very high ... a refrigerator magnet cost $15 and the whole package was $50. We spent a couple of hours here and really liked it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lburke19
40,Really interesting place,"This was a really interesting place to visit.Free on the first Tuesday of the month.The tour guide was very good, and interesting",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelbug1261
50,Interesting tour,I’m really glad we squeezed in a trip to this unique area. We took a guided tour that’s free with your admission. We got a lot more out of it with this tour.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brgreen
40,Interesting place,"I had no idea that tar was a naturally occurring substance that was mined. There were interesting facts like this and, of course, the animals who got stuck through the years. The exhibit building had an area where I could watch people clean the animal bones, as new ones are continuously brought up out of the tar.While most of the tar areas are fenced, there are a few small places where it has bubbled up and they are marked with cones. One young lad cleverly used a stick to scoop up some tar so we could watch it drip. We could see how easily a creature could get stuck in it.I only had an hour and had to run through the building and outdoor areas, but it was well worth the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aquazoo
50,Brilliant day,"We had heard of the tar pits,I think it was on the Simpsons. We did not realise it was in the middle of the city. We were on a hop hop off bus when we spotted it on the tour map.An excellent exhibition and a professsional and informative walk round the museum and the grounds were a bonus. We would recommend to everybody",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andylDorset
50,A review that sinks outside the box,"So I didn't actually pay for admission, on account of not having enough time to explore the whole area. But just from walking around the building's perimeter, you can still experience the majesty of the smelly asphalt death traps, and for only 0/15ths of the price. You can learn about all the different animals from different eras that drowned here, as well as the different predators that preyed on the drowning animals that also drowned. While I was there, the perimeter path also featured a lovely colorful walkthrough art exhibition that seemed primarily designed for unoriginal Instagram selfies, but this exhibit had a disturbing lack of drowning prehistoric animals. 11/10 stars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/benofalltrades22
50,Fabulous Museum & Artefacts,"I actually visited in June 2018, however due to travelling all over the world for the last 18 months, I am just in the process of writing all the reviews. What’s really interesting about this place is that there’s a park which is completely free to the public with little info plaques to learn more about the tar pits. The admission is only for the museum and the observation deck. It was included in the Go Card pass. The museum has some very knowledgeable staff working there who are happy to explain the artefacts on display. There’s quite a few perfectly preserved fossils on display which were all found in the tar pits when humans began digging for oil. Pit 91 is still active today which scientists dig to find more fossils. The fossils are then sorted and cleaned in the museum’s research lab! There’s another area called Project 23; during construction of the neighbouring car park, builders found some fossils and worked with scientists to carefully fill 23 crates of material containing fossils. The museum are still currently sorting through that as well. Those are both free to get into. Inside the museum are also Native American artefacts which date back about 1,500 years. What’s fascinating about this is that the museum work closely with the descendants of the tribes and actually learn about migration patterns of some extinct animals as the stories have been verbally passed down through generations from their ancestors who walked with animals like mammoths! Some of the artefacts include water carriers and bowls which were made using the tar as a super glue and a waterproof coating. One of the guides explained the process to us which was fascinating. It’s definitely worth a visit; I enjoyed both the museum and the park and it only takes about 90 minutes but I couldn’t get over the fact, they offer access to the park for free! It makes a change from the rip off museums.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VikkiBee
50,Something oddly soothing about it,"In both of my last trips to LA I’ve been to the tar pits by chance and I really like place. It’s a peaceful park, has a distinct scent (that some may not like but I do) and there’s just something calming about watching the tar bubble to the surface. I’d take my lunch breaks there if I worked in the area. Didn’t go to the museum this time but it is worth it at least once.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ewamaine
50,A wish come true,I remember this place from TV in the 60s and so wanted to visit. I wasn't disappointed. if you have the slightest interest in real fossils and ancient history you need to visit this place,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Friar-1962
40,Tar tar,"Cool place to visit... snap shot of our past... good place for families to visit, it’s not Hollywood, actually its better, it’s real !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Days_Gone_2019
40,Who would have thought in the middle of LA,"Its not very big, so adults might be a little disappointed but it's so very interesting and there is heaps for kids to keep them interested.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rainy0
40,"Fun, But Pricey","Really nice, spacious museum. My son is 2 years and he really enjoyed looking at the models, fossils, and playing with some of the interactive stuff.I really enjoyed the museum too. It isn’t too big, but the exhibits were well done and very cool.There is also areas to check out outside like the tar pits, statues, and active diggining sites.My only thing was that it was pretty pricey. Parking was $15. Admission was $15 (x2).Nice and fun museum, just comes at a high cost to enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hilo88
40,Nice old bones,"Worth a quick visit in central LA, nice staff, very helpful, and can be tied in with other things to do in teh area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NigelAllam
40,Fun Museum and Park,"First of all- there is a lot to see in the surrounding park and it is free of cost! You truly forget that you’re in a bustling city while here. The whole park and museum is very educational. The museum offers student and senior discounts. It was really cool to see the conservation efforts that are taking place right now! Staff was interactive, friendly and informative. We spent a couple of hours here and it was well-worth the ticket price.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2010mikester44
50,"Excellent museum and conservation site, all ages will enjoy","An on-site museum housing and featuring the millions of fossils excavated in the nearby tar pits (which are inaccurately named, as was repeatedly explained to us).All around excellent. There are Imax shows, live saber tooth puppet show, a mummified baby mammoth, lots of huge fossils, a place where you can test the stickiness of tar for yourself, and more and more.Besides all that, it's an active excavation and conservation site, so you get to watch and talk to people cleaning the actual fossils, both inside in a lab and outside on location.Children were loving it, and us adults too honestly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BassemPrime
50,Amazing,"Fantastic and interesting, you can look into a pit and see the actual skull of a saber tooth tiger... what could be better then that! Museum is well worth the price and not to be missed",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dudoldve
50,A day outing,"Spent a beautiful early autumn Sunday at this very worthwhile institution with my wife, our adult daughter and her 3 young children only one of whom is already in school. The complex spoke to all three generations. There were informativesigns and staff, a 3D film and an educational theater performance. All sorts of hands-on displays. The gift shop was a bit skimpy but who needs to buy anyrhing? The park surrounding the building as well as the landscaped pits within the museum itself were all tastefully set out. Even some picnic tables near a comfort station just outside the entrance to the museum. In short, a very good choice of activities for the whole family. Maybe a snack shop or small cafe for a quick shot of sugar or caffeine might have made it perfect. Machines just don't do it for me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bfindysz
30,Dont bother paying,The museum itself isnt worth the entrance fee.. don't pay and just wander around the grounds for free,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Spike_PKH
40,La Brea Tar pits,We visited the La Brea tar pits with the whole family - definitely something different to the rest of of Californian driving holiday. We did in 2 parts with a visit also to the gallery next door for lunch and a look at a few galleries.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carolineb455
50,Good Value,"Easy access, lots to see, and will not break the bank. Different tours available along with a souvenir shop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mbehmazia123
50,"Active, urban Ice Age excavation site!",In the heart of LA you can see active tar pits. Amazing when you think about it. The museum offers a window into the excavation of the last 100 years. .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kathleen917
40,Inspiring,"The grounds are open to the public, we never did go into the Museum. It is a nice place to take a break off Wilshire Boulevard in between LACMA and the Craft Museum, close to the Peterson Automobile Museum and the soon to be opened Academy Museum. The tar pits themselves are awe inspiring if you think about what the place must have been like when it was just the Tongva people here. The still liquid occasionally allows methhane gas bubbles to rise.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/catherinemL8442JB
50,Fun and educational,"We visited on the first Tuesday of the month, so the museum and grounds were free. It was well-laid out and interactive. Parking on the street was easy too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T294YDstacys
50,Piece of History,"Nice piece of history in the heart of the modern city. Together with Peterson Automotive Museum, Lacma and The Grove/ Farmers Market, great option how spend nearly whole day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Thomasero
50,Wonderful and unique site in Los Angeles,"We have been many times, but we took our grandsons (elementary school and junior high) this summer and they loved it too. Something you can only do in Los Angeles! Perfect for all ages. Very manageable museum - easily seen in a fairly short time. Volunteer docents augment the experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lizcraven
40,Nice surprise,"Actually stopped for the art installation that wasn't that exciting and went to the museum. Not from LA I was aware of this place as a kid from Brady Bunch or some other 60's or 70's show. My wife had never heard of it and was amazed that a tar pit excavation site was in the middle of a city. Pay for parking and museum. Other pay to enter art museums in same block along with the soon to open Motion Picture Academy museum. Museum was small, a little dated, but full of fascinating creatures and tons of tar stained bones. Nice park grounds with fenced off open pits and some pavilions with active digs. Also active bone lab where you can watch interns clean bones. Worth checking out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevendale
20,"Informative, but constant employee panhandling/upselling","The museum itself was informative. But it sort of seems to be a 2019 museum stuck in the 1970's. Although informative, it just seemed old and out of date.My main complaint is the employee panhandling. I realize they are just doing their job - but when I wanted to buy a ticket to the museum - no I don't want to donate, no I don't want to be a member, no, I don't want to pay extra to see the movie.Then after buying a t-shirt for $26.99 (highest price I've seen for a t-shirt at any museum) in the giftshop, I was asked if I wanted to ""round-up"" as a donation, no. Did I want to buy a $4 or smaller $3 bag to put my purchase in, no. Then the clerk proceeded to fold my t-shirt up into a roughly 6x9 size and stuff it into a flat roughly 6x8 paper bag with the top of the t-shirt sticking out. The bag itself was cheap paper which ripped shortly after leaving the museum.When I asked if there were any larger bags with handles so I could actually carry my purchase, I was told no, only if you buy one for $3 or $4. Pleeeeeeaaaase.... even Walmart has bags for 10 cents with handles. Lesson learned, bring a bag.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KenZ_GA
50,Well worth seeing,One of the most unique and interesting places in the city. If you are into the prehistoric era then this place is for you. Lots to be learned here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Flyer780991
50,A step into history,Kids loved this. Super interesting. They have water fill stations in the museum by the bathrooms. No food on property but staff very nicely provided a map with nearby food locations. The pit excavation was amazing. Where else can you see an active dig?!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dmlail42
50,Few things are actually UNIQUE. The LaBrea tar pits *are*.,"Where does oil come from? Deep beneath the ground. When it bubbles up to the surface, usually someone declares it an oil field, pumps are set up, and unless you work there, you won't see this in nature.The LaBrea tar pits are a terrible oil field (the quality of the tar/oil is not suitable for refining) but an amazing archaeological site. For the past 40,000 years or so, animals and other things have gotten stuck in the tar and preserved. For the past hundred years, we've been slowly digging them out. The museum has exhibits about those animals and the history of the tar pits (how indigenous people and others used the tar). I agree with other reviewers that the museum is not the best thing about the park - you'll have to decide if you want to see the 'preserved tar pit' and museum, or just see the amazing park.There is a parking lot (pay to park).Stay mostly on the paths and look out for little cones - those mark current asphalt ""oozes"", and you (or your kids) can lose a shoe to the sticky tar. So stay away from the cones, and be careful where you step. You can walk on the grass, even bring a picnic, but be aware that this is an actual active tar pit. Don't wear your best shoes, and be aware you might get a stain that will never come out.There's a large tar lake at one end of the park where you can see and smell the tar in all its glory, and see methane bubbles rising. The smell is not overwhelming, it's interesting. There are several smaller pits, and a tent where you can watch volunteers, scientists, and graduate students slowly excavating one of the pits. I found that fascinating, personally (but I'm a scientist).The park also has statues of some of the species recovered from the pits...nice photo spots. Guess how large a ""giant ground sloth"" is before you find the answer. And why do you think there's a picture of a camel there? Answers to these and other questions at the park (and in the museum). When we were there, there was also a (temporary) walk-in art exhibit that was interesting.Whether you're into science or not, this is a must-see. You almost certainly have never seen anything like this, and probably never will. It's amazing. If you're into science, spend the bucks and also visit the museum.About the museum, there are the cutest stuffed animals there. Probably not the most accurate representations, but adorable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Loribbb
50,"""Worth a Visit""",To see the Tar still oozing from the ground makes you think how many animals were taken way back when glad we made the visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Explore694115
50,Fun piece of history - worth the stop,"This was my second trip to the tar pits, and I enjoyed it as much as the first time! It's a great visit because it's easy to access, clean and safe, and fascinating to see. One of my favorite parts is stopping to just watch the bubbles rise and pop. It's one thing to read about the how the earth works, but it's another to see it up close and personal. We also did the museum this time, and while small, it's still great to experience. Lots of examples of the animals that used to roam right in this area, and ultimately met their demise here. Also a very knowledgeable and friendly staff who were very willing to share facts.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robbiem271
30,Worth a quick look,"We got of the hop on hop off bus at this stop and spent about an hour here, this is an interesting place, if somewhat smelly. We didn’t go in the museum but felt we had gained knowledge through the external exhibits",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GO50
50,Amazing tar pit,"This was an incredible museum that had active tar pits. We just happened to visit on the third Tuesday of the month and the $15 entrance fee was $0!!! We paid $5 for the 3D movie about the tar pits. The movie gives you a great history of the tar pits and the museum. Loved it.I was blown away at the incredible skeletons of prehistoric mammals. So many. They had a nice jungle type area in the interior of the museum. Knowledgeable volunteers stroll around answering questions. Fun interactive activities for all to enjoy.We parked in the back of the building ($15) and had a bit of a walk to get to the entrance. Don't know what parking is on the front side of the park.The museum is very accessable for wheelchairs.They have a nice gift shop. Great items.In the museum is an active lab where volunteers are cleaning small bones that have been taken from the tar pits. Visitors can watch them work through the glass.There is a roped off area out front that has gurgling, active tar pits. Absolutely fascinating!!!This is a MUST SEE place while in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LynnS290
50,Active Excavation Site,Very Unusual Excavation Site - Active Site with the recovery of naturally preserved animals of the past - The Tar prevents the deterioration to show the real thing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/634douglast
30,A Bit of a Disappointment,"I guess it is ok for little ones, but if you've been the the Natural History Museum in LA or NY, don't bother. I hear they are going to remodel so I'd wait and call first before going. There's a movie you have to pay extra for (not that great and SHOULD be part of what you get with your entrance fee). There's a window that looks into a lab where people are working on bones - tiny specs of bones - and after spending 60 seconds there, your more than done. There really isn't anything magnificent or awe inspiring. The one large skeleton is that of a mammoth. This is a serious ""nothing"". Save you time and your money and go somewhere else...at least until they remodel and hopefully put something in it to make it an attraction. The most interesting thing is FREE and OUTSIDE of the museum - and that is the Tar Pits. That is really amazing and I understand expanding all by itself into the street and across the street. The Museum is also designing a new exhibit of the bubbling tar (I'm sure so that they can charge you for something that is visible from the street and has been for at least a 1/2 century). This place is immediately next door to LACMA - Los Angeles County Museum of Art. They are also remodeling but the patio and some free areas are worth visiting. During the summer there are concerts there and stands to buy water and beverages. Call to see when the museum will be finished so you can really enjoy it. It does share the same land with the La Brea Tar Pits and Museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/judysinger
40,Cool place to visit,We visited the tar pits on our recent trip to LA and it was worth a visit. The tar itself was really interesting to watch and then we made our way into the museum. The exhibits were well displayed and it was cool to see animals that we hadn't seen before such as the direwolves.My favourite part of the museum was the mammoth tusks that were in a protective coating and also the lab technicians that we could see working behind the windows.Perhaps on the pricier side but most museums are.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/samkuzmar
50,Never disappoints,"I was 12 years old the first time I visited the LaBrea tarpits with my grandmother. Been here with out of town guests for as long as I lived in the LA area.Recently, on the way to taking me to the airport, my daughter suggested we stop at the LaBrea tarpits. Well, it had been 25 years since I'd last been, so it sounded fun. And it was. It always is. This is the only museum on earth like this! It is amazing, informative, interesting, thought provoking, everything a museum should be. It hasn't changed a great deal in the ensuing years, but it is always a lovely way to spend an afternoon. We toured the museum, watched the video, walked past the dinosaurs in the actual tar, strolled the gardens. As wonderful as I remember!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/slygal718
40,Very interesting!,The only working museum like it in the world! Very informative and unique! Must see for anyone interested in fossils.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karendQ3003UH
50,A real life Museum,What I like about the La Brea tar Pits is that it's still active. They are still uncovering bones from the tar. Still working in the muck and have put a great display around the museum. Thought the price was a little high. But I feel that way with most museums.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BigEvilBaby
50,Check hours before you go,The park is very interesting . I just stumble on it after visiting LA county museum. It was very insightful. The museum was closed but I could still learn something from the info displayed around the park.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O6378WFannag
50,Spooky!,"Hard to imagine a site like this in the center of a big city, but ... where dinosaurs went to die and where the tar continues to bubble up. Archaeological exhibits well worth seeing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeneR3
40,Tar very much,"The tar pits themselves are free and part of the park, with the models of the mammoths. If you can stretch to the entry fee for the museum it’s even better with lots more creatures and educational interactive stuff for the kids. There’s metered Parking just outside too. Great museum, unusual and well put together.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Montalaban
50,Great place to see a bit of our area's natural history,"My wife and I were here with 3 of my relatives from NYC. They do not speak English very well, so I interpreted for them and they were fascinated by the animals and the tar pits. Seeing the replicas of the mammoths trapped in the bubbling tar pits, and then going indoors to see the various animals that were trapped there and now the bones are cleaned for us to see.The Museum is well organized into different areas and it was nice to be able to wander through and see the various animals, the evolution and get an excellent idea of what the animals were like in this area. You'll see forerunner of the elephants, and there are Mammoths, Mastodons, Pgymy Mammoth, Woolly Mammoth ...We had been here about 2 years ago with other relatives with young kids and everybody enjoyed it thoroughly. The saber-tooth cat jumping on a bear with its sounds is a bit ... strange, but kids loved it. Also, bones and other objects that you can touch were also good.I would highly recommend it for anybody even with a slight interest in evolution, animals, or what our area looked like way WAY back!Lots to learn and just for fun.Staff at entrance and for tickets were very nice and helpful.Plenty of restaurants around that areaCheck their website for price tickets, possible discounts, etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y8522EAleec
40,The free part is enough of a visit,"Having not realised how much was outside and free I paid for 2 (reduced price, online deal) tickets. Although the museum was interesting, it isn't worth full price, especially when the cinema showing is another 5 bucks per person on top!My advice, see the free stuff and if you are really compelled then get a reduced price ticket for the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoshAdvisor
50,Everyone LOVED this - even my snarky Teenager,"We LOVED visiting the Tar Pits, the museum is terrific, and we couldn't get over all the tar just bubbling up (like in the parking lot)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lisaeck
50,Fun trip,We loved the tar pits. My 12 year old son loved seeing the dino bones and seeing tar bubble up. It was fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jameseF4303NR
40,Great for all ages!,"Although I've cut through the park area with the La Brea Tar Pits many times on my way to LACMA and smelled ancient history, this time I stopped and visited the Page Museum. I learned a lot about ancient mammals that roamed this area including the American Lion and watched mostly volunteers in the window lab meticulously brush through dust from the tar pits. Although I didn't participate in one of their many guided tours, I did check out their well-stocked shop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlobalGypsy_13
30,Overpriced small museum,"This was the reason we stopped in Hollywood on our road trip and it was pretty disappointing. The tar pits are outside and free and pretty interesting but very smelly, the museum is on the expensive side especially for how small it is - and the staff had no idea what was around there, when we asked if there was anywhere to eat she recommended a pizza place up the street a few blocks, but when we walked around the complex there was a whole patio full of places to eat and sit next to the art museum on the same block!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/erin123452019
50,A hidden jewel,"Wonderful place. Superb for kids. You will see the remains of the american mammut, wolves, saber tooth tiger, etc. Well worth the $15.TIP: do NOT pay $15 to park in their lot. Just park in the street for free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Buceri
50,What's up doc?,"After hearing this name in the Bugs Bunny cartoons as a kid, I wanted to see them for myself. Museum and visit worth the ticket.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/happyinparistimestwo
30,A Fascinating Detour,"The La Brea Tar Pits was a fascinating detour on a day otherwise filled with Hollywood tourism. We didn't care to visit the museum, but a walk around the pit provided lots of information and a first-hand look at a truly unique site. I was amazed that the whole park actually smells like tar. There was even tar on some of the plants. The only negative was the high number of homeless people everywhere you looked.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sloomis31
50,Unique experience,"As other reviewers had noted, this is a completely unique place. The observation pit alone is fascinating. It’s utterly incredible how many remains have been discovered so far and wonderful that those excavations are on-going (and visible to visitors).The museum itself provides lots of information and is pretty interactive for younger children.A definite for any itinerary!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/369Hilaryx
50,Museum is informative and love the pits,"La Brea tar pits is like no other location that you can visit. First the museum is well done and informative. Many displays showcase finds from the tar pits.Beyond the displays, visiting the actual pits around the grounds is truly fascinating and unique. There are several pits that are located nearby and there is signage. Two of these pits allow you to see fossils in situ. One of these was very oily andwhereas the other was dry. Labels allowed you to see what you were looking at. There’s also areas of seepage of “tar” scattered about the grounds.We also learned about and an going project whereby specimens Removed during construction of a new parking garage are being studied and we had a chance to meet one of the scientists working on the materials stored in crates on the grounds.A truly unique experience that you cannot find anywhere else. I highly recommend a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LSQRD1
50,Incredible,"It was a really interesting experience.We went to the museum and also saw Titans of The Ice Age. It's hard to believe that this is right in the heart of Los Angeles! There was so much to see and learn, both inside the museum and outside where the tar pits are located. The number of fossils recovered is staggering and it was amazing to see so many of them on display. The smell of tar is, understandably, incredibly strong outside but, if you can cope with that, it's well work walking around. The tar pit actually bubbles up right in front of your eyes! Definitely worth going to see",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AMMWS
50,First visit,No idea what to expect but had a great visit. The history you can read and see photos about this part of LA were really interesting. The fossil collections are also really impressive and educational. Staff were great and very knowledgeable on subject matter.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robsO8154RG
40,Informative. Well set up. Takes 2-3 Hours,"Visited with 2 teenage daughters and spent about two hours. We could have spent longer observing the outside active digs. The museum does a good job both with the history of the tar pits area and describing how ancient man and mammals lived. Open pits outside show both the risk of the area and the active archeological digs still ongoing. The surrounding area is nice with trees and you could spend much more time here enjoying the area than the two hours we allotted. Nice little gift shop at the end for souvenirs. Worth a visit for anyone but especially fans of archeology or the Ice Age kids movies, lol.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravellingWallbury
40,More to see & learn about than I had thought . . .,"My wife & I went here on a Friday afternoon and really had a good time. I thought it as going to be one of those “Vacation” moments where you looked at it for 5 minutes and were off to the next thing. I obviously had no clue what this was all about and how it fit into the fabric & history of the area. Was amazing to see how much continues to be learned from the area. We got tickets to the museum and went through it. Saw the movie and interacted with the docents. Museum was a great time for kids. We really enjoyed walking the grounds/park area. Much to see, learn and relax in this scenic area. Highly recommend and glad we went and had the time to take in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mini6322
40,interesting,"very interesting and a great place to take kids of most ages, the Pits are close to the LA museum of art as well",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barbarabuilder
40,A piece of another era smack in the middle of the city.,"I never realized the Tar Pits were in the middle of downtown LA! This was very cool. We didn't go into the museum, however, which probably would have been a great addition to walking around and checking the place out. It was fun to watch the tar bubbling in the pits for a few minutes, though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Compass592335
40,Interesting... Like outside better than inside,"The outside was more interesting to me than the inside. We paid the admission and we're through the museum very quickly. (If you've been to other natural history museums, there's not a lot you haven't seen. I didn't see (inside) a lot of information about the formation of the pits, so I asked a volunteer who said she didn't know, but guessed and it was way off. Once you go outside (which is an open park), there's lots more information on the signs outside. So, except that I was supporting the local natural history museum, I would have skipped inside and just done the free stuff outside. But, if you haven't been to a bunch of natural history museums, you will find all of it very informative. It's a lovely facility.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CobbCoGA
50,"Great museum for history, dinosaurs, Los Angeles","A great museum and history lesson, at at once. Highly recommended outing for anybody interested in history, dinosaurs, or Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanaLosAngeles
50,"Awesome, educational and informative",Such a nice find in the LA area. Learned a lot and the tour guides were great. Worth checking out if you are in the area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nwp72
40,Educational and Enjoyable!,There is plenty to see outside of the museum free of charge - and lots of places to have a picnic lunch break. The museum is also a great place to visit. I found the whole experience educational and fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kimberlycC7270IY
30,The Pits,"We wandered around the various pits, some of which resembled a filthy pond but others showed you what fossils had been discovered. A number of interesting information boards told you the story of the tar pits. Didn’t bother with the museum. Parking was $15 so probably better to park in the street.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IainTwaddle
50,"Great, Unique Experience","I have lived near LA for over 30 years and finally made it to the Tar Pits. This has always been on my list of things to do with my kids and I am so glad we finally got a chance to go.We went on a very cold, rainy day which was kind of nice because it was not crowded at all. We spent time wondering through the small museum and looking at the very informative exhibits. I really enjoyed watching the scientists work on artifacts right in front of us - quite fascinating.After touring the inside we walked around the tar pits. What a unique thing to see right in the middle of downtown LA! I guess WHERE it is located makes it even more remarkable for me.I really enjoyed it and so did my 13 and 16 year old sons. I definitely recommend this for families looking for something to do with their kids or science geeks who would like a unique science experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jennlovesfood
50,Always interesting even tho I have been there dozens oif times!,"This whole destination of the Tar Pits, the grounds/lawns, Japanese Pavilion...LACMA and surrounds...a few restaurants and they even do concerts...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/84trudig
40,Interesting,"Tar pits are interesting. They’re sorta spread out around the park. They just look like mud, but with bones and things sticking out. There’s a really big one near the entrance to the fossil museum that bubbles. You can either chill in the park or pay for the museum, where you can see more bones. We spent maybe an hour and a half walking around, seeing the museum and watching a short movie about its history. It was cool but very short. I just wish there was more to the tar pits. But it’s apart of history, and great for children. You really learn a lot about mammoths and ice age animals. No dinosaur bones, to my knowledge.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Smarttraveler30
50,Wonderful place to visit,The museum itself is great although the shows are pretty poor. The staff are really knowledgeable and informative. The exhibits are amazing. The park outside is free to walk around and there is plenty of information. Very easy to step on wet tar so need to be careful and stick to paths. Seems amazing having the tar pits so close to Hollywood,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jillf562
40,Relaxing Grounds,The museum is nice enough. Maybe a little better than I expected but kind of sparse. Not very extensive. The movies all cost extra and are not part of the basic admission.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O3993SYtomc
50,A trip to another era,"Go back 100 to 1million years ago at the La Brea Tar Pits. It's so cool to see the reconstructed skeletons of extinct creature caught in the asphalt pits years ago. View a active dig in one of the pits. See how they remove blocks of asphalt with fossils encased inside. Great for young kids, tweens, teens and adults. Bring a picnic and enjoy lunch out in the surrounding park. FYI It does smell like petroleum outside. Spend 1-2 hours here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brawny2016
50,Very cool to visit!,"I enjoyed this more than I'd anticipated. I was pleasantly surprised by the size and quality of the museum at the tar pits. Also, they are still digging at one of the pits, and I really liked seeing how they manage the asphalt while digging for fossils.This is still a dynamic area - new tar seeps pop up all the time. They mark these with a cone.I'd recommend taking in one or more of the talks. We did the Project 23 talk and the Excavator talk. Both were interesting and covered different material.We watched the 3D movie. It was okay - not mind blowing, but worth the $5. And it was nice to have some AC after walking around outside.Through Nov 2019, you can also tour the Second Home Serpentine Pavilion by SelgasCano at La Brea Tar Pits. It is right there at the tar pits, and tickets are free online.We spent about 2.5-3 hours at the tar pits in total.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ColoradoPeltier
50,Fascinating!,"I have an interest in biological anthropology, so my sister and I decided to check out the Tar Pits during our recent trip to LA. We were not disappointed!The indoor museum is not large, but the exhibits are interesting. I particularly enjoyed the Fossil Lab exhibit, in which researchers and volunteers actively clean and study fossils found in the tar pits. However, the outdoor tar pits themselves are (unsurprisingly) the highlight of the experience.II highly recommend taking a tour or participating in their free programs. We really enjoyed the the the Project 23 Revealed tour, and felt it provided greater context for understanding and appreciating the research being done at the museum.All in all, a great way to spend a morning in Los Angeles!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/margarettravels1
50,History in LA!,"I can't believe there's so much history right in the heart of LA! The site is still producing amazing discoveries almost dailey! Check it out, and be surprised!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dwy1
40,Good mid day visit,Not in most of travel guides but an interesting visit to mix with Farmers market. This is an old park where Brea was collected (still is coming) and a museum. Museum is Ok but little overpriced but park deserves a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Acivipam
40,"Get to the Pits, Now!","Forget what you know about tar pits and woolly mammoths! Go to the museum now and get the real skinny. Go before they are swallowed up, no fault of their own. Built in 1977, the Page museum oozes with 70s Modernist style, your kids will be looking for touch screens, while the adults will be reminded of grade school museum trips. It is well worth the two hours you will need to explore the museum, walk the pits, and hit the gift shop. You can watch the site's researchers examining and classifying fossils, and see the iconic tar pit! No food here, but there's grub right next door at the LA County Museum of Art, and according to the LACMA's web site, you don't need a ticket to visit their restaurants. Note, the LACMA is CLOSED ON WEDNESDAY!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GoPlaces591872
50,Mind Opening,This was my first visit to the La Brea Tar Pits and Museum. This was mind blowing. It was hard to believe that they are still finding fossils from the Ice Age here. The museum was very informative and the staff were friendly and helpful. It is worth another visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CurtK815
40,Interesting Slice of History,"Many people told us not to miss the La Brea Tar Pits on our visit to the LA area, so we made a point to go. It was interesting to see actual tar pits where prehistoric beasts were fossilized, and the indoor museum puts it in context. We found the staff to be very helpful in answering questions about each exhibit. If you have a kid who is very into dinosaurs, this would be a can't-miss; for everyone else, it's a good place to spend 2 hours during your trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/239jacquic
30,"Fun for kids, not for me","The museum was small, not that interesting and seemed like a waste of money. The pit itself was cool, and free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/preisman
50,Had a fun time!,"It was my first time coming here and I really liked my experience. For LA residents, on certain days, its free from 3pm to 5pm, and I would actually suggest coming on those times. You can do everything here within the span of two hours. I was surprised that they have really nice items in their giftshops, and they even have 3d films! The museum itself is rather small, but it goes by rather quick. There's also lots of nice spots to explore on the outside, and its cool how its also connected to some outside spots for LACMA. I enjoyed my time here and I definitely want to return on the weekend and they have certain things only playing Friday, Saturdays, and Sundays.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fistoflight
50,A Fun Visit to the LaBrea Tar Pits and Museum,"Even if you don't have children along, the Tar Pits are a wonder, a look way back into history. I've been with adult visitors and also with children visitors. There is a neat walk around the various pits outside with models of the animals who were there. Included is a lovely, relaxing garden with tall plants. Inside there is much information about the region, the fossils, areas where current research is taking place and many well-versed people to answer questions. A wonderful way to spend some time relaxing, and learning about our history. The young children with us had an enjoyable time and lots of questions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/smreardon
40,Nice outing,My grandchildren age 3 & 5 enjoyed the large dinosaurs and videos. I think they would have enjoyed the movie but we were too late to get tickets. I believe a little older kids would get more out of this. The adults in our group found it interesting,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MoparMan52
30,Great for kids...ok for adukts,Glad I went on a free day. My friend really wanted to check it out. There's not a whole lot to captivate the attention of an adult but definitely looked like fun for the kids there. Great place for field trips.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sindles
40,Granddaughter enjoyed the day here,"The Second Home Pavilion exhibit on the grounds of the La Brea Tar Pits will be there until November of this year. We obtained online Express Entry tickets to this exhibit, hoping to beat standing in a long line. The VERY colorful tunnels were fun for my 5-year-old granddaughter to explore. Afterwards, we went into the George Page Museum to discover huge skeletons of mammoths, saber-toothed cats, Dire wolves, etc. that have been found in the tar on the grounds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lenak63
40,Very interesting,"It was pretty crowded to get in on a Sunday afternoon and we did have to wait a little bit. It was really neat to see all of us fossils, exhibits and displays. The best part was seeing the active tar pits. No one was working in the pits when we were there. You can learn alot here as they have plenty of staff around with artifacts to talk to you about. There is also a couple movies you can see for an additional cost. We didn't have time for those. It was a beautiful day to walk around the grounds and look at the outside exhibits. If you are interested in fossils etc. This is worth the time checking out.(Christa)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidjensen399
40,Sciency Must See,Good way to spend a large part of your day- just something to see if you’re from out of town because you’ll not see this anywhere else. Beautiful paths and parkland to wander at your own pace. And inside is very interesting for those that like their history. Younger kids will dig this place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/660rickd
30,Unique,"I'd say this was good, a little better than average, but not quite to very good. It was really cool. The kids were not happy with the smell, but that can't be helped. We spent a couple of hours there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/575mege
40,Worth A Visit,This was an interesting stop. There are still active Tar Pits and an ongoing pit dig. Seeing them working on the dig and the bones that where visible still in the tar was very cool.Wonderful museum as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/534andyd
50,Incredible Active Historic Site,"We've been to many museums, but few are living and actively worked. The Tar Pits were fascinating to view (and reminded me of the movie Volcano), and seeing them actively excavacting for science was really cool.The museum itself was wonderful, and although we didn't attend any shows, there was enough that we could see walking around to keep us there for quite some time. People were very friendly and explained some of the lab work going on where you can watch as they uncover fossil specimens.This is one of my favorite places for history in America.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jandc5744
40,Black gold,Walking around the Tarr Pits was amazing. The place smells of oil and the pools are still active - the wrold really is alive. The fossils and the history of finding the fosils is fascinating.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sega1964
50,See the creatures they have extracted from the ancient tar!,"See the creatures they have extracted from the ancient tar! This is near the LA County Art Museum, which you can go to next.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/curioustraveler406
50,Interesting museum,"Interesting museum.Linking dinosaurs to evolution and excavations in this historical area, while searching for oil in the XX century.Owner first came to Californja with less than 2 dollars in 1917, and in 1980 opened the museum for sharing with kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RamonFP1
40,it's The Pits!!,"I have heard about the La Brea Tar Pits all my life, and wanted to see them while I was in LA. It is an amazing sight to both see and consider that the bubbling tar one sees today has been there since prehistoric times. There is also a museum (admission charge) but to see the pits alone is free, and one can't do better than that!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jimtZ7231HS
40,As in the Stranglers Song - Dead Loss Angeles,Just had to go and see La Brea Pit. Have been listening to this since 1979 in the lyrics of the Stranglers song featured on the Raven album.Interesting place & yes there is a model Mastodon. Whats more if you look at the Pits you can see the tar bubbling up from the ground.A really interesting place to go,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DuncanRound
50,Unique museum - small but packed with interesting things,"I had been to LaBrea Tar Pits when I was a child - but didn't remember much. When I went this year with my family I found a real treat. A nice museum has been built to showcase some of the work they have done and are doing currently in the tar pits. Thousands and thousands of fossils ranging in size from minute bugs to mastadons have been found. Very interesting, unique, great location, easy parking and not too pricey. A great value.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmyBCooper
50,A bit of tar ?,A good day out you can see how the dinosaurs got stuck in the tar with a small museum at the side to explain what happened to them .Also have a working lab .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/404christiner404
50,Better than expected...went for an hour and spent all day!,"We went on the first Tuesday of the month which is free admission to the museum. The tar pits in the park are free and cool enough on their own with tons of interesting information too. I just happened to ask an attendant about a map, and he was delighted to share lots of info with us...including that it was free on that day to see the museum. The museum...oh, I would not pass that up and would have gladly paid the entry had I known how awesome it would be. My husband and I wandered around there for hours and never had a dull moment. To know that you are looking at the actual fossilized remains of these huge creatures that once walked on the very ground we stood on...AMAZING.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tammyc586
50,Very interesting and unexpected,I really enjoyed my visit and wish that I had allocated more time. It's across the street from the Peterson Auto Museum and another LA Art museum so you make a day of visiting all three places if you use your time wisely.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/220kenq
40,Quick and easy,"This was a fun, quick and easy museum to take the whole family too. I would not recommend paying for this but get the Go Los Angeles Card and joy for an all-inclusive price!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/732beckyu
50,So I interesting!,I was in such awe while visiting this museum. There are actual tar pits on the property that you can see and smell for sure. There are fossils that they've put up and show you the actual size of the animals. There is a lab inside where you can watch them doing live work. They even have a container of tar for you to feel just how hard it would have been for the animals that got stuck.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Liondalou
50,Wow !,I wouldn’t hesitate recommending this extraordinary museum. It is so interesting and unusual. Imagine finding a soup of mixed bones of animals that lived from the ice age to now? That’s what this museum exhibits as a result of the tar which continues to preserve everything caught in it and bubbles bring it all to the surface!A must do when in Los Angeles for all ages but particularly if you have young ones in tow.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lucy787
50,Super cool and unique,"Tar litterally bubbles up from the ground, and the bones of the animals trapped here are displayed--giant sloths, mammoths, etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cookpias
50,Amazed,This place had been on my list of things to do for years and I wasnt disappointed. It is well worth a visit if you have time while in LA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PeteSheringham
50,Visit to La Brea Tar Pits,Extremely interesting place to visit to. Learn how natural asphalt has seeped up from the ground in this area for tens of thousands of year and how scientist are uncovering the preserved bones of trapped ice age animals.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Statenali
50,Saving the bones,"If you want to visit the past, this is a definite stop on your visit. The tar pits are a remarkable reminder that oil has been under Los Angeles for a very long time. Besides oil derricks, the asphalt still seeps to the service at the tar pits. Hands on in the museum is for all ages. Watching volunteers clean bones and finding all types of insects, plants and microscopic animals is amazing. I definitely recommend going to la brea tar pits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/susanhS2261IV
50,Interesting pits in a park,"I didn’t even bother with the paid museum, just walked around the tar pits, which had a lot of info about the work and discoveries. Close to LACMA and the Petersen Museum, well worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrdom
50,Great fun. And can be free,Great place to have some relaxing fun. Paid to park then walked the park for free. Great for kids. Will go again!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LostinTransit10
50,Amazing,Jaw dropping amazing when you go look into the tap pits and see what they are bringing out. Do the museum first so you get the whole experience! So worth it!!!!!!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/momtks
40,Something completely different in LA,"Fascinating place. Definitely worth a visit . A sharp contrast to urban LA. Two parts - one being the neatly kept grounds ( free) where you can observe several tar pits bubbling from time to time - the other being a well put together museum (fee) with lots of exhibits of the animals found in the pits. The museum fee also covered several interesting short films which helped our understanding of the unique nature of La Brea tar pits. The museum could have been a bit more interactive as cabinets of bones aren't for everyone, particularly when you discover that this is an active archeological site . Parking was an additional fee but there were ample spaces on the day we visited.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lightfader
40,La Brea Tar Pits in LA,Very interesting attraction and museum. Much of it is outside as you walk around and see various tar pits and current digs going on. Museum has lots of detail and it is amazing the amount of material that has already been recovered from the pits. Glad we stopped and saw it as we have heard about it for many years.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Foxyfive
40,Interesting history - worth a look,The museum is quite interesting - well set out and provides a detailed explanation of the work that continues to be performed at the site to this day.The pits in the outside areas that surround the museum reveal how the palaeontologists excavate the site and clean/catalogue the fossils. Fascinating visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thorneta
40,Childhood Dream Made a Reality,"I read about the La Brea Tar Pits when I was in grade school. I’d always wanted to visit here, and my husband suggested it, not knowing i wanted to go! It was a great time, but I’d suggest the following.1) parking is about $15. Not mind blowing, but you also need to pay to get into the actual museum.2) they have stands set up in the park to take cashless payments (so mobile, debit/credit etc). I had a discount which was cool but honestly, you could have just walked the grounds and not paid. The museum really wasn’t all “that.” A big portion of it was closed off. You could actually go above it on the grounds and peer in, but it seems like most of the interesting stuff was in there.3) the grounds are open to the public. In addition to tourists, you see people walking their dogs around, picnicking and all. I’d probably have preferred to just do that.4) we didn’t see much of the bubbling tar pits, it was pretty dormant. But it was still cool to see, regardless.I’m happy we went, but I’ll opt to just walk around next time. It was a piece of history I’m happy to view for myself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tcooper22
30,Not mind blown :),"Active tar pits, and well interesting but not something that would really blow your mind. Probably because its in the middle of the most Urban area ever :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Umayrmasud
50,Worth a visit!,"Cool for kids and adults alike. We visited on a short trip to Los Angeles. I wanted to show my 11-year old son more than just the hollywood side of LA, and he counts this stop as one of the highlights of the trip... same goes for my husband and I.Nice combination of outdoor pits and a cool, interactive museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MuhGee
50,Totally unbelievable,"Loved seeing the tar pits, fossils and history of how the museum was established. Seeing this very unusual natural phenomenon in the middle of an urban setting is unforgettable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bluenose934
30,Interesting but not exceptional,"This was an unusual museum in that we’ve never been to an actual site of fossil discovery. However the displays were just displays. Little information was given and the museum was not really interactive. The area with the large mammoth reproduction was completely fenced off and I have never read any review or seen any pics of that, so this must have been done recently. The park is open to anyone and all the “pits” are accessible for viewing. The museum houses the actual fossils so if you’ve already seen some, just save yourself the entry fee and enjoy the park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yazdragonfly
50,Interesting place,"My family and I spent 1.5 hrs inside with 1 movie (2 were offered). This is an I interesting place to see while in LA. With an 8 year old and 15 year old, we spent 1.5 hours inside, including a 3D show. There is one other show, but we decided to just do one.We also walked around outside, where you can see tarpits and some people at work, doing something with the finds. There were a couple areas on the grass, not behind fences, where tar was starting to come up, so watch where your kids walk or run around—it’s very sticky. There are also a couple statues of extinct animals that the kids liked.There was also another building that you could go into to walk around and look at some bones that are still encased in the tar, so don’t remove your wristband right when you exit the main building. We spend around 45 minutes in the outside area (would be less without kids).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Traveling91012
50,Such a great educational space for kids & adults,"We had a very happy couple of hours here. It was fascinating looking at the tar pits as they bubble away, and seeing the fossils that have been extracted from them. The displays inside the museum are interactive demonstrating what it would be like to get trapped in tar, as well as bringing to life the animals whose bones have been found in the pits - we both learned so much. It is such a great educational space for kids and adults. Go see for yourself!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/an-old-pup
50,Educational for anyone,"I really loved going here on my resent trip to L.A. from where I was staying it was a bit of a drive but was well worth it. I love the guided tours,3d movies and so much more. I suggest the 3d movie first if you have never been before. Staff was helpful and knowledgeable on the subject matter of the tar pits its history and even some of the animal skeletons they had there as well. Recommended for all ages and great for groups or solo day out!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jamiesadventures86
40,Fascinating Museum and area,The tar pits are still there and you can see them on the grounds. Best thing is the museum where they have literally thousands of well preserved and cleaned fossils and actual bones of ancient animals. The museum is not to be missed as you can see the scientists working on the findings from the tar pit. It is a good location near other museums and there are nearby places to eat.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/love2skiLosAngeles
50,Unique experience,"I have never seen “Ice Age”, dinosaur movies or anything (nor Games of Thrones), but we happened to pass by and decided to visit.What a great experience!As a tourist from far away one would never imagine such a place close to all the tourist attractions on LA.It was so interesting and informative, we are still studying the books we bought! It is also a very peaceful place with plenty of green areas, next to the tar (asphalt) pits.We went into the museum, which was also very impressive - you can actually observe people working on all the finds. There is a guided tour outside, but unfortunately our guide was extremely bad and spent most of her time, explaining how funny she was (not!).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carate
50,Very facinating place,"Just walked around the pits and read the information placques, So facinating seeing the pits that are still bubbling where the prehistoric creatures were trapped.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dennancy
40,Interesting quick stop,"We were actually on our way to LACMA, but from our parking area we were able to walk by the Tar Pits and look in. Not a whole lot to see, as others have said, but it was really wild to see this gigantic puddle of tar that is still bubbling, and to think about how this goes back to the dinosaur age. It's worth a quick few minutes if you are already in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/worleybird98
40,Great for kids,"Went with my grandchildren aged 12, 10 and 5 and they all really enjoyed it.Will definitely kill a few hours if you are trying to amuse children . Onsaying that all the adults in our party enjoyed it also.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Marygirl2014
50,Weird and wonderful,"I had wanted to see this for a long time. The pits are something you really have to see (and smell) to understand. I did not expect to see asphalt coming up out of the ground in the middle of the grassy area around the museum!! The museum is small but quite good, better than expected.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dcm7r
50,AMAZING PLACE!,The actual PIT is fenced off for safety but can be seen without paying to enter the museum. The TAR SMELL is incredible - I thought it would be a slight odor but it's very distinct! Not terribly overpowering though. The museum is impressive and has several hands-on type demonstrations. Super impressive!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lad0206

40,A Gem in the Middle of LA,This is a park and a natural history museum created from preserved remains of wildlife that live in ice age LA. It's fascinating. Scientists continue to excavate the tar pits that reveal a very different landscape. You can view several to the tar pits and excavation sites as well as tour the wonderful museum. I would recommend this attraction to all ages.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CaliforniaCricket
40,Unique!,"We visited la brea the day before easter, not crowded, very pleasant. We'd been years ago but enjoyed our second visit too. The museum was very interesting; hard to believe the sheer number and diversity of extinct creatures found in the pits here. Outside, the park grounds were lovely. Of course we remembered the bubbling lake, but the pits still being excavated were new to us as were the big crates of tar waiting to be studied (taken from a site nearby where a parking lot was being built).If you buy your tickets online, you save $2 each. We paid the $15 parking fee and left our car there most of the day while we walked down the street to the Peterson auto museum. As we walked by the parking meters, we realized they said free holiday parking and there were empty spaces!! Oh well. You could also visit the big art museum next door.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eldoradogirl
50,Mammoths and Mastodons!,On our last visit we saw the traveling exhibit Mammoths and Mastodons! It’s a small but really nice museum with a large number of prehistoric mammal and bird fossils! The grounds are nice too and you can see where fossils are actually found!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/4stevemandy
40,It's interesting just to walk around outside for free,"I didn't realize until someone told me that you don't have to go into the museum and pay admission to see the tar pits. We just walked around outside on a beautiful day and saw the bubbling tar and read the informative signs telling about the science behind the tar pits. A fun quick side trip on our vacation. It should not shock anyone when I say that they do smell HORRIBLE and you can smell it from, like, blocks away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fastrada
40,Just Plain Tarred,"This is a fun place for family and kids. It is more of a park. Lots of green grace amongst the pits of tar. Tar pits are not much to look at, but are a geological phenomenon. The products of the pits can be found in the wonderful museum with many of the prehistoric skeletons that were uprooted from the pits and assembled for display. There is some work still in progress as scientists explore the constant birth of new specimens from the tar. A good and unique experience to teach the kids about a long-gone age and its inhabitants.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/987barrys
50,Wonderful glimpse of prehistory !,"You can walk around the park outside and look at the fenced-off tar pits, which really aren’t that interesting. The interesting part is in the museum where you can see the paleontologists working on the excavated bones and the reconstructed skeletons of the animals which were trapped in the pits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dware82320
40,Unique place to visit,"You will only need an hour to enjoy the museum, short film, and the pits ... but it's worth that time if you have it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mgmcpa
40,Fun & Educational Museum,"I came here with my daughter’s family from Washington State that included my 6 year old grandson who just loves prehistoric animals. I had been here many years ago when my children were young. I thought it had greatly improved. We made a special day trip to visit the museum.My grandson was thrilled and especially enjoyed the Mammoth exhibits. They have several hands-on exhibits which is excellent and my grandson especially enjoyed.They have a live action show that the kids love. Also they have a very nice movie.You can view through large glass windows an actual paleontology lab as they continue with their research.The outdoor area is also worth seeing including the large tar pit area. You do not have to pay to see this display.The museum store is also very nice and has a great collection of souvenirs, books, prehistoric toys, prehistoric stuffed animals, prehistoric and Ice Age pictures and posters. My grandson was very happy and brought home some nice memories.They only negative is I thought the parking was pricey. I thought the museum itself was priced appropriate. Suggest you come early as I suspect the parking could get filled during peak hours. I did not explore about alternate parking.This is fascinating to see what prehistoric life was here in southern California. We are fortunate to have this museum and and young children and adults alike will enjoy and learn.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DavidMurrieta
50,LOVE LOVE LOVE this place,"I think this was the highlight of our trip to LA. While the Tar Pits are not huge, they are so interesting and the museum was amazing. The grounds are great, with lots of open space for little ones to run around. The bones and the information in the museum were so fun to see and to learn about. I would highly recommend visiting this unusual exhibit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/374barbh
50,La Brea Tarpits Museum!!!,We visited the La Brea Tar Pits Museum and were amazed. Our teen boys were capitivated and entertained. Like wise were we! The Skeletons and Stories were so s entertainining. The number of bonesdiscovered in the Pits were overwhelming. And the tragic stories of how they got there were so sad! This Museum amd the Movie are so interesting we will be Back !! I recommend it for all ages. Great story of our History.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MikeMackey
50,Fascinating Visit,"This was an unexpectedly interesting add-on to our day in Los Angeles that our family really enjoyed, Who knew that such creatures once roamed the area and got trapped in these tar pits! You can see quite a bit at this park without paying anything, so if you want, save your money and tour the outside exhibits only. Inside the museum are many interesting bone exhibits and a garden area that we enjoyed as well (admission required).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmericanexpatKL
30,La Brea Tar Pits,We thought this would attract more people but we were there on a Sunday morning and we were the only ones there. Very interesting to see the bubbles still coming up through the water for the gas.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/grueninger_karen
30,It’s alright,It was kind of cool to see the tar pits but after that it’s more geared towards younger kids. My teenagers (16 and 17) were bored. We were in and out in about 30 minutes.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jamrick75
40,Very Good multi-generational Visit,"We took our kids and grandkids to this museum and it does not disappoint. I really suggest that you watch the 2 15-minute movies about the Tar Pits and their excavation. We aged from 4 to 78, and there was something for all of us! The docents, or teachers, were so willing to share with the young children. Lots for them to do. And we loved walking around outside and seeing all the really well-done displays. And this is an on-going archeological site, so there may be more to come.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lncclc
50,"Fabulous and fascinating! An L.A. ""must""!","This is the largest collection of prehistoric fossils in the world, and they are still digging up more! Mammoths, sabre-tooth tigers, dire wolves, etc. -- they have many complete skeletons on display of these extinct species. Be sure to take the free 45-minute tour. It is VERY informative. Go on a nice day, as mush of the tour is outdoors (where the fossils have been found).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NancyBG
50,Get a tour,"La Brea tar pits is fun and unique, but it wont take long to see it all. Make sure you get a tour so you can get an idea of what is really going on inside the pits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/343eddiew
40,Cool park and educational experience,"The tar pits offer an opportunity to for kids and adults to explore extinct animals that they may never have seen before. The museum has area to do hands on tasks to teach you about what happened at the tar pits and how these animals are preserved today. There are opportunities to watch paleontologists work in the laboratory and in the excavation units. The gift shop is also worth a browse, they have some great things!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Buffalogirl41
40,Dinosaurs station,"Brilliant to see the tar pits and the estimates of the hordes that are in them, the exhibits also give a unique experience. a must see during any visit to LA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shoiz110
50,Very interesting!,"My perception of the tar pit museum prior to visiting was skeptical but my husband really wanted to go...so glad he did! This is a working archaeological dig and a well-done science museum about the animals who were fossilized in the pits. Our total visit, including the pits and the museum, was about 2 hours. Glad we went. Interesting stuff!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jodi307
40,Best thing is Tour,"Don't bother with the Ice Age movie. I think I saw the same one in the 70s. But, not knowing we left the 2nd stop of a great tour to see it. Tip. you xan join tour outside and save adnission fee.And you can see all the outdoor dig sites for free. The park area, also free with picnic benches is also beautiful. If you've been to 1 major natural history museum nothing really unique in this one.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Q4813BIangelag
50,"Creature from the Black Lagoon, LA Brea Tar Pits : fantastic day out","Love LACMA museum, and right next to it is The La Brea Tar Pits, which is really well laid out and great for everyone, and with the 'actual' tar pit !! right there can imagine you are 2000 BC",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/214suzanc
40,Interesting,I never knew that north America had Mamouths and camels. The story of the tar pits is very interesting and the one being excavated was a sight to see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/904-424-3593
50,Can't believe this is in the middle of the city!,"Was truly amazed, by the exhibits, the information, and the place itself. Really enjoyed seeing the actual tar pits - phenomenal. Go take a look, it's well worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KiwiStaces
40,Interesting,"The Museum was informative, but we learned more on the tour. Our tour guide, Bailey was great. She handled a big group and answered all our questions patiently. The 3D movie was just OK (small theater and plastic chairs). We chose not to do the Encounters since our kids are a bit older.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/difish
40,LA's First Attraction,"Check the LA Bucket List with a fascinating journey to prehistoric times of incredible beasts at this park and museum. Natural asphalt and methane still bubble up from the Earth's crust here, and there is constant new discoveries of Ice Age fossils. This park has the George C. Page Museum on site, with the fossils of Mammoths, Mastadons, Antique Bison, Giant Ground Sloths, American Camels, Dire Wolves, Short Face Bears, American Lions and the famous Sabre Tooth Cat. The Museum offers different price packages, but the general admission is still the best value. There is additional costs of a 3D movie ""Titans of the Ice Age"" and a ""Ice Age Encounters"" show where a life size puppet of a sabre cat interacts with the audience. (My opinion is to skip these, which we did.)The museum also features life size replicas of various beasts. The scariest of which is the 16 foot tall Short Face Bear. (Glad that's extinct!) There are various displays of creature fossils throughout the halls, and a stylish/artful wall of 400 Dire Wolf skulls. There is a small gift shop and restrooms inside as well. A nice, zen-like surprise was the central atrium in the museum. Outside of the museum, the park has trails to ongoing digs and fossil recovery pits. The Observation Pit was fascinating, with its ""fossil gumbo"". There is also the picturesque ""Lake Pit"" with the iconic struggling Mammoth, stuck in the tar. The Lake Pit will also surprise you with sudden bursts of bubbles of methane.We brought a picnic lunch. There are outdoor restrooms and a small group of picnic benches. We opted to literally sit on top of the museum, overlooking the park, while we tried to wrap our heads around the fact that this area was teaming with titanic and frightening creatures. It's mind blowing.Parking is $15 for all day 9:30 a.m. to 10:00 p.m., and will fill up by 11:00 a.m. on weekends and holidays. There is no food sold here, other than vending machines near the restrooms. Not to worry, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art is next to the park which has a restaurant and bar, and across the street is a location that offers various food trucks, parked on Wilshire Boulevard, in front of a public display of segments from the Berlin Wall.Around the Museum of Art are two public art displays, ""Urban Light"" and ""Levitated Mass"". Make sure to visit these as well. All of these extra attractions are within walking distance of the La Brea Tar Pits. A little further down Wilshire is the Petersen Automotive Museum, and a mile to the north is the famous LA Farmer's Market and The Grove shopping mall.You can spend a couple of hours or the whole day in this area, depending on your agenda.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TSharkHB
40,An LA staple,"We didn't go inside the museum, we just walked around the outside to all the tarpits which is free (museum costs money). Its interesting to see these tar pits in the middle of a city. Makes me think of the movie Volcano. Its a great little walk and a place kids can enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JessiAnn85
40,LA Tarpits,"We vistied at a weekend, was very busy. Staff manged the line and crowds of people professionaly and friendly.Found the museum very interesting and lots to explore and learn about. Would defiently return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lolar773
30,You don’t need to go into the museum,"The museum was ok but outside there’s a park with all the tar pits to walk around for free. I think that was as cool as anything in the museum. If you don’t mind not seeing some of the fossils they’ve dug out, then save your money and just tour the park, which is dog friendly by the way. The smell of the tar and seeing the latest excavation spots make for a very interesting experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/redasumter
50,A can't miss Stop!,"So many people have not heard of the Tar Pits. Johnny Carson would mention them occasionally, so when I made my first ever trip to Los Angeles, I had to go. I'm so glad that I did! My husband and I took a 20 minute Uber drive from downtown LA to the museum. So glad we did! So very interesting to see still live tar pits and all of the presently constructed fossils in the museum. Really? There were 2,000 lb. giant sloths in California and Kentucky? Wow!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PattyW002
50,Definitely worth the trip,"I’ve heard about this spot forever and finally got a chance to see it in person. The museum has fantastic displays and does a great job explaining how the tar pits were formed, why/how the animals died and the procedures for excavating the sites. There are hands-on displays as well as movies to watch. After you leave the museum you get to follow a path around the area. This path takes you through active excavation sites as well as fenced off areas Protecting visitors from at that’s bubbling up from the ground. You can actually see the gas bubbling up from the tar. Parking is very reasonable with a huge lot next door to the museum. The fee was $15 for the day. A short walk from this location and you’ll be at the Urban Lights and the Petersen Auto Museum. All in all a wonderful place to visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/621BillK
40,"Tar and Ice, Mammoths and Mastodons!","I’ve wanted to see the La Brea Tar Pits since before I moved to LA three years ago. Why it took me so long, I’m not really sure. Regardless, when the opportunity arose to see it with two of my best friends, I rejoiced.We pulled into the museum parking lot, which costs $15 per vehicle. From there, we walked to a nearby (outdoor) ticket booth where we learned that General Admission for the museum is (again) $15, while the tar pits themselves are free to explore.Knowing we had a few hours before the gallery closed at 5pm, we decided to visit the outdoor exhibits first. These consisted of prehistoric mammal statues and an active fossil site, as well as the aforementioned tar pits, which are fenced off to the public as a safeguard.It was beyond fascinating walking among such a hazardous material, which contributed to the fossilization of thousands of prehistoric beasts.I strongly suggest continuing all the way through to end of the path where an Observation Pit is located. The “Pit” is home to a tar-saturated fossil site display which features several remnants of ancient animals (including a mastodon skull) and is included in the price of admission to the museum, so purchasing tickets beforehand is highly recommended.From there we walked a winding path through an open field to the museum entrance. Upon entry we bypassed the ticket office and turned left where a mural stood welcoming us to their mainstay Ice Age exhibit.Exploring the gallery, we were captivated by the many (near-complete) mammal fossils, including both mammoths and mastodons — yes, these two are different — saber-toothed tigers, dire wolves, Yesterday’s camels, ancient bison and ground sloths.We would come across an abundance of interactive activities (mainly for children), including one that demonstrated the sheer density of the dark brown liquid.Making our way to the Fossil Lab, we were enthralled watching actual paleontologists examine recently discovered fossil remains.Next we would venture “outside” to the conservatory, which is home to a wealth of flora. A koi pond previously resided here as well.We ended our educational experience at the gift shop (because, where else?) and after moseying around for a few minutes, we made our exit. I would recommend this attraction to anyone looking for a little something different from the glitz and glamour that is Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelKassel
40,Good half day visit,Try to time your visit for the 11.30am Project 23 Revealed & then the 12 noon Excavator tour to get the most out of your visit. The 2 tours are repeated again later in the day. Then visit pit 91 & the Observation Pit.The staff & guides are very informative & make the difference.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carlton3
50,Nice museum,Buy the ticket for the museum and shows. Or just Visit the outdoor oily pits if in a hurry. Facility is nice. Parking expensive for a park.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/donh941
50,Interesting and unexpected,Been to LA many times but never visited La Brea museum. It was amazing just to think of how many fossils are hidden underground in the tar. The expo in the museum itself is versatile and very hands on for children and adults.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ewatte
40,Outdoors FREE,"Outdoors info, signs and more. parklike setting. free parking on one side of the street, meter parking the other side. Free brochures during regular hours. plus add the sculptures and Berlin Wall from Lacma with your visit. meutermedia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MeuterMedia
40,Don't buy a ticket if you only want to see the pits,"I had a great time at the tar pits and it was fascinating. There were lots of school groups (but I also saw school groups going into other museums so maybe I was just there on field trip day!). As the museum is quite small all the groups made it feel very crowded. The exhibits are fascinating and the staff lovely. However most of the pits are outside and are free to wander around. The ticket price gets you into the museum the observation pit, everything else is open to everyone. If you aren't that bothered by seeing the museum I'd recommend skipping it and just wandering around outside",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NinaH932
50,Great afternoon outing!,Very well done museum. Attended tour and 3D movie. Highly recommend both. 2-3 hours is enough time for all. Parking seemed a little expensive but found street parking nearby.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lkyman
30,Just did the outside,"We didnt pay for the museum so I can't speak to that value. We walked up and a tour was finishing but nothing that the guide said was anything that wasn't on the signs around. I'm not sure if the tours and museum engage people more. It was a sunny day and we chose to sit down and look at the pits for 20 minutes, resting our feet, before continuing on our walk up the museum mile. On a rainy day we might have paid the admission fee to learn more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GrnMtnGirl79
40,Interesting place.,"Museum is not very big, but good enough size. Very educational for kids and adults that's interested in learning about the tar pits and fossils. It's actually located where currently tar is still oozing out of the ground very slowly. Come, learn and check it out yourself. You won't regret it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/380bella
40,"Educational, well-priced","Worth the price. Great deal, lots of educational exhibits for kids to learn about the animals. I thought there would be more digging and active parts outdoors, but there was an observation area inside where you could see the scientists cleaning and sorting and preserving the fossils, so that was the current scientific process that you could see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/laurarD4382EE
40,Engaging,Three D movie was great. The kids loved it. We all learned so much about the mammals and the effect of global warming on the Ice Age. Many interactive things for the kids. Interesting facts about the tar pits and the continued research. Loved the fish bowl and watching the researchers work.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/897SusanF
40,Fun museum with hands-on activities (the outdoor tar pits themselves are a bit disappointing),A very interesting museum with loads of hands-on activities for kids. It presents the local history contained in the tar pits in a way that is accessible to both children and adults. The history itself is fascinating and it was awesome to be right in the spot where it happened.There is not a restaurant on site but there's a gift shop. Gift shop items are at museum prices.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michelskt
50,A historic place to watch coal tar pitd,A remarkable place to visit a site of geological find right in LoS Angeles. In these tar pits creatures like Sabre tooth tigers were excavated. These tar pits are over 25000 yrs. it is a time capsule of our geological history,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Srak91
40,Fun Time,Took my boys here. Last time I was here was in elementary school. Some things have changed since then. A must experience as a child.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Trizzzy
50,INCREDIBLE HISTORY,A MAGNIFICENT outdoor and indoor history of the time of the mammoths and other stone age denizens. Wonderful for both all ages - 5 to 90. Watching the outside bubbling tar pits takes you back to the time of these animals and their lives become real.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/607sandy
40,Loved the La Brea Tar Pits and Museum.,I was traveling with my 23 and 25 year old daughters. The exhibits were informative and interesting. A surprise in the middle of a major city. Loved the movie. Museum was just the right size to keep the attention space and not feel overwhelmed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ellensvacation
40,Bubbling sulfur,This location between major thoroughfares in LA has a modest museum but the bubbling tar pits are the real attraction. Some things don’t change.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fishingchic
50,Very interesting place that you would not expect in the city,"The museum and the tar pits outside are very interesting. They have so many specimen of fossils from the Ice Age. And you can still see the tar bubbling in some places, that is really cool. In the museum you can see the researchers looking for even tiniest pieces of fossils from a small pile of dirt and rocks. Very interesting to watch and see how these findings are done. It was really worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travellingal10
40,"Museum is excellent, the tar pits are disappointing.",Parking for the La Brea Tar Pits and Museum is challenging. We ended up at LACMA but that allowed us to walk through the gardens to the Museum. The exhibits are very well done and convey the history of the area and the excavations. The Lake Pit is the only one remaining that offers a real look at what the tar pits were like. Spend your time inside the Museum.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alleng51
40,Smaller than I'd hoped...,"The museum had very interesting specimens, films, and real scientists at work. Unfortunately it was too rainy to get to see everything offered... The atrium was closed, the outdoor tar pits where you were supposed to see work being done were closed, and every pit was flooded with water and impossible to see. I wish there were more to do in the museum. With that being said, it was still very informative and interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/578anniek
40,Good outdoor activity,"If you are a child of the 70s and remember the Flintstones, this is a great place to stop. You get to see some of the animals shown on the show. Worth a couple of hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kdbauder
40,Fun Day Trip for Families,"This is a good place to go with the family, especially with kids. It's cool to imagine the area as it was millions of years ago, and awesome to see the fossils and bones of creatures that are long extinct.I was a tad disheartened at the state of some of the pits. Some of them were quite covered in leaves and a couple were so small that you could barely tell they were there. Granted, I'm not sure anything could actually be done about this since these are natural phenomena and have been around for so long as is. It is awesome to see nevertheless, and we enjoyed taking a peek at the sites that are still being excavated.The 3D theater also leaves a bit to be desired. The seats were not very comfortable and the floor was flat, making it feel less like a theater and almost like a classroom. The content that was played was interesting though! Overall would recommend this as a fun outing if you haven't visited yet.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aleenaluisier
10,Drained of life,"In a city like Los Angeles, packed with some of the finest creatives on the planet, production people and designers, it is incredible the La Brea Tar Pits is such a sad experience. It’s appears to be unchanged since 1974. Dusty display cabinets, laughably miserable statues and there is truly the oddest slow motion animatronic of a cat attacking a ground sloth; a scene that is utterly drained of life.Sure there is a 3D cinema but this is a seriously disappointing experience. After years of driving past L.A. Brea Tar Pits curious as to what discoveries they hold, I wish we had kept driving.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrsWaterhouse
40,Unique Natural History,"There are various tar pits on the beautiful grounds. Also, a visitor can see exploratory work in progress. The museum is very large and nicely done. The fossils of creatures trapped in the tar pits provide a history of animals from periods tens of thousands of years ago. There is also the modern history of the tar pits. It is a must see. Kids would really enjoy it. The LA County Museum of Art is adjacent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AZ1912

40,La Brea Tar Pits,"After a visit to the Petersen Car Museum, we went for a walk along Wiltshire Boulevard and came across Le Brea Tar Pits, the name attracted me. The outside area is free, the Museum has a charge. As it was late we just did the free part. Next time in LA will did finitely do the museum.The bubble tar pits are amazing. Worth a visit if you are in the area. It was an unexpected gem in the city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/motorcar1
50,So much more than I imagined,"I was travelling with my adult son enjoying the beaches and LA. I wanted to go see the tar pit but I thought that it would just be a quick look because it wouldn't be all that much to see. Well, I was wrong. The main tar lake is what I have seen photos of over the years but that is only part of what is going on. They have one tar lake that was actually bubbling while we were there and lots of smaller tar pits and they even have tar coming out of the ground all over the beautiful grounds. They have educational plaques and demos going on too. We saw so much outside that we didn't even go into the museum. It's so cool when something is so much better than you imagined.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NMM1776
50,Great Place,Very interesting place. Friendly people and the movie was good. Glad to see them trying to conserve history.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/locohog
50,Another very unique place,"The La Brea Tar Pits is quite an interesting place, right in the heart of the city. It is not very big. There are indoor and outdoor exhibits, and the outdoor exhibits are free. It is not just a place for paleontologists, but for everyone who is interested in knowing about the tar pits and the animals who used to live and thrive in an area now totally changed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OrchestraConductor
40,A Must See,this is amazing to see a lot of history here it was cool to just to see that billions of years have gone by yet they are still finding fossils here. The active tar pit was just amazing to watch the tar bubble,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mikek686
40,Historic Spot,"We finally made it to the La Brea Tar Pits and quite enjoyed ourselves. I'm not much of a natural history buff but I enjoyed wandering the grounds to see the pits and see the current excavation site. It was so neat to see some of them still bubbling!For someone like me, I might recommend that you visit the museum first (definitely watch those who are working on the fossils live), and then wander the grounds.I would have loved to brought a blanket and a book and spent the whole afternoon on the grounds. Beautifully kept parks are one of my favorite things. Maybe its because I miss wide open green spaces and you don't get them as often in the concrete jungle",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tink8009
50,Historic,We didn’t go into to the museum because we were short on time but we did walk around and view the pits. It was a nice experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J_Terhune
40,Lots of fossils,"We visited the La Brea Tar Pits and Museum this week. It is a place to take children. The tar pits and the work being actively done are both fascinating. I doubt I will return anytime soon, but it is worth a one time visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/63breton
50,Kids loved it,This was a great way to explore the prehistoric past of the region and interesting to learn about the tar pits and fossils. Amazing that the tar pits are still there too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/447harrietw
20,"Warning, this is strictly a kids place!","If you've got small children, go for it! If you don't, go somewhere else! The museum itself is very small with very few exhibits. What it does have is hundreds of screaming children. Clearly there's nothing for the children to do, so they get bored and run around screaming. I do not recommend this place for adults!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GenghisKhan
50,Cool place!,"We were fascinated that these tar pits are right in the middle of LA and still bubbling from the ground. The museum with the fossils that were pulled from the pit was very interesting. Also, the grounds were beautiful around the pits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/473barbaral
50,Excellent tour for the family,Walking through the grounds is free. Pay to see the museum and take a guided tour. The guided tour was well worth it. Very knowledgeable staff walked our group along each outside stop (each pit) and was engaging with information about both technical aspects as well as debunking myths and pop culture misunderstandings about the tar pits. Great for kids. Tour takes 30-40 mins.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rlj714
50,Great place!,My wife and my parents visited the Tar Pits and Museum and had a great time! We enjoyed the museum. It had great exhibits and demonstrations. To see the actual working lab was a great experience. To walk through the areas where the tar pits are is a great experience and fun for the whole family! We highly recommend it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Q3351ZBleeg
30,Keep your expectations in check,"I’ve wanted to visit this place since I was a kid. The main attraction of this place is the big tar pit, but you quickly find out all of the real tar has been removed from it and it’s mostly just a fake pit of water and some chemicals to make the bubbles.IMPORTANT: you can walk the grounds of this place and see some small pits and a new dig site for free. The museum itself costs $15. It’s super small, takes about 10-15 minutes to see everything, and mostly just shows fossils that have been dug up there. I would have paid 15 for the whole thing, but I didn’t think 15 for the museum alone was good value for money. If you’re on a budget or frugal, keep this in mind.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karimh839
50,The place where the villain in Last Action Hero Blew Up!,"I know, I know... it is not as scientiffically cool as the idea of all these old fossils being dug up in this natural pool of Tar in the Middle of this massive city of Los Angeles. Still... that one moment in the movie Last Action Hero when the bomb goes off and the big bubble happens is all I can think about everytime I come here. The Tar Pits are an LA classic and everyone should pay a visit to the museum too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/captain_nomad
50,Perfect afternoon,We had a great time at the museum. Our kids learned so much about the area and what happened to the animals and plants living there. It was amazing to see the amount of fossils found in such a small area. The museum and surrounding area is very well done.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luvmykids2
50,La Brea Tar Pits,Tar PitsThis is a beautiful museum in Los Angeles witch is recommend it to visit; you can walk around and watch in real time the tar bubbling and just to see how this magnificents animals used to lived in that era. And the museum has a lot to see and explain how they found and still recovering mammals bones.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sokey71
50,Very Interesting and Educational Museum,The museum was chalked full of amazing things. It was extremely educational. I was amazed how many animals lived right here in the United States at one time. I recommend seeing the 3 D movie too. Everything was clean inside and out as well. This is a great place to see for young and old a like.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KimGregOhio
50,I'm stuck on this place!,We have been to the tar pits many times it is so interesting! if you have time take in the little shows they are good. BONUS...tar bubbles up through out the grounds some times you can poke it with a stick...no trash please!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lorihas2
30,entertaining history lesson,I have been here several times in my lifetime. I find it interesting. my 16 year old daughter asked to go this time because her friend that was with us had never been. I still like going there even as an adult be unless something new and special is discovered that will probably be the last time for me. if you haven't been its worth the visit,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hdmarc1956
50,So Cool!!,I would say that anyone with a child interested in dinosaurs would love if their parents would bring them here. We had a great time with our son.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/759vincenta
50,Quick Tar pit visit - free to walk around grounds,"Visited with a friend, we both grew up in LA and this was my first time here after having moved away out of state. There is a museum, but we were short on time and did not go to the museum. We walked around the grounds, saw some of the pits, pretty cool and amazing stuff. Walking around the grounds is free (did not know that) admission is for the museum and the exhibits. Would definitely come back again on another visit to town!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tganuza
20,Save your money,"If you just want to wander the grounds to see the tar pits...do that. DO NOT buy the ticket for the ""museum""...not worth it! It was pretty pricey to go into this tiny little building with not really that much to see. I'd go see it once if you're in the neighborhood and have NOTHING better to do...just to say you saw it...but really, for me...this is one you could afford to SKIP.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BonnieK470
50,Great place to visit!!,We visited this place with our kids ds and grandkids and thought is was amazing! Very interesting and educational!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TraycieB
50,Excellent Museum,The explanation by the guides was excellent. I never knew such a place could exist in an urban environment. The richness of history here is amazing being the only worldwide active excavation site in the world. The movie introduction is a must see event. But also take the guided tour of the excavation site to ask questions about what was found and is now being found on a daily basis. A great place for families.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/448bobc
40,Great history lesson,"very interesting museum, learned some more about the dinosaurs that were in the are before we were. lots of displays skeletons etc..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/charleswR2925PA
50,Fun and Educational Museum,"You have seen the Tar Pits in movies and maybe have read about them, but visiting them, and seeing the fossils they have found is fascinating. This was arguably the highlight of our family trip to LA over Christmas week. The Tar Pits appeals to kids and adults of all ages and is the perfect mixture of educational (wonderful visitors center and tours) and fun (plenty of space to run around outside or roll down the museum's hill.We got there shortly after it opened and were able to get in without having to wait on line (a line developed as the morning went on). We started by watching the 3-D movie on the ice age (an extra $5 pp). It was really well done and started us off with some basic knowledge of the area and the types of animals that have been found in the Tar Pits. We then wandered the museum, checked out the grounds, and finished with the (included) excavator tour of the outside grounds. We spent about 3 or 4 hours at the park, saw everything we wanted to see and left feeling that we had learned alot!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dctravel
50,Loved it!,Hubby had this on his bucket list for a long time and didn't disappoint! The tour is worth because you learn so much and we thought Tony our guide this past Saturday was very entertaining and we learned a lot.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SORork
50,Make this a priority for your LA visit,"This museum is the place to find out what existed in the region prior to human inhabitation. And it was really, really crowded! There were all kinds of animals, some cute and cuddly, others all tooth and claw. And I really mean CLAW! Hollywood may make scary movies, but down here there is evidence that staying alive in LA back then was a real challenge. Some of those tigers have to be seen to be believed. But you will not want to see them any other way than dead and preserved.For some strange reason this museum is not well known in CA, and not amongst tourists either. But it is a gem. You even get to join in the fossil hunting!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/367john
50,Definitely worth it!,"It seems that a lot of the reviews ponder the question of whether this museum is worth the admission. I say definitely yes!Great dinosaur-bone-like exhibits (actually more mammoths and mastodons) and modern day animals. Fun to think about how these creatures looked walking down what is now Wilshire Blvd.If you have an imagination, these exhibits will take you back in time to when you can imagine being one of these creatures who is just minding your own business when you walk upon what appears to be a pool of water, but is actually a tar pit, in which your legs get stuck and you are now doomed. They have an exhibit with 400 skulls of the dire wolf breed. The exhibit explains how the dire wolf would see animals (prey) appearing to be stuck in the tar and be fair game for a meal. In pursuing their meal, the wolves themselves, then get stuck, mired in the same predicament as their prey. Doomed.They have a cool exhibit where they let you experience what it feels like to try to get yourself free from getting stuck in tar. Tar is thick and stubborn. I won’t give it away, but let’s just say that it helps you really feel for any creature who gets stuck in tar. The kids seemed to like this exhibit a lot.Once you’ve done the museum, then walk outside and see the free outdoor displays with the remaining, real tar pits. As you see the bubbling gas pits, remember the exhibit of what you would do if you or your legs got stuck in the tar. You’d be doomed!PS. The ($12) parking lot was full but we were able to get meter street parking fairly easily.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JanieC
40,Small but interesting museum,"Outside sections are free to access and the tar pits and current dig sites are interesting and the museum, whilst small, is fun and interactive. It neighbours onto art galleries so there’s plenty to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarahsS3416QX
50,An interesting gem!,Who thinks of going to Tar Pits? It turns out that it is a fascinating little museum and beautiful grounds. Wonderful history and interesting archeology. Absolutely worth a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Anastasia3052018
30,Interesting,Never got inside the museum which is free to LA residents AFTER 3pm! Parking $12. Can walk around and see the tar bubbling in the pits...great preview for Volcano the movie...nice spot for kids for sure...just OK otherwise...didn't seem very well kept...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PlatinumHoney
30,Took my Aunt who'd never been,"I was here years ago and the museum and observation pit were free. Came today to show my 76 yr old Aunt, who'd never been and didn't know about this place. Now they charge 20 bucks a person! To see everything. I was so disappointed. We would only pay that if we were going to be here all day.At least she got to see the tar pit outside, but no skeletons. I'll take her on the tour via YouTube and google, through the museum while we fly home.Too bad they charge everyone. I don't think I'll be back again. I know she won't",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TLynneWrites
40,Small but informative,Amazing exhibition of their finds in the tar pits. Volunteers are very knowledgeable and tell you a lot about the exhibit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NynkeV1
50,Interesting Quick Museum,"Indoor museum portion took 45 minutes, and the outdoor section took another 30 minutes. Great full sized skeletal remains recovered from the tar pits. Active dog site, so it’s cool to see them continue to unearth new specimens.Side note: We got there at 915 am when the parking lot opened, but probably could’ve parked on the street (and saved $15).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GreatestGatsby
50,Not to be missed La Brea Tar Pits and Museum.,A fascinating place to visit especially for families. The tour was very informative and the 3D Movie was great.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/815robyng
50,Grounds were delightful.,We had an hour before our next appointment and spent the time on the grounds. We enjoyed strolling and looking at the exhibits. I would recommend the grounds if you are in need of of a peaceful diversion.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/matchbookdoll

40,Fascinating!,"A visit to the La Brea Tar Pits is well worth it! It is a great venue for families and the young and old, alike. We experienced the 3-D Ice Age movie and the archaeological tour. Both are highly recommended as a great overview/understanding of the history and current practices. It’s easy to get to and the parking is convenient. Enjoy, we did!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/820richarda
40,Have Heard About It Since My Youth.,"It was an interesting tour with a knowledgeable and personable tour guide. I heard about it early in life, and now I got to see it. It has a nice, comfortable walking tour, and it takes your mind back to the Ice Age. The museum has great fossils. If time permits, it's a nice edition to your itinerary-especially if fossils appeal to you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/miamiredskin1968
50,Worth a Visit!,"As a Los Angeles native, I am embarrassed that it took me decades to finally visit this place. The museum is excellent, and the guided tours with museum educators are truly worthwhile. You’ll learn a great deal, and you’ll enjoy strolling through the park outside the museum. We spent a wonderful, long morning here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/324AnneG
50,Surprisingly Exciting!,"I normally don't like museums but this one is special. The tar (asphalt) pits and the museum are super interesting and everything is pretty nicely organized. The staff members were really helpful and friendly, and the free tours were informative and still casual enough for people to ask questions throughout. I loved the skeleton fossils on display and the open pit that you can observe with some fossils sticking out. This is a great place for children as well as adults, and the outdoor areas are perfect for picnics if you live nearby! I'll be recommending this place to all my friends who have some spare time in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nonfictionexpedition
40,"Outside free, museum had discounted senior admission","At first we were only going to look around outside at the park, the excavation dig and the one remaining, occasionally bubbling tar pit. Fascinating. Went to the museum in the end and it was really good. Lots of things from previous digs, a lot of information.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chinapjs
40,Worth a visit,"A walk within the pleasant grounds will allow you to see the main tar pit as well as a current dig and other items of interest. The museum has an entrance fee with discounts for seniors etc . Both grounds and museum are accessible for visitors with mobility problems. The museum houses some excellent displays as well as a two theatres , one being 3D . There is no cafe, however the restrooms were very clean when visited.This is the only active urban pit of its kind in the world and puts a very interesting and informative view on an historical site.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RichardT652
40,Great surprise in modern L A,"Recommended to go visit by hotel concierge - worth the visit. Amazing complete fossils on display, thousands of fossils, bones, all well preserved. You can watch an expert cleaning a bone which is 30 thousand years old. Live digs also open to view",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jimmysol
50,"Amazing day, fantastic tour!","We are over visiting from England and were excited to visit the tar pits being big fans of mammoths! Had an amazing day, looking round the museum, seeing where the fossils are studied and cleaned, learning more about the history and walking round to see the tar pits themselves. The highlight was definitely our tour though, our guide was Daniel who knew a huge amount and could answer our many questions. He really made our whole experience, thank you Daniel!! Would recommend this to anyone, such a unique place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emilyjuliets
40,A unique curiosity...,"You will actually see the ""tar pits"" the bones of the extinct mammoths that actually sank into the gooeyness and there died - thousands of years ago. It gives phenomenal perspective of what Los Angeles looked like before the last Ice Age. I don't know anything like it. And it can be done within an hours time - and can be reached by public transportation!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MediaByte
50,Awesome History,"It's hard to believe that this ancient site is in the middle of LA and adjacent to LACMA. Despite the smell (beware) I always enjoy looking at this bubbling black masses for free in the park adjacent to the museum and imagining the wooly mammoths, camels and bears that eons earlier had roamed here. Metered street parking is usually available and more reasonable than the underground lot adjacent to LACMA>",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlobalGypsy_13
50,Fascinating,So cool to see the iconic La Brea Tar Pits. The museum was very interesting. Incredible how many artefacts have been pulled from the ground here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sharonsea
50,Fascinating place for something totally different,"We were 2 adults and found the place fascinating with glooping tar still bubbling up in a lake in the grounds. The gardens are free but we paid for the museum which is great value and older kids will love it - who knew there were camels, bears & woolly mammoths living in LA! Hop in an Uber for a totally different LA experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Karribubbles
30,I like the past,It's nice a little short visit. We did the admission and 3k movie. It was okay I wish there was more substance but the walk outside is Kay just wish it was little cleaner. Good luck finding somewhere clean and not busy to eat within five miles of it. Homeless just everywhere and a real nusiance. Parking is not cheap and the museum is not that big under two hours and the walk outside to see other tar pits uneventful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/teamtruck619
50,School field trip,It's hard to believe that such natural and historic wonder sits in the middle of Los Angeles off the busiest streets.It's highly recommend for young and old. So much to see and learn about the area and the animals that roamed it more than 10000 years ago.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SaugusM
30,What a Really Cool History. Easy & simple to engage,Impressive history of the pits. Loved reading the history and seeing the current state of the pits. Great for little kids as it is outside and can let the kids run around without harm nor bothering other visitors. Very intersting. Glad we went.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Venture21613
40,Unusual interesting museum,Never knew about this museum but a friend suggested my grandchildren would be interested in it. We were all surprised at what there was in the middle of a city. Lots to see and learn about the discovery of the tar pits. Well worth a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LINDAmia
50,Very Interesting,I really enjoyed this museum. Good exhibits and you can actually then view the real tar pits. Right in the middle of the city too. Glad it didn't get paved over. If you enjoy history you will like this. good for kids too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/donmS7158RS
40,Fun and interesting stop,The La Brea Tar Pits is actually a very interesting and unique stop. You can actually watch the tar bubbling up on the surface here. It's in an area on Wilshire Blvd convenient to shopping and tourism.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/0221Serendipity
40,nice stop,went here on a Sunday morning. the museum was still closed but we walked around the area for free recommended stop of you are near great for kids,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/78gzaff
50,SURPRISE IN THE MIDDLE OF LA,"A most interesting place to visit for couples or family, quite a unexpected attraction and historical landmark and museum in the middle of Los Angeles.So many skeleton remains of mainly extinct animals and birds found here. All skeletons that are in the museum are original and found on site unlike some museums that bring them from other areas.They do not send them to other museums so this is the only place to see them naturally with their dark black/ brown colour from the Tar pits.Nearly all the tar pits are filled in after excavation apart from one or two that are fenced in to show the natural event.Allow around 90 minutes to 2 hours to walk around the park and look through the museum, if you want to pay extra to watch one or both the 3D movies also on site you would require a longer stay, but you would need to check show times.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/holiday2travel
50,La Brea Tar Pits and Museum,"This is a beautifully laid out place that was a nice surprise on Wiltshire Blvd. We visited on a friday and there were very few people there in the morning. We had bought our tickets online so had no trouble getting in to the two free shows. It is very reasonably priced, our tickets only cost US$20 each (discounted for over 60s!) The gardens feature an pond of tar that has been there for such a long time, where mammoths and sabre-toothed tigers perished. The museum telling the story is very interesting. The gardens are spacious and there are active digs working still recovering bones! The two movies Titans of the Ice Age in 3D and Ice Age Encounters are short but very good. The whole place is very clean and well organised. Only criticism is that there is no coffee shop inside, just a souvenir shop! However there are some restaurants further along the street! Being relatively close to the airport it's worth a visit if you have to wait a long time for your plane.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lynnwY3955RB
50,Unexpected Treasure,"After living in Los Angeles for many years and not going to the tar pits, I was determined to experience them when visiting recently. I was totally surprised at the enormity and variety of the displays! The grandkids loved it, too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pdinfl
40,Recommended,If you have some extra time when visiting Los Angeles I would recommend a visit here. It is really cool and if you have kids they will love it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/briandQ3255VQ
40,La Brea Tar Pits,Wow - tar pits in the middle of LA! Very neat. We went as a multi generation family and youngest to oldest found it fascinating. Loved the exhibits and how we saw a guy actually working a crate of tar. The pits were very active and you could see and hear actual gassy bubbles popping to the surface of the pits.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Page1977
40,worth a visit,"We paid to go into the museum and see the exhibits, but you can see the tar pits without having to pay, as it's a public park. It was interesting and the kids loved watching the activity from the main pit. There are a few areas in the park that have tar bubbling up too, and you can see it gets a little explosive from the tar on the trees and benches around. Lots of cool history and fossils inside. You can also pay for some movies, but we weren't interested. They also gave us a map of some local places to eat, which was helpful since we didn't really know what our options were in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MelanieOep
50,Very Unique Historical Place,This was my first time visiting this place. It was very nice. A unique part of LA history. It Combines history and science and there is a lot to see. From the tar pits to the museum to the bubbling pond. It is all cool if you like science.This is definitely a one of a kind place to visit. It is kind of expensive. It cost me $15 to park and another $20 to get into the place. One perk is that you can also visit the LACMA next door. It is a short walk from the tar pits and you have already paid for parking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Briman747
50,Family holiday,Fantastic and fascinating museum.Well worth a visit whilst in LA.It is amazing seeing the active tar pits in such a built up area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melissamcc3
50,Fabulous,"Our first time in LA and this was on our list as our children (now adults) had read about it, watched documentaries about it and generally loved it. And so do did when we came here. The free part can keep you interested for quite a while - it's a well laid out park with lots of things to see, smell(!) and read about. The paid museum is relatively small but well also laid out and very interesting and is worth the price of entry (which is not extravagant). All in all we are very pleased we spent some of our LA time here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gonefishingx
20,Really not enough to see for the money and very dated.,"Went with family including 16, 15 and 13 year old.Cost approx $65 or £50 to get in, and have to say it wasn’t worth it at all. Lasted less than an hour.The museum itself was very dated and clearly haven’t been updated since 1977 when the museum opened. For example one one display modern technology was represented by a computer the size of a wardrobe with a tape machine.Incidentally don’t pay for parking in the lot: there is 4 hours parking in the street which is loads cheaper. If you can spend 4 hours in the museum itself you’ve fallen asleep somewhere.Have look round the park by all means, but don’t waste your time and money on the museum itself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rutland_boy123
50,Fascinating!,"If you like fossils, dinosaurs, tar pits, etc., this is for you! When you first enter the grounds, you can smell and see the tar pits that have been bubbling and continues to bubble for hundreds of years. And, scientists continue to discover and unearth fossils from the grounds today. Inside the museum, you can see the scientists at work, still making discoveries. You can also see on display the millions of fossils discovered in the pits. There is a 3-D movie for viewing called Titans of the Ice Age. It discusses the Ice Age and the mammals that roamed the Earth during this time. There is also a souvenir shop. Great experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rossgool
50,A very unique thing to visit,You don't even have to go into the pay-to-visit museum to see many (free) active pits and recreated skeletons and animals.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AdventureTraveler113
50,Active Fossil Excavating right in the middle of LA!,"The Tar Pits are a great educational experience in LA. The museum focuses exclusively on the animals that roamed the LA basin 10-50 Thousand Years Ago. It was very cool to see the comparison of the area back then compared to the sprawling Metropolitan area that it is now. There are lots of cool skeletons and fossils inside that were found right under neath the museum, from what used to be Rancho La Brea. They also give a great history of the Hancock family that donated all the land and fossils to the city's museum. The inside is very cool and informative, but you MUST go outside and check out the ground where the active digs sites are. They're digging up bones daily! It's Fossil Nerd Heaven :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OGTracyW
30,A Classic,Not really a lot to do here but look at exhibits. I’d always wanted to see the pits. I was satisfied with them but was ready to go in less than 30 minutes.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NikeofNargothrond
50,Really well done!,"This is a small museum and there isn't a lot to see, but we have been here multiple times. I always refer out of town visitors to this place, because it's well done and super interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/theresaslimbay
50,Awesome museum,My 6 & 9 year old boys loved the La Brea Tarpits! They learned a lot while having fun! Definitely worth your time if you have kids!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/juliebeasley2018
50,Incredibly Interesting If You Love History,"We found our visit to the La Brea Tar Pits and Museum incredibly interesting. It's free to stroll around the extensive grounds, but going to the museum adds a lot to the experience and helps you understand what you're looking at. We loved the guided Excavator Tour that we went on; our excellent guide took us around the museum, showed us the amazing glass enclosed lab where we could view scientists removing debris from ancient animal bones, and took us around the property to show us an active dig site, as well as areas where asphalt was still oozing up from the ground and gas was bubbling up to the surface. Also got to view Project 23 where twenty-three huge containers of excavated materials are being processed and analyzed. Since LA is always changing with new buildings being constructed and changes being made to the Metro line, bones and fossils are still being discovered today. We paid for the 3D movie, Titans of the Ice Age, and thought it was worth seeing; if you can do that when you first arrive, it really helps set the stage for everything you're going to encounter. Our favorite exhibit was the backlit display of hundreds of dire wolf skulls that have been excavated on site. It's jaw dropping, as are the huge skeletons of the mammoths and the saber-toothed cats. There's also a fun exhibit where you can attempt to pull a mechanical plunger out of the tar - makes you feel for the animals that struggled to get free. There's a small parking lot behind the museum; we were able to get a spot there but you do have to pay to park. If you're interested in nature and history, this exhibit is definitely worth your time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/volcanogirl
30,Good to see,Didn't go into the museum just walked around outside which is free and has lots of tar pits with lots of information about each. Most people stayed around the large pit with the elephants,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/108lauram108
40,More for Natural History Buffs,"To fully appreciate the museum, best to go on the the Excavation tour. Gives prospective on the development of the tar pits and all the animals (and one human) found in the pits. Based on the tour, the rest of the museum bits and pieces fall into place. Also, the 3D Titans movie puts the entire evolution of the pits into a easy to understand format.NOTE: The LA County Museum of Art is right next to the La Brea Museum and the Peterson Automotive Museum is just two blocks away. Therefore, just pay once for parking and then walk to these other attractions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/6_Speed_Automatic
40,It was meh,"We only went to see the tar pits so not sure what the museum was like, it was ok. Some of the pits were bubbling, I guess that was neat. Not much to see if you're only going for the pits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mzaccone
50,Excellent Science,"It is difficult to put into words what an interesting place this is to visit. We started at the Lake Tarpit; fascinated but the bubbling tar, sculpture, and story. We wandered around in the Page Museum for a few minutes before watching a 20-minute video about when and how animals came to be trapped and preserved in the tarpits. A young lady talked us into posing in front of a green screen. The resulting pictures were so entertaining that we just had to spend the $40 for the set. We learned that the museum sits near the center of a 10-mile in diameter collection of tarpits. The current construction of the new metro line is uncovering many fossils to be studied at the museum. We watched in amazement as a woman in the lab examined very small fossils under a microscope attach to a screen that allowed us to see what she was seeing. The wall of Dire Wolf skulls is jaw dropping. We played at trying to pull a plunger from the tar which made it obvious why so many animals were trapped in the tar. After the obligatory stop at the gift shop, we wandered around the grounds looking into the currently active pits. If you are even remotely interested in prehistoric science, this is a must visit museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gregorys247
50,Ice Age Experience,The La Brea Tar Pits and Museum is an outstanding experience for young and old. You can walk around the park and actually watch methane gas bubble up from the earth and asphalt oozes from fractures in the soil. The museum has thousands of Ice Age fossils on display from the Ice Age. I really enjoyed myself. I will warn you that parking is hard to find and parking at the museum itself is expensive.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DDay1959
40,Worth a visit if you are in LA,"The museum is loaded with interesting exhibits and fossils. Scientists have been digging up amazing fossils from the Pits for over 100 years. I would have given this a five star review, but the signage to the tar pits in the park on the outside of the museum was very poor.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bobca1947
30,Cool thing to see!,"Not worth spending a ton of time at, but a cool thing to see for sure. Very neat that it is so accessible. You can even see it when you do a Hop On Hop off tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aubreestravel
50,Flash back in time!,"I’ve always wanted to visit the tar pits, finally got the chance and I really enjoyed it. The fossils and recreations of prehistoric animals is so neat. My favorite part was the lake of “tar” water with methane gas causing bubbles all over the surface. It really helps put the past events during the time of the mammoth and Sabre tooth tigers into perspective and brings it to life. Go check it out!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ksimonds87
50,Sticky,Great place to visit unless of court you are a prehistoric animal looking for some wate. Must see it's not to tar from anything!😂,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fredrickrs
30,Glad to finally see it,"I have wanted to check this out since I was a kid. It was cool to see the actual pits. The signs were informative so you could understand what you were looking at & what the time frame was for activity. As you can imagine, though, so much time has passed that they aren't much to look at now. It was especially disappointing to see the original pit that was the very beginning of this museum & seeing that people had tossed trash into it.We aren't huge into pre-history so the indoor part of the museum was of little interest to us. But we are history geeks so we were still glad we stopped by.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IndyCindy13
40,"Plan to go in museum, not just around the grounds","We were on limited time so went to see the pits. The pits are smelly but cool. They have good signage to explain things you are looking at. There are bubbles of tar that have sprung up randomly in the grass that are marked by cones so you don’t accidentally step in any. There are some active pits that are being excavated that are neat to see. There is a museum associated with this that I really wish we had time to go in. Inside, they have fossils of the things excavated in the various pits. La Brea is immediately adjacent to one of the art museums and has several things to see outside that you don’t have to pay for.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ALLSLC
50,Step back in time at La Brea Tar Pits,A must if you're visiting LA. The tar pits are a fascinating look at creatures trapped in the tar pits long ago - including extinct species like the mammoth.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rollagirl
40,Nice park to see the Tar Pits,"We started off be parking in the car park which was $15 for the day.The museum and tar pits is broken up into two admission types:- museum, observation pit, park (lake pit, smaller tar pits, gardens and sculptures): $15- park (lake pit, smaller tar pits, gardens and sculptures): freeWe opted for park only which was free and spent about an hour wandering around the park and looking at the pits. The information provided about them was really interesting and I did learn a lot. You can also walk up to the second floor of the museum and look down into the atrium to see what’s inside. The building itself is a work of art and was good for pictures.We got a drink from a nearby cafe and drunk them under a tree in the shade before we left and it was really nice doing that.The only reason that we didn’t get the $15 package was that we had already been to a museum with fossils and didn’t want to see that again when parking was the same price.It was nice to be in the park on the nice sunny day it was - there are lots of trees for shade, as well as toilets and drinking fountains available within the park. It’s also a good place for dog walking! We saw many dogs there (on leads).I would go back but wouldn’t park in the lot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nzkatieb
40,Fascinating part of history,"If you are in LA, you should definitely visit the tar pits. I recommend going into the museum first to learn more about what you will be seeing outside when you walk through the park. In the museum, be sure to watch the scientists doing their work, it is interesting to see how they work with the materials pulled from the tar pits. When you are done inside, you can visit the park (this part is free) to see the actual tar pits. It is fun to try to see the bones and try to guess which animals they are from. Be sure to check out the signage to learn if your guesses are correct.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C8342TPjulieb
40,Just A Walk-Thru of the Park is Worthwhile,"This reviewer, on this visit, just walked through the park after a visit to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and was struck by the wonderful urban activity in the park. A visit to the Museum eight years ago proved a five-star experience. This visit was only a late summer visit to the park. A walk through with views of the tar pits, their sculptures, and explanatory notes was refreshing in the middle of the city. A good place for tourist children to let off steam.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnH881
40,Quick stop on tour.,"Our tour stopped here for about 15 min. it was neat to see tar pit's. You wait long enough and you will see it boil up out of the ground. this is a working Historical place for fossils... We did not get to go into the museum, but the stop was great.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulhC1926TM
40,Accident find,This was an interesting and inexpensive place. My 9 year old loved to see all the animals and other skeletons we never knew about. Feel the thick tar and visit the pits being excavated.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WinnsAve
40,La Brea Tar Pits,"The tar pits, really asphalt pits are very interesting. It is amazing to learn that over 5 million fossils have been recovered from the pits. Everything from small insects and shellfish to mastodons and saber tooth tigers. We toured the museum and the pits in about an hour and a half. It is well worth the visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/689Scott
50,First time,This was our first trip here and I have to say we expected to only stay 30 Minutes or so. However once we arrived and then entered the museum we were very impressed at the offerings available to us. Not only the displays but also the different movies and guided tours. In total we spent about fours there and only did the tar pits.It is amazing to watch the gas bubble up in the lake or to see tar bubbling to surface between the grass in places. Taking the guided tour (which is included) of the grounds and the work they are doing here is amazing. There have been over five million fossils recovered from this area from mammoths to saber tooth cats to 4000 Dire Wolfs.Touring the grounds our guide provided us with a in-depth understanding of the on going work happening here.If you go plan on at least 3 to 4 hours to fully get the complete experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brucelE1059AO
50,World's most extensive and valuable collections of natural and cultural history!,"It's hard to imagine this place existing right in the middle of downtown. The La Brea Tar Pits are one of the most famous fossil localities. We get to explore the world’s only active, urban Ice Age excavation site. Inside the Museum is a wide intact collection of the best fossils, animals, and plants that have been discovered here — mammoths, saber-toothed cats, dire wolves, and more.You can buy tickets ahead of time at the kiosks next to the parking lot to save some time. The tickets are for the museum; however the park/tar pits are free. The museum itself was ok, a lot smaller than I expected. One of the cool aspects was the live demonstrations they do where you can watch them work. Tickets to the museum also included a 3d show so it was nice and cool to relax for about 20 mins.It's just nice to walk around and view the still bubbling tar pits and enjoy the park. This is an on going project on excavation and finding more fossils and the maps are very clear on where to walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NyonyaLady
50,Behind-the-scenes Fossil Lab Tour,"LBTP has a Late Night Friday behind-the-scenes tour of their Fossil Lab.  Since we were going to be in LA on a Friday, we reserved tickets.  A lab tech first showed us their large collection of various fossilized sabertooth skulls, huge mammoth bones, turtle shells & bison horns to complete bird & animal skeletons located in their storage facility that is not viewable by the general public. We then went inside the lab where lab techs answered our questions and explained how they clean various fossils. One fossil was a rare fox skull, only two have ever been found in the pits. When we viewed the outside pits before the lab tour; a large methane gas eruption occurred right in front of us.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OTR_Again_IM
50,Totally fascinating,"Right in the middle of downtown, and with easy parking and access ... we found this attraction totally fascinating. The park is pleasant and intriguing, and offers an insight into the LA of 100 years ago when it was all oil wells. The museum is superb, with many skeletons of ice-age animals which were found in the pits. It is great to watch the archeologists at work, both in the museum and outside in one pit which is still being worked on. We found the optional $5 3D movie a bit underwhelming and pale, but interesting nevertheless. There is no food on sale but lots of places only a few minutes walk away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tonymf
40,I like this place,"This is well worth one trip/visit. Lots to see and over the years its changes (exhibit-wise) , so if you haven't been there for a while, go one back and they'll be more and different things to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H51OGjoelb
50,"Very interesting, not overwhelming.","This is a museum for families and adults interested in prehistoric, post-ice age Southern California and the animals that roamed here. Good presentations that do not overwhelm, the excavated lake and tar pits where bones of literally a milion animals perished and were preserved. Learned about the ecosystem then. Models are fun to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/782allans
40,Tar Pit museum is a venue frozen in time,"It has been over 45+ years since I saw the La Brea Tar Pits. While on a family to Disneyland, my parents stopped briefly at this short stop. The timeline was somewhere around 1969 to 1971. I could only recollect at the Tar Pit being somewhat of a strange place. Here you have a black smelly pool that occasionally ‘burped’ a methane gas bubble. It was a short visit.FAST FORWARD to 2018. The La Brea Tar Pits opened as a museum in 1977.The admission cost is $15 (for adults). Our group of three paid the price of admission (not knowing what to expect). We entered the exhibit area and experienced it in a clockwise fashion. The venue consists of several old style anthropological displays. Definitely nothing digital in the first 3/4 of the museum. I would say that the portion of the museum we enjoyed has remained largely unchanged (from when it was first opened in 1977) . For me it reminded me of when I was very young, and so I enjoyd the museum. Sabertooth tiger and Woolly Mamouth Bears, Ancient Condor (and other bird bones) on display.On the day we went there were at least 3 employees doing ‘hands on’ Q & A on the specimens. The museum features an active Fossil Lab. There were two staff working meticulously to clean and prepare fossils. The last 1/3 of the museum has more modern (newer) displays (in addition to an optional fee based 3D movie presentation).We opted for the 2pm grounds tour by Guide Amanda. The tour consisted of walking to three different areas of the property. Amanda presented very intresting facts about the past (and present) history of the La Brea Tar Pits). I found this walk to be the highlight of the visit. After each presentation, Amanda fielded questions. This allowed the group to get information and understand more about the Tar Pit Museum.In summary I would recommend a visit if you would like to be have a greater understanding about fossils. As I mentioned earlier, there is not much digital going on here. Our group enjoyed the cisit, and felt the $15 was well spent. Time spent at the museum was 2 hours 15 minutes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dagoose9500
40,It's sounds boring but it's not!,This is a perfect stop for any science geeks. It is thorough but doesn't offer so much that you get bored. The museum is the best place to start. Everything else makes more sense after reading some history. We spent less than 2 hours here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SEFowler
40,Tar!,"While we did not go inside the museum, we did walk around the grounds. I had read about the tar pits way back in elementary school. It was very neat to see it in person. Without going in, you can still see several pits. A great addition to our visit to LACMA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bdfenwick
40,Good for about an hour,Great info and fossils to look at and learn. Make sure you get the 3D movie tickets in advance because they sell out quick . They have a cool little path to walk in the middle . You don’t need that much time inside and you can see the actual tar pit area without admission !,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lb33wonka
30,Great for younger kids,"We went because we have always heard about the tar pits. Cool fossils and interesting history about the city, but probably better suited for families with younger kids. Mine (10 and 13) weren’t as interested.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChristineEspen
50,Great learning experience,The museum is not very large but t well designed and interesting. The 3 D movie gives a short introduction to the animals and the Brea pits. Excavations aré continuos and fascinating,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/50Beatrizy
50,Full of adventure for entire family!,"Fun, exciting, and educational from the outside tar pits to the mammoth bone collection. All family members will be amazed at the experience which includes movies!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/520debbic
40,"Educational Visit, Great for Families","This is a very educational activity, my 12 year old son really enjoyed it. It is easy to find, and easy to park. The entire attraction can be done in a few hours, it is a very worthwhile visit. As soon as you get out of your car, you can smell the tar pits. There is a nice walking path that guides you around all the pits that are outside. If you are in the area and have the time, you and your children will enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Love2TravelUS
50,Just walked/ran around the grounds - good space,"If you’re looking for a fun outdoor activity - check out the grounds of the tar pit. There are lots of placards and, you guessed it, tar pits that are interesting to look at. It looks like there are tours as well. We didn’t do the museums but it looks like you could spend quite a bit of time there with people of all ages. Kind of a cool little haven in the middle of Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/454christinac
40,Quick and informative,"We bought tickets to the museum online in hopes to avoid any lines. Didn’t really make a difference because there was really no line to get in anyway. The tickets to the indoor museum were cheap and the museum is small. We did the whole thing in about an hour (our kids are 2 and 5, however). You don’t have to buy tickets if you just want to do the outdoor exhibits (something I didn’t know until we got there). The indoor exhibits feature lots of fossils and you can see the lab where they work on fossils, etc; but I found the outside more interesting (and free which is always a plus).Parking is a nightmare. Don’t pay for the museum parking lot ($15 on a flat, unshaded lot). We went on Sunday so street parking was free and lots of trees providing shade to the cars. We did have to circle the park twice before we caught someone leaving and snagged their space. Great for a quick afternoon or early morning stop, but don’t plan to spend the whole day here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/madrehoodandoils
40,"Very informative, and very unique, in the heart of Los Angeles.","This is a must go to place, at least once, when hitting the sights in L.A. I have wanted to go for years, and finally went with my daughter and grand kids. The museum is small enough to see in an hour if you are in a hurry, is nicely laid out, and is nicely air conditioned. They have many animal skeletons on display recovered from the pits, including a huge mastodon with giant tusks that seem 10 feet long. They have two shows, an interactive 15 minute, and a 3 d movie about 25 minutes. Both are informative, but the interactive show is the best in my opinion. The grand kids, 5 and 7, were pretty attentive during this one. Be sure to also explore the grounds to see the active dig sites still being used, plus the tar lake that shows how the animals were captured.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/georgep839
50,Learned a lot!,"My family had a great time exploring. I am glad we took the outdoor tour, learned a whole lot more! Great gift shop too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tako9
40,A great experience,"It was a very fine museum. Exciting to see all the tar pits and the fossils. The ""nerds"" walking around inside the museum were very informative and kind both to show and tell alot of things about the tar pits and the animals found.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Diskolydia
40,Worth seeing if...,"Went to the car pits for two reasons, one was to max the value on my Go LA card,the other was my son's love of fossils.So the cost I felt was quite high, we were there 2 hours ,arriving at 3pm but still had to pay 15 dollars to park. The pits are free but entry to the museum is extra (not with my card). It was interesting though and both my son and I really enjoyed it. Fascinating to see the history of LA and then look up and see the present day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E5199FSnickb
40,A different type of museum,"We took our kids (4 and 6) to see the tar pits and museum. They really enjoyed it, especially looking into the lab where the fossils were being sorted. The staff were very friendly and informative.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travelust4ever
50,Real fossils!!,It is a super cool museum where you can see the real recent fossils. Tons of dare wolves. It is very close to the LA county museum.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HMO2013
40,Fun afternoon discovering the hidden pre-historic history of Los Angeles!,"It had been a while since my girlfriend and I had been to the La Brea Tar Pits. In fact, the last time may have been in the early 1990s when we were both still in school! After an easy drive, and no problem finding parking, we walked around the main Tar Pit, with the re-created animals, and entered the museum where we took an official tour. Our guide was entertaining, patient and very informative. She even brought us to a current excavation. The tour lasted about an hour and was entertaining, informative and enjoyable. Its truly amazing the sheer amount of animals bones they have excavated from the pits as well as the flora and fauna. Inside the museum were fossils, stuffed animals, and representations of life around the Pits in the past. We highly recommend visiting if you are looking for a fun escape in LA! We wren also very fortunate that on the of our visit they had blocked off the streets and had a food truck fair with 20-30 food trucks!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lonniem845
50,Fun Adventure,"I visited the La Brea tar pits originally in 1971. There was no museum at that time, there was only the lake pit and one area where you could view fossils in tar. The museum is extraordinary. There are Paleontologist working on fossils that you can watch during your visit. There are active pits and storage chambers. There are fossils of sabertooth tigers, woolly mammoth’s, 400 dire fox skulls, etc. Well worth the trip and only $15 admission. I highly recommend it to families and anyone who has an interesting history",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jbg79
40,Really cool!,"I've never seen anything like it. You can actually smell the asphalt as it bubbles through the ground. Tours were somewhat geared towards children, but informative. Nice collection of food trucks out front. Saturday evening they were having a concert out back- really neat!Lots of museums in this area. Park in the garage and make a day of it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sazoram
40,Very interesting.,"Not much to see here, but it is cool to see the tar pits which are still bubbling up. The museum is nice and has a lot of bones from animals recovered from the tar, but kind of pricey considering you can get through it in about an hour or less. If you want to save some money, you might want to skip the museum which was sixty one dollars for five people and see the tar pits which is free. Well worth seeing though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WoodridgeGreg
30,Tar Pits,"We only did looked at the Tar Pits, didn't do the museum. Parking was a flat $15. There is some tar oozing through in the parking lot and grassy areas, so be mindful of where you step. The display in the park area is informational and interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mamabear135
40,There's Nothing Like It,"Bones and tar and gardens oh my! This collection of bones will make you appreciate your cushy existence. It's fascinating to see how much effort scientists have put into assembling found bones. Even if they're off in their assembly, the finished skeletons are definitely worth a few minutes stare. Dinosaurs, jungle cats, massive elephants all without skin--wow! There's a theater and a fantastic gift shop and a garden in the center, topped by a geodesic atrium that makes for a relaxing place to reflect on this kind of history. The best thing, besides all those bones, is the tar pit exhibit outside near Wilshire Boulevard. You've gotta see it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/492nathanieln
50,Rare place on Earth,This is one of the most rarest place on earth we’re you can see an actual tar pit. Plus they are always digging up next fossils. It also has a museum that exhibits what they’ve found. If you plan to go make sure to get the museum pass to save money and visit multiple locations.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Darth_Amador
50,Very entertaining visit,Really enjoyed our experience here. Wanted to see all the fossils and cool displays. Staff was great. Lots of stuff to see. Large gift shop. Really cool photo opportunity too. The outside areas have a ton to see also.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robertc641
40,Little Boy’s Dream come True,"I had been here on school field trips & always found it fascinating. Back then there was no museum. Just took my 8 year old, dinosaur obsessed, grandson to this educational treasure & he was enthralled. It’s very visual & has lots of interesting information & history. Also, the active laboratory & active dig sites are a definite plus. I recommend this Museum for anyone, but especially for dinosaur loving little boys!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeffnTerry
10,Protesting Poor Museum Management,"This is an interesting museum and there is enough of a story behind the tar pits to justify a 1-2 hour visit.The low score is to protest that the museum, having taken your money, does nothing to ensure that its policies are enforced. At the beginning of the 3D movie, which costs extra, the greeter pointedly asked everyone to avoid talking and to turn off celphones. Almost immediately one child of about 3 years age started talking in a loud voice, demanding her father’s attention. He mostly ignored her, and ignored several Shhs from others, throughout the 25 minutes. Halfway through, he gave her a phone so she could play video games, which cast a strong light in the faces of everyone nearby.After the show, in the museum proper, the child continued to scream for her father’s attention and he did nothing. She could be heard over the voice of the tour guide. And it never stopped. No museum staff ever approached.Of course no customer wants to get into a fight with another person. And that’s why museums and similar institutions need to decide if their personnel are going to enforce their rules, or are content for the experience of hundreds of paying customers to be considerably adversely affected by a few persons with no manners.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MannyG2000
50,Fascinating...History in the making!,Honestly didn't know what this was but several people recommended it. Great to walk around. The Museum was great only takes about an hour...think it is half price after 4. Was not too crowded. Never had scene anything like it before.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashnneal

50,Facinating destination for all ages,"I was here 30 years ago with my husband and was fascinated. Came west to visit family in LA and surrounding areas only to find they had not been to the Tar Pits. We arrived at 4 pm and discovered on Fridays the museum stays open until 8pm, and the admission price is discounted. Also, LA county residents with ID receive free admission.The museum itself is kid friendly, doable in an hour and a half, and is entertaining for all ages. Subject matter is riveting. The tar pits themselves are still actively bubbling away, and are still being explored. Many outdoor exhibits as well.All this in the middle of Beverly Hills!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fivekampers

50,Amazing Museum and lot of things to learn,"The La Brea Tar Pits and Museum was one of those places I though I won't enjoy much, but, boy, did I!First, you get to see and smell what a tar pit looks like, and please, don't touch. Also, you get to see a lot of people recovering bones from the tar pits, lots of fossils and learn about them as well. It was really fun for a group of adults, so I do think children would enjoy it just as much as we did, maybe more since you can see huge fossils :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/307gis

No it doesn't have dinosaurs but it does have mammoths, sabre tooth tigers and dire wolves which are equally impressive. You can see the dig taking place and learn about how the tar pits came about. I would recommend the free tour as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/blob232

50,"Very fun, informative, and accommodating/entertaining for people of all ages!","My family visited the La Brea Tar Pits and Museum while I was in LA and I must say I wasn’t expecting much (simply based on the name and nothing more); however, I was mistaken. The tar pits/excavation sites are incredibly interesting (if you take advantage of the free tours that depart every half hour they’re made better by the kind and informative guides). The exhibits themselves are very interesting for anyone whether you have an interest in paleontology or not, and although the museum is not very large I guarantee you will spend a solid 2 hours there. Next time I’ll try to see the 3D movies they offer (tickets were sold out). Cannot recommend enough!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cahnola
50,You Gotta Do It,"You cannot come here to Los Angeles and not see this. I knew about this when I was a kid. It's like ""sacred."" This is a place to touch pre-history! (And you'll recognize it from many movies.) It's ancient stuff ""still happening."" Stuff (goopy, black tar) is still oozing right into the park. Not just in the fenced off areas---but right there, in the grass. Be careful where you walk! And there's 'digs' scatted about. This is REAL! It's not just some fake EPCOT exhibit (no disrespect or offense intended--I love that stuff too). You will see more skulls of animals (Saber Tooth tigers who fell victim and others) than most anywhere on the planet. It's just an amazing, real, awesome opportunity to brisdge the past to the present, and also experience why Los Angeles is still a seismic, geologically active place in the world. Do it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/454williammarkl
50,I was fascinated,"This is well planned,beautifully constructed modern museum. I learned much about the saber tooths, the mammoths, the mastodons that inhabited the area and left intact fossil remains. There were many helpful docents to help explain the exhibits. Well worth a visit. The 3D movie was pretty good in explaining the geological history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/starpost
40,Great small museum!,"This is a nice museum to visit with kids. They have tar pits where many fossils have been found on the outside and then a small museum on the inside. My kids (boys ages 13 and 9) thought it was great. It’s not a big museum though, so you won’t need more then 1 - 1.5 hours there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tinasJ1795QG
50,Interesting history,"The La Brea Tar Pits provide a glimpse into a history that dates back to the saber tooth tigers, it was facinating to see the tar bubbling and knowing that it has done so for such a long time. It is free to walk around and recommend it to families!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/s2ckley
50,Visit on a very hot day,"It was 106 degrees the day we visited. It is something to see, the tar actually bubbling up in the water in the middle of the city.Museum thankfully is air conditioned. Really interesting and especially for kids. Great exhibits and being able to watch the paleontologist to work is nice.They have an exhibit where you can pull on a metal stick stuck in the tar to get loose, wow now I could see how the animals couldn't get out. They also have movies which cost extra.Would recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dapmag3
40,"Bubbling Tar Pits and dinosaurs, what more can you ask for?","A visit to the Tar Pits is truly an opportunity to get a dose of ancient history. I didn't really know what a tar pit was until I came here. The bubbling tar pit is like a big lake, the signage helps to understand what they are. A visit to the museum provides much more detail and and a historic timeline.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RecreationV
50,Cool place to visit!,"Lots of neat exhibits on both the fossils and the history of the site. It doesn't take a lot of time either but it's very, very interesting. Be sure to walk around the outside of the museum to see active dig sites and more tar pits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SuzyRW
50,Are You from Calif: When Did You Last Visit?,"For many who grew up in California, visiting the La Brea Tar Pits was something you did in elementary school.As an adult, it is one of those things that you should do again. It is a trip well worth taking. You can visit the actual tar pits and walk the grounds without a fee. But the most fascinating part of our trip was spending the few dollars to visit the museum.Also, walk the grounds because there so many fascinating things to see. For example, you can see archeologists methodically searching through the ancient tar which is, we learned, actually asphalt and not tar.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jtedhunt
40,Surprisingly interesting,"The tar pits are free to look at outside and were interesting to look at, especially watching the water and tar bubble! But to have it in context the admission fee to the museum and the 3d show about the ice age is definitely worth it! The show was so informative and explained how it all came about and their theory on how the mammals discovered were in the tar in the first place. The museum is small but it was something different and quite engaging knowing that what your looking at are the bones from mammals that were extinct and from 40,000 years ago!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nelzgirl
40,A new fossil every day,"We enjoyed this museum and were particularly surprised that they find a new fossil every day (on average). Yes, the pits smell strongly of tar but it is not really that bad in the open air. The museum itself was spacious and did a great job of telling its story.The one thing that really stuck with me was a display of hundreds of dire wolf skulls.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/allecher
30,"I love the smell of tar in the morning. Smells like, well, smells like tar.","I enjoyed walking the grounds, which is free. The tar pits were interesting to see and watching the workers was fascinating to me. There is excellent signage explaining what you're seeing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnsW671VR
50,FUN IN THE TAR!,"OH here's another great L.A. place, right near LACMA. Imagine the vast tar pits on which L.A. is actually built (you can still smell them on Wilshire Blvd, across from the museum). Stroll in the park and see the imitation mammoths that once roamed the area, and by all means visit the museum and the endless fossils. A whole new vision of the glorious city of the angels (and tar pits)!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/miriyamg
40,Cool.....,"Did not go in museum, but had a nice time walking around the pit and seeing the re-enactment of a mastodon getting stuck. There is a powerful odor of tar and hydrogen sulfide emerging from the pit.....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GoFryGo
50,A must see if you like archaeology.,"This place is simply fascinating! Once again I did a solo visit as the rest of the family was shopping, but the displays, expanations, and history of the tar pits (actually naturally occurring ashphalt) are superbly done, and well worth a visit for anyone interested in our ancient past.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlenC527
40,Really interesting,"I personally don’t normally like museums, but this was really interesting, the tar pits and the number of fossils found and to also see everyone in action, the tour was also interesting and our guide was excellent",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LisaP4130

40,Unique Day in LA,"We chose this because it's California and you have to, right? My ten year old son really enjoyed the museum inside, and it was a pleasant walk around outside to view the tarpits. Very reasonable way to spend a couple of hours. Walking distance to several other museums so a great stop to see some very cool exhibits. Their souvenir shop is not bad and we ended up buying the picture book. We went during a Thursday and it was not crowded and a very pleasant experience.Got lucky with street parking on the back of the park. We started at La Brea, then went to Petersent Automotive, then returned in just under 4 hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gomavs2004
50,Time to spare,"We hadn't planned a visit to the tar puts, but as we had some time in LA, we decided to go. We had seen the pits in films and tv shows but didn't really know much about them.What a great discovery. Lots of interesting information about the tar pits and the fossils found there over the past 100 years.To see just how many animals were caught in the tar all those years ago and how well preserved in the tar was amazing...and right in the heart of a modern city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Airthy
40,Interesting for all ages,"Nature has created a unique place in the world. In the middle of a city, we have tar created millions of years ago bubbling up in front of your eyes. If that was not interesting enough, we have a treasure trove of bones from animals that have been extinct for tens of thousands of years.The volunteers do a great job in explaining the process by which this happens and make it accessible to all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/edm109
50,Great Family Fun,"We all enjoyed looking at the tar pits, of course the Lake Tar Pit is the most interesting. The smell of the tar really is a surprise and really adds another layer to the story for kids too. Then going into the museum,we watched the 3D movie about the ice age. Informative and great to see first before exploring museum. Nicely set up exhibits especially the Fossil Lab and all their amazing finds, the wall of dire wolves skulls is impressive. Good for about a 90 minute visit then on with your day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sweetphotoingnomad
40,Great to see history in the making,"Great place to visit and see history in the making, you can see the current excavation and parts of skeletons being exposed.Each of the tap pits has a bit of information about how the animals got trapped in the tar, the best is the lake tar pit with the model elephants getting stuck in tar.The museum has done a great job of showing the recovered skeletal remains, and telling the history of the tar pits both modern and historic.The Sabre Tooth Tiger turning from a skeleton to a fully fleshed tiger is very interesting.This is something for everyone kids or adults. It was $12 each for seniors to get in.We missed the parking area for the Tar Pits and ended up in Museum of the Arts which is next door cost $16 but that was for a full day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/blc45reb

40,Family Fun on the Cheap,"This place is somewhere unique to take out-of-town visitors, has plenty of on-street parking and is priced very reasonably.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/921kathrynj
50,Nice Surprise,"Tar Pits do not sound appealing. I went to the museum reluctantly to please my family. I am glad I did. I was fascinated to learn about an aspect of Los Angeles that I was totally unaware of. The museum is small which is a plus, and educates without overwhelming. I urge fellow skeptics to visit! When we exited the museum the air temperature was 110 so we had to take a pass on the grounds!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/me0h2017
50,10 STARS for Children,"This was a highlight in LA with the grounds being open, clean and well monitored, and the museum was STUNNING...well laid out, interactive for children, informative and kind staff members. Really enjoyed the exhibits!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dpresley2016
50,Loved the complex,"We thought this was a very cool day out. It was interesting to see and learn about this part of biological history in the area, and we enjoyed all the information presented. We were fascinated by how many animals had been trapped, especially in the dire wolf display.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shanj2014
40,Near activity to spend an hour or so at.,This is a pretty cool place to visit if in LA and you need a quick activity. Read about it online first. These Tar pits they are still pulling fossils from 30000 years ago out of. The tar pits aren’t what I expected. They look kind of like a dirty pond....but still cool to think that bones from so long ago have been preserved.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Baue10
50,Tar Pits are Great!,"If you have a kid, go. If you don't, go anyway. If you like art, it's next to LACMA, if you like cars, it's very near the Petersen Auto Museum. It's easy to access, does not need to take long, but is entirely unique in this world, meaning you won't find such a place anywhere. Go, learn, and enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LindaHepner
40,Good museum for its narrow focus,"This museum is excellent at what it does: displaying remains from the nearby tar pits. However, the exhibits are pretty limited compared to other museums...because the subject matter is so limited. I had a good time but I was able to see all the exhibits in less than an hour. The highlights are the amazing ""evolution of life"" mural (which they don't sell posters of...) and the tar pits, which are outside and don't require an admission fee. It's worth going just to say you went, but I probably won't go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/naturetack
50,Great outing,Wonderful place very interesting the staff were very informative !! We enjoyed the museum it was beautiful,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robertapH7459ZZ
40,Amazing display,"We paid the $15 each 5o visit the general exhibit (doesn’t include the 3D movie). Great displays and ver interesting. We spent about 90 minutes then walked the grounds outside. If you visit on the first Tuesday of the month it’s free, except for July and August. Well worth the visit. We were staying at the Grove and walked which was easy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tsutt35
40,Nice quick visit,My family loved this place for about 5 minutes. They are 4 and 11 and had no interest I hope because they were tired. I myself have been here twice and think it’s historical significance is impressive. I have not paid to go to the museum parts of the park but for me I enjoyed it still. Be careful there is tar lurking to get on you if you don’t watch out.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dkboyer2000
50,Fantastic!,"Finally drove up from San Diego to the tar pits and was not disappointed. We were amazed by the number of fossils. I would advise touring the museum before venturing out to see the tar pits and active excavations. It was good to discover the history of La Brea, understand how the animals were trapped and became fossils and learn about how the site is actively working today. Very highly recommended!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/688charlottej
50,LA Vacation .,"This is not too be missed , a real eyeopener .Take the time to visit the Museum and see the sights on offer - well worth checking out",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/U408MSmichaeld
50,Very cool experience,"Until I was planning a trip to LA, I did not even know this Museum existed. I was so intrigued by the history and background at the Tar pits and the museum. To gain an understanding of what California was like during the ice age.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nfarst
50,Well worth a visit,Bones! Lots of Bones! How many Dire Wolves skulls can you count? What a cool place. I didn't know anything about tar pits; go find out.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/13allic
30,You don't need to pay to see the tar pits. The best part is free!,"The inside area, is the bit you pay for and was ok, but the interesting view of the bubbling asphalt is free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ghade63
50,Real life and live museum,"Situated in the heart of Los Angeles you come across this gem which explores the ice age in real time. Each day new fossils of Sabre tooth cats, giant sloths and Columbian mammoths come back to life as these bones are carefully extracted from the tar pits (ashphalt seeps)see palaeontologists at work next to volunteers, carefully extracting these mysteries from the past giving a great insight into the last ice age. This great museum has loads to do inside and out with guides to explain the processes involved. Well worth a visit on Wilshire Boulevard $20for adults which includes a great 3D movie. The kids will love it too. Allow three hours. No food available thee but outlets less than 250metres away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/swa58717
30,Good to do with extra time.,Nice quaint little museum to occupy your time for about two hours max. Good for those who like dinosaurs and a little bit of history. The atrium in the middle of the museum is nice.I would not specifically go out of my way to go to this museum.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Traveler247365
20,Am I missing something here?,"I don't understand the draw to this place, I mean its ok but honestly feels like a tourist trap. The museum itself is ok but when you venture out to the tar pits it looks like just a bunch of old muddy swamps, am I to believe there are really relics below the surface? I don't know just something about this place felt fake and touristy. I wasn't impressed and was disappointed after visiting the excellent LACMA next door.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashleysK4355MG
40,Interesting,"We visited on a Science Center Passport and so we were able to enter the museum at no cost. The museum is small but has several bones on display. The most impressive part was the grounds, which you can walk around for free. I would recommend visiting on a Sunday morning/early afternoon. We were able grab free street parking close to the Tar Pits and not have to fight crowds and field trips.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StacyCorbin

50,One of a kind,"I learned about the La Brea Tar Pits in elementary school many years ago, and it was wonderful to see it in person. This is a must if you are visitng Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jmsblest
50,Well done approach to a unique part of natural history,"I had a vague memory of visiting the tar pits when I was little (at least 15 years ago), which mostly focused on the mammoth sculpture stuck in the tar pit. I wasn't expecting too much but felt it was a fun thing to do while I had guests in town. To be honest, I really enjoyed the visit. The museum is small, easily covered in an hour, but they offer free tours of the surrounding tar pits (45 minute tour) that are really informative. There are many volunteers on site to answer questions and give you more insight into the unique tar pits.If you haven't seen the tar pits in a few years, definitely worth an afternoon to go back and explore them.One thing to note - there is a $15 charge for parking, which I wasn't expecting. You may be able to find cheaper parking further away, but given its location, not sure. Just something to be aware of.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/futureconsultant
50,Amazing and oh yeah Amazing,"The park is was interesting and without a doubt one of the must do things in LA. Pleasent, mostly level paths lead you through the park and give great insight int to the world at the time of the Ice Age. The park appeared to be free, parking was all day $15.00 and the museum was $15.00 well spent. Totally and completely an educational milestone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Prothos49
40,Ordinary,A nice small museum to spend a few hours. The excavation tour is better with some representatives than others. All in all a good way to spend the afternoon if you are into history and fossils.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/samdsamd

50,Mind blown,"I learned so much at this museum. Definitely get tickets for the 3-D movie that does a nice job explaining the Ice Age and the tar pits. My teens and tweens enjoyed it, but not as much as me.Seeing the Fish Bowl and walking around the tar pits was also amazing. It’s crazy that the tar pits are STILL active!! And there are scientist and volunteers STILL working 24/7 uncovering all new fossils. Simply amazing!I saw lots of folks having picnics on property and rolling down the hill. I was in a wheelchair, and the museum was quite accommodating.You can enjoy it in an hour, but plan to spend at least two hours to see and try everything.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/75peaches
50,So Glad We Made the Trip,"As others have noted, there is parking meter and street parking in the neighborhoods around the area if you don't want to pay for the lot. We easily found space about a block away and parked on Curson in a two hour zone. Our time at the tar pits was under two hours. We walked around the outside part first, which is free. It's a nice park with some signs around the various pits and there was one active pit that we could see with signs as well. If we had just done that much I would have been pretty happy. However, I really wanted to see more fossils and learn more after our walk. So we paid to see the museum. My daughter had her student ID from her high school and they gave her a student discount. We did not pay to see the film. The inside of the museum was jam packed with fossils and we also enjoyed watching the volunteers working in the ""clean room"". We went in the middle of the afternoon on a Friday. It was not crowded at all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/waltertP2136WO
50,Better Than I Thought It Would BE,We went early morning on a Monday. There were quite a few kids on a field trip but that is okay. We visited the main tar pit with the elephant sculptors before heading inside. We purchased the entry fee and tickets to the short 3D film. That process was quick and painless. The 3D film was fun and educational.The museum inside was informative and interesting. I learned much about the tar pit history and its founding. They had many skeletons of the animals that have been found in the tar pits along with useful information.There is a section of the museum where you can watch actual workers doing what they do with the fossils that are collected in the pits. That was very interesting.If you are in the Los Angeles area-I highly recommend stopping by.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DavidFrmTexas
30,Very cool to see - but ...,Make sure you go on the first Tuesday of the month (outside of July and August) - you can get in for free! You are still paying for the $15 parking - however that is about what this is worthloved to see it - however watch the time/costs,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/421RickH
50,Checked off my wife’s bucket list.,"Spent a couple of hours this morning at the La Brea Tar Pits. Between 1913 and 1915, scientists recovered over 750,000 species from the pits. Around the grassy areas of the park, you sometimes see traffic cones warning visitors of seepage forcing its way up in a new place. The museum has very nice displays of posed skeletons. The history board was full of fascinating facts about how the pit was discovered, excavated and developed.There are a couple of real bones on display that could be touched to feel the texture. Another section that the family found interesting was the six or seven cleaning stations that the more important bone finds pass through to get all the tar off, cataloged and cleaned to a displayable state. One interactive display, allows the explorer to try to extract two different sized disks from a vat of tar. One quickly learns that the effort to extract something from the tar is directly proportional to the cross section of the footprint. One stuck foot generally leads to two, which quickly leads to the animal falling onto it’s side. Then its just a mater of time until the end arrives. There is decaying stuff in the pit, which sends bubbles of gas up through the tar. Those gas bubbles act to stir up the bones imbedded in the tar so that pieces of skeletons are somewhat scattered in the tar. Outside, we viewed an open pit they have excavated to remove more bones.Something that we were always curious about was, “why would animals walk into the tar in the first place?”. Well, it turns out that there is a thin level of water that floats on top of the tar pit, making it look like a watering hole, which the animals are naturally attracted to.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Road_Warrior32034
30,Interesting visit for a couple of hours,"I would recommend skipping the 3D movie. It added very little to the experience. Otherwise, they had some interesting exhibits inside.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A6724TKchrisr
30,Good walkaround the tarpits. Carry your own water and food!,"We were travelling in the summer and it was quite a hot day. The smell of the tar can be quite overwhelming at first. The information provided is really good and also interesting for kids. Sadly,there were no provisions for buying water on that very hot day,forget about food! They have a few benches where we took some respite from the summer heat. However,when traveling with kids, I would strongly advise one to carry lots of water, especially in the summer!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/666LOE

The history of the tar pits is also interesting.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luvmenow
50,Great little stop,Took my husband and daughter to this place. At first they were thinking we paid to get into a park but the more we walked around outside and then inside the more the realized how cool it was! You can walk around outside for free but you have to pay to go inside the museum. That’s were all of the cool fossils are! I highly recommend this with children. My daughter is 11 and loves animals and history so this was a great stop!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emilypD425ZY
40,A Fascinating Trip Back in Time,"We spent two+ delightful hours at the tar pits on a perfect afternoon. The pits are pools of seeping asphalt that trapped unsuspecting wooly mammoths and hundreds of other ancient creatures in a sticky goo, condemning them to an agonizing death but preserving their skeletons in near perfect fossil form. It's an amazing place on many counts: it wasn't discovered until people began drilling for oil in 1912 or thereabouts; when it was discovered -- in what is now the center of LA -- there was nothing on the spot at all but dozens of oil rigs (as late as 1912!); while you're visiting the pits and the museum, you find yourself immersed in a world of strange, now extinct, creatures 2,000 to 32,000 years ago; and, finally, the museum itself, while accomplished and impressive, is itself trapped in a sort of time warp circa 1970: for instance, while they show a timeline up to the ""present"", that timeline ends after the Apollo moon landing but we'll before the age of desktop computers (let alone laptops, Internet or cell phones); also, many of the exhibit signs are handwritten and/or animated in clunky diorama-style models. Whatever, it's a great experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jaseaton
40,We only saw the Tar pits which were amazing,We never went into the museum but just saw the tar pits through the fence. We got some good commentary from our guide. This place was just amazing and to find out that they discovered the Hairy mammoths tusks here was just incredible. Worth a fence view. The place is still bubbling away after all the millions of years,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/olie293

40,Must See for the Family,"I had always heard about the La Brea Tar Pits. I was so glad we found them. I was excited to see they are still excavating. The smell is strong outside, however, otherwise I would have given it 5 stars. The Museum is smaller than I would have liked but the exhibits are outstanding.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/abbyandchris17
50,A Must Do Experience,We had an excellent guide and the exhibits are fascinating. We also did the 3D movie which kids would really enjoy. Check for Free Days to save money!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Venture465502
50,Fascinating but a bit expensive,"Fascinating history explained in the museum -- the tar pits are outside and can be explored for free, but worth it to go inside to better understand the history. Kept the attention of everyone in our three-generation family. Next door is the well-known LACMA art museum – has a great collection but didn’t have time to visit. Parking lots were full, but we found an inexpensive space on the street.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SandyRiver
50,INcredable,We only had a short time in LA so Being a History Major wanted to see the tar pits. With the ststues you could easily picture what life was like at that time.There were busses of kids on field day and it was great to see them interested in history. Inside the museum the life like sounds of several animals gave a thrilling life like appeal to those animals. Also the displays of animals skulls that had been in the pits; made you realize just how dangerous they could still be.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/921pamelap
50,Fascinating,This exhibit alone made the long flight from England worth it for me. I found the whole exhibit fascinating and very well done. The film is a definite must if it’s your first trip. Watch where you walk as there are new tar areas all the time ( they put cones on top of them) so you can get tar on your shoes if you walk near these.Was great to watch people actually working on preserving these fossils.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bab5y
40,Worth the visit,We really enjoyed our recent visit to the La Brea tar pits. The tour was great. The girl was so informative. We got to visit the active tar pits. The grounds are free. The museum was very interesting. We enjoyed seeing the fossils. Like the saber tooth cat. Parking was expensive. The museum lot was full. But we are glad we got to learn about the tar pits.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zaidtree
40,"Not what I expected, worth it.","I really did not know what to expect when my daughter suggested to stop by. They do a real nice job explaining the history around the pits and how they recover the fossils. I was mind boggling to think that as we walked around we were surrounded by the city. It is also fascinating to think that the asphalt is still bubbling up to the surface. You can even smell it. You can walk the grounds for free, but if you want to go into the museum (I recommend) or see the excavation sites you will need to pay admission.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robertmG1402FA
40,Worth the Visit,"This is my 3rd time visiting the La Brea tar pits and I learn a little bit more each time that I go. The actual fossils would get a 5 star experience but I gave it 4 because I think the admission is a bit steep. It would make a family of 4 a pretty steep trip. The staff was AMAZING. Everyone was very nice, friendly, and very informative. The woman with the thick New York accent is a wealth of knowledge and a treasure. It was very cool to see all the fossils (especially the mammoth)If you are planning on visiting the tar pits, make sure you scout out parking before going. The garages around can be very very steep. I think we ended up paying $24 to park for 2 hours. There must be cheaper options. We were crunched for time so proximity was a bigger concern than price.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ThatsJustice1
50,Really interesting,"The tar pits contain asphalt and you could smell it. The largest pit is actively bubbling. The inside of the museum showed so many perfectly preserved bones of so many animals, mostly the saber-tooth cat!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/173cieraj
50,"Fascinating, First-Hand Experience of Ice Age History","It's rare you can see and smell history, but at the La Break Tar Pits you are literally there! Extremely well done exhibits within the museum bring the Ice Age to life and the several video presentations are also educational and entertaining. The wall of dire wolf skulls powerfully evokes the deadly attraction of the tar pits while the timeline of the La Brea ranch brings you into modern history and the evolution of the site. Very worthwhile seeing and great to combine with a visit to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art next door. We spent about 2 hours at the museum with our teen and didn't quite get through everything.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Workingindymom
50,Fascinating Natural History,"While I'd heard of the La Brea Tar Pits, I was under the impression that they were just touristy and not worth a visit. Was I wrong. The tar pits, not really tar but more like shallow goo, are located in a beautiful park like setting. You could picnic there and that would be wonderful but it is so much more. There are small lakes, one has replicas of a mastodon family and one is stuck in the mire. There are great explanations of how and why this happened and why this site is so extraordinary. One of the pits had scientists working in it. While this would be worth a trip, a smaller museum provides even more information and adds to the experience. There are replicas of animals whose skeletons were discovered, like a 1500 pound sloth, and actual skulls and skeleton parts. Scientists are working in a lab that is part of the museum and you can watch them. There is a theater with an entertaining family friendly show explaining the history of the La Brea Tar Pits with a guest appearance of a realistic sabre tooth tiger. Another theater features 3-D movies like Ice Age. Even the gift shop was a jewel. There was plenty of on street parking on a Saturday morning.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bge24
50,"Actually, we were thrilled!","It was my wife's dream to go to the tar pits and after 70 years we finally made it.We paid for parking at the adjacent lot ($15). It was good until 10 p.m. This enabled easy access and also access to the incredible LA County Museum of Art which is right next door.Plenty of indoor and outdoor things to see. This is still an active site with tar oozing out of the ground. Don't worry, sites are marked but stay in the trails. Inside is an superb museum. Over 5 million fossils have been recovered so far. We paid for a separate movie and that was good too. Ask for discount information if you are 62 or over or a vet.No on site dining so either pack a lunch or go next door to the art museum or go outside to any number of dining establishments.We spent about three hours touring the grounds and the museum before heading next store to the art museum. Check off a major bucket list item.The only negative is dealing with LA traffic, but f LA traffic is going to bother you, you may want to head to another state. LA is LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LodiWineBob
40,Remember Ice Age,"An interesting museum, situated on the place of a lake with asphalt bottom from Ice Age period.Here are exposed a lot of skeleton of Megatherium Americanum - some giant monkeys, measuring almost 6 meters, and having a weight of few tons.These monkeys came to drink water from this lake, and they died because the legs were fixed in the asphalt bottom.In the yard of the museum is a lake with some statues of ancient animals around it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y8837LLgabriela
40,2016,"Was traveling down Museum row, next to the LA County Art Museum an saw it. While the pits are known the museum has much more than that. The building itself is nice architecturally. It is still active in exploration of the pits and these are shown. The exhibits give a good overview of the environment that existed when they went in. It is a nice stop to make. Just remember that all of the tar still has much odor.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/933reeds
50,Fascinating view of the Ice Age,"It was interesting seeing the La Brea Tar Pits again after having been there 40 years ago when there were no fences around the tar pits and only a tiny museum.This place is amazing to see a large tar lake just feet away from Wilshire and yards away from 1000s of people in buildings. Tar is oozing out of the ground all over: in parking lot, the grass park area and areas marked off. Certainly there is a lot more tar in the area - wondering the effect on nearby building?The outside park area was free to wonder around but the parking lot was $15. You can walk around many of the larger tar pit pools / lakes and it’s amazing how so many giant mammoths came out of a tar pool that is relatively small! Each exhibit that great placards explaining what was found there and details of the history.Both outside near one of the tar pits as well as inside you see people working on excavating and cleaning what is a continuous project indefinitely.The museum is very interesting and not expensive. There are many large full size skeletons that were found in the tar pits; many smaller exhibits in cases; a movie; an outdoor atrium and a small gift shop. There is also an area where you see volunteers working to clean pieces found. You could spend as much or as little time as you wanted but I would say allow for an hour plus for the outside park area and the same for the inside.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AdvtrTrvlr
50,Fantastic exhibits!,"We caught the hop on hop off bus to the La Brea Tarpits. The tar is continually coming up, it’s fascinating to walk around the site and see it. The 3D film was excellent. You can see paleontologists digging outside for bones and inside others are searching through bones.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/791anitat
30,Interesting place and free,"Only worth an hour or so of your time. Quite an interesting historical area, but I thought the area needed a better presentaion.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AndrewKen
50,Very interesting,We had terrible jetlag and went for a walk very early morning to the Tar Pits. The museum doesn't open until 9.30 but the park is open all the time. It was really interesting to see the tar bubbling up through the ground. It is a very safe area with lots of joggers/dog walkers out early. We also visited the museum later in the day. That was good too to see the preserved animals and learn all about the history of the place. Small museum but great exhibits,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elsiemleedsUK
40,good museum for all ages,"over 3 million fossil dug from tar pits in the area, its very hands on experience for all ages, the price is reasonable, free for veterans and military. see the shows and tour all the grounds. you learn a lot about the ice age.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bigheavyq
50,Fascinating experience,"My grandson (age 7) and I were visiting my brother in LA and decided to go to the La Brea Tar Pits and Museum. I had no idea how much I would learn and how much I would enjoy it! It is absolutely fascinating. The park is well kept and you can stroll through the park for free. There are small areas in the park where the tar pits are coming to the surface (blocked off for safety reasons). You can also visit the large tar pit and several excavation pits.There is free parking and the cost to see the museum is inexpensive (free if you are an educator, $12 for seniors, $15 for adults, and I believe it was $7 for children).The museum is well worth the cost. There are a number of exhibits featuring saber tooth cats, dire wolves, sloths, and mammoths. You can also view people while they work in the paleontology lab cleaning fossils. A favorite for the children, and some adults, is the ""tar pull"" where you can try to pull a cylinder out of tar which allows you to feel how difficult it would be to get out of a tar pit.I highly recommend the La Brea Tar Pits park and museum. There is something for all ages and it is well worth the time and the cost.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stewartjl2017
50,All kids should see this,"A reminder that fossils aren't all from dinosaurs and that there are things to be learned even from tiny remains. The outside is a good space, you can see some bones in one pit, but the museum has beautiful specimens of several animals.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/reidt858
50,What's not to like about giant sloths and wooly mammoths?,"Excellent value museum right in the heart of the city. We were enthralled by the history lesson we received in a fun and entertaining way. Seeing the tar pits up close was fascinating, especially the active excavations that were happening outside but also the fossil lab inside. The museum is small and very accessible, so if you want a quick visit, you could do it in an hour to 90 minutes, or you can take your time exploring, add on the Titans 3D video (which we enjoyed) and spend two and a half hours there. You can enjoy the park outside, just watch out for the bubbling and gurgling tar!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cate13
40,"Unique site, asphalt pits & fossils discovered in them","I would recommend a quick visit to the tar pits if you're staying nearby or passing nearby. (I wouldn't necessary recommend going too far out of your way for a special visit...).The small museum contains several spectacular fossits of prehistoric fossils recovered from the asphalt pits. The museum also lay on free tours of the asphalt pits in the grounds - I would highly recommend taking one of these tours during your visit.The site is fairly small, you won't need more than a couple of hours for your visit. Also - please note it seems very popular with school groups and families with young children, so bear this in mind if you're easliy disturbed by youngsters running around!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stephensH3674DY
50,History in Ways You Never Imagined,"A museum can be dull, and lots of fossil bones laying around can be pretty boring. Toss in some bubbling tar pits of different sizes along with an excellent museum that explains it all, situated in a park with room to walk and roam and enjoy -- this has got to be a top-of-the-list for grown ups and children. Excellent family outing with something for the brain in the family as well as the fun smiley ones.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davebob123
50,Saber-toothed cats everywhere,"I had heard about the tar pits before and knew of their significance, but I must say that many of the small things at La Brea made the visit memorable. We were extremely impressed by the “excavated here” nature of many fossils, as well as their completeness and preservation (thanks to asphalt). We picked the ice age encounter with the Jim Henson-collaboration saber toothed cat, and it was worth very minute of it. We were just as impressed by the puppeteering skills displayed when Nibbles the baby saber toothed cat visited the kids. After you are done inside the museum, make sure you visit Project 23 to speak with the volunteers, and don’t miss the fossils at Pit 91 and the Observation Pit. If you keep walking towards the art center, you will also find C+M (coffee + milk) where you can wrap up your visit with some delicious (albeit a little pricy) baked goods.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MD_T0urist
40,Interesting view of prehistory,"A great place to take your kids or yourself if you are interested in paleontology. Well done exhibits show long gone fauna like saber-toothed cats and mastodons. Right next to the LACMA, which is an added bonus. Good parking too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/573Lisa_S_11573
40,A big hit with kids of all ages,I didn't know what to expect but it was an interesting stop on a busy day in LA. You can actually smell the tar pits as you get close. A must-see if you have ever been curious about Sabre- Tooth Tigers and similar creatures.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eastcoaster101
50,Revisiting La Brea Tar Pits Decades Later,Back in the 1980s I visited the La Brea Tar Pits. This time I marveled at the improvements. We especially loved the gardens in the middle of the museum. The koi fish stream and the beautiful lighting décor and the many plants and trees reminded me of the Washington DC Botanical Gardens. We sat on one of the benches and took it all in before returning to the many wonderful displays. There was something to do for all ages. Outside the bubbling tar pond was still amazing to look at. A trip beyond there to look at the archeological dig area was informative. All in all walking the grounds and museum was a delight.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Joestuffsda
40,Ice age in LA - fun!,Spent 2-3 hours with 9- and 12-year old. Enjoyed the exhibits and watched both shows - one 3D movie about ice age and another show with a life-size puppet that was cool. Nice park setting for a picnic or let the kids run. Buy tix for shows ahead of time for a discount. We bought a family membership that covered everything.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KCRidihalgh
40,Really interesting,Went here in our first morning which had started out overcast. Great insight into animals from a bygone era and it is staggering how many fossils they have taken from the tar.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/garypE558IX
20,Really poor value,"It cost us USD 49 for 2 adults, 1 student and 1 child to get into the museum. It’s great for really young kids with all the fossils but that’s all there really is there. It also gets you access to one small tar pit but the rest of the tar pits are open to the general public. Given you also have to pay for parking, I would skip the entry fee to the museum and just walk around the tar pits instead.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Didge432
50,One of the best little atteactions in California!,"This place must be the most underrated attraction in all of L.A.Go explore and see!It costs to go into the museum and to take the tour, but to just wander the park and explore is completely free.It's right next to LACMA, so makes a great way to break up exploring the bigger art museum, with some sunshine and air,Not quite fresh air, because tar pit, but still a ncie way to relax in the sun.If you do go into the museum, they offer a 45 minute tour of the excavation sites which is great, and super informative.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/troym375
50,Great place to go for a day during spring break,"The La Brea Tar Pits are a group of tar pits around which Hancock Park was formed in urban Los Angeles. Natural asphalt has seeped up from the ground in this area for tens of thousands of years.Take the option to purchase the 3D movie, Titans of the Ice Age.The display are very informative. I think my 12 year old nephew had the most fun poking at the gooey asphalt seeking up on the grass.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/123juney
50,Fabulous visit and tour,"We visited the tar pits on our recent holiday and enjoyed it greatly. The majority of the site is open to all at no cost, but we chose to pay for a tour and weren't disappointed.Guide was friendly and very informative, leading us around the grounds and pointing out a range of features of the site and explaining its history.We were very satisfied with our experience and would say this is a must if you have an interest in natural history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/685mickl
30,Interesting stop,The La Brea Tar Pits and Museum is a nice stop on the west side. It is in a park-like setting and close to other museums so you can spend several hours exploring in the same area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/buffalojim67
50,Late Afternoon at La Brea Tar Pits and Museum,"Enlightening and well worth the visit! Surprising to come to understand the tar pits and the history here. Good to see Titans of the Ice Age 3D early on during the tour. Definitely worth an afternoon. We unfortunately arrived around 3:30pm on a Wednesday. This left only about 1.5 hours before closing. And on Wednesdays, the next-door LA County Museum of Art (LACMA) is closed. There was a bit of a wait at the line at the regular entrance, and no wait for members. In retrospect, it would have been a good deal to simply buy a family membership in advance, online, and in this way get ""for free"" everything we paid for anyway, without the wait. That would have also covered a second visit, which we may very well do on our next visit to LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DavidW12935
40,Worth a visit,"I visited recently. Very interesting and informative. I did think that the museum was a bit small. We didn't do any of the shows, just the musuem and we got through it pretty quickly. The grounds outside of the museum were actually just as interesting. One complaint, parking is ridiculously expensive in the official lot. We were there less than an hour and a half and it was $16 to park. I know LA parking can be expensive, but this felt exorbitant.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DJ-Reviewer-One-Day
40,Worthwhile walking tour,"A family group went to visit the tar pits and museum one morning in mid-March. On-street parking was, surprisingly, free, and we walked the short distance to the entrance area. We decided to tour the museum before the grounds, and we found the museum to be interesting but relatively expensive. It was great to walk around the grounds and view the pits, although we would have appreciated more descriptive signage. The pits are right downtown LA, and near other museums. The pits can be smelly at times but the tour was worthwhile.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dougnorm
50,This is a must see in Los Angeles,"We compare the significance of this to the Terracotta Warriors in China, but in its own way. It is well set up for tourists, its facinating, educational and a credit to those that have established the facility. It is also free if you dont want to see the two shows that have been put together, if you can afford the shows and they are not expensive do them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HappyTraveller119
50,not at all what I Thought,Was a great time. Doesn't take that long to tour and was very informative. Low cost and great service and information.Was totally not what I had envisioned what the tar pits looked like.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CodyB1124
30,not really worth the money,perhaps i have lived here too long but it seems the tar pits are well almost the pits. the museum is okay but the mammoth and sabor tooth cat hydrolics are horrible and out of date. the pits have absolutely nothing in them at all and no one is telling you anything aka stories about the past and some of the written signs are repeated over and over....not a place i would go again and certainly not to pay full price for.......,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deandgeorge
40,Very unique experience,"Only one city in the entire world has this attraction, so if you visit Los Angeles, you really should take the time to walk the area, even if you do not have time to enter the museum or watch the excavations around the park. Columbian mammoths walked near Wilshire Blvd. 20,000 to 40,000 years ago.The remains of the animals have been found by scientists since the late 1800's. Inside the museum you see fossils of saber tooth cats, wolves, cloths and mastodons. I enjoyed the 3-D movie Ice Age! It is shown every 30 minutes and you get your time slot when you enter. By the way, parking is very expensive! Go early and get a meter on the street for a 2 hour visit. If you are with a small child who is too frightened, head out to the LACMA art museum next door! Or drive down the street to the Petersen Automotive Museum. Make a full day and visit The Grove (Farmer's Market) too! Mid-Town Los Angeles (Hancock Park area) has many interesting places to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hildmat
50,Besides the obvious artifacts--wonderful history,The exhibits tell of the history of LA besides just displaying skeletons of extinct animals. This location is living history not to mention the geology.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chestpain
50,Deeper insight than expected,"We visited the La Brea Tar Pits and Museum and were surprised to discover there was way more there than we expected. We wandered around the outdoor pits and read the descriptions of what had happened there so long ago, ending at the very large pit opposite the museum entrance. The large pit/pond was particularly interesting, as the odor of gas was rather strong and the bubbling of the gas being released was fun to watch. Inside the museum there were numerous fossils on display of animals which had become trapped and perished in the tar, and whose bones were well preserved in it. The displays were very informative and were further enhanced by volunteers whose purpose was to engage people and answer questions. The professional staff was also very willing to share information with curious museum guests. The most striking aspect was the glassed-in fossil lab, where visitors could watch museum staff working with fossil bones, cleaning and preserving them, close up right in front of us. There was also an interactive exhibit where you could feel how strong the pull of the sticky tar was to see what it might be like to have become trapped in it. All in all, a very fun and interesting experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/patluck
50,Was Inspired !,I have lived in Los Angeles County my whole life and had never been to La Brea Tar Pits until yesterday. Was a great time ! Took my adult children as well and they equally enjoyed. I found the displays interesting and even more so the walk around the park was fun - seeing the actual tar pits. I found the diversity of life from the ages to be inspiring ! Lots of nice places around to have lunch and parking is a breeze - $15 on site.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/375robo
40,Great museum and amazing history for young and old,"Last visit to this location was well over a decade ago. Arriving at 10 am on a holiday weekend we began with a self guided trip around the exterior tar pit that is still bubbling!! Located around the perimeter, you can learn the history of this amazing open pit of natural oozing tar. We decided to take in the on site museum and each of us commented how well the exhibits are displayed and how engaging they are to all. $16/USD is the regular price for admission. There are discounts available for seniors. large groups and others, check the web site and Groupon.com for potential discounts. The museum is a treasure trove of actual remains that have been excavated from various tar pits in the immediate vicinity. The history of the world from 38,000 years ago until today is displayed in a wonderful panoramic time table that is easy viewing. We moved on to another exhibit that showed men working in a tar pit in the early 1900's , uncovering bones from a prehistoric time. Another display indicated between 1913 and 1915 over one MILLION bones had been uncovered! WOW!. The dire wolf alone has over 400 skulls on display. As we walked through the museum, we reached one of my personal favorites, the examining room. Here experts are work with actual fossils, bones and other remains from one of the tar pits. The experts are painstakingly cleaning and separating each tiny article. They do this in a room that is glass sided to the museum so you are face to face with them as they work. Every person young and old can watch this experts working. Small signs indicate what each person is working on. This day, two experts were sorting through very small remains and were using electron microscopes to do their work. One microscope was connected to a large TV monitor so we could see exactly what the expert saw! Truly amazing work. There are several Woolly Manmouth displays with the overwhelming giant tusks attached to the skeletal frame. Thre are several ""see and touch"" exhibits including one that allows the visitor to feel how much strength it takes to escape the tar pits (Tar Pull) and another that is marked ""please touch"", this is a large bone from an ice age sloth! One of my other favorite displays that is often overlooked is a saber tooth tiger. At first you see the tiger facing you as it would have looked when alive. Within seconds, it changes to just the image of the bones and teeth as it would have been found in the tar pits. Ask an employee to held you find this fun and educational exhibit. In the center of the museum is a beautiful and lush atrium complete with Koi fish ponds and waterfalls. This a great location to take photos of you and your group. There are two theaters inside the museum, Encounter theater is a Saber tooth Cat puppet in a production named "" Ice Age Encounters"" ( Fri - Sun only) and the other theater is a 3D Theater featuring 3D movie experiences. (Check the web site for times and features), Both theaters have an additional fee that is not included with your museum entrance. On street metered parking is available in the area. Come enjoy this amazing wonderful place in the heart of Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jerseybob175
50,First Murder in LA... Dire wolves!,I think this spot is fascinating. The fossil that they have uncovered here are so cool. This is the site of the first apparent murder recorded!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnFallonstudio
40,"A must visit, especially with children!","I am so glad I visited the LA Brear Tar Pits and Museum! It was an extraordinary opportunity to watch tar bubbling to the surface and scientists painstakingly work with large and micro fossils, and the amazing collection of Ice age fossils collected right in the heart of LA! The free guided tour was outstanding--- our guide, a spunky knowledgeable young woman, really helped us appreciate what the Tar Pits were all about! I spent close to 3 hours at the site----- each minute was worth it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sarina14
30,Stay outside skip the inside,My husband had wanted to go to the tar pits as a child. He finally got his wish. The outdoor pit trail was the highlight. Try to get on a tour as the guide makes a difference. The actual museum seems so modern outside but dated like the natural history museum diorama exhibits if the 70’s.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/706amyk
50,Brilliant to visit with the kids,"This was an unexpected highlight of LA, with the adults and kids enjoying it equally. Great location close to LACMA and Petersons Car Museum too, which made for a great day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LJM784
40,Very Cool!,I've heard about the La Brea Tar Pits virtually al of my life and was so pleased to finally get to visit. Parking was just outside the facility and cost $14. We were so glad to see gated parking as we had all of our stuff in our SUV as we hadn't checked in to our hotel yet.Touring here is pretty much free-form as you can walk the grounds and/or walk through the museum. We did both and learned so much!Inside the museum are lots of exhibits of bones they've retrieved from the pits. Absolutely incredible that they've found over a million specimens!So glad we got to finally come here!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MNM1011
50,Fascinating,We didn’t have time to do museum but outside exhibits are fascinating and free. History of this area interesting. Plan for an hour just to walk outside. Even found a Tar spot coming up through the grass.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Karinmch
40,interesting,"Very informative. Join the tour to learn more about dinosaurs and the tar pits. Actual dig sites can be seen although we didn't have the chance to do hands-on digging, as stated in some articles about the park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GwenR88
50,Very educational,"My husband and I took our 5-year-old son and 8-year old daughter to visit the museum and tar pits. We all learned a lot and had a great time on our visit. We spent about an hour touring the museum itself. Our 5-year-old tired a bit and was most interested in the animatronic displays and displays where there were bones to touch. Our 8-year-old seemed to take in a ton of information and loved watching the people at work in the fossil lab.Walking around the pits outside was also interesting. We unfortunately didn't check all the tour times when we first arrived and by the time we wrapped up inside we had missed the only Project 23 (their active dig) tour of the day which I imagine would have been very interesting. That aside we started our own self-tour after lunch and ended up running into one of the tour groups that had started at the top of the hour and got to jump in with them for their last couple of stops. The guide was very informative and added a lot of deeper context to what we were seeing. Though each pit has numerous informative signs making it easy to gain a lot of knowledge on a self-guided tour. Keep an eye out watching the grounds as pits of asphalt can creep up in unexpected places. There were several cones out in the grass marking areas to use caution when walking!We were able to gain free entry to the museum through the ASTC Travel Passport as a result of out membership to the Science Center back home. We noted all visitors were able to visit the outdoor pits without paying the museum entry fee. Though the museum itself was a highlight and would have been well worth the fee. We opted to also check out both the Ice Age Encounters (an educational session about the tar pits, their history and the work being done there along with an encounter with a life-size saber tooth cat puppet) as well as the 3D film. Our kids enjoyed both but there was some repetition in the background information so it probably isn't necessary to visit both. The woman at the ticket window recommended the Ice Age Encounters for younger kids, though I will say that the saber tooth cat is very large and close to the audience which could be frightening for younger or sensitive for kids.There isn't a cafe or place for lunch in the museum, though there is a strip of restaurants just around the corner (we stopped to grab some food mid-visit.) The grounds are beautiful with plenty of places to picnic in nice weather which would be a lovely option if you plan ahead.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sharonmE6679PW
50,Uniquely L.A. experience,"When most think of L.A., they think of movie stars, swimming pools, rockers, and waiters biding their time until their big break (by the way... would you like to see this screenplay I've been working on? It's a hilarious rom-com set in a Los Feliz restaurant with a waiter who wants to write movies, and a hostess who wants to be an actress...).But my favorite, only-in-L.A., attraction is the La Brea Tar Pits (which, as I understand it, is Spanish for ""the tar pits tar pits""). Nowhere else that I know of has an open paleontological dig site in the heart of the city. The best part is that the real attraction -- the open tar pits and dig sites -- are free and open to the public.The museum inside is educational, but it is relatively small and may not be worth the price of admission. We were able to gain entry through our local museum's membership reciprocal program, but I probably wouldn't have paid to get in.There is also paid parking on site, but I have never had trouble finding a metered spot on one of the surrounding streets.Whether you go into the museum or walk the beautiful grounds, the tar pits are a fantastic glimpse into a prehistoric L.A. one where giant sloths and coyotes and horses and camels converged -- and where some found a bounty of food and water, and where others met their doom in the quagmire.And you realize that in L.A., maybe the story hasn't changed -- only the players.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jrryager
50,Amazing,Fascinating chance to experience archeology first hand. Amazing fossils and skeletons on display. Very interesting to see tar pits in person and to understand the prehistoric past if LA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/98haleyj
50,free viewing of dig sites and other,"recommend trying this for the free sites, like pit 91, you can see the bones from dinosaurs, etc. no, need to pay",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/douglaswilliamm
50,More than a just a tar pit!,"I last visited La Brea Tar Pits in 1986. Since then, several more tar pits have been exposed to visitors, along with an amazing modern museum about the fossils of animals, plants, etc that have been found in the tar pits. We also watched volunteers sorting through dirt for micro fossils, tiny parts of plants, seeds, jaw bones of tiny animals or birds. Amazing day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MomMom3
50,Wonderful,Glad for an extra day in LA to visit this famous site. We weren’t sure what to expect but were very impressed with the museum & ongoing research. This was a highlight of our trip!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlaskaLH
30,A Tar Pitty :-),"The Tar Pits and Museum are pretty much two different entities. The Pits are free to visit, even though you don't see much other than ...well a pit. The museum is where all the info is. Quite touristy in my opinion. You enter and the first they they do is take pictures of you which are then photoshop'd to make it look like you are standing in a pit or are scared looking at prehistoric animals. Plenty of bones found in the pits with timelines etc. A few animatronic displays which can be scary to toddlers or little kits (like the mammoth which moves its head back and forth and then all of a sudden submits a loud ""mammoth"" sound...They also have a 3 D movie theatre and an amimatronic/people show. Is it worthwhile to go . Hard to say. It was less than what we expected being interested in more in-depth info.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gcto20
30,Worth a quick visit,Not as interesting as we hoped. The museum has several displays of prehistoric animals that were recovered from the pits and there is an area in the museum where you can watch people working on various items that have been recovered from the sits. The number and variety of animals displayed is relatively small. You can walk around outside and see several tar pits but the large one in front of the museum is the most interesting. Plan on about an hour to see everything.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tishcitric
40,Small but interesting experience,"It was a very interesting experience, we could roam the gardens with the open-air tar pits for free. There were families doing picnics and dancing! To go inside the museum you have to pay admission so we got the movie package. The museum itself is very small, but it was great to see the fossils and the people working at the lab. The movie was amazing! We had a good time here. Expect to spend about 2 hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/777_Carla
40,It’s alright. 40 minutes walkthrough,It’s an alright spot to walk if you have additional time. The ticket is 15 for adults and 12 for students with valid ID. It’s about the history of oil well in 1913-1915 at that location and fossils that have been dogged up.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/301ling
30,Chevy Chase/ Clark Griswald,"Kind of a been there/seen it experience. We just wanted to stop quickly, found street parking, dashed over and took a look. We didn't do the museum but if you want the fossils, you better since there isn't much to see/ read on the outside. Kind of brief stop-- worked for us.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emilyl97
50,Amazing one of a kind museum!,"Our party of 5 visited on 3/7/18. When we parked our car, there was a traffic cone labeled “Sticky” in the adjoining parking space. You could see the tar oozing out of this hole in the parking lot!We purchased our tix online, and scheduled a time to see the 3D movie. We arrived just in time for the start of the movie, which tells the history of the Tar Pits. Movie is well done and very informative; suggest you view it prior to touring the pits and the museum!We then joined the “Excavator Tour”, which is a guided tour of the tar pits. You start our at the original tar pit, which is mainly water with some tar seeping into it. We then viewed several small areas where the tar is seeping directly out of the ground. We then visited the major excavation which work is on hold until summer. You can see bones sticking out of the tar.You can then walk through the museum to see many of the specimens they have recovered, cleaned and cataloged. Gift shop is run of the mill, you can buy replicas is specimens.Tips: wear comfortable shoes and clothing . Parking is $15/car. Buy tickets online at $20/adult. No food service beyond vending machines.Definitely a must see for your favorite scientist or archeologist!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DCbikerman
40,Interesting way to see Ice Age artifacts preserved,"We can here to see all of the amazing preserved animal remains from the legendary tar pits. Cool to see the active tar pits outside as you walk around, and the remains inside in the museum. Its a nice way to spend a couple of hours with kids, and its rare to see all of the animal remains from thousands of years ago so well preserved from the tar pits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dmorris2112
50,Excellent venue,"I find it interesting that since ""La Brea"" means tar so the name of the venue is Tar Tar Pits and Museum! Yeah, I get amused easily!Anyway, I haven't been back for at least 12-15 years so it was a whole new fresh experience for me. Plus, I brought kids who were interested in the subject so that was a bonus. The main facilities contains results of continuing research on the tar pits around the property. The exhibits displays numerous specimens and plant life that were trapped in the sticky stuff. If you are looking for a dinosaur exhibit, this place is not it. However, it offer an excellent insight in a world where men began to dominate. Everyone should visit this place at least once.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jt99941
50,Fascinating trip into the past,"The Tar Pits contain the fossil remains of many species, not a few of them, such as mastodons, woolly mammoths, saber-toothed tigers, large sloths, Yesterday’s camels, dire wolves, etc, trapped for up to 40,000 years. The museum offers a very useful introductory film and a number of helpful displays. Outside you get to see some of the work in progress, as fossils continue to be dug up. This is a must-visit attraction.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/operalover939
40,Interesting geology in middle of city but high parking price,"This is an interesting geologic oddity right in the middle of Los Angeles. We were there after the museum closed but walked around the different asphalt pits where they have found a lot of fossils. It was really interesting. There are little pools of asphalt in the grass as well so you can touch it if you want to, exercise caution if you do this because it is asphalt and will not come out of clothes or shoes. The pricing was outrageous though. We were there for 55 minutes on a Sunday after 5PM and parking was $16.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jfranz2018
40,A fascinating trip to the ice age,"A truly wonderful place. Carefully thought out. The gift shop could have had more science toys and items and a better selection of ice age animals on the T shirts. The tarpits themselves are fascinating, and I love the fact that the site is a public park. (Several community kids’ sports clubs were starting practice as I left. No danger of them or their balls falling in the sticky tar though - they are surrounded by big strong fences).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PatriciaToronto
40,You Should Do It,"A working museum displaying 10-40,000 year old fossilized remains of Mammoths, Dire Wolves, Mastodons and extinct birds. Also available a 30 minute video of the historyand workings of the museum. Well done and worth the time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GiseppeGord
40,Good education values for our grandchildren,"We came here on a drizzly rainy dayThere is no crowd and can find a parking spot easily ( after paying 15 dollars)The admission for adults is 15 dollars and when you want to watch the 3D movies there is an extra charge for 5 dollarsThere is a discount for senior 3 dollars offThe movie about the history of the museum ,how the pit was being discovered,and about fossils,extinct animals,surprisingly the word dinosaurs was not mentioned even onceThere is a see through glass where you can watch the volunteers,and technicians doing microscopic cleaning and searching of the soil samplesOn the outside there is an open pit under excavation for demonstrationOne can smell the tar originating from the surface of the pondBecause it was raining,the outside garden was closedThe tar pit was a dead trap for the prehistoric Animal,plus elements of nature,and human beings led to present development of the museumThe full scale reconstruction of the animals and the models are well doneIf it was not the rain, We could have stayed another half an hour or hour longer",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/allanamyt2016
50,You must go if you are a fossil nut or biologist,"Parking is pricey - $15. Entrance is pricey but this is an LA must see. Especially if you love dinosaurs, fossils, ice age animals. It is really fascinating. You should budget at least 3 hours here and definitely take the guided tour. It is included with ticket price.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HungryDave1
50,Checked off the bucket list,"I’ve always wanted to visit the La Brea Tar Pits and it was our first stop in L.A. $15 for parking. $15 for an adult ticket and $5 for the 30 min 3D movie. I enjoyed it & I think my husband did too even though it wasn’t on his must do list. Didn’t take us much time. We walked the museum, watched the movie and viewed all the pits in less than 2 hours. FYI, You can visit the pits without paying for the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bprice602
40,"Well curated, surprise in the city","We spent a pleasant couple of hours in the heart of LA exploring this natural phenomena. Knowledgable guides and good exhibits made understanding easy. A few of the exhibits are a bit dated (the Saturn V rocket is no longer cutting-edge), but the ongoing research is interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/actranslation

50,"Enjoyed the Tar Pits, the museum was amazing!","This was different from what I expected. I expected to see bubbling tar pits but instead they are more like puddles of tar and in some cases appear dormant. However, it was no less interesting and reading about the geological history and evolution was very informative. There are tours available, though there are easy to read and follow explanations at each exhibit. I did find the museum to be particularly interesting. The exhibits of reconstructed prehistoric life were fascinating. These included dinosaurs, birds and fore runners of some of today's fauna. Each accompanied with its information and history. One of the particular points of interest is the time line which denotes the place in time of life and extinction for each of the species. All in all less then two hours is needed, $15. to park and $15. to enter. There is a gift shop worth stopping in as you leave.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CATTSAR
50,Very Unique,"We have visited in the past including the museum, which is somewhat pricey but worth it. But you can visit all the sites outside the museum for free, which we did this most recent time because we didn't have the grandkids in tow.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/liarsnf

50,Excellent. Trip,"This was an amazing trip. We did the 3D cinema tour then went on the free tour to learn more about the bones found in the oil pits of the animals,such as the woolly mammoth and the sabre toothed tiger after theIce Age. If you are interested in this you will find it fascinating. More so the pit outside, where it demonstrates how the ashphalt and methane gas can erupt into pools. The artefacts are also well displayed in the Museum. Worth a visit. There is a shop and toilets, but no cafe. Also if you like art galleries there is one next door.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DebbieQ937
40,"Cool, informative","I had lived in LA a long time and it was only on a recent return visit that I discovered the museum portion of the La Brea Tar Pits. It was great. The exhibits were highly educational, and I enjoyed learning about the history of this area and development of the museum itself. In its own way, its very specific to California and specific period of time when the Tar Pits existed - it makes it unique and not your sisal hue overview of prehistory. I also enjoyed watching the researchers sift through ""micro bones"" on the other side of a glass research area. Probably the 3D movie is fun too, but I didn't want to add on to the cost of admission.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/profits101

40,Interesting historical site,The La Brea Tar Pits was one of the things on our list to see while in CA and we were not disappointed. Amazing how many skeletons they have found since they started excavating. The museum is arranged in a very interesting manner and the talks very informative. Definitely a historic site not to be missed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/swtraveler15
40,"Has not Changed in a Decade, but unique place to visit","I love the saber tooth cat and the la brea tar pits. I returned after going there as a school kid and found everything to be the same. For those who do not wish to pay for admission to the museum, the outside section is free. You can smell and see real tar pits and a fossil dig location.

50,One of the Best Attactions in LA,"The Tar Pits are located on Wilshire Blvd. in the heart of LA. Hard to imagine dinosaurs roaming this area, but they did. The tar pits still exist in the park that surrounds the museum. The pits are still under active excavation. In the museum you can see complete skeletons, animated displays and workers cleaning and restoring bones. There is paid parking, but we luckily found free parking on the street.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BluRavdriver
40,Interesting and you smell the tar!,"This is a very interesting and educational place. You actually do see the tar bits bubbling , and you can even smell it nearby.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/9_Travelbug26
50,Great place to spend a few hours,"Great Museum, great displays. Very informative visit. The car park is $15 for the day. Entry to the museum is $15 per person. The tar pits themselves are free. The park would be a great place for a picnic but we took the 15min walk to the farmers market for a great lunch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fury-ice
40,Small but informative,"Not bad museum, but don't expect anything spectacular. My kids were kind of disappointed with it. Lots of gooey tar pits with gasses bubbling up from the tar constantly. You can see a few open excavations where paleontologists are still working 90+ years after the initial discovery, hang out by a pond that bubbles ferociously as methane and tar rise to the surface. There are flags in place highlighting specific bones that the paleontologists are digging up. A guide will explain to you what type of bone and animal it pertained to. My favorites were the ground sloth, ancient bison, mammoth and dire wolves. There are also nice fossils of the sabre-toothed cat, american lion, and mastadon. It is a small, but informative museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/e_Williams191
50,A Must See,"What a cool museum. When we first got out of our car we could smell the tar and we knew we were in the Tar Pits. It set the stage for our visit. We enjoyed the museum here with lots of fossils, displays and explanation. The mammoth is truly mammoth: stand beneath its huge tusks and look up. Check out the Fossil Lab and watch the trained volunteers separate its bitsy fossils like insect fossils from the dirt and sand that they were in. Also, in the tar display, try to pull the metal rod out of the tar - it's tough and you then can see why huge animals like the mammoth could get caught in it.But the best part is the tour of the grounds to see the tar still oozing out of the ground. Here is an open pit that is being worked in the summer and fossils are still being pulled out of it. Then there are the huge crates of material that they took out of the ground when the parking lot for the LACMA was being built. What a treasure trove of fossils.I've always wanted to see the La Brea Tar Pits and this visit exceeded my expectations.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NancyF406
50,One of the requirements for visiting LA,This unique place is a great day of any LA trip. Walk the grounds and absorb the aromas - you can imagine the scene with live animals trapped.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jonamo9638
50,Adored this place!,"Add this to your MUST do list in LA! As an archaeology addict, this place was on my list from the get go - and it exceeded my expectations. Exceptionally well run, it provides a great experience - you're in the middle of LA, surrounded by the modern world, but at the Tar Pits you are pulled back in time. From the still active pits, to the well laid-out and interactive exhibits in the museum - I could've spent all day there easily! If you were like my dad & sister (not so much archaeology addicts), it can also be done well in a couple of hours. You can also view the live digs going on at the site - the density of fossils found, and still being excavated, is mind-boggling. Souvenir shop is decent as well. There's nice, secure parking on site - can't remember if you had to pay, but if we did, it was minimal. If I ever return to LA, I will definitely make a return trip here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ambers206
40,Interesting bit of history in the heart of the city,Visited here with the 11 year old and 8 year old and thought it was great. The air conditioned modern museum was a great escape from the heat. Their are open oozing tar pits in the parkland. Good way to spend a few hours and reasonably priced.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kyliem319
50,Loved it!,I was amazed by the whole thing! It's right in the city but does not feel like it at all. The sheer number of animals etc that have been trapped by these pits is overwhelming!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jonseyo
40,Interesting inside and out,"We saw the 25 minute film first, which gave you a nice overview of what the museum and pits were all about. The museum had some great displays of skeletal remains that were found in the pits...mastodons, mammoths, saber tooth cats, sloths... plus a demonstration of how these creatures got sucked into the tar (asphalt) and couldn’t get out.Outside, you can visits some of the pits that are still being worked. There is one that is a display only that shows the remains of many creatures just piled on top of each other.I found it all very interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulah42
40,You can see a lot without even going inside,"Though the museum is well worth the entrance fee, as it contains the reconstructed remains of the many giant animals that died in the pits, even just walking the grounds is quite interesting. There are displays at several open pits as well as interpretive signs and sometimes you can see active excavation at work.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/123JessicaH
50,Very Interesting!,Visiting the LA area on a business trip and decided to check out some of the LA offerings. Wow what an interesting and educational place. Admission during the weekdays is $15.00 and a 3D movie was an extra $5.00. Totally worth all of it! The only negative was the smell of tar while walking around was pretty strong but faired way better than the animals did hundreds/thousands of years ago! Wish I would have had my family with me to enjoy it as well. Highly recommend this place!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NCSTREETDOC
50,Not enough time .....,I love this stuff but due to the incompetence of the hop on hop off bus I only had 45 minutes and the very informative 3D film was 25 minutes so not much time to do this amazing place and the dedicated scientific researches justice.Visitors can watch what is done with the finds via the glass bowl they work in.The displays are excellent even though I could just walk by.Give yourself loads of time you will not regret it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cientje21

50,Fascinating museum and attraction,"Great attraction for adults and kids alike, with lots of interaction. You see the tar pits outside without having to pay anything but would recommend paying the reasonable entrance fee to see the museum and all the artefacts. There is a great souvenir shop and there are good toilet facilities. You can get a coffee but could be improved with a proper cafe. However there are plenty of places to eat around the attraction.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/429lynneg
20,Nothing special,Outdoor exhibits are not particularly interesting but if you are at LA MOCA its worth the walk through.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elfox8
40,Natural History in the middle of the city,"Wow - I had no idea that prehistoric wonders are so easily accessible. Right next to the grounds of LACMA is a wonderland of still bubbling tar pits. The didactic materials at the pits and the directional signage are so helpful and fascinating. The museum itself was closed when we visited but we enjoyed wandering through the grounds just imagining them before a city was built around it. There is an adjacent parking lot for $15, but there is sometimes street parking off Wilshire. Museum admission would be an additional cost. There is an interesting Pleistocene plant garden and a great view from the plaza atop the museum, where you can also look down into a rainforest-like exhibit even when the museum is closed. This would be a great spot for kids to run off steam, as there are sloping hills and curving pathways.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CreateConnects
40,Inexpensive and Interesting Place To Visit,Visited this place with family. We had a fine time and learned a lot. Very interesting museum. The exhibits are first rate. Is not expensive and does not take long to see. Plenty of parking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sandopdx
30,"Good, but pricey and bad location.","The tar pits themselves are fascinating. The museum is cool, too. They do a good job and the things they've found in those pits will amaze you. I've docked a couple of stars for bad location and price. I realize the tar pits are where they are and there's not a thing anyone can do about it! But they are still a bit of a pain to get to. Traffic is always thick in L.A. and streets a bit narrow. Not their fault, but still took away from the experience. Price was a bit steep for what it is. It's $15 just to park! Then it was an additional $76 for museum entrance and 3-D movie for family of 5. So $100 total for what ends up being about a 2 hour thing. Kind of steep in my book. We saw a lot of groups of elementary age school kids there on tours. I couldn't help but feel like we were subsidizing quite a few things by paying our high entrance fees. If you're a huge nature/history buff, it's worth it. If not, you might want to pass on this.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DljUtah
40,Interesting,"We stopped by while on our way to dinner. About $15 per adult. We were told it would take 30' to visit it - which was all the time we had. It took us 20' to see pretty much all with sufficient pauses. The potential is there for a superb museum worth $30 for 2 adults, but it needs renovation and expansion.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J6185HLwilliama
40,Interesting,Very well done. Unique place. Much better than expected. Beautiful grounds and museum. The pits themselves were well presented and explained,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lewayneg
30,Informative,The pits are in a nice park like setting. There are paved sidewalks and signs all around the outdoor area that you could access for free. The museum we thought was a bit pricey for what little was in there but we understand it also funds the pits themselves to preserve them. The coolest part was seeing the big crates of asphalt pulled from pits nearby that were being cleared to put in a structure. The excavation of one create showed a little bit about how they remove the bones. We liked that we could see the scientists inside the museum cleaning bones found in the excavations. This was an informative visit and we were glad we stopped to see it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NVtoSF
50,Probably our favorite thing we did in LA.....,"Absolutely fascinating and so sad. The fact that they are still excavating and finding fossils is incredible in itself. Displays in the museum are nice w/ a lot of docents helping to explain things--mainly for children but will take the time to answer questions fr/ adults. Wandering the grounds is amazing and seeing one of the pits ""up close and personal"" is well worth the admission.The only real issue we had was w/ parking. Those in charge of the parking lot randomly choose to close it when they feel like it whether there are a dozen spots available or not so we circled twice and finally forced them to open the lot b/c we could see spaces open. The lame explanation given was that they had limited parking and did not want to over burden the lot (if a giant parking complex downtown can keep up w/ how many spaces are open then I would think a surface lot of about 100 spaces could figure out how to do it). Even a sign at the entrance that spaces were open at the LACMA complex would be helpful but instead just cones across the entrance and people waving you away. If you can find a place to park then by all means visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tencatdaddy
30,Ok,"A must see when in LA, but the outdoor tar pits leave a bit to be desired, not quiet like in the movies, some great exhibits in the museum. Have a walk around for free and then decide if you want to pay to go in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M5107RNmichaelc
50,Amazing Place,"I've been to LA a number of times over the years. This time visited the La Brea Tar Pits and Museum. Incredibly fascinating place. The museum is comprehensive and informative. You can walk around the grounds for free - and there's a lot to see. I highly recommend it, especially for families.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChuckR916
50,Great Visit!,"La Brea Tar Pits was a great time for our family (kids are 4 and 7). There is a great 3D movie that sets the stage for the rest of the visit and the museum is very approachable for young and old. Our visit last just about two hours, including the movie, walking the museum, and visiting various outdoor stops including Project 23 and the Observation Pit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoshInChicago
40,Beautiful and educational,"We really enjoyed this museum, the collection was really educational and beautifully displayed. There was a tar lake and green space outside of the museum to walk around and explore. However, street parking was difficult - we were in a time crunch, so bit the bullet and paid $15 to park in the nearby lot for one hour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SatChild
50,Great 1/2 Day Park,"Wonderful park that you can either do on your own or with a docent guide. Loved seeing the excavation sites and learning about how they excavate that area. The museum was also nice, but enjoyed the excavation sites more. Worth the visit and there are some restaurants next to the museum in case you want to do lunch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/232HollyW
50,Fantastic To Visit,"While on tour of LA several summers ago, I slipped away from the Tour & took a personal trip to ""La Brea Tar Pits"". As a former Biology Teacher, I was fascinated to actually be where I taught about in so lesson plans. Because I only had a short time before I had to re-join the main Tour Group, I didn't get to see everything. The fossils included Sabertooth Cats, Dire Wolves, Bison, Horses, and a nearly intact Mammoth Skeleton plus many more. The fossils date back as old as 35,000 to 40,000 years ago. I hope to get back for a longer visit sometime in the future. Anyone interested in science or with any type of brain needs to see this exhibit when visiting Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeorgeH-LI_NY-ExPat
50,Great place!,"Interesting, fun, beautiful location, great staff. We had a great time and learned a lot. This is well worth the time and the money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/monab326
40,Good place to take your kids and explore,Seemed to me that there was plenty of interactive displays and things to see for kids as well as the parents. Tar pit was not what I expected but was still interesting to see. Volunteers were knowledgeable and helpful. Recommend buying tickets in advance to save some time waiting in line to get in. Parking garage next to the tar pits was handy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Richard9H
40,Worth a Visit,"We didn’t go into the museum, however just walking around the park was great. It is free just walk the grounds and it amazing to see the tar pits and read the stories on what they have found. Certainly worth a visit if you are looking to fill in a couple of hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jreimer4551
40,Attraction unique to Los Angeles. Take the tour!,"Only four locations in the USA have tar pits, and this is the only one accessible from a city. If you've never been before, take the 25 minute excavator's tour, where a guide will show you the important spots on the site, as well as NEW tar formations as the area is constantly changing. Admission only required to the museum, so only pay if you wish to tour the exhibits. The museum is not large, but does have some great examples of the skeletons of extinct animals pulled from the tar pits. Good for a couple hours visit. If you bring little ones, make sure they do not touch the extremely sticky tar slowly oozing from the ground in different spots of the park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/814ianb
50,Awesome experience,"A piece of history and lot to learn. Excellent if you interested in fossils and paleontology.Do plan ahead about parking. Roadside at the back is also good option , $1.75 for 4 hours",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Traveller_mastana
50,THis is real.......... So cool,So i saw the tar pits in a movie and thought oh it's cool it's a hollywood set. WRONG. this is real and it's so cool. The history behind it is also worth the tour. Take it all in.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shannono139
40,Poor Cousin,"We were looking for something to do and happened upon the tar pits which are just near the Farmers Market. With the obvious money spent on the Art Museum next door, it's obvious the Historical Tar Pits don't get the same love. It was interesting to walk around, but after getting slugged $12 to park, we decided not to go another $72 ($12 each) to go into what looked like a pretty small museum. What we did see was good but would've been obviously enhanced with museum entrance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sickaworkin
40,pretty interesting but small,"Just looking for something to do we never did, and this fit the bill. Was an interesting area with lots of cool small exhibits, and a nice walk around the park. Park is free, exhibits are not. Not sure the price is worth thte small amount of exhibits, but i guess it is worth doing once.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mikesI6999GK
40,Interesting Displays,"The tar pits and museum were very interesting. It is amazing what they have found in the tar. The museum had some good exhibits highlighting the extinct wildlife which roamed the area. I recommend a visit,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PBM2010
40,Very interesting displays,"Interesting things to see, inside and out. We were there 2 hours , still didn't see everything. We liked the timeline that showed when animals were flourishing and when they went extinct.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/texasgal1260
50,Great place!,I’ve always wanted to visit this place. We arrived just before the last Excavator Tour started but chose not to join it since we did not have a lot of a time. It would probably have been more informative. You can actually walk around the park and see everything except the Observation Pit without paying the entrance fee but you would miss out on everything inside the museum.The parking lot was full so we parked in the LACMA underground parking which was perfect on a hot day.Highly recommend going!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melindag386
40,Good time!,We really enjoyed this stop! It took us almost 2 hrs as 30 min was spent seeing the 3-d movie. It was interesting and very well laid out. We did street parking (way cheaper).,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cdandoy
50,History frozen in time (and tar),"This was my second visit to La Brea Tar Pits- the first being on my last visit to LA some 33years ago after seeing a David Attenborough programme about them.This place is simply unique in the quality of the preservation of the animals and plants that got entombed in the tar (actually, it’s asphalt or bitumen, not tar which is a man made substance). Here you can learn in intricate detail what beasts, birds and insects roamed the area long before man. You can even watch scientists unpicking bones in a round glass sided lab, and join tours explaining in even greater detail how the Tar Pits came about and their relevance and ongoing work today.I highly recommend a half day visit to this amazing attraction.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MalcolmC793
40,You Have to Make This Fun,"Took a school party to this venue. The dinosaurs are fun, the kids may well get tar on their clothes and the exhibits are interesting but the docents are weary. Seemingly no interest in children and no idea how to engage or make learning fun. What a dour bunch. It is worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelsG3005BB
50,Must See For Everyone at Least Once.,"The La Brea Tar Pits are such a big part of the history of California. This is a comprehensive history lesson both interactive and entertaining, for kids and adults. It's a bit old school in its presentation (kids used to computers may find some of the exhibits quaint) but after you've visited you will have a complete understanding of the history of dinosaurs in California. It's a wonderful place to visit, and to bring kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eboosler
50,La Brea Tar Pits and Museum,This museum is also an active site for retrieving Dinosaur bones from the Tar Pits located on the same site as the museum. This is always worth a visit. It is located right next to LACMA art museum.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wa6flr
50,Incredible insight into the past,This place surely encompasses a great vision into the past. The exhibits definitely give overwhelming evidence of a world wide flood as recorded in the Bible. Nothing else could've so suddenly trapped and preserved the structures found here. I would recommend to visit this place with an open mind to knowledge.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kseam6259
50,Where else can you touch something from 33000 years ago.,"This isn't a hyped up tourist attraction so if that is what you are looking for this is not the place for you. If you want to see anthropologists in action and learn about dinosaurs, see tar bubbling from the earth and tons of other cool things it is a must do. The cost was 12 for adults and 5 for children and it took about 2 hours before the 7 and 9 year old that where with us wanted to go. We all really enjoyed our visit and would probably stop again if ever in LA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hockeymom
50,FASCINATING INSIGHT,"This site offers a great chance to learn about tar pits, including the animals that were trapped in them - notably mammoths. It's a pleasant and educational experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cascaispickles
30,small but interesting,interesting place but every small but work a look just to see what they have found int he tar pits..the lab is interesting to view just wish i had more time to view the cinema in there,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/253kerric
30,Not Bad But Not Great Either,We enjoyed La Brea but I wouldn't say it was a highlight of our time in L.A. or anything.It is pretty unique to see literal pools of tar in the middle of a modern city centre. And the interpretative centre is not bad at all. It's worth a visit and you do learn a lot about the ancient history and geology of the site.Worth doing if you're in the city centre but in my opinion there are better things to do with your time. I feel I'm bring a bit harsh but you can only call it as you see it or find it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bozeman-Dublin
40,Good for kids...,"Took the kids to the tar pits on the way back from Beverly Hills. Quite interesting place with a well curated museum. Plenty of skeletons supported by info.Good parking (costs $12) and you still have to pay for entry (another $12 per adult), but not bad value.Kids loved it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/griffon_remy
40,"La brea tar pits LA,CA",pretty fun to watch and enjoy. kids got bored towards the end though. Lots of sights to see. I thought it was very and enjoyable. Great for family's!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/samjes119
50,Fun Place for kids and grown ups,"On our way to San Diego, we stopped by at the La Brea Tar Pits Museum. Its right in the middle of the city, and erected at the site of pre-historic tar pits from 10,000 - 50,000 years ago. The Sprawling campus has many ""active sites"" - Meaning site from which archeological remains are being dug out on a daily basis.The museum has very detailed information about the fauna/flora that existed during that time. They also have couple of informative 3D shows and one where a giant Sabre tooth cat Animatronics model roams around amidst the kids. It was a huge hit with my daughter.Highly recommended!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sreevals
50,Awesome museum,I visited La Brea tar pits and museum in November and had an amazing time. It was really well worth visiting. Amazing to see the tar still bubbling up gasses. Fantastic place for all ages. Highly recommend a visit. Great price for entry and the 3D movie is a must.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dsmbp
30,Didn't do the museaum,"For a quick drop in, it's worth seeing the tar pits. We would have benefited to see more in the museum to understand it all but we had limited time, so we dropped by and saw what we could. Pretty cool! I bet the museum would have upped this a bunch!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LetsMaketheMostofIt
50,Fascinating,"Highly recommended for a visit. Entry to the park is free, and it is a nice place to walk around. It's worth paying the entry fee for the museum, and the movie (extra cost) is worth seeing too. It is a great place to visit for the family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/simonkX9694QI
40,Visit with Wife,My Wife has always had a fascination with fossils...I decided to take her here during a business trip...She really enjoyed the tour...There are over 5 million fossils that have been excavated to date and the exhibits are interesting and interactive...We had a great time and learned quite a bit...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jackcS553KE
50,Who knew tar could be so cool,This remains one of my favourite places to visit. Reasonable admission price. I recommend paying the additional 5 - for the movie. Good for all ages. Make sure you walk around the park as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A1L2N3
40,Nice educational experience,Took my family and they enjoyed the terriifc living learning experience. The science behind the research was terrific as well.. Worth the trip.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Miusa
50,Good mix of exhibits,"There was a good range of exhibits giving good information about what went on in this area for 1000's of years. Entertaining program, but good organization allowing comfortable viewing by 6 of us with no complaints.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PhxSpeak
20,Docents were the most interesting part of the museum.,"Enjoyed the docent objects and explanations. It's a small museum, but interesting. Outdoor exhibits is maybe 1/3 of the experience. I had disabled guests visiting with our group who parked in a vehicle accommodating wheelchairs who parked on the street and met us in the museum. Guest mistake was believing street parking was ok until 5 (it was actually 4pm) They were at their vehicle early, about 4:20 only to find their vehicle equipped for wheelchairs was towed. Unfortunately their memory of LA will be overshadowed with the panic of finding what tow yard it wound up (by the time we got there we barely made it to when the tow yard closes at 7pm) HOW to get everyone there and the outrageous cost of getting their vehicle back. This effectively ended the rest of vacation plans for the Los Angeles area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/smilief2014
50,Enjoyable and well worth the time,"It is a good sight seeing the tar pit as you enter the park. Watching the tar pit bubble provides a good photo opportunity if you are lucky but if you want to take some video footage, it is definitely we well worth persisting. Enjoy taking the time to check out the museum inside, and don't forget to check out the rest of the park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chris_sharry
50,Realistic setting for concrete dinosaurs,A fun place to stop and ponder the theatrics of how we imagine and narrate ages past on the way to LACMA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rolfa832
50,Wow! Must see,We really are fascinated by fossils but are used to those found I stone. The tar pits actually preserve them as bone. Who knew there were 6 foot sloths that existed. Fun and interactive exhibits. The bubbling tar outside was fascinating. Fun area to learn about history. If you enjoy nature and fossils this is a must see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amber1127
50,We spent an hour in the park,"What a great place to spend some time and sew the tar pits, better called the asphalt pits. Lots of great information as well as the pits. We did not have the time to go into the museum but the outside was like a museum in itself. Well worth the visit. Interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gdel64
40,"Spectacular for kids, interesting for adults.",A relatively short visit place with a lot of tar pit casualties on display. Mammoths and Saber Tooth tigers well represented. Research digging gives a constant supply of bones.The tar pits themselves are still been excavated and still catching animals.An interesting couple of hours visit in a nice environment.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tonyisleham
40,Quick visit - walk though park only,"We made just a quick stop to see the tar pits (no cost to walk in the park!), there are several informational signs around telling about the tar pits so if you don't have a lot of time, you can do a quick visit for next to nothing (parking $). I'd love to go back and see the museum - perhaps next time.Great for all ages.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JCAJCrew
30,Tour guide,"Our tour guide for the outside pits was great, took all the questions. Worked with the kids and really listened to them. Without her we would have no idea what the pits were about and what it took to find the bones in there. Very interesting. Just need to find a better way to get to the Museum and not have to drive thru such a bad area. Took 1 1/2 hours to get thru that part of LA and same route going back. Too long and very depressed area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sissy581
40,A cool spot...!,"Really awesome to see such an amazing active excavation site. You won’t need to be here more than an hour, maybe two so it’s the perfect pit stop, with The Grove nearby etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nimeshj2017
50,LA meets the ice age,"Go back in time to the ice age at the La Brea (tar in Spanish) tar pits, where saber tooth tigers got trapped and preserved in the tar pits - it's actually oil. The tar pits are in a park like setting and there is also a garden here with plants from the ice age.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/howards50
50,"Saber tooth tigers and wooley mammoths, oh my!","Saber tooth tigers and wooley mammoths, oh my! This is a fascinating place to wander and the museums are interesting. Be wary of the oozing tar that is percolating throughout the park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cavydad
30,Dissappointing,"The area around the Brea tar pits had undergone a revamp in recent years, so the park is pretty nice. The tar pits are sprouting all over the park but the tar pits are full of rubbish. It just doesn't do them justice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/grubs
50,Living History,"We lived in California years back and we have never visited the La Brea Tar Pits until now. The price of admission is completely worth the amount of work that has gone into this museum. To make things more affordable, military members receive free admission. Therefore, my husband was completely free, something we were not expecting at all. Adult admission is only $12.00 and children prices are good up until age 17. Something almost unheard of in the US. Ok, enough about the cost.The museum is well put together and amazingly most of the exhibits are actual bones retrieved from the pits. Watching the scientist at work was also fascinating. Touring the grounds and seeing the different pits made us wonder why the entire grassy area wasn't bubbling with tar. This is a great way to spend a couple of hours. Highly recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Melia808
50,Great visit,Enjoyed visiting this great and awesome museum and grounds. You can actually smell tar in the air. The staff were very friendly and informative.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C530WSdavel
50,Outta this world,This is free to the public very exciting to walk through the park to see all the different tar pits and all the excavation of the animals they have recovered while you’re walking through the parking lot there are two structures where the tar pits have started to engulf the parking lot they had to block it off it’s amazing to see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tjsandra
30,Mostly just interesting,"In the effort to be fully honest, we did not go into the museum (it was closed), but the surrounding area was interesting. It is suddenly very easy to imagine these huge creatures being sucked into the tar. And be sure to watch the Bubbling Tar Pits on Wilshire. Then you really have an image of primordial soup!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sewkap
50,Don't miss!,"So glad our family stopped here after visiting LACMA. It is right next door and worth a stop. Fascinating look into history of our planet and how it all began. We were lucky too that it happened to be FREE that day--a Tuesday not sure if that is every Tuesday, but check it out. Actual tar pits are still active and bubbling. You can watch people outside doing some excavation work as well as volunteers inside the museum working to uncover the treasures. The outside areas are free to walk around all the time but it really is a nice museum inside with interesting tid bits to keep every age engaged.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sweetbb
50,Very Very Interesting,A very unusual and interesting experience. You can see real tar pits and incredible fossils. A site and museum like this cannot be found easy. So do not miss.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PierreBMalta
50,Great experience for kids and adults,"Amazing museum with full size skeletons of woolly mammoths, dire wolves, birds, sloth, american camel and more.videos, live action performers, experience the pull of the tar, see the methane bubbling up from the outdoor tar pits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LaVinca
40,La Brea Tar Pits,"Very interesting place to visit. I had no idea before coming here that there were active tar pits in the middle of LA. I love finding unexpected things like this when travelling.Allow at least two hours to look around here if you want to do the museum as well as each of the pits.I highly recommend you do if you like this sort of thing.About A$12 per adult to enter the museum but the tar pits are free to view if you have bought a ticket to LACMA which we did.If you are intending to do both museums and the tar pits it will be a full days outing.You will probably not get to see everything but I can assure that after all the walking you will be looking for a foot massage and you'll sleep well that night.There are toilet facilities and restaurants/cafes on site as well as souvenir shops.The tar pits are all fenced off so no need to worry about children disappearing into them though there are tiny little eruptions around the park that I'm sure will attract the interest of inquisitive minds.Overall, a great day and worthy of your time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Heatm27
50,"Amazing, such a different place to visit","Outdoors was free to visit, but the actual centre housing the fossils cost, but it was only minimal.This place is amazing. There are naturally occurring pits of tar, of all different sizes, coming up through the ground, and bubbling up through the lake.As it's tar, it has a very strong bitumen smell. It's truly amazing to see it all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barbaracQ2713OL
50,Wonderful Exhibits and Experience,"I have wanted to go here since I was a boy and it was worth it. The ongoing excavations, demonstrations, exhibits, and shows all made it a magnificent journey through the real Jurassic Park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BobR623
50,Interesting,"I'm glad we came here. It is right next to the Museum, so it's easy to do both. The pits outside are free to walk around, but the museum inside you need to pay for. Very interesting. Be careful not to step in any tar!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jend859
50,A trip back in time,This is an amazing site there are 91 pits in which fossils were found from several types of Aminals and insects which were from thousands of years ago,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mikemJ9687YB
50,"Excellent museum, hard to park","Lots of activities for kids, make sure you make the walk around the museum, you can see the archeologists actively working and see the places the tar is coming up out of the ground. Well worth the trip",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KelAZ88
40,Very educational.,"If you like science, this is an excellent choice. Good for children. Fascinating that it's in the middle of LA, go inside and see the exhibits. Hard to believe that all this history dates to prehistoric times.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maxinedds
50,Interesting place,A very interesting site and small bit dated museum with an interesting exhibit. A true must see. It is interesting to see how close the tar is to the surface in the park as one sees tar in the grass everywhere.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PeterOdgaard
50,"Stayed for 2 hours, but could have been there all day",This was the 1 thing I wanted to do in LA. It was great! There are actual sticking pits that bubble frequently. There are even places throughout the grounds that the asphalt is seeping up so you can investigate yourself. The museum is a manageable size that you can enjoy it in 30 mins or 2 hours. There is a fossil prep lab on display so you can watch as the fossils are cleaned up for display! The Excavation tour is worth the 30 mins. The museum gift shop has exciting and desirable items for a variety of price points. I recommend it to everyone visiting the area. Very family friendly!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Annalida500
40,Such an unusual place right in the middle of L.A.,"Really liked our visit here. Very informative, shocking to see on Wilshire Blvd. It's a must see from the other ""attractions"" in L.A.

50,Don't Miss this One!,"This is so much fun-Tar-actually asphalt- oozing up in downtown LA-Fascinating information , great science and old-fashioned exhibits make this a fun spot. Why the capital of movie magic hasn't enhanced this exhibit is beyond me, but its still worth a visit. Couldn't Spielberg or some of the Jurassic Park people help out a tiny bit?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CPinCT
40,Fun and Unique Place to Visit,"We came for the weekend and stopped here first. It was right next to the LACMA. Easy to navigate by yourself if you wanted. We toured multiple ""pits"" by ourselves. We also paid the $12 for the Museum visit. To be honest, while I even donated $5 to the education fund, I don't know if it was worth the money. I enjoyed walking around outside and the museum was interesting, and if I had children with me I think they would have really liked it, but just being with a friend, I think we could have skipped it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emilymO4135ZQ
40,Interesting if you have time,"How can such a unique archaeological site not be fascinating? It does leave something to be desired in the presentation, however. The museum has so much potential, but we did enjoy learning about the history and on-going research happening here. Great if you have children!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ElizabethGT
50,Amazing history,"Millions of fossils to see. Multiple exhibits throughout. Timeline since Ice Age was an eye opener. We parked there and then walked over to the Art Museum. it was easy to get to. Then drove to Rodeo drive for lunch, which was not too far. Overall, impressive to imagine that this entire area was once an oil well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lauravZ9266YE

50,So cool!,"Definitely worth going to!! The Museum was fascinating, the tar pits were so cool to see, and I could have easily spent WAY too much money in the gift shop! If you do the hop on hop off bus like we did then you also get a discount on the entrance fee!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SasPopps
50,Must See,"Small museum with multiple pits throughout the grounds. Amazes me what it must have been like to do the excavation 100 years ago. Super cool to see the bones that have come out of the pits. Also extremely educational regarding the creatures that walked that area. Did you know there were indigenous camels in LA 10,000 years ago? Go when they first open in the morning. We were able to see everything in 2 hrs. The school groups started filling in about 30 mins before we left.

30,"Worth going to see the tar pits, but museum needs an update","I do recommend going to see the La Brea Tar Pitts because it's just really cool and something totally unique. I'm giving it 3 stars because the museum itself could really use and update. I recommend skipping the shows, the 3D one was old, poor quality, and boring, I didn't learn anything I couldn't have read on one of the exhibit placards. The exhibits were shabby. Seeing all the fossils is really cool, and walking around the grounds to see the pitts themselves is really amazing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SaraK987

50,Outstanding Interpretation of this unique geologic feature,"As a retired geologist, this was high on my must see places in LA. The museum is outstanding and you can actually watch real paleontologists working on bones trapped by the tar. Watch the bubbles of methane burst into the air. And, this helps explain how California's petroleum industry started and added to the economy of that State.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Thesaguaro
50,Fairly Unique,"There are a number of museums around the world with complete skeletons and fossils, but this is the only one I know that has the fossil beds on site with the museum and in the middle of a major city. It is really worthwhile but if you plan to come check online for parking. The museum has nothing and the city parking nazis in the surrounding streets are red hot even though the signage on where you can park and where not is minimal. Museum once you are in has a small number of fully complete skeletons but includes a lot of information in the displays, plus at extra cost there are a couple of shows. We saw the 3D movie and it was excellent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JRNSydney_Australia
50,Free day out,"We came here and were lucky enough that it was a free day, so interesting and so glad we got to see it.I'd recommend people see it, how much people have found from in these pits it's mind boggling.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CoasterNerdett
30,free park visit,"We ended up not paying for the museum, just parking, but just wandered around the park. It was interesting to see the tar bubble, and think of the dinosaurs who had gotten caught in the sticky mess and perished. I was particularly intrigued by the one small pit where 27 mastodons were identified. I also liked the photo showing how there used to be stone bridges that looked over the tar pits before some visitors got too curious. Considering it was free, it was great, and was one of the most unique park visits ever, perfect for little ones to stretch their legs, but I would have like some more signs or explanation of what was going on at each pit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cecesimms
40,"Mammoths, Sabre Tooths and Dire Wolves","This is a fun few hours to spend with the family or even by yourself. It’s one of those places you can spend an hour or so in or 3-4 depending on your interest level. There are lots of exhibits to see inside and it is a lot of fun watching the workers sort through material looking for items, cleaning bones, building skeletons, digging at the pits, etc. I would recommend going on a guided tour of the grounds outside. It’s free to do with admission and explains a lot about the area that most people don’t know. It lasts about 30 minutes. Bring some water with you if you are doing the outside tour on a hot day as there is sparce shade. Also, the facility has a gift shop but no snack bar so bring snacks if you want. The gift shop does sell bottled water or you can always leave and come back in as they give you an all-day wristband. There is a pizza place, a burger joint and a Starbucks right across the street. I don’t think it is a place you would visit over and over but it is definitely worth a one-time visit. You’ll want to take lots of pictures as well. Oh, and I thought Dire Wolves were only in Game of Thrones but I guess not.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JandAinAZ
50,Great stop,Very interesting and informational. Can see entire thing in 1-2 hours. Definitely do the entire outdoor loop. Then do the museum. Staff were super - friendly and knew answers to all my questions!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kirks668
50,Truly worthwhile visit to La Brea!,"My wife and two young kids (age 6 and 3) visited La Brea as part of our week-long spring break vacation in the LA area. We thoroughly enjoyed La Brea. The museum exhibits were top notch, there's an informative movie as well, and we loved walking around the grounds to look up close at the tar pits and excavation work. It is a beautiful park area that's easy to get to, easy parking etc. We really enjoyed our visit and highly recommend this to others.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GoGreenGoWhite1
30,Educational but Not a Lot There. Get Combo Pass.,"This was part of the GOLAPass, so for the money it was worth the pass through since it cost nothing additional to go through here. The history was interesting, and the presentation was very nice. The facilities were pretty impressive, and the walk around the campus was interesting. That being said, there is not a lot here. It is something to do on a lazy day, especially if included in a combo pass of some sort. But as a stand alone $12.00 a person? I would skip it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/runaway2travel
30,Buy the combo pass with Natural History Museum on the website,I would recommend this for older kids because the smaller ones might get bored. I didnt mind though because we got tickets at a good price by buying the combo pass with the Natural History museum on the website. Make sure to catch the free tour,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vanessa51910
50,Educational,"I read about the tar pits as a child and always wanted to go. I was finally able to go, and it didn't disappoint. It's right in the middle of the city, so the sound of the traffic can be distracting while looking at the tar pit. It was exciting to watch the tar bubbling. The museum is nice too and very informative, even though it was kind of crowded. You can learn all about the Ice Age, and chill in the atrium. They also have a very nice gift shop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/morrigan716
40,Page Museum is well worth it,You can get a good look at the La Brea Tar Pits without having to pay to enter the museum. However on this visit we had a good look around and appreciated both the exhibits and also watching volunteers painstakingly examining trays of material looking for fossils. Museum is a real child's paradise.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BobandJosie
50,A great half-day visit,"La Brea Tar Pits are in a well maintained public park - free admission. See the life-size models of many of the prehistoric animals in the still-active tar pits. Free access to the continuing archeological digs.It's all level or sloping access so strollers, buggies and wheelchairs will have an easy time. There are plenty of places to sit around in the park, in the sun or in the shade.The museum is exceptionally well laid out with scores of displays, including life size reconstructions and holographic images. The technicians work in a large fully glazed laboratory in the museum - watch them carefully extricate a bone from the tarry 'goo' or clean up the tooth of a sabre-tooth tiger.There are two theatres with shows on the hour and half hour throughout the day. We saw the 3-D film (special spectacles provided at the door. Volnteer docents are stationed around the galleries to offer explanations and answer questions.Tickets are sold in booths near the main entrances to the park (credit & debit cards only) or at the reception desk in the museum lobby. It's a fantastic experience for kids and pretty good for the adults too! Don't miss it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D6144QZstevem
50,Sabel tigers and Mammoth elephants,On my bucketlist for Los Angeles. Check. Was not dissapointed. Somewhat pricy. Paid $12 for parking. $11 for museum. $5 for 3D movie. $5 for live Infotaintment. The big park was free thou.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/141larsp
30,Interesting but not much there,A blind friend and I walked around the outside of the tar pits and it was very interesting. There was some interesting exhibits and things to learn.Unfortunately I wasn't so crazy about the museum. It's small and not a lot of interactive or tactile displays. It was quite boring for him- how much can he just listen to? I did enjoy watching the person fixing broken dinosaur bones.We were hoping to buy some fun gifts to bring home but it was small and didn't really have many choices.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jen78703
40,Very interesting,Had no idea this was smack in the middle of town...right next to LACMA. Go see both of them. The Tar Pits explain how the animals were trapped and preserved for us to see. They are still finding new things.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jacquelinerose5
50,Great Childhood Memories Shared With My Kids,"Growing up in L.A. County meant school field trips to The La Brea Tar Pits. I was fascinated as a child and really enjoyed traveling back to Southern California to share the experience with my teenage sons. Definitely, an interesting place to visit and a must see with kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Soulmates2012
40,Great lake,"We finally found ourselves at the tar pits after talking about going for three years. We paid for our tickets and the staff was excellent. I wish we were given a map of the outside attractions. I found this frustrating as I wasn't sure where I was going. However, the placards were helpful in explaining what we were seeing. We loved the lake - what a wonder to see the earth living and breathing. The museum was excellent. We thoroughly enjoyed watching them behind the glass sifting through earth to find fossils. It's a good afternoon attraction but don't plan on being there all day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melissac333
30,Interesting. Museum is over priced.,"It’s kind of unfortunate trip advisor puts The Tar Pits and The Page Museum in the same listing. It is absolutely free to visit but it’s in the surrounding park. While the tar pits are certainly not super exciting… They are kind of cool specially when you realize what they have. See the prehistoric gases lives in bubble even to this day and that’s pretty cool. What a lot of people don’t know is that there actually multiple times.. Other than the big one, be sure to visit pit 91. The Tar Pits alone get 4 stars. A nice place to picnic. Even better, visit LACMA just next door.The museum is much smaller than it looks. You can easily do the entire museum in 20 minutes. So it is vastly overpriced. You can get in free by reserving tickets with your LA COUNTY library card. But parking is still $12. Next time I’m going to forward street parking… But I thought we would be more than a few hours before I knew how little was in the museum. Don’t get me wrong... they have some cool stuff. The atrium is nice... it’s just a quick visit. Taking value into consideration I’d give this a 2.5... so mixed with the 4 star tarpits I’ll give it a 3.If you live in Los Angeles usual absolutely visit the tar pits. But skip the museum. If you are visiting and have heard how cool the Tar Pits are, but I have a limited time… You can skip it altogether. If I was only here for a week there are much more fun things to see in LA than the tar pits. But if you’re here a while, check them out!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bostonsavatage
50,Transported back to the Ice Age!,A great day at the museum located right in the heart of urban Los Angeles. We paid €12 to enter the museum and opted to watch a 3D 25 minutes film on the creation of the museum and the history of the Tar Pits for an extra €5. The film was very informative giving a history of global climate change and a dramatisation of the Ice age era and the creatures living then.The museum is nicely laid out with well preserved skeletons of the animals which met their end in the Tar Pits. There also is a working lab where the discoveries are still being recorded today.The park outside which is free to enter shows the Tar Pits and current archeological digs.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Interailtraveller
50,Very interesting,"In the middle of the busy metropolis of Los Angeles a real gem. The tar pits are interesting and the smell of tar in the air is hard to miss. The parking is expensive so you better park outside with meters... we did not visit the museum, in which the fossils are kept only the park. There are excavations in progress, digging into the tar.... the story of the place is truly amazing. An oil field under the park sends pits of tar and asphalt to the surface. Thousands of years ago al sorts of wild life and animals including mammoth stepped over pits and just sank in, like in a swamp, to their death. Their fossils are being dug out by the thousands on daily basis. Go and visit with your young.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/menachemi
50,The history of some pretty amazing science.....,"Often, when people think of Los Angeles, they think of celebrities and the diversity of the culture, or amusement parks. Which are all great. But, when I took my children here, to take a moment, and go back in time, and think about what happened, right here where I was standing...... it is pretty mind-blowing. To see the displays with the Dire wolves, and realizing while looking down in the pits, that fossils were right there. The story of the circus elephants that escaped and got stuck in pits in 1935, was then rescued by other circus elephants. The displays were interesting and educational. The guided tour was fun and informative.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Embraceyourjourney
50,very unexpected and wonderful,"I had no expectations before going here. I recommend watching both of the videos. However, the mechanical sabertooth tiger might be a little scary for younger children. Amazing exhibits of prehistoric skeletons that were displayed well. Lots of people just come to the lovely park area for lunch. Right next door to the Page Museum as a bonus. Some excellent souvenirs, I love the rocks!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pollyreid
50,Science in action!,"I loved visiting the La Brea tar pits and museum. There is a museum with fossils, ancient skeletons and other artefacts excavated from the asphalt pits. I particularly enjoyed seeing the live fossil dig that has been going on since 1915.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/362jennj
10,Another special plac!e especially great for family visits - very educational and unique,Children love visiting this place and adults can be equally entertained and facinated with the findings there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/666verab
50,What an intriguing place to visit,"If you are in the Los Angeles area for vacation, this is a must see place. Bring your Family and spend at least 4 hours. There are great places to eat nearby and it is a great place for the family",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/everythingceltic
50,Educational and fun for adults and kids...,"This past weekend my family was in LA for a wedding. While my wife was busy participating in the pre-wedding activities I needed to find something fun and entertaining to do with my son so we didn't end up in the hotel playing video games all day.What we decided on was to visit the La Brea Tar Pits and Museum. It was fantastic! One of those bucket list items for me for sure. We both had a great time walking around the famous bubbling pit at the entrance to the museum. Once inside the museum we opted for the tickets that included both the puppet show and the Ice Age 3D movie.The puppet show was very good and quite honestly a bit frightening. The saber toothed cat was very intimidating and my son was glad to have been seated in the back row further away from the action.The 3D movie was okay, yet a bit dated by comparison to other 3D and 4D movie experiences that we have enjoyed in the past.Perhaps the highlight of the visit was the hands-on experiment where visitors can see what it would be like to be stuck in the tar. Visitors can pull up on these metal rods that are submerged within a gooey tar substance. Pulling up on these rods is very challenging and gives you a sense for what it must have been like to be an unfortunate animal who stumbled into the tar pits.We would definitely recommend this museum and experience to anyone who has a few hours to spend visiting in the LA/Beverly Hills area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rubicon_Johnny
50,Visit the past,"A truly unusual place to visit and learn about the past. Buried in the tar pits are thousands of skeletons of animals, insects and plants that lived thousands of years ago. They have painstakingly put skeletons together so you can see the full size of these lost species.You can watch scientists at work and learn about Los Angeles so long ago.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anneparham
50,A Truly Unique Experience,"To visit the LaBrea Tar Pits and Museum is to go back in time 40,000 years while remaining in 21st century LA. The bubbling pits of asphalt are a trove of fossils of mammoth, dire wolves, giant sloth and many more prehistoric animals. Complete skeletons of these animals abound and you can see the fossils being cleaned by hand in the fishbowl work area or being extracted from the tar pits now under excavation in the working pits. There is a good film and helpful docents to answer questions. Definitely the most unique Museum I've been to in the World. Nowhere else are they extracting whole skeletons of extinct species. A must for families and amateur archeologists of all ages!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MissMeda
50,Not just for kids,"We walked around and looked at the Tar Pits first then got intrigued and decided to buy the tickets to walk the museum. Just beware that some weekday mornings, they host classes of kids. We were lucky in that the large group of kids were leaving right when we started the museum tour around 11am. It was interesting and didn't take long. Very informative and always a nice reminder of how long life has been existing on Earth.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LuvY0ga
50,Amazing!!,This wonder in the middle of the city is worth taking the family. It leaves time to do other things in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MSReviewer007
50,Pretty impressive!,"This is probably one of the best museums I have been to! I would recommend you to take one of the guided tours. They have giant Mammoths, saber tooths, and dire wolves (GOT fans!). Do yourself a favor and go visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/addiction4travel
30,An Interesting Place to Visit,"Easy to find, follow your nose!The tar pits are well presented and not as big as I expected it is still worth a visit. You can enter the grounds for free but to explore the Museum there is a charge.It was my wife & I first visit to LA so we had booked a private day tour customised to our requests so Tar Puts on the list.The display of animals trapped in the tar pits is very well done and the walkway around the pits is well sign posted with information signs.Yes go here and enjoy, only need to allocate between 30mins to 90mins would be plenty of time and it is easy to walk about",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NewieTraveller
50,Wow!!! Pleasantly surprised!,I wasn't really sure about going but my husband wanted to check it out. Be prepared to pay $12 for parking. We walked around the museum and grounds and was so interested and had multiple questions so we decided to stay for the guided tour. It was mind boggling to think of this part of LA being on an oil field and from earthquakes and shifts in the rock layers that the asphalt seeps to the ground. It was amazing to see all the fossils actually discovered on the property and at the art museum next door!!(There is a cafeteria at the art museum at which you can eat but expect museum prices.) Definitely would be a great place for a picnic!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/famw2girls
30,was ok,we visited the tar and it did not take long to get round/ Maybe we expected more. he only time we had seen the tar pits was on Volcano The Movie LOL,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ukguyz
50,Outstanding experience,"Excellent museum with many nice exhibits. It is set up quite well and very educational. The active tar pits and active excavations are so interesting. Absolutely worth the time and cost to attend. Of course, parking is not free, but it is still worth visiting the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/g3times
50,An educational and historical place to see,"Over three million fossils have been found here, mainly dinosaurs, who were trapped in the tar, thousands of years ago.. There are also life sized replicas of these extinct mammals which are located in the still bubbling tar pits. There are no guided tours, and no entrance fees..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/484karlc
50,"Great experience, interesting find","Great museum, the kids thoroughly enjoyed their visit and were awe struck by the many artefacts and different types of prehistoric animals and plants being found right where they were standing. They could not get over some of the bones found in tat and asked so many questions about how Tar was made, where else is it found and they couldn't wait to find out more. They really enjoyed getting up close and seeing what else was being found in the pits.Plenty of parking, affordable and informative. The grounds are wonderful and an easy walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MedusasRiot
50,A must see,"Super interesting museum, spectacular, offers an easy and understandable way of learning about the tar pits. You`ll need a few hours to go around but it's absolutely worth it. Well explained and well organized.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JuditE85
30,Checked off my bucket list,The experience is something I am extremely glad I had and get to check it off my bucket list. It didn't take long to go through everything and the cost of parking was a bit high.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alexisr39
40,Prehistoric Los Angeles,"Yes, there were creatures living in the Los Angeles area ten thousand years ago - not dinosaurs, but other amazing ones, such as giant mammoths and saber-toothed tigers. Great for the little ones.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traveledfordecades
50,Only gets better with time,As a native born LA person - I have been visiting this place for years and years. They just keep making it better. Lots to see and do and you can sit on the lawn for free!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jacksbat3
50,Fascinating activity - great for all ages!,We spent a morning at the Tar Pits before doing an afternoon tour of LA. The La Brea Tar Pits & Museum were fantastic. Well worth the price of admission.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmandaH662014
50,So fun and informative!,"This is just really well done. My husband and I spent a little bit of time walking the grounds before the museum opened and then went into the museum. It is just fascinating to be able to see volunteers looking through the fossils. There were volunteers/docents also available to answer questions. We had a good time, and it's great that this shares a campus with the Los Angeles County Museum of Art!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/URspider03
50,Finally made it!,I've wanted to come here ever since I was a kid and while studying Geology at uni and today I finally got my chance and I wasn't disappointed.Firstly you can wander around outside for free looking at the bubbling tar (or should I say asphalt) pits and spot where fresh seepages are popping up. Then you can pay to enter the museum and find out more including watching scientists cleaning the fossils and preparing them for cataloging.There are also a number of additional shows you can pay to watch. We did he 3D show Titans of Ice which was very good.Anyway if you are in LA and want to see something really cool that isn't shallow celebrity nonsense come here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christophercL3377CG
40,History and science all here,"Really enjoyed this museum. It is set up nicely and you learn a lot about Paleontology and Earth Science. We spent three and one half hours and at a leisurely pace saw most, but not all of the events and exhibits. I definitely recommend paying to see both the 3D movie and the interactive story, as they bring the ideas of life and help younger children engage. It was fun to see the volunteers at work sorting fossils in the lab, even on a Sunday afternoon. Ended up parking on the street a few blocks away, but didn't really have trouble finding a place to park on a Sunday. Other days of the week it may be harder to park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cabtah
40,Cool to see,"We just stopped by to see the pits outside. Stinky, but cool to see. Our teen girls weren't interested in going inside, but thought they were neat to see. Lots of room on the grounds for a picnic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wendybayer
50,Oil and Tar,"Fascinating visit to see actual archeologists still looking for fossils. Oil still bubbles to the surface with a sulphuric smell. We went into the museum, reasonably priced. Dinosaur bones and life size animals fill the museum. A few animal models even move.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ROMENTraveler2014
40,Amazing site in heart of L.A.,"I visited here with my family (wife and two kids, age 10 and 12) on a Sunday afternoon in July 2017.We parked in the museum parking lot ($) and tried to figure out exactly where to go. There was an outdoor ticket booth with a long line and two buildings in the area. Of course, we started walking to the wrong one.I found a staff member who directed me to the museum itself where we could check in. Luckily, there was a short line for those who had purchased their tickets online. I was also able to purchase admission to a 3-D movie.We toured the indoor museum (fascinating), looked inside the lab where staff were working, and took lots of pictures! There was lots to see and do and touch which really kept the kids entertained. We watched the fascinating 3-D movie and made our way outside to tour the exterior sites – including the huge tar pit with the mastodon models. You can see the bubbles still coming up through the tar.We were able to join in on a tour in progress and I am so glad we did as the tour guide was really knowledgeable and was able to answer lots of questions.This was a fascinating museum in a unique location – in the heart of a major city (and close to the Grove and Farmer’s Market, too).A great experience and highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dms666
50,You must go here if you are in LA,"Fun for all ages, interesting for everyone. Lots to see so plan a half day for this activity and if you also want to see the art museum it is right next door.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chh19
40,Took a friend from out of town,"The place was extreemely busy with ""alot"" of school excursions along with the kids ""NOT"" on their best behaviour. Next time I would go when the little darlings are in exams or on holidays. Apart from that the museum was very interesting & informative",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Morfynn
50,A unique museum in California,"Outside the entrance the bubbling lake of pitch with its mastodon family statues enthralls children and adults alike. This beautiful and accessible museum has a huge educational component with its vast collection of Ice Age bones and assembled skeletons of dire wolves, giant sloths, mastodons and saber tooth tigers. Visitors can look through picture windows to see volunteers sorting through materials that have been collected at the digs outside just beyond the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/901nelsc
50,Worth every minute!,Finally saw the tar pits and meandered thru the museum- worried my14 year old girls would roll their eyes... they loved it too. Happy that we made the stop.-,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CElsesser
40,Allow more time,"Our first time here and thought we could 'do it' in a hour or so, were we wrong!Found it very fascinating even with school groups & other vistors filling the building.Suggest you do allow at least a couple of hours to wander around and do the walking tour as it (the tour) takes you to other areas (outside) which do wouldn't otherwise hear about.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/79NickS
40,Working excavation site,This is a nice day trip. The museum docents are very informed. The excavation tour is very interesting. A gem in the middle of Los Angeles. It would be nice if there was a cafe on site but there are plenty of places to eat in the area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GretaGarboFranklyn
30,Overpriced,"We enjoyed it but from the parking to the museum, I just felt like it was overpriced. Years ago we were here and everything was free. I realize that times change and you need a cash flow to keep things current and updated, but they've gone too far.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lindak583
40,Today is your lucky day...,"That's what the guy said at the parking, and another at the ticket sale. The computer system was broken when we arrived and had free parking ($12), free admission and a free 3D screening about the tar pits. Museum is worth visiting. Very nice staff is eager to tell stories and explain about the tar pits. Nice is that one can experience the forces of the tar once trapped.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peterjanse
40,Park with real tar pits,"A quiet and beautiful park, with some tar spots emerging from the ground. There are archaeological research currently being done, as animals and plants got stucked into the tar pits over time, and you can see its results in the museum. There are information signs about it scattered throughout the park as well. There is a bubbling lake with mammoth replicas",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/334lg
50,Incredible that is in the middle of Los Angeles,"This is probably the greatest depository of animal and plant fossils/ skeletons numbering over 750,000 species. The museum was one of the first in the country built to have the visitors interact with the exhibits. The is a pit viewing area where you can see current excavations in progress.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/man4pnw
30,Very Interesting,Visited with my daughter who is a science teacher and loves paleontology. She was very intrigued with the Tar Pits. I found them very interesting and learned a lot on my visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/muggsy082017
50,The original Ice Age,"It´s a return to the Ice Age at the heart of Los Angeles.It´s amazing see the Mamonths, Saber tooth Tiger, Dire wolves, and many other creatures found at the Tar Pits, worths a visit, for children is really interesting and educative",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cida
40,interesting,were in the vicinity and dropped inpleasant staffgood range of attractions with the working pit interesting to viewunusual natural thing in la,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnnycash3630
40,Fun For History Buffs,Our family recently visited here and had a great time. Yes the tar pits do give off a smell but it really isn't as bad as some people make it out to be. The museum is nice as well but not all that big so you won't need to much time to walk the whole thing. The exhibits are very interesting though and a few people in our family really like history and archeology so this was perfect for them. They also have a cute little garden to walk around in the museum itself.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarsiM_13
40,Right downtown LA.,"This is very interesting place to just walk around and read the placards of the history. Parking is sparse but convenient. The pits are free to wander around just watch where you place your feet, some tar is not well marked.It's free to walk thru, you only have to pay to go thru the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R55Wilson
30,It was ok,The museum itself was nice. Watching people work on fossils was interesting and the volunteers were pleasant. We opted to take the tour that went to the working excavation but ended up doing out quickly. The young lady who led it was pleasant but you could tell her whole tour was geared to small children. It was unpleasant for adults.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deniseb979
30,Educational museum for prehistoric fact enthusiasts,"This small indoor museum offers a wealth of information about prehistoric creatures and a close up view of real bones of extinct species and creatures. $12 parking, $12 adult entrance fee. Lower fees for children and seniors. We came especially to see the featured 3-D Ice Age movie experience (additional costs apply) and were disappointed that the attraction was closed due to technical problems. The museum is surrounded by a beautiful park that smells strongly (and appropriately) of tar. There is also a lovely Japanese garden to walk through. Overall, I wouldn't have spent the amount of money that I did considering the limited experience that we had however our short visit was interesting and educational.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ahavaemunahl
30,Smell is very strong.,"Its a little surprising to find a TarPit in the middle of the city but my son was very interested in. So helped to find out some answers about his questions. If you have a sensitive nose , don't go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ArzuUzel
50,Great for science,The grounds and museum are excellent. People are cleaning the fossils inside by hand. You can walk outside for free and experience some of this. Save money by parking on the street nearby for free instead of paying $12 extra.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kenj531
50,So GREAT!! Part of my favorite day in LA!,"This was truly a unique experience. Where else have you seen a tar pit? It is amazing to imagine what LA must have looked like 4-5 thousand years ago and to think about all the animals that became trapped in the tar - allowing them to be preserved. We spent a half day here. The grounds are lovely. Younger kids will like running around the park. We took the guided tour of the outdoor tar pits, which was somewhat informative. The indoor museum was small, but unique. It was amazing to see the number of fossils that have been un-earthed.There is no food at LaBrea Tar Pits museum, but a few food trucks outside. We walked over to the LA County Museum of Art, which is right next door. We had lunch in the LACMA café and spent the remainder of the day in the Art museum. It was my favorite day in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/556helenk
50,If you have a thing for science and history this is a must,You can spend 20 minutes here or six hours here. We didn't go instead the museum but walked through the park and saw the pits. Very very cool. There are posters up everywhere explaining everything. Plenty of street parking nearby.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DougD1390
20,Expensive - Just Roam Outside,The museum is quite expensive and did not offer as much as I had anticipated. It's better to simply roam the grounds.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/990crashp
50,A Jewel in the middle of LA!,"It's really cool to see an active tar pit and excavation site in the heart of Los Angeles. This was my favorite jogging grounds when I first moved here. Known as the Miracle Mile, this place has seen high rises all around it. It still remains as a great preserved attraction. How about free admission? Yep! Watch the pit as the depictions of animals that used to get swallowed in the black tar (the reason it is one of the most fruitful excavation sites in North America) What to do next? Next door. LACMA. Again one of the best art museums in North America. Love!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/89dustinf
50,Fossils in LA? Unbelievable!,"The La Brea Tar Pits and the Page Museum is a must do activity for everyone. Who would have believed that these tar pits in the middle of Los Angeles would yield such a trove of prehistoric fossils. The story behind how these animals lived and died in the locale was intriguing. Even my 4-year old grandson was enthralled, especially when he could touch the skull of a Saber-toothed Cat!The docents were wonderful and did a great job of explaining the exhibits and the history of the animals.We thoroughly enjoyed the 2.5 hours that we spent there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/731larryt
40,Travel into the past right in the city,Fascinating place - tour guide was knowledgeable and entertaining. Be prepared for the smell - it is tar after all. See some active dig sites as well as watch people in the lab prepare artifacts,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sabrasworld
50,A unique and happening place!,"A very impressive and enjoyable paleontological museum, with active excavations in progress much of the year, and an analysis lab on the premises. NOT dinosaurs but ice-age fossils like sabertooth tiger, dire wolf, ground sloth, and long-extinct new world horses and camels. The tar pits are still bubbling, this is a unique and happening place! While kids would find this very enjoyable and interesting, all the adults in my family really enjoyed it. Right next to LA County Museum of Art, which is also super!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Roy-Tto
40,Curious and enthralling,"I found this place quite enthralling. They have a range of exhibits which were extracted from the tar pits over the last century - mammoths, sabre tooth tigers being the most memorable. The video is informative as it give a view of how they have work the site. Definitely worth spending some time here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gerryk615
50,Great affordable day out!,We came to the tar pits as we had heard about them from other friends who visited from Australia and have to say... we had a brilliant time!So much can be seen without having to pay an admission fee (unheard of in Australia) and the cheap admission into the museum was worth the price!Informative friendly guides and lots of intetesting information.Day well spent!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alinom6
40,Neat Area in the Middle of the City,"Not a must see to me, but an interesting perspective on the history of the tar pits in LA. Many pre-historic animals were trapped in the tar pits leaving thousands of bones behind.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sgathright1
30,Quick Trip to the Tar Pits,"My husband always wanted to come here, and we finally did. Parking is $12 and tickets to the museum is $12 per adult. It was little hot on the outside, so we didn't spend much time. Nice museum though, great fossil display with lots of information, you can experience how hard it is to get out of the tar pits without getting tar on your clothes! They also offer free excavation tours but we did not go since it was little too warm for my husband to stay in the sun... bring a floppy hat, sunscreen, and water bottle if you plan on visiting during the summer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/naokog215
40,"Excellent volunteers, most expensive penny press","I'm a 2nd grade teacher and we have a 7yo and 21mo, we live in Va Beach. We have never been this far west before but are road tripping so when we had the time and opportunity, we stopped!We only had an hour before the museum would close but we got through it all, even took our time.The volunteers were amazing! Only two people are paid to work here, the rest younsee everywhere want to be there and do it happily! We asked one guy lots of questions and he was very knowledgeable and friendly. Another young lady with the microfossils was just as helfpul and kind and let all the kids ""help"" her sort the tiny fossils as she answered their questions.I had no idea they are still working this site! The lab is so cool, and the older volunteers inside often stopped to smile and wave at us, which is all the 21mo wanted. :)They did have a penny press, but after traveling state through state collecting pressed pennies, we were shocked this one was the only one that charged $1 instead of 50c. Crazy!We loved walking the grounds and could have watched the methane bubbles gurgle in the tar pits a lot longer. Yeah there's a tar smell but that's where you are!There are lots of neat little photo ops all over, but keep in mind the actual excavation pit across the lot also closes at 5, so we didn't get to go in there.We are all so glad we made time for this, very interesting!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Adje1124
40,La Brea Tarpits,I had never heard to this place so it was very interesting to hear about how it all happened. I would probably never have visited however it was on our bus trip and it was a surprise to find this in a populated area. Worth a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kelvinandamanda
50,Great education,"This was my first visit to the Tar Pits. The first exhibit was of the tar pit with the mastodon pelvis, wolf skull, camel jaw, and bison upper arm bone. I also liked watching the technicians at the work stations applying n-propyl bromide to remove asphalt from 42,000+ year-old specimens. The skeletons mounted around the museum were impressive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jonpan2014
50,Loved our visit!,"If your children love science or the ice age, this is a neat place that is inexpensive. The staff are very knowledgeable and friendly. Our kids found this very enjoyable and they learned a lot too! I must also brag on the staff, as our son experienced an unexpected flare of arthritis in his ankle and was having trouble walking. They loaned us a wheelchair at no charge so that he could enjoy his visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/966kimberlyn
50,Visit to La Brea Tar Pits,"This was a very interesting experience, we were ages 3-62 and all of us enjoyed it. Most of the viewing is outside seeing the tar pits in various locations. The museum is infoors and was also very interesting for all ages.Staff was very knowledgeable and helpful.Well worth the visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PapaChuck41914
40,"Kids into Dinos, then a must stop","If you or your kids are into dinosaurs then this place should not take much convincing of its worth in time or a little green. There is a dedicated parking lot for a fee connected to the Museum. It is not a large Museum but its interesting. There are different shows for additional fee above the basic entrance fee. But it a la cart so do what you choose and save where you want. You can smell the tar from the pits while outside, so those with breathing issues - be aware.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MIke23693
50,Pre-historic right in the middle of the city,"We were on the Star Line City Sightseeing LA Bus on the Red Route and specifically wanted to visit the Tar Pits. These can be found at Stop 10 of the Red Route which is at Wilshire / South Fairfax Avenue.We entered via West 6th Street and enjoyed a good relaxing few hours, strolling around the park which is free on entry and visiting all the various pits. It was a real education to read all the history and facts, which is amazing to witness a pre-historic site within the confines of this busy, bustling and modern city.This is a must see attraction, plenty to do and enjoy, which can be totally free to you if you don't wish to purchase any refreshments or visit the museum.Highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MartinG476
40,Interesting,"Very interesting museum, great for kids as well as adults.The free tour was worth going on to find out more about the pits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MallorcaLover
50,Family wedding trip,Did not go into the museum. Took the free walk around the pits. Very informative signs and the view of the actual pits is awesome. On weekdays you can watch fossils being cleaned and cataloged.Spend about and hour and enjoyed it very much.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/727deborahs
40,Ok to skip museum,All the tar pits and excavation si'll side but included a working lab where they were cleaning and sorting fossils. Not sure it was the $$. Friendlist staff we've encountered so far!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sandramU8664ES
50,Nice museum,We enjoyed learning as a family. Good museum and 3d movie. Located next door to other museums so got to see a lot more than we planned,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaryHude
40,Fun learning,"This is a great place for anyone interested in Natural History. Extremely well laid out, interactive areas, indoors and out. Good 'shows/3D experiences. Learning with enjoyment.One word of warning, nearest Metro stop may be Le Brea but there is then a 2O minute bus ride!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Driftboat
50,An LA classic,"Everyone should do an LA Weekend. Stay in LA and visit the walk of fame, Griffith Observatory, Staples Center and the La Brea Tar Pits. The history and still living history will turn everyone into a dinosaur junkie.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kevingN7214FF
30,Don't Drive Out of Your Way,"I don't mean to be cruel, but don't drive out of your way for this -- unless you have kids to entertain. I found the facility mostly disappointing. Add in the Parking Fees, lack of a Restaurant or Cafe, empty Pits that really aren't pits, and mostly uninformative presentations -- and, well, you'll have more fun elsewhere.Don't get me wrong. The people are great! The exhibits can be interesting for a few minutes. They are what they are. The prices are not exorbitant. But the ""play"" in one theatre is simply too short. The live-action ""saber tooth"" is entertaining - for 8-year-olds, but I really expected more creatures. This costs $5 and was over in a very short time. You do learn a few tidbits -- such as ""tar"" is man-made, and the pits are not truly ""pits"", and maybe the entire area has the wrong name because of this.The 3D Film was disappointing as the ""special effects"" of 3D just aren't very 3D-ish.If you are imagining dinosaurs buried in tar here -- they don't exist. Nothing like that to see. All of the pits are empty, save for a smattering of liquid asphalt a few inches deep. The creatures unearthed here as fossils lived right alongside mankind before they were wiped out by the Ice Age. So there is some historical significance to the place.The grounds are pretty enough. Your group may have more fun holding a picnic, or playing Frisbee in the open areas. After seeing 150 skulls of Dire Wolves, it gets kind of boring.So where did I actually enjoy myself? At the adjacent LACMA art gallery complex -- because they had about 150 rare (and authentic) Japanese netsuke on display. Yet another $10 to see that -- but I was in 7th Heaven!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/UncleGuy
30,"Historic, important, but avoid the food truck","Visited on a hot Sunday in August 2017. Group with one small child, 3 adults, 2 senior citizens.The site is historic, astounding, and an important learning experience for all. The talented teaching staff and docents inside the museum have skills that are a solid match to the researchers and scientists working in the excavation pits outside. The museum is small, but well balanced with the many pits and excavation sites outside where covered areas welcome guests to watch the work in progress.Plan of visit: There are two areas to see, the museum which is well organized and air conditioned with movies and a prehistoric animal dramatization show option, and then outside is a large walking loop that allows you to see excavation in progress and a prehistoric plant garden. Both deserve your attention, but pace yourself to balance your time between the two, and take weather (especially heat) into account as you do.The food truck: Outside the museum on the front lawn is a food truck whose name ""The District by Hannah An"" and it also includes the logo for La Brea Tar Pits on the side, indicating this is a collaboration between the Tar Pits and a local eatery, not a random food truck. Please save your time, money, and calories. The service was ridiculously slow, slow, slow, and when we finally got the food it was bland and tasteless.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Buckeyetoyou
50,Educational Experience,The La Brea tar pits are well worth the stop. Very educational and not far from Hollywood Blvd. Take Uber as parking is limited.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melanielg11
30,"Enjoyed, but disappointed","I have always wanted to see the tar pits. It was fairly dried up in most the pits and not very bubbly, so I was a bit disappointed. I'm not sorry we went though. There was lots of great information to be gleamed and was a unique attraction.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LelahK
30,Neat to see but don't go out of your way to visit,The museum was overprices for the size but the few exhibits they had were cool to see. It was also cool to see the bubbling tar pits in the park. We enjoyed it but I would only recommend seeing if you are already in the area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/heatherhJ3541NI
40,A Must See! It is a live excavation site!,"I guess with the word 'tar' in it, I never cared to see this. A friend came in town and requested this visit so off we went! I gave 4 stars, knocking off one star for the parking and the unfortunate standing in the hot sun to buy tickets for 15-20 minutes. Clearly there were many parking spots available in the attraction parking lot, and an employee was standing outside the parking lot, stopping us from going in. She was stating we had to find parking elsewhere. We asked why we couldn't park there pointing out all the open spots and she said that they only allow a certain number of cars in at a time. She said when other cars leave she would let other cars in. Two cars were coming out and we pointed this out, but she said no. SO THAT WAS UNCOOL. Wondering if they get a kick back from the parking garage down the road. Then after parking and then schlepping down the street, we had to stand outside the building for some time in the sun to get inside. Wish they would either let the line form inside the building or put up an awning. BUT inside redeemed the visit. This amazing attraction is live and active. The bones you are looking at have been preserved by the asphalt. It was truly amazing. I did not know it was an active excavation site. You can see the air caught beneath the water bubble up as asphalt bubbles up with it in the lake. We went to see the 3D ice age movie and it was well worth it. The excavation tour and fossil lab were pretty awesome as well. Totally recommend. Amazing exhibits. Great time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/socaligirl222
50,Amazing,"Wow this was such a fantastic, interesting and incredible place to visit . We were very impressed by everything we saw here . The tar Pitts , museum , the show explained a lot about the history . We learned so much more from this museum than We expected. Gift shop there also . We have told everyone we see to visit this place when they visit Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SJDW2011
40,Amazing in the heart of the city,Been in Los Angeles a few times and never knew this existed. Watched the gas bubble up through the oil. Also a lovely park.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jimbo190947
40,Our first LA stop!,"Growing up my husband and I had heard a lot about this place but through our adult years not so much. My teenagers had never heard of it. It was easy to find and there was space in the parking lot. Although a steady stream of people seem to come through there I would not say it was packed. We took some others advice and decided to skip the museum and just walk around the grounds. There are several pits you can walk up to that are fenced but there are plaques attached to the fences with facts and information. We lucked out in that while we were there a tour was going on that started inside the museum but made its way outside and around the grounds. We were able to walk up and follow along with the tour as did many others. There were areas there to have a picnic or sit and relax, also a small kids playground area. We spent a couple hours at the most there. Very interesting to see the bubbling pits!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/277kimw
50,Gotta Go At Least Once!,"The La Brea Tar Pits is a definite must do at least once in your lifetime. The history behind it is fascinating and it's just a unique place to visit. My wife really wanted to go there after seeing it in the movie Volcano, and we finally got a chance to see it this past July 2017. We ended up getting there around lunchtime, which is definitely not a good time to go. I would recommend getting there early and I would also recommend NOT going there on a Tuesday. The parking is very limited and on Tuesday's, there is no street parking from 12-3pm for street cleaning. We were lucky to have been able to loop back around and was able to get parking eventually there, but I spent a good 30- 45 minutes just trying to park there in total. But after you park and you're all settled, it's definitely a place that we loved! We ended up seeing the movie Titans in the Ice Age, and felt that was good movie showing the history of it all. I loved being able to see all the pits that were being worked on and even tar that was coming up from the ground in sections that weren't closed off yet. :) I would think we spent a good 2-3 hours there walking around and enjoying the place. We take a lot of pictures so you could probably do it under 2 hours. We loved it overall and would do it again, but I for sure wouldn't go on a Tuesday unless you like not being able to park right away. :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cyclones92
50,La brea tar pits!,The museum was super cool! My boys really enjoyed this! I would suggest having a picnic lunch around the museum which is right next to lacma (LA county museum of art). The grounds are gorgeous! We parked in the lacma garage. There was an entrance fee for the tar pits.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P1477OImichellew
50,So much history,Loved stepping out of the busy streets to enjoy this museum! A lot of fascinating information and fun facts!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AHouska
50,Amazing part of our history,Wow! there are still active tar pits erupting every day on these grounds. To learn the history of evolution of the great creatures that roamed this earth and their demise in the tar pits. And here's a cool part... you can still find new tar bubbles through the ground that continue to erupt! There are cones throughout the property alerting walking pedestrians of the gooey black mini eruptions. There is a museum attached for a small price to learn the history of the area and the items archaeologists have uncovered.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rosabomadi
40,Very Interesting,"The La Brea Tar Pits and Museum is reasonably priced. We did not pay for either movie. The excavator tour and the fossil lab tour were both very good. We learned a great deal, I would recommend a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sfp325
50,FASCINATING GLIMPSE INTO ICE AGE DISCOVERIES,"Not sure why it took us so long to finally visit both the park and the museum. What an excellent and eerie experience. To see the gas bubbles in the lake popping up, the cones all over the grounds where new tar escapes have been found or wandering through the exhibits and movies inside the museum makes for a wonderful outing.The outdoor exhibits, which are free to wander around and observe, capture archaeology in action. You can join a tour if you get a museum entrance pass or you can luck in a join a group as they wander around outside. We choose not to take a tour, rather listen in at various points when one walked by. The guides are quite entertaining with lots of information.The museum itself is good an it does an excellent job of highlighting the history of the finds in the tar pits. The 3D video is a must see. It does an excellent job of bringing it all together as well as educating one about where we are with the planet.My thoughts are 2-3 hours at the Tar Pits and another 2-3 hours at LACMA. Parking is a flat fee so get your full value. Also, plan to spend some time enjoying the park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SenorGancho
40,"16 year old ended up happy to be ""stuck"" going here","Fair price for admission. Very detailed timeline of how the tar pits were formed, worked in, and made into the attraction it is now. My 16 year old was very surprised to be able to touch a real leg from the pit. We did not do the extra areas. It is an amazing sight to see. They have workers and volunteers still going through the pits looking for more bones. You can actually go into a shack and see the pit at work. Parking cost more than expected, $12.00",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/68XXX70
40,Really cool history in downtown LA,We toured the museum in addition to a walk through the park. The museum is very interesting with quite a few impressive displays. Amazing the number of fossils came from the tar pits in the area. Interesting history of the area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/_TAO-0o0-
40,Stay for the Ice Age Encounters,"My family and I really enjoyed this place and the museum, not to mention the Ice Age Encounters show. It 's cost can add up (parking and tickets, the 3D movie) if you have a big family but I think its worth the fees. I have done this site on our own and with the guided tour. I highly recommend following along with the tour guide. Its so much more informative of course, but it also gives you insights and a few jokes here and there, plus kids get to answer questions. Don't bother trying to find parking on the side streets...not an impossible task but difficult especially during busy weekends and nice sunny days that draw out big crowds. Parking in their own lot in the rear just makes it convenient and one less thing to worry about regarding time. They are located on a nice large field, so you can bring a blanket and spend some time people watching or relaxing. Some kids soccer teams practice in the grassy area, if that bothers you, then beware. Otherwise, it makes it for a very adorable show of 3-4 year olds learning how to play. Other museums are near by, just a few miles away so fitting it in along with another museum for the day is doable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DonaEspie
50,Interesting for the entire family.,Beautiful park to walk around and the bonus is the history of the tar pits. The museum was very interesting but does have a charge but worth it. To view the tar pits / ponds is free. Teens enjoyed it and is educational.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/158timj
50,Afternoon trip in los angeles,We had seen this place from a bus so decided to give it a go. It only takes a few hours but is well laid out and informative. Never seen anywhere like it in the world so glad we took the time to visit. Having an indoor area helps beat the heat. Only gripe is that food and drink are at the art museum and there is nothing on zite,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/douglap54
50,History is alive and explained!,"Allocate about 2-3 hours. Take time to follow the path the museum presents to you, so it is easily explained to those with you. Amazing to think this is the only tar pits in the world in a major US city!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/710triciab
40,Great little museum for kids,"Any kid who's watched and loved the Ice Age movies (and those who haven't) will like this museum, filled with skulls and a great movie explaining the era. Older kids will appreciate the ongoing archeological dig sites, younger ones can just poke at the tar coming out of the ground with sticks. Good for the whole family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michellegO441YP
50,Very educational.,This museum was very fascinating and educational experience. It's interesting to see what they have recovered from the tar pits and what they're still working on.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tiffanya976
40,So incredible,If your looking for a museum of this type you can't go wrong. For FREE you can walk the exhibits outside which were all of the actual active tar pits from which they recovered every single artifact in the museum. There is also a very informative talk which happens at several of the spots. The food and drinks are easily accessible but very pricey as to be expected. Didn't have time to go inside for a tour but have in the past and found them long and slow but very informative.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Familyfun4us2013
50,Very interesting attraction,We loved our visit here. We took our 10 year old grandson as well as a 3 year old and they both enjoyed the movie and the exhibits. It is hard to believe that it is in the middle of LA and that you can still smell the tar. Great place for 3 hours or so.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShereeS98
40,"Tar Pits Great, Museum Needs More!","The tar pits area and park is great and interesting, however the museum is lacking some more exhibits.

Well worth the visit, especially in conjunction with the LA County Museum of Art.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PowerTrippersTravel
40,Excellent museum and history of the LA area,"We visited the LA Brea Tar Pits & Museum on our trip to LA. This is a great way to spend 2 or 3 hours and immerse yourself in the history of LA. The tar pits are open to the public ( no ticket needed), but the museum puts the history into perspective, where you learn what happened over hundreds even thousands of years from the Iast Ice Age to the present. Definitely recommended for a half day outing. .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/franke561
40,Giangantic woolly mammoth,"My family and I visited the La Brea Tar Pits and Museum. We found that the La Brea Tar Pits helped many scientists learn about the ice age, the tar pits seem to help my family learn about the ice age too. Many animal skeletons were found stuck in the tar pits, and I found it interesting that only one human skeleton was found out of the many various organisms discovered, which was a woman. One amazing part was the colossal skeleton of a woolly mammoth which we awed over. The gift shop was really cute, with lots of interesting little prizes. All of the employees were very friendly and helpful. We then visited the actual tar pits themselves, of which there many, and I found it incredible that we were standing where ancient creatures once stood many years ago, only to be trapped hunting for food in the tar pits. We also checked out where scientists were still excavating. They were behind a glass window, where they examined and sorted the bones. They are constantly finding more every day. In conclusion, The La Brea Tar Pits and Museum is a fun & interesting place to spend the day at.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MatthewJ566
40,Unique Museum,This was our 2nd time visiting. It is a unique and interesting place to visit. It is cool to see what all they have found and are still finding. We got in for free using our local museum membership since they are a partner which made our trip extra great. One of my kids favorite parts was seeing the cones where they have found even more tar coming our of the ground. They also loved watching the people at work finding and cleaning the bones. The gift shop is also fun to look at.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amyw2012
50,Recovery of ice age bones in tar.,"Most were animals who got trapped in the tar. Only one paial remains from a human were found, carbn dated 10,000 yrs ago !Most remainss were dated at last iceage & warm up as iended., Great video, easy for all ages to see what happenned here. Out side, researchers were seen working to free bone from tar. As one walks around, there a driving cones set out where tar is osing to the surface. iside were exibits & info, as well as one ould watch researchers working to free tiny bnes behind glass. It is an amaazing history of life back in time",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bateach3
50,Dino-Mite!,"Visited the La Brea Tar Pits and Museum on the 5th of July. I was fascinated by the work being performed and what has already occurred. A gentleman working on the site in front of one of the pits was nice enough to point out what they were working on and give a ""small talk"" on the pits' history. We walked further on to the larger pits in front of the museum ad took more photos. In the museum we read/looked at information regarding the fossils and remains of saber toothed tigers, dire wolves, mammoths, birds and even one human. My husband said I ""nerded-out"" for a couple of hours on him, but he enjoyed it too especially because I was so happy 😁. Great place for all to go!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/106sheryl
50,Not to be missed,"I have heard about the La Brea Tar Pits for years and have always wanted to visit them. I was not disappointed. There are actual active pits to be seen, excavations ongoing, and a terrific museum. The museum displays many of the thousands of finds from the pits, dug out over the last one hundred years. Some of the animals are recreated and come alive beautifully. There is also a great history of the pits and the use of the tar down the ages. Don't miss the story of the man who had the vision for the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/packedlite
50,La Brea Tar Pits and Museum,"If you love museums and history as I do, I feel that this is a good place to go. Even though I live over 40 miles away, I make a point of see this from time to time. I also believe this can be a good learning experience for kids, I brought my kids and grandkids for a visit.I am not crazy about the parking, bias on my part.On the con side, I did not like the eateries in the surrounding area. I found them expensive for the food and service I received.I had to leave the area to have food that I liked.But, the museum it self is great, in my opinion.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marcopQ2910OR
50,La Brea Tar Pits - the most extensive collection of fossils anywhere.,"This museum and working science center is in the heart of the mid-Wilshire area near the Los Angeles County art museum complexes on Wilshire Boulevard, a few blocks east of Fairfax. The Paige Museum is home to saber tooth tigers, wooly mamoths, giant sloths and other animals from an age long past. The collection of fossils is one of the largest in the nation and the exhibits, films and tar pit experience are worth exploring. Been going there since I was a kid and always enjoyed it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I3494FTrobertr
50,This place will freak you out!,"Hot tar bubbling up through the ground. Mastadon's, sabre tooth tigers, wolves all trapped in the tar, all reconstructed for your viewing pleasure. Bring the kids, they will learn something while being entertained.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Imorr55
40,"A bit smelly, but worth a quick visit","Our family of five, kids ages 15, 12 and 9 visited the La Brea Tar Pits in June 2017. The exterior portion is free, only the museum has an admission fee. We paid $12 for parking and chose to skip entering the museum. It is neat to see the bubbles coming to the surface and bursting in the huge petroleum pit. It was very cool that the excavation site is open to the public for viewing. We could see how the geologists had created a grid and worked their way through the matrix to free the fossils of ancient animals in order to learn more about this area. It was educational, but not overly academic so that it was enjoyable for our kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X1513WDlisac
40,Educational,Good place to visit and learn about the ice age impact in the Los Angeles area. Very educational. I took my toddler with me and he was amazed at the bone structures. He was a bit frighten by the big mammoth that was moving. This was my first time going and I recommend this place to all local. It's a hidden gem full of history. You can even see the scientist searching for prehistory animal bones. The saber tooth cat and the wooly mammoth are the main attractions.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Global647820
40,Neat,"This place is unique, fun, and a real learning experience. BUT, having said that, I wish I had read these reviews first because I agree (and I hate to say it BUT...) skip paying for the museum. This exhibit is just as cool if you want to just tool around the grounds. Inside there are a few cool old bones, but not very many and really not enough to justify the entry fee. I hate to say that but it is true.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PureMiPuraVidaATL
40,La Brea Tar Pits with teena,Nice natural history tour. We did a self guided tour. Might have been better with a guide. Parking is different so we took Uber. Arrive early to avoid crowds. Adjacent to LACMA. It would be good to plan to visit both while already there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/604andyw
40,Kids loved it !,"Today I took my 2 kids (8 and 6 years old) and their cousin (4 years old) to the La Brea Tar Pits. I thought the 3 boys would love seeing the dinosaur bones...and I was right, they loved it. We got there at about 11am on what was a super hot day (96 F). The first thing we did was to see the big lake in front of the museum. There were 4 mammoth elephants in the water in the lake. As we read about the lake, it seems that there is water on the surface of the lake but just a few feet below was pure sticky black tar. Given that it was baking hot outside, the kids immediately wanted to go into the museum to seek shelter in the air conditioned environment. Once we were in there, we got to see and learn about several of the animals that died during the Ice Age. Apparenly most of the animals were wolves trying to eat the animals that got stuck in the star. You will see wolves, elephants (mascedons spelling ?) and sabre tooth tigers. Overall, they loved going there and wanted to stay longer...It's not a huge museum...I think 2 hours is plenty of time...We ate at the art museum next to the La Brea tar pits...don't do it...it was SUPER expensive !!! They made Disneyland look cheap !!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Combatfisher
30,Skip the museum!,"The tar pits have been long been on my bucket list and unfortunately did not live up to my expectations. The museum is actually quite small and the skeletons have visible cobwebs. The animatronics remind me of the bad Chuck E Cheese robots from my childhood. The coolest things in the museum are probably the wall of dire wolf skulls and the tar container that shows you just how much muscle is need to free yourself from tar. The $12 price tag is not worth it and should be $6-8 at most.It IS worth it to take a quick walk around the grounds, which is free! You can walk around the actual tar pits and the area is nicely landscaped with plenty of lovely flowers. You can also see the paleontologists working on fossils under tents outside. You can pick up one of the cones on the ground, see the tar bubbling up, and poke it with a stick - that was my favorite part of the whole visit. The pits are right next to LACMA which has several outdoor displays that are also worth checking out - free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/darthgrim
40,"Fascinating place to visit, well worth seeing","This was a great way to see some amazing fossils that are still being collected. Easy to get to as it is in central LA, really good museum and site. A bit small and done in a couple of hours but you won't see anything like this elsewhere so worth seeing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scottb869
50,Fun and educational,"I was afraid our teenagers would be bored, but they were completely engaged. You can watch scientists in action as well as on-going excavations. Be sure to watch the 3D film before walking through the museum and pits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KarenC344
40,Tar Pits with a slice of Jazz!,Although the La Brea Tar Pits have numerous exhibits pertaining to the tar pits on Saturdays in the summer they have free jazz concerts in the park. It is a great place to meet friends and share food and drinks while listening to great music.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarcM1937
40,"Very good, light and educational.","Place is easy to get in, no lines. Slightly overpriced, but good educational visit for kids. I would recommend to watch their 3D show first, then see fossils.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/taraskucher
50,Amazing glimpse of the past,"If you're into history or archeology, you should check this out. In addition to seeing the actual pits where archeological excavation is underway, you can also see into the lab where scientists are cleaning and identifying the various specimens.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ImaPickyTraveller
50,Small but interesting,"Brought our 6 and 7 year old to visit. They were pretty amazed at all the bones that have been found in the pits. They also enjoyed walking around the property poking sticks into the bubbling tar.Was a fun visit. Spent about an hour in the museum, then walked around outside and explored. LA Museum of Art is close by, so we also visited their outdoor exhibits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BECAddo
40,Fun and informative trip!,"Had a blast at La Brea! I don't think we expected much for the price (10 bucks), but ended up much wiser and smiling after the visit. Great stop on our bus tour!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jimboj727
50,"""A must visit""","Now being summer break for the kids, take them to this museum. It's easy to get to off the 101 fwy. You can have lunch there and spend the day enjoying the museum and tar pits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/165Oldtimer
40,Fun place to visit,"This is a great park and museum to visit! Very informational exhibits and a beautiful park. It's also in a great location, close to the art museum and within walking distance to the Grove and the Farmer's Market.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luckyno39
50,Interesting place!,"Didn't know much about tar pits before we went here, but we sure learned a lot. The museum is interesting--especially the wolf skulls and the contraption where you feel what it's like to be stuck in tar. You can walk around the park and see excavations underway. Well worth an hour's visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cheeseheadfamilyof4
50,Great Place for the Kid who loves Dinosaurs,Right smack in the middle of LA is this little gem. So if you have some one who likes old bones. Then you will find this a real gem of a place.Hints The Staff are really knowledgeable. Parking can be a bear but hey its LA! There are a lot of fast food joints nearby. But since it is LA it is a very hot spot and the tar does give off a lot of nasty smells.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidlB7915GV
50,Amazing and easy access,"We walked the grounds and skipped the museum (zero opinion about the museum). It was both amazing and underwhelming. You want it to be more set in the wild, rather than a block in central LA but that adds to the wonder as well. This place was once this wild and in this little space it still is.Worth wandering and reading about it and that costs you absolutely nothing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ElizabethVonDacey
40,Show me the Saber Tooth!,"I have wanted to visit the La Brea Tar Pits since I was a kid... let's just say that was a few decades ago. I finally had the opportunity in September of 2016. I will say that it was not all I thought it was going to be. I'd envisioned walkways across the open pits of tar and a substantial museum housing the hundreds and thousands of finds from the pits. There were pits and some were viewable behind glass, the were a few outdoor pits viewable behind bars, and there was a moderately-sized museum (the George Page museum) that featured some of the significant pit finds and some fantastic exhibits. This was all in the confines of a park-like area, complete with people laying in the grass, and a garden as well. All in all it was a great little museum that every budding archaeologist and/or paleontologist should visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/roberthhunter
50,La Brea Tar Pits - very interesting,"The tar pits are quite interesting and you can actually see them bubbling quite easily - some of the bubbling is soft but other areas are quite ""violent"". There is a smell though that goes with being at the tar pits but it is not overly unpleasant.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ParadiseW2017
50,GREAT for Kids! Must Go,"Went to La Brea Tar Pits with the family (wife and 3 kids 8-12yo)...what a great experience! I know millions of people have been here, but I had not been here since I was a young child (maybe 30 years ago), and was really looking forward to showing the kids. The price is VERY reasonable at $12 for general admission. They always have a few events or activities on the calendar that they charge extra for, but they are reasonable ads-ons as I only spent about $4 more per person.Parking is nearby, but is $12 so be aware of that.La Brea is really split into 2 distinct areas...the Museum, and the Park. The park is REALLY interesting as that is where the actual ""tar pits"" are located. There is a lot to see out there including Project 23, an active project they are digging right now.Overall the Museum is amazing, lots of exhibits that are of the highest quality and great people that work there doing tours etc.You could easily spend about 6 hours doing both the park and museum together.Overall, highly recommended, especially for the kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1776Gear
50,A must see...,"Both the museum and the grounds around it are very interesting and educational. Appropriate for all ages in a convenient, easy to access location .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/412suzih
40,"Cool tar pits, but dated museum","Visiting the La Brea Tar Pits was fun because it's someplace my grandma and my dad both remember visiting when they were young. It runs right up to the LACMA too, so you could easily visit both in the same day. The pits themselves were interesting to see, although we didn't feel the need to walk around and see all of them. The museum had bones they'd pulled out of the pits, and explained a lot about the history of the pits. It was, however, fairly small, and a little tired looking. This is a site that's been renovated a lot over time, and I think it's maybe time to redo the museum. There weren't very many digital or interactive spaces, which are becoming increasingly important in keeping a museum relevant and engaging (in my opinion anyway.) There were some dated animatronic mammoths and sabertooth tigers, which might engage the youngest visitors for a few minutes. Overall, it was interesting, and I really did enjoy seeing the bones. (Mammoths are seriously HUGE!) But it was a bit dated (not in information content - to my knowledge - but in display.)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pingin505
30,"Interesting, but not quite ""Wow!""","We were in town to see a concert and visited the tar pits during the day. It was very interesting to see, but not super spectacular. If you don't want to spend the money to go in the museum, you will have just as interesting a time walking the grounds. Check out the pit where they are actively digging. Wonder why they need 5 million plus fossils and when do you stop? Walk a few blocks over to the Farmer's Market on 3rd for lunch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/avidwalker
40,Natural history right in downtown LA,"Have always wanted to go here after reading about the tar pits as a kid. I was surprised just how central they are--one of the street boundaries of the park is Wilshire Boulevard. Pretty good exhibits, although a little dated. Still good for the science geek in everyone. I particularly liked seeing the ""active"" tar pit outside, had asphalt floating on the top with methane bubbling up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tarzan2613
20,Not what I expected,"We stopped by La Brea Tar Pits during our tour of LA. As we walked into the park area the stench was unbearable (my kids were grossed out) there was also a ranting homeless man walking in and out of the area , cursing and yelling the entire time . We walked around the grounds , took a couple of pics to say we had been there but we honestly didn't see anything very interesting . The boiling pits in the water were few and not as dramatic as I had anticipated. We did not venture into the museum. Maybe there was a WOW factor in there , not sure . I didn't expect it to be located within the city , I was expecting it to be off in a rural area or something . I also anticipated more pits and larger ones. At least we can say we were there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Culinayart1
30,Disappointed,The museum is very nice. The tar pits were a disappointment. Geologically significant but not as interesting as I had hoped for.... I've read the other reviews and I'm the anomaly as most people love it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/binkley007
50,A great afternoon,"We spent an hour and a half here, it really makes one feel a little Insignificant in relation to the whole universe and the past 38,000 years especially.. this is an amazing exhibit and is so worth the time it takes to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Edleg
50,An oasis of peace and information in the city,"Loved this - wonderfully helpful staff, amazing information and a great amount of displaysDont miss the video",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/879gaila
40,Travel back in time.,"I found this experience very unique. At least for me, it was the first time I laid my eyes on a tar pit. I only knew them from National Geographic channel. I imagined sabre tooth tigers and woolly mammoths finding their untimely death at the bottom. And indeed, if you visit the museum, you will find this to be the case. The tar pit is free, but the museum requires a fee. It is very informative, you will find information on tar pits themselves, all the fossils found in them, as well as the tiring task of the scientists categorising them. I loved learning about the tar pits and the animals of the time, but the museum could have been a bit more entertaining. After a while all the reading became a bit boring.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/whyitripped
50,Ancient History Among the Skyscrapers,"Went to the Tar Pits with grandchildren, aged 10 and 7. Hadn't been there in over 30 years, and it has improved. Parking is pricey, but very convenient, not only to the Tar Pits, but also for the Fine Arts Museum and the Peterson Automotive Museum. The kids loved it! There is a lot there that will keep everyone interested. The Tar pits themselves are still active, and you can watch the bubbles from the gasses break the thick, black liquid surface. In the museum, they have the fossils of mastodon and mammoth, sabre tooth cat and sloth. The robotic mammoth fascinated my granddaughter, who still jumped when it ""moved"" in her direction. The 3D show is good, as is the live discussion of the sabre tooth with a ""real"" sabre tooth cat walking about in front of the audience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RussellD359
50,Home of many Dire Wolves!,"We chose to go to the tar pits early one morning and was not disappointing! There are many pits to see outside, including an active dig site (Pit 91) and a site where they are going thru all the crates from a previous dig. The outdoor exhibits are well done and the park itself is very nicely maintained. Definitely bring your walking shoes and water - if it's a sunny day it gets hot quick! The indoor part of the museum was equally as cool. There are many exhibits showing a lot of the different fossils that have been found in the pits, as well as a good bit of history of the site itself. It's amazing how many Dire Wolves they've found, and they've put together a pretty impressive display showing off just how many.There's even a section of the museum where you can see volunteers sorting through the boxes picking out bone / fossils from debris. I'd be sure to add this one to your list of places to go. It would be much better to do on a dry day, but the museum could kill an hour or so if the weather isn't accommodating.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/catchthis0905
50,Prehistoric wonder,See animals that were preserved in the tar pits. Take tone of the tours around the property and see numerous pits that are still yielding discoveries. Great way for kids and adults to see history.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarolW186
50,Good visit,We hadn't a clue what this was about when we went in. It is a great little site right in the heart of the city and well worth a half day spent looking around. They are still working on the site so you can see them excavating and cleaning up the fossils they are recovering. The museum is well presented and there are volunteers around who are more than willing o share their knledge with you.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SergeantRoo
50,Interesting and educational,We spent about 2 hours here recently and found it very educational. It is really presents a fascinating history of the tar pits and the many fossils found in the pits. We very much enjoyed the visit as like to learn about fossils and prehistoric life.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KipDylan
50,Educational and fun,We have been wanting to go here for years and never got around to it. I don't know why we waited so long! We had such a nice time walking around. The grounds are beautiful. We followed the map to all of the different pits and the museum. The museum was my family's favorite part. All of the animals on the inside have been found in the tar pits. The museum was very educational and I think we all left with something new we had learned. It was a nice way to spend and afternoon.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karenm502
40,La Brea =The Tar,"Didn't know until we went there that ""La Brea"" means ""the Tar"". The bubbling tar pits are enclosed by a fence that is circled by a walking path. It's a nice walk around the pits to the museum where you can see a saber toothed tiger and mammoths and read about the history of the area. Excavation sites are around the facility so you can see what scientists are still finding in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/volturnus
50,history,"you really do not have to love prehistoric history to enjoy this museum, its for everyone, parking is free once you purchase your entrance ticket, walk around the ground and join a free tour then see the museum grounds, it should take 2.5 hrs to see everything, great to actually see scientists dig up fossils and sabre tooth tiger bones right in front of you, exhibits are easy to read and informative",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mulgrew
50,The most unusual museum in Los Angeles,The La Brea Tar Pits and Museum is a great place to spend a few hours and learn what it was like for animals to live thousands of years ago. The Tar Pits are very much alive with activity and kind of reminds me of seeing an somewhat active volcano as the tar still flows and the scientists still find great treasures every day. The museum is small but worth the visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/howardt707
40,Tar age,This was definitely an educational tour. The exhibits were well placed and informative. I was happy that most of the peices were real fosils and remains. It was so cool to see the live processing of samples taken from the very site.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lendyl
40,"Unique and educational, neat to see","My son is an animal nut, and he especially loves learning about prehistoric animal life. This was a stop booked especially for him, but we all loved it. We did arrive late in the day, due to a hectic vacation schedule and some last minute unexpected events. We arrived with about an hour left before the museum closed, but were pleasantly surprised to learn the tar pits themselves were open much later. This was a relief, and we felt more relaxed. Firstly, the staff at the ticket booth was wonderful, so nice. We received first visit buttons and were on our way. We headed to the museum first, and were able to go through 2 full times before closing without feeling rushed. They have staff working with fossils inside in a viewing area. With my animal lover, we spent some time and money in the gift shop and got some unique souvenirs for our trip. We then headed outside to the pits. It was so neat to see them bubbling up, and easy to imagine how they had been long ago. The ground still actively bubbles in several places! We were too late to see the active digging in the site, but you could still see the tools and what they were working on. It was nice, and unexpected in the middle of LA. A great visit, and I wish we had been able to make it earlier in the day to see the workers in the pits. We still left very happy :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Devyn_11
50,Informative and interesting,Hubby and I brought our 8 month old grandson here for an outing. I think we got more out of it than he did. Great setting to walk around. The information provided is really helpful. Amenities are well provided. Great place to spend a couple of hours.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nina-1561
50,Great family attraction,"The tar pits have parking available but it is not cheap. Plan on arriving at the opening time and you can get parking on the street right North side of the pits. This parking is metered so make sure to take change and keep track of when your meter will expire, but it is so much cheaper than parking in their lot.It is free to walk around the grounds and see the different pits, but the best part of the attraction is in the museum. It is definitely worth the admission price. Did not know if my teenage son would like looking through the museum but he did very much and wants to go back. The museum traces the history of the pits and has a large collection of Ice Age animal skeltons that were trapped in the tar. including a number of Mastadons.Plan on about an hour to get through the museum and another half our to hour to go around the grounds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/moiHere
40,1st Tuesday is free admission,"It's not just that we are a family of history and science nerds. The fact that there is an Ice Age tar pit smack in the middle of a huge city is just too interesting to miss. It's small, it's well maintained, and it's free admission on the first Tuesday of the month. The kids especially enjoyed watching the live excavations that still go on even after all this time, and the mammoth exhibit. I'm still in awe of the saber tooth fossils and the entire wall of dire wolf skulls that have been retrieved from the pit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SMB378
50,A short but very interesting place,"Went with our 7, 4 and 1.5 yr olds. They loved it. But mostly the Husby and I loved it.We learned so much. I loved the layout of the museum, it is a short visit. we played out on the grass and strolled around the lake. Walked over to area 23 and took pictures, thought about venturing to the art museum but passed as the day was getting late. We had a relaxing visit to a beautiful part of LA. Highly recommend visiting this park and museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KellyLLouisee
30,Unique and worth visiting for a quick afternoon tour but starting to age,"The La Brea Tar Pits is one of the more unique and iconic museums in LA as it's the only natural history museum I know of that is dedicated to the ice age area. The fact that all the bones there have been pulled directly from the tar pits outside is fascinating and it's neat to watch the volunteers who continue to clean and identify bones and fragments in their lab.The museum itself is relatively small and you won't need more than an hour - two tops. Unfortunately given that many of the museums in the region have been updated in the last ten years, the style and content of the museum itself will feel dated for adults. That being said I imagine any 3 to 10 year old will be interested. The park setting outside is a nice compliment and a great place to just sit on an warm afternoon as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chillclimber
50,Srange but true,"The idea that there is tar (actually a low grade petroleum similar to asphalt) bubbling up in the center of a metropolis seems like something out of a comic book, but it's true. The tar pits just off Wilshire Blvd. have been there for thousands of years, trapping mastodons, sabre-toothed tigers, birds, ground sloths, and a wide variety other animals, as well as plants and insects during that time. Inside the museum, you can see the story of this area, from the Pleistocene Age to today. Around the grounds of the museum you can see active excavations underway where fossils are still being found. If you want to avoid the school field trippers, go here in the late afternoon or during the weekend. This is a place you have to visit when you are in LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidaI5710FE
50,Very educational,"Easy to get to. We learnt a lot about extinct animals via a 3D movie, the easy walking tour around the compound was very good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarolR2820
50,Worth seeing,This small museum is actually well worth seeing .. watching the tar still bubbling up and the smell of the tar .. and inside the museum they play a short but very interesting movie it's well worth it .. parents with young kids will love it ..,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/unclechownza
30,Worth a walk.,"If you are at LACMA or otherwise in the neighborhood, stop by the park where the Tar Pits are located. It is a fascinating look at the pits in which so many prehistoric animals and people were trapped.There is a somewhat bizarre outdoor sculpture of a family of mammoths, with one being trapped by the tar.There is also an indoor museum with skeletons found in excavations on the site. The museum is small and the collection is ok. The animatronic animals are a joke. You can safely skip the museum. But, definitely take a walk around the park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/utpsy
50,A blast to the past,"I had been to the La Brea Tar Pits as a child in the '60s. I remembered loving them and may even attribute my geology major in college in part to that love. When I returned with my husband, who hadn't been there, I wasn't sure what to expect, but I was not disappointed. The place is fantastic and the Page Museum, which wasn't built until the '70s, makes it even better! We spent several hours reading the signs and really studying all the fossils that were on display. My husband loved it too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Maps804493
40,An Interesting Outdoor Museum in an Urban Setting,"This is the only tar pit in the world that is in an urban area - that in itself is a good reason to visit. The grounds are quite lively, well taken care of. We liked seeing the bubbling water when the methane gas escapes. Parking is pretty steep for a short visit - $12. We didn't go into look at the fossils because we had limited time, but we did enjoy seeing the current archeological dig.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/teachers55
40,Interesting and unique,"La Brea was an interesting place. We took a tour and our guide explained all the different exhibits it had to offer. In the museum you can watch people working on current digs, which was very cool. We also stayed for the 3D movie that explained how the animals became trapped in the pits. We were with our sister's family, who also bought tickets to the 3D show, but there were not enough seats for them so they never got to see it. Be sure you get in line early so you get a seat! My family enjoyed it but we felt it was a bit expensive for the 5 of us.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KimSIdaho
50,Unusual - to say the least!,"This is a unique interesting museum / park. The tar pits are weird, but interesting and the museum's fossils (from the excavations on site) are superb.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/906beckyv
50,Jewel in the heart of LA,"Did you know this is a natural landmark? It's been here for thousands of years.I wouldn't have even known about it if not for my friend from Australia! 🇦🇺It's amazing and a must see!La Brea Tar Pits is a National Natural Landmark and it's in the heart of LA, California USA 🇺🇸",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelWithMira
50,Wonderful time,La Brea is such a fun place to spend the day. So many exhibits and lots of interesting information. There are people working there that wander around and are available to give additional information which is very helpful. Had a great time!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paranoidgirl1013
50,Unique Landmark,"We did not have time to visit the museum, but we were still able to view all of the tar pits and learn about the history and discoveries made at the site. The pathways between each pit are well-marked and provide for a lovely walk in a ""park"" located in the midst of Hollywood high rises. Also, we were able to see paleontologists inspecting pieces of hardened tar for fossils. I would highly recommend walking around the park if you would like to see the tar pits but do not have time or the interest to visit the museum.Note about Parking: It costs $12.00 to park in the museum's parking lot, but we parked in a residential area located a few blocks away. Be mindful of the signs posted on these side streets, however, because it may be illegal to park there at certain times of the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/500morganp
40,Just See It!,"I have been wanting to go there since I was kid (I am 60 now). Well, a bit underwhelming and we just skipped the museum since it was $12 a head and checked out the park with the tar pits. Still fun anyway.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/coachee1313
30,Simply awesome 😎!,Great place for after dinner strolls. Interesting to learn how an old oil fill has been preserved and is helping to tell the story of tar.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sandaykc1
50,Walk,Super cool place to visit and walk around lots of Pokemon stops if you play. Lots of photos ops. LACMA is next door. So you can walk there too,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/toniat701
40,Nice stop in central LA,The La Brea Tar Pits are a great place to visit in the vastness of central LA. The park itself is free except parking. Nice area with food trucks a cross the street for a meal.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Baja001
50,"Liked the bones, loved the plants","Being a plant gal, the Pleistocene Garden was my favorite part of my visit. The garden is filled with plants that had seeds stuck in the ""tar"". Of course, those seeds weren't viable but the plants in this garden are still found in California today. There was a staff member and a volunteer who both seemed very excited about working on the garden. The tar pits weren't what I expected (I had visions of huge shiny black lakes) but I was fascinated watching the bubbles inflate and deflate. There were people working at cleaning fossils, an active pit site being worked, lots of bones that were found in the actual pits (including one you could touch) and some volunteers using a paint brush separating out bits of bone from a handful of what looked like large sand pieces. All the staff was extremely friendly and helpful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thymegrower
50,Amazing!,"Be sure to watch the 40 minute video, narrated by Morgan Freeman - it explains how the animals ended up in the tar pits. Really an interesting way to spend a few hours by wandering around the tar pits, which are still bubbling tar as they have done for the past 40,000 years.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bnitzberg
50,Lovely setting on the Golden Mile.,"This is right next door to LACMA and has beautiful grounds and things to see on the outside and of course the indoor exhibits showcase the large animals and all wildlife that lived here 40,000 years ago and coming forward to today. It is a fascinating museum and is great for all ages.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elliotr977
50,Fantastic learning experience,Lots of space for young children to run. The pits are sectioned off for safety reasons but the view and the smell are intact! Fascinating displays showing how the artifacts are retrieved from the pits. The museum has some great skeletons. I would skip this on a hot day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JaniceG2
40,Pretty Neat,"We really enjoyed walking around the tar pits. There were some active exhibits and the grounds were nicely kept. Certainly not something you see (or smell) every day. We didn't think we could do the entire museum justice, so ours was an outside tour only.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ace4444
30,"They are scientifically significant,but... just a lake of tar!","We walked down from the Museum of Art to see the tar pits and it is very interesting that they are just still ... there. A lake of tar in the center of the busy downtown of a giant and modern cit. To be fair, we did NOT take the time to go through the museum, which I am sure adds to the experience. But in the end, what you are looking at in the actual park is just a lake of tar. Cool, but I don't know if we would make a special trip to see it. But it is very close to other things, so an easy few blocks' walk to check out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ReesS
50,The Ice Age brought to life,"The Le Brea tar pit museum and tour is a must for anyone visiting LA. A working archeological site, the museum showcases the many ice age fossils collected in the tar pits as well as the opportunity to see current excavations.The excavators tour is definitely worth the time and the guides are exceptionally knowledgable and engaging.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amandarK201NO
40,A unique place,I have never seen a tar pits before. I learned many things from this place. It's a good place to expand my knowledge.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/patrickls2014
50,Excellent,we visited this with my family and some extended family my daughter in law is from guatemala and new to the US and the tour guide acknowledged each different state and each different country..our other extended family were from different states the museum and everything presented were very interesting and fun for everyone unforgettable time...we learned later our tour guide was doing her first tour and we would not have known that had someone not told us!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Terrie113
50,What a cool place!!,We got the passport tickets which allowed us to go to the 2 movie/shows and the museum. We also went on a free guided tour of the pits. It is so unbelievably amazing that this ice age sight is right in the Wilshire District! All of the explanations and information was so easily understood and there were guides and docents everywhere to answer questions. A must see!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M824EAcarols
40,Interesting Pace That's Not Expensive,"This was my first time to the Tar Pits. The cost of admission and a 3D film and a short show is $19. It has actual fossils from the pits. U can walk around and see the pits where excavation is still going on. There are plenty of photo ops of the various ice age creatures such as full scale mamonths, saber tooth tigers etc. Definitely worth going. They have a small gift shop but no restaurant.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ronnie333_3
40,Interesting,My husband and I visited the tar pits but didn't go into the museum. There is no charge to visit the tar pits but there is a $15 parking fee. There are a number of areas to see the tar bubbling. There are some interpretive signs and you can see relics being excavated and scientists working. It is situated in a beautiful park like setting. The LAMCC is also located here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nancym616
40,Worth a walk through,"We didn't visit the Museum. Plenty of information to read walking through the park lands, watching the tar pits bubble. Bit stinky but all part of the experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LOZQLD
50,A must see for science enthusiasts,"Very cool place. The number of bones/fossils and artifacts they have found here is amazing, and the museum does a nice job of displaying them. It took us about 2 hrs to see everything, including both shows.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/escape_the_cold
40,Interesting!,"I was feeling ill on my LA trip and needed a slower-paced activity to fill our time. I really enjoyed the Tar Pits. We visited the museum first. There's ALOT of reading and it might not be engaging for young children. If you're a museum-type, this is absolutely for you! We then mosey-ed outside and visited the grounds, saw the open pits, the archeology digs. It was an informative, interesting day, and I would totally go back! My favorite part was inside the museum, where you can watch volunteers clean off new finds! I thought the cost was appropriate for the time spent there (about 2.5 hours). I rated it 4 stars because the displays are not modern and probably wouldn't keep the attention of children under 14. The skeletons are pretty awesome, but they don't move or anything, and kids obviously can't climb them. We parked in a parking garage around the block.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clairesT5425RT
50,Fun and educational,This is a super interesting and educational spot. It's like living history. It is very rare to be able to be up close and personal with such an interesting piece of natural history!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/moreyc2015
40,Historic and Interesting,"When we visited, we didn't pay to go into the museum. We just walked around the place and read all the information boards, there's still plenty to learn by doing that. And of course we went to the main big pit and probably watched it for 20 mins or so, just waiting for bubbles to surface was strangely hypnotic",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bmflynn
50,Get a real sense of paleontology in action,"At the La Brea Tar Pits you can get a real sense of paleontology in action, not just what you saw watching the Jurassic Park movies. There are natural tar pits here that have been trapping unwary creatures for countless thousands of years. Here you can see how these are found, conserved, and studied. You don't have to spend all day here, but you can if you get interested enough.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/00Bruce00
40,Not as much as expected,"Visited on a weekday afternoon, after lunch.This was an ideal time, as school groups were leaving, so there were fewer visitors crowding the exhibits.Enjoyed the live tour guide at 1pm. Got to go inside one of the excavation pits that you can only access with a tour.3D Movie was just OK. Had to pay a separate admission. Very informative about the Tar Pits and its creation, but the theater was small and the effects were minimal.My five-year old son enjoyed seeing the re-creation of animals, such as the mammoth and the saber tooth tiger, that were robotic.Nice garden in the center of the museum.Having gone to the Natural History Museum first, I expected to see more. The museum does have a special live program on weekends, so to maximize one's admission, maybe I would go back on a weekend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GiantsFanLosAngeles
40,Interesting,"Tar has seeped up from the ground in this area for tens of thousands of years. The tar is often covered with dust, leaves, or water. Over many centuries, the bones of animals that were trapped in the tar were preserved. The George C. Page Museum is dedicated to researching the tar pits and displaying specimens from the animals that died there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Felixstowe2016
40,Museum and fossil excavation,The museum provides well displayed fossils and explanations. Staff are available to answer questions and provide details about exhibits. There is a 3D movie which is an additional cost besides the admission price.The park is pretty but the tar pits are the most interesting to see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ilene552015
40,Interesting History... But Beware the Stench,"As a bit of a nerd, me and my family enjoyed seeing the tar pits as we got to glimpse into history. However, as Kansans not used to the smell of tar we were at first a bit overwhelmed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SamanthaA001
50,Easy trip to a fascinating place!,"This stop is well worth seeing on your trip to LA. Located very close to downtown, it's an easy side trip that does not require much money or time. The museum is definitely worth seeing, to give you context and information about the site; however, you can still walk around the grounds and see the tar pits for free. You can spend as much time as you like but we were able to see it in under 2 hours, which made it a good morning filler in between other adventures. Good for kids too - they'll find it really cool!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ladygills
50,Amazing discovery for me!!!,"Well, I was not expecting what I saw here at all!!!! This was amazing!!!! O won't go into what I thought the tar pits were but it's a most interesting place. The tar still bubbles up in a very secure fenced in area. There is a short video describing what the tar pits are and how animals got stuck in the tar. This place is great for both kids and adults. Nice exhibits of some of the animals that got stuck in the tar and now are on exhibit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nancylucille
50,Interesting for all ages,"This is a very interesting museum where you can see scientist and excavators at work. It is easy to get to via public transport (bus). On a sunny day it is nice to walk around and see the tar pits first hand. I would advise taking a guided tour as this provides a lot of details you would miss otherwise and the history of the area. As there are so many things to see you can get a pass out so you can grab a bite to eat or a full meal - there are several restaurants and eateries very close by - then go back to the Pits. I saw several people with small children and all ages seemed to enjoy the place. I would also recommend going to see the show, it gives you a good introduction and history of the La Brea Tar Pits, kids will really enjoy it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janetf2013
50,A piece of history,This is an amazing and special piece of history. I traveled to LA when I was 10 years old and visiting the Tar Pits was my most vivid memory of the trip 20 years later. It is definitely a must see spot in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jsg0922
50,To see the tar is amazing!,"The outside walking area is so interesting. You can view tar pits, a working dig, a garden, and more. What an outside exhibit. There is also a museum with the skeletons of animals found in the tar pits. There is a working lab where you can view scientists working on fossils. There is a live show and 3D movie which explain the tar pits even better.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R1619YVpatc
40,Very Interesting!,Very interesting. Nice area to walk through. Worth the money for the museum if you have kids that love bones and paleontology. It's free to walk the grounds and see the tarpits. I recommend walking next door to LACMA as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/916stacieg
50,Very interesting,Very interesting. La Brea is no longer offered as part of free entry with the Chase Museum card. There are still a number of tar pits and you can see the methane gas bubbling up. Enjoyed the exhibits in the building. Lots of different animal fossils. Movie was just ok and can easily be skipped.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chitownsam
50,The Smell of the Tar,"Here we are in the middle of the hustle and bustle of Los Angeles. We pull into the parking lot of La Brea Tar Pits. You can smell the tar in the down wind and then you're transformed into an era when wooly mammoths and saber-toothed tigers lived. This attraction is very well done. You can see the tar pits bubbling and you can ""see"" a poor wooly mammoth stuck in the outside tar pit. The museum and the 3D IMAX movie are very interesting. I think what I liked the most was seeing a real paleontologist removing the tar from a skull. What a painstaking job!!!!!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SingingNut
40,A must see,This is a small museum so someone looking for something like the museum of natural history in new youth city will be disappointed. It's worth the $$ to take the tour which is very informative. The inside of the museum is very limited once you have seen all the skeletons that are on display. The outside grounds with active tar pits and archeological work going on to observe are facinating. Would probably be boring for little ones.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nancycA5997LT
50,Must see place to go!,Been here a number of times and learn something new each time.. Great place for kids and family to see these tar pits. Great historical location.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lincoln117
50,my husband love this site- always visits and takes people with him,so intersting to see this bit of prehistoric history smack in the middle of LA.. It makes history of science come alive. Easy to get to. right by the LACM and the fabulous auto museum. Requires a short visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dlsoduku
50,"Live bubbling tar pits and extensive, informative museum",The museum features the skeletons of extinct California animals found in the tar. You can also see biologists at work--they're inside a zoo-like glass enclosure. Near to the surprisingly good LA County Museum of Art. Has a parking lot.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulsS4151FO
20,Small & Nothing like the Pics Online,My friend wanted to go here after seeing the pics online which looked really cool but don't let that fool you. This place is SMALL! One small loop and you're done. Nothing really else to offer. For the price of $12 I would say its pretty pricey. If you want to see the 3D movie its another $16-19. The pits were all closed outside and the inside just had a few dinosaur skeletons.For the price I would not recommend it. Waste of time and energy. You will be done in less then an hour.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/459ammarat
50,A Must Visit,"My group and I had a wonderful trip to the pits without spending a dime, and I can only imagine how much more interesting and fun it would've been to grab some tickets and head to the inside exhibits. The grounds are beautiful and the pits with the mastodon statues are of course a must-see. The outside information booths are staffed by courteous employees and provide maps if desired. We were also able to head inside and visit the gift shop without purchasing tickets, which was great for picking up little souvenirs. Kids will probably get a kick out of the giant sloth/bear statues that are scattered around which also make nice photo ops.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jambles84
40,Different,"The layout of this attraction is unusual and interesting, not to mention informative.Worth a visit for an hour or so.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RonA_Plymouth
50,FASCINATING,"Interesting day out and well worth the trip. Hard to believe so many people miss this place, but it should be if not at the top, close to the top of your list.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mojaquera
10,Boring,"Looked really cool online, place was actually really boring. Don't get me wrong it's cool how they have dug up the bones but it's just boring.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jesseanne88
40,Interesting exhibits,"Exhibits are fairly interesting, and it's a good spot to spend a couple of hours. It's great for school kids, but in general I think most adults have ""been there, done that"".",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnnH685
30,A blast from the past,"It was totally cool to see the tarpits in person. We didn't go into the visitor's center, which may have improved our experience of learning about the history of the area. I felt like I could have learned more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LaPetiteAmber
50,What a great place to spend an hour,"Great place to see what happened in the past! You can get up close to the tar, wonderful place for the whole family",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SMBIker
50,Made a visit at last!!,Since I was very young I have wanted to visit the tar pits whilst staying with family each summer from the UK. but some unexpected event always prevented this.....but not this time!!! Many years later on a 39th Wedding Anniversary trip I finally made it and was not disappointed. The museum explains everything very well and the exhibits are fab. I noticed there is elevators available for parents with strollers or someone with mobility problems.If you are a lover of history and extinct animals make a trip! There are also some areas for having a picnic which we made use of. The LA County Museum of Art is next to the La Brae Tar Pits so it would be good to combine the two on one day,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TripDivaHampshireUK
50,"When Giants ruled the world 20,000 years ago","Amazing sight in the heart of LA. - an active ""dig"" revealing ancient bones from the Ice Age or before humans rules the Earth. 25 min video tells what walked the Earth 20,000 years ago. You should smell the Tar on the approach. You will learn about how California or the North American continent looked like before History started.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JackE430
50,Unexpectedly very cool,"So much more to do than just look at the pits (which is free). We got passes to the museum and really spent some time with the cool exhibits, some are interactive. The large mammoth and sloth skeletons with surely entertain kids and adults and there is a lot to be seen with the actively working archaeological teams going over bones live.Lots to learn about the LA area over 36,000 years to the present day.Would recommend to anyone who likes history OR science.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MegamanMidwest
50,Unique attraction in Los Angeles,Was not expecting to find such a interesting attraction here. Wonderful place for photos and fasicnating history.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Q3434JRalexk
40,Not the Peach Pit,"I visited the La brea tar pits in Los Angeles, Ca. The tar pits are located right by the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and you can easily spend half a day exploring the museum and then going to the tar pits. It's an interesting place to see a tar filled lake pit, but I won't go into the history about it. There is a museum located on the property that will explain everything you need to know. I suggest taking an Uber there because you have to pay for parking. The admission to enter the museum is 12$? I didn't know you had to pay to enter, I walked behind the building and merged with the rest of the tourists and saw the tar pit and everything outside, there is a sculpture garden located on the premises too and a nice shady walking path. I also entered the museum through the exit (thought it was the entrance) and explored the entire museum, free of charge.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rgd973
30,Interesting Attraction,"The La Brea Tar Pits are something to see, although the whole place is a little shop-worn looking. The movie is well-done, although it seems unnecessary to have it in 3-D. I found it surprising g that at the same time the first pyramids were being constructed, the last mastodons were dying. The museum here is rather rudimentary but you can watch scientists examining fossils under microscopes and you can see gas bubbles burping up in the various Tar Pits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DEngelJ
10,Not for adults,The concept is more relevant for children and it is pretty boring for you if you are an adult. Best would be to give this place a skip,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/901aayushk
40,Great Place for Kids,Brought my children here as a learning experience. The both had a great time. They enjoyed seeing the outdoor exhibit and the bits of tar still seeping up through the grass. I always appreciate affordable day trips for kids.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/erikadejesus25
30,Good for kids,It's not a place I would recommend if you are here just for a few days.. It shows how the fossils are being excavated from asphalt,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/siddhi261
40,Interesting Place.,We passed by the Tar Pits on our way to LACMA and i find it very interesting. The outside ground is vast and expect a bit of walk. It's interesting to smell the tar and see it coming out of the earth. Very near LACMA so you can visit both in one day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/averywildchild
50,Nice museum,"If you're into prehistoric mammals, this is the place for you. The Page Museum features fill size fossils of mammoths, saber tooth tigers, sloths and many other animals. The cool part is, ALL the fossils were excavated right there in the Hancock Park area. The tar pits are a natural resource to that area and tar can still be found under many structures along the Miracle Mile..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BDoubleU80
40,Fascinating natural history,"And right in the middle of Los Angeles. We did not visit the museum (next time?) but just walking around the grounds, seeing the oil oozing up out of the ground and methane gas bubbles forming and bursting on the surface of the ""lake"" - riveting. The history of the place is pretty interesting, too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GayeS545
40,Nice museum,Cool museum that displays a while variaty of different things that have to do with the tarpits and fossils. It's amazing to see how they keep on searching to discover more and more history! (And how patiently and meticulously they do it!),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kdw452
40,Prehistoric LA,"worth a visit. I mean dinosaurs in the middle of LA, tar pits, watch the staff working on excavated bones. It's a great place to get educated on dinos",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dandU5193DM
50,Smells like tar,Yes that was my first reaction. I do not suppose prehistoric animals were familiar with tar and its dangers. That is why all the animals got stuck. I always wanted to go here since I was a kid. It was great and a real stimulation to the imagination The pond really does bubble. Never trust a bubbling pond. A lesson of history. I could see where some might be disappointed but I loved it!!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mehetabell
40,Great museum to visit in the depths of hollywood,"Amazing how the tar pits have survived and kept fossils around from the ice age. Highlights were mammoth, saber tooth cat, sloth (ice age anyone ?). Some of the tar pits are still active digs and the others still ooze tar and gas bubbles through. The museum does not have a cafe, but there are plenty of places to eat within one block.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/petergharper
50,So interesting and fun,12-year-old granddaughter really enjoyed the museum. Recommend both shows. Beautiful park outside with access to the outdoor exhibits. We spend most of the day here. Admission was very reasonable.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnnieMandM
50,Wow! Very interesting and special museum,We discovered the museum by councidence and were totally overwhelmed by this fascinsting place. Very interesting to see still active tar pits and all the skeletons and bones of mammuts and other mammals. One of our highlights in los angeles.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/groovymone
50,"Unique, Well Done, Don't Miss","Took my smilodon-crazy son to this spot, making him a third generation visitor. This was such a vivid part of my childhood, and I'm pleased to say that each time I visit it gets better. We got to watch paleontologists sort microfossils, my son got to high-five the fossilized foot of a giant sloth, the grounds are laid out for a nice afternoon stroll ... really, if you have a child under the age of 12, I can't recommend this enough.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DoctorKansasBeef
50,What a fun way to learn something new!,"I had heard the name ""La Brea Tar Pits"" but I didn't even really know what they were. However, we stumbled across the museum and decided to go in. What a very cool place. If you are curious and interested in learning, then this is the place for you! The museum is well done, the film worth the extra $4.00 to watch, and going outside to explore the active tar pits is just cool. BTW - the first Tuesday of the month is free :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Susan586
50,Great Museum in the middle of Wilshire!,Our kids loved watching the volunteers sorting microfossils. The docents were excellent and full of great facts. It's amazing to see the collection of fossils. Definitely worth the price of admission..which is very reasonable.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Campbls
40,Curious Phenomenon in the Middle of LA,"It is an incongruous site, all the tar bubbles coming to the surface of this viscous, dark ""lake"" in the middle of LA. The fake dinosaurs that pepper the place are a bit creepy, but they do tell a tale, as it were. Definitely on the list of Curious LA landmarks.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/129sylvies
40,Really interesting,We had an enjoyable and interesting morning. It was well worth doing the Excavators Tour as it was informative and entertaining. The Titans of the Ice Age movie is well worth viewing too - my only criticism is that the aircon was turned up so high that sitting in the theatre to view it was like being in the Ice Age!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JanD342
10,"Boring, Boring and more Boring",Even the kids who like fossils and dinosaurs were bored. After visiting not sure why this is a tourist attraction.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/daviddH6000NA
50,Very interesting and unexpected,Not what you expect to find in the middle of a large city but fascinating to walk around. You can self guide or tag on to one of the guided tours with very informative guides. The $12 parking covers the outside area but it is a separate fee for getting into the museum. Some of the pits are still being excavated and beds and small mammals still get stuck in the tar occasionally.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/5cruffy
40,Interesting little museum,"We enjoyed our time here, though it fell slightly short of our expectations. The museum just feels like it needs a big upgrade, with more added to it and a clean up of existing areas. The 3d movie was very good and what fossils are on display were very well presented.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mattr6284
50,It's sticky,Great venue for learning about the ice age environment. Well organized museum with excellent programming. They did a great job of showing the benefits of science in understanding climate change. This is well worth a visit,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/35danem
50,Ice Age Museum!,"Amazing one-of-a-kind museum! How many places can you see an actual tar pit?? Seriously, there's a large tar pit in the grounds and it was fascinating. Of course there were obligatory statues of ice age animals being pulled into the tar pit. Makes for great photos!!The museum is great. It's large with plenty of exhibits about the ice age and how they became fossilized in tar pits. You can easily spend an entire day here. They offer tours as well and you can entire a secret tar pit that they are excavating. See some behind the scenes action! A great museum to visit in LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lydiakoh
50,Dream come true!,"My 12 year old has dreamed of visiting the La Brea Tar Pits since he was just a little guy. What a wonderful informative museum and park!We did the whole thing with the 3-D experience Titans of the Ice Age and the Ice Age Encounters although they were geared towards a little younger crowd. We still enjoyed them and found them to be informative. We went on the excavator tour of the grounds and saw all the Pits and learned that they are actually asphalt and not tar. Overall, it was a quality museum with great information worth what we paid. The park itself was free to wander around in and explore for those who like to save a few dollars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mrelyafi
40,An Interesting Part of Los Angeles,"We don't have anything like this in Australia, so it was very interesting to learn about the history of the tar pits. Both the museum exhibits and the shows were fascinating (especially Ice Age Encounters, with a 'live' sabre-tooth tiger wandering up to us!), and my kids enjoyed trying to pull the metal rods out of the tar (it was very hard!). Walking around outside, it's easy to see how animals could mistakenly walk into the tar pits and not be able to get themselves out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DV226
30,Expected more,"I thought that by now they would have expanded the exhibits and made the pits themselves more accessible, not the case. You don't get to see an actual ""dig"" even though it is right there behind the fence.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/derekd12
50,Oh FUN!!!!!,"Cross Wilshire Blvd at Curson, smell the methane gases oozing from the underworld, and then enter the world of the tar pits with its mastodons awaiting you and its vast fossil collection. LA is built on vast pools of tar/methane (see what's going onm for example, in Playa Vista!) and this fascinating place with its lovely grassy areas and exhibits will show you what it once was.... A fun place to visit with children and all the family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Miriyam
50,Just Awesome!,"So interesting to see this part of the history of LA. Mammoth, saber-tooth tiger, sloth, bison, wolves and so many more fossils to marvel at. And then the bizar sight of oil seeping up through the grass! Very cool!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peterhZ9440GU
40,A must see for your visit.,"The story behind the tar pits is a good one, and looking at the tar lake lets your mind imagine the situation long ago. The museum is interesting as well. The only reason I gave it four stars is I wanted there to be MORE. My expectation was different than the reality. Nonetheless, it is worth the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Seacreature1
50,Something Different To Do In Los Angels,"This is a very different thing to do while in LA. Not on ever ones tour of LA to see but it isWorth seeig. It is a well done reminder of the long ago past of what LA was like. Displays are well done, seeing the bubbling tar knowing what happen to those animals and maybe a few people got too close to, opens your mind to our long ago past. Something there for all age groups. Parking can be hard, but where in LA is it easy. Just watch were you walk as the tar can pop up anywhere. No kidding.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jrm51153
40,Museum is fantastic tar pits a bit of a let down,The museum was worth the whole trip. I have wanted to go for years and finally got the chance. The displays were well thought out and it was neat watching them clean the bones. Unfortunately most of the tar pits have dried up and we missed the timing of the dig in the current excavation. It is near other museums so that is a plus too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/980kristinap
50,Fun visit for dinosaur fans,I've walked by this place many times but finally did the museum. It was great. We were approached by a knowledgeable docent on several occasions. It's fun for the kids and grown-ups. Plus the walk outside is great as you get to see what excavations are currently underway.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Barbara572013
50,Tar pits!!!! Dinosaurs!,Great place for history and nice walk around park and inside museum. I get general admission and recommend it gives you access to everything except films inside museum but if u like history films u can go with that added to general admission. Be carful around grass areas tar spots are marked with cones so don't bring nice shoes just incase. Smell is well tar! But it is outdoors so unless u have very sensitive nose you are a ok 👌!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/katastraphy7
50,So Interesting!,"I have been fascinated with this place since I was a kid. Visiting the tar pits in person was really great. You can go and roam the grounds without paying. You can see excavations, old tar pits and new ones just oozing up. They put construction cones on these, but watch your step - there could be more! For a very small fee you can go in to the museum and see the bones removed from the pits and learn all about them. There is a movie to watch also, but we didn't do that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kryptogram
40,Must see!,"Of all if the places in L.A. to see, you have to stop here. Everyone has heard of it! Parking is awful, give it up and park underground for $14. We caught the levitating rock which is right there and then went to see the tar pits. Most of the exhibits you can see for free which is what we did, but you do have to pay for the museum. It was cool, as expected, and it was fun to see the current dig.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mdgipsy
50,musuem weekend,"a great addon experience to the LACMA right next door.The price $8 (senior) a little small but very interesting. Bring the kids, and a picnic lunch for the beautiful park out front",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gallaghera416
30,Fun but a little boring....,"Other than the main pit and where they are excavating, the rest of them are just not much to see. The information on each is somewhat interesting, but you can also get that in the museum. The skeletons and fossils inside are somewhat interesting, but it's a pretty quick trip through. Good for young kids and those interested in dinosaurs, otherwise, didn't find it that interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mmbastin
30,Interesting for Science Buffs,Our tour guide took us to the La Brea Tar Pits. It is an attraction that was interest for about ten minutes but we stayed an hour. I know everyone has heard of the Tar Pits and why they are famous. I would suggest dropping by for about ten minutes and reading the signs.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VA-Short-Term
50,Mammoth skeletons!,"What a cool place to visit! The tar pits are right outside the museum, and it's so incredible that they're there, right in the center of LA. The museum itself is amazing, with hundreds of skeletons on display, all taken right from the tar pits. The museum does a good job with descriptions and images of the animals that the skeletons are from. It's also really cool to see the work that continues even today on the tar pits, both inside and outside the museum. This museum is right next door to LACMA so it's easy to combine trips.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bigred86j
40,Relaxing and interesting,"This is a neat site to spend a few hours exploring. We didn't go into the museum, but enjoyed walking around the grounds and exploring the tar pit displays. It was great to check out an active excavation that was ongoing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tnvol93
50,Surprisingly more interesting than I imagined,"I've wanted to see the La Brea Tar Pits since I first heard about them as a child. (I know, weird item to have on a bucket list.) My family vacationed in LA several times when I was younger, but my suggestion of the Tar Pit for a day trip never made the cut.So this time, I was the adult in charge of the vacation. We had time on our last day in LA, and so I finally got to visit the tar pits. Found out they're actually asphalt pits!The grounds are laid out very nicely and there's a lot to see and do - if this type of thing interests you. I found it all fascinated, and I think it drove my husband nuts that I insisted on reading every single sign and learning as much as I could. My favorite parts were definitely the viewing areas where you could see down into the pits. Second favorite was seeing the asphalt/tar come bubbling up out of the ground at random locations that were cordoned off by some fencing. My least favorite was watching the people sort through dirt. No different than watching the grass grown.One of the nice things about the La Brea Tar Pits is that they are located right next door to LACMA (Los Angeles County Museum of Art). My daughters weren't interested in the tar pits, and chose to go to LACMA instead and really enjoyed the museum. I think visiting the two in the same day would make for a great, full day. If the weather is nice, you can eat outside in the shared park area. (upwind from the tar pits, of course!)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OhioMomof3
50,sticky stuff,La Brea Tar Pitts and Museum is the single most important museum to visit in Los Angeles. You will be amazed at the wealth of natural history that has and still being uncovered.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sungr8t
50,day trip from Orange County,"Great place. We took two teenagers and they managed to put the phones down for a while and look at the amazing things around the pits and museum. We got the package with the guided tour(45 mins), Ice Age 3D 30 minute movie, and a mini show with the sabre tooth tiger(15 mins). Kids enjoyed the random tar oozing up on the lawn in various places. We all learned a lot and had a good time. Good restaurants very close too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andy192016
50,Fabulous Family Experience,"While known by some, I consider the La Brea Tar Pits and Museum a hidden gem for many LA visitors. The museum is both fun and educational for the entire family.There is a 3D movie to explain its history and indoor/outdoor tours to show you the grounds and exhibits. Every family visiting southern California should visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TroyB69
50,What a gem,"I've heard about this attraction but did not realize it was this large and that it has indoor and outdoor features. Also, two other museums are next door. Be prepared to share with bus loads of students.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Paul-A-C-62
50,Amazing Site,"The ice age came to life for us! We loved seeing all the skulls & bones inside the museum, and walking around the tar pits. Scientists were working in the lab the day we went - sifting through dirt to find tiny bones.We did the walking tour, which includes a stop inside the original excavation site. You can't do this on your own - must be escorted.Only issue is there is a lot of litter and trash inside the fences. Would think they'd take better care of one of the top attractions in L.A. But we're definitely glad we went.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NotALostWanderer
50,Such a freakin' cool place to visit in LA - get your nerd on,"No question this place is dated and needs a facelift! Having said that it is still be excavated (and you can see an actual excavation when you go), the fossil finds are amazing and well-displayed, and it's a great place for kids, families and nerds of all ages. C'mon guys - raise some money and get this place in the 21st century!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/erikkieser
50,Unique museum with active research you can watch!,"This is one of the coolest museums I have ever visited. On my second and most recent visit I just paid for parking and spent time walking around the grounds, viewing the active tar pits which are bubbling all over the grounds, and one pit which is being excavated. There are very nice placards that describe the pits, the history of animals in the region, and how scientists are going about exploring the contents. The grounds are also nicely manicured and enjoyable as a park on its own right. This is a great family outing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zdufran
50,Great to Finally Visit,"After reading about this place for years, it was a thrill to finally get to visit. We were able to go on a guided tour, which enhanced the experience. We loved the fact that this was still a working excavation site. we were able to see the scientists in action. We also enjoyed the exhibits in the museum and have come away with a better understanding of the last 50,000 years in California.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jameshflora
50,Great just to walk around,You don't have to go into the museum here as there is plenty to see walking around the tar pits outside.Great display and you can see active excavation pits and exposed fossils from the tar pits.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rwe003
50,Mastadons and Ancient Camels and Sabertooth Tigers in Downtown Los Angeles! For REAL !,"WOW !! Imagine living in one of the most densely populated and modern cities in the world, and finding, right in the middle of it, active ""tar pits"" from which the bones/skeletons of mastadons, saber tooth tigers, and even ancient camels were trapped thousands of years ago...and are NOW being excavated, right in the middle of the city. That's the La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles. You can't miss this. It's unbelievable, but true. Come and see these reconstructed skeletons and active research and still bubbling tar pits. Great place for kids to be impressed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/350ra
40,Kids loved it,I have wanted to visit here ever since I saw My Girl. So this spring break I brought my kids to see it. They offer free admission for military so that is nice. Still pay for kids but that's not bad. All of the outside part of the park is free. Which is the tar pits and the statues of the animals stuck. The museum is pretty cool too. Shows all of the animals from the area that they have found in the pits and such. It was a very neat little museum to take my children to see. They enjoyed it a lot!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kelleyj812
40,"Very interesting, but a little run down and expensive","The tar pits are free to walk around and there is a very small museum that you have to pay to get in. The tickets seem overpriced. If you decide to go, it will be a quick visit unless they are actively digging.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/campbellc44
50,La Brea Outing,"Always wanted to go see the ""Tar Pits"" but never got to it until now. Definitely not what I was expecting or what I perceived. The grounds were amazing and the museum was very interesting. Lots of very cool stuff to see. Learned a lot about the local history and the asphalt seeps. Also amazed at the amount of fossils that have been found and those that still haven't.A great location as well to take a picnic lunch, but go to the west side of the park away from the lake as the methane bubbles do give it an aroma.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/59stann
40,Pretty Amazing Scene in the centre of the city.,"If you're interested in fossils and ice-age animals this is the place to go. It is free to walk around and view the tar pits and you pay an entry fee to the Museum. There are easy walking paths all around the tar pits area and the Museum is really interesting with great displays, skeletons and photographs. The food areas were packed and we waited for ages to get our order which was very ordinary. Would definitely consider taking a sandwich next time.The Museum of Contemporary Art is in the same complex. If you love art it would be great but not really our thing. Taxis are available just outside the gate on Le Brea.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/path893
50,Urban Paleontology,"Yes, the tar pits are an active dig! This is like a natural history musuem, but it is unique in the sense that all of the artifacts have been pulled out of the local area and some have been pulled even this year! It was amazing to see an active dig in the middle of a major metropolitan area. I could even recognize one of the scientists actively working behind the glass as one of the scientists pictured elsewhere in a different exhibit.Pictured is the bottom of dig site 91. I promise it is cooler in real life.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/461nickr
30,Interesting,"This was on my list for a visit mostly because of My Girl 2. It was really interesting to find out how they discovered the pits, but also really sad knowing how many animals got caught in them and died. Worth the history lesson!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brittanyzz
50,Truly fascinating,You study about this place in school but it is really hard to picture it until after you have seen it.Fossils are something to see but the fact that it is still bubbling right now in the middle of LA is amazing.It's worth two hours and high on the list for educational visits for kids and family.The museum is always alive and working. The paleontologists are really there and on view. There are still thousands of bones still buried right here.Definitely worth a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RBB7
50,California road trip,"If you have any interest in fossils and dinosaurs this is the perfect place for you to visit. The La Brea Tar Pits is an active dig sit for fossils, you can see the work in progress at every stage. Also the stories told in the museum about the different periods of time were educational.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dianemB1463NC
50,Called the George Page Museum as well.,"Have been there many times, one of my favorite venues. Fascinating place to visit. Walk outside on a path to see how the tar captured the mammals, make sure to see the show! Great for kids and adults as well. We always take visiting friends and family there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vickiwinthrop
40,Good Stop along the HOP ON/HOP OFF Bus,"My wife and I recently visited LA and we had a couple of days to tour. We took the ""HOP ON HOP OFF "" bus. Our favorite ""hop off"" spot was the La Brea Tar Pits. It is right next to the LA County Art Museum (LACAM). The tar pits help us to understand what happened to pre historic animals in the area. Most of the stop is a free outside walk around area. There is also an inside museum. This is about 1 hour to 90 minute stop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/159GaryS
40,attraction review,"Interesting, educational museum that is not well known.Kids will enjoy the displays. The grounds are very attractive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/evansj862
40,Really interesting attraction,"Our visit here was very informative and really good to do as a different experience to the mainstream tourist attractions. You can see the natural tar pits around the grounds and the museum shows the history of the tar pits and remains of animals that have been found in them over time. There's also the added novelty of it being one of the settings of the movie Volcano (1997). Make sure to wear sun-block, bring drinking water, a water-spraying fan of some kind and to try to cover your head in the sun as the heat can get intense walking around outside.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DarD92
40,Interesting!,"The first thing you notice when entering the grounds is the smell from the open tar pits but it is worth visiting especially when you see the family of animals in the big lake, makes you wonder what life must have been like so far back in the past.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mald03ives
50,Unexpected gem in this urban jungle,"Just where you'd least expect it, prehistoric remains in tar pits in the middle of Los Angeles. A great stop while in LA and free to low cost. if you want!Parking south of the park costs a buck an hour on the street and there are food trucks on Wilshire at noon time. Besides the main lake, pit 91 and now 23 are worth the visit if you can't afford the museum. Lots to wander and explore and great people watching, too.Make time for it, especially with kids!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chicagonative_7
40,A Snapshot in Time,"Very hard to recreate a period millions of years ago. The outside display of the Tar Pits is impressive, though rubbish in the area is a shame. The open parkland looked nice for those who had time to enjoy. The museum has successfully created a very good education medium. Not a large display but very informative. The La Brea Tar Pits have been a place I have always wanted to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TPTravellers
50,Better than expected,"This was chosen by my 11 year old. He had been bugging me for a year to go to LA and specifically the tar pits. Since we live in Florida, this is no small request. When we decided to go to California for Spring Break I knew we would have to go here.We got there early so we could get parking in the lot ($12 cash-which seems to be the going rate in LA). It was nice to be there early as later on school groups inundated the place. My son was in heaven and I enjoyed it much more than I expected. The museum isn't huge, which is a plus in my book. Just enough to be interesting, not enough to be overwhelming. The museum and the short video can be done in about 60-90 minutes. Walking around the park to see the outside pits takes about another 30 minutes. It's a beautiful park, but the stench near the pits can be nauseating.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mabg68
40,Fun and Educational,"La Brea Tar Pits were not exactly what I had envisioned, but it was still fun. We first visited the tar pits outside, but there isn't a lot to see there. We saw some people working which was interesting. The outside is free to visit.We weren't planning on going inside, but we ended up being able to get a combination ticket for the Tar Pits Museum and the Natural History Museum where we were planning on going anyway.I was really impressed with the displays in the museum. There are a number of displays and things to read from mammoth skeletons to hundreds of dire wolf skulls.The tar pits are also in a large grassy area. There are trees, plants, and flowers (all of which are prehistoric). It's such a beautiful area set in the middle of such a large city. It's fun to imagine the dinosaurs and prehistoric animals that existed there before our time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stefee818
40,Pretty cool,"This was a pretty cool, low key family outing. My kids are 15 and 20 and we had a good time going to see the pits and the museum. It wasn't somewhere you can spend a lot of time, but it was fun and not terribly crowded. After the pits we went to dinner and shopping at the Grove, a nearby beautiful outdoor shopping center and farmer's market.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Acb8694
50,Expand your Knowledge and Enjoy the Ambiance Inside and Out at the La Brea Tar Pits,"I had not been to the La Brea Tar Pits in over 30 years and looked forward to this free day to explore the Hancock Park site once again. Added incentive was the free admission for teachers! The Page Museum offers interesting exhibits, movies, hands on opportunities perfect for all ages. I did not see any of the videos, but did take advantage of the free group tour. Our guide, Hannah, was knowledgable and personable. She kept us all engaged, including the young children who joined out group of about 20. We spent our time discussing the on site research, watching the palentologists working right in front of us. Then we went out to roam the beautiful grounds, stopping first at the""lake"" of asphalt that made the site famous. There are nearly 100 excavation sites on the grounds in various stages of study.The grassy, hilly grounds are open to the public. It looked like many locals were enjoying the grass and trees at lunch time. Several food trucks parked across Wilshire for hungry customers.Seeing all the recovered fossils and learning about discoveries was fascinating. I recommend watching the ""Ice Age"" animated movies before you go, especially if you are bringing kids with you.The LA Museum of Art is next door. Other museums dot this section of Wilshire, too. Museum buffs, don't miss this area of LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/225jenifere
40,Interesting but not much to see,$12 to park but grounds are without fee. Interesting to see pits. Disappointed to find excavator tours were not available until 1 PM. Really like being able to see someone actually working on cataloging fossils.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/254ericah
50,Kids loved it!,I took my grandkids for a visit to the La Brea Tar Pits and Museum. The admission was very reasonable. I also purchased movie tickets for a movie about the tar pits. My grandkids really loved the museum. We spent quite a bit of time there. We also walked around the outdoor pit area. The whole experience was very educational and exciting. I enjoyed the trip too!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/db_blazer
40,La Brea Tar Pits,"This is my fourth visit to Los Angeles in eight years and I have wandered past numerous times but had never gone in, so glad we finally did.My 6-year old daughter absolutely loved it, she enjoyed the interactive displays, animatronic and the fossils on display.Plenty to see and do both in and outside.Parking was $12, we arrived shortly after it opened but noticed it did get really busy a couple hours after that and the carpark can get congested at times.We left the car there and walked around the nearby Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA), could have also walked to the Farmers Market and/or The Grove (parking around there was horrible on a Saturday!)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nicbloxnz
50,Wanted to go for years---glad I did,Very interesting for anyone of any age. Very well done. Good film to see. Lovely part of museums of LA grounds.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mmoly
50,Spring Road Trip,"A visit to this attraction is a must if you are on Wilshire Blvd. This street has several museums and attractions within an easy walk of each other. We parked at the car museum for the day. But back to the 'Pits'. Imagine pre-history in the middle of bustling LA, that's what you will find here. There is no admission fee to the beautiful grounds. The most impressive pit is located near the entrance, with many more smaller ones scattered throughout the grounds. There are also some active dig sites to look at. You can spend a few hours looking or just relaxing and enjoying the day. There is also a museum on the grounds which we did not go into because we were short on time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/saleafpeepers
50,Glad we visited!,"It is a very interesting museum. Amazing to see what has been recovered from the area and to realise that they are still finding new fossils. There some very large exhibits like the mammoths and some very small ones like a field mouse. Although you can see the tar pits for free, the museum is well worth the money. It is not very expensive at all. Something you can do with kids of all ages in less than two hours, longer if you're watching the movie. Highly recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ljr2612
40,Great place,First let me start out by saying you don't have to pay to see the tar pits. I was not aware of this since I'm new to California and this was a spur of the moment visit. We did see the museum. It provided a lot of insight on animals that were here in California besides dinosaurs. The picture book was pretty cool.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luvtravel06
50,Paleontology - in the middle of Los Angeles!,"Amazing to find a tar pit in the middle of a major metropolitan area, check it out - good for older kids and families who are into this kind of stuff. Detailed documentation about the on-going studies of the animals recovered from this ancient site and a nice book store.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wendor818
30,Interesting spot but fumes can make you nauseous,We are actually going to the LACMA and realized the La Brea pits were right next door so we had to see. The fumes were very strong that day and my husband got a bit nauseous from them. Then we read about the history of the tar pits online!!! Its a must read that Hollywood sits on top of an active oil field!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrsBad305
50,"If you have any interest, go",I've heard about the tar pits for years and was so happy I went with my kids. You can visit the pits for free and they're mind boggling. But don't miss the museum for a reasonable fee.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Didre
40,kids loved it,our 4 year old loved this place. The tar pits were really interesting. I would say you could skip the museum and save a bit of money there wasn't much in there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pet87a
50,"Neat little museum, fascinating tar pits","We loved the museum, it has some interactive displays such as trying to pull something out of tar to see what it feels like. There are hundreds if not thousands of fossils on display, each with explanations of what it was and other information such as how long ago it lived, when that animal fell in, what they were like, etc. We also paid a little extra (in total I think it ws 16USD each) to see the short film which gave insight into why there are so many fossils in the tar pits and what the history of the tar pits is. The tar pits themselves are seperate to the museum and are free, they are well wroth a wander. you can even see their current projects there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JordanR2166
30,Short & sweet,This was a great place for a school trip. Some of the activities were for younger kids - my son is 12. The location was good - near the Petersen Museum & the Museum of Art.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/daniellemK8361AI
40,Chance to do a museum and till be outside,Tickets include a guided tour of the park during which the guide explains what happened thousands of years ago to the animals that were trapped in the tar pits.The museum has some interesting skeletons and life size models as well as a lovely atrium garden.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tour224332
50,Great place!,"Great place to take the family, great for kids, fun and educational at the same time. Always one of our favorite spots in LA and it is free!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/23brankar
50,great time here,we loved it the park and ground are beautiful and the museum was very educational we recommend to anyone traveling in to the area,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maryrA8629ZN
50,"Great museum, but a bit small inside","Wonderful displays, great introductory movie. Inside displays are not plentiful, but the big draw is the tarpits and excavation sites themselves. This is also on ""museum row"" or something (""Museum Mile?"") and is right next door to LACMA, so you can easily get your fill of museums if you have time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stephaniewoolsey
50,So Cool!,I love seeing quirky places when I travel and La Brea Tar Pits is so unusual. It really is worth seeing the tar pits as well as the museum. The tar pits themselves really look like a fenced in pond with some mammoth statues around it. But the museum is really interesting. Lots of reassembled skeletons and different bones. Fun to watch the scientists working too!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eluper
40,Neat history and great museum,"What you don't think about in LA is that the place once the home of many interesting creatures before all the people moved there. Mammoths and Sabre Tooth Tigers used to inhabit the place. And over time, they would occasionally fall into the tar pits where they would be perfectly preserved. Go see the museum as it brings to life a part of the LA basin history that is very fascinating.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traveloften028
30,kind of interesting,had gone to LACMA and didnt realize the tar pits were here so walked around. it was interesting to see it but hard to really see tons of oil coming up. the large pit opening was closed at the time. but its interesting to read the captions. wouldnt make a special trip but doing it with LACMA is great.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sport5travel
40,Travel Back in Time!,"The tar pits give you an opportunity to experience the geology of the area the way it looked thousands of years ago. The pits are located next door to the LACMA, so the location is convenient for a great day trip. Take the time to visit the museum and check our the exhibits; we met a wonderful docent, Jane, who spent time explaining how the fossils were found and treated so they could be displayed. Also, walk to the area where the scientists are at work cleaning fossils that are still being found. A true working museum!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/952lindag
40,Stopped By During Tour,A friend took us here during a recent tour of the area. I had heard about the tar pits many years ago. I did not know the history of the pits until we visited. The visit was very informative and it was very interesting to see the pits in the middle of the city.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CDEW
40,Unique,"Located in the heart of metropolitan Los Angeles, The La Brea Tar Pits are an Ice Age excavation site & a famous fossil locality. We joined the excavator tour – very enlightening. Interesting and well done fossil exhibits include mammoths, sloths, saber-toothed cats, camels, condors, and more. Check-out the La Brea Tar Pits where tar is still bubbling up through the ground. Absolutely amazing if you have any interest in paleontology.Admission is $12 (adult) with reduced admission for students, seniors & children.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/denver60
40,Interesting trip back in time,My wife and I did a day trip from Vegas to LA. We decided to visit LACMA and saw the La Brea Tar Pits and decided to do that. To me there isn't much to see other than tar coming up from the ground. Use your imagination and step back in time and you will have fun. The exhibits are interesting and the fossils are as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1030victord
30,Interesting,It was interesting but really I was expecting more than just the one large outdoor tar pit. I was disappointed to see that the bubbling you see are all man made and on timers. It was ok but thats about all.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/erawson77
30,Okay,"This is a cool museum although I drove through 1-1/2 hours of LA traffic to reach it. The movie which is $4 extra is just okay - I'd skip it. I was able to hop on the Excavator Tour which provided more information about the tar pits. I would definitely recommend hitting that up if you have time. Overall, expensive and just okay. You can walk around the outside and view the Tarpits themselves without paying admission to the indoor section. There are food trucks across the street which provide an easy option for lunch though the wait can be longer with crowds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SunDaisy11
40,Family daytime activity,"Eight of us toured the museum, saw a film and strolled the grounds. Lots of interesting exhibits for adults and children. Especially enjoyed the reassembled bones and the fishbowl. Sorry there was no dig active at the time of our visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/3Eagles
40,I just visited the tar pits,The tar pits are in need of a deep cleaning. There is a lot of garbage floating around in the tar. It is also difficult to photograph as the bars on the fence surrounding the pits are close together.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chelslynne
40,Great for kids to burn off steam!,"This is a small museum that was super interesting located in the middle of a park. It was great for letting my kid run around and roll down the grassy hill. The museum was small but they had a great area where you could see people doing the fossil recovery, really interesting.We were lucky to find there were four food trucks parked across the street where we could pick up lunch, walk over and eat at the park!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CV1013
50,Fascinating,"I found the Tar Pits fascinating. If you have any interest in geology, archeology, paleontology, or the Flintstones, don't miss this. Absolutely unique. There is tar bubbling up through the ground. Huh? I don't get it. And this is in the middle of LA. Go figure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cheryl90
50,Really interesting!,It was really interesting to find out about the Tar Pits. Not something I'd heard of. So strange yet very interesting. I'd definitely go again and recommend a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lisatI739ES
40,enjoyed,"I love art and culture so this was a great place to see both, loved every minute of it, would see it again",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rblossoming15
50,Very well put together,Very interesting and entertaining. It is very easy to navigate. Also good info and we got to see some of the people doing the actual digging for fossils.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/891gabriele
40,Very Cool but Expensive,"We went here with our LA Let's Go passes, so we didn't pay the $19 admission fee each. We spend about 45 minutes here with our 11-year old and loved it, so I am torn about the relatively high price, especially once you factor in parking as well (TIP: park at the little shopping area right up the block past the museum and you can validate an hour of parking by buying a burrito or a coffee INSTEAD of paying $12 at museum). The outdoor tar pit viewing area is free, but inside are the very neat sets of fossils (probably 10-12 large sets) as well as some other minor displays.One disappointment is they have coin machines to make a commemorative coin but they require change to pay, and the gift shop refused to make chain for us. Pretty poor customer service.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/usflyer
20,2 hours tops,Not worth the hype. Quite disappointing. You'll be through the museum section in 30 minutes and all the tours were in the afternoon.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Benhassan
50,Unique Natural History Museum,"Unlike your typical natural history museum, this one is dedicated to the megafauna that once resided in Los Angeles and North America during the ice ages.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fabiana479
50,Been here 5 times and can't wait to go back!,"So much to see and learn! The exhibits are stunning! So awesome to learn about our natural history right here in LA. The Mammoths are incredible as are the Dire wolves. I particularly love learning about the Sloth Bears and how they had armor plating - WHAT?!?!?! So cool!A cute little arboretum inside and the fascinating tar pits outside top off this amazing place. No matter how many times I've gone here, I still can't see, learn and experience everything here.Highly recommended for any group, or any age person!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobinSPH
30,Interesting for a couple of hours tops,"Really interesting facts within. Only really a brief visit venue. Could do with a cafe. Staff helpful and knowledgeable. The pits around the grounds add a little, but don't expect too much.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MJCHertfordshire_uk
50,Visit with the Grand Children,This is a must with younger people. They really enjoy all the various activities especially Noah's Ark,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/conradb989
50,"Right in downtown LA, not to be missed","Don't go on a hot summer day, you'll swelter. All of the pits are bubbling and the tours are outside. Inside the museum are fantastic exhibits for all ages and you can watch the scientists at work, even watch them as they reach down into the tar and clean off items. It's a gem.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CynthiaC1964
30,La Brea Tar Pits,"My first attempt to visit did not work out because of parking. I arrived about 4:45 pm and the gate to the parking lot was closed. I returned the next day at 2:pm and this time there was an attendant at the gate. She told me the lot was full and that I could park in a lot across the street. It ended up costing me $16 to park for a few hours. After parking and entering the site I noticed numerous parking spots available, so I'm not sure why their lot was closed.The tar pit is an interesting site. You can see the bubbles coming up through the murky liquid asphalt. There are some Mammoth recreations in the muck. There are a couple of pits that are active dig sites, but you can't get too close or see much really.Inside the museum there are a few different options. The more you pay, the more access you get. I paid $16 to walk around the museum and see the presentation. While the displays are fairly well done and kind of interesting, I found the 3D movie rather boring.I was always more interested in Dinosaurs though. Mammoths, Mastodons, etc just aren't as interesting to me. There are some cool displays though. There's a wall containing over 400 wolf skulls that have been excavated from the pits.Overall the site is worth walking around and checking out, but you're not missing much if you pass on the 3D movie IMO.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/176dougg
40,interesting facts.. I thoughtn it was tar but really asphalt!!!,facts like.... I just thought animals fall in and maybe drown but seems they just step in and get stuck and die. way gool for kids and adults,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/creekmo1
40,Tar-rific :),sorry for the title had toas a history and science nut I loved seeing all the fossils and then exploring the tar pits outside,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ledbytheunknown
40,A bit old-fashioned - definitely worth a visit,"I've heard about the tar pits my whole life, so we made a point of visiting during our recent trip to LA. The pits themselves look like dark water with constant bubbles, which is kind of spooky. It had rained the morning we arrived, and even the water in the sidewalk cracks was bubbling, which shows that the methane is coming up all around the pits themselves. The museum is interesting, although the animatronic saber-toothed cat attacking a giant ground sloth looks a tad moth-eaten. The tar pull exhibit really illustrates how sticky the tar can be. There is a working lab in the museum where you can watch scientists and trained volunteers clean fossils that researchers continue to discover in the pits. Highly recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PL28401
40,Fascinating,"It's free to get in and walk the grounds. Parking is not free though. We didn't have time for the museum but it was cool to walk the grounds. It's a fascinating place.Be sure to visit the ""sage garden"" for some interesting smells. Come by 2PM to have enough time to see the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DarrenHumphrey
50,Natural and educating site,"Was a wonderful natural site to visit, not man-made, and was most educational and interesting for the grandchildren.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cschiller2016
50,NICE DAY TRIP AT THE MUSEUM,"Exciting things to see & do, best liked was the tour, narrated by one of the employees. I disliked they close too early & extra fee for parking. Museum is very nice with lots info including onsite paleontologists work on Ice Age fossils. The atrium is small & contains plants, waterfall & small Koi fish pond. Bring camera to capture wonderful memories. Titans of the Ice Age 3D was great too. We still had sunlight & walked along the Miracle Mile and enjoyed dinner at one of the restaurants. Highly recommend as a great family day trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eph2004
50,Everyone needs to see this,"It seems few know this place even exists. You are able to see actual archaeological digs as they happen, as well as scientists cleaning the finds. So many prehistoric animals caught in the tar allows ongoing research. A must do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelgalAvon
40,"Neat museum, not exactly what I expected.",The museum is very neat with lots of the artifacts from the tar pits. The actual area around the tar pits was not as exciting as I thought. There are some random areas where the tar comes out and you can watch them work on pulling fossils out of the tar.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/richardandkristy2012
50,love it here,"we enjoyed ourselves but we couldnt find the parking for the site, we ended up parking around the block and paid like $3 for every 15mins",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/43briw
40,Very interesting Site to See,Perhaps not on the top of the list of activities to do in LA - but we did this find the La Brea Pits to be interesting. We visited on a rainy day. 2 Hour visit is sufficient at this site.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chefmf
50,Nature at its primeval best,The tar pits are located around the park but the most extensive and impressive ones are next door to the LA Museum of Art. It is impressive that tar that erupts from beneath has been used over centuries for caulking canoes to curing certain medical problems. Moreover the original crude oil explorers use to look for these tar pits in order to find the black gold. So if you are interested in seeing a cousin of the gasoline used to power a car's engine then this is it. The museum and gift shop are worth a visit but beware that you will probably leave a bit poorer especially if you have inquisitive children.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H5458EUbrianm
30,Don't go swimming here.,Fun for little kids or folks. This was done in June of ((1954 not 2016)). I was just a kid but remember it like yesterday when I was 9 years old. First thing I saw when school was out for the summer. You don't have to be a kid for grownups will like it also. This could be a history lesson for there wasn't anything around when it first began. Can't believe it was right in the heart of Los Angeles. The pits were good to look at but don't forget that the Museum can tell you so much too. Half a day maybe for it would still leave you time for other things. Today I guess I would rate it a 3-star but back then maybe a 4 or even a 5. You have to spend a couple of weeks while touring southern California so why not include this as something different. All will like it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jaduckcoin
50,Wonderful museum,The tar pits are real and the museum is exceptional in its presentation of ice age mammals. We particularly enjoyed a 3D movie about the last ice age and how the mammals became trapped. Guides kept popping up to have a touch of real fossils and explanations. A great space with a unique story. Highly recommended,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emorga
40,Interesting view of history,Nice place to visit while in LA. The uniqueness alone of the tar pit is worth a stop . Take a few minutes here even if you don't do the museum.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rightfoot
40,"Wow, it was great, and not just for kids.","The La Brea Tar Pits and Museum combine a museum about the fossils recovered from the Tar Pits and how they got there with the opportunity to visit some of the pits that were previously excavated with one pit that is still being excavated.The museum has wonderful fossils, and a trove of bones, skulls, bird eggs and even insects found in the Tar Pits. It would seem to be a wonderful place for children who were all taking it in and, from the smiles and laughs, loving it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R9894VRmartinm
40,Outdoor park is an active fossil dig! Parking is $12,"We didn't go inside the museum, but instead visited the area where they are actively searching for fossils. You can see the dig in the summer. The park outside is enough for non-enthusiastic kids, public bathrooms in the park in front of the museum were adequate.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/754briang
50,Lots of fossils to see,"We visited during very bad weather, so we ran right past the tar pits and into the museum. It was nice inside, the staff was friendly and happy to answer questions. Lots of interesting exhibits, a small gift shop and a 3D movie theater. Bonus: great location for catching Pokemon!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D7819HEkellyb
50,Wonderful Tourist Destination,"A combined visit to the Tar Pits & Museum have been a perrenial favorite, educational, low-cost and family-friendly destination for many years. It continues to inspire and fascinate kids and adults to read about and explore the physical sciences. The nearby L.A. County Art Museum ( and it's cafeteria) are also available and present a ""twofer"" in the Mid-Wilshire L.A. area because of their close proximity as great places of interest for singles, couples and families not to be missed when you visit L.A.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rafiSoCal
40,A must see,If you are in LA you must see this exhibit. It has been around for years but the history involved is just incredible. They bring history to life.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CaribbeanFan79
30,Tar pits,"If your into everything dinosaur then a great place to visit for an hour or so, close to La so easy to get to.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JodyR720
40,Amazing pit in the middle of LA,Took my students here to see the live pit in the middle of LA. We parked across the street and walked over. It was crazy the see on the corner adjacent to the center the tar was actually coming up through the splits in the asphalt. The kids loved seeing the mammoth recreations in the tar pit. Was a fun and beautiful day to walk around the grounds and check out all of the pits and get to see people at work in the back of the center going through artifacts. Great experience for my students who are studying archeology.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/320briannab
50,An Oldie But Goodie!,"This is a fascinating place for the paleontologist in all of us! Amazing to learn that 20,000+ years ago saber tooth tigers and wooly mammoths wandered Los Angeles. Although the pits have been open to the public for decades, it is still an active excavation site where fossils continue to be discovered.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LadyDiButterfli
50,Historical importance,The tar pits and mueseum were great day out in LA activity. Lots to see in park area before going into the mueseum. The mueseum was full of interesting displays with plenty of information. Not a full day activity but if you have young children could be good time waster with the 3D theatre and puppet show.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JulietL164
50,Interesting and Educational,"I had only a basic understanding of the tar pits and no idea what to expect - and I was delighted by my experience. First, this is a scientific center - a true museum and research location. Second, the collection of fossils is incredible. Third, I truly didn't understand how the tar pits were created, how the bones were preserved or how the who thing worked - and it was fascinating to learn.The museum was the most interesting part. The exterior tar pits were interesting to see, especially the dig site, but most of the wonder and knowledge is in the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrianT787
50,Great to go with kids,"The La Brea Tar Pit Museum is a great place to go because it is both visually enticing and interesting. It's quite amazing to have a place that is unearthing fossils of the last ice age in the middle of the city! ( you can see actually see scientists cleaning tar fossils)We went there in the end of the morning.Since there is much to see and explore our 8 years old didn't get tired and ou 12 years old was motivated to follow the exposition in the museum.We also saw one of the movie presentations that both use 2D and 3D. It was ok (not great).Additionally the garden and different Pits allow a great outside walk in the park ( especially in a sunny not so cold winter day).We spent around 2h, and although the Lacma is on the other side of the tar pits, we didn't follow on (it would have been too much).The kids loved it, we loved it.We definitely recommend it!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nicolasw199
50,The most amazing part is Free!,"Most of the actual tar pits are part of the outdoor park and it has no entry fee. The museum and tour is a nice addition, but optional Seeing tar (actually it is asphalt) bubbling out of the ground is pretty amazing, and worth dropping by for. Highly recommended!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/865jerryh
50,An in depth experience at one of LA's more unusual attractions,"There's a nice park wandering around the various tar pits and a great museum with many exhibits, skeletons, dioramas and a movie explaining what has come out of the tar pits over the years. There is also a glass enclosed lab where you can watch the scientists extract and clean bones that have come up to the surface.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dontSeattle
40,A true piece of living history!,Always wanted to go and am glad time has finally allowed a great adventure. The bubbling sight and sound is right in front of you! Glad it is protected with gates so that future visitors can also give all five of their senses a treat of the past!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SLAP_11
50,Good for all ages,"Had been there before with spouse, but had out of town guests, so took them and saw it again. Worth my while. Fascinating; well presented; good for all ages. Very educational and entertaining. Took 45 minute tour and saw 30 minute movie, as well as viewed exhibits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HMS59
40,"Worth visiting,very interesting!",We really enjoyed our visit to the La Brea Tar Pits-an Ice Age fossil excavation site.The excavated fossils are on display in the museum inside and there is a park outside with tar pits and the pleistocene garden .You must interact with the exhibits and read all the information at each exhibit to fully enjoy your visit.It's fascinating information and very worthwhile visiting.Both adults and children will enjoy this visit.It can be as long as you wish to spend in both indoors and outdoors.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/airmount
40,On Tour in Tar.,Had heard of these from a Strangler's song and had always wanted to visit. Very interesting seeing how the pits are excavated and what animals are preserved.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrianC407
30,Saddened by being bored at what could have been awesome,"I found this place boring. We walked around outside (the best part of the visit really), and looked at some fenced off areas. There were a few signs to read, and some interesting tar smells. Inside the museum, there were a few displays and a few more signs to read. We got through it all in an hour or less. I'm not sure how it could improve, but it needs something more. We didn't go to the movie thing they had there - maybe that was the gem it was missing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JineteNZ
30,Meh the Tar/Yay the museum,I live 2 blocks away. The Tar Pits are just that...just tar. Smelly. The museum...small and fun for the family. Tickets are way overpriced though.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LocalLALALocal
50,Unique window into the Ice Age,"Absolutely unique and amazing place. Evolution and fossils are always fascinating but the fact that here you get to see the actual tar pools where the fossils were actually preserved and found is amazing. I wasn't a big fan of LA (first time I visited) but this place alone made the trip worthwhile. The pits themselves are very cool and the exhibition in the museum is well done. I also went to the 3D movie they offer but it wasn't particularly good, definitely not a must to enjoy the place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/and054
50,Best pits in town,"My ex turned Jehovah's Witness, so yeah, ex and started tugging on my daughter about fundie stuff. I figured, well, the earth can only be less than 7000 years old, huh? Let's go to the best historical record ever found in west LA. You can walk by a saber toothed tiger and a human female skeleton with a hologaphic display that dresses her in native garb as the viewing angle changes. The important part for me was the sign over the display, ""7000 year old woman"". They have a viewing area where they are counting seeds and spores from the annual levels of sediment to see what plants were alive and thriving in the area. They are peering in the scopes in front of big bay windows where my daughter was glued for a long time. outside, you can see their actual digs. Just be careful where you walk because, after all, the tar is still there and bubbling up Jed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RichardfromHB
50,An educational visit for all,"I am always sure to bring out-of-town guests here. It is one on only a very few places like it in the world. I true treasure. One can see and understand quite graphically what occurred in ancient times with the animals. Mammoths and dire wolves, the struggle for water and their very lives as they are sucked down into the sticky, black goo.Many people do not know that excavation digs are ongoing and there are opportunities for people to assist.One MUST go into the Page Museum to see the fossils of the animals they recovered and to see the mammoth reconstructed there. One will also see the scientists cleaning and cataloging the fossils still being retrieved there.Be sure to see the exhibit with the pails of tar and the pulling of paddles to demonstrate the difficulty of moving in the tar.Truly a wonderful experience for all ages.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oma664
50,fantastic piece of living history,"This is a must-see in our opinion. It's amazing to have such a place in the midst of all the hustle & bustle of LA. I remember reading about the tar pits way back in school (many, many moons ago) & finally had the chance to see them myself. There is plenty to see outdoors on the grounds, where they (the pits) are still churning up bones - there were even science folks combing through some of the more recent excavated items. There is also an indoor museum with numerous exhibits & some animatronic pieces. We could've spent more time here for sure (we are the sort that enjoy reading plaques and information boards) - truly an interesting place. And of course visit the gift shop - for a souvenir.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Howietravels
30,"No Dinosaurs, but a few Mammoths","The tar pits were somewhat of a letdown for me, not living up my imagination going into the experience as I was thinking dinosaurs, and its more about the ""ice age"" creatures that existed between the time of dinosaurs and humans. So set your expectations to saber tooth cats and Mammoths and you'll be fine. Its not an exceptionally large museum and can be viewed in a bit over an hour. It shares park grounds with the impressive LACMA, and is a few blocks from the LA Farmers Market. This makes it an easy museum to check out on the way too and from these other attractions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BVinLA
50,Worth the visit and located next door to LOCMA,"Have passed by many times and finally stopped to see the museum. Fun and informative for adults and children alike. Lots to see both on the grounds which surround the exhibit building and contain actual tar pits, and inside the exhibit building.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PGlocal_12
40,"Fun excursion, very different experience","The La Brea Tar Pits and museum were a fun surprise! We stumbled across them and decided to stop one day in LA. This is not a full day experience - you'll be doing good if it's a 1/2 day trip, but you can see most of it in 1-2 hours. The history and current archaeological finds they are still uncovering are amazing. What a gem!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/e_recruiter
40,Interesting place to visit,"We always summered in Orange County as a family. This was one place we drove to LA to see. Many dinosaur and prehistoric animals such as sabre tooth tiger models are in the museum. Also, there are skeletons to of unearthed creatures found in the tar. Outside is the black tar pits that bubble and smell very strong. Entertaining for kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mariedesjardins
50,Fascinating place in such an urban environment,"I've wanted to see this museum from when I was very young and it did not disappoint. In fact, I was pleasantly surprised by the size and breadth of the museum and its grounds (the whole area smells like an asphalt road). There is an in-door museum space that displays many skeletal examples of the types of animals that were found in the tar pits along with others of animals that lived in that time period. There is also a large display that details the modern history behind the land area (grants, owners, developers, etc). But what I found to be more interesting were the active digs presently going on and the work that continues today to discover what might still be encased in all that hardened tar! And take a walk around the pond and watch all the bubbles that continue to erupt at the surface from the escaping gases, some spout a foot or more above the surface.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dee490
50,What a gem right in LA,This was an excellent museum. We paid extra to see the 3D film which was well worth it. They have lots of skeletons of animals found in the tar pits. It took me awhile to realize why they seemed so unusual. I am used to seeing whitish skeletons in museums. These are all dark colored from absorbing the tar. Methane still bubbles up in the pits outside. This is not something you would expect to find in the middle of a city.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gardener19464
40,The Famous La Brea Tar Pits,"Ever since I was a kid in school I had heard about the La Brea tar pits and finally I had a chance to visit this historic site and museum. Of course, there is a strong petroleum smell, so be prepared. But the museum is well worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Karl2010
40,Tar pits in LA?,"For years I've heard about the tar pits and always wanted to visit. It'll be worth going back for more than a photo stop on a Starline Tour, but really enjoyed the re-enacted creatures in the pits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KarenK978
30,Not a must see - but interesting,"The museum and tar pits are interesting but I was a bit disappointed. For one, there is no sign to warn you that leaning on the railing could ruin clothing, such as my favorite shirt. Also, the museum is OK but not as interactive and exciting as I was hoping.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LouiseASL
50,Really interesting visit!,"I visited the museum on a weekday. Very spacious with a lot to see. The highlights included seeing scientists actually working with bones, and seeing the active excavation of the tar pits. The movie is also worth watching.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jillbertnyc
40,"Great place, most of stuff is free","Came while I was in town for business, paid at the lot which was $12 but there seemed to be some easily accessible meters on the road behind the park/museum. Paid the $12 for the museum admission and took the excavator group tour with Ashley who was great, especially with the kids in the group. Most of what we saw on the tour was viewable for free except the observation pit which is just a re-creation of a real pit. No real pits going on right now, the only action is the excavators working boxes dug up from the LA art museum parking garage next door. If you have kids well worth just walking around the grounds for free, including the people working the boxes. Museum was fairly small with some skeletal displays and history of the pits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FloodOfHunger
40,Amazing Urban Adventure,"The movie, tour, and displays are excellent. Spend at least 2 hours here to understand how the fossils of mammoths, saber-tooth tigers, and other species from the last Ice Age ended up in such a concentrated way in such a location.The Museum tells the story of the tar pits and presents specimens excavated from them. You can walk around the park and see the tar pits. On the grounds of the park are life-size models of prehistoric animals in or near the tar pits.One of the pits is still regularly excavated by researchers and can be seen at a viewing station. Paleontologists supervise and direct the work of volunteers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ken07960
50,Great family museum!,"Having lived in LA for many years (we've since moved out of the area), I've been to the La Brea Tar Pits and Museum many times. It's a great place to spend the day with your family. It is very kid friendly, as expected, and there is a lot of paleontology to learn on site. Located conveniently in center city (Wilshire and La Brea Blvd). Next door is the LA County Museum of Art and the Peterson Auto Museum so you can spend a weekend just doing museums. Great fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BruinontheGo
20,Interesting Once...,"Go just because it exists if you haven't seen it. But once is enough. Good museum, the grounds have several small fenced off areas of ""Tar"".Attached are several other art museum's.Parking is easy.We did it in 1 1/2 hours easily.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joycek26
40,Kids will love all dinosaur history in this place,It is a tourist place right in the middle of the city. It also had small museum about the pit and the discovery of dinosaur in the area. Kids will love this place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ianfH835SY
50,Among the bubbling tar,The museum is fascinating to go through. The exhibits are interesting. Walking the grounds to view the different tar pits is also well worth the walk. I look forward to returning.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/loisw65
50,Fascinating and educational,Enjoyed this very much. Both the actual tar pits and the museum are highly recommended. I would suggest you join a free tour of the actual tar pits. The guide is very knowledgeable and appreciates questions. He really explains how all this happened and still happening. Museum also excellent without being overwhelming.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NittanyLioness73
50,Just nearly under those Skyscrappers is a history unfolding,"This park has easy parking, December 19 2017, $12. Access to the park is free..access to the museum walk through does cost. Very nice clean park in Los Angeles were one can see the tar pits, so much oil in The area, still can see the many nodding donkeys. Very enjoyable and educational with children.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Partsman999
40,Thoroughly enjoyable,"Who would have thought tar pits in the middle of LA would have proved such a winner... with the 4 and 7 year old in tow we were entertained and educated without being overwhelmed. Recommend buying the tickets with the 3D and Sabre Tooth show included- the Sabre Tooth show was especially fascinating for the kids. What really sets this place apart from museums in general is the fact that they are working in the tar pits digging the bones up,they provide great viewing spots to watch these talented team do their work.Big recommendation for families with kids if all ages, loved it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/617michaelh
50,Awesome! All 7 of us loved the day!,"We took the guided tour. Staff of the tar pits are friendly and very knowledgeable. The 3D movie is great and worth the extra $$. There is no where else like this place, a must see!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/d0veg
50,Amazing history,We visited on a beautiful warm December day when the tar pits were very active. Fascinating place to visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ishumoo
50,Nice Day Visit,Active tar pit in middle of the City. I don't get the 3 star ratings. This isn't just a museum it is an active dig for bones thousands of years old. 1-2 hour visit with plenty to see inside and out. Reasonable price for this kind of attraction. Plenty of close parking. The tar pits themselves are amazing! Great tourist attraction.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Judpma012
50,Nothing like it anywhere else!,"There;s nothing like this in any other U.S. city. The tar pits are pretty gross, but really cool. The museum has many fossils found right in the tar pits, and the staff are very nice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/longislander22
50,excellent place to teach kids about the dinosaurs and archaeology.,the out side has a grand area of tar pits to see and see as some things naturally are coming to surface.the inside shows even more with archaeologist actually uncovering bones as they can walk to the glass and see first hand. As a school field trip you can also get a escort to tell them even more.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/armyphotoguy
40,Raining at the Tar Pits,"We made a day for the visit and also visited the Grove and Farmer's Market nearby. Because of the rain we were rushed in the outdoor portion of the visit to the actual tar pit site but we enjoyed the museum exhibits and the surprising number of fossils recovered. The founder of Mission Pak,, George C. Page, created a remarkable museum here which is apart of his great philanthropy throughout Los Angeles, We were entertained by our grandchildren's reaction to sabre toothed tigers, wooley mammoths and the hundreds of wolf skeletons and skulls recovered here. It is a remarkable place and a treasure for generations to come.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Q5975SFstevep
30,diapointing.,dont pay to go inside just walk around the campus for free. there is only one buliding with an exhibit inside. nothing to crazy there that I hadn't seen at other history museums.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/justins866
40,One of a Kind Natural occurance,"It is free, it is outdoors and and has (if it is open) a small museum where the research continues on pre historic creatures.. Many schools take their students there to see the hot bubbling tar from the earth. It is on the same grounds as the LA Country Art Museum so allow a little extra walking time. Certainly worth the extra 10 minutes to see it. I live in LA and it is part of the landscape on our important street Wilshire Blvd- which runs from downtown straight to the ocean.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joanneg28
40,Fascinating,Interesting view into the often tedious work that goes into being an archeologist. Guide was informative and engaging. 3D movie about ice age just ok. They need the team from Disney Nature to make an updated version!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LillyPBellevue_WA
50,Awesome stop in Downtown Los Angeles near other museums also,"Loved seeing digs right in Downtown from a window that is, they have lots of cool displays and great gift shop, I bought book ends in rose Quartz. Very worthy stop when in LA LA Land.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HeatherColoradogirl
40,Excellent half day adventure,Very clean and well organized. Lots of information and probably more if you go with a tour guide.100s and 100s of fossils on display.We spent 3 hours there and enjoyed it very much.Drawback is that the tar pits have tall fences and make pictures all but impossible.Parking is an extra $12.00.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/318bks
40,Great afternoon trip,"Able to see the 3D movie, the ice age show and the walking tour to learn more and see some of project 23. Walked around outside and saw the pits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/159candyh
50,Excellent short half day activity.,Bubbling tar pits were cool. 3D movie was sold out when we arrived so book in advance on internet. Grounds were pretty and very interesting to find in the middle of the city. Right next door to Los Angeles Modern Art museum which is also very cool. You could make a day of the the two.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gothamcitymom
50,Visit the Past,"Very educational. There were Mammoth fossils found 20,000 years apart, but in the same location. There are active Archaeology sites being dug on site. There are Palaeontologists on site, and you can view them identifying fossils, putting fossil pieces together, and cleaning the fossils. There are many fossils on display. Outside is an eye opener as you can see methane bubbling up from within the ponds. There is an explanation about how the animals from 20-60 thousand years got caught in tar (crude oil) and got stuck there until their fossils were found! There is a gift shop too. I spent just over two hours looking at the displays. I didn't see everything, a return visit is a must for me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/916elled
40,Museum closed,"Interesting outdoor pits and park area, unfortunately museum was closed. Good signage for pits but hard to take pictures because of fencing. Would be nice to have cut outs for pictures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/355stevez
50,Amazing,"Enjoyed our visit and tour of the complex, great place for families. Our tour guide was enthusastic about her work and explained it in language that even a child could understand. VEry enjoyable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EWeave3
50,Great history lesson,If your into saber-toothed tigers and mammoths this is the place to come. This place will entertain the kids as well as the adults... Watching the tar bubble is a sight to behold...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z221BNmartinp
50,Archaeology at work,"We love the La Brea Tar Pits. It is fascinating to watch the scientists at work, browse the museum and think about the ancient history belong modern day Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kazkey
40,Tar pits really interesting,Just imagining what was here hundreds of years ago - the tar pits don't disappoint. Great 3D movie - Great Wall of storytelling. The museum was small but things inside were pretty cool. Seeing paleontologists work was pretty cool too. Not something you get to see every day. Would definitely recommend for any age.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andrearobmac
50,Worth it,This place is really worth it. Good for young and old. Easy to find with good parking. Lots to do on the grounds and in the museum.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LCW270
50,Fascinating,Our tour bus made a quick stop here and we didn't have time to visit inside the museum. Even without a museum visit this was one of the highlights of our trip. It's amazing that this is located right in the middle of the city. I highly recommend it and wish I had been able to spend more time there. My whole family was amazed by this!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luvtotravel0330
50,"Wilshire Blvd 3,000 B.C","One of the most jaw dropping incredible must do spots in L.A. the history and ability to see entire food chains of animals from thousands of years ago is Awe-inspiring. Spend the entire day and have the whole experience - you will be astounded, amazed and blown away. Favorite part was seeing a ghost sabre tooth tiger. Had no clue they existed!!! Wild, wild, wild experience. Wish I had bought one of those tourist shirts - Wilshire Blvd 3,000 B.C. (creative genius whoever came up with this) gift shop was dope too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spiderwoman808
40,Interesting location,"I've heard about the tar pits throughout my life, but this was my first visit. The museum was well laid out and I found the ability to actually watch scientists sorting matrix for micro fossils with a camel hair brush fascinating. The 3D movie was well done and worthwhile. Walking around the grounds, the pits and the ongoing excavations were quite interesting. Plan on 2-3 hours to do the museum and grounds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Roadtripsters2015
40,fun for all ages,Enjoyed our visit to La Brea - museum is small - but visiting the open dig was interesting as was the paleontologists talk.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelmom2238
40,Interesting historical location and museum,"It took me almost 30 years to visit this museum, but I am glad I did. We did a short guided tour of the grounds which was very informative. The museum is also very interesting including watching some of the archeologists working on the bones that have been excavated from the site.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lorne29
50,Real life excavations in a tar pitt !,We enjoyed ourselves and were fascinated with the Tar pitt's. There are actual excavations taking place daily and you can see what's going on in the fossil lab and talk to the Paleontologists at a specific time of the day. The IMAX movie was lovely and the fossil of the woolly mammoth was just amazing. You can spend a whole day here just exploring the place. Some of the exhibit's are outside and it can get hot but this is one place where adults and kids can both learn and enjoy !,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RajikaSD
50,Real life archeology,"Amazing collection of bones and fossils on display, IMAX movie and real life excavations happening before your eyes",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/589RachelH
50,Wow!,"We spent a late afternoon here. We walked around the Tar pits which is free and very informing, this tip our interest enough that we decided to go check out the museum. We got there at 4:25pm and the friendly staff advised us to hold off for 5mins as it would then be half price. Walking around the museum in 30 minutes is not a problem with plenty of time to chill, watch scientists at work and get stuck into reading each display. Don't miss out on this place it's a live archeological site.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AzzaRich
50,Natural history alive & well in central LA....,"On my must-do list when in LA, the La Brea Tar Pits are something I have known about most of my life so to finally visit them was very exciting. You can see actual skeletons still in the oily goo as well as bubbling outcrops all over the park! The displays of skeletons of different ice-age animals found there are very informative, as is the view into the scientific workshop where the exhumed skeletons are prepared for display. The garden is very relaxing and attracts some excellent bird-life - saw a beautiful humming-bird while we were there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jackie1961994
30,It's ok,"It's not David Attenborough great, and comes across as tired and a bit dated. It is an interesting period of time that still has more for us to discover, but it's not really showing that.The skeletal reconstructions were great but the displays are a little dated, with a lack of interaction for kids and the animatronics old, some of which aren't even to scale. Having a Mammoth in the display, make it a mammoth size.The ice age movie seemingly in 3D, but I didn't notice what exactly was in 3D, so they could have saved the money/gimmick.The Pits don't add much to the park apart from the smell, and you can't see the staff working or ask them questions.Maybe need more funding to update the actual museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/onemadcow2015
40,Surprise in LA,"Absolutely fascinating and unexpected find in the middle of Los Angeles,watch the processes of paleontology unfold before your eyes.Wander around the Pleistocene garden in Hancock Park,bubbling tar pits where sabre toothed cats,dire wolves and mammoths became entrapped and are still being uncovered. This is home to the world's most famous Ice Age fossil excavation site and totally worth a visit.The park is free however entry to the museum in the park attracts a fee.While there consider a short walk to the farmers market at The Grove nearby,lovely place to enjoy local produce for lunch and check out the lay back shopping.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DavidR841
50,Fascinating,"I never realised this is right in the middle of LA. The tar pit that trapped thousands of ice age animals is still there, next to a museum with exhibits of skeletons, dioramas, and a student palaeontologist cleaning bones. It is remarkable to think that this landscape filled with mastodons and dire wolves is now a busy city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jafdip
50,Excellent educational opportunity!,"You will be surprised by the location of the La Brea Tar Pits in a crowded area of Los Angeles. But once you're inside the grounds, the city fades away and you're taken back to a time when prehistoric man eked out a living by fighting and defeating a variety of now-extinct mammals. A real life ""Flintstones"", if you will.I would recommend visiting this museum many times.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CostaRicaBirder
50,Man they were big,"What a wonderful place to visit. They have a roomy parking garage, and once parked much of the park is free to enjoy. However, a directory in the garage would have been appreciated. The displays in the museum are well done and to my surprise some of the animals on display were the largest of their kind (such as the camel). What a wonderful display!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LEastsound
50,Unique,"A great place to spend three hours or so. It's amazing to think central LA was once teeming with wildlife- huge mammoths, sabre tooth cats, wolves and giant sloths. The experts working on the site were keen to share their knowledge. Animals such as squirrels are still getting stuck in the pits and we were told they rescued a duck the previous week!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/533dar
50,Different than expected and better,"I don't know what I was expecting, but I've heard about the tar pits since I was in school (many years ago). They're not what I expected. Some were ponds with oily film and some were more tar. I guess the biggest surprise was they're really in the middle of everything and around the corner from Beverly Hills. Not cheap but very interesting for the whole family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SDogg1963
40,The only place like this in the world,Very unique. Tons of fossils all found on site. You can observe the archaeologists and paleontologists during their normal work day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MikeMc666
30,Only for kids,"Very dissapointing, over priced and over rated. Better off reading up on the Internet or books. Plenty of school trips visiting during our visit, probably a excellent school trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/25611111
40,Better than expected,I found it very interesting and the history of the tar pits is very fun. Museum was fun to go through. You can actually see the tar pits outside and they are still findibg things in the continually seeping tar.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seattletraveler5
50,Worth a visit,"Due to the tar pits, they have a unique collection of fossils and lot's of them. They have two displays that show the sheer number. A display of over 200 wolf skulls on a wall. Their largest fossil is a mammoth. No large dinosaurs here. You can tour sine of the tar pits on the site and see and smell them. Unique museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/875jl
50,Awesome!,Such a wonderful layout researching our the area thousands of years ago. You can see many tar pits on the grounds and the museum is well worth visiting.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suebC7570OS
40,What an amazing place!,"I hadn't been here in 20+ years and took 2 friends who had never been. I had NO IDEA how incredible it has become! All I remember was the tar pits in the front. We are three adults and it was so interesting, educational and seriously mind-blowing to see the new pits being excavated, to see all of the bones, and to even see the scientists working while we were there. What a wonderful afternoon!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheVillaHermosaCR
30,LA Tar Pits,"My son wanted to go so we decided to stop by. We only did the outdoor walking tour which took about 45 minutes. The smell is bad and it really isn't my kind of exploration. The grounds we're well taken care of and the exhibits were nice and informative. Great place to walk around and I'm sure the museums were nice, we just didn't go inside. Great place to walk around and stretch your legs. There even was a nice restroom building to use. It's set up in a park setting with nice paths and pleanty of grass which is hard to find in a big city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tonette3
50,Amazing place to visit!,The pits themselves are free! The museum is very interesting and affordable. The 3D movie is worth the extra money!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ttpurplern
50,Amazing place! Should definitely visit,I found out about this place from my friends who live in LA. It was a very unique experience. I hadn't even heard of something like this before and it was even better because it was in the heart of the city. So it was very easily accessible. Only the museum needs a ticket and the garden and outdoor area is free. That is the best part to see too. Would recommend to see the garden first and then go to the museum. Could very easily see the tar pits bubbling. There are tons of fossils out for display and I found that people from all age groups were having a good time. I would recommend everyone who visits the city to go for this. Personally I found this place to be more exciting than LACMA which seemed more crowded.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dream597106
40,Nice Little Museum,Stopped in the see the famous La Brea Tar Pits. It is incredible the amount of fossils that they have recovered in the pits. I enjoyed the timeline showing the local animals and such.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Avrin2
50,Very interesting Museum!,"Nothing disappointing about this museum. The art work was colorful, unique, the Superhero portion was great for the young and the old. I foundThe Tar Pits a interesting find as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/altheiab
50,Great diversion!,"During a recent business trip I had the opportunity to visit the Tar Pits. Very interesting place. It's great to support the museum and worth the admission to see the museum, but you can walk around the Tar pits for free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WestG65
40,Very interesting history of the oil lake and animals,Not sure if my title of review is accurate but we thoroughly enjoyed the history behind the saber tooth tiger and others. Can be done in under 90 minutes if you are pressed for time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JAR817
50,Unique Destination,"There are, I believe, only two places in the world that exhibits bones buried in tar which reveal the age of saber tooth tigers, mammoths and other extinct mammals. La Brea Tar Pits is one of those two places. The animals long ago sank in the tar pits which were covered with a shallow layer of water and thus became victims and scientific specimens. There is a fee to pay to enter the museum, but I have always found it well worth the price to show out of state visitors the skeletons of mammoths, saber tooth tigers and dire wolves. There is also a display where you can watch workers clean the bones out of the hardened tar. There is furthermore a video room where you can find out about the extinct animals. In front of the museum there is a pond showing how a mammoth was caught in the tar. Saber tooth tigers would attack the victims caught in the tar and thus become victims of the viscous fluid themselves. Behind the building you can see excavation pits where bones have been removed. The museum and grounds are a fascinating visit. The museum is also located within walking distance to the L.A. County Art Museum and a visit to the Tar Pits and the Art Museum make a days sightseeing quite convenient.I have found my out of state and foreign visitors have quite enjoyed visiting both museums.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bleeson8
50,A really fun place for the family to visit.,Bring the kids or grandkids and be prepared for a lot of fun. The exhibits are really fastenating and educational. But be prepared... you'll have a really hard time getting the kids out of the gift shop!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/131RichardM131
40,History and Science Museum worth seeing,"This place is next door to LACMA and has a decent sized parking lot off the side street. The grounds are fairly flat with various pits scattered about with information on the ice age, the various bones discovered in the pits along with details in how the scientists go about excavating the pits.The museum explains the history of the area, has many displays of extinct animals found in the pits (mammoths, saber tooth tigers, sloths and more) along with a lab to see scientists at work, and a wonderful 3-D. Film that explains the ice age, global warming, and ties it all back to the animals found in the tar pits.A wonderful place for anyone that enjoys history and science.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wendya01
50,Great place for science and natural history buffs,"A wonderful site to visit, with a mind-boggling display of fossils taken from the pits. I had no idea that the pits are still active and that fossil excavation and research is still taking place. They have a glassed-in lab where you can watch scientists sift through excavated material to find fossil bones. I saw two youngsters,maybe 5 or 6 years old, watch mesmerized as a scientist showed them on a screen the tiny bone that she had just isolated on her microscope. Neat place for young and old.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kath_Berkshires
40,"Museum was nice, tar pits were a little disappointing","The museum on the site was really nice. Lots of fossils and a great display. Lab workers were on site sorting dirt for fossils, which was cool to watch.Tar pits themselves were a little disappointing. Not sure what I was expecting, but they had some trash in them, and just looked like muck. The tar bubbles were fun though!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WarRaptor
50,"Always wanted to see this place, fascinating","Went here with wife and 12 yr old daughter. Always wanted to see this place as it has a prehistoric feel to it.Found the lake pit a great walk around. The smaller tar pits aren't much to look at, but the museum is an interesting experience.Good learning opportunity in the museum, especially for kids with an interest in dinosaurs.Across the street from the tar pits are a bunch of food trucks which are great if you are looking for eats nearby.Much of this area you could walk through for free, but the museum and parking will cost you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ProfessorX69
50,Unique!,"Being a former student of Quaternary Science, visiting La Brea Tar Pits was like a pilgrimage! After many years of reading about La Brea as a case study in lectures, it was wonderful to actually visit this iconic and unique location. The museum is very informative and engaging and the specimens on display are stunning! We enjoyed walking around the grounds and saw current and previous excavation pits. All the staff we encountered were very friendly and welcoming and there is a gated car park at the rear of the museum to park in, which from memory cost about $12 I think. We spent around 90 minutes here and even though I'm biased, I would recommend people visit as La Brea is such a unique scenario and we're very fortunate to have uncovered it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chick-pea-222
40,Interesting to see,"My wife had long wanted to see the La Brea tar pits. Like everywhere in LA, the parking is expensive. The tar pits themselves were not expensive given they are the attraction. We took the excavators tour, which was well worth it (included). You sort of need the person to explain what you are seeing. Our tour guide was extremely good, and was great at answering questions as well as anticipating questions.The fossils are pretty amazing. But, it is the whole experience that makes it worth while. Imagining the animals getting caught in the asphalt is horrible to think about, but how predators also got caught is an intriguing aspect of nature.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TeddyDove
40,amazing,"found the tar pitts great and very interesting, lots to see and great staff whom are most interesting to listen to and very Knowledgable",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/856shaneo
40,An unique museum,"Definitely this is an unique museum. As I can say, it is a park rather than museum. For park wise, it is free. The famous tar pits is good to look. The museum is a traditional style. The 3D show is plus but few more dollars. The location is near the downtown. Parking fee is more than museum ticket.Overall wise this is a good place for family activity during weekend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hwang123
50,Very interesting place,An amazing place to visit. Tomsee ll the bones they hace dug up and put together to create the exhibits are fascinating.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/woodwormenterprise
40,Very Cool!,"Pretty damn cool that this still exsists in the middle of a massive city!! The tar pits arent exactly what i was expecting but still very cool!! The open excavation observing was awsome to see! Definetly would have been nice to know that to walk around just the tar pits was free and it was only the museum part that required payment as we had just spent the previous 3 hours at the Natural History Museum, didnt really need to spend another $23 to see what we aready had seen ( bought the combo ticket). It was still very good though, would definetly recommend it to everyone",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shagg2016
30,Interesting but no loss if you skip it,The museum was interesting to walk through and see the bones that have been collected. There is a display window to see back to the lab where they are cleaning more debris looking for tiny fossils. We waited for the tour which never started and ended up walking the grounds on our own. Glad I did it but will not return nor recommend. Parking is $12 which is the same price as the admission to the museum which seems a little steep to me.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/670AndreaH
50,LA before it was LA,"LA didn't have dinosaurs but it had a collection of large and small tar pits which when covered with water appeared to be small ponds. Prehistoric animals, such as mammoths, sabertoothed cats, dire wolves, giant sloths, and short-faced bears would, unfortunately, for them, but fortunately for us, walk in the water, getting stuck and remaining there to be found, thousands of years later. The Page Museum does a wonderful job in telling their story, and continues to excavate in the tarpits",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/308JohnO
40,Who would have thoughts had dinousaurs in LA??,"Interesting place, smack in the middle of a busy city is an actual place where dinosaur fossils were found. Could be a little more interactive for kids, but for adults, the set up is fine.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/444keithu
50,Amazing,"This was amazing, and so well presented.Right in the middle of the city.As you watch the bubbling tar, your just hoping a sabre tooth tiger will just pop up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wander400141
50,Excellent research centre and museum,"The tar pits are quite incredible. I first learnt about them in the 1997 movie Volcano. When we planned our holiday in LA I knew we had to see if they were real or just a prop.They're real! And they're awesome! And a bit smelly, and bubbly, and full of bones! Super cool.We chatted with one of the museum volunteers who was hugely informative and interesting to talk to. He expressed annoyance at the wooly mammoth exhibit (they were never in LA) and instead talked about the various species (extinct and living) that had been excavated from the pits.Definitely a highlight!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cherry_black83
50,Take the tour!,"Experienced a wonderful few hours touring this museum and grounds. If you are into fossils and history, this is your place. Real time excavation and finding of fossils. The fossil lab is an area where you can see fossil preparators sort and clean latest discoveries . Also a 3D theater is on site.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nancyqc
40,Feel and smell the history,"This was one thing I wanted to visit in our short trip to LA. However, my wife was so impressed she wants to come again next time we visit. We opted out of the movies as there were school trips on the day we went, but the museum itself had just the right balance of science and information. The exhibits were all excellent and watching the volunteers slowly cleaning the fossils was something to behold.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Davethepubsinger
40,Good place to learn about paleontology,"I had no expectations coming to this attraction. A friend recommended the site and it was close to the hotel I was staying, so I decided to take a shot.It was fun to see the bubbly lake with natural asphalt and a good opportunity for cool videos.The museum itself has an amazing collection of fossils, making for great photography.The staff was impeccable, extremely helpful and always with a smile.It is a good place for kids, but adults like me will certainly enjoy it as well. It was a great morning to learn about paleontology!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nomad159533
50,Step back in time,Standing above an oil field in central LA. Museum contained fascinating dinosaur bones and explained the history of the site very well,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/442AngelaL
40,What Happened to the Wooly Mammoths?,My Uber driver was great - he brought me from the Walk of Stars to the Hollywood Sign and then the tar pits. There are two museums on the site as well as the oozy gooey bubbly tar pit. I gawked for a while and am glad I did. You can probably spend all day at the museums - I spent about a half hour and split. Well worth it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MatthewR563
50,In the midst of the hustle and bustle of the modern world...,"For curious adults and kids alike, it really makes you think what's right under your feet. This is a working museum, so new discoveries are surfacing all the time. I'd advise also springing for the Pit Tour, if you have the time as you'd get to see discoveries *while the scientist are finding them for themselves!*",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/breezinlo
40,Who doesn't love the smell of asphalt?,"What a fascinating geological oddity! I really wish I lived nearby so that I could volunteer. They have so much evidence and information packed away in crates, waiting to be catalogued... The lake pit, with its dramatic methane bubbles, was my favorite part, but each of the outdoor exhibits is interesting and the museum has some very cool exhibits. The reconstructed skeletons and models of saber-toothed cats, dire wolves, antique bison, the preserved insects and small mammals... I felt educated, entertained, and a little bit jealous of the people who get to participate in sorting and cleaning the materials gathered from the area. I'm sure it can get tedious, sorting through tiny bits of rubble for mouse toe bones, but so rewarding, knowing that you're contributing to that kind of treasure trove of information.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Laene
50,Quality museum!,"I really enjoyed my experience here. The museum was clean, thorough, and organized. I learned a lot. The gift shop was small but top-notch; I've been to a lot of a gift shops and I was quite impressed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ktmtqt
30,Tar pits,The Tar Pits were not what I was expecting. The main tar pit area is much smaller than I thought (but the overall site is very large). It was nice that you could walk around for free. We did not cover the whole area so there could be some paid activities. If you have limited time this is a quick stop and look site.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Monty_RTA
40,Another side to LA,"Close to the city and more history than modern LA - in its own way, this is far more interesting than seeing the irrelevance of modern movie making.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RonWamberal
40,Visit the Pits!!,Our family of 4 (teens and parents) pulled into Hollywood today. We drove over to check it out and it happened to be just after 5pm. No one was there to collect parking fee ($12) and we knew we didn't need to go into the museum itself. We just walked the park and visited and read about the pits. It was a perfect experience and a gorgeous early evening visit. We all enjoyed our visit and especially the 'free' experience of it all.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michelledQ236SW
50,Best LA Attraction,"In a place famous for facades and fake stuff, this is the real deal. The 'park' where the tar pits and excavations are is FREE. The museum is amazing and worth the admission price. Plus, it's near the Los Angeles County Museum of Art which is worth a look.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/manofsteel276
50,Fun Experience,Got to visit with my 5 year old. She had a blast and was mesmerized by the Woolly Mammoth fossil display.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ljd808
50,Bucket list checked,"I wanted to visit the tar pits last time I was in LA but didn't make time. This time we spent a really enjoyable afternoon exploring the museum and then moving to the outdoor exhibits.The kids will love this attraction, and for the adults there is plenty of interesting information as well.Gift shop was great with many unique and quirky gifts that we haven't seen in other stores.Reasonable entry fee to the museum, or you can walk around the outdoor park area for no charge.Learn about the geology of the area, the thousands of fossils found and watch the scientists and volunteers working live in the workshop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suebD3058ZE
50,Awesome family fun!,"Love the Tar Pits! Our 13 year old son (and my husband) really enjoyed this place. Walk around the grounds, smell the tar pits, and learn something all at the same time. This was a great break from the amusement parks, and who doesn't love dinosaurs?!! Great movie inside the museum and tons of interactive exhibits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shannons427
50,Los Angeles Pre-History,"This was rad. Thousands of exhibits of fossilized prehistory. Only wish I had more time to spend here in Los Angeles. I stuck a stick in the tar pit and kept some, what are you gonna do son?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/26MatthewF
30,Tar Pits,Fascinating history and incredible how the sort the fossils out of the tar intact - you can actually see them doing this in the lab area. Friendly staff and well maintained. Only slight thing against is its quite expensive for what it is and the souvenir prices are ludicrous. Glad we went though.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G_O_C479
50,Amazing surprise in the middle of LA!,"One of the first things I learned is that brea means tar in Spanish. La Brea Avenue has been named thus because of the presence of tar pits, in the middle of LA! These tar pits are still being investigated, and the secrets uncovered in this sticky black stuff are all related to the wildlife that habited this county thousands of years ago. Huge sloths, sabre tooth tigers, huge beers and mamoths! The area is great to walk around, and to relax in the sun. The museum is absolutely worth a tour, to see what has been disovered in these pits, and what is known about these ancient animals.Right next to LA musem of Art, it is very accesable and easy to combine with a visit to the Museum of Art.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/192marav
40,Fascinating,"Amazing to see such a sight/site in down town Los Angeles !!Excellent tour of the facilities with our guide. Short, sweet and very informative. The 3-D movie was really well done. It does not take long to tour the entire grounds. Much of it is in some very relaxing parkland, so bring a picnic as there is no food within the facility. Loved watching them work under the microscope in the 'fishbowl'",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JudiK189
50,The La Brea Tar Pits are a must visit!,Wow!Educational and amazing to witness this era of time.Real tar pits still seeping.Entire skeletons of many ice age mammals & animalsTake the walking tour.Watch the movie.Walk back in time.Archeologists working on site.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LarryP391
50,Asphalt Legend,"I had wanted to visit this place all my life, and it did not disappoint. It is a park containing asphalt pits where animals have been getting stuck and fossilized for tens of thousands of years, and a museum that houses some of the mounted skeletons. You can see how fossils are cleaned in the lab, and how they are excavated outside. There is also a prehistoric garden. The sheer numbers of animals they have found is staggering. If you want to visit, you can get a discount through GoCard. Arrive early in the morning before the crowds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/171maryjaned
30,Nice to see when you are nearby,"It is not realy a thing you must see, It is a museaum and a park with one great and a few small Tar Pits",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robv605
50,Wonderful learning experience,"So, it's a tar pit. If you want to know beyond the obvious, visit the museum where exhibits will take you from prehistoric times to current tar pit activity. The fact that they have excavated millions of items from the various tar pit in the area is amazing. They have also cleaned them and put them into informative displays, movies and talks given by the staff. You can even watch as skeletons are being extracted from their thousands of years-old traps. It's not in the easiest accessible area, but there is plenty of parking at meters on the street. There's a gift shop and hill for the kids to roll down, too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/grip652
50,Must See Geological Site,"Beautiful, maintained venue with active dig and excavation site(s). Helpful staff and very educational. Must see for those who desire to know about the geological history of the Los Angeles area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Netwalker2k15
50,Very educational,"I took my 6 year old to the museum on Sunday. It was not crowded (great!) very friendly staff, and the movie they show is definitely worth to see. My daughter enjoyed a lot and learned a lot. I definitely recommend this museum for everyone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SuzanP842
50,This is a 'must-see' museum,"If you want to see real tar pits and learn about ongoing archeology and paleontology study, this is the place. The incredible skeletons of Dire Wolves alone make the visit memorable. My husband and I were jaw dropped at the amount of work it takes to recover, clean and reassemble the bones of so many prehistoric animals. If you are fortunate, you can watch some of the work being done.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2OnTheRoad2014
30,An unusual and interesting site if you are interested in fossils,"I was amazed at just how many animals had met their fates through the years in these tar pits. A particularly clever example of how easy it was for animals to be trapped, was a visitor interactive tar plunger! The apparent ease of trapping then became so clear. A wonderful range of exhibits, with additional interest by being able to view of the laboratories where scientists are still working, with explanations of their current tasks.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/683simonf
40,Quite interesting,"I have wanted to see this since I saw it in some mediocre asteroid movie in college. If you have any interest in paleontology, it is worth a visit. I didn't go into the museum, but the outdoor areas (the actual pits) have good interpretive signage and it is a free visit. They are still actively working the pits and will be for a very long time to come, and you can see people going through the asphalt looking for fossils any day of the week. Nice part of Culver City with many museums and medium-level and chain restaurants. Recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DrMomPhD
40,PREHISTORIC TIMES IN LA,"The tar pits themselves are an interesting spectacle, but the museum inside and the relics and skeletons dug up from those pits are very much worth the effort to see a bygone era.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/normane362
50,Cool solo atteaction,"My parents wanted to do other things so I went alone!Make sure you go early to get a good parking space (that's if you are driving there). Spaces get filled quickly.This attraction might not of free entrance but it was worth it.The museum itself might be small but I recommend the excavation site tour, it takes you outside the museum and all around the park with a guide. It was very interesting and informative. The main original and first pit is closed for normal park goers when I went and you have to be on the tour to enter.I also recommend checking out the various 3D shows available to watch",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YasmineZikry
50,Simply fascinating,"The Page Museum and grounds of what should properly, but unromantically, be called the asphalt seeps is a gem.It is clearly and scientifically set out but has exhibits of artistic and emotional merit. The visitor is drawn in by the idea of mammoths and wolves roaming Wilshire Boulevard and can see exhibits of the finds and their reconstructions. One can then discover exactly what took place in this area of naturally occurring asphalt, how the animals were stuck in the ""tar"" and the equally interesting story of how the area was settled and the bones discovered.The cataloguing, the 23 containers and the room where you can watch volunteers and scientists working are just terrific.All beautifully landscaped and well set-out.People who work there are friendly and knowledgeable, as well as fun.I loved the place and went twice during a recent three day trip to LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/447JennyH
40,Right in the middle of Los Angeles,I had read about this place so decided to visit on our Trip to LA. We parked about 2 blocks away and we could smell the Tar as we got closer to the site. Unfortunately the Museum had just closed when we got there but walking around the site and reading all the information signs was fascinating enough. I would highly recommend this place if you are visiting LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JuliSydney_Australia
30,Nice,"I only like it. No more comment. I was walking around and inside all nice for walking. Finally, if you want go to somewhere for walking just go there and have fine.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MohammadNAlrammah
40,Nice to find a tourist attraction where I learned something ;-),"My husband has wanted to see the LaBrea tar pits since he was in first grade, and since this trip was a ""bucket list check-off"" trip for him, we made sure to visit. Wow, it was so much better than we expected it would be. The tar pits are really bizarre, and the museum does a great job explaining how the tar pits came to be and what they were used for. There was a chance to explore the grounds and see current excavations and learn about the fossils that are still being found. If you are interested in the prehistoric era and fossils, you have to visit the LaBrea tar pits. It's mind-boggling to think this is smack in the middle of busy LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maybayjay
40,Very cool pleistocene era experience,"Lots of fun for any age! Actually can smell the asphalt (a natural substance found in this area)! The exhibits are fun for even young kids as well as anyone wondering about saber-toothed tigers, mammoths and mastodons as well as lots of other interesting giant animals of that era! Can do it in 1-2 hours and parking was very easy on a weekday ($12). Exhibits free, but there is a charge for the Imax movie.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dmnurse2016
50,Smelly History !!,"It smells like someone is tarmacing the road. The pits themselves are quite understated but bubbling and thought provoking. The museum is amazing. A real wooly mammoth skeleton and sabre tooth tigers. A real display of skeletons excavated, a history of the tar pits and the modern day site which is still being dug. Really enjoyable with several guides enthusiastically telling you about what you are looking at.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scubagirl51
50,Good nerdy time,"We always take the grandkids to someplace where they can learn something new while we're on vaca. They really enjoyed this place and thought the pits were 'cool but sad'. See the movie, too",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Auntzann
50,Educational and surprising,This was our first visit to the tar pits and the museum was well done and we learned a lot - a friend recommended this to us and it was well worth the visit. We walked the tar pits and took in everything that they had documented and then we toured the museum as well and it was very informative. We both learned a lot and would also recommend this educational hot spot to others.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IA_Catwoman
40,Smelly ... but very good!,This is really well done and very informative. I had no idea of the extent of the pits and what they have uncovered. This is really educational. Also it's free if you aren't going into the actual Museum.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LJG27
40,Educational and OOZING,Very interesting Museum and spacious grounds with several active Tar Pits. A perfect venue for all ages. Take the Excavator Tour--3D movie not so much.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ForrestL500
40,A Chance to Visit the Ice Age,"I had friends over from England and the first item on their TO DO List was La Brea! We spent a lovely afternoon walking the grounds, taking the tour and the 3D movie. The information provided does an excellent job explaining the Ice Age. And after five years of drought, it's a great idea!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deniseo632
50,Great place!,"I loved my visit to the tar pits! It was a must see for me when I was recently in LA. The grounds are free to roam but the museum is fee based. Very reasonable, especially with a coupon like I had. The displays were gorgeous and I really enjoyed observing the researchers in action. The only down fall of the park were the abundance of homeless people sleeping in the grass and panhandling in the picnic area. It personally didn't bother me but I can see how others may have found it worrisome.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HuckWeb
50,Lots of fun!,Enjoyed seeing (and smelling) the tar pits! It was interesting and we found a lot of Pokemon too. We only walked outside and did not go into the buildings. It was too pretty of a day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Champagne77007
40,Must see,"The La break ta pits are world famous and worth a stop to have a look. You can spent an hour here or a full day, just depending on how interesting you find it. To walk around the tar pits is free. To look through the museum cost for adults is $12. The park is very nice and relaxing. Very informative and interesting for young and old.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/872gabrielleb
50,Unexpected delight,"Found this on a hotel brochure ,we had a bit of time to kill before going to the airport and very glad we did . I could not believe there was active tar pits near downtown L.A! . To walk around the pits is free the museum is $12 adults . Parking was also $12 for the full day .They are still excavating the area and find fossils going back 50000 years . The storyboards around the tar pits are very informative and explained how even mammoths got stuck in the tar . There is over 10 000 fossils in the museum and there is a tour of the deeper tar pits and a 30 minute movie about the last ice age included in the admission fee .This is a must see to do in an afternoon !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/billt1958
40,Interesting Find,"After living in the L.A. area for over 30 years, we finally decided to give it enough time away from the art museum. A great place for kids and adults to learn a little about local archaeology.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mazsterm
40,Interesting and exciting!,It's so interesting that there are still active tar pits right in the middle of the city! It feels a little like you've taken a step back in time to see the rich history of the area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bmparkr1
40,History right in LA,I've heard about the tar pits for many years and thought our host was kidding when he said he was taking us there. It actually was a great experience. The museum is a nice natural history museum and the pits themselves are fascinating. Good for all ages.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MGums
50,Very Educational and Entertaining,Me and my 15 year old daughter visited this museum and made it a day trip. It was very fun and interesting to see all they had to show us. We both enjoyed the show and learning the history of the tar pits. The whole place is very well maintained. There is even a place to watch the employee's work on fossils. The price is great for the experience you will have. It can be a little crowded in some parts of the musuem.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/499BarbaraH
40,Pleasant place to walk; pretty park; small but informative museum,"Have been here several times. Great place for a walk though I wouldn't recommend it at high noon in the middle of the summer. Small but informative museum with interesting exhibits. Amazing to think that the tar pits are still ""active"".",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scubadiver_12345
30,Tar Pits... Right... Tar Pits,"Oh Yeah... There is some ""new"" tar, but most of the tar really is not that new and watching a Tar Pit can seem like watching grass grow. The good news is that the protected status may prevent one more ugly overpriced condo from being built, but at the end of the day it is a tar pit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bryanbZ3939PG
50,Nice smell,Had a great time around the tar pits. There were so many interesting things to see not just the tar oozing out of the ground. Very informative placards around the area. Also it is free to enter and wander around.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KHR62
50,Could have spent the whole day,"We learned about the Tar Pits because they were listed on our LA Go Card. We wanted to see as much as we could (to experience LA and to make the best use of our money and the Go Card purchase), so we made the Tar Pits our first attraction of four to do on our last day in LA. We only had two hours, so we had to zip through. Two hours could be enough to 'see' everything, but our group likes to read every plaque and do every interactive activity and chat with the docents, etc. we had to miss the tours and the movie, too. The place isn't really that big, but it's laid out nice and the grounds are beautiful. The volunteers were all so friendly and knowledgable-if we lived nearby, we would definitely join the team. On-site parking was $12.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/juliathegr82
50,Fascinating: worth making the time to go!,"This museum doubles as a working archaeological site with an on-site lab visitors are welcomed and encouraged to observe. The design of the museum stimulates curiosity and provides ample material for satisfying that curiosity--in the form of exhibits, films, and opportunities to observe the actual workings of the site. The pits are not always being worked on, but on the days when there is activity at one or more of the excavation sites, you could find ample reasons to prolong your stay! However, the museum and grounds are also nice for a shorter visit.Oh, and you're in for an extra treat if a guitar/mandolin-playing musician strolls in with his multiple instruments and open suitcase for tips! Take a few minutes to talk with him, and you'll go away with a lot more than you came in with!Tip: wear shoes that are comfortable for walking/standing in. The grounds are worth exploring.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joyc81

50,what a treasure in downtown LA,I went here many years ago with my kids and remember it was a great place to visit. We went again last year and were again amazed at this great treasure in such a busy downtown area. Kudos to LA for keeping it instead of building over it. It is one of a kind place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R4420XLeileenc
50,Unknown to Many,"This is a fascinating place to visit, that few have heard about.Many of the natural tar pits are accessible from the park, with viewing areas where the pits are being excavated.And, when you've seen enough outside, there's the museum containing the thousands of specimins that have been excavated over the years.Easy to find as it's down the western end of Wilshire Boulevard, on-site parking (you have to pay), definitely worth a visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BobYork
40,Los Angeles history,Fascinating tar pits right in the heart of Willshire Boulevard. Really interesting living and working museum and staff very knowledgeable. Great for kids took as the animatronics are quite lifelike.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DianaB2714
40,Very interesting site,"it is amazing that the location was so ancient, as they found the skeletons of prehistorical animals, apart from being a place where oil comes up almost naturally....worth a visit to the site.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Temper43
50,Historical Sites with so many Stories,If you love history then put this place on your list. I was kids would not love it as much as I was sure I would. I was mistaken. They loved it. My youngest son (9) kept talking about how hard it was to pull the handle out of the tar. They also loved the Ice Age Adventure show and they had many question about the lab inside. The park is beautiful so bring a lunch to enjoy the beautiful sites.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/guinnessc
40,Interesting place,"This museum visit was rather unique as I for one was unaware of the archaeology that existed on the continent hundreds of thousands to millions of years ago, as part of my month-long visit to California. Definitely a visit for friends and/or family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TashanC
50,A unique site,"Made a quick trip to La Brea Tar Pits. I allowed an hour and wish I had more time. Tusedays are free to visit the museum, but you are asked to give a donation. Everyone must check in and must wear a paper bracelet, even on free days. There is a 3D movie for an extra $4. I stayed to see the movie, but didn't think it was worth the time, much less money. You get so much more out of the exhibits and grounds. It is amazing that the tar pits preserved the bones of so many extinct animals and birds and they are still excavating the pits. This experience is quite a contrast to the madeup world of Hollywood and Disneyland.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/4Suzyq
50,Interesting museum,"The museum is worth it. We took a baby in a stroller and had no problems. It's short though, we were in a rush and did the museum in 20min which felt like enough time to see everything. There are people working on fossils behind glass in the museum. Both kids and adults will enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/353betsya
40,"A fun, unconventional sight!","Most museums have artifacts, but the tar pits here are very much still alive with oozing tar. The odor of the tar can be strong in some areas, but I still enjoyed learning about the tar pits, their history, and what researchers have excavated from the site. You can see quite a bit from just wandering in the area outside of the museum (which was free when I went).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zinear
50,Facinating,This was probably the most interesting and educational attraction that we found on our recent trip to the L.A. area. The pits were interesting and the museum was top notch. A must see!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/407JamesS
50,You can't imagine Los Angeles as a TAR PIT!!!,"This is the most interesting museum of it's kind. You have to look at the photographs of L.A. as ranches a hundred years ago to imagine what was under the land. The tar pits that seduced the mammoths and saber tooth tigers and then preserved them for eternity. There are so many animals stories and remains in the museum no one from 2 to 100 would be bored. You can't get enough, it is truly amazing. Plus outside there is a tar pit w/ animals representations to show you how it looked and how the animals fell prey to the tar. A must do for anyone, everyone and especially family's, a learning lesson for all!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelnmom3
40,Great for kids,"This is a great museum for kids. They enjoy it, learn, and have fun. I think it is worth a trip if you live a few hours away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tigger949
50,I have always wanted to visit this place!,"Located off Wilshire Blvd. in the city of LA, this easy to reach location offers a great place to just sit outside, explore the park, watch people, and if you want, go to the museum and learn about prehistoric times. I loved watching the gas bubble up through the tar and water covering it, learning more about the many animals who got stuck and perished in the tar, leaving a record for us to find millions of years later. Worth the time it took to drive and explore!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mshapiro99

40,Tar-rific Adventure!,"If you enjoy learning new facts, learning about fossils and breathing in the very memorable odor of tar, this is the place for you. There is an active dig ongoing onsite. There are active, bubbling tar pits. There are huge embedded mammal footprints to follow along the pathways. My paleontological awareness was aroused and there was actually a live tour going on for a group as we walked around the grounds on our own. There is a museum on the site for those wishing to go inside and delve a little more deeply. We really needed more time. It's a very interesting place to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/657deirdrer
50,Great fun and educational place to visit,"I am from the San Francisco Bay area and haven’t been down to Los Angeles for over a year and a half. I wanted to visit some friends in Los Angeles and then drive to San Diego to visit the USS Midway Museum. One of my friends suggested a visit to the La Brea Tar Pits. I haven't been to this museum in almost 50 years. Everything has changed, for the better I might add. As a veteran, admission was free and because I was alone, I was allowed to ""tag along"" on a private tour. They offer regular guided tours, for the public, twice a day. The new buildings, the new displays and especially the people that work there are amazing. I felt like a kid on a grade school outing. So much to learn and see, with so little time. They have huge displays of everything that's been dug up over the last 100 years, including a few dated dioramas. What I found the most interesting was the lab and Project 23. The lab is where you can watch technicians clean and sort very small fossils that were sifted out of the larger digs. At Project 23 you can watch them carefully scraping out larger fossils (bones) from the huge blocks of asphalt that had to be moved from the construction site of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, next door. All in all, this is a great fun and educational place to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AllanH443
40,Gooey!,"Very interesting displays outside explaining the Tar pits (what they are, the bones they have found etc). We didn't go into the Museum but lots of interesting stuff outside. There are plastic cones dotted around as Tar breaks through the soil all over the place! Was busy but think this is because it was a Pokemon Go stop!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/foxandsot
50,"Great for history, science, and education enthusiasts!","My hubby and I went here with a couple friends (all in our 20's). It was so cool to see all the displays, learn about the ice age, and see all that bubbling tar! Our friends were not quite as enthused, but we are pretty nerdy so we had a blast. :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/587courtneyd
40,"nice for families with kids, or anybody curious","the tar pits [if translated, patronizingly, it means 'the the tar tar pits] are v. interesting. lots of dinosaurs and other ancient creatures became bogged down, and their remains and facsimiles are in the museum, which in and of itself is v. nice, just next to the pits themselves. great for families with young kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Traveler0991
50,Neat park tucked away in the city,"We spent a couple hours at this park. I've always heard about the tar pits and was so glad I went. They have an excellent museum which is worth while. You pay a few more dollars for the 3D movie which is worth it because it brings to life the story of how the animals became trapped. Afterwards, walk around the free exhibits in the park. There is a nice cafeteria directly adjacent to the park in the art museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DoctorDerm1
50,Terrific day adventure!,"I took the kids back in ~1980's...then saw it again yesterday (some-30 years later). It's turned into an amazing place...and it has something for EVERYONE!Here are some highlights and tips:> There's plenty of space everywhere. Visitors in wheelchairs and slow-walking seniors (*wink*) have NO problem seeing everything they offer.> Parking is $12 all day. Surprisingly, each space is very narrow, and the lot is FULL of SUVs & mini-vans. Easily workable, but unusual to see in a family-orientated attraction.> Tours & programs (in the museum/pavilion) are scheduled back-to-back, so you can pay admission, go straight into the featured (indoor) programs (sitting, short shows, comfortable for young and elderly) and then join a walking guided tour of the rest of the park. That all took about 2 hours, easy walking. We headed for lunch, but you can then choose to return to the museum, to see the displays in more detail. There are LOTS of interesting things to see, and the staff is VERY knowledgeable.> The gift shop sells water, but food isn't sold on the premises (unless I missed it). But the grounds are park-like: shady and beautiful (we wished we'd brought a packed lunch and blanket).> Along with reasonable admission charges, they've got a wide selection of annual ""memberships"" that ALSO apply to the LA Natural History Museum (off 110-Exposition Park) and Hart Museum (Santa Clarita). Such a deal.> Very clean, well tended, family friendly. Great for couples, young kids, teens, friends and solos...> An easy 1-2 miles away is ""Little Ethiopia"" around Fairfax Ave...a nice selection of 4.5-5 star restaurants featuring wonderful foods of a different culture.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/flipat60
50,Educational experience,The time spent at La Brea was a very educational experience. The lovely guide took us a few thousand years back in time and showed the world as it could have been then. The exhibits are phenomenol. Do not miss this if you are in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TirelessHP
50,i loved it,wow. so educative. i cant believe they are searching fossils in the middle of LA. its nice aswell to walk in the park around. you dont really nedd to get in the museum and pay. so much to see around for free and your gonna learn many things. wow,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alysd2018
40,Remarkable museum,"A lot of prehistoric animals were mired in the tar pits, which are still active. You can see them all in various states of display, including an animatronic exhibit. Great for kids and enjoyable for adults.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CaTraveler7777
50,a must see!,"Fantastic experience, very educational. Would recommend it as a must see to the LA area. The outdoor exhibit is really well designed, as is the indoor museum. We enjoyed strolling through the grounds and learning about the history of the tar pits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gogi365
40,Interesting day out,"Didn't have time to go inside the museum, but the tar pits were really interesting to see. You can see archaeologists excavating there, there are bones sticking out. Really cool for an old dino nerd like me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tomH74792
50,Unique to Los Angeles,"This is a must see if you have children. Come see dinosaurs and the scientists who have discovered, cleaned and put all the bones together like huge jigsaw puzzles. My first visits were as a child on field trips. Every out-of-town guest gets a trip here. As you walk in, see the tar bubbling up from under the asphalt sidewalk. Then see the fence enclosed tar pit. It looks like a regular watering hole. You realize how the animals came to be stuck. Proceed to the museum for all the details. Depending on the children's ages and their interest, you may spend 30 minutes or over an hour. There is a movie, moving replicas and a fascinating glass enclosed lab. where the scientists work. If you have enough time, visit the working tar pit excavation a few meters away and pop inside the LACMA art museum. You can easily make a day of it. Parking is reasonable and before or after, visit near-by Farmer's Market for a meal. This is old Los Angeles!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jashas2014
40,Fascinating Ice Age History and Fossils!,"I had not been to this park and Museum since the late 1970's after it first opened and today my friend and I decided to go visit the Tar Pitts and see the Museum. This place is one of the most interesting places on the planet because there is no other asphalt pools in any other urban environment anywhere in the world that are still active. It's is called The La Brea Tar Pitts but the black crude that trapped thousands of ice age animals here is actually liquid asphalt. They have been excavating this site and extracting fossils from it for the last 100 years. The museum has an amazing collection of reticulated skeletons that consist of giant sloths, dire wolves, Ice Age horses, short faced bears, Columbian mammoths, and American Shasta mastodons. The specimens in the museum are absolutely beautiful and in perfect condition. It is amazing to see them. Parking in the parking lot is $12, and entry fees for adults are $12 as well. There is also a film currently playing at the museum, and it is an additional four dollars per person to see the film. The movie is about the area during the Ice Age that was between 10,000 and 40,000 years ago, when most of the fossils that are being excavated at the site were living creatures getting trapped in the asphalt. There is a free tour that takes you to watch some of the excavation work being done, and gives you a good look into a few of the asphalt pits. This is a museum that is very popular with children, so there will be occasional giggling, squealing, screaming, and rowdy kids running around you. Deal with it! If you visit the museum and the tar Pitts and see the amazing fossils you will begin to feel like a kid yourself. If you will be visiting Los Angeles and want to see some fascinating history up close and personal put this great natural phenomenon on your list of things to do. It is a great museum for children, and for the child in every adult.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rodvilencia
40,Archeology in the City,"We were waiting for a flight and decided to stop at the pits. The amount of animals (especially predators) extracted from the pits is amazing. It's a great short stop in middle of the city.The pits and grounds are free to view and you can watch live excavation teams working (in the summer).There is a charge for the museum. The museum is small but clean with lots of hands on exhibits.Parking is a $12 flat fee, however we found free street parking a block away, there's also metered street parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/herd_of_6
40,Last Minute Decision and Glad We Did,"Was in LA for an extended weekend and trying to fit in several things. La Brea was not initially on our list, but we decided to visit. Very interesting to see the larger pits and probably ever more so was the small random areas where the tar of coming thru the surface. What they have found and the way it is presented in the museum is worth the $12.If in the area definitely make the trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/687JamesD
40,Very Interesting Site,"The tar pits are pretty amazing. To realize these have been here for thousands of years and it is right in the middle of Los Angeles right near the Museum. It is a really nice way for everyone, young and old, to enjoy an afternoon walking the tar pits and the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/83deedeeu
50,Great Archaeological Museum,If you love Paleontology you'll love this active archeological museum. Amazing up close and personal tours daily. Los Angeles millions of years ago.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nickberd
50,Very Popular Venue for Tourists and Natives,Great atmosphere with pavilion buildings around lively courtyards. Very nice outdoor dining as part of newer addition.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hakccmd
40,Very cool/historic adventure,"The tar pits are pretty cool for folks that enjoy history and get a kick out of museums. This is a place where you can walk right up and experience history.You can actually see the air bubbles rising up through the tar and there are spots that allow you to get so close to the thar that you can touch it if you would like (I don't recomment it). Believe it or not, you will probably have some sort of tar stuck to your shoes when you leave. There was some sort of music festival onsight as well as there is a large park that's free to the public. Lots of art, food stops and a gift shop also.There was also a very enjoyable Guillermo Del Toro exhibit while we were there - OUTSTANDING.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/btbolt
50,Interesting for all Ages,"We came here with my two children, 8 and 11 and my neice 22. Everyone had a great time! The outdoor grounds which show the pits were a great place for the kids to work off some energy, while still stopping to see each display. The active excavation was most interesting. The museum was just the right size, and had friendly docents to explains different exhibits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VacationMom201
50,Fascinating,"Visited the La Brea tar pits and museum whilst on holiday.Its an amazing sight to see oily tar bubbling up to the surface with a smell of oil in the air.This sticky stuff trapped hundreds of animals that ventured into it.The surface of the tar pits at the time were covered in dust/leaves and some with a thin layer of water on top so the animals thought it was either solid ground or a lake to drink, once into the tar there was no escape.This led thousands of years later for archeologists to recover the bones of Mammoths/Saber tooted tigers etc.The museum contains full skeletons of mamoths/bears/horses/saber tooth tigers/wolfs plus lots of others etc etc etc all removed from the tar pits.Obviously the tar pits are fenced off but you can still get close to see the tar bubbling up.Amazing and definately worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/geoffd420
40,"Interesting, fun place for adults and grandchildren!","We took our grandchildren here on a Sunday afternoon. Parking lot was full, so parking was problematic. The museum is very interesting and educational with a gift shop that makes every child want to buy something! It's fun to see the glass enclosed lab with the researchers, with signs indicating what they are working to reconstruct. This is about the right size to bring young children- they can learn inside and run outside.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jmo173
50,Sadly fascinating!,"I was both fascinated and saddened by the exhibits here.Let me go back. We were up north for a short weekend getaway to visit an expo, and after realizing that the expo wasn't nearly large enough to take up two days worth of time, decided to make the most of our getaway to visit the Tar Pits, which have long been on our list.The exhibits are well-maintained, easy to understand, and full of information. They're also heart-breakingly sad, when you stop to consider how many animals lost their lives under your feet (or is that just me? I do tend to be a bleeding heart...)The biggest exhibit - the one that most people are at least vaguely aware of, even if they've never visited the site - is the outdoor one. The one that depicts the mama mammoth stuck in tar, trumpeting in fear as the papa and baby stand on the shore, beside themselves with fear and unable to help in any way. It's a depressing scene...and, as it turns out, completely incorrect.The plaque at the head of the exhibit breaks down what you're seeing, and all the inaccuracies they've uncovered over the years. Still, even if it is wrong, it's still incredibly sad. Yes, I KNOW they aren't real, and I KNOW they perished long, long ago, but to see that scene played out in front of you - while the pit bubbles and the mama mammoth sways in the tar - it just makes me want to cry.Yeah, it's totally just me.The museum itself is larger than it looks from the entrance. They have a great timeline that starts near the store, which gives an easy visual as to when certain species died out, and what they looked like when they roamed this Earth. The re-enactment depictions of some of the species and the environment as you get further into the museum are impressive, as well. There's a full mammoth skeleton, which makes me realize how tiny I am. There were plant fossils, seed fossils, and even a penis bone on display (and it was so difficult for the 12 year old boy inside me to refrain from taking a picture of that and sending it out to all my friends, but refrain I did...yay me!)There's a large wall that displays the upwards of 400 direwolf skulls that have been discovered on the site. Bird, saber tooth, mastadon, rodent...the fossils on display seemed never-ending.My favorite place within the museum, though, was the working lab. The day we were there, three women were working on sorting, cleaning and assembling fossils. The lady I spent way too much time staring at was putting together an ice-age wolf skull, and as I stood there, she found three matches, and was able to clean and assemble them! It was amazing to see the skull take even the tiniest shape under her skilled hands!The grounds of the complex are a lot bigger than I expected, and there's something to see almost at every turn. Project 23 was still an active working site, though they weren't digging or cataloging while we were there (it was a Sunday, after all).I would love to be able to come back to spend some time watching the dig, or seeing how far the employees in the museum have gotten assembling the bone fragments in their care.Yes, it's sad when you stop to think about the lives lost over the years. But pragmatically speaking, the amount of knowledge that has been unearthed on this site since the first fossil was discovered all those years ago has really helped science, dontchathink?Parking isn't free, and you should definitely get your tickets at the booth on the path outside - save yourself the time! I really want to take advantage of some of the tours the next time we visit, too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SimeyTravels
50,Better than expected,"We had planned a day on the coast between LA and SF including Hearst Castle but due to the fires on the coast and Big Sur had to replan our day. We ended up going to the La Brea Tar Pits and the Griffith Observatory, and I think in some ways this was better suited for our teenagers. Looking at the outdoor tar pits (which were oozing bubbles of tar) and an actual excavation in progress, was fascinating. The smell of tar permeates the air. The outdoor tar pits are well marked and have explanatory signs. Then we went into the museum which was small but well done and took about an hour. Note we were able to get in for a reciprocal membership from our home town science museum. The museum even had a list of restaurants within a few minutes walk which we went to. We spent about 2 hours and definitely worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/swansfromBoston
40,Place is the pits,They really have tar pits here. Black tar pits. Where do they come from? But they're there. There's other stuff there too... more like a museum...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/QZOCK
50,Amazing Experience,"The La Brea Tar Pits and Museum are an amazing trip back in time right in the heart of LA. The museum is full of actual fossils and skeletons recovered from the tar pits. Outside, you can see an active dig where they are uncovering new bones every day. I really liked the pond because it was bubbling due to the tar underneath it. That was impressive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lizh948
40,History,A great place for children and adults too I suppose . Tar coming up to the surface and stories of animals caught into it in acient times. The smell of tar is all over the place too. A nice park for families to wander about and a small museum with some souvenirs.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Yoy555
40,very interesting,"my wife and I stopped by and did this tour while waiting for a wedding reception later that night. It was very interesting and they have fossil evidence that man overlapped the times with the mammoths, early horses etc. Well worth the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rodneyj339
40,Interesting Place to see,"I liked seeing the tar pits and leaning about them. Parking was a pain, we got a parking ticket, but overall worth seeing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JAT109

40,Interesting History,"If you're into history, this is an interesting place to visit. It's kind of a living exhibit, as the tar pits are still there and active. We walked the park and visited the outside exhibits, reading all of the signs along the way. That part is free. If you want, you can pay to go inside the museum. We didn't. We felt like we got enough information walking around outside. Obviously, the outdoor stuff wouldn't be great on a rainy day, but the museum could be. I believe there is also a theater inside that shows movies.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scturner2016

50,Great place to learn about fossils!,"We took our daughter 20 years ago, it's about twice the size now.We took our 6 yr old grandson, and he had to walk around the museum twice! The 3D movie was great. Great family experience and educational at the same time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/judis255
40,Nice place to visit,"If you're looking for a nice place to visit, that's pretty quick, and you get to experience a bit of history, this is the place for you. Before you get there, try to find parking on the street because the lot will cost $12 and just take a walk around outside because you will be charged $12 pp if you enter this small museum with a ton of dire wolves. From what I heard from another patron, the exhibits haven't changed since the 70s, but for a first timer, it's small but pretty cool. After you visit the museum, take a stroll outside and see the bubbly tar pits outside. There isn't much to see but you wonder what lies beneath you and in the bubbly tar.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/536christyg
50,Cool family activity,"My family loved this place. You can not only walk around the tar pits, but also go to several excavation sites pretty much every day of the week and watch them pull 'stuff' out, clean it and inventory it. The inside museum is small-but excellent. Some really great, easy to read information and very cool displays. They even have a glass front lab, so you can watch the people through many steps of cleaning, inventory, piecing together fragments and identifying what they have discovered. It was so cool to watch one person spend so much time on several bone pieces, like a jigsaw puzzle-and her excitement at figuring out how they went together-and being able to identify it! It was exciting and fascinating watching her.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BenayK1

There are several pits in the park and an on-going dig site that you can see for free. The museum isn't very big and features a few larger animal skeletons and many smaller animal skulls, etc. Great park for a picnic and close to the art museum, which offers statues to enjoy outside.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/socali123

I assumed the bubbling was from heat, but it turns out that is is methane gas being released from the oil that is underground. Very interesting excavations going on, and you can see the scientists and volunteers (through glass) working on freeing fossilized animals who got rapped in the muck a long time ago. Very interesting, for all ages, and worth the trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BelleBHouston_Texas

Now they have a museum which encloses most of the pits, although you can walk in the park which is really nice and see ""archeological"" digs. The problem is that I could not get the fake Disney digs of Disney World out of my head and wondered if these were real. The pond which still has tar boiling up as well as a few other sites are pretty cool to see. I would recommend a tour especially for kids and even my 19 year old was interested.

And walking between, there were lots of Pokemons to be found as well.The 3D movie is well worth the extra $4 and explains how the Tar Pits evolved and to this day still yield artifacts and bones going back more than 30,000 years. Entry fees reasonable.

The display is simple and the signs are very informative.Now get ready, step into the museum and see the incredible work of the staff and miners of the bones. They have recovered and reassembled incredible creatures from our past. Right in down town LA a treasure trove of history was hiding in almost plain sight. The discovery of this gem and the digs that surround the grounds is way beyond amazing.The museum is spacious and to sit and stare at the bones assembled and revel in the work that has been done by people with more patience than can be measured.Buy the annual pass that gets you into three museums for a year and come again and again.WOW!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CharleySays
40,"Terrific exhibit of fossils and ongoing excavation, great history lesson!",Spectacular exhibits and great tours. Only confusing thing was lack of info on various tours & times. Definitely worth the price of admission!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/565nd
30,Average,"I was looking forward to seeing the pits and when you walk in, you are drawn to a fenced off area where you can see it bubbling away and smell the tar. Just what I was looking for ... however, from this point onwards, I was a bit underwhelmed.You see other smaller pits and pay to go around the museum, which is interesting - but not overly. 3/5 is a bit harsh but 4/5 would be too much for me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H9412VIsteves
50,You'll get stuck here! No! It's a good thing!,"Long ago, creatures like the Mammoth, Dire Wolf and Saber Tooth cat became mired in the sticky black tars of La Brea on Wilshire Boulevard. We traveled here and also became trapped by the interesting attraction of the La Brea Museum and Tar Pits! The staff of the Museum was attentive, friendly and informative. Walking about the grounds doesn't cost a cent, but by all means do help them continue their research and pop for admission. Fascinating dioramas, timelines that are very well done and a super rendition of the history of La Brea. One of our favorite interactives was the display that allowed you to try to pull a rod out of the tar. No wonder the poor creatures became stuck! You CAN'T do it, and neither could they. A nice walk down Wilshire Boulevard; we parked in the Petersen Automotive Museum lot for our morning visit there and walked the blocks past the Los Angeles County Museum of Art to La Brea. It's the Museum Row on Miracle Mile. We'll go back in 2017 for the new (and it looks to be BIG) Academy Museum of Motion Pictures; the Oscar Museum! It's all the best. So much of what you have to see in LA and environs means driving, driving, driving. But here on the Mile, you can see lots of good stuff for a walk on Wilshire. Super Travel Hint: Make time for lunch at Delishs, a little deli located in the City National Building, corner of Fairfax and Wilshire over the crosswalk next to the Petersen Auto Museum. It doesn't look like there is one there, but the friendly guard inside the door will direct you to the little delicatessen located within. The Petersen Museum security guard gave us this hint. You'll eat well, won't pay an arm and a leg, and will feel like a native Los Angelean. (Is that a word?) One last cool fact; in the 44,000 year history researched to date at La Brea, only one human had the misfortune of being interred in the tars. Bottom Line: La Brea is completely captivating and deserves your consideration. My bet is that kids would love it here, although we had none with us on our visit. Lastly, the gift shop is loaded with fun and cool stuff and you'll be guaranteed to get a chuckle out of some of the wares!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tom_TopCat
30,boring and in need of an update,"I was looking forward to seeing this while on vacation in LA. I love History and anything interesting but I was disappointed by the simplicity of this place. We walked the entire property as we read the placards about the various pits. Some of the pits were closed for some reason and the ones that were open just didnt excite. The one cool part was an old man who wandered out of somewhere and began explaining to us about one of the displays. More interaction of this type and other ideas would help. Overall, the exhibit is interesting but this place could be so much more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ass0ciateds
40,Interesting,Found these very interesting and was taken by a family friend to see the Tar pits. Interesting see the tar bubbling up.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/UkManchestergirl
30,"Great for Kids, Smelly, Bones!","We went back to the Tar Pits. I had been once a long time ago. I realized that not much had changed. There is a museum with some bones . There is a tour that you have to get tickets to, but then everyone else gets to join anyway. Then you see a pit with more bones. And there is lots of tar pits, many with bubbles. If you go once, you probably won't go back soon. If you have never been, it is a don't miss. Kids were loving it! I like the LACMA next door.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LAtoEverywhere
50,Incredible insight into the past,"I loved this area. Wasnt sure what to expect, but the Pits, Museum displays & video were very informative and well worth seeing. Unbelievable how many fossils are continuing to be unearthed in the Tar Pits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sharonwE5646JT

50,Fun with archeology,La Brea Tar Pits is a fun take on an archeological museum. The museum features thousands of artifacts/bones from ancient animals that roamed the earth before humans arrived. It fun to see dinosaurs and other ancient animal species that we have only heard about in movies or documentaries. This museum is in a great location in terms of the beautiful landscape and park area surrounding it and also its close proximity to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and a buch of decent food trucks across the street. You can enjoy the beautifully landscaped park area and see some sculptures of these ancient creatures with written histories behind them outside for free or you can pay the $30? for admission to the thousands of fossil bones inside. Either way its very nice. The only sad thing is knowing that this museum was made possible by the bones gathered from these ancient animals that died because they could not free themselves from their feet being stuck in the tar pits. Just try not to let the kids focus on that and they will love it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BargainHunter247
40,Surprising place to visit in LA,"You need a bit of time to get to it wherever you are staying in LA, but its a surprising place to visit, need time for walking around the tar pits and the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TeamWard
50,Another great family attarction,"Loved the museum and the tour guides were really helpful and knowledgeable. Great for kids of all ages, good interactive exhibits, but as some of the stuff is outside think about the weather, it was a very hot day when we wNt!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/306mirandam
30,Delightful Historical Place,"Parking is difficult if you get here on a weekend after 12pm. Try parking at SAG plaza across the street or at Peterson's Car Museum.Museum itself is small, but interesting. It holds the attention of young and old with all the different animals. It also has hands on exhibit that shows how hard it was to get out of the tar. Be sure to visit the laboratory and the excavation 91 sight.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karynb627
40,interesting,interesting place to visit.......the pits themselves are ok but the museum is great..great displays and with further discoveries can only get better....next door to the LACMA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/988mathewm
50,Love This Place!,I find this museum a natural wonder! To see the oil naturally escaping from the reservoirs below - is so cool! I'm a science geek and the tar pits and all of the exhibits are truly amazing!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/196susannel
50,Short and sweet.,"A smallish museum with a big story to tell. A must visit for dinosaurphiles. A neat history with real ""tar"" (really asphalt) bubbling up from the group to this day. Active digging happening here right now.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FloridaFamilyofFive
50,"A Sticky, Black, Gooey Death Trap","I'll wager you never saw a real tar pit? Not the Uncle Remus type but a real death trap. And it's in Los Angeles. It's called the La Brea Tar Pits and Museum and it's located in Hancock Park, just off Wiltshire Boulevard.Hancock Park is a small, lovely little park that you can wander around and actually see some of the tar pits and ongoing excavations for free. As you walk around you can see, behind the fencing the bubbling tar pits and smell the unique aroma of liquid tar in the air. You might also be able to see some actual excavations being worked on in real time by their on site scientific staff.But the real excitement is located inside the George C. Page Museum building. The museum is the center of activity at La Brea. After a fossil is discovered and excavated in one of the tar pits, it is brought to the glass walled Fossil Lab where you can see a team of paleontologists working on the specimens.The museum currently boasts over 1 million ice age fossils, from 650 species and go from a Colombian mammoth tusk to the tooth of a baby mouse. You will find bison, camels, condors, dire wolfs, ma moths, ground sloths and saber tooth cats.The highlights of the museum are the 2 specially commissioned shows: The Ice Age Encounter Multimedia Stage Show and Titans of the Ice Age which is a beautifully written 3D movie. They are priced as an addition to the entry fee however, if this might be your only visit to the La Brea Tar Pits, these shows are well worth the money.All in all this is a great experience for both children and adults. If you have a few hours available, this is a surprising visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MartinT170
40,Museum closed? Still worth a visit,"Los Angeles is full of iconic places to visit that are in the To Do list of every visitor , La Brea tar pits is not, and should .... For those people that enjoy history, well....pre-historic that is ..... At the time of my arrival the museum was already closed, but I was able to wonder the space and stand in front of a gated tar pit , bubbling , stopping and then another bubbling episode a few feet away. You see this and don't know what it is and probably think ... Why they don't cover this yucky space ? That is when knowledge captures your attention . Asphalt floating in water appears to be brewing because of methane gas escaping ( allegedly the burps of bacteria underground) , this tar could easily trap an animal that made him prey to another , that in turn made him prey to another and hence the best collector of ice age life that is still being discovered. I can't wait to stop by again and hopefully get the full experience.....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MiamiMinime
50,History at your fingertips,The amazing smells and sites of an active prehistoric dig was awe inspiring. To see the prehistoric finds and see the tar pits in action is worth the trip. It is a beautiful outdoor space and you don't have to pay unless you go into the museum. However the museum is a must.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SPT16
40,A park with some interesting facts,"I went literally for a walk in the park, I didn't have the chance to visit the museum, so I will review only the park. Nice and secure place to walk, to rest, and additionally to learn some very interesting facts about the fossil excavation site that the park really is.Cool place to visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K8047NGdanielc
50,Great!,"I have 2 kids - 6 & 8 , obsessed with fossils - etc. Tar pits are a fun way to show kids what life was like during the ice age. They got to see the bubbling tar, feel a saber tooth tiger .. Tooth. They loved it. Only need a few hours",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lorias2016
40,Natural history epicenter.,"Okay, I have to admit that I've wanted to visit here since I was in 4th grade, so my opinion may be a bit skewed, but I enjoyed the visit. Was the museum worth the admission price? Hmm, only if you are nerd. If you take the time to read the information about what the Tar Pits are all about,yes, but if reading about stuff ain't your thing, don't bother. I loved the Dire Wolf display - very impressive. The actual Tar Pits are free to view, but unless you understand what you are seeing via the museum, it won't make much of an impact.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Runnerjb
30,Expensive Bathroom Break!,We decided to stop by and see this attraction and we also had to use the bathroom since we had been site seeing. It was $12 to park. If you are into excavating and pre-historic stuff then you might like this place. This was not our kinda place but to each their own. We did walk around but did not go in the museum. We were there about 15min.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mickey0672
50,Interesting and engaging,We had all seen documentaries about La Brea and our visit did not disappoint. Lovely park with pits fenced off for safe viewing. Nice museum with interesting exhibits and presentations. 3D movie was excellent. Our 8-year-old loved this place and we adults enjoyed it too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KingsvilleMom
40,"Very interesting, outside part is free!","Museum was about 25 bucks for both, very interesting if you have time to spend at least an hour. Outside tar pits are not a whole lot to see but are free and educational for kids. One of them has a person there to ask questions and she was very helpful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B7602CVchrisc
50,Wow,Totally amazing. Film awesome. Presentation was so professionally done. Granddaughters loved it. I did too and it was my second time. First was 15 years ago with my oldest granddaughter when she was 8!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/granniedish
50,Ice Age Hair Ball Fundraiser,This once-a-year fundraiser at the La Brea Tar Pits encourages guests to arrange their hair in a wooley mammoth style or any other fun do. Guests could browse the museum's exhibits and watch the current movie before they went outside to sample the appetizers & desserts and danced to the music under the stars.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/U6642MIkathyw
40,A Pre-historic Gem in an Urban Environment,"The La Brea Tar Pits and Museum is a fun stop for those interested in the pre-historic days of LA. The large tar pit with small bubbling areas is fenced in however, tar areas can be found through out public grounds where the museum is located. The museum is small with some good pre-historic artifacts and exhibits, fossil lab, outside atrium, theater and gift shop.If going to the Natural History of LA County, I recommend going to the LA Brea Tar Pits first if it is on your agenda(the museums offer a combo ticket). If you only have time to visit one, the Natural History Museum has much larger dinosaur displays. I also suggest street coin meter parking (we found parking on the street behind the museum) instead of the $12 museum parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shewoo
40,Get away from the big parks and see the real monsters of LA,"The museum is showing its age (animated features look pretty cheesy now), but these fossils are the real deal. Excellent on-site volunteer and professional interpreters. Good science education and entertainment will keep you busy for a couple of hours. We didn't see the 3D movie.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gaelharp
50,Fabulous for those with an interest in fossils and ice age dino's!,Great place to visit with the kids. The museum was very cool with lots of exhibits and skeletons to look at. We watched the 3D short film about the tar pits and the animals of the ice age era and we also enjoyed the interactive show with live sabre-toothed tiger. The tar pits were very interesting and lots of things to read and enjoy. Great for those of all ages but especially if you have young children.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lesoley333
40,Interesting place.,This was on the list for the vacation and we did enjoy it. I have to say though you could really skip the museum part and just go around to everything outside for free. I would recommend making a donation but the inside isn't too exciting but the price isn't very high. Make sure you go earlier in the day as a great deal of the outside pit viewing areas were locked at 5.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jinxkmdh
50,Small but very enjoyable and informative Museum,"I had never been to LA, but as a child, I had always remembered the La Brea tar pits. So as my wife shopped, I knew I could quickly slip down Wilshire to see this and it was a treat. The museum was great at showing the animals found in the various pits and the way they would have lived. While small it did pack in a lot of information about the natural asphalt seeps from the oil. One of my favorite parts was the tar pull where two objects with different diameters are place in the tar and you have to pull them out. The 2"" diameter was nothing to pull out. However the 5"" diameter was almost impossible with all my strength. It really illustrated how an animal could get stuck. The wildest part is the 400 Dire Wolf skulls on display that were found in one pit.In addition, the architecture of the museum is very interesting and unique. You can free walk around the top and get good views of the park as well as the Jurassic garden in the court yard. If you pay to go in the museum, you can stroll thought the interior courtyard garden. All of it was great and well worth the fee.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GroverR
50,Fun with Family - A must for anyone that Likes Dinosaurs,"We spent a few hours here and had a blast. It is one of the largest collection of Ice Age fossiles. The museum can be seen in 1/2 hour and contains great complete dinosaur fossils(Mammoth, Sabre Tooth Tiger, Dire Wolf etc). There are a great group of workers that can help with any questions. The Tar Pits are interesting and have ongoing pits to review. It is on museum row so spend a few hours here and then the LA County of Art next door.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J0hnPM10
50,Well worth the visit,"Our visit here was a last minute decision on driving past to another museum and we're so glad we stopped.You can view the tar pits for free and if you wish, pay the admission to the museum. This was fascinating with plenty of staff on hand to answer questions. The information boards inside are very well put together and the exhibits are well displayed. Overall it's a fascinating spot. Allow 1-1.5 hours. There's a great coffee stop in the adjacent art museum (5 mins walk).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Telgip
50,Worth the effort.,It took a bit of effort to make the drive as the traffic and parking around the area is quite hectic even in mid week. Make sure you make a reserve ticket purchase as the Tar Pit parking is limited. The grounds are shared with the Los Angles Art Museum. The staff is knowledgeable and friendly. I could have spent some additional time reading more but the 2 children we had 8 & 6 were ready to go after an hour.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JRJLasVegas_Nevada
40,Cool place to check-out while in LA,"I visited the tar pits with a couple of friends for the first time. There's a large tar pit right in the middle of the park which was cool to see. There were also multiple small tar pits scattered through out the park with outdoor exhibits and an indoor museum. We bought tickets to look around the main exhibits of the museum, it showed a lot of the fossils and bones recovered from the pits over the years- pretty cool.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/U1853YOsaraha
40,Quick Science-History Visit with Kids,This is a must see while in LA. Although the park is small it makes up in the fun and interesting scientific and historical significance. Active digs and museum can be an eye opener for kids on how our earth keeps surprising us every day. The constant bubbling is amazing considering it's thousands or millions of years old. An hour or 2 is all you need as part of an afternoon in the area or LACMA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/walshlizzie
50,Fun and Educational!,"The kids enjoyed learning about these dinosaurs, but didn't much care for the smell of the tar outside :) I found it wonderfully educational, and fascinating to see the tar still bubbling up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SudsTraveler
20,Disappointing!,"I worked in LA in the early seventies and used to drive past the Tar Pits daily. Never got a chance to go there until a few weeks ago. But it might be another 40 years before I go back, I should have gone somewhere else, most interesting part was the lake out the front that bubbles sulfur constantly (you don't have to pay to see the lake).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RussellB492

50,School Field Trip,"Loved it! It's a little small, but they have some interesting things on exhibit. As part of our field trip, we attended the Titans of the Ice Age movie, but were unable to see the observation pit due to it being booked. Great place for children interested in the Ice Age. It also has some outdoor sights and plenty of room for children to run around or to have a picnic. Plus it is right next to LACMA if you want to stop by.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jcovarrubias

50,Paleontology in downtown LA!,"This was a big surprise for me as a visitor and my friend who is native to LA. We both learned a lot, not just about the tar pits and fossils that have and continue to come out of it but also the surrounding land and it's history. The museum is worth the price of entry. It's not huge but very well laid out and the many of the exhibits really give you an idea of what is ongoing there in fossil discovery. You can even watch staff at work cleaning and categorizing the fossils.Tar pits outside are not quite what I expected - more like dirty ponds that bubble, but it's a nice park to wander around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JPVM13
50,Ice Age in the Heart of LA,"This time capsule lies right in the middle of LA. There are some parking meters around the site for $1/hr as well as an on site parking lot for a larger fee. You can roam the park and see the tar pits without a fee, but if you would like to get in and see the museum there is a fee. It was about $15/person for entry and the 3D movie that runs about 30 minutes. There are fossils throughout the museum and a tranquil garden in the center of the museum. Overall, its a good way to spend a few hours on a hot afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cs51516
40,Way better than expected-kids loved seeing science in action!,"Having heard about this marvel for years, we were excited to see itParking was $12, and with the PokemonGo craze, they are making oodles and scads of money on parking alone gathering in the trainers!Pay the little bit extra on admission to get the 3D movie about the Ice Age. It was worthwhile. We heard we should have purchased the excavator tour as well but it was too late-so your call.The preservation level of the fossils is unreal. But the really cool part is watching volunteers and paleontologists at work. Science in action. There's even a part of the exhibit where you can try to pull a metal rod out of the tar, which demonstrates how these animals got mired in so deeply. The active sites are amazing.Great place to spend 2-3 hours and get the kids invested in actual science.Only beef was the crap in the movie about how humans ruin the world-I expect a progressive agenda in California, but it was really heavy-handed. Just FYI.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/633leighb
50,Best time during our 2 day trip,2 hours is enough to get through the museum and see the movie. My kids enjoyed the museum but the absolute best part was getting lunch from the food trucks across the street and picnicking in the park area.There were lots of kids playing and my 6 year old son took the lead in encouraging the others to roll down the hills... lots of fun and easy going environment. There are also random areas where tar is popping up through the ground. My kids enjoyed poking it with sticks.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GAkimberlyPEACH
50,Fun for the family.,Get place to take the family. Lots to see and very interesting. Take lunch and eat at the park next to the attraction.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/m0m24ca
50,Happy we went.,"Totally worth seeing. We got there around 4:00-about an hour before closing, but the staff member at the ticket booth assured us that would be enough time to see the main museum. We did not, however, have enough time to see the outlying Observation Pit and ongoing excavation at Project 23 and Pit 91 since they close at 5:00 as well. The rest of the grounds you can walk around after the museum has closed and view the fenced off tar pits. I would recommend getting there by 3:00 at the latest so you can see everything.It's not a large area, but the sheer number of fossils they have pulled from the pits--and continue to pull out-- is amazing. Very impressed that the fossils you see on display aren't replicas and are the real deal. I think the boys' favorite things were the large dire wolf skull display and the tar pull near the entrance to the museum. It gives you an idea of how these unfortunate animals got stuck in the first place. This is definitely a must if you have kids that are into fossils and/or nature.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ESS_lover

30,Museum is good for young children.,We are a family of four with teenagers so the museum was a bit boring to them but the tar pits were interesting to see.

50,Go there and get stuck in!,"A fabulous place to spend an hour or a day, it is worth investing in an inclusive ticket for the shows and talks. Do visit the actual excavations and poke a stick in the ""tar"" oozing out of the ground. There is plenty of room for picnics and children to run around as well as lots of great interactive learning- this 50yr old child had a blast!! There are close local supermarkets and cafes, plus many other museums.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MFW53
50,Wow... Fantastic,Loved this place. One of my bucket list places to be and do. So much knowledge and history to absorb. And the arboretum on top was peaceful.

Like all museums in USA, it is very professional, educational and in this case convenient. Its all about evolution with woolly mamoths, saber tooth tigers and more. Entrance is nominal and there is a free tour available. You can bus it from down town LA or Santa Monica. Dont forget you camera. Great for kids older than 8 years.

40,"Summer afternoon with 2 little boys, gramma and mamma","I hadn't been to La Brea Tar pits in LA since I took my kids 30 years ago, and then prior to that when I went on an elementary school field trip in the 70's. I am so happy we went. My grandsons, ages 6 and 4 LOVED it. We bought the ticket to the museum with the movie and were very impressed. The movie kept the kids attention and ours with interesting scientific and historical information. The museum displays were attractive to the boys and they were able to move from exhibit to exhibit at their own pace. The most fascinating fact for me was that the tar is still bubbling from the ground right in the middle of Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KimBenTravelin
50,Stunning prehistory right in LA,"The most exciting part of my visit to LA was to have my six-year old grandson proudly show me round the Tar Pits Museum. He stunned me with his knowledge, including the long complicated names of so many of the extinct species. It's a must to visit if you're in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/U3925MTmichaele
40,"A little dated, but a good effort and a couple of good hours.","Probably great for kids, and probably mandatory for anyone science oriented, but when you get down to it, it's a tar pit (or as you will be educated an asphalt seep). The museum is pretty good, and the 3D movie worth seeing. The other presentation, basically a giant puppet show explaining the site, is just for kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rigel54
30,"Small, and the free bits are the most interesting","Student admission was only $9 so in that regard the museum wasn't *bad* value, but nevertheless was very small.

50,A Nice Surprise,"We did not have this on our list, but came upon it and so we decided to stop! It was very interesting! The people working there are very friendly & helpful! Our girls found it very interesting and to be real honest they weren't excited about it, but leaving they were both glad we stopped. It was a good learning experience. A great added plus...teachers get in free! So that was a great plus for us as we were not expecting that!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/familyoffourkansas
50,Teens and young and old children loveeee!!,"Wow! My husband and I wanted to go here and we didn't know how the kids would feel (4 and 16), but we all loved it! Get the pass to the measuring and both shows. The saber show was phenomenal! The woman who does the show is amazing! We loved our trip here, and will go again next time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O8965XNmichellem
40,Unreal,Wear your walking shoes and prepare to feel like a kid. Live out your fantasy of digging for dinosaurs or watch the pros do it! It is a tar pit so be prepared for it to be smelly but venture through the entire park so you don't miss anything!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/610katherined
50,Very interesting! Loved it,"Visited La Brea Tar Pits on our last day of a ten day trip to LA. This is where asphalt is bubbling up from the ground and millions of animals were fossilized when they got stuck in the tar. At present they have found over 5 million fossils. Plan to spend a few hours there. You can feel what it's like to try to get out of the tar. We joined a couple different meet up tours to hear about the tar pits because we knew nothing when we got there. That was very helpful. Look at the schedule on line before you go so you'll have an idea of what time they start. We also saw the film which helped to understand what happened and what we would see at the Tar pits. You can actually see the asphalt bubbling up from underground. It looks fake, but it's presently bubbling and visible. They have ongoing excavations going on and you can watch them at work. The neighboring Los Angeles County Museum of Art was building a parking structure and unearthed 23 large crates worth of fossils of animals that had been stuck in the tar that they are working on now. You can also view the people in the lab working with microscopes and view what they Are seeing in their microscopes. I Loved it. My 11 year old son did as well, but my 13 year old son and 16 year old daughter did not like it as much. There are food trucks nearby on Wilshire across from the LACMA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A2772BZsallyb
50,Really enjoyed with my teen sons!,Pretty amazing place that many locals didn't even know about. We really enjoyed the museum and wandering the yard to see the tar pits. It's really an amazing place. Be sure to watch the movie to really understand what it is.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/catfishchav
40,Where are the mammoths in the Tar Pit,"You should put a better picture of the Tar Pits - the front of the museum with the mammoths in the Tar Pit.-A little dark inside, could use more light.-Be careful of not leaving anything, even in your trunk. Per the police, lots of tourist car break-ins, but with no damage to the cars.-Visit other museums in the area.-Good for rainy days. But you must drive by the front of the museum to perhaps just take a picture because there is so much to do in LA. Only go here is you have extra time or just like Museums.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Navigate00230422899
30,Kind of disappointing.,"The grounds are amazing - connected to LACMA. Tons of grass for running around.The inside is relatively small. My son (4 years) was scared of the mechanical saber tooth and wooly mammoth. The information was good but not enough to spend an afternoon there.It's worth a trip but we only went once and that was enough which is too bad since we love the national geographic channel, planet earth etc. LACMA and the Zoo were both more popular destinations for our family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Culinary-widow
50,Great museum for kids!,I went with family a few times in the past to this museum. I love the presentations and interactive attractions. This is the perfect place to bring children and students!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelRobs
40,Just HAD to Visit This Place When We Were in LA,"With GPS, I had no problem getting to this place since this was my first LA trip.Parking looked adequate and understandably it is not free.Tickets can be purchased outside but I thought they were a bit (just a bit) slow.We watched a 3D movie about the Ice Age and I'd recommend it.The exhibit of reconstructed beasts is quite impressive but I had hoped for more complete skeletons. There is plenty of room to see what is there...and to add more.We did not care for checking out actual tar pits. There are a few accessible but obviously gated!There appeared to be an actual paleontologist around to take questions from visitors but someone had A LOT of questions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/billcC5835GZ
40,Surprise Gem!,"For years I have passed the La Brea Tar Pits and thought that it was the sum of what I saw as I drove by, but it is so much more. I went with friends who came from NJ and wanted to check them out and I am so glad I went along. I don't want to spoil the experience for others, just to say this is good for young and old.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelSecrets78
50,Interesting!,Great to place to visit!... pity the petrol chemical smells. The exhibition space is really good. Going into the geology of the LA basin. Lots of fossils including sabre-tooth cat and mammoth. Theres a glassed area with the fossils being cleaned.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mikeadey72
40,Interesting,We didn't have much time but enjoyed it. Very interesting with great staff. Lots for the kids to see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BruceR978
50,The Mecca of my childhood is not a disappointment!,"The La Brea Tar Pits and the Page Museum are very much worth a visit during time spent in Los Angeles, especially if there are children in your group or if you're interested in paleontology and natural history in general, or Cenozoic animal life in particular.The tar pits are still bubbling away, and you will see big spurts of gas forming ripple effects in the thick, viscous tar no matter what time of day you visit the site. There are active excavations in progress in one area -- not obvious, but you can walk along pathways to it and see the grimy site of active work.But more appealing is the museum which houses numerous complete skeletons that have been excavated on the site -- sabre-tooth tigers, mastodons, dire wolves, various birds, and some extinct North American animals such as horses that pre-date the Europeanization of the Americas...even a type of camel. The exhibits are very nicely done, with good information posted. There is an animated tableau with an animated, life-size sabre-tooth tiger attacking a ground sloth. Another exhibit, which you peer at through glass, shows a saber-toothed tiger skeleton (an actual one) which morphs into a fleshed-out (holographic?) image of what the animal looked like when it was alive. Very cool to see. There is a big wall illustrating the timeline of evolution, and another showing where mankind was at various points during the development of the world. Creationists will not like this place!! :)A great feature is the glass-walled laboratory, where you can watch scientists and volunteers actively working on fragments (sometimes fairly large ones) of bones excavated from the pits. Often signs are posted in front of their work-stations so you can learn what it is that they're working on.The museum takes only an hour or so to see everything, including a short film. The gift shop is fun to peruse, packed with items sure to please kids of all ages. I read about this place all through my paleontology-fascinated childhood back in New England, and it was the very first place I visited when I moved to Los Angeles later in life. I was not disappointed, and I still take friends and family there every time they visit L.A.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O6793YDcherylm
50,Take Your Time,"There is a lot of interesting information in the La Brea Museum. Yes, you can go to the Tar Pits for free, but the museum is worth paying for admission to see. We didn't have a lot of time, but we were able to see the inside displays and the Tar Pits, which were very interesting. If you pay for the museum entrance, you can also take a guided tour of the Tar Pits, which we weren't able to do. I hope to go back again and take the tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Buffy24
40,Nothing like Tar,"You may of read about it , even seen pictures of it but really it's kinda one of those LA things you have to see and check out. It's really tar and it's right in the city doing its thing. Plan it in with a drive and it makes it all worth the while. A good attraction to cross off the list but worthy of making the list",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G3452WGdavidt
10,Check website for closures!,We were totally bummed to find this museum closed on July 4 even though their website said it would be open!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LBSanFran
50,Enjoyed Museum,"Very interesting museum, I enjoyed walking around the grounds and looking at the different areas were ""Tar"" was coming out of the ground. I did see a lot of people introduced trash and sticks where people poked and left sticks in the tar areas. Some people just can't leave well enough alone. Would like to see the trash picked out.Didn't take away from my visit, just an observation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Clight385
30,Interesting But Not a Lot to See,"My five year old daughter and I went here yesterday. It's fairly close to our house and we are members (Natural History Museum which also allows entrance to this museum) so thought it would be a good way to spend a few hours.Also the subject matter was interesting, there is not a lot to see. You can walk through the entire museum in less than an hour. Actually, the staff at the ticket booth told us as much because the tickets we received for the 3D movie started in an hour.The 3D movie was good and at 25 minutes long, about the right length. The museum is located within a great park that also houses the Los Angeles County of Art so can spend additional time walking the grounds or some of the outdoor exhibits/sculptures at LACMA without having to pay another admission.If you're interested in learning more about the tar pits, I certainly would not discourage a visit, just want to manage expectations appropriately. We will like go back only when they have a special exhibit/movie planned.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hoonieskang
40,Glad it was free!,"My husband had wanted to go to this attraction since he missed out on a trip to Los Angeles as a child. When we realized that we were not going to be there when the museum was open, we decided to walk by. To our surprise, not only could you see the pits from the street but the park is open until late. After walking through and seeing the different pits, my husband commented that although he enjoyed seeing the pits, his parents had made the right decision by not paying for admission on the childhood trip! The pits are from excavation and are not natural! Although he is interested in geology, etc., he also commented that in his opinion skipping the museum wasn't a big deal unless you are a 10-year old boy fascinated by dinosaurs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eeplebneesta
40,childhood dream come true,"I have wanted to visit the tar pits since I first heard about them as a child. So fun to bring my own kids and see this bit of the past smack dab in the middle of the city.Fascinating to see the pits, the current excavation, and everything that has been found over the years.Definitely worth the visit for anyone interested in natural history!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/samanthars

50,Very Interesting and Informative,"Our family spent a morning at the La Brea Tar Pits and had a great time. We had no idea what to expect and we learned a lot. The goo oozes through the ground all over, some not contained except by an orange traffic cone. The museum was very informative and we enjoyed the lovely atrium in the middle. Worth a visit for anyone and everyone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/agilityaddict

50,Great place to visit with your kids!,"We took our older son here when he was a toddler about 18 years ago so we thought we'd bring him and his younger brother again on our 1-day visit to LA. This place is a lot bigger than I remembered it. My son liked the small patches of tar on the fields and walkways as much as the actual pits (they bubble too!). We really enjoyed the museum where they display the fossils excavated from the tar pits. There is also an area where you can watch people work on the fossils. Since we have a family membership to our local science center, we were able to get into the museum free. Street parking was easy to get on the Wednesday we were there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tofurry
50,very educational and out of this world,this place has lots of interesting attractions like the tar pits and fossils found underneath them. very educational and fun for all ages.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlennSutrisno
40,Good Day out,"This is a very interesting place to visit. To see all the pits and also see the fossils which can been discovered there! Lots of fossils such as mammoth, saber-toothed tiger and so many more! Outside the museum, you have a large park to explore which features a number of smaller pits. There is also a little place in which you can see an open pit they are currently working on! Only complaint is the '3D' movie is a joke! 3D effect does not work and makes you sick! Needs improving badly! Everything else is good!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/XStark1ll3rX
50,Look out for the bubbling goo!,"Until I visited the tar pits, I had no idea what they really were. The area is located in the heart of Los Angeles, on Wilshire Blvd. There are quite a few tar pits, one large and many smaller ones. There is an active dig going on in one of the pits. Project 23, as I recall. Also located on the property is a beautiful museum displaying thousands of fossils found in the pits surrounding it. Quite a different experience. I recommend it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davec110
50,A highlight of LA for me,I love this kind of thing and had always wanted to see these tar pits and they did not disappoint. You can see them working on the fossils behind glass which is really cool and see where they are excavating right out of the ground.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E5891
50,Very interesting - our second time there,"We visited the La Brea Tar Pits way back in 1991. It is still worth a visit, as it is just so interesting. The 3D movie is brilliant, and shows the complete history and why everything is the way it is there. Very educational. I recommend this attraction to anyone interested in the excavation of the fossils, and the unfortunate extinction of many species. The smell of the tar in the tar pit outside the museum seems much stronger than I remember it 25 years ago.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/248grega

40,"Informative, interesting, relaxing","There is a pay parking lot for this place, but you can also find free street parking along the perimeter or within easy walking distance.The park itself is free and quite peaceful, but also has a lot of interesting information around the various tar pit spots. But to really get the full benefit, you need to cough up the $12 admission fee to the museum. While it is not huge, you can easily spend an hour or two inside seeing the tons of excavated skeletons. You will really enjoy the various full size large animals that have been reassembled. There also is a short movie, and an area where you can watch the researchers cleaning bones, etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dougmendoza
50,Unique place. Most certainly worth a visit,"Fascinating place. Unique view of the ice age animals. Amazingly still active tat pits, with live gas bubbling up through the tar pond.We did the whole place in 2 hours, moving through the exhibits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tom_B_NJ
40,Very Interesting and Manageable Sized,"If you have a teen more concerned with Instagramming than seeing a museum, this is a good choice. It is small and blends out door excavation sites with a museum showing what has been unearthed. There's enough variety to keep everyone interested for a while.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NaturalizedTexan
40,Fun for everyone!,"I had no expectations. On the edge of Beverly hills is this museum where the dinosaurs once resided. This is not remanufactured nonsense.

30,Great for Children,"If luck is with you, park on the street behind the museum, otherwise it's $12.00.The tar pits and excavation areas are free to wander. See and smell the bubbling tar, and how the animals would get caught. The more they struggled, the deeper they'd be stuck.Entry to the museum is also $12.00. The museum is very small, and as others have said appears dated. Lot's of skeletons that have been excavated from the pits, but not much else.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GWMtravels

40,Amazing Story With Evidence,"This is a one-of-a-kind place. Imagine lakes/tar pits on your ranch that turn out to hold a million plus fossils & skeletons from the Ice Age. From 1906-1912 a million fossils were found and more have been recovered since then. Examples of extinct animals & the skeletons are on display, even the Dire Wolf for GoT fans! The pits are still bubbling and smell of tar & sulphur. Very interesting! Problem: costs $12 to park and $12 each to enter. Park on the street & walk in. A fascinating story still unfolding.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hippotx
50,Great for Kids and Science Nerds!,"The tar pits are real, not just something sitcom actors fall into occasionally! Who knew? The indoor museum is small but packed with exhibits and information. There's lots of space outside for kids to roam and run free and there are REAL TAR PITS to peer into. Park in the lot on the corner of Curson and 6th as street parking can be difficult and time limits are enforced.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gabriellaa169
50,Step back into LA's past,The tar pits give you a choice of outside only or inside as an additional charge. We paid the additional charge and it was worth it to tour the museum.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanL516
50,Very intriguing and intereting,"I was unfamiliar with this museum but my boyfriend had heard about it as a child and always wanted to go.

40,Interesting!,"This is an interesting place to see but don't make the mistake of paying for the LACMA arts museum! They informed us that this happens all the time...We thought we were paying to see the Tar Pit Museum (Page Museum). No one informed us otherwise. We saw some of the arts and had lunch, which was very good, then attempted to see the Tar Pit Museum but could not because we paid for the wrong place. There are also outdoor areas to view as well. If you have an adversity to smell, you may want to take into consideration that there are some fairly heavy asphalt aromas in the air here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MistiMorningstar
50,A definite to see,"It may not be the easiest place to find for a tourist, but well worth the visit. I was fascinated that evidence of extinct animals are stil being found. It is both a historic and scientific marvel. Suitable for all age groups. Kids will love the museum side whilst others will love the surrounding grounds / digs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LadyD29
50,One of the best museums I have ever visited.,"This is a remarkable museum. It stays focussed on its mission of telling you about the La Brea tarpits - its history, its geology, the animal skeletons excavated from the pits around the museum, how the skeletons (and other findings - insects, plants, etc.) are prepared and preserved, and finally - all the fossil skeletons of all the various ice age megafauna assembled and on display. Make sure you walk around the grounds to see the life sized statues of the extinct mammoths and ground sloths. If you are lucky, you might see some liquid asphalt bubbling up through a crack in the ground near the pathway. The museum does a truly marvelous job of enabling you to travel back 12,000 years (more or less) to see what the area looked like and the animals that lived there. Do not do like my nephew did - do not ask the very nice museum guides and docents where the dinosaur bones are located (again and again).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelBill945
40,"Imagine, these animals were from LA","Every Museum is different, most Museums have collective art pieces, but I do not know a Museum that has a collection of animals dug from where the Museum is located. The LA Brea Tar Pits is one of a kind. I would suggest to have a mind set to be fascinated that all animal skeletons or bones you'll see inside the La Brea are animals found in that area. Do not expect this Museum like ""the more the merrier"" art type museums. It's a real deal what you see inside and you may experience to pull a pole/stick with tar pits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rockf2016
30,Great Place that Needs an Update,"I have heard about the La Brea tar pits all my life. I finally had the chance to visit last week while on vacation in Los Angeles. All of the information presented is interesting and accurate, but it is very obvious that the museum curation was done in the 1970s and has not been updated. They need some investment in order to have modern presentation of their information. I am glad that I went, but I would not return for a subsequent visit unless there was significant upgrades and improvements.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/revbrandonrich
50,Loved it,I was not too keen on this visit when it was suggested but boy was I wrong. Tar pits in the middle of concrete jungle. You can even smell the tar. Great displays of animal skeletons taken from the site and it is still active.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ninab301
30,Some interesting bits,"Although bits of this are interesting, it could be better done. It's great seeing the bones of all the animals they have found in the pits, and see the pits bubbling, but quite a bit could have been better explained.The start of everything should have been an explanation of what the pits are, and the geology behind them. We had to really seek this information out, and there wasn't enough on it. Also there is a small human leg bone (doesn't explain which part) in the exhibition, but nothing on the interaction between humans and the tar pits. And there is nothing on whether animals still get stuck, or the process of preserving the bones over time.The smaller tar pit where people are still excavating is fun and interesting, but the others are just bits of tar with fencing.This place has so much potential, but at the moment it is mediocre at best.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Np3008
30,Cool place but with a very dated and underwhelming museum,Let me start by saying I am a paleontology nut and was very excited to visit this place. When you enter the grounds you can immediately smell the tar and in the big pits as well as throughout the grounds are pools of tar with gas bubbling out of it. We first visited the museum which was $12 a person. For the amount of fossils they have found here and breath of specimens they have collected the museum was very spartan and kind of dated. It is a huge circular building with a many glass displays right out of the 1970's and the actual mounted fossils are far and few between. They had a cool back-lit wall full of dire wolf skulls that was really cool but otherwise I was very disappointed in how dated and spartan the museum was.After the museum you can visit a few dig site area. The first two are not active sites so they are just pools of tar with a lot of leaves and trash stuck in them. They have an active site where you can use viewing windows to see into the dig pit but there was no one working down in there so not much to see.I wanted to love this place but walked away disappointed with how dated it felt and how plain and uninspiring the museum was for such a special and unique place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TexasTraveller56
50,Great that you can park and walk around for free!,Lot was full and we drove around a bit and found on street parking somebody had paid for 3 hours and left. So we parked for free and walked around the tar pit and park and enjoyed the beautiful day for free.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S8epilot
40,Unique and worth 2-3h,"The La Brea Tar Pits is a small park where one can see the asphalt pits that trapped saber tooth tigers, some large birds, sloths, and many smaller animals 20 to 55,000 years ago. An actively excavated site can be viewed as can several smaller pits and the larger lake area. The park is free; the small museum (admission $9-13, +4 for the movie; packages with Natural History Museum such as $99 annual family membership) houses numerous skeletons excavated over the past 100 years from the site. Overall, educational both for children and adults and well worth a visit of several hours. Parking was not difficult on the street, but at peak times a $12 lot exists.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelerSFBayarea
40,"Very interesting, neat place to walk around.","This was a very cool place. It is neat seeing the pits still bubbling and there are random spots in the park that has just a little tar coming up that you can touch if you want. It is good for all types of itineraries. If you want to do all of it, you can buy a ticket and spend at least 2-3 hours exploring with 3D movies and special exhibits and all the different pits. If you have a little less time, you do have to see all the different pits. Just read through some of the exhibits and the main pit. You can even do some for free. There are a few pits that you can see and read about so at least you get an idea. One of the best exhibits was where you can feel how hard it would for animals to try and get out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelhR4757OG
40,Very unique!,It's a really unique little museum! I've never seen tar pits before and these are all free in a park outside the museum.

50,Fantastic! Should be #1 thing to do LA,The La Brea Tar Pits is simply fantastic and a must do while you're in Los Angeles. Not only do you learn a bit a prehistoric Los Angeles but you get to see some fantastic fossils and topography. The tar would be completely mesmerizing but for the aromatics of the crude oil.You can walk the grounds and see the tar pits for free; admission is required for the museum and there is a separate fee for a 3-D movie. Walk through for free and gauge your further interest.Nearby there is a Starbucks for refreshments.

50,Fascinating,I have been here before and enjoy it as much as the last time. The history and archeology of the region is enjoyable and fascinating. You can tour the grounds for free and the museum is $12 for adults. This is an enjoyable way to spend several hours.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FLKaman
40,Went on Monthly Free day...,"Arrived around 11 am,weekday, easily found street parking and used my bank card to pay for 3 hrs. The museum is small, well organized, with fossils, skeletons, topography/environmental maps, a viewing area to watch the archeologist clean, identify, categorize and log, findings. The museum is small, even the most interested, read everything, visitor should need less than 2 hrs. The grounds are nice, the asphalt pools, current and past dig sites are easily accessible with stroller or wheelchair. Some volunteers were working a dig site and happily answered questions. There are free walking tours available too, hourly I think. I went on Free day, first Tuesday of the month, but reg. fee is reasonable. Try to street park before paying $15 for museum lot. When we returned to our car we still had 35 min. Left on the meter. Other nearby things to do for the LA Visitor...other museums along museum row LACMA AND ARTS AND CRAFT, farmers market on Faifax and The Grove shopping mall, CBS, Cantors Deli, La Brea Bakery. Have fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alisaj_12
50,Fun for the whole family!,"It's not always easy to find places to go with tweens and teens; however, this Museum is definitely appealing to those picky, technologically addictive teens! I definitely recommend taking the tours, because you get a more out of the entire experience and it just makes it more interesting. Also, be careful with the presentation they do inside with the puppet; that is best only for families with small children. To make it even more enjoyable we crossed the street to where all the food trucks gather, so our picky tween girl and teenage boys could enjoy picking out exactly what they wanted to eat. Then we went back and continued enjoying the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/claudiacU7223DW
40,Fun for the little kids,"I used to take my kids where when they were little. They loved it. It's small, so it doesn't wear them out too much. There is enough for non-readers to look at and have fun with, and enough information to keep the parents interested.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmyWW
50,Dinosaurs!,"I loved my day at the Tar Pits! History is still a reality here, and it is so fascinating to view the fossils, see the bubbling pits, walk the grounds, and reflect on the days when Wooly Mammoth's roamed the very earth you are walking on.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/napakettu7
50,Tour the park and the tar pits for free - great time,We just walked around the park and looked at the tar pits. The signs with information about the history of the tar pits were really interesting. There's no charge for walking around the park and viewing the tar pits.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ATrusty
50,Fascinating place,"As a native of the East Coast and an infrequent visitor to LA, I had no knowledge of this place. It was a pleasant surprise. The museum and tar pits are super-unique. Our preteen daughter, who loves bones, was in heaven. You can watch researchers at work, see active excavation sites and learn lots.If you have a spare hour or three, this is a worthwhile trip.It is also in the same vicinity of several other museums, making it easy to satisfy a family like ours with kids who have varied interests.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paul-delaware
50,One of the best museum deals in the LA area,"This museum and park is one of the most unique ones ive ever been to in that it is both an active geological site as well as an active archeological dig site. You will literally see pools of bubbling asphalt. You can also walk by active dig sites and see them digging out new fossils. If you don't want to go inside you dont necessarily have to pay, but its not expensive and the museum holds literally thousands of fossils of mammoths, sabre tooth tigers, dire wolves and other animals and plants from tens of thousands of years ago that got trapped in the naturally occurring tar pits. There is also a glassed in laboratory where you can actually see scientists at work reconstruction and cleaning the fossils. Truely fascinating and one of the coolest museums ive ever seen.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tonyh120
50,What's Old id New Again,They have made some great strides over the years to this place. Same great space all new digs. Jazz in the summer nights and restaurants nearby make it a all day trip.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dar37
40,Fun place to learn,This is a cool place to visit with friends and learn about paleontology and what not. The exhibits are well described and the conservation lab was a highlight.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/moupim
50,Loved this! Dont miss it when in LA!,"This museum was really fascinating. I loved it so much more than I anticipated. This period in history is often overshadowed by the dinosaurs and it was quite intriguing to learn more about this era. Our whole family really learned a lot here, wish we could have spent more time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/urban_girlie
40,Unique in the world. Worth a one-time visit.,"Famous, and different. Worth visiting for adults or families. Walk around outside, 'enjoy' the smell of the tar, then retreat to the museum and gift shop. The short #D movie is worth seeing. Select Tuesdays are free days.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SLyleK
40,Tar in the middle of a city,"The La Brea Tar Pits and Museum was well worth the trip. A lot of history to read about the area and the creatures which have inhabited it. Actually seeing new areas that have popped up and are oozing tar is pretty cool. This is a good visit for adults and children, especially if you have children with an interest in dinosaurs/prehistoric animals.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/micheles955
50,An awesome museum!,The La Brea Tar Pits Museum (and the tarpits & grounds) are one of my favorite locations in Los Angeles. The museum has a beautiful atrium and lots of amazing interactive exhibits. I recommend the entire thing!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/280zacharyw
50,A Site Of Real Importance,"There are many places you can visit in this world, but not very many will exceed the scientific significance of the La Brea Tar Pits. Much of what we know about animals that lived in North America in the last 40,000 years or so comes from this one place. This is not a whole-day activity, but it is well worth stopping by for a couple of hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KS80537
40,Great fun for the kids!,Incredible experience for the children and interested adults. The tar pits are unique to walk around and see in person. The grounds and museum are worth an afternoon. The movie is educational and fun. I would suggest spending two hours plus minus for this attraction. The museum is tarting to show its age and needs updating but still worth it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/623scotts
50,Fascinating,"Educational, seen in films and a great museum to boot. Alcohol is forbidden in the park but the cafeteria by the gallery sells beer. Weird!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JockM_13
40,Interesting and educational,Interesting to visit a museum that exhibits artifacts found right outside of the doors.A lot of good displays and information.Spent 2 hours and went through the whole place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HansDonnie
50,"Great outdoor activity, but go in the afternoon!","The La Brea grounds are amazing! Great photo op! However, the museum is extremely small! Wait 45 before closing and get in for half price! You'll be done with the museum within that time! The grounds are amazing, so go early to walk around the grounds, which are free, then go to the museum before they close. It would be a great place for a picnic, but the smell of the tar pits does get to you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/frenchievern
50,La Brea with young children,"The tar pits were great fun, unlike most of the museums which pick artifacts from around the world or create replicas and put them together under several sections, it is very unique that the artifacts were dug from the site of the museum itself or nearby and focuses on only one topic so at the end of it you feel you have gained certain amount of expertise about the topic !The museum per se is quite small but to get the best value for the place we went for the guided tour which is a nice easy walk in the park which even our little ones could handle and to make it even more unique the area had an interesting smell! Then we watched the movie and finally saw the museum to tie it all together. I think experiencing them would probably yield the best value for time and money.To add further value and save money for our tickets we got the combined ticket for tar pits and natural history museum. Also worth noting It is 7 miles away from the natural history museum and would take at least 30 mins to get there, so when planning to buy a combined ticket please factor in for the time and distance.Finally a note about the hospitality of the staff working there. The museum doesn't have a locker room facilities and since we were traveling in Uber we had a couple of booster seats with us so I called them before I got there and checked if they could hold our booster seats so we don't have to walk around the museum carrying them they kindly acknowledged and held them making our visit hassle free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vedh08
50,Great 1/2 day adventure,"This has long been on my bucket list and we enjoyed the visit. Timing was not ideal as Sunday of Memorial Day weekend did not have as many of the scientists actively working as normal workdays. I was interested in the actual fossil recovery process, so really wanted to see that piece more than any of the other exhibits. The information is the museum and the movie presentations are helpful to provide context before going out and looking at the pits. I was surprised by the overall density of the fossils being recovered, especially for such an urban area. This is a great 1/2 day adventure to do with family if you want to mix in a little learning along with enjoying a park like atmosphere in the middle of the city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/247wendyn
50,Interesting and very educational.,"This was my first visit to the La Brea tar pits & museum. I studied both geology and paleontology while attending University, and I found the information presented to be very fascinating.I have an affinity for this sort of stuff, and if you are looking to learn more about the ice age and the fauna living during that time I highly recommend this as a stop or regular visit if you're a local.All in all, well worth the trip into L.A., and the time & money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DaveH1965
40,Very interesting,This museum was very interesting for the children. Lots of things to see and learn about prehistoric times. The grounds are kept impeccable and the staff were very friendly and helpful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Daivira
40,Great place,"The park is free (but you pay for parking the car). In the park you can see the tar pits and watch methane bubbles popping up into a lake full of asphalt (the natural version of tar) for ages. Then you have open old pits to see, plus ones being newly excavated - to see bones being finely chiseled out of solid asphalt with a dental pick is fascinating. Around the park as sculptures for the kids to play on. You have to pay for the museum but you get to see some of the full skeletons and random bones that have been discovered and attend the show. A fun, informative day out. Buy your tickets before you get to the museum as the lines are shorter.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Puppynic
50,Very cool look back at history,"I was pleasantly surprised by our visit to the Tar Pits. Once you get past the smell (think freshly paved road), you will enjoy an adventure back in history. The 3-D show was very interesting as were the tarpits themselves. I'm amazed at how many fossils they have extracted - and continue to extract from this space. What also makes it interesting is that it's smack in the middle of LA - right down the street from many television headquarters. Worth checking out at least once when in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CTHeather
40,Fun trip,"We enjoyed our time here, especially the tar pull. Another great activity was the guided tour, though it is outside the information is amazing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/krg999
50,Loved this!,"I'd wanted to visit here after seeing it feature in several disaster movies! It didn't disappoint - if anyone told me I'd happily watch methane bubbles popping up into a lake full of asphalt (the natural version of tar) for ages, I'd have laughed, but it was great fun anticipating where the next eruption would be and how much force would be behind it. Then you have open old pits to see, plus ones being newly excavated - to see bones being finely chiseled out of solid asphalt with a dental pick is fascinating and then there's the museum to see some of the full skeletons and random bones that have been discovered. It's a fun, informative day out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheReedies
50,Great history lesson,Great history lesson about prehistoric LA. Tar pits are still bubbling and new information learned all the time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lazy-Daizy-10
40,"Very interesting, and a bit smelly!",We did the museum and the tar pits and found them very interesting. The kids got a kick out of the tar still oozing through the grass today.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JarlSz
50,For the Science/History Geek in all of us,I took my husband here as he is a science and history buff. We really enjoyed how everything is presented and laid out. Nice walks and easy access between active tar pits and the museum itself. You really need to see this for yourself to believe that the animals of this magnitude actually roamed were Los Angeles is now. The smell of tar is in the air everywhere but so worth the visit! It was also fun to see the actual active archeologists working inside the lab and still sorting through thousands of boxes and identifying bones!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CSatterwhite
50,Bubbling asphalt!,"I have always wanted to see the La Brea Tarpits since the movie ""Volcano"" with Tommy Lee Jones came out (1997). It bubbles more than any Youtube video I was able to pull up. Big gurgly bubbles. Smells like a road being freshly paved. I was really excited and not disappointed at all. The museum was nice. I really would have liked to see the 30 minute movie about the pits, but it was sold out. Be sure to pre-purchase the ticket for this.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashlandmatt
30,Where are the animals?,"The La Brea Tar Pits museum has the potential to be one of the best sites in LA, and about 20 years ago it was. Sadly, today it is not. The museum has severely pared back its skeletal displays, showing one animal of each type found in the tar pits. The wooly mammoth display is impressive, but the giant sloth display is not that easy to view. One does not get the proper perspective of how massive the skeletal remains were from these deposits (thousands of animals over a 40K year period). Instead there is a movie that tries to convey this point, and it is a good introduction but is not as impressive as the previous animal displays. There is room in the museum to increase the displays at least 50% if not 100% - why not do this? The outdoor tar pits tour was cool, but again, I would like to see more animals on display. This museum can be seen in less than an hour (including the movie) because there's just not much there. Bummer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S6567YEdavej
50,A morning full of Fun & Learning!,"I was not so sold on the idea of going to la brea museum... OMG I was wrong!!It was so educational and fun at the same time. My 9 yo enjoyed every minute.The movie was not very impressive but very informative, so you appreciate the fossil excavations more !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karife28
50,must visit for history/science lovers,Very educational for all ages. Younger children might not understand everything but the dinosaur replicas will keep them entertained.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tigers8932
50,A Piece of History - Suspended,Catching up now on a few of the places we hit during our March 2016 West Coast swing brings me to the La Brea Tar Pits in Hancock Park on Wilshire Blvd. If passing through the Hollywood area do stop by the tar pits and museum for a snapshot of early life captured in the pits. The visitor center has really made the experience much better since my initial visit many years ago. I think it's a worthy destination for all ages. I can't believe how the area has developed from the many open pits that were present.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H8443OUjamesc
40,Interesting for all ages,"I did not know what to expect here but its interesting, even for an old adult. There is plenty to see inside and a cafe/garden to relax in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/epicerie
50,Entertaining science journey,"Don't come here worried about your budget; even if you don't have cash to spare, a walk around the grounds costs nothing, and if you arrive after 9 am you may see scientists at work retrieving and categorizing fossils. There are also multiple benches around the famous lake pit, so you can watch the pit for tar bubbles and bursts of gas from the depths of the earth. Walking trails will lead you to other pits along with signs describing prehistoric LA and the animals that inhabited it.If you have a spare $12 per person, check out the museum; it is filled with fascinating fossils and fun exhibits, such as a simulation of what it is like to be stuck in tar. For $4 more you have a choice of a movie about the history of the pits or one of my favorite parts of the museum, the Ice Age Encounter. In this show, a combination of puppetry and animatronics brings a Sabertoothed Cat to life to roar at the audience and intimidate everyone present. If your kid has a great ""flight"" reflex it may not be the show for you, but at the early morning show I attended there were many excited four and five year olds. At the end of the show they got to touch a replica fossil as well, making the $4 an excellent bargain.Overall, this is my favorite place I visited in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SrarMilor
50,A must-visit place for nature / history lovers,"Want to see real evidence of the not-so-ancient past, complete with mammoth-trapping tar pits and current evidence of underground oil reservoirs still oozing black-as-midnight asphalt? Well, here you are! It's anthropology come alive from the last ice age, right next to the LA County Museum (aka LACMA). Walk the grounds and smell the geology up close. See the lake and a full-scale diorama of a trapped mammoth.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ARLVAGUY
50,"Fantastic museum and grounds, great for families","Ever since we had started planning our Los Angeles vacation over spring break, a visit to the the Tar Pits was near the top of our must-see list. We were very impressed by the grounds with the active dig sites, the Page Museum, the film we saw, our guided tour, and all of the exhibits. We’ve been to some great, world-class science museums in our travels, and this one ranks up there with the best of them. Our 11-year-old daughter loved it, and we could have spent the rest of the day there easily. We left with a solid understanding of what the Tar Pits were all about, what makes the “tar” so dangerous, and were blown away by the amount of fossils and evidence of past life that has been, and is still being, dug up.If you or your family are science geeks, La Brea is worth a couple of hours out of your day to explore and take in its history—but don’t be surprised if you end up staying for much longer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dunadan
40,Educational - nicely done,Parking is $12 plus entry fee. I think $9 for senior ages. The museum was interesting especially getting to see some of the staff working (cleaning pieces that were located at the site). They have one tar pit where staff is actually working and you can watch. The day we were there they wouldn't let us in because they said kids on field trips were going to be occupying the area. That made no sense that two people (us!) couldn't go in for the few minutes to see the area. There wasn't a child in sight and the park was virtually empty. Poor judgement on the part of the employee not to let us step in for just a few minutes. Otherwise a very pleasant experience. About two hours is a maximum time to spend here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dps_Sedona
50,An absolute Must,"This provides an exciting look into our past. Unlike anything in Los Angeles, you will never forget the experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/keithp867
50,We mini-mooned at the pits,"So we did exactly that in Los Angeles area. We figured we will mini moon our way around the world. The La Brea tar pit is a must visit. So much to enjoy there. The exhibits are informative and really well put together. Some of the exhibits are even hydraulic creating a live-action experience. They also have real archeologists working onsite digging up real fossils and cleaning them. In the middle of the main museum, there's a lovely garden you can walk through. Really well designed and fun. We also love their museum store. So many cool items there. Highly recommended this museum!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Avrilx
40,Interesting piece of LA history,Visited with my son and his family who live in the area. Very interesting museum and actual tar pits. Three year old granddaughter seemed captivated by all the museum exhibits. Fascinating on-site laboratories.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/176vickief
50,Fantastic,"This is a really fantastic place to visit, i'm not sure of anywhere else that allows you to see actual fossils being found, and to interact with the people doing the finding and cleaning of the fossils.The main pit with the animal figures in it is a bit cheesy, but the interp boards explain what is going on.A very interesting spot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bigskip66
50,Great once you get past ticket collection,"I've always wanted to visit this place learning about it as a child decades ago. Finally got here and it met my expectations, other than the absence of a big, bubbling pit of tar.Once past ticketing, the museum has skeletal displays of animals found in (or representative of) the tar pits. The plus is the museum and seeing staff working on the everyday drudgery of going through tar to find the smallest fragments of interest (mouse toes just about the size of a pin head). The excavator tour taking you to pits which may be in active process of excavation is also a plus.You can see some of these exhibits such as the tar pits and the active excavation pit for free if you don;t have time to dedicate to the museum.The ticketing process is rather disorganised and takes a lot more time than it should. Buy tickets in advance and avoid the line. The museum can also lose the photo shoot which is sickeningly like a cheap cruise line experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YVRcockroach
40,Nice walking tour,By far this was one of the least expensive things we did during our trip...only $12 to get in. Thought there would have been more tar pits to see though. Strongly recommend going on the guided tour of the grounds instead of reading the signs. Lots of stuff to read about inside the museum.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dianef721
50,Awersome Adventure,I love this place Ive been going here since I was a child and I have always found it to be a place of excitment and you will always find new adventures here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/289jasminel
50,Lots to see in the museum!,There is a lot to see in the museum! We had a good time walking around and learning about the dinosaurs.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bctabby
40,Great Scout outing,"Took our Daisy/Brownie Girl Scout troop for an educational outing. Girls (6-8 yr olds) really enjoyed the pits and the museum, especially the ""fishbowl"" it's a small museum, but it's worth the trip!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/102mamil
50,So very interesting!,I really enjoy the history that is shared by this museum! It is very nice that they have uncovered so many interesting skeletons! It takes you back to a time and tells how our world was years ago! It is hard to imagine those creatures roamed the earth! This is an absolute must see for the Mammoth lover and Saber Tooth Tiger lover and all the other items they have!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Arlinda78
40,Worth it!,"Really enjoyed. Great education for my kid. Museum has many interesting features. The 3D film was surprisingly well done. All in all, well worth the price and the time to learn or relearn this aspect of the areas past. Staff were friendly and willing to talk and share. We missed the excavation tour option.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Krishnajina
50,Paleontology for everyone,"This museum is a fascinating visit, and a must see if you're visiting LA with kids. From the story of the how prehistoric animals were trapped in the asphalt pits, to the reconstructed skeletons, to the 3D movie, there is much to learn, and sometimes just say, ""Wow."" The star is the sabertooth tiger. However, a recently found mammoth will be a star as well. In the back corner of the museum you can watch paleontologists, many volunteering their time, sift through the material harvested from the pits in seach of even small bones, shells, and insect parts. There is a large tar pit in front of the museum, but off to the West of the building are several tar pits being actively worked. This is one of LA's truly unique treasures, and if you are fascinated with prehistoric animals, then plan to visit for at least 2 hours,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BillTex33
40,A nice break,We stopped at the Tar Pits during a hop-on hop-off tour. It is interesting to see and the museum itself is done well. You don't need more than an hour to see everything. It is right next to the LA County Museum of Art so you can see both in a day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TomW286
40,They have Real Tar Pits,"This is a great attraction while in town. Years go it had more tar pits, but as they started to dry, the City came in an re-did the place. Personally, I liked it better with the old pits and sort of dumpy atmosphere.But those days are gone. But there is still one large tar pit and yes, dinosaurs really lived there at one time. The visitor center is newer and very nice. They are also usually doing some sort of digging and that is fun to watch and learn about. Parking is a fee as is the entrance, but it is reasonable. It is great for a couple of hours and within walking distance of the art museum. Have fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elizabethlascheid
30,Science Geek on the loose.,"I was like a geeky little 6th grader. Undeliverable history at the Tar Pits. Seeing fossil of extinct animals was surreal. It's not a huge exhibit, it didn't take much time to see the entire collection. There is a photographer who will take your picture in front of a backdrop of a couple of the animals. I didn't want to take the picture but an so glad that I did. It's now one of my favorite photos. You will be able to get your photo via the website. I will definitely go back with the grandchildren, they will get a kick out of that. Parking was easy, we parked on the street on a meter and was able to go to the history museum as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sharya2014
50,Great museum about the mammals that got stuck in the tar pits in LA,"Growing up in LA and then leaving and having a child born in another state, when we visited LA for spring break this year I wanted to make sure we visited the La Brea Tar Pits with him. I remember loving it as a child and wanted him to have that same experience.The museum is open daily from 9:30-5 pm and the outside areas are actually free. You can walk around the outdoor tar pits at no cost. You can smell their tar-ness and see the example of how the animals might get caught, the infamous image of the mammoths getting stuck. There are no dinosaur bones here, this is long after they went extinct, but still thousands of years ago.Inside, the museum has tons of fossils with skulls of dire wolves (and a sign telling you to do your best John Snow impression), skeletons of mammoths, camels, condors, ground sloths, and much more. There are tiny shells and many other things that have been found in the tar pits with helpful informative signs. My son thought the museum was really cool and took a lot of photos.There is a fossil lab where you can see scientist at work through glass, cleaning the bones and working on the many fossils they find in the tar pits.There is an atrium garden with plants that grew during the ice age, like gingko trees. There is also a 3D theatre and we watched Titans of the Ice Age. It was a pretty cool short movie. We missed the Ice Age Encounters show as we went on a weekday.The museum offers summer camps, sleepover events, and more.The prices were $12 for adults, $9 for seniors (62+) and students 13-17, Children (3-12) $5 and under 3 is free. Tickets to the movie or Ice Age Encounter cost $4. They do reciprocate with other museum memberships around the country, including ours in Kansas City.We had a really nice time seeing the cool things in this museum. There is a small gift shop too with a variety of items related to the museum for sale.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jelico8

40,Old bones,"I really enjoyed our afternoon at the tar pits. The actual pit is a bit of a dirty pond but the surrounding gardens (with sculptures and buskers) were great.We decided to pay our money for the museum and was well worth the cost.Lots to see and read, and it opened my eyes to a lot of history i didn't know about. Its probably only an hour or two attraction, but you are next to lacma, which is a fantastic museum to visit as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/charlieu44
50,Unique Place,"The La Brea Tar PIts are not just for kids. I have been here four times in one year and find the bubbling asphalt an astonishing discovery in the middle of the second largest city in the country. The smell and general atmosphere indicate that this is real, not a phony re-imagined site for tourists. The museum is filled with proof of the animals found in the pits, and who knew camels were found here? Or horses? There is a lot to be learned about the history of Los Angeles and this is a good place to start.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lesliemac1066
40,Amazing place,This is indeed an interesting place. The mere fact that oil just bubbles up out of the ground is unbelievable. Some interesting facts about the entire concept can be found on the grounds and in the associated park.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/enyjim
50,Fun and educational,"Of all the times I've visited, and for the few years I lived close by, I never took the time to see the tar pits. SO MUCH FUN!

50,Educational,Wish that we would have had more time to spend here. So much to take in and learn. I think a must see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/297allenb
30,Nothing much to see,We were here on our way to LACMA. The park is interesting to walk in. The tar pits is essentially an archaic piece of land where dinosaur can be trapped in their time. They even have an ongoing work for fossil discovery! It's an interesting place to go and definitely worth a fly-by when you're visiting LACMA as it is very close.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/duohungryhippos
50,Incredible,"The museum is beautifully set out, in park like grounds and the smell of tar is everywhere. The skeletons they recovered from the pits are beautifully preserved and presented. I particularly liked the time line around the wall which clearly showed when each animal type became extinct, as well as the development of man. Keep up the good work!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annenewzealand
30,Cool but maybe not a 'destination',"You can walk through the Tar Pits site after visiting LACMA and it's interesting but I would not make a special trip for it. There are plaques to explain what has been found in the pits (prehistoric remains) but none of them were on display, or I missed them. Some photos, etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cheseagirl
30,Interesting place,Went here with my wife and teenage boys. It was interesting information. The tar pit itself was pretty cool. The property was well maintained.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dalep524
30,Not much to see. Museum 1/2 price half hour before closing,Interesting. Not much to see. You will have to pay for parking and the museum. Person at the gate told us to wait until 25 minutes before closing to get 1/2 price at the museum. Worth it at 1/2 price.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lecartes
50,A real interesting place!,"My wife and I decided to go while in LA. It was on a Saturday morning, and I was a bit worried it would be crowded, but it was not.It really exceeded my expectations. I thought it would be pretty dull and not have a lot to see other than some tar pits, but I was wrong. I didn't research it beforehand. It was very interesting, especially if you want to see many great skeletons of extinct animals. They are very intact and well preserved there due to them dying and just sinking into the tar. They're still excavating new fossils, and will be for years. We didn't go to the 3-D movie, but the rest was great. I'm ready to go back! There were food trucks and they were good too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BobB555
50,One of my fave places in LA,"On my latest trip to L.A (April 2016) i finally got myself to the La Brea Tar Pits. At first I took a stroll around the grounds on my own as there is plenty to see and explore. I thought it interesting but not much more. Then i discovered the museum!It's not a huge museum but it is fascinating and educational. I'd say about 95% of the exhibits are real and genuine bones that have been taken from the tar pits. These bones go back as far as 40k years.The cost to get is is cheap at $12 USD and if you pay $4 USD more you get to see their 30 min 3D movie about the pits. this is great for any one who has kids or any interest in the history or the pits.I also joined the the guided tour put on by the Museum (at no extra charge to the initial $12 USD. Our guide was Phillip and from the word go he had be totally focused and wanting to learn. The tour was of the outside grounds with so much history and knowledge what was a simple checking out the pits because a passion for me wanting to learn more and more. Phillip was informative, knowledgeable, friendly and great to talk to. Being guided by someone who obviously has a passion for what he is doing was the highlight of the visit.The guided tour by the museum only takes about 45/50 mins and you'll have a whole new appreciation for what on the surface looks like a couple of tar pits but is actually a whole amazing history spanning 40,000 years.I actually went to the pits twice while i was there i loved this place so much.If you get Phillip on your tour ask him about the 'Squirrel in the Tar story' when he first started...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MuscleDog
50,A fascinating glimpse into our prehistoric past,"Just touring the grounds of the museum is an education in itself with helpful docents explaining a number of working digs that are going on all the time. The museum has the world's largest collection of Dire Wolf skulls, before which you can pose for a great selfie. The girant mammoth will blow you away, and if you have children, you'll be there for awhile.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/area51619
50,Nothing Like It,"It's one of the unique experiences. Very few places in the world have asphalt bubbling up and forming pools. This one also has enormous numbers of trapped ice age (and more recent) animals that have been excavated and are now displayed in the associated museum.Outside, the tar can be seen and heard (methane bubbles), and definitely smelled. There are small seeps in various spots on the lawn, so if you're not careful you might touch some (gooey and difficult to get off; use baby oil or turpentine). There's a number of fenced-off pools, some with statues of ice age animals as they might have looked as the pool trapped them. One of the pits sometimes has working scientists, who will often answer questions; walk around behind the art museum to find it. There's also a large lineup of food trucks on the street around noon, at least on weekdays.Inside the museum, there are well-curated displays of the bones and other items recovered from the tar. Mammoth, giant sloth, sabertooth cat, even one human skeleton, a window into the museum lab, a few interactive displays. It's one of the best museums I've been in, well worth the price (free outdoors, about the price of a movie for the museum, but teachers, active or retired military, and a few others get in free with ID, and some Tuesdays have free admission for all).If you're lucky, you might find free parking along 6th Street, north of the park; otherwise the parking lot isn't bad, and is a shorter walk. Pay attention to the parking signs on the streets!The Los Angeles County Art Museum shares the park with the tar pits, making it easy to combine the two for a very full day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leifb763
50,My favorite attraction in LA,"I've been wanting to visit the tar pits since I first read about them in third grade, and it was even more awe-inspiring than I imagined thanks to the Page Museum. Pay extra for the 3D movie; it's worth every penny to witness what those mammoth mammals must have been like during the last Ice Age. Very well done.The museum exhibits also were very well done, and you can even watch actual paleontologists at work in the lab within the museum. Beautiful, modern building, but take time to walk around the grounds too. The tar lake at the entrance is amazing to see. The methane gases still roil up to the surface, and the sticky collections of (actual) tar and (not-actual) mammoths and mastodon at the water's edge bring home the reality and incredible opportunity of what you're seeing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CynthiaR379
40,Forever blowing black oily bubbles!,"Interesting place, amazing how many animals bones that can be found in just one pit! Good museum, well laid out and easily understood displays. Fun photo's, wasn't sure at first when they were taken but laughed at the result, great memories!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clarao135
50,Great family afternoon,"We took our 7 year old grandson who is a bit of a science geek. This was a first time visit for my husband and I, too. The grandson was so excited and enjoyed every minute of our visit. There really is seeping tar on the lawns, bubbling tar and gasses in the pond and a working archeological dig site. Lots to see and learn! The museum was fabulous. It is state of the art, has a lab with glass walls so you can watch the scientists at work. It also has a plethora of interactive kid games/learnings. This is a must-do if you're near the LA area with kids. The grandson didn't want to leave!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/955stasis
50,A really cool place!,"The La Brea Tarpits are way cool. For millions of years animals have fallen in, and then been preserved. It will amaze you to see what used to be walking around in what is now El Lay.Well worth checking out....and hey, quite close to Canter's Deli too...always a fun place to eat & look for celebrities.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tommyo949
50,A really fun place to visit especially for kids,A very interesting and informative visit. The place is just next to LACMA and you need a few hours to truly take advantage of what is has to offer. I recommend the 3D movie which gives a very nice overview of the history of the place. Kids love this place but adults can enjoy it just as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dasmarek
30,"A unique place, but a pain to get to and not a lot to see.","There's nothing quite like the tar pits, but unless you're making it a day along with the farmer's market it's painful to get to. Also, unless you're reading all of the signs and going to both films there's not more than an hour or two's activities here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DaveS42
40,Interesting find in the middle of the city,"Never having heard of a tar pit, it piqued my interest. It was neat to see actual tar pits with bubbles coming to the top and a bad smell and all! It was surprising to find out so many animals died in the tar pits but neat that we get to enjoy all of the fossils they found. Definitely pay the $12 to enter the museum while there to see fossils of extinct animals. It's not a large museum so getting through it won't take too long. There is a movie too but I didn't pay extra to watch it. It is right next to an art museum, automotive museum and other attractions. Note that there were a couple birthday parties and tiny kids playing a soccer game on the grounds so it gets busy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ctaylor0159
50,Amazing collection - educational!,The La Brea Tar Pits is another must see in LA. Housed within are thousands of skeletons of prehistoric animals that roamed the US and have been preserved in the tar. See open pits where further excavation is uncovering more information leading to new timelines and the discovery of new species.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/580janc
50,Lost a couple of friends in the tar... but we weren't that close anyway,"This is the La Brea (Tar) Tar Pits! Gotta come and see what LA looked like 10,000 years ago, before the Indians killed all the big animals for food. When I was a kid a million years ago, before the museum was there, the whole area was swampy and tar-filled. Back in those politically incorrect days, we played War -- Americans versus Japanese. I lost a couple of friends in the tar... but we weren't that close anyway. I also remember the controversy (when the wooly mammoth statues were being installed) over the brutality of seeing momma Mammoth seeing her baby sink in the tar pool (the beginning of PC?). Ah, memories... But it really is one of the coolest places in LA. Make a day of it with a trip to the Peterson Auto Museum, LACMA, and Farmer's Market, and you have one super LA day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Drucksterino
40,Great place to take the kiddos!,"My kids asked about the La Brea Tar pits one evening when we were watching VOLCANO (1997) with Tommy Lee Jones and Anne Heche. So we decided to pack up the family and make a little day trip to the pits. The kids loved Titans of the Ice Age and the Ice Age Encounters. Check out tarpits.org, the site was very helpful!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/632vincents
50,Amazing site in the middle of Los Angeles,"It is astonishing that such a unique geological site can be located in the middle of Los Angeles. It is a natural tar seep, where oil reaches the surface, evaporates, leaving only tar behind. You can even see bubbles of methane (natural gas) bubbling to the surface, the by-product of bacteria breaking down the oil. Ever since the Ice Age, the tar has been trapping unsuspecting animals who come to drink the water resting on top of the tar. In turn, carnivores try to eat the trapped animals, and get caught as well. The Page museum, which is chock full of great fossils, is definitely worth a visit, but if you are pressed for time or money, just seeing the lake pit, with its Mammoth replicas and the excavation pits are well worth a stop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/13wendyv
30,Very Interesting!,"We went because we had a groupon and I'm glad we went to the museum once, but next time we'll skip the museum and just walk around outside for free. The tar pits are so interesting, especially since they are in the middle of LA. Be forewarned that you will want to sing the Beverly Hillbillies song the whole time you are there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ellieandjeffw
50,Amazing,"Very interesting to hear the history and see it at the same time. Inside exhibit was amazing, and outside was even better to see true pits that are still active.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Blondie1891
40,Go back in time!,"Fascinating, true, exciting to see that which goes back millions of years. See the replicas of animals of the time. Witness the natural tar emanating from the ground. Quite interesting to both adults and children.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rhodad2016
40,Very interesting list of exhibits,"The La Brea offers an excellent range of things to do for all ages, there are still active tar pits that are being currently examined, The guided tour and the lab viewing areas are very good. The shop is a bit expensive and there are no catering facilities on site, not even coffee",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MJC777
50,Great Site in LA,"On a whim we stopped to look at the tar pits in La Brea. The museum contains the remnants of many of the animals that lived in the area, not so long ago. All of us enjoyed it immensely. Get a $2 discount on Yelp.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Strasity
40,Great museum,"Spent an or so walking around the grounds and about an hour in the museum. Was very good, informative and interesting. Would recommend this to anyone who is travelling to the area. I found it easy to get too, and it's right next to LACMA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gnwgeorge84
50,A time capsule filled with fun!,"La Brea Tar Pits and Museum is worth the visit. It's worth a lot of visits. The tar pits located outside the museum are really interesting and worth seeing and the museum in it self, though small, is filled with interesting exhibits collected from the deadly tar pits around the area. You can learn a lot and you will be entertained. I really love this place!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TakingQuarters
50,Great morning out,"Very interesting and informative museum.nice well kept park. A bit pricey,but well worth a visit.nice tropical garden in centre of museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/simond116
50,Active excavations onsite at this museum!,Take the outdoor Excavation tour - it's very educational and you get to observe active excavations taking place. The grounds are gorgeous and all of the museum staff members that I encountered were very friendly and able to answer any question that I had. Great place to visit!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SherryW144
50,A must see!!,"The bubbling tar pit lake is crazy to see in the middle of LA! The park like setting is a lovely educational walk. I really enjoyed seeing the Pleistocene Garden, and to see the natural native vegetation of the area. The Museum is great for kids of all ages and it's pretty stunning to see the exhibits up close and personal. The 3d film is educational and the perfect length, although I found the seats to be uncomfortable. It is FREE to walk around and look at the Tar Pits and enjoy the Park. There is a nominal charge for the museum, 3d film and tour. The La Brea Tar Pits are a must see! Make sure to wear a hat!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/attagirl_007
50,Better than expected,"Seeing this crazy anomaly in the middle of this city, wow. The inside museum has amazing skeletons, history, and talk to the docents whenever you can. You can also see the paleontologists working on the fossils. I am sure the website explains it all. We loved it. Lots of families. from kid lets to oldsters, everyone there was having a great time, you will be very glad you went. The movie is like a well-done Nat Geo sort of thing, glad we spent the extra $4, got cooled off from the outside walk around the pits. GO! Oh, there is a $12 parking lot, during the day we got street parking way cheaper.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/go_mommy
50,Gettin Stuck In The Tar Pits Is Worth It,"What a natural attraction. We loved the history, the museum and the idea of it being right in the middle of Los Angeles. We had one visitor ask us why they had placed in the middle of the city!! Some people are dense,.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tommyboy48331
40,Get a little culture,"I always wanted to visit this place and finally did. Costs $16 for adults and you get a 3D movie included (the 3D aspect to the movie is pretty weak and the theater is really uncomfortable seating, so set your expectations appropriately). Good for spending a couple of hours but after that, your kids will get bored.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/souperdave816
50,Finally Got To Visit The Tar Pits!! Fantastic!!,I have want to visit the Tar Pits since I was a child!!! I was not disappointed. The museum was open and airy with great exhibits. The wall of Dire Wolf fossil skulls blew me away. Do not miss the interior garden and walking around the grounds and tar pond. Seeing tar bubbling up from the grass was incredible. Finally food trucks across the street to the west were a fantastic lunch break and then it was only a short walk to the LACMA next door. Make a day of it!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/968kippm
40,surprising place though over commercialized,The actual museum inside the open park is a discovery I did not expect to make but its worth a visit....As with so many things though the frenzy to sell you ANYTHING is quite crazy since you can see a lot of the actual tar pits etc outside the museum....It gives you an idea on how wasteful it is to try to take oil from this kind of situation and the poor quality of the end product but from an archaeological point of view its quite a surprise.....,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/donaldr645
50,Wonderfully weird in the middle of LA,"Love the tar pits! Fond memories of seeing this when I was a kid, and my 12/15 yo were just as fascinated this visit. One of the coolest things to see/do in the middle of LA. Mammoths! Saber-toothed cats! Great natural history break amidst the other LA sights.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeanettee538
50,Natural and Local History Come Together,"If you enjoy Natural History and Local History you will enjoy this Museum. It does a very good job of blending the two together. We took advantage of the included park tour which visits the outside exhibits. At an additional nominal fee we also took in the 3-D movie. We visited each exhibit and all in was about 4 hours. \without the extra's you can do this in a lot less time. The tar pits provide an amazing time capsule of the past 50000 years and is the largest Urban Deposit of Ice Age Fossils. Of particular importance is the abundance of birds, and predators. Also due to the tar, amazing preservation of the fossils themselves. Of interest were the individuals involved in ensuring that this important Natural History would be investigated and preserved. They also provided the interesting history of the founding of Los Angeles itself. Young children would definitely enjoy visiting and they had many docents on site (we visited on a Sunday) engaging with visitors. Research and Preservation is actively being done on site and you can observe the work being done. We were traveling from Anaheim and did not have any difficulty coming or going. We parked for free a few blocks away as there was an event/walk taking place that took up many of the side streets and the park itself. There is parking on site. We only waited a few minutes for entry at 11:30 but when we returned from the tour we did observe a longer line, 15-20 minutes. Adjacent to other Museums as well. If your looking for lunch there were a about a dozen food trucks just across the street from the park. Staff were very friendly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RTHolt
40,Fossils and Tar,The tar pits were cool and featured a museum with many fossils recovered in the tar. They also let you observe while paleontologists examine what is found. You can see actual pits that they are working on as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/y0da1974
30,If you're in the area...,"The area near the tar pits and museum also has a major art museum, grassy areas for walking or picnics as well as the ""digs"" where artifacts are stored and being actively worked on. For free, you can view a couple of pools that have tarry blotches in them. And the sites where some of the bones have been unearthed. Docents may be available to help explain what you are seeing. But it really doesn't come alive without watching the 25 minute video in the museum (entry fee). The museum also has fully restored skeletons and you can view people working and cleaning new finds. I wouldn't make a special trip to see this but if you are in the area for another museum or the farmer's market, this might be a nice add-on to your day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WiTraveller608
40,Interesting day out,Visited with family and had a great time. It's small and interactive enough to keep young children amused and food nearby is accessible for those with strollers.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/guac_and_roll
30,Interesting,It was alright. The kids in the very large tour group seemed interested. Unless you have a real interest in this I wouldn't put it high on my to do list,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Burten745
50,Good,Tar Pits an amazing park it's also huge with nice views.Close to it there is an amazing restaurant called The Counter a must to go eat at !!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AliKahal
30,Very Interesting but busy,"This is a very interesting attraction, however, there are some issues:The queue for the museum means about a 2 hrs wait, so we didn't bother.Local parking is at a premium and very expensive @ $2.50 per quarter hour...a shame!Most interesting was the photos from the past, which shows mainly nodding donkey oil pumping rigs and not the buildings you see today.You can walk round to see the light display at the local Art Museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/steveo334
50,Do Not Miss This Famous LA Site,"The La Brea Tar Pits is one of those places that should be visited by everyone. Prior to the park, this was a working industrial site in the 1800's . Fortunately, someone with foresight converted this into a park ( read about it when you go....) It seems like whenever anyone digs in the area they find lots of bones (you can read about that too). Interesting to see the small tar spots bubbling up in the middle of the lawn - makes one think about what is really going on underfoot. Visually impressive. Educational. Parking on site for a fee. Admission fee for the museum but not necessary to view a lot of the site.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yellowpixels
40,Cool History Right in the Middle of LA!,We stopped by late in the afternoon during a day in LA and enjoyed our quick view of the outdoor tar pits and watched a bit of one of the groups doing the excavation work. Parked on the street (parking meter-much cheaper) and didn't go inside any of the buildings/exhibits. We felt like this was enough to get a good understanding of what was there and it didn't cost anything other than a couple hours of time to walk around. Worth the trip!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/weathermankc
50,Amazing-a true L.A. landmark!,"Los Angeles has done an amazing job with both the LACMA (museum) and the La Brea Tar Pits. The park-like areas surrounding both museums make for an ideal walking tour--and plenty of welcoming sculptures for children to climb on--yes, that is allowed! The tar pits and the 'creatures' around the pits are beautifully crafted. A must see for all ages!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maruskaiv
50,Well worth your time,"I was keen to visit, having heard about the Tar Pits from the time I was a child with my first book about ancient creatures. A few fun facts:• Tar is still bubbling up into the pits even today.• The scientists are actively excavating and finding new skeletons. You can walk past the area where they are unearthing things without even paying admission. Inside the museum you can watch them at work cleaning off and reassembling animal skeletons.• Admission is half-price for the last 45 minutes of the day, and that is all you need for a quick tour through the museum.• They have excavated hundreds of animals—evidenced by the wall of dire wolf skulls—including creatures you would not expect such as giant camels, horses (which evolved in North America), and giant ground sloths.• They have unearthed one human, a young woman’s skeleton thousands of years old (she is not on display)• It was raining, and this is a great rainy day activity for a family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/52chips
40,Fascinating Fossils hidden in the City,Amazing experience to see the tar pits and the enormous number of fossils they have uncovered over the years there. The 3D Ice Age movie was interesting and a nice introduction to the tar pits. The Project 23 tour was cool and exciting but got a bit long and my daughter lost interest. There's real tar to see and touch. A nice stop for an hour or so.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stephaniemI8283CQ
40,Have to go once.,"A story from the past. Interesting things I found out about that I really do not think about. I can't remember yesterday, much less that long ago. But we all did like walking around outside seeing the different pits in the beautiful weather we had that day. Several different displays in the building. The nice thing about this tour is being able to be inside and outside.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mawdooms
40,Go back in time.,"This museum was a lot smaller than I had imagined, but the exhibits were interesting. There were lots of prehistoric skeletons and I particularly liked reading the story of the founder of the museum. Unfortunately the garden area inside was closed on our visit. There are 3D film shows but we did not go to these so I cannot comment.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/843janiceb
40,Lots of history and cool discoveries,"The tar pits are free and the museum is $12. I recommend buying the museum ticket. You are able to see the laboratory where they are actively cleaning bones. It has a good history of the tar pits and many skeletons of the animals recovered. Some younger children were scared of the stuffed saber tooth and dire wolf, just to warn you. I went on the free tour (included in museum ticket) and it was worth it. The guide was animated and very knowledgeable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/348kelleyy
30,"Go, but no need to budget a ton of time for your visit","It's one of those things you feel like you need to do if you're in LA, and that's probably true, but unless you are really into this sort of thing just walk around outside see the pits and don't bother with the museum. There's really not that much to see. If you go on the first Tuesday of the month it's free. That's when we were there and it took us less than a half hour to wander too. Again, if that's your thing, I'm sure you'll love it. There are a few pits that are being excavated and they were interesting to look at and read about. It's worth a stop. You can park here and go to the LACMA and the Petersen Car Museum, which are within walking distance so pay once and see them all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deltaduck2
40,A Unique and Unexpected Pleasure,"We had read about the Tar Pits in our research on LA, but had not put them on the list of places to visit. One afternoon we found that we were passing, so decided to stop and investigate. From the first steps through the entrance and the sound and smell of bubbling tar and the prehistoric animals emerging from them, there is a real atmosphere to this LA sight. The story of the tar pits told in the museum surrounded by the bubbling pits, is unique and quite fascinating. This is both a museum and a live archaeological excavation. With the evidence of the animal skeletons painstakingly extracted from the pits on display, the number and variety of animals extracted from them is quite amazing.Accompanying the evidence of the pre-history of the site there is also an interesting photographic record of the growth of the area in the twentieth century, from the early ranches to the built up area which surrounds the pits today.Well worth the visit if you are interested in natural history and want to see a sight of continuing archaeological discovery, unique in the world today.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J5042FYanthonyp
50,Learn something new,What a great place to look into the past & see how things have evolved to today. A great learning experience. Put about 2-3 hours aside to enjoy everything it has to offer.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y5069FQthomasl
40,Very informative,Go early to beat the schools. Good static displays. Good 3D movie. make sure you go out the back and see the digs happening in front of your eyes.....,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alan1961
40,A fun two-hour visit for young kids,"We spent two hours here with our two young kids, which was plenty of time for them to be mesmerized by the thought of woolly mammoths trapped in asphalt ages ago. We bought the full ticket that allowed us to see the 15-minute puppet show (which is really just one amazing saber tooth tiger ""puppet"" along with a live person and video screen presentation) as well as the 25-minute movie. We also followed the 45-minute tour of the tar pits (still bubbling after all these years!) around the perimeter of the museum. That was enough for my kids and then they were ready to leave. The information given in those three presentations may get a bit repetitive, but this is a fun, small-scale museum for when you need a break from the rain (or sun). Bonus: the large grassy field next to the museum is perfect for little ones to run off some steam.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelingMom454
40,Outside Pits are Free!,"I've been to the museum before and have loved it, but that was 8 years ago and I hear they've improved it since then. This visit we didn't have time for the museum so just walked the outdoor trail to see the ""live"" tarpits. There is no charge to walk around the grounds, and you can get a map of the pits at the kiosk selling tickets to the museum. I think this could be confusing, as it appears you need tickets just to access the outside part. Not true. This is a great walk and the pits are fascinating. This is adjacent to the art museum, so continue your walk there to see a couple of very cool buildings. We stuck to the outside of that, too. Very nice morning.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sisterbay716
50,This is so fascinating I have been going for over 60 years.,"The first time I went I was captivated and continue to be so.The newer museum shows how the pits were discovered, excavated and show how the continuing finds are preserved. You can see a complete skeletons of many, many animals as well as statues showing what they looked like. There is a good film talking about the ice ages.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Disodora
50,The tar still bubbles up!,"I read about the tar pits as a child, and was fascinated by the stories of the animals getting stuck and eventually being preserved over time. This is a must-visit for fossil lovers and those who have an interest in natural history. It's a living, breathing outdoor archaeology and paleontology laboratory, next to LACMA. We didn't go inside the museum, but the grounds itself are really interesting- it's kept clean and the signage is helpful to understanding what was/is being found in the pits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/priyas454
50,Interesting,We went there for my nieces which are 5 and 14. We all had a good time. Definitely a good place for kids.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AdrianaP748
50,Interesting and educational,I had heard about this place as a child and it was great to finally be able to visit. The park outside is very attractive even if you don't visit the museum. Be careful though where you walk outside - our grandson walked in tar and it was very hard to get off his shoes. The museum is excellent and well laid out. Well worth a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BronwenSydney
50,Surprisingly fun,"We weren't planning on going here, we were at the Art Museum (Turrell light exhibit was great) and saw this. It was shockingly fun and informative. I am going to recommend to my friends and hope you go also. Have to see the Saber tooth !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Flyway2much
40,Worthwhile visit for an hour,"Nice setting, lovely gardens, interesting tar pits. Did not visit the museum but thought it was fun for the kids for an hour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PaulD19
40,Oh my Jurassic Park!,"How amazing to walk around a museum and park full of dinosaur bones, mammoths, and mystery. My teenagers were even freaked out from the seeping tar on the grounds, and knowing that these creatures once walked the earth. We visited during a holiday weekend and missed seeing the anthropologists working behind the glass, and we didn't take the group tour, but the visit was pretty great. We would probably take the tour next time so we didn't have to make up our take on what we looking at.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/123aprilc
40,Great family day...,"We got here for just after opening this morning, glad that we did as it got busy with young school groups.We really enjoyed it here, with lots to see, really good displays, great facilities. We all enjoyed the shows & the excavation tour, they were all really informative & a good opportunity to ask questions.The park itself is a lovely area to walk around & enjoy the space.Carole : )",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CaroleScott
50,Very Nice Especially For Children!,This place is Sooo Nice and Educational! My entire family Enjoyed this outing and was educated and entertained! A MUST See when in the area! Also several food trucks park near the museum so lunch is FUN! Don't Miss This!!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LAVisitors2016
50,I never thought that much stuff could get stuck in tar,"I went to visit my sister and brother in law before a long business trip and one place that they wanted to see but waited for me to see was this place, and it was worth it!We got there pretty close to closing time for the museum so it wasn't that crowded but even with that we were able to see everything we wanted. The wall of skulls of sabre tooth cats (if I remember correctly) was mind boggling and began to really put it into perspective about just how deadly these pits were. The sheer size of some of the animals that they had found within the pits will blow your mind. There is a laboratory where they look for bones visible through glass so you can watch personnel as they find bones and mark them off on a poster along the wall. It's really cool. You can also see into a bone room.The best part is walking to each of the different pits, with the provided map, and looking at what has come out of each and a bit of the history behind them. When we visited we were able to see one of the pits actively being excavated. You can really get up close to some of these pits and that was awesome and I'm sure the lack of people helped. Even if pre-historic animals aren't your thing, as they aren't mine, I would still highly this recommend this as a must see.And there is always the Fine Arts museum right next door if that is more your thing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/210krisg
40,Informative and interesting,"The La Brea Tarpits are a time capsule for North America wildlife, captured in fossils. You can walk around the various (still very much active) tar pits, and the museum was well laid out with exhibits. Informative and interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ice_D_8
50,Really Cool!,School aged kids enjoyed the grounds and museum. Highly recommend the movie and taking the tour of the active sites.Great deal because they honor other science museum memberships!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/434laurat
40,"Cool exhibits, if a little smelly","The pits were well laid out, the museum had great exhibits, and I especially liked the glass booth for the scientists so you can see them work. The tar is expectedly smelly but that just adds to the atmosphere and authenticity. There was even an active dig. The Observation room was closed, and I didn't realise until I git there that the encounters were only on the weekends.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HuzKa
40,Learning that is good and sticky,This park museum in the middle of LA is a fascinating place to spend 2+ hours. The guide tour of the grounds gives you a clearer understanding of the prehistoric events here. The museum and film presentations were well done. Children 4-5+ years could be guided by parents to understand some basic points; for schoolchildren & adults there's a lot to learn and study. The grounds are well maintained and walkable as a casual park experience as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1947markl
50,So Cool!,We really loved it! We were impressed with the museum. The exhibit wall of dire wolf skulls is great. There were more tar pits than I was expecting. It is a neat area. Don't miss this place!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karenbA450HH
40,Megafauna!,"Having studied a little Megafauna at University, I'd always wanted to come and visit the La Brea tarpits and I was not disappointed.After a bit of a misunderstanding with our Uber driver (only $7 from Sunset Boulevard) who dropped us off at LACMA, we walked over to the free exhibits that were outside. There were lot of tarpits and informative signs describing their significance - also a cool outdoor area where real life scientists were excavating.We paid the entrance fee, paying a bit more to go and see the Titans of the Ice Age movie and entered the main part of the museum that was filled with skeletons and informative displays for various megafauna. Unfortunately we had planned our visit at the same time as a school trip and it was a bit rowdy with all the kids running all over the place. Some of the exhibits were hard to see because it was so crowded but we just hung back until they had all gone onto the next exhibit.It would be great if there was some sort of megafauna themed place to eat in the museum. The gift shop sold snacks (yoghurt covered pretzels) and water but no cafe.A really interesting, educational but definitely not boring place to visit in LA. With no taxi rank or wifi signal to call an Uber, we actually walked back to our hotel on Sunset within about a couple of hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MishImpossible
20,"Nothing spectacular.....just ""meh"" !","Guess everyone has their own interests and while some found the Tar pits interesting (judging by the review), we found not much interest seeing those pits and the gooey bubble !It was just all right.......!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kent19
40,Interesting,"Really enjoyed the history behind the many fossils found in this area. You learn a lot about the types of animals that were in America at the time. Very surprised by the camels! Nice visit, recommended!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/347SandraM
50,Surprisingly fun &interesting,"My teenage son was curious, so I reluctantly visited this location. The entrance fee for three of us was $35 after our military discount. We were able to enjoy the 25 minute movie and the entire Museum. The museum is has hands on exhibits and life-size replicas of mammoths and numerous other extinct animals. In addition the surrounding area has numerous active Tar Pits to visit along with a currently excavated site. Highly interesting and I am thrilled that we made the effort to visit this location in the middle of downtown Los Angeles, California.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/susanwR2138KC
50,great historical stuff here,I'm from Cleveland the natural history museum there is humungous so I was excited to see this place. you can see the pits outside for free but the inside that you pay for is pretty good,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eestwood
40,Incredible history in the middle of LA,"The museum itself will take about an hour to go through, more if you decide to watch the 3D movie. Then there are the actual pits to look at outside, where they are still excavating and discovering new fossils. The movie is a great way to summarize and explain how the tar pits came to be. Neat place to take the kids that doesn't take the entire day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/516alexe
40,"Small museum, easy to do in 3 hours","Normally there is a fee for this small museum, but on January 30, 2016, over 40 museums throughout Southern California had free admission for one day. Stephen and I grew up in Southern California, and neither of us have been to the La Brea Tar Pits. I was able to talk him into going on ""Free Museum Day"" even though he had reservations about the crowd and parking.We arrived at the museum area around 11:40 am and was redirected from the La Brea Tar Pits parking to the parking structure at the SAG-AFTRA building across the street. All day parking was $15, but it was centrally located, literally across the street from the mueum. We found the line for the La Brea Tar Pits going down the walkway. I asked 2 girls in the front about how long they waited, and they replied about 20 minutes.The line went quickly. What we didn't know was they had 2 lines to get the wristbands: 1 on the other side of the grass, and the cashier's desk inside the museum. While it was free admission, all guests were required to pick up a green wristband, and had the option to buy any extra presentations not covered by the free admission. We added the 3D Ice Age movie ($4 each), and the cashier directed us to another lady for our free Excavation Tour ticket.We still had about an hour until our Excavation Tour, so we went around the museum admiring the fossils. All of the fossils on display were animals found on the grounds of the La Brea Tar Pits. Ironically, even though the museum name is the La Brea Tar Pits there is no tar in the area, but it is asphalt. The museum itself is small. Under normal circumstances, it would probably take half hour to see the entire museum, not including the Excavation Tour, which was 45 minutes.At 1:00, we made our way to the Fossil Lab, and was able to watch a paleontologist working on sorting small particles before departing for our tour. Our tour guide took us outside on the grounds of the museum, and pointed out several dig sites where they found fossils. We also went to an Observation Pit where they found fossils of Ice Age remains.Our tour concluded at Project 23, which is actively being used to discover fossils and other findings from the Ice Age. These items were found less than a block away from the museum site. The art museum wanted to build an underground parking structure, and while digging, came across some fossils, including a fossil of a Mammoth that was about 80% intact. The La Brea Tar Pit museum dug up the area, and encased the dirt into 23 crates, hence the project name.After the conclusion of our Tour, we went back inside for our 3D movie of the Ice Age. The movie took about 20 minutes and afterward, we took a peek of the gift shop, and walked next door to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) to take a picture of us at the now iconic Urban Lights, before heading home.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/callmemochelle
50,A great insight into the prehistoric past for kids,"Kids will love this place. It is interactive, friendly and accessible. The staff are very knowledgeable and make harder concepts easy to understand with hands-on exhibits. The demonstration of the stickiness of tar for animals was a favourite among the kids I saw. The short (25 min) movie was excellent. It drew attention to the issue of climate change without being preachy, and showed how environments change over time - and how humans need to adapt. The gardens were beautifully landscaped and the shows and admission price were very reasonable. A great day-trip for kids of all ages.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SmileyCoyote
50,fossils and wine,"fossils of drawn in tar pit animals and stories are great entertainment for adults and children alike. We combined it with a glass of wine in the open air cafeteria, that made a pleasurable and educational outing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tani101
50,Of course you need to go to La Brea Tar Pits,"In the 1770, Portola and his Spanish soldiers walked up to what is now Los Angeles from what is now San Diego. They spend the night and then headed west. They followed a trail left by native americans who had been traveling it for hundreds if not thousands of years...that trail is now Wilshire Blvd. Why was there a trail? Because of the tar pits. They used the tar for their boats and their hut building. And before the Tongva people visited the pits...there were the ice age animals. Lots of Mastodons! And cougars and pretty much all those characters in ICE AGE movies. In many ways, the heart of LA starts right there at the bubbling tar pits. Great displays. Great history. Fun for the family. And if you are hungry there are restaruants near by and of course all the food trucks that line Wilshire... how that would have heped Portola and the Tongva!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TracyHawaii
30,Bubble bubble,"This museum reminded me of being a kid again. Some of the effects are cheesy (like the animatronics), but is is a good cheesy. There are a lot of students of all ages here daily on field trips. One thing we find sad:the baby elephant in front of the museum watching as her mother is sucked into the bubbling tar pit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MmeFrog
30,Good for those interested in paleontology,"The site has several actual tar pits that you can walk over to and smell the petroleum. They are all walled and/or fenced so there is no work about falling in ;-) There is sufficient explanatory signage and displays to explain what you're seeing, too. The small museum has some mildly (to me) interesting exhibits The one thing that I found particularly cool was the lab. Big panoramic windows allow you to see the paleontologists and other scientists at work to preserve the recovered artifacts. Actual live scientists wearing lab coats and everything! :-)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sheriff88
40,Stepping Back in Time,"Its a little smelly walking the exterior grounds. To think of its history in that area, its amazing in itself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/angelaaN4135HR
40,If You Love Dinosaurs You'll Love This Place,"This is really a cool place and one of the few where the tar continues to bubble up to the surface. If you have someone in your household who is fascinated with dinosaurs, then this is a must see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EllieRKay
20,Needs more,Maybe a guided tour or a better museum part? We took the kids and it fell flat. The walk around the tar pits was nice.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sportspup
50,Interesting!,My family of teens thought the tar pits were interesting - nice that they have an indoor museum in addition to the tar pits.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BarbaraWin
50,Very interesting place,We love this place! It is so interesting to see all the fossils they are still finding in the tar! We have gone twice in three visits to LA. Definitely not something you will find anywhere.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/499marissar
30,"Interesting, but...","I suspect I am spoilt by having had free access to the Natural History Museum, and other such places in the UK.Yes, the Tar pits are interesting (and I suspect more so in the summer when they are excavating) and definitely worth a visit, the $12 entrance fee is fair. The displays are also interesting and informative. It's just, well, I don't know, maybe I was expecting something else. There was nothing wrong with it, it was, as I say, worth the entrance, and interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/esky1
50,One of a kind attraction,"If you don't have much time in LA but would like to see something unique, this is a good one. The whole museum and gardens are not huge, it can be comfortably done in half a day.As you enter the grounds you walk by the pits and lakes and you can smell the unmistakable scent of asphalt. You can watch huge bubbles of methane break the surface at Lake pit. The museum has a nice 3-D movie and an encounter, both giving a good glimpse into the past of the area. Children will enjoy both. The rich exhibit of fossils is pretty amazing, you can even learn about how saber tooth cats' milk saber teeth are replaced by the adult ones just from a sampling of skulls.Food options at the museum are practically none, so plan on eating outside at restaurants within a few minutes walk. Parking is steep ($12).If you just want to see the pits and smell the asphalt you can walk around in the gardens for free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tomcsa
50,Great museum and accommodating staff,"We really enjoyed our visit to the La Brea Tar Pits. Our family has always been into paleontology and pretty much anything prehistoric so this was right up our alley and we've wanted to visit it for many years. We were not disappointed. The free tour was very informative and our guide was very charming. If you or your family enjoy this sort of thing and you are in the area, make time to visit, you won't be disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LyndaS80525
50,Interesting place to visit,"Spend as little as a half hour exploring outside for free or pay to go in the museum and stay a while longer. The bubbling tar pits were so weird but interesting. You can go into an area they are currently excavating and watch the people work. The museum has many, many skeletons that have been taken out of the pits. All types of animals; mastodons, wolfs, an extinct American horse, bears, bugs, the list goes on and on.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TexasTravelGirl48
40,Nothing like it!!,"It is a small museum, 1hour would be good for the museum. It is a unique museum, with active sites for excavations, you can see the people while they are working on the site. Don't forget to take pictures by the staff at the enterance, it's funny.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/173hanyg
40,Enjoyable & Educational,Who knew all this exists in the heart of present day LA? Excavator tour guide gave a lot of interesting info to add to posted info making the tour enjoyable. Highly recommended for families and anyone who likes archeological topics.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lindawR9945MK
50,Loved it!!! Something very different while touring LA!,This is off the beaten path and so very enjoyable. The ice age remains pulled from the pits are amazing! We spent about 2-3 hours here. A guided tour is included with the price of admission. Some of the areas we visited are available only with the tour. Go and enjoy!!! A bonus...FREE admission for military 7 days a week!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/682margaretq
50,This is outstanding,The tar pits are very educational. Everything was well displayed and explained. It is one of those places everyone should be able to see as there is no other quite like it in the world.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LindaW105
50,Relaxing Visit in the afternoon,"It is definitely a very unique museum in LA and worth visiting. The museum is quite small, only takes around an hour for me. I suggest to watch the ICE AGE 3D documentation movie (around 15 mins), which will give you a very good overview of what happened during that period. I visited the Grove after the museum (around 20 mins walk). Had a very nice dinner and night shopping there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/803oliviah
50,LA's Own Jurassic Park!,"Menacing bubbling tar pits, mastodons and sabertooth tigers. What else can a kid ask for? Great for not only visits but picnics on the grass. And if you look carefully in the grass and nearby streams, the kids can locate their own mini-tar pit blurping away. My favorite! Perfect weekend day adventure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/waltona1
50,Unique area as well as the museum,"The museum has the finds of the last hundred years digging in the surrounding tar pits. There is tar all over the area as well as a lake with ""trapped animals in it"" (sculptures) The digs are still ongoing and there are view points. This is in the same complex as LACMA so you can go from one to the other. The museum is small but full of bones. You pay only for the museum the tar pits and park with lots of tar are free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fem2015
40,"Educational, But no TAR!","The is a well done, educational museum. But the marketing about TAR pits is a little disappointing. It is asphalt, and there is not a lot of active, seeping asphalt to see. But the fossils and and bones excavated from the various pits are incredible, well preserved and worth the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jonsZ5078MT
50,Any Nat History Fan MUST VISIT!,"Everyone in LA owes it to themselves to check this place out. It is incredible the amount of life that use to inhabit this area, and to see their excavated skeletons takes you back to a time long ago, but not as long as some think. THE TAR PITS NEVER HAD ANY DINOSAURS IN THEM, CALIFORNIA WAS UNDERWATER DURING THE AGE OF THE DINOSAURS!!! But mammoths and saber tooth abound in this awesome little museum. Not super large so, don't expect to need a full day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MykeC166
50,Great attraction!,"Very cool museum located in the heart of LA. Tar is still hot and bubbling, and there are actual archeological digs ongoing that you can view.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rduinc
30,Cool working archaeological site,"I actually really like this place. It;s pretty interesting to see that they are still finding dinosaur bones to this day from these tar pits. You can see a real working archaeological dig and lab on site as well as the usual bones, skeletons and films.This is a nice Sunday afternoon to walk though and take your time. The gift shop is well stocked too although a bit pricey.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/719eval
50,Love it,Used in a number of movies so it is fairly famous.More importantly it is interesting and the 3D movie is well done.Actual digs underway make history all too real.Well worth the time and effort to visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TAMAN1951
40,Unusual museam of natural history,"This sounds crazy, but watching bones bubble up from a tar pit is rather interesting. The museum features the fossil remains of most things that have bubbled up over the years. Camels, saber tooth tigers, and one dumb human. Well worth the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ares949
50,Updated 3D movie is awesome,They just did a refurb of the place and the movie . The new ice age 3D movie is so well done. Free for members but sells out quick so get there early . Also lacma is next door so you can do both in 1 day,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lb33wonka
40,"30 minutes or 3 hours, up to you","You can get a glimpse of the entire operation and good sense of everything with a quick 30 minute stroll, including the museum (not including the 25 min 3D film). There are docents available to give detailed tours or you could spend more time reading every display. With a quick sweep, we were able to leave sufficiently enriched.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kauai-Biz-Traveler
40,Understanding the past,"What can I say? The La Great Tar Pits have been around for eons, mastadons and saber toothed cats have been trapped and reconstructed on site. A working Museum of archeological diggings sift thru tar and reconstruct fossils. Interesting and informative displays abound, birds, reptiles, even insects were trapped in gooey tar! Rainy day in LA? Perfect way to spend the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J679XGthomasp
50,If you like bones and stories about how they found them this is the place,"Lots of bones lots of tar, neat place to take photos, and they have a great tour that I would recommend you take, It was worth the cost. Great place for kids and can do most of it on a rainy day",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/816randyc
50,Absolutely fantastic indoor and outdoor exhibit for dinosaur lovers of all ages!,"We went to the Tar Pits with the expectation of wandering around outside, then going in to LACMA. But something told us to go into the Page Museum. WHAT A PLACE! We visited with our 78 year-old friend whose grandchildren are into dinosaurs. We all (no kids with us) found the displays and, as always the oh-so-knowledgeable docents, superbly done. People who say that there's no culture in LA should not only visit the known culture spots, like the Getty and Getty Villa, and theatre downtown, THEY SHOULD COME HERE. Note on entry fees: the outdoors if free, but there is a charge for entry into the Page Museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ESB-UK

40,Nice outdoor park and museum.,Tar pits have an interesting history and their is ongoing research at the site. The volunteers are very helpful answering questions,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrappe
30,Oooh that smell!,Kinda interesting to see the tar seeping up. Was sotra disappointed to see that the main pit was really just a stinky pond- the asphalt had been removed years ago and it had filled with water. Good for a short visit or if you're really into fossils (go into the museum). BEWARE! The parking lot charges $12 even for a couple minutes so find a spot on the street at a meter.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HappyCampersNH
50,great history,"We took part in a tour of excavation site. Dont miss this if available,no extra charge and very informative. We did not do the 3D films as we had no kids with us but they seemed popular. There is some walking to do if you want to see all the outside exhibits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/treetrippers
50,Really? Elephants stuck in Tar??,"Yes it's true but not alive Elephants,-who would believe in the middle of Los Angles there would be Tar Pits! on Wilshire Blvd. with ancients animals stuck in the mix, it's a sight to see. You can walk around, there are benches to sit and enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ronb753
40,Tar Pits are very cool- museum is just average,"As you walk into the park there are little mini tar pits all over. There are also larger pits throughout the park. One of them has a display of animals if the ice age stuck in the pit. A couple other of the pits show the constant excavations going on. These are very cool, and also the signage around the pits is very interesting. However the museum is much like many other natural history museum with just some skeletons and fake animals. (We didn't take time to see the movie). The archeologists/paleontologists working you could see outside. All in all, I wouldn't waste time or money on the museum, however the pits are very worth a stop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YaacovD
50,This place is the pits,"And I mean it in the best way.Just stroll around the park, see the families enjoying a day in the sun. See the kids (the big ones too) playing with the tar which oozes out of cracks in the ground. It is impossible to not smile here.Use this park as a springboad to go to LACMA, the petersen or Canters.Have a great LA day",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Retiredgenman
30,Grounds are ok but nothing spectacular,"It should be noted that this review does NOT include the museum as I did not go inside. I merely walked the grounds and did a little GPS tour of the area.Although the actual park area itself is clean, I found it quite boring. Yes, there are some educational plaques around that give you information about what was there at one time. But the pits themselves were pretty.... lame?Somehow I was expecting something a bit more. I did not really expect to just see fenced off areas of what looked like dirty water. I thought I'd be seeing more actual tar and not just dirt.Perhaps I missed something, but beyond the historical lessons, I came away with a big feeling of ""meh"".Not a place I'm likely to return to.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MattK62

50,Very Interesting - worth the visit,"Right in a are with other museums, LACMA and the Petersen, this is a very cool thing to do. And actual pre-historic tar pit right in the center of LA. Not only do you get the prehistoric animal view, but quite and education on the early days in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/omc3
50,Fascinating,We had a great visit. Museum is very informative and guides are very helpful. If this is your first visit you really need to visit the museum to better understand the site. Most of the pits throughout the site are open to the public with no charge.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/894robertj
50,amazing,this is a relatively small museum but it stands above the history it tells (see what I mean?) - inside is amazing! One can see the archeologists working on site and outside there is a live experience with the tar pits!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Piolho

50,Great half day activity for dinousaur lovers,"Labrea Tar Pits is the premier source for mastadons, sabertooth cats, and other late pre-historic mamals.

30,La Brea kinda boring,"Well, maybe my kids are too old for this one. There's a movie we didn't go to, but here's what it is: a natural history museum with some skeletons. The building is nice. It's in what looks like a park that has a few tar pits. You can go down and look at the pit they are currently excavating. There's a parking lot, but it's small, and street parking it tough, so you'll pay a lot for parking. If there's someone in your group who loves seeing prehistoric skeletons, then go, but I advise getting there when they open so you can have a parking spot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/955annem
50,Tar pits,Great place to visit. Amazing that this was found and preserved in the middle of LA. The building is not very big but I think it is worth checking out. It is free to walk around and see the pits. You do have to pay to see the inside of the museum and the movie.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sharonc300
50,Another Must go!,"Been visiting the ""Pits"" since I was a child. Took my children there and enjoyed the visit--especially the Mammoths, and looking at the current excavations.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Redbird1737
50,Welcome to the Jungle of pre-historic mammals at La Brea Tar Pits,"All you history buffs – want to learn something about the ice age? Visit the La Brea Tar Pits - a natural landmark situated on Wilshire Blvd. around which Hancock Park was formed in urban Los Angeles. The place is awesome. For thousands of years, natural asphalt seeped from the ground and continues to do so till date. On reaching the surface, the heavy oil in the tar forms pools at several locations in the park. Dust, leaves and water cover the area. The thick deposit of asphalt not only trapped animals and predators many centuries ago but also preserved the bones turning them dark brown or black in colour. You can see the specimens of animals that died here displayed at the George C. Page Museum. Life-size models of prehistoric animals are also on the grounds of the park. Most of the pits are fenced to protect humans and animals as they still attract organisms today. There are more than 100 pits of which only Pit 91 is still regularly excavated by researchers – there’s a viewing station. Visit The La Brea Tar Pits Museum. The saber-toothed cat, dire wolves, ground sloths and mammoths are some of the prehistoric species found here. Except July and August, free admission on the first Tuesday of the month. They also have daily free admission for children under 2 and military personnel",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/812jp
30,"Tar Pits - Interesting history, but not much excitement to look at.","The check in process to get a ticket took about 40 minutes as tour groups butted in line. Seemed as if it was opening day of selling tickets, until a young man with long hair checked in and got things moving. Actual working tour is worthwhile but only runs a couple times a day. Young lady heading our group was knowledgeable, pleasant, and enthusiastic, which was really encouraging. Would seem that a major attraction would have this on-going all day. Tar pits are amazing as to what it is, but not much excitement to look at a fenced in yard of tar and leaves. Was glad we went but was kind of disappointed based on expectations.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/veratom
40,Nice Museum,Nice way to spend a few hours. Inside of the museum has skeletons and reconstructions of many of the animals that have been found in the pits along with educational information. Outside grounds have a few smaller pits including where you can watch archeologists work (or what they have been working on).,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hb_runs22
50,Fascinating tour of natural history,"My husband told me about the La Brea Tar Pits, but I didn't really ""get"" it until I saw it. You can view areas the size of small ponds made of tar. One of them is only inches deep and yet large animals got stuck in it thousands of years ago. Other large animals would see them standing there and come to attack them and then they'd get stuck too. They probably all died of lack of food and water. Their bones are still in the ground and there are constant excavations of them. So far 5.5 million bones have been found and are being studied. Take the free tour--it's well worth it. There is also a wonderful indoor museum to explore. Take the kids. It's a great way to learn natural history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ellens294
40,Cool for a quick stop,We visited the Tar pits whilst in the area. They were great to see for a quick stop. The area was quite nice and interesting to walk around as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rebeccarH9114OH
50,Fascinating!,"What an amazing place this is!When you visit, be sure to go inside the museum, and be sure to take the Explorer tour, which is included with the price of admission. It will tell you what you are seeing, and give you a huge appreciation for just how unique this place really is.I think it is necessary to do this, to get the full appreciation of the place. I notice, for example, that another reviewer said there is ""not really a lot to see"" - and it turned out that this reviewer did not go into the museum, or take the tour. So, they missed out on almost everything they could have seen and learned about.The museum is highly educational. I was most fascinated with the gigantic fossilized mastodon skeleton with its huge long tusks, and with the life-size depiction of the woolly mammoth. Altogether there are hundreds of fossils on display in the museum, showing so many different kinds of animals, in sizes all the way from tiny insect parts up to that huge mastodon towering over everyone.The Explorer Tour was fantastic! It starts inside the museum, and then the guide takes you out around the grounds. The tour visits an excavated pit where you see how lots of different fossil bones were found in the asphalt seeps, and you also visit tar pits that are still active there on the grounds right now. Everything really comes to life for you when the guide explains all about how all of this was formed, how it happened that animals got stuck in the tar and were then preserved there, how this park was formed right in the middle of central Los Angeles, etc.The educational film inside the museum costs an extra $4 to see. We all enjoyed it, and were glad that we saw it.Altogether, THREE MILLION fossils have been excavated at this site! What an amazing place!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HappyTrails12345
30,Not really a lot to see,"It was a beautiful day to be outside which saved the visit. Without going into the museum itself, the most visible part of the attraction is a manmade catch basin which is fenced off for our protection. There are several crates with findings to be reviewed and research students tinkering in the distance - again fenced off but this time for their protection. A few spots exist on the grounds, fenced off, which show the asphalt (not tar) at the surface, some people have poked the goo with sticks. Not a lot going on.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ervanowitz
40,"educational, active archeological dig","Still digging in the tar pits, located in the center of Los Angeles. Park like grounds and a good museum. Walking through the park is free and has good signs explaining history. The museum is small so not overwhelming, just enough info. Cost for museum and 3D movie $16. Parking is $10 or parking meters on the street. Very interesting, worth a visit",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/laculturevulture
50,Wonderful Find,"La Brea Tar Pits and Museum is an excellent museum portraying the ice ages, and the tar pits. We learned so much about the tar pits, and wouldn't have hadn't we not come here. The museum is small-medium sized, but too big. But, it didn't feel too small at all. There are plenty of things to do. We watched a film, and looked around at the amazing exhibits. But, the best part of our time at the museum was the tour. Amanda was such a good tour guide. She was energetic, and allowed us to learn even more about the tar pits. Overall, great museum and tour, you can easily spend 2 hours here!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/710maximiliang
50,Loved it!,"This is a jewel in L.A. Although the 'outside' area is okay, the Museum is amazing, totally worth the 12 bucks!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/c0raxx
50,Interesting Stop in the Area,If you enjoy the ancient past and a chance to see has been found about our animal friends of the Past this is a fun stop and if you have kids it is a stop and educational for them. I recommend it as a great place to visit and walk around,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/486luket
40,Won't see this anywhere else,"A smaller venue than expected, but then again, it is right in LA surrounded by an art museum, office building and housing. The size makes this an easy adventure with the family - you can explore but won't be overwhelmed with a large area to cover.You can take a free tour with your admission - both times offered are in the afternoon. Be sure to take in the tour if the timing works for you. You can easily walk the pits yourself, but would miss information. There are a few signs, but nothing like a guide. Be sure to see Pit 93. It isn't active in the winter, but gives a very good understanding of how a pit is dug out, reinforced, and still wet. In addition, there is a section dug out when the parking structure was built for the art museum next door. Really.Inside the building, you can see skeletons representing animals found in the pits, and get a peek inside the laboratory, which is continually working to identify items found in the ongoing exploration in the pits. Inside, our favorite activity was pulling on sticks placed in pots of tar. You really understand why an animal got stuck.Parking is available North of the museum and there is a fee. You might catch on-street parking which has a cost - but it is lower.We were able to catch lunch on a Friday at food trucks parked a block down the street. There were at least six trucks there.You can also enjoy the art museum next door.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BETSYC322
50,Greatest wonder of Los Angeles. A black pearl.,"As far as I know the only place in the world to see and most people are oblivious to it.LA is located on a geologically unstable structure and oil seeped to the surface and plated with water it formed a deadly trap to any thirsty creature. Mammoths, saber toot tigers and all kind of animals were trapped in the tar and superbly preserved for us to marble at. Take a walk in the park and notice the oil seeping up everywhere. Grab a stick and poke the ground and be amazed. Then hit the museum made possible by a true visionary American and enjoy the exquisite collection of mammals and birds in pristine condition. This is really the most authentic experience Los Angeles has to offer. I have taken all our visitors to see it and none has left disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Warlockonduty

30,Just ok,This place is right next to LACMA. It's an ok place to visit if you have some time. Inside is not too big so you'll be able to finish it in an hour or so.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/itsxjackie
50,Very Interesting,There is a small lake with bubbling asphalt and a mastodon family in front of the museum. Inside the museum are many kinds of fossils on display. I was surprised to learn the sheer numbers of fossils they have pulled out of the pits to date. And they're still digging out more! This is a small museum but still a one-of-a-kind. It won't take more than an hour to walk through (unless you choose to watch the movie). Easy access for mobility impaired visitors.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Melodycthomas
30,Ehhh...,"We went on a Saturday and it was packed. I wanted to go to the museum but the line was literally a mile long, so we skipped it. The grounds were kind of a disappointment, specifically the tar pits. They looked more like dirty water with gas on top. I'm still glad we went to experience it, but I don't think I'd go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jennifer1347
50,The Page Museum,Great trip with the grand kids and daughter. Great guide and fun experience. Get there early if you want to park you car.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K4443JUjohns
50,A Fun Day,"I love wandering around the Tar Pits. It is so relaxing people watching, being in nature and imagining the dinosaurs wandering around where you are standing now. The smell of the tar makes the experience even more real.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/642marlam
30,Interesting but not as big as expected,Interesting place but not as big as we expected. Unfortunately many of the digs and exhibitions were closed during our visit. The displays were very informative and this was supplemented with a free movie prior to commencing the tour of the exhibits. Once the entrance fee is paid and you are issued with a wrist band you are able to walk freely around the museum and grounds. It was quite fascinating to still see the tar oozing out of the ground. It didn’t take us very long to see all the exhibits and watch the movie – probably less than 2 hours. There is a large carpark – accessible for a fee of $10.00. We actually stayed across the road in the Le Brea Apartments and were able to walk directly across to the Museum. I would recommend visiting the Le Brea Tar Pits and Museum if staying in Los Angeles.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/228tinaj
50,Fascinating look into the Ice Age,"Great exhibits with clear information about Ice Age mammals, birds and other life. Skeletons (mammoth, saber-toothed cat and lots more) are exceptional. Taking the 45-minute Explorer tour provides even more insight.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bartr

50,Fascinating,"It's a fascinating museum. We checked out Project 23 site, saw remains excavated that week, smelled the tar, tried to lift items out of tar (harder than I thought), looked at the 5 million fossils from the past 55,000 years, and realized for the first time while looking at fossils of birds that their thighs are not visible from the outside.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scatterjoy1
40,La Brea Tar Pits,"Who would have thought that you can see a place in the heart of LA where asphalt seeps from the ground & natural gas bubbles up in a lake from a reservoir below? Fascinating if you love natural history or anything a little different. The Museum, which houses exhibits of the remains of extinct Ice Age creatures that met a sticky end in the Tar Pits, is well worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kiwi_Flyer-BF
50,Easy place to take kids of all ages,"We've been here as a family about 3 times in the past 3 years, and we always enjoy it, and learn something new each time.We went today for the annual Los Angeles free museum day, which, although crowded, was fun, because there were staff members all over the place offering up fun info and things to see.We have also been there on the free first Tuesday of the month, which is WAY less crowded, but not staffed as well.The museum is such a an amazing piece of history period, but also Los Angeles history. They have it set up very well for kids (and adults) of all ages. It is just the right size to see a lot of stuff without spending a ton of time, and without little ones getting bored.Highlight for my 6 year old was the thing where you get to see how hard it would be to pull yourself out of tar, seeing the people working in the lab, and the outdoor excavation pit.My 13 old enjoys the history, especially the room with the huge timeline, and my 18 year old liked the radiocarbon dating info, since he is currently taking high school chemistry.We all enjoyed walking the outdoor grounds and seeing the methane bubbles coming out of the lake. It really is something to see history right in the middle of the city.Then we did the 15 minute drive to Pinks for hot dogs, which makes it a nice day.We were super hungry, so we didn't walk all over the grounds, but we will do that next time, since that in itself is a worthwhile outing. And LACMA is right next door, so plenty to do around there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/simplem2013
40,Great educational experience,"I've always been fascinated by ice age animals and there is no better place to learn about them and see fossils and other artifacts than the museum at La Brea Tar Pits. Our family stopped by here after completing our Disneyland vacation. We joined up with a tour group and learned all about the various discoveries, the history and the several pools of asphalt found on site. This is a unique place and I highly recommend a stop as there are no other places on earth where you can see this kind of natural history within a major metropolitan area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OregonFoodie71
50,Do not skip.,"Worth the 10 min. ride from Hollywood and Highland. Follow your nose to the Tar pits and make sure you visit the dig sites. The Museum is excellently presented with something for everyone. Prepare for crowds, noise, and lots of kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrd102

50,Unique,It was nothing like I expected. I learned a lot and enjoyed the experience. I highly recommend the outdoor guided tour.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sonyah930
40,Fascinating view of ice age LA,"The museum has complete skeleton of ice age creatures including over 400 skulls of saber tooth tigers, additional activities are best suited for children like the encounter with a realistic puppet tiger. I agree that the 3D video should be included in the price of admission, the small fees add up. The pits are outside and free to the public but it's worthy to explore the museum as well. The excavations continue. We enjoy this place",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ElenaT3
50,Unexpectedly cool!,"I visited here because my partner wanted to and we were both very pleasantly surprised by how good it was! Wandering around and seeing the active tar pits, where people are currently working, was surprising but very cool to see. The area is lovely and green and would be a great place for an afternoon, and it's free to wander around the pits. The museum was also pretty inexpensive, and was definitely worth the money. The museum was very well presented (after a month of travelling and visiting world famous museums that are just completely overwhelming and poorly laid out) and easy to see everything - and there was lots to see! There's a complete saber-toothed cat skeleton on display which, around every 10 seconds, has a digital image of an entire saber-toothed cat superimposed on it, quite convincingly, there's huge mammoth skeletons and a big display wall of dire wolf skulls, as well as you can look into the lab where people are working in finer detail on the bones - also very cool! If you're at all interested, it's well worth the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/409adriennem
50,Must do,If your family likes Dinosaurs - then go here. Very accessible and well laid out. Lots of interesting dinosaurs on display. The museum is surrounded by the tar pits which make it all the more interesting when you see what has come out of the tar. Kids and adults will enjoy testing what it felt like to be stuck in the tar when they are in the museum. Well worth an hour or two. Bonus is the park land and the opportunity to see a squirrel.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AndreaS301
40,Excellent tour,Our tour guide brought us outside to see the excavation pits and she dispelled some of the myths around the collapse of the mammoths in the pits. It was a brainy but interesting tour and even small kids seemed to be quite engaged in the narrative. The museum indoors is ok but won't take very long to see. You can glimpse the staff culling through minute particles searching for fossils under the microscope in the lab. Parking is on-site and was readily available mid-day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/equinoxWashDc
50,Congratulate Yourselves,"I visited this long ago when the tar pits were a place in a park, not fenced, and had no educational signage. Los Angeles has done a superb job transforming this area into an educational mecca. It is beautiful and spacious and the complex is shared with LACMA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/697pats
50,Absolutely fascinating,"This a must see on any trip to LA. In the middle of don't own is a museum that is unbelievable. You can walk around both outside and inside, seeing active pits bubbling, bones sticking out of the ground, the process of excavation and restoration itself. The quantity of skeletons is tremendous.This is right next to the museum of art, and down the block from the auto museum. Great collection of food trucks on the block.Great for all ages",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rossdmd
40,Unique environment and collection,"As you may know, Los Angeles was the scene of a massive oil-boom which began in the 1890s and peaked in the 1930s when LA produced about 25% of the entire world's output of petroleum.But long before humans arrived, oil seeped out of the ground and pooled up to form small ponds filled with heavy and sticky tar and asphalt. The La Brea tarpits and museum feature fossils from the thousands of ice-age animals which perished in these death traps.You'll see complete skeletons of animals which became extinct at the end of the last ice age due to global warming. Giant 8 ft tall sloths, wooly mammoths, dire wolves, massive vultures, and the ferocious saber tooth tiger are all on display.Try your hand at trying to pull out a metal rod which is immersed in the tar to see how inescapable these pits would be.You can also walk around the grounds for free and you'll witness methane gas bubbling up from a pit directly in front of the museum. There are also fenced off areas where even today the underground oil is pushing its way up to the surface. And you can visit one pit where workers are still pursuing the messy business of extracting bones from the goo.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DoctorM
40,Very Cool and Very Stinky - Kids Should See It,"This place has remained the same for the last 40 years and it is still so interesting and bizarre. Seeing the pits where the tar is just bubbling up out of the ground is very strange given the surrounding city proper. The museum is not too expensive or overwhelming and you can enjoy both the grounds and the museum with kids without getting worn down (and the inevitable meltdown that comes with taking kids anywhere). The little movie is fun to watch despite the underlying ""how dare you contribute to global warming"" theme.Kids and adults enjoyed the stroll through the park and museum and they especially loved seeing the scientists in action; actually procuring fossils right in front of them.Pros: Completely unique place, not too expensive, fairly relaxing given the large parkCons: Parking can be a challenge and the outer pits with the older parts of the museum and the actively digging scientists could use some help.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ParadiseAdvice
40,Fascinating,"I've always been fascinated by the story of the tar pits so was delighted to be able to go. Located on a very busy street, right in the city, it is easy to get to. The grounds are extensive and free. You can wander around and see many asphalt seeps and excavation sites. Part of our group chose to go into the museum. Of the multiple thousands of animals excavated, about 10 full skeletons are on display. I was hoping for a more extensive display. You can view the room where people are looking through microscopes to sort tiny bones. Included in the museum admission is a guided tour of the grounds including an observation pit. An interesting experience. Glad I did the museum tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RBeam
40,Interesting stop while exploring Los Angeles,"The museum is expensive, but viewing the tar pits is free. Walk around and read the descriptions and history of this very interesting phenomena.

50,So awesome for free!,"I wanted to stop and see these (even though most people I told had no idea about them - including the Uber driver!) - it's amazing that these tar pits are in the middle of a residential neighbourhood! Happy to just walk around rather than paying to go to the museum, as there is good signage and enough info to be an interesting visit anyway. As a side benefit, there's an exceptional cafe in the adjacent art museum place that is worth a stop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ds_australia
30,Save some money and skip the museum - the tar pits are free,"I didn't think the museum was worth the money, especially when adding up parking plus the museum fee. I hadn't realized that the tar pits themselves are in the free public park outside.I agree with another reviewer who said the movie explaining the history should be included in the museum fee. The exhibits, i.e., the skeletons and stuffed reproductions are just OK (I liked the bird skeletons the best), with limited explanation, and without a guide or movie, they're not very interesting.If you do go to the museum, be sure to do one of the free tours to get that missing explanation.Maybe the coolest attraction is the possibility of volunteering for those interested in archaeology. You see volunteers working on microfossils, and outside, volunteers carefully cleaning dirt away from the relatively recently extracted blocks of fossils and tar.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Catemaco
50,Very interesting,"A very interesting museum. Great to go with kids. It revealed us very interesting history details that we weren't aware of.

50,Unique and Fascinating,"I am so glad that my family ignored a few negative comments and chose to visit this attraction. We had a wonderful time at the Tar Pits and Museum. This is such a fascinating part of the history of the Los Angeles area.The large pit/pond in front of the museum is such a great way to get your visit started. The museum is filled with skeletal remains gleaned from the pits...a must see for any member of your family that enjoys prehistoric animals or eras. There are areas in the museum to discuss the excavation with working scientists. The workers are patient and kind with young and old alike...answering all questions with the same sincerity. The grounds around the museum are marked with tar areas that continue to bubble to the surface. There is also an on-going excavation that started with the building of a parking lot for the art museum next door.In short, ignore any negative reviews and make this museum a part of your next visit to Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BillK427
40,Huge park and must see,"We enjoyed our visit to the La Brea Tar Pits. We were able to find convenient street parking just a few blocks away. There was a line to get into the museum so we skipped that but really enjoyed walking around outside and looking at the tar pits. You can smell and see the tar bubbling up from the ground, the kids loved it! Make sure you walk past the observation area and to the art museum's outdoor area too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luckyno39

A big thank you to Philip who helped answer so many of our questions and we really learned a lot about this beautiful place.My husband was tickled pink by how the tar pits became a death trap not only to the plant-eaters, but also the carnivores as well.The Titans in the Ice Age 3D Show was really informative and the life-sized sabre tooth tiger actually scared a little girl to tears!To a couple of urbanites like us, the La Brea Tar Pits is a really amazing place rich with natural history!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Keqing

This is an incredibly rare natural phenomenon that only takes place in a few places on our planet, but has been in the same place in the LA Basin for 10,000 years. If you aren't dinosaur and pre-historic animal fans when you arrive, you will be when you leave!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DiegoCandela
50,Never get tired of this fascinating spot,My kids keep forcing me to come back here but I'm always fascinated by the place--as are they. The fact that there's still bubbling tar everywhere makes it even more fascinating as you pick your way through the exhibits of the incredible creatures that once roamed Los Angeles. Plus the landscaping is a lot of fun. Try rolling down those gentle sloping lawns---they seem to have been designed for it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Burbatana
40,Totally cool exhibits!,"I have visited the tar pits in the past (walked the outside grounds) which is worth the visit. You can see various observation pits on the ground. This last visit we took our young boys inside the Page Mueseum - wow! They have awesome fossils, including an almost complete mammoth. There is an area where you can watch scientists at work and the docents are wonderful. The ticket includes a movie and tours - we did not do that this time.I recommend buying tickets online - there is one kiosk near the parking lot - only one register the day we were there. 20 minutes later we were still inline. The line at the main entrance finally let up and we moved there (4 registers). Another 20 minutes in line. During that time I bought the tickets online and we moved to the online ticket holder line - total wait would have been 15 minutes!Bring a picnic and a ball and enjoy the day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/362hilaryd
40,Fun visiting somewhere I had heard of all my life,We really enjoyed visiting the museum and seeing all it had to offer. It is astounding how many animals were trapped by the asphalt ponds located here. Very nice displays with plenty of information. The 3D movie presentation was good and not too long. The other presentation was also good however the seating is a little awkward.Overall a great experience and a great place to take children 4 years old and above.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/patrickrJ7317EV
40,Interesting,A good day out for all the family. Some very interesting exhibits. We visited on a week day and there is a good amount of parking and the museum is not overly busy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Olly13538
50,Incredible information and history,"Throughly enjoyed the couple of hours spent hanging around the museum, incredible content with quality fossil remains. Loved this!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shahns2014
50,It can be sticky,"What an amazing place and what an amazing museum!!! What a place for kids of all ages. It's hard to realize that this spot was smack in the middle of the LA oil boom from a century ago. The grounds are peaceful and idyllic, if you can overlook the occasional smell of asphalt. The Lake Pit with its bubbling methane pools and other (still active) pits are beyond cool. But watch out for the green cones and small fenced off areas where tar/asphalt continues to break through from below the surface. You can watch archaeologists and volunteers as they excavate the pits, and watch researchers and volunteers in the lab inside the museum clean fossils and search for microfossils taken from excavations. The museum does an excellent job laying out the history of the site going back to the last ice age with beautiful displays of the fossilized remains of mammoths, dire wolves, sabertooth cats, birds et al. And if tar pits aren't your thing, the LACMA is right there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/connier603
40,You need half a day to do this justice,"We had a couple of hours with our two adult children who did not remember ever being here before. It's way better than the last time I went 20+ years ago. You can walk around outside and see some interesting things, but the Page Museum of the Tar Pits is well worth spending some extra time there. We ended up buying a couple's membership, since it also works at Natural History Museum - this was the bargain option.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mahsha57
50,A very interesting visit,"My wife and I really enjoyed our visit to the tar pits museum. We are in the mid seventies and learned of the La Brea tar pits in school as children. Over the years the remarkable finds there peaked our interest and visiting it was a high for us. It isn't glamorous or fun in the sense of rides, food etc. Rather it is a well done educational experience about extraordinary things.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y4125OYjohni
50,Amazing!,"We only visited the outside attractions and the tar pits. We did not visit inside the museum due to time restrictions in our schedule. A lot of good information displayed at the pits. Information included what fossils they have found, when they were found, how far down they were found and how old they are. There is an active site that they explore during the summer months. There is also a site that large sections of the tar have been removed and they continue daily digging through those sections. The museum offers even more information and would be good to explore should your time allow. A very nice park surrounding the whole area with several museums available to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/savedbyhim2
40,Always interesting,It was many years since we'd last been here and it is still an amazing attraction.To think that so long ago wild animals roamed the area and got trapped only to be found so many centuries later is what makes it interesting.Research is still continuing and you can watch people at work sifting through tiny soil samples.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Johnpsau
40,Informative and fun,La Brea Tar Pits Museum is a great place to spend a couple of hours when in LA. Every child has read about it and it was fun to finally see the place. I was pleasantly surprised that it is still a working site where they continue to pull out specimens of wolves and mammoths. The 45 minute free timed tour is definitely worth it to give you the context required to fully appreciate the site. My 20 year old daughter also enjoyed it. Overall an educational and fun spot.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dupetersentravel
40,Somebody help those poor elephants!,"Next to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art is the La Brea Tar Pits and Museum. This museum and the tar pits is another great place to learn about ancient history and geology while at the same time it provides a tranquil park and beautiful campus to find some peace and solitude in the big city. I'm very familiar with the fossils found at the pits as our own state museum has numerous examples of the same, minus being preserved by tar. That being said, it isn't necessary to go to the museum if you just want to view the pits and stroll through the expansive park. If you do go, be prepared to pose for some really cool pictures that you can purchase at the end of your visit. Put on your best frightened/horrified pose and you'll have a laugh when you see the prints.This is a very informative and beautiful museum that displays some of the harsher realities of nature. Be sure to test your strength and try to pull the piston out of the tar. I was shocked to learn how easily an animal or human could get stuck in the tar and meet their untimely demise.By the way, these are naturally occurring tar pits that smell like tar. It's not a rose garden. It smells like tar so don't be surprised.I would recommend this to any first-time visitor to Los Angeles to show how this area looked over time and how it impacted ancient and modern day visitors alike.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Joe_Cool68510
50,A Great Way to have a National Geographic Moment in Person,"The La Brea Tar Pits is one of those places you always wanted to go and it does not disappoint! You will get a historical review, see the bones and artifacts that have been excavated, see an actual dig sight, and reconstructed examples of the extinct victims of the pits. You can see it all in 1-2 hours. The parking lot was full, but we found street parking relatively easily. You can take a nice walk around the grounds as well. A great adventure!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MinkHollowFarm
40,Interesting and educational,Good rainy day activity with the kids. I'd like to see more information on the womans skeleton that was found here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeliaLop
50,You'll not have this experience anywhere else in the world.,"The actual museum is just a part of the incredible experience that can not be duplicated anywhere in the world.Most people have seen images of the Lake Pit located at the entry to the Tar Pit grounds. This is a large area where evidence shows that many animals died by being sucked into the tar. Statues ring the lake representing the types of animals that died there many years ago.Other pits are also scattered around the property. One of them serves as an observation pit and is open for the public to see as workers excavate additional fragments of ancient animals.The museum is filled with many of the animals and plants that lived Ice Age. The bones have a deep golden brown color, obviously the result of being in the tar pits for so long. They have been cleaned and mounted and well labeled. Don't miss the time line to the right as you enter the building. It provides an excellent overview of what was happening during the time both people and animals inhabited the area. The atrium area depicts a typical forested area and has Ice Age plants.Parking is available on the street (free on Sundays) or in the parking lots at LACMA and the Peterson Automotive Museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fro2
40,Nice park,"Didn't go to the museum but visited the park. Because California is suffering from drought, the grass was mainly brown, but it's still a nice park. The smell of tar is wonderful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hamppu
30,Fascinating but not my first choice,"It's interesting to learn the Los Angeles has these tar pits at all. There are no dinosaurs as they had long been extinct when these pits showed up, but there are fossils and displays of various fossils that were unearthed in the vicinity. When we went there, the lab was empty of employees at work, but you can see what they're working on. Check out their website if you want to volunteer and can commit three months volunteering at their lab.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nadarien
40,after 20 years...still pretty interesting.,"My first trip to La Brea was in high school. We were in town & thought we'd drop in for a visit. Still a pretty neat lil place, my favorite exhibit is the Wall of Dire Wolf skulls. Definitely worth a visit if you are in the area. Parking can be a pain, but hey...its LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ewright2013
40,Very interesting place!,"The LaBrea Tar Pits is a fun place to check out. When you drive down the street, you are in a business district, so you don't expect to see ""tar pits"", but once you go in, you will not be disappointed! If you like fossils and excavation, you will love it here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ginasearay
40,Good trip for insight into the past both distant and contemporary,"My wife and I spent several days in early December 2015 in LA visiting a number of things on our bucket list. This was on my wife's as she is a retired geophysics person and the history/geology of the area was of interest.Personally, I found the accounts of how the area came to be a central part of Los Angeles and then a museum as interesting as the preservation of the fauna by the paleontologists.Pick a good day (Not too sunny and good air) as seeing the outside is as important as seeing what is in the museum building though you will spend most of the time in the museum. Parking is not really a problem here(at least is wasn't for us). We did go during the week and that may have made it less traffic that it might be.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/6stanb
40,Very interesting place,"I visited with my family last week. Prior to that, the last time I visited was over 10 years ago. It looks very different - much bigger. I don't recall being able to walk to all of the different excavation sites when I visited before. It seemed like there was a footbridge where you could walk over the ""lake"" in front before, but now it is all fenced off. Even if you don't want to go into the museum, it is still worth a visit around the grounds to see the work being done now and previous dig sites. The line for tickets was very long. There are two lines - one for pass holders and online tickets and one for all others. Buy tickets online to skip the long line.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/132christap
50,Mammothly Awesome,"In planning for our trip to the 2016 Rose Bowl to watch the Iowa Hawkeye football team play; we made visiting the La Brea tar pits a priority in out our planning! And, we weren't disappointed. The park area was clean and easy to access. The museum had outstanding displays! We both learned a lot and we loved the 3-D movie! The bonus was that our membership to the Chicago Field Museum was accepted with reciprocity. So we have extra left over for treats and souvies!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/205erical
40,Nice to see science in action,"Enjoyed learning about the history of this ""tar pits"" location. We toured the museum inside, reading about several topics related to the La Brea location, and we watched a movie that gave more of a sense of how the animals got ""stuck"" in the pits. There was a live presentation in the lab area that showed the current work on microfossils. Finally, there was a live tour of the outside ""pits"" hosted by a guide who provided interesting information along the way. It's a small enough attraction that can take just a couple of hours, more suited for museum and history lovers (and younger children). There is an onsite parking lot (for a fee) that was very busy during the holidays; don't know about its fullness throughout the year. Enjoyed learning the history of a place where science is still currently being worked at.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/20854Dave_K
50,Wonderful museum to visit for locals or tourists,"I hadn't been here for years and thought it would be an old dusty place but I was very pleasantly surprised to see that the exhibits are totally up-to-date, interesting for both adults and kids. This really is a very special place; I don't think there's anything like it anywhere else in the world. Take your out of town visitors here and to LACMA next door. A classy, fun LA experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MANGOphoto
50,Brings science to life,"Excellent museum, with the source of the material right there to look at also. Fascinating displays of animals found in the tar pits, and displays that really show what the environment was like, in the past.A very welcome break from the artificial nonsense that is LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheLongWayHome_10
50,Unique experience,"Not many museums around the world can boast such a collection of complete fossils. This is a unique place. Unforgettable experience for kids and adults alike. Not very large, it can be visited in one hour. We couldn't see the sold out 3d movie.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pibarreche
50,Wall of dire wolf skulls is amazing,"Really interesting exhibit with skulls, skeletons, and even a pole you can dip in tar to simulate what an animal experienced when getting stuck. Small museum, but a great way to help children picture the Quaternary period and understand that there were no dinosaurs during the time of ancient man. Outside, you can spot tar bubbling up through the grass in La Brea park--my son loved it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kimberlyu390
40,Fun and informative,"Large area to walk around outside in good weather that is free to the public. There's an active dig site that people can observe the people digging for new fossils outside. Even though there was nobody there due to the time of year, it was still interesting to see the layout. If you want to go inside the museum you have to pay. I bought a ticket to see a short movie in 3D that was fun and educational to watch.when finished, I went exploring the small, but interesting museum. Fossils were everywhere you looked and there were a few electronic recreations of some of the animals. I would recommend this museum to anyone who wants a fun and interesting museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W8580CTsarahs

50,Fun place to visit!,"Great place to visit and learn lots! Nice to do the free tour and see the sites, but can also enjoy the paid entrance to the museum and go on the tour. Plenty to see inside the museum, too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/geoi836
50,Fantastic and very educational!,My entire family loved visiting this museum. A must see when in LA. Very educational and the entire staff were amazing and very knowledgable. Easy parking and a great museum store with cool items to purchase. We passed on the 3D film.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FirstClass001
40,Educational,Very inexpensive place to visit (not much of that in Los Angeles) and see.See the tar pits and learn a thing or two...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thecompgalKim
40,Excellent place to visit,"This is a wonderful place to visit, especially if you have children interested in mammoths! The grounds are easy to roam around and investigate limited only by your own curiosity and imagination. The museum itself is actually a live research facility where new discoveries are constantly being made and this adds to the excitement of the place. The movie on site was also quite good and informative.They accept museum memberships from many other museums in the country so don't forget to ask if you're a member of your local science museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/721nesss
50,Fantastic science in the heart of LA,"Well put together exhibitions that will teach you about ice age USA. Well recommended. Live science is there to be viewed, with bone cleaning, pit access and more skeletons than a catacomb.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Martlark
50,Kiddo was totally awed by the live digging of fossils & paleontologist at work in their lab!!!,"Something different from other museums is that you will real scientists at work; digging in pits for fossils. Its simply awesome smelling the tar while you see them "" bubbling"" in the pits.Small museum but lots to see & learn. Admission adult $12 children $5.It's a pity we didn't have time to watch the shows. Will definitely come again for a full experience.Find some creepy crawlie snacks in their giftshop. They come in a few a flavors!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Momtravelwithtoddler
50,Good little museum.,Small museum with a fee for entry but you can see most of the tar pits without going in. Very good to see how they have made such an attraction out of the bubbling pits.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nola103
50,Great place to visit esp for science geeks,"The other reviews seem to indicate that there is not much to see here. We disagree--we thought that there was plenty to see between the museum and the pits being worked on. There is a lot of walking so be prepared for that. The tours are well done and the guides are knowledgeable. In addition, if you have questions that they cannot answer, they will find someone who can answer the questions.Interesting factoid: this is not tar but it is asphalt",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elizabethmA9919PA
50,Great museum and world class archeological site,This is one of the most interesting places we have ever visited. The presentation is amazing and fully explained with the museum and displays.

40,"My Girl 2, My Childhood Dream Come True","As a child I my mum would sing the song ""My Girl"" to me all the time. I thought the song was about me, and when the movies came out I was a huge fan. I have seen them over and over again. My favourite part of My Girl 2 was always when they went to the La Brea Tar Pits and it was the one place I always wanted to go as a child that I still had not gone.Much has changed at the La Brea Tar Pits since that 1994 movie came out, there is no walkway overlooking the pits, but there are plenty of walking paths leading to the museum and all around a nice park which also leads to an open and active pit where you can watch them digging. The pits are definitely fun to look at, but the addition of the museum is definitely fun and exciting and worth the cost. They have a nice little garden in the middle of the museum to walk through too. The displays are amazing and there is even an active work space where you can watch them cataloging fossils. Your visit to the La Brea Tar Pits and Museum will make a good few 2-3 hours and will be interesting the entire time. I would suggest even packing a light lunch if you visit during spring or summer as the park areas outdoors are very nice and grassy and you could enjoy a nice picnic. This is fun for all ages, and is not too much walking.Finding parking will probably be the worst part. If you can find a spot on the street you won't have to pay. To see the pits is free as it is outdoors. The museum requires a fee. The park is free and so is the active dig site.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BoobaFatt
50,highlight of our trip,if you are into prehistoric animals you have to visit the tar pits at first the smell of the tar is very unpleasant but you get used to it fast it is also right next to the museum and the garden area is beautiful,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T1445FWrachelw
40,Pleistocene Los Angeles!,"Even though I've lived in LA off and on for 10 years, I had never been to the tar pits. What a fun thing to do, especially for families. You can see tar oozing out of the grass in the middle of a park, check out the Page Museum and learn about mastodons and saber tooth cats, watch archeologists in action on site, and have a picnic in one of nicest parks around. There is a short 3D movie to orient you, and many skeletons and exhibits to give you a sense of the size of the mammals that roamed LA. It is a live dig site, a live geological site, and a really cool place, right smack in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WinecountryMartha
20,Only If You Have Time,"A co-worker told me not to bother visiting here, but we found ourselves close by, so why not cross it off the list?My co-worker was right.It’s basically a small pit of fenced-off, bubbling mud. There’s really nothing to see, which is probably why we found a parking spot (metered) so easily.If you’re in the neighborhood and just curious, go for it. If it’s going to cost you any time you may need, you can skip this with confidence.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adamr364
50,La Brea Tar Pits—A Must See!,"After hearing about the La Brea Tap Pits for decades, we finally got there as a family. Totally amazing! To think of animals being trapped in the tar for nearly 40,000 years, then see their reconstructed skeletons, was unbelievable. The signs in front of a number of the pits told what had been found there. In pit 9, over 10,000 fossils were recovered, including twelve-foot-tall, 11-ton Columbian Mammoths.Even on the grass where people play Frisbee, small fenced sections locate patches of tar and asphalt, and some patches outside of the fence.Though the tar and asphalt had been mined for use and profit for hundreds of years, identification of fossils did not begin until the late 1800’s. Serious mining and identification began in the early 1900’s.The George C. Page museum nearby contains a stunning display of discoveries in the pits. I have since read a book, and have two more on the way, about the discoveries.At one of the pits we watched work in progress as two men lifted a heavy section of tar and fossils in the process of discovery. The search in pit 91 continues each summer, painstaking exploration, inch by inch.Most of the displays can be viewed by anyone, though there is an admission charge for the museum and one other viewing area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JonDrury

20,Where is it?,"There was little to no signage to let me know where it was. It appeared to be a nice park beside the Art Museum. I finally asked a security guard where it was and he said, ""You are here."" I had seen, I thought, La Brea Tar Pits in movies, but what I found was just some scattered big puddles with fences surrounding them. The park itself is nice, but the pits are not much to notice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KarenJ770
50,Fascinating Museum!,I have wanted to go to the La Brea Tar pits since I was in elementary School in San Diego (that was a long time ago!).

I come here because it is an interesting local landmark with a lot of history and something to show family and friends that come and visit. It also shows the fascinating geology that the LA Basin represents.The Museum is impressive, though, I have to say, like the LA MNH, the mammals here need some restoration. The fur, or pho fur needs to be restored. Some of the exhibits are dated. No surprise here, this museum has been around since the 70's. The bones are spectacular, and the lab area is fascinating. They have a nice store where you can find some interesting items. The grounds are great, and interesting to walk. It is definitely a must see in the LA area, though, I wish they would spend some money and update their facilities.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/battmast

First of all I should say that besides an interesting exposition the museum has great staff - very young people who walk around and engage kids into exploration of the exhibits, asking some interesting questions which make kids think and showing some exhibits which can be touched.My baby daughter was attracted by the skeletons and moving stuffed animals despite her young age. The exhibition was interesting for my mum and me as well.Outside there's a marsh with gas bubbles where most of the bones were found. You can walk around the marsh and the pits, reading about the history of this place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anastasiag79
40,Interesting Bit of History,We spent about 90 minutes at the museum and looking at the tar pits combined. The tar pits are in a park located in western Los Angeles.

We also saw the 3D movie that gave more information and was quite interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/xena2542
50,One of those places you have to go to if you get the chance!,"You know, you hear about some place and never really see it but you get an idea of what it's about in your mind. Then the opportunity comes up to visit that place and reality sets in. For me I had envisioned this Grand Canyon of bubbling tar. In reality they have several 1-3 square yard ""Tar Pits"" with actual tar coming up from the ground in them, some bubbling. The museum is also worth a visit as it reveals the natural history of early Las Angeles as an area of oil wells. There still is a lot of oil to recover under the city and offshore as the rigs in the Pacific will testify. Right now in the museum there is the actual Space Shuttle Endeavor on display and is very much an item to take in. Stop in for an afternoon, it's worth the price of admission.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/691alanr

50,Enjoy pre-historic Los Angeles any day,Made a day of it here. We took our 14 year old grand daughter here. She said it was so cool to see dinosaur bones and the actual tar pits that they came from. We ate at the Los Angeles Farmer's Market after finishing up here. Great day of discovery.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/975lisal
50,So interesting!!,"I loved being able to see the tar pits around the ground, especially the small ones that were just fenced off. I think that stuff is so interesting. I thought it was so cool that you could see the scientists digging up the bones and cleaning them and identifying them. There are so many bones and fossils that they have found, and really shows such a huge part of the past. They are doing a great job and its very educational.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/344maryv
50,"Excellent, and Fun!","This must be one of the most under rated museums in LA! Come on, it's Ice Age Fossils folks. The museum itself is very well done and informative with a viewing area for watching scientists work. Outside, you can wander through tar pits and past archeological sites as well as current sites. There's also an excellent 3D movie called Titans of the Ice Age which costs a few more dollars. I almost passed, thinking why should I pay MORE, but it's well worth it. Very informative and fun 30 minute film. This is a great site for all, but especially kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marftrip
50,See LA Prehistory ...,"The Tar Pits Museum / Page is a nicely arranged and situated site in central Los Angeles on Wilshire Blvd. Tar pit park with lake and Mammoths / Mastedons is out front & you can walk around, even see tar still bubbling & smell it. Museum is built up on a knoll and has a magnificent collection of prehistoric animals & plants found in the tar pit excavations. Great exhibits and dioramas abound. Watch the info film. You'll enjoy, plus the LA County Art Museum is next door & Farmer's Market is a few blocks away. Spend a nice ½ day or full day in the area! ...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dblmed
40,"Amazing site, stinky too!","Fascinating natural phenomenon, where and when ice age animals perished into tar pits in the LA area... till today, methane gas is still being released causing ripples in Lake Pit. Tar can also be seemed bubbling to the surface. Lake area is scented with the smell of methane and tar. New fossils are still being discovered to present day. We didn't visit the museum, but spent time in the park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lowa88
40,Nice museum!,"I brought my family over the summer because I remember coming during a field trip in elementary school. The tarpits smell, like always haha :)FUN FACT: The La Brea Tar Pits.The - The (La) - Brea (Tar) - Tar - PitsLa means the and Brea means Tar.Its pretty much saying The The Tar Tar Pits haha :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GraiceC
20,Short trip to the tar pits,"Had a half day open, so I visited the Tar Pits. The park is open to public except for the museum. There's lots of parking in the street, especially in the back. Save $$ for parking. Nothing much to see in the museum. A 3D movie which made you sleepy and stuff creatures. Time line history was very interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChrisH8887
50,Awesome this place,"The way the scientists figured out this place was awesome.The place became a park in the heart os Los Angeles , near every where.Good experience see the dinosaurs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/301260hotelfun
50,Brilliant historical dig and presentation,"The tar pits (actually asphalt seepings) captured a plethora of animals from 14,000-55000 years ago. These included many extinct species like saber tooth cat, dire wolf, California mammoth and many others. The museum presents still active pits along with active digs and paleontological discovery. Staff is extremely knowledgable. A must!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hewitty15
50,It's NOT the Pits! It's great!,We always take all of our out of town guest here! They love it. Most people have never seen anything like this especially for it to be in the middle of the city. The museum is fabulous! Great for all ages. Good places to eat across the street.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TwoAdventure
50,recommended!,"Very well designed museum, that would be interesting to both kids and adults.We were a family for four, including two teens and all enjoyed it a lot. Younger kids may enjoy even more.The museum has exhibitions of fossils and models inside, and the actual pits outside. One of the highlights is a behind-the-glass fossil lab, where you can see the actual work of cleaning and sorting the fossils being done. Its a really great to get to know the process, in addition to the results.Tips:-- Make sure to visit the actual pits outside the museum.-- Avoid the lines inside and buy your ticket at the booth outside (on the way from the parking lot).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GC460
40,"""Nature can be cruel""",A visit to the La Brea Tar Pits can bring tears to your eyes when you think of how animals died in the area. The park is a show case of nature's gifts and also destruction.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/epuya
40,The museum is pretty good but I go for the goo.,See the museum. It is unique and pretty awesome but don't miss walking through the park. Keep your eyes peeled! There are tar pits coming up all over. You may have to hunt for some or they might be oozing up under your feet through the walkways! The place undulates! That is my favorite part of the whole place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Maddiesmelody
40,Nice to combine with the museums nearby,This is a nice place to spend a couple of hours (including watching the 3D movie). It will be best combining with a visit to any of the museums near by to make it worth your time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/freemaee
50,Interesting bit of history,"If you are interested in paleontology (as we are), the La Brea Tar pits provide a fascinating overview of early excavations juxtaposed with more current understanding. Younger children will enjoy the skeletons and panoramas presenting early animals, and there is enough history and science to engage anyone with a bit of interest.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gails386
50,"""Amazing""",We were on a tour which took us past the La Brea Tar Pits so the next day we drove back there and spent nearly day walking around watching the tar bubbling away in the lake the museum was interesting as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chezza312
40,Interesting place and story,This is a place to see at least once. The museum is not very big and the outdoor pit exhibits and interesting. It doesn't take much time to see everything. If you plan to see one of the movies plan about 2 hours in my opinion.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/g8trman
40,Small museum,"Outside tar pits are free to access and nice park to walk around. On site parking is $10. Page museum was very small and only took about 15-20 minutes to view it all. Thankfully our admission was free with our ASC museum pass. Otherwise, $12 admission would not be worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ncuff01
40,amazing place,"amazing to see all the stuff that has come out of the pits, really interesting and educational. The grounds are lovely too",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NZBunny
50,A very pleasant and informative visit.,"Professional, organized and enlightening as to the history of the area. Enjoyed the visual show and there were many volunteers offering additional advise when touring the exhibits. Well worth the USD32 total (2 adults entry @$12 each plus Titans of the Ice Age film @$4 each)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fussyminx
50,Interesting!,"Parking was $10 per car but the rest was interesting. Tons to do for free or you can pay to see the museum. Great signs explaining what happened on the site 10,000 + years ago. Hard to believe that so many wild animals roamed the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/UpstateNySimplyme
40,Love Hanging Out Here,"This is a great place to just hang out and get away from the madness of Los Angeles. Great little park area to relax under shady trees, available restrooms, nearby eateries and there is also the museum, which in my opinion, the entrance fee is a bit pricey. Overall, a pretty nice place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sanyikasooalo
50,an amazing must see attraction smack in the middle of LA,"Great for kids of all ages. So unique in the world to have access to such a plentiful exhibit of dinasour ruins. good parking in the area, free and its right next to the LA Museum of Art which is well worthwhile as well. A number of decent places to eat in the area that can be reached on foot so you can spend the day without moving the car.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pandpCalifornia
50,Would definitely go...,"This is a very interesting museum and we learnt a lot. We booked the three talks/shows - one too many in hindsight, We think the 3D ice age show and the outdoor walkabout would be enough. Very cool to see all the bones and well worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NiknakNZ
50,Nice trip to the past,Museum was small but interesting. The tar pits were really neat to see in the middle of L.A. Nice reminder and nod to the past. Had to park on the street because the parking lot was full.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/toshab379
50,Fascinating to Visit,"It's amazing to me that these tar pits exist right in the middle of Los Angeles! The tar pits have been there for thousands of years, and are still active and bubbling today. They are working geological digs, and you are able to see how the scientists are excavating and preserving their finds as you walk around the extensive grounds. But be warned that there is a definite smell that comes from the tar pits! The museum is wonderful, with prehistoric mammals on display and helpful guides located all around to answer any questions. My husband and adult son weren't too enthused when I said I wanted to visit here, but they ended up being just as fascinated by it as I was, and they thanked me for insisting that we see it. It's well worth a visit if you are in LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmyGNewJersey
50,Fasinating museum,"See all the prehistoric mammals and exhibits all laid out to a high standard. Very interesting to visit, looking at the tar pits where many a film has been shot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dallasc947
50,Amazing,It is a wonderful site that has be preserved with all the Hollywood craziness around it. A geological treasure that is still an active dig finding new fossils everyday.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/327margaretd
40,interesting museum and grounds,20 years ago I took my family here to see the tar pits and museum. I recently went back with an out of town guest and found the experience just as interesting. I like the extensive grounds around the museum as well as the active dig site you can visit. In the museum they have a nice and relatively short walk thru exhibit explaining everything. I recommend this for slightly older children and adults.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/martinkQ7630MZ
50,Interesting history,"My mother really wanted to make this visit. I said, ""okay, what ever you want to do"". Never really thought about visiting this place but really glad we did. It smelled, but we became used to it by the end of the trip. There wasn't really much to see except the tar pit and read up on some history. Walking around on the rooftop of the museum was nice, good views. I encourage anyone to visit if you are in the area. It is free and interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gretcheno546
40,Small but well done,"The tar pits themselves were interesting. The museum did a a good job showing what has been discovered, the history of the area, and the context of the discoveries.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/noonles
40,Visiting LaBrea,"It is amazing that there are still fossils in the tar at LaBrea. There are actual reconstructed bones that were found on the site, and an active site that still has fossils being found. Very interesting",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mommomb
30,Went so we could say we've seen it,"Interesting and definitely something you wouldn't find at home.Didn't pay to go in and see the museum.have seen it now, don't need to see it again",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/newycrystal
50,Interesting & Educational,"Thoroughly enjoyed our visit here, very educational and enjoyed learning about the Tar Pits. Enjoyed the 3D Ice Age Show.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Adi1811027
40,Magical experience,"My husband and I took our 12 year old son and he had a great time, and we also enjoyed the experience it is amazing to be able to see so close the tar pits, the saber tooths and all the expositions they have.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lully7710
40,Interesting History and Finds,"It's surreal to see large, ancient tar pits in the middle of a huge city.Nice maps in the park show where each of the larger tar pits are located.The main tar pit is quite large and still bubbling. The fence around the main pit has informational signs regarding the tar pit (why does it smell bad?), a timeline of the area, and some of the animals found in the pit (how big is a human compared to a Sabertooth tiger?).I really liked the museum's exhibits showing what the area was like in the past. It's amazing how many bones have been discovered and even more amazing that they continue to find more. I have never seen so many skulls in one display!Also has a nice gift shop, bathrooms, and a photo opportunity for your friends and/or family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wanderer_Jen
50,Prehistoric magic,Very interesting and reasonably priced. Would visit again. Friendly and helpful staff. Exhibitions are well thought out and the outdoor atrium is a lovely place for a respite. Not large but worth visiting,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmandaElizabeth62
30,Interesting,Connected to LACMA and Peterson Automotive Center so it would be nice to pay one admission for both. Enjoyed the visit and history.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/932lizam
50,Home of 500 Saber Tooth Cats,"A must see for the kids as this is home to all kinds of ancient animal bones who found their final resting place at La Brea and Wilshire blvd when they thought they would just stop by for a drink. Yes back about 60,000 years ago 500 saber tooth cats from Los Angeles County ended up in the tar pits here and that was when this one one tough neighberhood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tomrT3113SC
40,Head on over to the tar pits,"We spent an interesting couple of hours at the Brea Pits, we didn't go inside the museum which was $12 and seemed to showcase all the animal bones they had discovered but the outside areas are very interesting and it was great wandering around the tar pits themselves. There is a very strong smell of hot tar which I quite liked and some of the ground is very spongy which I guess is the tar just below the surface. You can look into an active excavation and you can see the animals that they are excavating, I have no idea how the guys excavating clean the tar of themselves at night. Its amazing to get an idea of what lived in this area in the past.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AucklandJonathan
50,"Learn what lived in the area many, many years ago","Well worth seeing. You can combine with the LA County Museum of Art and several of the other museums in the area. There are several pits and many are being excavated. Learn what was there and see how they do the excavation. You can also walk around the park and they have free concerts on Friday's, at 5 I think. The concerts are crowded so get there early and bring a picnic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/philetos
50,"affordable, steeped in the local animals and tar pits of another era.","affordable and family entertainment, includes outdoor strolling area around the tar pit, but is also awesome for adults to see. the indoor exhibit is affordable or free and moving to see posed animals like the saber toothed tiger. sizes of animals are impressive, too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mollyh620
40,A fascinating collection,"I'd recommend a trip to this museum. They have an abundance of ice age artefacts and the displays are incredibly informative. There are staff out on the floor with a handling collection and offering further insights.I thought the 3D movie was good and worth the extra fee. The bubbling primoridal lake outside isn't a mock up, it's real.Try and get on the excavator tour. Project 23 isn't an existing tar-pit excavation, more the ongoing work to excavate samples crated and shipped from elsewhere in LA some years ago.But the real reason I came to The La Brea Tar-pits was becuase I heard that La Brea means ""The Tar-pits"" making this the world's most tautological site:The The Tar-pits Tar-pits :-)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andrewhP8920EE
50,Watch the bones of extinct animals being cleaned,"We often take visitors this site and museum. They are awed by the fact that mammoths and saber tooth tigers once roamed what became Los Angeles. It is easy in warm months to find oily tar bubbling out of new holes in the grass. My husband, being a kid at heart, gets a stick and pokes it into new holes to draw out the tar. Once, we even found fresh tar coming out of a parking spot in a nearby paid parking area. We usually get a free or metered parking space on the street and walk to the park where there is a lake that bubbles sulfurous fumes.. Kids of all ages love the museum where they find out why so many animals, even birds, got stuck in the tar. The skeletons of many extinct victims of the pits are on display including a whole wall of dire wolf skulls. Give yourself at least two hours to view the site and museum and then plug your parking meter and walk to the nearby Marie Callendar’s for a great meal in a gorgeous setting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lindymiles
40,Fun Visit/Walk Through,Fun walk through in the late day/early evening to see some of the exhibits. Would certainly recommend walking through for anyone in the area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ofche001
50,Columbian Mammoth viewing,"I recommend signing up for the excavator tour. It's included in the fee and the guide provides a lot of extra bits of information. Inside the museum, there are many fossils which are very impressive. The best part for me was watching the volunteers cleaning the fossils. They have a sign posted as to what they are cleaning, plus a white board list of what skeleton they are finding parts for.They have many fossils on display, all from the pits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CAtourist
50,Interesting Sights & Smells at La Brea Tar Pits,"After seeing the tar pits in several movies and TV specials, I am delighted that I took time to visit. The Tar Pits can be visited for free, but parking at the LACMA parking lot is $12.While at the Tar Pits, a movie crew was shooting a film to be released next year (""Desert Rose"" is supposed to be the name). Who knows, you might be an extra in a movie as you learn about the geology of LA, extinct Mastadons and other fossilized remains found at the tar pits.Even if you've seen the tar pits, you may not realize the smells associated with them. Not bad, just didn't realize what the smells would be like.This is definitely recommended for any visit to Central LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lostnspace9
40,Way cool walk around...,We stopped here one afternoon after going to farmers market. It was after hours so museum was closed. This place is so worth a walk around and seeing the tar pits.Hard to imagine its right here in central LA but it has history and was mined for the tar and petroleum.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Summerasalifestyle
50,There´s more to discover at the La Brea Tar Pits & Museum,"Very interesting museum with 5 million fóssil from the past 55,000 years. Outside it´s possible to see historic pits, ongoing excavations, ice aged plants. Inside, La Brea Tar Pits Museum, Observation Pit, Archeological Laboatory and Gifts Store.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jemara_11
50,Awesome,"Was a beautiful day in LA, I was supposed to learn there is actually 4 main tar pits, interesting history, and a beautiful park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/royc174
40,Really weired to find this in Central LA,Whilst visiting the close-by LACMA - we took time out to walk around the Tar Pits (but did not have enough spare time to visit the Museum which would without doubt have been more interesting. A really strange place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BobandJosie
50,An amazing historic site,This is unlike any historic site I have ever before . I have visited the Colosseum in rome and many other pre BC places but this takes the biscuit ! And the fact that the tar springs are still there makes it a place to visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/255stevee
50,Great little piece of history!,"I only walked around the outside park area. Didn't have time to visit the museum. I was really impressed with the park. It was small, and I thought that it was a perfect size for walking around in hot weather. I only needed 1 hour max, and I was able to stop at all the different tar pits.Great spot for pre-historic enthusiasts! Wish I had more time to go to the museum. Will definitely go back!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iyeh
50,Excellent small museum for kids interested in dinosaurs,On hop on hop off bus route. One hour max. Quiet garden in middle of the circular building for a brief rest. Scientists working inside sorting tiny bones. Plenty of dinosaur skeletons to see. Don't miss the outside tar pit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/593susiev
30,"Yar Pits are interesting, but overrated","No dinosaurs, not much tar, just history in Los Angeles. Wish I could be up beat, but the tar pits are somewhat a waste of time compared to other attractions in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TonyFi18
40,Great place in the city,Spent a couple of hours here and found it very interesting. Reasonably priced with some concessions and not crowded at all. Was able to see the 3D movie for an extra $4 which really sets up the whole site visit. Its $10 to park but if you visit at weekends there is public parking lot opposite on the right which is $15 all day. That will then allow you walk to the farmers market about 1/2 mile away for refreshments and explore the grove.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/markdsn
50,Who Knew - Not for Kids only!,"I live in LA and had never been here! Family was visiting that had visited multiple times before so I had already brought them to many other of the LA points of interest. (These were all adults, no one under 35.) Since we were going to the Peterson Car Museum blocks away, we added the Tar Pits to our plans.I am NOT A DINOSAUR FAN, and typically prefer an art museum over natural history museum. How shocked was I . . all of us . . this was so great. We have all seen prehistoric footprints and fossils before - but not like this. Sadly (what a terrible way to go!), these prehistoric creatures were encased in tar so they remained basically intact. The amount they have unearthed, or should I say ""untarred"" is amazing and explained and displayed very well.You can see as they are still working on untarring more. They are truly doing this in their work areas (on view to us) when we are there. To bring the reality to the present. . . when we were walking across a lawned area, we had to watch our footing because the tar still bubbles up from the earth (and was!) It takes some time to go through, so although it is next to LACMA I would not recommend both on the same day. The Peterson Auto Museum is small enough to see the same day. (Also walking distance on Museum Mile.)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IreneDJ2
30,Quick 1 hour visit,I always read about the tar pits in books and saw on tv so when in LA i had to check it out. The museum is only about a 15 minutes to walk the entire thing and in about an hour you can visit the entire ground. There is an entrance fee which is surprising because all other museums in the LA were all free. However if you have an hour to kill definitely check it out.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/92mohammadr
50,Great attraction for young kids,"I visited the La Brea Tar Pits Page Museum with my 7 year-old. The museum is perfect for young kids curious about fossils, animals or natural science. If they're not curious about it, a trip to the museum may take care of that. We watched the 3D movie explaining why the pits are a great source for ice age bones, we took part on the ice age encounter with the sabre-toothed tiger pupped and then did the excavation tour. The museum is very complete and you can tell kids are excited and happy to be there. Highly recommended for a family trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pmaggiani
40,In the middle of the city!,"Who would have thouight that this cool museum would be right in the city? Nice displays, annual membership also includes LA Museum - excellent value.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/munstah
50,Dinosaurs Still Visible,It's super cool how the tar pits are still left untouched and exposed to be viewed as they were millenia ago. Best part is that there are still fossils sticking out of the tar pits. Great for kids and families.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/736TimB
50,Interesting Place,I recently had the pleasure of joining one of my children on a field trip here and then returned with my other two kids two weeks later. It's amazing to think in the middle of Los Angeles palaeontologists are still finding fossils from the most recent Ice Age.The museum has an outside section to visit as well as the inside. The inside of the museum is not that large so the entire museum is doable in a couple of hours. You can easily return and learn something new the second time around.A great time to visit the museum is during school months on the first Tuesday of the month when it is free. I did pay for us to watch the 3D movie and found it to be very informative.Note: the only food sold at the museum is out of a vending machine or in the gift shop. However the La Brea Tar Pits does have beautiful grounds for having a picnic. There is food in walking distance if you wanted to purchase food.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rwheeler1977
50,Who doesn't love seeing how dinosaurs really perished...,"Growing up this was one of my favorite places to visit. From the amazing elephants stuck in tar portraying what would have happened millions of years ago to walking around the fossils inside the museum, this is a unique dinosaur museum in Los Angeles. If you have little ones, they can also roll down the landscaped grass mountain... (they love it)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrBalan11
50,"Educational, fascinating for the archaeologist in each of us","The La Brea Tar Pits is a active archaeology dig site with a museum and active tar pits that have been there at least 40,000 years. La Brea (which means tar) has been there for 40,000 years. It has some of the best fossils for mammoths and the largest fossil collection of carnivores.I would not recommend going unless you have time to see the museum, the 3D show, and the tour. The museum is small, but very well layed out. It will take about 30-45 to walkthrough. A few interactive items for small children. We went on a busy weekend, and they had personnel there who could answer questions in every room with a fossil that the kids could touch and feel. They have a famous ""fish bowl"" where archaeologists are actively separating small dirt into insects, dirt, bones and shells. They have one with a TV so you can see the small objects. Then the have an area where you can try yourself.The 3D show explains the history behind the tar pits and the era of animals that are in the fossils. The show runs about every 30 min, and is approx. 20 min long. The tour then takes you to the Observation Pit (which is the only way to see this). And then explains the Project 23 (which took out 23 boxes of tar pits out of underneath the neighboring art museum to put in a underground parking garage) and the site 91 (active tar pits that are being excavated in place). The tour took about 45 minutes all walking and standing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zlch0c
40,It's Right There,"My daughter was driving, thank goodness. She now lives in downtown LA, but had never visited La Brea Tar Pit. I assumed it would be way off the beaten path, yet it's right on Wilshire. Downwind one breathes the smell of a newly paved parking lot. Realistic elephants are about to meet their fate on one edge of the shiny black pond. The site offers plenty of learning opportunities. We were surprised to find a bubbling up of tar under the shade of a tree in a grassy area near the public museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sanmigueleno
30,Well thorough museum of fossils and recreations.,"A lot of interesting things to see outside the museum for free. But if you're really into the history of this, worth it to check out the museum at least once. Very thorough, fossils, statues, even watching people at work as they examine recent discoveries and explanations of how they do it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YEthanO
50,2nd Visit,"I have lived my entire life in Southern Ca. This was only my second visit to this museum. I love going there. Lots of history, ranging from ancient animals, the Spanish land grants, right up to today's use of the area. Outstanding presentations. I enjoyed watching the material being sorted for tiny fossils.next visit I hope to get a model of the Dire Wolf skull for my desk!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/10ringtraveler
50,Free if you don't go in the museum,"Very cool place! Interesting museum and the tar pits, which are still being excavated, are accessible. Lots of school groups when we were there but still worth the trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/809CarolineM
50,It's the Pits & You'll Love It ....,The Pits / George Page Museum is the tip area of an asphalt / tar seepage that trapped prehistoric animals & plants & was once an oilfield boom town of yore. The museum is an educational treasure for all ages. The diorama out front is a classic ....,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dblmed
50,Smells like Tar,"When you first walk in the gate you smell the tar. The tar lake is to the left and still bubbles. It is amazing that they have found more and more bones in these pits, and are not done yet. The movies are great for both adults and children, and very informative. The museum is small but fantastic. This is a great place to take the kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobertD90
50,An LA Must-See.,Spent a couple of hours wandering here recently and it far exceeded our expectations.The exhibits are life-like and arresting and really get your imagination going.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trishb764
40,There really weren't Tar Coated Dinosaurs,"The Tar pits and museum are a great showcase of natural history. Though people hawk souvenirs of dinosaurs and there are posters in the area, they really did not stem from the time of the tar pits. The museum adjacent to the pits tells the whole story. The bulk of your time will be spent at the museum, but it will be worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ColConnie
40,Interesting place.,Great place for all familymembers. We only found this place by chance. It is a pitty that it almost disappears in all the usual Hollywood glitter.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GrandTour79034
40,Nice place for a walk. Interesting to see the actial dig site.,"We visited on a hot day and still enjoyed the walk around the tar pits. I loved seeing the dig site although no one was working when we went. We didn't go into the museum, but managed to go into the LA Art Museum. I guess we got a little lost. But we enjoyed that also.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Betszeglin
50,love the Sabre tooth cats,"loved the cats, and the shows, also free entry if you become a member of the museaum of natural history, a must for a family visiting LA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StratosMoutafis
30,Interesting,The fossils are interesting. It is a very good place to visit if you are into dinosaurs and stuff. My main reason to go was to see the active tar pit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RW60s
40,Must see for anyone in the oil business!,"We went to the tar pits on our way out of town at my husband's request. The pits and the archeological exhibits were very interesting! We parked in the lot and took a walk through all the natural pits and the courtyard of the museum. We did not go into the full museum due to time constraints. Based on what we saw, we will budget more time to see the full museum and neighboring art museum next time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TMitch84
40,For Kids and Adults,"The tar pits continues to fascinate my husband who visited over 15 years ago, so we had to go again. Lots of things to see, learn and do for kids and adults. Do not got on a hot and humid day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Route66travel
50,Discover history in the pits,The La Brea Tar Pits and museum is a great place for families to learn a little history uncovered in the tar pits of LA. Kids really love it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lkstumm
40,A sightseeing classic,"Although we have all heard about the La Brea Tar Pits in school, what struck me the most when I first arrived was the smell of tar. The place smells like fresh asphalt.When walking through the park, we saw places where tar was oozing out of the ground - places where new pits will eventually form.The park is FREE to walk through, but there is a fee to walk through the museum, which I thought was too small for the price. If I had it over to do, I would have walked through the park and skipped the museum. Nevertheless, I am not disappointed about paying the price.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Old-Socialist
30,Will kill a morning,"Paid to see the 3D Titans of the Ice Age show - that was cool, although goes a little off key at the end. The museum itself is only small, can take half an hour to see it all. You can watch people cleaning/sorting the bones which have come up from the tar and there are usually people wandering about with replicas to show you.The tar pits outside are still bubbling away, there were two active digs you could go and watch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RooskieDoosk
50,Free on some days,We lucked out that it was free when we visited. I donated $10 and paid for the 3D show. The kids enjoyed the visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fojas
50,Nice,It's a great place to take the three-year-old and let him run around and burn energy off while looking at dinosaurs .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/41davidK
50,So Interesting!,"My husband and I were staying in Hollywood and had a free afternoon to visit the Tar pits. Overall, so interesting and educational. The two shows we saw were very good, even the one geared more for children.It was amazing to see the tar (asphalt) bubbling up out the ground and all the bones of different animals they recovered from the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/8cats
50,LA as it was before the last ice age,"Certainly the most surprising attraction along LA's miracle mile.While the sprawling city has built up around this site in a little over a hundred years the open tar pits are in precisely the same location where they first bubbled to the surface 40,000 years ago. The pits themselves remain every bit as sinister as they must have looked to the countless animals that have blundered into their sticky trap since prehistoric times. Their unfortunate demise however, has presented scientists, historians, and the general public with a wealth of preserved skeletons including many of long extinct creatures.The Page Museum on the site displays many of the most impressive finds and provides a fascinating experience for visitors, including 3D films, tours of the ongoing excavations, and my own highlight, an observation lab where you can watch curators carefully revealing more exhibits. Admission free on the second Tuesday of every month.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Belgo96
40,A good place for a short visit,"We visited the Tar Pits because we a huge Harry Bosch fans (Michael Connelly books), and these are mentioned in a few of them. Nice place to make a short visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pippin1960
50,Cool,Seeing the active pits where they are harvesting fossils and bones were really cool. There was lots of dinosaur bones. The people were real nice. The big pit is still bubbling.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/doreenl835
50,It's alive...............,Great place to take out of town visitors. The active tar pit is stunning. You can smell and see other bubble ups on the property. The only place outside of St Croiux you will be able to see an active tar pit. I always think the dinosaurs are moving. Are they?,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FoodieinNOHO
50,A Walk Down Ancient Trails,We were fascinated by the life like ancient animal statutes. The short articles explaining the life of the animals was educational. Enjoyed the animal-tronic show of the animals preying on each other for a food source. The gigantic size of the animal statues made glad I did not have to battle them in their time!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adlinem2015
50,Fab time at a great museum,Something for the whole family- great museum and grounds layout alongside LACMA. Fascinating and amazing history of the local LA area and creatures. Note- visit on the 1st Tuesday of the month- entry is free!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mm-at-large
40,"Cool, nature's magic","It's a must see, also good place for walks / run ! You have ample parking space, good for kids, refreshments available, museum timings to be always kept in mind, happy exploring ! Cheers",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/prakashm192
50,So glad I returned,"I visited the Tar Pits when I was a kid. We decided to bring our boys and revisit. It was a great experience, I remembered somethings and there were other things I didn't remember at all. It is very educational and a very special spot right in LA. There is so much information and history here. Everyone should visit at least once. You will be amazed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bsmith6
50,Informative installations in the museum,"I very much liked to watch the scientists considering stones and parts of bodies of animals, insects under a microscope. It was like Paleontology Laboratory. Mammoths, saber-toothed cats - all this bewitches and gives feeling that you appeared during that era when there lived these animals. And a lot of exotic palms around the building , beautiful park. I recommend this place for children and parents who is interested in history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/217ingam
40,Tar Pits!,"Very interesting. Took my kids and my nephew. Learned about the dinosaurs. The kids had a great time, and it was fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/556shaunar
50,This is a fun place for everybody,This is a fun place for everybody. The kids love the dinosaurs and the tar simulator. I was fascinated by the past and knowing it is right here in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/698jasonm
40,A live part of history in our own back yard,"I grew up a few mile from the tar pits in the miracle mile area and went to not far away, we had field trips a few times a year and it was alway a joy seeing were the dinosaurs migrated, so awesome to see a live part of history in our own back yard were a theTar erupted.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melbeanye
30,Expensive but worth a look,"One of our must dos on the trip to LA, the Le Brea tar pits and museum were visited just prior to closing.10 bucks to park and 24 bucks for entry for two adults to the museum was more than expected, but certainly worth a look. Once inside the exhibits were well set out but more sparse than expected, souvenirs a little on the expensive side and outside the tarpits are open to 10pm and rate a ho hum from me as the large pool is active but the walk around the gardens revealed fenced areas with little more than a couple of sticky pools and not much else, although well kept.Now that I've been and seen it, I wouldn't revisit again unless the kids were with me next time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bobs922
30,Passing by and stopped to look in.,We had a brief visit at the Tar Pits and inside. It was okay and there was lots of reading material and artefacts preserved. Also a 3d theatre showing the ice age narrated by Christopher Plummer. Might have been better if we had been a family though.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hwnew
50,Dont miss this,"amazing place.Have been to LA twice and did not even know this place existed, Spent a few hours just checking every thing out.very interesting,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/878jan
40,Neat Place To See,"This place was a great stop. Lots of interesting information over fossils and great museum. The grounds are awesome to wonder around. If you have not seen it, it is worth a view at least once.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Beach_Life74
50,Tar - riffic!,"Very good place to visit for anyone interested in natural history, geography, geology or simply in nature. Great exhibits of fossils - in this case meaning real bones and skeletons spat out by the adjacent tar pits. A great intro movie at extra charge really provides the context you need.You can look in the laboratory at scientists working on recovered material and you can visit external pits outside where other work sorting through large ""tree planters"" of tar is taking place.Don't miss a visit to the large tar pit itself with a wonderful oily smell and large bubbles of gas emerging from the sticky liquid that has trapped millions of animals down the millenia.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dannymcl
50,Fascinating but not glamorous,This is a really interesting and wierd out of place location right in the heart of the urban landscape of Los Angeles. there is a museum where they exhibit the many fossilized remains of ice age creatures that have been recovered from the natural formation known as the tar pits. Definitely recommend a walk through the park and the museum for anyone who is interested in natural history.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ramblinmanm
30,Educated visit,Need more signage for walking tourist to get there cos' some of locals were not even aware of its existence. There is a pit just outside the Museum and still bubbling of sulphur and crude oil. Good education for kids of the Ice Age animals that are now extinct.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kosing2015
50,The Ice Age begins to come alive at the museum and excavation sites...,"Here you will see fossils of predators and prey alike trapped in the asphalt starting about 55,000 years ago.(On the tour you will learn why it's mostly predators.) It's fascinating to be able to watch the fossils being prepared in the fossil lab. There is a fair amount of walking on the Excavator tour, but it takes you into the original pit museum as well as walking past seepage areas where you can observe the same process of entrapment by asphalt going on today with leaves, sticks, and, we were told, an occasional small animal. One Ice Age human female was found and a few modern humans have almost been trapped before the fencing was put up.If someone in your group is sensitive to chemical odors you should know there is the smell of asphalt throughout the grounds, but not inside the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/claireleefl
40,Stick Around at the La Brea Tar Pits,"This is a great place to visit for those that love fossils and natural history. This is NOT a place about dinosaurs! You will see mammoths, sabre tooth tigers and more. The La Brea Tar pits are ages old and are still being actively excavated. You will see tons of bones and fossils retrieved from the area. You can also see them working an active dig. Inside the museum you can watch technicians cleaning and working with materials. The Ice encounters movie is well done and worth viewing. The excavating was tour was good but not great. If you can time it, it is worth getting a good overview of the property and it is the only way to see the original excavation area. Then you can see the places you missed or revisit them on your own. This was one of the highlights of our vacation in LA. Warning, be ready for the extended smell of asphalt!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EndlessCaravan
50,Interesting way to spend an hour or 2,"The museum is quite interesting (a little outdated perhaps, but I think that gives it some of its charm). There are plenty of bones: mammoth, mastadon, sloth, smilodon, camel, bison, dire wolf, etc (but no dinosaurs, btw). There are animatronic creatures, a theater, and an area where you can watch people cleaning fossils. There is also a nice atrium with tropical plants and a koi pond.The tar pits themselves aren't extremely fascinating. They jazzed it up with some statues of mammoths, but otherwise it's essentially a brown pond that smells like asphalt.There is plenty of parking, but you have to pay for it. There is also a decent gift shop, if you're into that sort of thing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RachelS1689
50,A must see in LA,"La Brea Tar Pits and Page Museum are fascinating. We visited the museum and took advantage of the walking tour, which I highly recommend. The sheer volume of artifacts found at the site is amazing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnneLovesTravel
50,"Great historical value, a must visit.","We found ourselves fascinated before we even visited this location from movies and documentaries. But when we visted it did not disappoint. To see it in person along with that murky tar pool really makes you think about how the area looked back in the stone age. The museum on campus complete with bones fished out the tar pits is a great find. But if you ever searching for this area, just follow the smell of tar and it will lead you right to it. Great place to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/torresconsultinggrof
50,La Brea,We were very lucky that our friend is a volunteer at the La Brea tar pits and Museum. We saw the sites that are still being excavated and the ones that have produce thousands of fossils. It was fun to watch the volunteers sorting through the lastest finds.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joselynp62
50,Very interesting and informative,"We went to the La Brea Tar Pits and Museum today by default. We intended to go to the Los Angeles Museum of Modern Art but upon arrival found they were closed on Wednesdays. But not the Tar Pits and Museum next store. They have pull thousands of specimens from the tar pits including many species that no longer exist. The museum is entirely self-guided but easy to follow. Cost is $13 for adults, $9 for seniors and students.Parking is $10.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/914glenv
50,Tons of fossils and bones,There is a fee and then there is extra tours that you can purchase. It was very interesting and we are glad we did the extras. Pretty amazing this all occurred in present day downtown Los Angeles.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barbarasusanc
40,"Interesting museum, both inside and outside","Such a cool history; interesting to see the fossils and learn about how the tar pits came to capture all of those pre-historic animals. I didn't go on the tour, but was nice to walk around the museum inside and then to go outside and see the pits and fossil digs themselves.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RP3x454
40,Fun hour in LA!,"We had a late flight out of LA so decided to visit the La Brea Tar Pits after it was recommended to us - was quite interesting to learn some of the history of LA. We were lucky enough to have free admission on a Tuesday but I would have been happy to pay the $12. Very educational and I would recommend it for people of all ages, especially kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kirstalina
40,Fun couple of hours in downtown LA,"Arrived in LA for a few days and made out first stop the tar pits. Didn't really know what to expect but that being said, was very interesting and 'cool' (per my son). You can walk around outside for free but we wanted to learn more and go inside the museum, this is s paid attraction. We were entitled to free admission due to reciprocating membership we have at our local science center. As it turns out, it was the first Tuesday in September so was free admission anyway. We explored the exhibits and inside presentations. They was a live presenter literally every turn inside the museum - from skulls to the lab where they were cleaning fossils. There is a lovely outdoor garden in the middle of the museum which was lovely. We then toured outside to see the pits that have and are being explored.Worth the couple of hours to see how most of the world once was!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tber
40,History in the heart of Los Angeles,"Had heard a little of this place before and had visited the park a few years back but was encouraged to take the kids (13, 10 and 6) along for a look in the museum.Museum is well laid out and does a great job of presenting the range of finds and the history of the area from ice age to modern era. The fish bowl area where you can watch palaeontologists work sifting through material is fascinating and really different. There are a number of informative films but the main one is a 3D presentation of the history of the tar-pits - what the are, how animals got trapped, excavations etc.We had limited time so we rushed it a bit but 3 hours is probably about right if your kids are relatively curios - some of it went a bit over my 6 year olds head as it was difficult with 3 kids to give her the explanation she probably required in the short-time available.The park outside is worth a stroll and in many ways this might be a better starting point and possibly would be adequate if you had limited time.Missed the dedicated car park so spent $20 in 'Public Parking' opposite rather than $10. Entry fee was probably about right - especially if we had had more time to take one of the tours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/746philipe
50,"Free is always good, but this is well worth the normal admission.","We happened to hit a ""Free First Tuesday"" day to visit, which was a nice bonus. We helped them make up their loss of revenue at the gift shop. As you approach, the smell of tar is in the air. There was even tar oozing through a sidewalk across the street in front of the businesses there. I've never felt such a sense of authenticity at a museum before. You are right there at the place you learned about in school many years ago. And, this is history in progress, as you see the pits where they are still removing specimens. The museum and exhibits, indoor and out, are excellently done. Don't miss this one!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bobscof1
40,Worth a stop,"It is a fascinating stop in the middle of LA, and a total contrast from anything around. The park outside is interesting but make sure you visit the Museum itself. Very worthwhile and the skeletons are amaziy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/952leeh
40,Cool visit,"Tar pits which trapped hundreds of animals 15- 25,000 years ago. It was cool walking around natural history among the high-rises of LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/958gregorys
50,A Quiet and Interesting Part of LA,Loved going to the Pits and Museum. It was quite a pleasant little find in the middle of the bustling city. It wasn't crowded. The museum is very well done. The tour guide was very knowledgeable about the site. It doesn't take long to see it but it was well worth the time. It is still a working are too. Got to see lots of fossils and watch people who were sorting parts of the finds. Don't walk near the cones as these are areas where the asphalt is continuing to rise to the surface. Walked across the street to eat a wonderful lunch at Callendar's,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Trece95
50,Unique Experience,"The La Brea Tar Pits are an interesting natural landmark. If you have some time, it is worth a look around. There is a small parking lot for a $10.00 fee or you can park for free around the outside of the park. There is a museum for a fee, check their website for prices. There are several Tar Pits fenced off and even a active excavation going on that you can observe. We didn't have time to do the museum, but heard it was interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CARRA116
30,Presnted beautifully,"It was a very hot day and it is a walk to the museum even from a disabled parking space. Luckily there were wheelchairs for my disabled husband inside.It isn't cheap to visit and compared to other attractions is quite expensive. To be fair my husband loved this place, me and my daughter weren't so sure as it seemed quite a narrow subject although being able to see artifacts being cleaned was quite cool.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TrudyO179
40,A must see if you have plenty of time on your hands.,"We only had time to view the outdoor Tar Pits (free of charge) and the lobby of the museum. We would have liked to see it in its entirety but we had limitied time that day. However, the actually tar pits alone are worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/megan_Bocean
40,Interesting,"The grounds were well maintained with several small tar pits and one large pit. During our brief tour to the Project 23 area, our guide was very informative explaining how the animals were found and why they were so well preserved. We then had an opportunity to ask questions of one of the scientist excavating fossils at the site. They have discovered remains from wire wolves, camels, mammoths, sabre-toothed cats, turtles, etc.It was a fun and informative visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SusanV711
40,Intersting history,Great place to visit - animals stuck in tar over the years.Excavations are live and the tar is still escaping around the area.Pay the extra for the museum.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andimate
20,More hype than excitement,"Had heard many times about this place and finally got to visit. A bit of a let down - not sure what we expected, but it wasn't that. It's a small park that is reasonably historically interesting - but is replete with horrific parking, poorly mannered crowds, trash/debris around the area and not a lot else to do. Be advised of a strong petroleum odor (to be expected), but it may bother some visitors.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LSUTraveller
50,Great place for an outing with the grandchildren,This is the second time we've taken our grandchildren to the La Brea tar pits. They were absolutely fascinated with learning about prehistoric bones and where the dinosaurs once lived. Stayed outside for several hours. Enjoyed visiting the museum. Very educational.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeffcherylf
30,Interesting for sure,"Never been, so we decided to check it out. It is definitely more than a smelly hole in the ground, though the smell can get strong at times. The museum is short and sweet, and the different sites are worth checking out. Not an all day trip for sure. I think we got in and out in a little over an hour. Just right.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BLDRCO
40,Great visit,We chose to.Just walk the outer grounds and read about this extraordinary place. It's a 30 minute bus trip.from downtown and well worth a visit. It is amazing to see tne tar bubbling from the underground oil field a 1000 feet below. They have a set up showing how the mammoth were caught in the tar and could not escape. We also saw a dig underway at one of the pits which gave us an insight into the work involved to excavate these fossils. Didnt pay the extra for the museum but looked busy and.would possibly enhance your experience. A place to definitely visit if in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mandm298
50,Worth a visit!,"We had a great time here. Our kids were entertained for several hours outside and then we all enjoyed the museum. It was a small museum which was interesting to us, our kids, and their grandparents. It is nicely done and informative. I thought it was worth the price of admission and can't wait to go back. Restrooms are clean. We parked on the street. Topped it off with a fabulous lunch at The Counter which is a short walk away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kh795
50,Awesome day outing,"Driven by this so many times and didn't even realize it was where it was. ""La Brea"" should have given it away but it was a nice surprise to find it right next to LACMA. Parking was $10, entry for adults was $12.50 each which includes a tour of the exhibit, free tour outside lead by the most knowledgeable and passionate guides. One could tell she simply loved what she does (the name escapes me, I'm sorry. However with so few employees actually hired on, I doubt it would be hard to get her as your guide). There was an admission price that included a short video but we opted out of that. Amazing to see the meticulous and time consuming scientists working behind the glass and also to see all the bones they were able to uncover of saber tooth, mammoths, horses, etc was amazing to see up close and personal. Loved every moment and being fascinated with the recreations and depictions of extinct animals. Felt like a kid again!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kanicon
40,La Brea tar pits tell earth's history,"The La Brea Tar Pits is the only site where this type of study of prehistoric bones is conducted (with the exception of one small site in CA, apparently). You can walk back in time when you see the exhibits at this museum. There are reconstucted skeletons of many animals - the tusks are the only artificial parts because they are so heavy. There is a short video ($) that gives you a history of the area, helping you understand the significance of the tar pits. There is a room that everybody can see into where there are large and small bone samples being investigated by enthusiasts who are separating tiny bones under a microscope. Exhibits were mainly for display and where not interactive. We also went on an outside guided tour of a few existing tar pits, one of which had paleontologists working at a pit. This is a highly informative an educational activity that I would recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/113rl
50,"Yes Virginia, there were Mastadons here!","Terrific Interactive museum to thrill the young ones and visitors! Sabertooth tigers are among the many animal species found in the 'pits. Go ahead ... You can't help yourself... Bend done to the grass near the fence along the tar pits, and touch the black ooze. Then spend the rest of the day trying to get the stick stuff off!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NancyOandOscarO
50,Fascinating glance into pre-history,"I love that in the middle of 3 days of theme parks, we could easily dip into a well researched and presented display of ice-age history. The tar pits ensnarled ice-age animals and plants, and then preserved them beautifully for modern examination.The staff where enthusiastic about sharing their work - we saw a 10,000 year old stick that had just been pulled from the tar and looked like one in my garden.Thank you La Brea for sharing a love of science and the earth, and adding real depth to our LA holiday.(I understand that in a few months the purple metro line will go to La Brea, so this will make access even easier.)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kimandzanoor
40,Wonderful,Fun and interesting information. We took time to walk around outside and see all the pits and recommend you take advantage of the trees for the shade if it’s hot (it really helped us from getting sunburned the day we were there). Plan on spending some time if you really want to take in the place. There is so much to see and read about but it is worth it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/258donnac
50,Amazing place to learn and explore,Awesome place in the middle of Los Angeles. Learn about the ice age and see animals trapped in the tar pits. Look at the scientist working there live.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/librafrogner
50,Tar in Tinseltown?,"Located in Hancock Park on Wilshire, open 9:30 to 5 daily, except New Years, Fourth of July, Thanksgiving and Christmas. Tickets to the George C. Page Museum range from $12-19. Walking around the tar pits is free. Few people realise or remember that the entire Los Angeles basin floats atop multiple pools of oil and gas. When I was a child in the 1950s I distinctly remember oil well derricks on Signal Hill close to Long Beach airport, and in Huntington Beach! You can still see isolated wells dotting the Greater LA area, and they had to stop subway construction several years ago due to methane gas seepage! At this particular spot, fossils such as sabre tooth tigers, mammoth and others mix with hydrocarbon tar, producing a collection of perfectly preserved fossils. In addition bacteria consuming a small quantity of the tar seeping to the up produce methane gas which bubbles to the surface, giving the impression of the tar 'boiling' (which it most certainly does not). The museum is well worth it, with a chance to view their lab, actual excavation in the pits, talk to experts roaming about through the exhibits and of course the exhibits themselves. There is also a great movie which gives perspective to the place. And if you are really lucky, you may see a movie or TV crew in the pits area of the park shooting scenes - the pits have been in many a movie and on many a TV episode! There is plenty of free parking before 4 pm on the surrounding streets, or you can park under the Museum for $10. There are a pair of fantastic restaurants nearby, just east on Wilshire: Marie Callendars just across the street and IHOP a block east of Callendars. There are also picnic benches in Hancock Park. My advice however is to get in your car, go west on Wilshire one block to Fairfax and turn right. Los Angeles' Original Farmers' Market will be on your right, just past Hancock Park Elementary School - see my review called 'the Original Food Court'. Or you could continue north on Fairfax a further few blocks and eat at either Canters Deli or Schwartz bakery (separate reviews for each). These are Los Angeles' very yummy answers to Katz's Deli in New York City! Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/etweeden
50,Excellent!,"We went to the tar pits after seeing it in our guide book and then remembering that it has been in a couple of films set in LA. We are glad we did! The outside area with the pits is free (although the parking was $10), but I would really recommend paying the entry fee (I think it was something like $7) to go into the museum. This is due to the fact that the museum is good but you can go on a free tour with someone who works at excavating the fossils with the entry fee. This was a real highlight. Our tour guide (I want to say that his name was Philip, but I might be wrong) was absolutely wonderful. He pointed things out to us as we walked around the area, and had some very entertaining facts, stories and pictures which brought the tour to life. This made it a fantastic experience and possibly the best thing we did in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/873AmyB873

50,I enjoyed it.,"Allow 2 or 3 hours to see the museum and the tar pits.Its very interesting and unique.It is very close to Hollywood BLD also, so you do not have to go way out of your way to see it.If you have a rental car its easy to find a park closeby.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Greatwhite7
40,Fascinating and strange all at once,"It blows my mine that LA is Judd Clampett country. I had to see this for myself. it's a bit on the stinky side but super fun, none the less to watch the earth change right in front of you. I wonder how long it will be until Shell steps in to drill for crude.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JanetMcE
50,Amazing worth it!,"Visited from England and from entering the museum the staff were incredibly helpful and knowledgable. Firstly we did the cinema screening, then watched the fossil lab talk followed by the excavator tour and finally the tour of the mammoth, sloth and wolves. Excellent afternoon spent and even had time for a browse of the gift shop before closing. Worth a visit while in LA to see the work they're doing and incredibly educational!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Paige1804
40,Unique and most unusual environment to be seen.,Who'd have thought this could exist in the middle of a city! The La Brea Tar Pits are an anomaly like non other. I was shocked to have read the history of the area with the discovery of oil and how the tar pits were discovered and used. I am enthralled by the number of fossils and remains discovered in this most unusual place on earth. You must go! Take the kids as it is such an educational opportunity. In the event the museum is closed the park remains open. Take your time and enjoy the experience of the bubbling ponds of tar to the sulferous smells emulating from the bowels of the earth. Imagine what still remains underground beneath your feet.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GVWStonegate
40,Pretty neat.,"Pretty cool free place to explore. My younger boys loved it. Smells of tar - yes, it's really tar. Pretty grounds surrounding and lots of informative exhibits. Good way to kill about an hour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BethChicago
40,Interesting,The tars pits are interesting but under whelming the museum is nice with all the fossils they found in the tar pits nice stop for an hour or so,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Leslie331
50,NO DINOSAURS? WHAT?,"Yes that's true, these are Saber tooth tigers and mammoth, bison, giant sloths etc. From 15,000 years ago. I loved this place, going back in time all while surrounded by glitzy L.A. Like me you will learn a whole lot and leave smarter.Street parking all free until 4, make sure you read the signs as some places require residence pass to park. Or pay 10.00 and park under museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sandie02
50,Great History!,Loved This!!! Haven't been here since I was a kid and was so happy to bring my kids this summer! Very inexpensive and so cool! Take your time as the inside is not very big but there are many exhibits to look at and read about!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/saracO6334UU
40,museum adjacent to a working archeological site,A fascinating trip back in time to end of the last ice age. A huge collection of fossils from animals trapped in the tar pits at the end of the last ice age. Excavation and fossil discovery still goes on today,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dw221a
40,Worth a visit,"Very interesting location. The tar is fenced off but its worth a visit to see this unique site in the heart of Los Angeles. As you walk through the park, you can see tar bubbling up in unexpected places. The museum gives valuable information as to the origin of the pits and history of the area. I recommend a visit to this cool spot",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christinaa460
40,Interesting site,"Didn't have time for museum, but the pits are interesting. Great smell!! Plenty of signs explaining what you are seeing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BatGuano30
50,A Must-See in LA,"This was a great excursion - right in the center of downtown! The 3D movie is excellent, the exhibits are well done, the ""experts"" staged around the museum were a nice touch, and the excavation areas were extremely interesting. If you can free up an hour and a half, you can do it all for a very reasonable price. Highly recommended!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Euell
40,Very interesting,We did not realise that actual tar pits would be here. We did not visit the museum but looked around the site. Very interesting.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PaulaF699
50,Worth the time to spend at the Tar Pits marvel at the history and mother nature,"What an experience, visited the Tar pits last year came back again this trip had to visit again due to .fascination of nature",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christinecO7889FG
30,Interesting Site,"We didn't go to the museum, just wanted to see the tar pits. It was very interesting to see tar bubbling out of the ground in the middle of LA. Park on the street and save yourself ten dollars. There is a museum but it was pricey so we didn't go in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tpitboy
50,From school field trips to general interest - be sure to visit this famous location.,"I have been to the La Brea Tar Pits many times over the years, the most recent time was when an out of town relative was visiting LA from outside of the U.S. The actual tar pits are just as fascinating as they were years ago when, as a little girl, I visited there on school field trips. While I do enjoy all of the native history, I also love the early photos of Los Angeles and surrounding areas before they were overly developed into the bustling metropolis that we know today. It's interesting to see how acres of sprawling land, orange groves and ranches were transformed by developers into one of the most well known and well loved cities in the world.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RajiR_12
30,Museum with fossils,The tar pits themselves outside are not much to look at. THe museum which you pay for has a lot more information and it was interesting to listen to the talk about the Mammoth. There is so much amazing stuff though in LA I would probably not go back here. There are so much better ways to spend your time. We spent about an hour in the museum as the IMAX film was not available. One word of warning it is much cheaper to park around the outside in the streets rather than using the official car park.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/833justinc
40,History made entertaining in the heart of Los Angeles,"It's easy to find. Parking across the street. Lovely grounds with staff around telling you about the place. Inside watch the videos, they bring everything to life. You can sort fossils and see the outdoor small garden. The excavation is on site. I wish we had done that too! 2 of us really liked it. 2 of us were non plussed but I bet the info learned will live in all of us! Provides a nice foil to the commercial side of LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IPI6869
40,Super Interesting and Very Educational,"We took our nine year old here for a few hours on a Sunday morning. The outside grounds are very lovely, and the exhibits outside are informative and educational. Indoors it's like a small museum with excellent exhibits that my son found interesting and entertaining. I would recommend the tar pits for older kids that are interested in science.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmyH191
40,Interesting prehistoric museum in the middle of Los Angeles,"La Brea Tar Pits and Museum are an interesting way to spend a couple of hours. The museum presents information about prehistoric animals and the tar pits including the fossils that have been removed from them. We probably spent about an hour walking through the exhibits looking at the many fossils and current work. There are several tar pits to see on the grounds. The largest is in front of the museum, and you can see the gas bubbling up. Other pits list what fossils were found there. The in progress work is particularly interesting as it makes it more current and real, especially to children. I would recommend this museum to families with children and for adults who have interest in science and natural history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LissaJ41
50,Fantastic prehistoric museum with great phehistoric fossils,"This was probably one of the best places I visited in LA. The exhibitions of excellent fossil includes mammoths, saber teeth cats, dire wolfs, lions..... Yes - there were lions in LA is really wonderful, equally for grown-ups and kids.The Tar Pits themselves are all active and if you are lucky you can see some tar bubbling up anywhere on the grounds. If you have time, take the tour, our guide was wonderful. Parking was no problem, the parking lot is right behind the museum. You should plan about 2 -4 hours, depending if you just want to do a quick walk-through or enjoy all the talks and movies.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ThomasHome
50,Amazing that this is in the middle of completely developed LA,"To see scientists actually working and catalog and prehistoric bones is amazing.to have a 100% completely preserved archaeological dig site is one in a million. M,I kept thinking that they were resurfacing Wilshire Blvd but don't be fooled.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sawce
50,Dinosaurs in LA- so cool.,"I was educated after this visit, and in awe. How cool is this that dinosaurs roamed LA, and the Tar-Pitts trapped them exposing their bones.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeoEgo22
40,Best of the Best,Read about the Tar Pits in 5th grade weekly reader in Mr Anderson's classroom in Auburn Ma. I kept this place in my mind and it became part of my bucket list. Fifty five years later my husband and I were driving around LA and I thought about this destination. LaBrea was as good as the story and I loved it. Wonderful place for children and adults alike. Would not have missed it for anything.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janisg328
50,Completely Different!,"How often can you walk past open, bubbling pits of tar in the middle of LA? Look at mammoth and other skeletons perfectly preserved by the goo? Observe an ongoing dig?In the middle of the museum is a wonderful timeline of the history of the land that you will miss if you don't look at the right side of the center display (different info on different sides. Look at both sides!) In fact this was so well done, I wish they printed a book around it. That's my only beef - that the book store really doesn't have anything that covers all the exhibits in the museum and its grounds. There is basically only a book on the skeletons. I would love to have a pamphlet or something about the land history, the geography of the area, the building of the museum, and its exhibits! I'd pay good money for that! But otherwise, the museum and grounds are just stunning, and unlike anything you will find anywhere else.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KBBostonBoston
50,Fun and Educational Activity,We saw the live show and 30-minute 3D movie. It was a great way to spend the afternoon during a recent visit to Los Angeles. The shows and displays provide information in a clear and concise manner. The fishbowl area was a great feature - being able to see actual work in progress was great!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/935aprilb
50,La Brea Tar Pits,"The tar pits contain prehistoric bones, etc. and of course, tar. The museum if very interesting and educational. Lots of fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MichelleElyseLesser
50,My (Joint) Favourite Place on Earth!,"Everyone who know's me will tell you that Wilshire boulevard, and the La Brea Tar Pits along with the the Museum, is a place I cannot get enough of. The museum is probably the best of it's kind on this earth, and the Tar Pits are absolutely amazing, Neolithic meets 2015 LA. This is an absolute MUST visit if you are in Los Angeles, you will learn so much, and the atmosphere around the Tar Pits is nothing less than amazing",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/310GeorgeH
50,Nice place to visit,Great museum with a lot of information and cool skeletons. I liked the way it setup by walking in a circle around and being able to read and interact. It was nice to finally learn what the Tar Pits actually were.....go see for yourslf.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y7407JJphilipl
50,One of America's Most Amazing Geological Site,The Tar Pits are an incredible geological site unique anywhere in the country. Amazing finds have been discovered in this black and gooey version of quick sand. Fully preserved Wooly Mammoths and Sabre Toothed Tigers have been extracted and who knows what else is entombed here.It is a truly educational place to visit with kids of all ages.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L5112CDrichards
50,Excellent Small Museum at La Brea Tar Pits,"We have been to the Tar Pits several times, but never went in the Page Museum until we had guests from out of town. It's an excellent small museum and explains all about the Tar Pits. The Tar Pits themselves are a free attraction and a self-guided tour explains most of the history. Fascinating to see tar bubbling up out of the ground in downtown LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rexflash
40,Arrive early,Haven't been here since I was a kid. A lot has changed. Their exhibits were awesome. Went on the little tour and there shows. The shows are only like 20-30 minutes long. I would get there early. It gets crowded in the afternoon. We got there around 10 and was able to see everything and have some lunch. It was a little confusing to find the parking lot. It is surrounded by the park so bring a lunch. There is no cafe in the museum. We went to the cafe in the museum next door. The kids learned a lot and got to see fossils that they were working on. Worth it to spend a day there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mookix
50,Went on the 3rd,It was very interesting to see all the fossils that have been discovered. I liked watching the curators putting them together. The only let down was most of the 'pits' looked more like someone just dropped a bucket of asphalt on a patch of concrete and they fenced if off. They do have project 23 where you can watch them remove artifacts from crates of asphalt and dig in one of the pits.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wheelerbob
40,Fascinating Place,"The Page Museum 'La Brae Tar pits' in Los Angeles plots and describes the history of many species of animals that perished in the Tar Pits. There is something there for all ages. Staff are very helpful, entry free modest. You can view different does where archeologists are still excuvating. The Palentology lab staff can be viewed from behind glass. Across the road are inexpensive street food trucks for lunch or snack. These food trucks display food safety rating. Well worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/656wendyt
50,A place to go with the kids and natural history buffs.,"School age and up will enjoy this look into the prehistoric history of the area that exists today because of a natural outcropping of tar that existed millions of years ago. The grounds are park like and if you don't mind the smell of tar, fun for the kids. It is next to the Los Angeles Fine Arts Museum-LACMA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wilywizard
50,A trip back in time,"Very nice facility. Air conditioned and very clean, the museum was laid out really well. We loved watching the 3D movie about the Ice Age, gave a really good primer for adults and kids! Excellent and very interesting place to visit! Our tour guide was fabulous and obviously really enjoyed her work there at the Tar Pits! Thank you!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SongDog007
40,Excellent Attraction,"Very interesting seeing what they retrieved from the tar pits! There's also an excellent robotic sabre tooth tiger you need to book to see, it's called like Ice Age adventures or something and you can book tours! Overall very interesting for the whole family!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TeenReviewing
30,A little disappointed,"Travelling around the world this was on my bucket list if things to see.What I didn't expect was a large ""pond"" which was fenced off so you can't get a decent picture, with oil/tar floating on the surface. Even the bubbles look a little fake and made up for the tourists. It just looked fake, but I appreciate it's not.Didn't go in the museum as it's small and the natural history museum in London is far better.Overall it's ticked off the bucket list but it's very tired and disappointing",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y7695AIpeters
40,It is a good learning experience,I learned a lot about paleontology and watching people do their digs on the property and how many animals were caught in the pits and have been found. It is a very interesting tour to see the varied fossils and know their history and how much was preserved. I thought it was a great place to take kids who have an interest in the Dinosaur age from a more real standpoint than an amusement park. Take the time to look at the fossils and ask questions if someone is available outside from the digs. The museum is really well set up with time lines and where animals were found.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R4960NKjustinw
50,Really Cool.,"This place is like WOW. Just to see that this existed in CA and to actually see the asphalt bubble up is so cool and to see all the fossils they have collected is amazing and to see a actually size mammoth, puts things into perspective. Really fun and the park outside is really nice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leeannb413
40,"Unique place, one of a kind.",You can go thru the Museum in 30 minutes (not including the film which is extra) and if you do so in the last 30 minutes before closing tickets are 1/2 price ($6). The outside part of the park is free so just see that if you are on a budget. The location is educational and different. Most families can see the whole thing in 60-90 minutes. It is a low key outing great at the end of the day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AtlantaBusTravel
40,Iconic location good for quick trip,"Having lived in SoCal for almost my entire life and specifically in LA for the last five years, I cannot believe it took me so long to finally get here. Using a Groupon, the admission was even cheaper, but without the price is not bad. Walking around the park is free, where you can view the iconic mammoths in the pit as well as see many other natural tar pits throughout the park. The smell can be strong, but it is pretty amazing to see. The museum is small, but enjoyable and great for a short trip or for kids with short attention span.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J5918PUelizabethc
50,"Surprising Place,Informative, A Bit of Time Travel - into Our Past!","Brilliant place, bubbling tar pits which they are still excavating...and the complete skeletons I was amazed and right in the middle of the city. You can park around the streets for free. Worth the fee in my opinion, where else could you see this? My partner said that he was able to see them down in the pits digging the last time he went...30 years ago! I guess it's not safe any more but the whole museum is very interesting and I would re visit if I go back to LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaryH22
50,"This is must to see, honestly.","It so funny to see that it is just in the centre of town, impresive to see huge and ancient animals skeletons in perfect condition. It like a time capsul. Tar is still coming out from ground, museum offers discounted tickets in last 30 mins before closing (1700 hrs is closing time). Excavation is still in progress, you can see restoration prpcess too. Great experince, especially few hundreds pieces of wolf skulls on the walls is not scene you may see in everywhere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aydinkerim
40,Small but informative; Entire Place Needs Updating,The museum has good pieces but is disappointing in the presentation. The explanations are a bit outdated and more recent discoveries need to be at the forefront of the presentation. The museum looks tired. It is certainly a grand dame that needs some refurbishing. The 3D presentation was abysmal. The noise level was pretty high. The outdoor exhibits were good and the atrium needs more labels by the plants.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/delen1
40,GR8 History Lesson in Downtown LA,"We visited the Tar Pits on a Sunday morning when there was little traffic, and found free parking along 6th street just behind the exhibit. The museum lot charges $10 just to park, but it's worth it if you can't walk very far or the street is full. Street is a 4 hr max with a credit card charge other days. Read signs or get a mega $$$$ ticket !!!It was a short walk thru the Tar Pit parking lot to view and smell the tar pits and various excavations for free and to read and learn how this oil pit and the fossils it contains are a vital part of LA history. Get the free interactive map on their web site (the link is not allowed in this text).Gr8 fun to visit with kids in 30 minutes or less, or pay modest fee to access museum, 3D movie & lectures..We were very impressed with the location of the well-preserved site among the towering, multi million $$$ skyscrapers and also the amount of information provided outdoors for free. So, after seeing the quality of the ongoing work that they do, we also visited the museum for a modest $9 Senior entry fee and an extra $4 to see the 3D movie. Admission also included the ability to schedule attending a lecture by paleontologists about specifics on the current dig items which was fascinating.It was awesome to see the actual size of the ""small"" and ""medium"" animals, read about them, see the lab where volunteers remove the asphalt that has preserved over 300 million (yes, that's correct) fossils making it the largest in the world, plus the outstanding 3D movie showing the history of earth & oil. We thought it would take under an hour and spent over two hours that went very quickly. Highly recommend it to all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bchgrl9
50,Well put together museum,"This museum isn't all that big, but the exhibits were well put together and very interesting. It's a little on the pricey side ($16) but you can always look at all the exhibits outside the museum for free. It took us about 90 minutes to do the inside of the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/10DawnG
40,Great way to spend an hour.,"Our family wasn't planning to visit the Tar Pits, but we happened to run across them after another activity in the city. The museum was small but informative. It was nice to walk around the grounds and see the pits. So glad we went!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/5Travellers1263
50,Interesting!!!,fossils are always and interesting piece to look at and there are a lot at Page Musuem. When you are lucky there are not a lot of people going there and you can take your time taking pictures and going around the various rooms!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mandarin_mom
50,"Unexpected, yet Interesting","It's amazing when you realize that the La Brea Tar Pits are right on Wilshire Blvd. There is a great deal to see and to learn about the people and animals who lived in the area way before Los Angeles was a city. A wonderful learning experience for everyone, and it's next door to LACMA, so you can visit two museums in one afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/garnetngolden76
40,Amazing,"First of all, this is an amazing attraction right in the middle of LA, complete with bubbling tar pit. It's great that the museum is on site. The museum is small, but interesting. I should have skipped the movie, not worth the extra cost or time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DaisyB7
50,Fantastic Venue,Besides the awesome exhibits they have live outdoor music much of the year. Its a great place for a picnic or you can purchase food- great for families .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sworrels
50,Lots to see!,"I visited on a weekday during the school year and there were groups of kids everywhere, so I actually didn't even enter the museum, just walked around the grounds. Still, there was lots to see, and it's such a unique site... I definitely recommend a visit if you are in the Los Angeles area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lynds_x
50,learning is the best part of travel,"Few places in LA are as likely to impact your memory than the LA Brea. First envision a museum, not a pit. Then think of a presentation of what all of LA was before civilization... Before the skyscrapers, before the concrete, before the smog. Like the Grand Canyon it will alter your Definition of time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mikek794
50,Cute little museum that can capture your attention,"My 10-year-old son and I had a 10 hour layover in LAX and we decided to leave the airport. We chose La Brea Tar Pits. We ended up taking two buses to get there - nothing too difficult - and we were dropped off right at the gates to the museum. There are two areas here.First we explored the outside area. I was surprised that there are actually tar pits remaining from the Pleistocene era. There were also several statues of animals from that era that my son enjoyed climbing. A recent development, the museum next door wanted to put in underground parking when they began excavation found bones in the soil. Big chunks of soil were removed by a machine that typically moves trees. These chunks were placed in wooden boxes and scientists are digging through the chunks to find animal remains. There are signs informing on-lookers about bones that are found daily.Once inside, I was amazed at all there was to see. A person could easily spend an entire day there, but on average a few hours probably suffice for most people. I really enjoyed the tourist pictures that were taken at the museum. Usually, these pictures are of family members standing in front of a green screen and that is it. This company captured us in poses trying to get away from a saber-toothed cat (they are no longer referred to as saber-toothed tigers) and struggling to free ourselves from the tar pits.There are bones all over the place and an interesting glassed in section where observers can see archeologists and volunteers cleaning bones and other debris.We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves at this museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LLPT
40,Interesting,"I went here as a kid but it's better now then I remembered. My husband really wanted to see this so we went and it's neat. It only costs like $12 for the museum, which I thought was worth it. There's a tour you can take that's included with admission price, but we didn't because we were a little short on time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/221jennw
40,Fascinating,Very well made display of mammoths sinking into an actual tar pit on site. The smell of the tar remains in your nostrils for a while.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hermes_NL
40,Worth a visit,I had remembered hearing about the tar pits back in elementary school and we had time before we headed to the beach so we checked it out. The museum has many interested displays. The tar pits were neat to see. It is worth spending a couple hours here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CherylH396
50,Jurassic Park!,Blow your mind by checking out the La Brea Tar Pits. This piece of ancient history is so fascinating! It's like a real Jurassic Park... the only bad thing is that several visitors had decided to throw trash in the tar pits and that is just so wrong and upsetting to see. They could do a better job maintaining this amazing place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KortneeWithak
50,"Perfect Family Visit Spot: History, Not too Long, Decent Parking","This is a great gem in LA, because you can get in and out easily, its is a substantial amount of hisptory and education for the kids but short enough that you don't lose their attention. Excellent exhibits, and the surrounding park has several tar pits available to see what they look like with & without excavation going on. They replaced the old cartoon movie and charge for the new 3-D experience (I didn't see it).Also, there is a great park area to rest under tree shade, enjoy a picnic and lay down for the afternoon. Plus, you are about 500' away from LA County Museum of Art, so you can enjoy that visit too or at least see some of their outdoor exhibitions like Levitated Mass and the 1000 lightpoles (I don't know the name of that one). And you are only a short 5 minute drive from The Grove for shopping and restaurants.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chazzb_12
50,Awesome if you love this kind of thing.,The Tar Pits are pretty cool. Its a small place not that big but there are some cool animals fossils and sites you can visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DiegoPachecoIT
50,Must see!,"It was Bugs Bunny who alerted us to the La Brea Tar Pits all those years ago but it really is a must-see. Remarkable work is being done by the paleontologists and volunteers to unearth skeletons from thousands of years ago-- great displays, too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AndrewB615
40,Awesome Way to Spend A Few Hours in L.A.,"I love the La Brea Tar Pits! What a cool thing to see in Los Angeles. There's a big museum, but it costs money to go in, so we skipped it. Still, there's plenty to see here. It's next door to the L.A. museum of contemporary art, and you can walk the grounds of the museum and see a big tar lake with statues of Mammoth Elephants that used to live in L.A. (during the Ice Age). You can smell the tar, and there's lots of informational signs around to get an idea of the history. Cool activity for kids! Fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ClintPage
40,Fascinating experience at La Brea Tar Pits,"We had an informative trip with our guide through the La Brea Tar Pits in June 2015. Quite a different experience than we had ever had. The strong scent of what is really oil bubbling up from underground is something to be aware of, but the attraction is well worth it! We were told that only 4 paid staff work at the pits and anyone could volunteer to excavate. It is really a journey that takes you back in time, and we thoroughly enjoyed it. Do not wear your good shoes because you can step in little pits without even realizing it because they pop up around the grounds are not always marked. Great for the famlly of all ages and plan on a few hours inside the museum and with the outside tour which is included in your admission.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/domp103
40,Fascinating,"I didn't go inside the museum, but the stuff accessible in the grounds was well documented and fairly extensive. The staff explaining the excavations are patient, well-mannered and clearly passionate about their expertise. I was particularly impressed with their manner with kids. You can even see the scientists at work in a current dig. The big tar pit out the front bubbles away constantly, evoking a nice prehistoric feel! A good set-up, highly recommended for a stroll around before heading into LACMA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnofFitzroy
40,Pretty interesting,"We spent a couple of hours wandering around the tar pits, we didn't pay to go into the museum as we were not intending on staying too long. It was very interesting to see the skeletal remains of prehistoric animals that sunk into the tar. It is amazing to see that they are still actively uncovered more and more. It is amazing that the pool is still bubbling.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/keenastraveller
40,The tar pits are still bubbling.,"The museum is close to a mile of different museums. Pay parking underground. If you are pressed for time, you can actually see one tar pit that is outside the museum. Museum itself has several different types of skeletons of different animals that became trapped in the tar. Movies and exhibits to watch that are quite interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/diane1024
50,Journey Back in Time,"We stopped with the intent to spend a couple hours. We had no idea what a great place this was and just how much there was to see and learn about. I have to be honest when I say I thought it would be a touristy waste, but boy was I wrong! The history here is absolutely incredible and to see the sheer number of fossils uncovered is absolutely amazing! Well worth a day and the cost of admission!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/roberthI1509IV
30,Interesting place,Really enjoyed this place. To see the Tar Pits itself was really cool. Did not know they were free to see. The museum itself is what you pay for. It has many of the skeletons of the animals they have unearthed on display. It is an active site so you see the scientists working on things they have found. Very interesting and informative way to spend an hour or two. If you just want to see the Tar Pits then park and look around...if you want skeletal remains then pay the admission price.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/135allenm
50,A must see with the kids,"This museum is in the heart of Los Angeles. Tar pits where for centuries animals came to a body of water to drink, unaware that beneath the surface of the water the footing was tar. Animals of all species sank and drowned in tar. This museum has unearthed the perfect skeletons from history. Mammoths, siber-tooth tigers etc.A walk through the museum will fascinate. All this in downtown LA. To date the tar still bubbles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Doodlehockey
30,More geared towards younger people,"The museum, like most everything in LA, was tough to get to on public transit. The exhibits were interesting but I'm pretty sure they haven't updated anything since before I was born. And I'm 36. So, you can take the dated-ness as lack of care, or you can take it for nostalgia. If you're nearby anyhow, it is certainly worthwhile to visit, but don't take a good portion of your trip making a point of going here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Becky55110
40,Entertaining Museum,Entertaining for couple hours. It's got some displays inside some showing prehistoric animals and some showing about tar pit. You can see the Tar Pits for free (it's outside) and have to pay to see displays inside. Worth a visit. I purchased an discounted annual pass through one of the coupon sites but ended up going only once. Parking is free on Sundays on meter parking on streets.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BigBoyA77
40,Worth the stop,Took our 14 y.o. and 10 y.o. Both had learned about the Tar Pits in school so this was great for them to see in person. We walked around the displays on the outside (free) and then went into the museum (cost). We were there for just under 2 hours. We were able to find a parking spot on the street for $1 / hour (metered but accepts both quarters and credit card),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tbga53107
40,Very fascinating - a must for museum buffs!,Exhibits OK - probably need up-dating a bit. Enjoyed watching the archeologists attending to their bones! A small exhibit but very fascinating.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dinah539
40,Interesting,"Interesting place to visit for both adults & children, the ongoing work is fascinating, easy to combine a visit to Hollywood afterwards",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/22karene
50,Fascinating!,Went there with my grandchildren aged 5 and 8 - they loved it and so did I! Very informative - staff were friendly and interacted well with the kids! A great afternoon!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/147aussiegirl
50,Sticky history,"Amazing that such a place can be right in the middle of an urban environment. Tells the story of the site well, especially with the tar lake right there on the grounds bubbling up methane and covered with black tar. The mammoth statues on the edge of the lake in one picture show the concept. Highpoint of LA trip",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/evilledrwho
40,Good excursion for a few hours.,"The museum and surrounding grounds/garden make for a good time in downtown LA. They do a good job of explaining the history of the site and the source of the so-called ""tar."" They also describe how/why the site is a great one for fossil-hunting. If you're looking for something unique to do, this park/museum is a good LA experience ...that will take about 3 hours to see/do everything there is to see/do there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Michael_WorldWanders
50,Great place to spend an hour or two,"Told my 2 and 5 year old that we were going to go see a ""little piece of history"". After waking the grounds for almost an hour with my family, my oldest said it was a ""big piece of history"". I asked what part he enjoyed the most he said the live dig site. Warning make sure you look out for soft spots on the grass and avoid the green cones.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/422michaeljm
40,Fun place,This is a fun yet interesting and educational place to visit. The museum is great and has many excellent exhibits. The tar pits are fascinating as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/448cheriep
40,Very Educational,"I was surprised at how many, & what a great variety of Fossils were on display. A number of the displays are animated so children would find them interesting, even have the opportunity to pull a rod up through a container of tar to show how easy is was for the animals to get stuck. Many Information labels are available to read if you want to spend the time. Also an operating laboratory where behind glass the researchers work.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SPYC
40,very interesting for adults and children,Large park type setting with a huge museum and restoration of artifacts. There are guides mingling in the crowd giving talks about what you are seeing.The displays are instructional and are set in a large open setting. The school kids seemed to be overwhelmed with too much information. maybe this site is geared to children with a focus ondinosaurs.there is an upscale café with gourmet lunch type food. the dining selection is not for the younger crowd.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrsbudboden
50,Great Educational Experience,One of our favorite places to take visitors. Thousands of years of history live before your eyes. Museum is excellent and is a great visit. The outdoor tar pits are amazing!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/695judj
50,Special attraction in downtown Los Angeles,Fascinating attraction for adults and older kids. Great museum and accompanying movie. Walk around and see the tar pits first hand with a knowledgeable guide. I spent about 2 hours there to see it all.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Susanellen26
50,Glimpse Into The Past,"Saw the new 3D movie "" Ice Age Mammals."" Although only 20-25 minutes, it's worth seeing for the terrific scenery and computer generated mammals. Also, seeing the Tar Pits after the film is a natural follow up and dovetails into what happened for some of the animals. Definitely worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/217anitaw
50,What a fun couple of hours,"This is not a dinosaur museum! What they did have was very nicely presented, a lot of volunteers and a great place for kids! We loved the displays who would think there would be so many fossils in such a small area!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rrwidow
40,small but cool!,i liked that it was small and made its point........we enjoyed walking around the grounds. also its so different with tar oozing right in the middle of the city........plus enjoyed the latin music they had on the grounds that day........we had a nice break at the cafe on the grounds. fun afternoon on smoggy LA day!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/77mockmotorspitcher
50,Step Aside Fred Flinstone,"Don't miss the free with admission the Excavator Tour! Our guide was extremely knowledgeable, interesting, enlightening with all the group! Full of fun facts! I learned so much!!!Page Museum is informative, enjoyable and you can watch volunteers work meticulously cleaning specimens in the Fossil Lab.Located in Hancock Park, you can wander the tar pits for free, enjoy sitting in the shade and enjoying a street performer.Page Museum/La Brea Tarpits are part of Museum Row on Miracle Mile, you are walking distance to LA County Museum of Art, Craft and Folkart Museum and Petersen Automotive Museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mwlucas4
30,It's only Okay.,"was interesting, but found that it had very little to offer to keep you there. Maybe it was just a bad day, but I don't need someone to sell me another picture of the family in front of a green screen.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/timr914
50,Very educational,"While, I did not know that part of LA history, so it was a very educational experience. There were a lot too see, both indoor and out door. We truely enjoyed our weekend visit. The surrounding area are also very lovely. Outdoor concert in the night, art museum, shopping... I also would love to explore the possibilty of volunteer there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PSF88
40,Flintstones right in the middle of LA,"One would think that Tar Pits would be out in the country some where. This is right in the middle of town (next to the LACMA). The entire area is nice to walk around. Watching the lake bubble up is interesting! We didn't go into the museum but you can walk around on the roof and look down into an ""oasis"" with a coy pond. There is plenty to see just walking around the public area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/candacet119
40,Very Interesting in the middle of the city,"I stopped by here while being over at the Grove and in the city. The tar pits are so interesting in the middle of the city. You will find the attraction very informative and amazed at what they have found in the tar. The attraction is very small and you will get through it very quickly. I would save this for the end of a trip and combine it with other things. You have to check it out, but it will not be the main event during your day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MistyK_12
50,Sticky Situation,"Excellent museum, grounds are essentially unchaged for millenia, escept for the buildings. Still has pits bubbling, still oozing. Paleontogists still working in the pits and in the rooms. Thousands of fossils, kids will love it. Dire wolves, saber tooth cats, mastadons, mammoths, etc. No dinosaurs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eross16
30,Informative and Interesting,"Learned a lot from the attraction. They even had a short presentation on the fossil lab. However, there should be more activities or attraction. You can finish everything for thirty minutes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/macu70
30,Cool but Really Small.,"I've been going here for decades & it's interesting but small & overpriced. It's right next door to the LACMA, so most people visit both in one day. If you have little kids & you're going to LACMA or the Peterson anyway, you might as well visit it once. Parking sucks & the traffic is terrible, so don't make a special trip down here just for the Tar Pits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/332marleneh
50,Amazing,Over 1 million fossils and helpful curators to explain what the tar pits are and how they are excavated. A fascinating indoor and outdoor museum with skeletons of ice age creatures from mammoths to wolves that will interest children and adults.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarahsinfo
50,Love it!,I visited this museum with Vegas 2 Hollywood tour which picked us up from our Las Vegas hotel and brought us to several museums for the day. This was one of them and we truly found it to be a fantastic experience. I really enjoy learning about the history of ice age and was truly pleased with the exhibit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/416mollyf
20,My Only Regret in LA,To put it bluntly: I wasted $12 and the better part of my morning here. I thought the idea of tar pits would be so cool but it really wasn't. Look at the lake of tar outside the museum then move on. The museum has very little to see and then you'll have to wait for the guided tour that takes you around the grounds but is also not worth it. My only regret on my trip.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mikekowalczyk
40,Husband loved this,During a quick tour of LA with two teenagers we tried to find something for everyone. After a stroll down Rodeo drive for the teen girls it was off to La Brea. It's free to wander the park and look at the bubbling tar which is very unique in an Urban setting and there is also an observation area in the back that you can watch actual excavation (also free). The museum is new and very interesting. If you get there close to closing time like we did (was closing in 45 min. ) you only had to pay 1/2 price and you can cover the whole place in 1/2 hour.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Denapriser
40,always a good spot to take in lunch ~,"nice array of foods and drink - great location - simple, self serve and good food. people friendly and eatery clean and well maintained. seating in and outdoors = nice options.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/20neveradullmoment13
50,Do the 3d theatre and excavation tour,Make sure you do the 3d theatre and see titans of the ice age... You really learn a lot about the tar pits from seeing this. We also enjoyed a talk from the palaeontology labatory and went in the excavation tour. Great value!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/905vanessam
50,So very interesting,"We spent a most informative and thought provoking morning at this museum. Even though it was school holidays, and busy, we really got a lot of knowledge from the guided tour of the outdoor tar pits.We also learnt heaps from within the Museum itself.Thoroughly recommended for families and everyone else who has an inquiring mind.Would return there when we are back in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/763lynettew
30,Would visit once but probably not again,"Everyone should see the tar pits once but we felt this wasn't a good value for the money paid. The museum was an extra fee and we had thought it was included, so disappointing. We were there less than an hour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CovAmy
50,Not hard to find and quite a lot of fun!,You have to pay to park separately which is a little of a downfall but lots of discounts available. I took my fiancé and brother here and my brother is active military and he got a free ticket for himself and one other adult. It was great all he had to do was show military id. They take a photo in front of a green screen which you can buy at the end for $25 I think. There were many animals reconstructed and some interactive things that were pretty neat. Nice outdoor park that's free to sit and enjoy. Overall nice place I enjoyed it very much.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kvacay
50,AMAZING,"I want to go back, the bubbling hot tar, really intrigued me. I want to learn more about that animals that fell into the hot boiling tar pits. Hardly, anyone has ever heard of the tar pits. What, Where, When are the questions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Maddie843
40,A must see,"Its not closed off to the public,so you can walk up for free and check the pits out. There's the museum that you can go to for more of an experience. But I just wanted to see the Tar Pits. It smells pretty bad around there, but that's expected. The pits bubble every couple minutes. I think they're on a timer because they were pretty consistent. It's still interesting. It also took forever to get there. And there's a couple restaurants right across from it within walkinf distance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jjnlina
50,"A FUN Museum for 3 age groups, how cool is that","so GLAD we choose the Page museum over guided tour of Los Angeles County Museum of Art when we had the kids with us... they loved it... high point of their visit, still talking about it... we did the LACMofA the next day by ourselves, much better for us",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DnAC
50,Amazing,It is incredible that this is in the middle of the city.. What an amazing place. You can actually watch them dig for bones while you watch. Plenty of displays. Great place for school kids and adults alike.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelcO2461JB
50,Titans of the Ice Age,"Hooray, they finally updated the old introduction movie! I went to see this with my 7 year old and we both enjoyed it. My son who loved the old animated movie about the tar pits and would watch it repeatedly! The new film expands on the old movie, and also presents a lot of new information.It's only just opened, so I recommend reserving your tickets online. Free for members, and I think there's a fee for non-members.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/o_nate_o
50,Makes a visit to LA city worth it!,"If you interested in Natural History, the La Brea Tar Pits is a must see! Preserved saber tooth and Mammoth bones in the middle of LA. That's just cool.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/drlcs1
30,Interesting,"We have been to Los Angeles many times over the years, but never thought to stop and see the La Brea Tar Pits and museum. We happened to be on vacation with my sister on her first visit to the area. She wanted to see what this was all about. Glad we made the detour to visit this museum. It was a unique sight, especially in the midst of the ""hollywood"" tourist traps and crammed shopping. Very educational, especially for the younger crowd. Learned a little of pre-historic history, which was not a strong interest of mine before this trip. It made me want to learn more, which is exactly what a good museum should try and accomplish.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rickduplantier
40,Change,"Tar pit is a one time place to go with teenager. .With small children this is a ideal place to go. They will love all the animals there, they will get a kick out of it. You will love it as well this will teach young mind to have that imagination to bloom.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Neicey217
40,For the bone lover,"Small, lots of bones. They have a viewing area where you can watch the staff cleaning the bones. You can view a working dig in a gooey tar pit. Those are some dedicated people. Stinky and sticky. Cool atrium in the middle. Great toys in the gift shop. Parking will cost you. Ok little cafeteria over at Lacma, better eats further into Lacma.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/idrawart
50,Nice park to spend a few hours,"Spend some time wandering through the museum, looking at everything that has been found.I really liked watching the people work on cleaning up the bones.Afterwards the grounds are a great place for a picnic, just as long as you don't sit down wind of the lake.You can walk around the park for free and check out the lake with the methane gas bubbling to the surface, the tar pits are scattered around and you can see one that is being worked on.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FlightlessBird75
40,Unique expereience,We spent about an hour walking outside around the tar pits. We didn’t have enough time to see the Page Museum. Parking onsite is a $10 flat rate. We stopped to talk to a volunteer standing under a tent outside who pointed out the different areas to view. This was helpful as we didn’t know our way around & would have missed things. Pit 91 was very interesting & educational for our kids. There were a few orange cones located throughout the park (in grassy) spots where new tar bubbles were coming up. This is a unique experience as we were told it’s the largest tar pit located in an urban setting in the world.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bethanynd
50,This Museum is Extremely Interesting for the entire family,"We were visiting California and went to the Venice Beach and found a lot of tar along the shoreline. This museum helped my daughter understand tar, the impact it has on wildlife and got to interact with a scientist who shared her work with us. It was fascinating and educational for our family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EGRap
40,Interesting Afternoon.,"Extra fun was the tiny softball sized burbling ""tar pit"" outside the property near the gate, granddaughter loved poking this with a stick. Interesting museum with staff working on current projects behind windows. Skeletons galore. Fun for children.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wallflowerart
40,Something new to do in LA!,"We were in LA for 4 days and having been there before we thought it would be nice to try something different and maybe a little less touristy than other things we had done in LA before. I didn’t know what to expect from the Tarpits and I was pleasantly surprised. The museum is reasonably priced and very interesting. It’s very interactive and is interesting for people of all ages. We spent about an hour and a half walking around the museum and then did the guided tour of the tarpit excavations. It was interesting, but we didn’t realise you could self-walk the tour, which would have been better for us as we were scheduled into a tour late in the afternoon and had to wait around for our time slot. I don’t think we would have missed out on much if we had gone without a guide.The one thing that would be great to see is a café of some sort at the museum where you can get a drink and a snack. They do not have any facilities of this sort. There are vending machines outside the museum that sell soft drinks, and tables where you can sit to drink them but nothing much else.We were staying at Hollywood Roosevelt on Hollywood Boulevard and caught a taxi which was about $15 each way, and very easy – make sure you have the address as our taxi driver on the way there didn’t know what the LeBrea Tarpits were. This was actually one of the better days we had in LA! We walked to the Farmers Market/Grove after the tour, which took about 10mins. Recommend this unique LA experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spazwok
50,Fossils!,"I've always wanted to see the Tar Pits. They were very interesting. As we spoke with a local she pointed out that little tar pits still pop up occasionally around the park. Kids love to hunt the park for the pits and poke sticks at the tar. Which turns out isn't really tar, but asphalt. Who new that asphalt was a naturally occurring substance from crude oil?! The Page museum is small, but very educational and very well done. We skipped the excavation tour due to our limited time. The tar pits are still an active excavation site and they're pulling out new fossils everyday. The park surrounding the museum is free. The parking lot for the tar pits is $10 flat rate. The museum reciprocates with other natural history museums and since we have a membership to our own ASTC museum our entrance fee was free.Absolutely loved it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FamilyVacationJuly11
40,Worth the effort,It's not a museum that you need to spend a half day at. You can see it all in just a couple of hours. They do a tour of the tar pits every couple of hours and it's worth it if you can get a ticket (included in the price). They are about to get a theater where they can show a 3-D movie which will be good. This amazing place is worth your time and effort. Perfect to visit this place and LA County Museum of Art on the same day. Some street parking is available and cc are accepted at the meter. I enjoyed myself at Page.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dalpokes
40,Great learning experience!,"If you want to learn a bit more about the city we live in then this is the place to go. The Tar Pits or asphalt pits ( given that it is asphalt and not tar) is a great place for the whole family. We spent about 3 hours walking around, did the walking tour of the museum and outdoor pits with a guide (this is a most and it is included in the admission ticket, you just need to make a reservation for the time you want to do the tour). Our guide, Felipe was fun and very knowledgable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LisleyD
50,Great Attraction,To go here and be transported back in time was amazing...the smell and the sights are very powerful....There is a lot to see and wonder what it would have been like to be alive back then...well at least that's how I felt...It's worth the trip...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/608stephenv

50,Seeing and smelling is believing,Great little park - walk-able for little ones - cool to see and smell the tar pits. Educational and fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cat6102
50,Nice place to visit even on a fast trip :),"Love the current excavations, walking inside and outside to see the tar Pits it was a really nice visit. You can actually see the fossil Lab it was really interesting",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JVDreamBig
40,Sabretooth Tigers Oh My,"Ok, so Ill admit it, I wasn't that interested in going to the La Brea Tar Pits, and it was just something that my mum had said she'd always wanted to see but hadn't yet. So I took the opportunity to go one afternoon and I really enjoyed it. It was a stunning Tuesday afternoon and pretty quiet. I bought a fruit cup from a street vendor and just took my time walking around the park. When I got to the museum about 4pm, they said they were closing at 5pm, but I could get in for half price, even better! I walked around the museum and really enjoyed seeing the different skeletons, particularly of the Mammoth and the Sabretooth Tiger which I'd never seen before. Turned out to be a pretty cool place to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SonicANTZ
50,Great facility,"Well setup, great displays, hands on, amazing exhibitsWell setup, great displays, hands on, amazing exhibits",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/607emanuels
30,Maybe I'm missing something,"The last time I was here was 30 years ago and it seemed so much more awesome back then. My son and I took about a half hour to do a full lap around the museum. We signed up for the free tour but when the tour guide said the tour would take three hours, my son and I looked at each other and I asked him if he was hungry. He said yes, so we purchased a few souvenirs & left and went in search of lunch!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/629kristineb
40,Interesting but you only need a half day here.,Spent the morning at the La brea tar pits and Page Museum. Smell of asphalt fills the air. Very interesting to see the large number of fossils recovered. Glad I visited but once is enough.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NJBeast2000
50,La Brea Tar Pits,A must see! We really enjoyed seeing the fossils and the active pit where they are still digging up fossils!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NancyRJ
30,LA Road Trip,Not very impressive. Small with a lot of skeletons of animals that were stuck in the tar pits. We went during the week so the traffic was very light inside.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeanF663
50,Don't miss the famous Ice Age Fossils,"Located in the heart of metropolitan Los Angeles, the Page Museum at the La Brea Tar Pits is easily accessible by taking advantage of the Starline City Sightseeing ticket, you get off at stop 10 on the red line. Walking towards the musuem on Wilshire Blvd you can smell the tar & as you get closer you can see it bubbling away in the large tar pit at the enterance of the park. There are life size displays of prehistoric animals from the area in this pit. Inside there are world famous ice age fossils, and a wonderful viewing area where you can watch paleontologists at work. This museum is a great place to spend a few hours & see a different side to what LA has to offer other than the usual glitz & glamour this location is known for. A must see unusual attraction to add some diversity to your holiday.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Leannamarie63
40,History and science in one location,"When you get past the school groups, the Page Museum is a fantastic place to visit. I loved being able to see archaeologists working on the specimens.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/InfrequentFlyer22
40,Best attraction in LA,"The pits are bubbling due to natural gas and of the 100 or more just one is being excavated now. There are no dinosaurs but ancient animals such as mammoth, giant sloth and some kind of tiger/cat. The animals got stuck in the tar and died there so the remains are complete. The reconstructions are great and you can sometimes watch the scientists at work through the glass windows. Good introduction to geology and zoology.Great place for the kids - suggest you use public transport to save parking hassles - our group walked from the bus. In comparison to the rest of LA I found this not just interesting and informative but of genuine interest i.e. not at all touristy. As I went with a tour not sure what it cost but I would have paid quite a lot to see it if on my own.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pippa65
50,Great little museum,We had a great time. It was smaller than we expected but it was a great museum. We especially liked seeing the tar bubbles and the smell of the tar was the 1st thing we noticed as soon as we got into the park. Super cool,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HAM04
50,OH MY GOD GREAT!!,This place is fantastic. It is hugh. It is a DON'T MISS attraction. You can smell the tar and see it bubbling. There are movies to see while you look at the exhibits. This place is great for all ages.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rosalief779

50,Great,"This was one of the best attractions I found in LA. Even the outside was interesting. Great park walk, with statues and items of art were very interesting. The Tar Pits, were messy with rubbish, but you could still see the tar slowly bubbling up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lois233
50,Ice Age,"This was awesome! It's not a very big place but very interesting. To see all those reconstructed skeletons was impressive considering they began with a pile of mixed bones. All I could think was - Manny, Diego and Sid :) the makers of Ice age must have been inspired by this place.I say thank you to the scientists who took the time to patiently go through the discoveries and put them together for people to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DancingKooDoo
50,"Unusual, informative exhibit for all ages, tourists and locals alike","We've taken out of town guests and grandchildren to visit the tar pits, and everyone is amazed to see (and smell) the tar that is still bubbling out of the ground to this day. They showcase the fossils of many animals who approached the area to find water and got stuck in the tar. Be sure to see the short film! It's fascinating! The park is beautiful, and you can see where the paleontologists are currently digging.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stanfordkuninrubin

40,Awesome!,"They have over 400 Dire Wolf skulls mounted on the wall, and interactive exhibits with tar! It was really interesting, but lacking in content. The information given was quite superficial, but if you go online and look around there is a lot of other information available that explains that La Brea isn't the only tar pit area in LA, and that there is a great depth of history behind the pits and the region that the museum doesn't even touch on.It is like a museum for elementary school kids. Anyone else with a strong interest in Paleoarcheology and the natural history of the area will walk away wanting. Do your research before you go and you will get a lot more out of it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Elwood_Seattle
50,Very Interesting,Our family loved this small museum. It was so interesting for all of us. The staff were very friendly and knowledgable and answered any question we had.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Etc147
40,History on a walk,"If you have any interest in paleontology, this is the trip for you. Inside and out you get to observe science from exhibits to the actual digs taking place on the site. Amazing for adults and kids!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sdnasca
50,Educational,"Restored bones of Pleistocene animals displayed in their natural habitat. Watch the asphalt bubbling up from the La Brea ""Tar Pits"" and see actual archeology in progress.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dugyb
50,Fun Day for the kids,"The museum is small and hasn't changed much over the years. But, it's still a fun place to visit. My boys ages 7 and 10 really enjoyed walking through the museum and seeing all of the fossils. The guides inside are very helpful and answer any questions. We took the free tour around the park and thought it was interesting but the signage is good so you can definitely tour it on your own. The guide was very nice and answered all of my kids questions. The parking lot is easy to access and $10 to park. There was a security guard walking around so I felt our things were safe. They are adding a new 3d video that will be opening in June and making some repairs to the building but it didn't affect our visit. I was told the displays were going to stay the same.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/348juliea
50,Watch where you walk,"Great museum and exhibits. Volunteers can take you around and explain the area , You can see the bones of many pre-ice age animals and bones left in the tar (actually , asphalt) pits. Even watch paleontologist at work. The museum is on top of and old oil field.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CynthiaF57
30,Good for kids,"Something you have heard about all your life and being from the east coast, had to go see. Might be great for kids, but as they say, ""Been There Done That""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MRM1952
50,Great Touch of History,We found this place fascinating. The black sticky asphalt-tar pits that are outside the museum can be seen without buying a ticket. The senior $9 ticket gets you inside the museum. The artifacts and fossils are professionally presented there with a lot of information posted on the walls for reading and learning the history of the owner and the tar pits. Be sure to visit the currently active pits that are on the edge of the grounds.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BruinSeniorTraveler
50,Bring the kids!,Very kid friendly and afterwards just a short walk down the street is LACMA. Visit two spots and only park once. Makes for a nice day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/N4624VIjohns
50,Mammoths and Sabertooth Cats,This is a fascinating place for adults and school kids. The tar pits trapped thousands of animals many of which are on display. This is a piece of history,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CWS55
40,A vastly overlooked attraction,"Dinosaurs in the middle of Los Angeles !! Yep thousands of them, They are still digging them up. There is still active tar there you could get stuck in. An amazing place",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chuck879
50,Animals that once roamed LA,"Skeletons of the most amazing animals that were caught in the tar pits here ons ago are reassembled for our viewing. Really interesting. I think I had been to every other LA museum in the last 10 years before going here and was totally amazed. A unique place, not to be missed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Batyah65
30,It's the Pits... ;),"I saw the tar pits the first time I visited LA in 2007. My buddy stopped the car by the biggest pit, put the hazard lights on, we stepped out, and he said ""There, that's it, there's not much else to see"". Upon my return to LA I was convinced there was much more to see...I was wrong. A tar pit is a tar pit. Saw a few more of the other smaller ones which were covered with leaves. 15$ for the museum? No. Keep in mind im 28 and perhaps I was more interested in getting my last day of shopping in, than reading about bones. If you're into archeology and natural history definitely check it out. If not, I assure you there are more entertaining things to do in LA. @livingraplyrics on instagram for photos of some more entertaining things to do in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DinedThereSippedThat
40,A pre-historic adventure,"All in all a great experience. The entry fee is not very expensive. For the price, I found there were plenty of well-presented and informative displays. I'm pretty sure any kid would love the dioramas - very well done. There's lots of space to move around and we didn't feel rushed. I was particularly interested in the actual tar pits as I've never seen this before. There are several bubbling tar pits throughout the park grounds, all of them are roped off. Fascinating to watch the thick black bubbles of gooey tar swell and burp. I'm guessing many people leave with a dab or two of sticky, gooey tar on their clothing. I certainly did! While I was taking photos I somehow ended up with a great big blob on my white cotton pants.TIP: We were on holidays, but when we got home a week later, I used gasoline to soften the tar. First, I used a cloth soaked in gasoline and applied this to the stain. Once the tar softened up a bit I was able to dab away and remove all of the tar. Finally, I cleaned the pants with soap and water (twice to get rid of the smell of gas). Presto!The Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) is right next door. If you're in town visiting it's very convenient to do both at the same time. Put aside the rest of your day (3-4 hours) as together, that's a full day of activities.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nancy_Ottawa
50,Great for kids,"Their is lots to see and do both inside and outside the museum. Outside there are several exhibits including an active dig site. Inside they have an animatronic wolly mammoth that the kids all sit around waiting for it to move. The Ice Age show, no relation to the cartoon movie, has an animatronic saber tooth tiger come out on stage that the kids loved.PS. Have your kids wear non-nice cloths. The dirt around the museum is quite dark and black in some areas from the liquid asphalt from the tar pits. Accordingly, if your kids fall down, they get it on their cloths.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mr_Scotch
50,Excavator Tour was Very Informative,"Wandering around the museum was interesting, but the Excavator tour was the highlight of the visit. It's worth planning your visit so you can catch one.Dislike: parking at $10 was kind of expensive - you can probably find on-street parking for much less.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnmmcd
30,An a amazing fact,I wanted to show my kids and grand kids the tar pit in downtown LA for them to know that nature is mightier than any human inventions or innovations.Upon seeing the closed fence where the tar pit is located they immediately smelled the asphalt and seeing the bubbles they asked and told them that those bubbles are methane gas rising up the surface.We wanted to see the museum but our time did not permit it and maybe next time around will make time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/goldie75_57
40,Gooey goodness,It is shocking to see what has come out of the sludge. The sludge has been opened up so you can see the tar and the pits.. the grounds are great to walk and the idea that thousands.. hundreds of thousands of years ago what was here..,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/266jerryp
50,Unbelievable,"This is my single favorite LA experience. Drive down Wilshire, come to the Miracle Mile and their in the midst of it all is an active tar pit belching gas bubbles and percolating with oil and asphalt! The Page Museum that explains it all and shows you the fossils excavated from it (and there are a ton, actually tons) is interesting but I like to just gaze at the active pit. It is surreal to have this thing bubbling and gurgling away in the middle of the city and right next to the excellent LA County Museum of Art. I like to just sit on a bench and watch the action. they have a cheesy but effective scene of a mother elephant getting sucked into the pit while it's baby and husband watch in terror. I have seen birds get sucked in. When you first look at it, it really looks like a pond. There are cattails growing on the sides, but you will soon see and hear and smell the difference. The whole place smells like a freshly paved road, and once you get close you will see the heavy oil slick on the surface.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeorgeY892
40,Educational experience,"Lots of fun for kids if you engage them in the exhibits, if not they will be bored quickly. Overall a very fun and engaging museum. The exhibits did seem well kept but the place needed some dusting. I get that the artifacts are old but new dust is noticeable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aguij009
40,A special site and an interesting museum well set up,"In the original tar pit you really see the asfalt floating. A diorama at full size of how ice-age animals were trapped in this pitfall is impressive. The Page-Museum here shows all of the history and the finding of animal remains from the ice age (Mammoth skeletons, bears, sabletooth tigers) in a well set-up display. You can also see the scientists at work cleaning and recovering new findings - as the search on animal remains goes on till the present day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IWNoordergraaf
40,Fun and interesting,"We got to the museum late (like 4:30pm) so only had a half hour to walk around inside the museum. But it was really informative and interesting. We loved seeing the scientists working on current excavations and the dinosaur fossils were great. Then we walked around outside to see the tar pits. It wasn't a whole day activity, but a couple of hours. We could have brought a picnic lunch too, if we had planned in advance. The LA County museum is next door and looks fabulous! We only saw some of the outside sculptures, but I have heard its wonderful and would be a great activity in combination with the La Brea tar pits and museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lisa9962
50,Wonderful place,"This is a very fascinating and wonderful place to bring your children. They will enjoy all parts of it. I have visited three times over the last 40 years with my children then grandchildren and great-grandchildren. It is a 11 hour drive for us, but worth it. Get the kids off of the electronics and give them something worth while.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jonesc343
40,School Term Break Holiday in the States,The La Brea Tar Pits is a 6 km drive from the Loews Hollywood hotel that took 20 minutes. The skeletal remains on display were in excellent condition for most of them. The part of the museum where microspecimens were being sorted out with a fine brush and small pic looked being professionally done through the glass enclosure. My only concern is the smell of tar coming out from the various pits outside. This can overpower someone with allergy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rolandol182
40,neat museum,"I was great, especially with a child. It was different from everything else we had seen, had hands-on stuff, and wasn't too big. A very unique museum!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KVH1014
50,Very Education,"My husband and I took our ten year old daughter to visit the Page Museum and the Tar Pits on Friday, April 24th. While it was difficult getting to the Museum due to the Armenian March that was being held that day, and streets were closed off in all directions... once we arrived and made our way onto the museum grounds, we were very impressed. We had signed up online prior to our visit for the Ice Age Encounter. A 15 minute educational show, with a life size Saber tooth tiger puppet. Very interesting. The exhibits of mammoths, sloths, dire wolves, etc.. is astonishing. Who knew all of this was down there??? We also had signed up for the excavating tour, which is an outdoor walking tour, about 45 minutes long. Takes you through the who timeline of the mammals getting stuck in the hot asphalt to the bones being discovered to this day. Over 5 millions bones have been discovered since 1912!! There is a gift shop, eateries, and clean restrooms. They employees are very courteous and informative. We enjoyed our visit and recommend it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mamasculley
50,A glimpse into the long ago past.,Took my Granddaughter and two Great nephews to see the museum and the tar pits. They were enthralled and incidentally actually learned something. (Didn't use their cell phones for the entire tour!) When I was a teenager I went to see the Tar Pits and loved it. This was my first trip to the Page Museum ( I was enthralled too and actually learned somethings as well.),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janepI9693UV
30,lots of fossils and interesting museum,"Interesting museum, a little dated and run down. The asphalt pits outside were different than what I was expecting. You can see the outside grounds and pits without buying a ticket. The ticket gets you inside the museum. For the artifacts and fossils there was a lot of information posted on the walls for reading and learning the history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RonT540
40,"Not the most exciting thing, but interesting and educational","Make sure you reserve a spot on the free tour ahead of time - they were all full on the day we arrived, and we just lucked out that we could tag along. There isn't much to see if you just wander around on your own - the tourguide takes you into areas you aren't allowed by yourself. Definitely learned a lot, but you don't need more than an hour, two tops here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kallanchen
20,"Past its peak, needs revitalizing","Visited with family on the recommendation from a guidebook (#5 of top 5 LA attractions) - disappointing relative to its potential. Dated and tired facilities and displays, with mostly listless and disinterested staff. Take the time to read the exhibits and you'll learn a bit about the area and its fascinating history, but the whole thing is underwhelming and sleepy. The grounds are free and offer mostly views of peaceful black pools and puddles, along with some statues. If in the area worth a stop, but not worth a trip. Needs a major revitalization.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CollectingRocks
40,La Brea Tar pits,"We didn't have time to visit the museum. Enjoyed the tour of the tar pits, the history, and even the smell. Amazing that it is ongoing. Many volunteer to work there and some of their discoveries are noted and they talk about their work to visitors.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wandabhall
30,Very interesting pre-history,"Very interesting to see the tar pits which are actually asphalt. We walked around the pits, which are fenced off to protect visitors. The museum was small but addressed the history of the tar pits from early times to current. We happened upon a local teacher during a talk by one of the researchers at site 23. The teacher explained how when an adjacent parking lot was built, solid chucks of asphalt were found with bones.construction was halted until experts were called in to research the material and extract huge blocks of asphalt. These blocks are what researchers where dissecting at site 23. In the Page museum we were able to observe 5 researchers painstakingly separating minute material. You can watch then pick at materials using a variety of tools.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brenirish
50,So glad we visited,Great active museum! I learned a lot at a place that was hard to imagine. I had no idea that this is actively being excavated. I honestly thought it had been ripped up in the 1950s.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S3225EXjohnr
50,GREAT!,"The kids will have a ball!!! Fantastic fossil and prehistoric recreation museum, right in back of the La Brea Tar Pits. Very quiet in the middle of L.A.!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jonphil
50,Unique and informative,"This was my second visit to the Tar Pits. On my first visit we spent most of the time in the museum. On this trip I had my 4 year old grandson with me, and we did the tour which is mostly outside. Our guide, Ashley, was very knowledgeable and did a great job. The displays in the museum are well done. This is not a large museum, but for me, and especially if you are with young children, it is perfect. If you need to see more, combine it with a tour of LACMA next door.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brendalipp
50,Night at the Museum,"Did the Halloween sleepover a few years back - it was amazing, especially for the kids!Worth every penny.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JetDesigner
50,Amazing History in the middle of Downtown Los Angeles,"Hard to imagine Sabre Tooth Tigers and giant woolly mammoths walking in the middle of the Los Angles basin, but thousands of years ago that was the reality. Lured to what looked like a watering hole, countless prehistoric creatures tried to drink, only to become trapped in the sticky tar that was just below the water level. The Page Museum, and the still open Tar Pit directly in front, is a great place to spend a few hours by yourself or with the kids. Dont pass it it up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/waynegI8350QC
30,Interesting but small - additional tours might be worth doing,"I had heard of the museum while on the hop on hop off bus and I must say I was expecting a bit more. The entry fee is not too expensive, but the museum if fairly small considering this being one of the main place in the US for tar pits fossiles excavations. However very interesting and entertaining, my favourite was the saber tooth tiger, brings you back to the movie Ice Age! You can also see people in the lab working and sorting all sorts of little bones. Some additional tours are available but as other people said, it is not very well advertised so I'd recommend doing a bit of research as some of these extra attractions seem worth doing. Overall one hour is largely enough to see the museum if you're not booking any extra tours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Yannick5006
40,Nice visit for an hour or 2,"Visited during spring break with family of 4 (kids 9 and 15). Interesting to see the excavation in the middle of the city. Museum has some nice movies and exhibits. Since kids were not very interested in dinosaurs anymore, was more of a side-trip (in addition to visiting Hollywood and Beverly Hills) rather than the main attraction.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danielh5
50,Dinosaurs,This is both a park and a museum. The park has several areas where you can view the tar pits for free. The entry cost is low. It is not a big museum and can probalby be covered in an hour if you are short of time - so a half day at the most. It does have some excellent exhibits and a cool and shady space in the middle if you want somewhere to eat your own sandwiches. It does not have a cafe - but the museum of art next door does have a good facility. There is sufficient information on displays for both adults and children with some specific child orientated areas. We liked the museum visitor photos and bought ours. There is an area where you can observe research assistants working on samples and exhibits. Staff area all very helpful and friendly and there are guidedtours to some of the areas if you want more direct led information.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TeresaPrime
30,Educational,"We did learn a good bit about something we had no idea about before hand. Definitely take the excavator tour. If you just walk around the park and the museum, you will still be confused!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TammyLou
50,wow,"Here in the middle of Los Angelas is a huge park with tar pits all around. I could have stayed here all day, The museum is full of animal bones they have found in the tar pits. You can watch people working on the finds, which was interesting to my grandsons ages 11 and 13.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mary4848
50,"La Brea Tar Pits and Page Museums, American Lions who knew","This is a must see. I newer knew we had the largest fossil excavation in the world. Donate the $1.00 it is a worthwhile cause. This took us 4 hours with the two tours. Book your tours when you arrive as they become sold out. My favorite part was the outside excavation sites with the working paleontologist 7 days a week, and the ability to view the seeping asphalt. Also notable are the many large fossils, 400 skulls of the dire wolf, the pull leverages that show you how difficult it is to pull something out with liquid asphalt on it, the smallest fossils salvaged from the matrix, and the letters written in 1942 regarding suspected spy activity noted by average citizens. You can easily smell the methane gas. Your young children will love the ice age encounter tour with the robotic saber tooth cat. It last about 15 minutes. The information is repetitive if you read the info inside but it is cute and fun especially for children. The observation pit tour adds a few facts not shared elsewhere. In addition this museum is underground which is interesting. There are inexpensive restaurants to the left of the entrance as you walk out. Johnnies Pizzaeria is excellent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lv2T
50,A site to see,"You can smell the aroma of tar blocks away. Nice free walking tour of the area and park showing several tar pits that are actively being excavated. There is a fee to visit the museum which I did not visit. Methane gas occasionally bubbles up in the pond from below. I was not aware that most of Los Angeles sits 1,000 feet above a vast pool of oil. Not far away on La Brea Ave, hundreds of active oil wells are pumping out oil 24/7. All in all, a nice place to visit in downtown LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amish
30,"Hey look, it's tar.",I was kinda bored until I discovered the tar pit snorkeling adventure. It was well worth it to purchase the extended snorkel do you can swim deeper. It's not advertised very well though. You have to ask the older lady at the counter for the tour.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chrislT792WG
40,Great stop off,The Tar Pits and Page Museum were a lot of fun and educational. The kids and I learned a lot and we are glad we stopped.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BigXyu
50,absolutely awesome,"This is one of my all time favorite museums. I love natural history. Learning about the creatures from the tar pits is awesome to me.I have taken my daughter here as well and she really liked it too!!! I plan on going back every year or two for her to check it out. They have a great link to our past by visiting here.PRO TIP #1: The first Tuesday of every month is free to the public!They have all kinds of creatures here from dire wolves, mastodons, mammoths, and all kinds of other dinosaurs. Every time I am here whether it was as a child, a teen, or an adult, they have had something new and different to see and experience.PRO TIP #2: Bring a lunch so you can have a picnic. Its a great place to do that on the grass or park benches. Just be careful not to sit in/on tar bubbling up!I especially love the grounds tour where they show off all of the pits that they are currently working in. I have watched tv shows about what they pull out of the tar pits here. Absolutely fascinating. I love watching them working as well.PRO TIP #3: Make a whole day out of this and visit LACMA as well as its right next door.Parking is cheap and right behind the museum. In fact you can hit up LACMA while parking in the same lot.Overall this is one of my most favorite places to go and enjoy a day out and about exploring and learning! I would like to offer the suggestion of checking it out on your own as well...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Schel74
30,La Brea Tar Pits and surroundings,"The museum is not that big at all, the lake with the statue of the elephants, you can go in and out in about 10 minutes. Not very well taken care off, the Pits, where they are doing digging is very small, you get to see some bones, but from a far distance, they advertise more than 1 million fossils discovered, but you get to see 100 at the most. If you are planing a visit, don´t spend more than an hour in there. The museum is something that you can see in also half an hour. One hour, you are in and out!!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/doc_in_cancun
50,A rare learning experience in an urban area,"Nowhere else in the world can you see such a special opportunity to see history first-hand right in the middle of an urban area. They are pulling fossils out of the ground just a few hundred feet from the headquarters of NBC/ Universal. The indoor museum exhibits could have been better, but the grounds outside are great and to see the bubbling tar pits on one part of the path and the fossil-rich hardened tar cubes being pulled from the ground in another section is a special experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/55steve55
50,Half Day Trip,This is worth the stop. It's very informative and the guides are informative. There are other museums on the adjacent property and lots of open space. It's worth the trip.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/198tomf198
40,Very Interesting for the Whole Family!,"Our family of three adults and two children (6, 11) enjoyed the Page Museum very much. It provides one view of the discovery of many fossils of ancient animals. The docents throughout the museum were very enthusiastic and educational. I enjoyed them very much. The movie about 3/4 of the way through was great. I think it should be the first thing someone sees to put it all into perspective. The fee is a little high at $12 for an adult, but it helps to fund the museum, so I am okay with it. Parking was $10.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelerJenny8
40,Small but educational,"We visited the La Brea Tar Pits/Page Museum with my 5 y/o Son and some out of town family. The tar pit outside the museum is neat as you can see the bubbling gas breaking the surface and imagine large mammals getting stuck in there. The grounds are made up of some hills which the kids loved climbing up and down. Inside the museum there are many exhibits about the early days of Los Angeles when giant sloths, sabertooth tigers and mammoths once roamed. There is quite a bit to learn within the walls of the Page Museum, if you take the time to do so. There are a lot of neat exhibits and also some workers/volunteers that let you touch some of the fossils. They have a large window display where you can see employees working on some of the fossils and can appreciate the delicate work involved in cleaning, identifying and putting them together. There is an outdoor area in the middle of the museum which has a nice stream flowing through it containing some coy fish and turtles and is very relaxing to just sit there for a bit. There is the obligatory gift shop which you see right as you enter the museum. Take your time and enjoy this gem we have here in Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thematrix
40,Great place to walk about,"Fully recommended. It is within a nice shaded area, close to the LA Museum, and it also includes a museum (Page Museum) that has further explanations and exhibits concerning the work taking place on the tar pits and the fossils found within. Outside some pits can be seen (gratis) with some explanation included. Fun for all the family!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/expatEdinburgh
40,Paleontology + neat hill for rolling down,"A bit spooky (contemplating those poor dinosaurs, as they...well, don't think about it); enough paleontology for a few years at least, and a great hill for kids from 4 to 71.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/equally
50,A must!,"Educational to the max! Great for kids and adults, too.There's so much to learn, to take in, and the displays and their sequencing have been so expertly designed so that one can truly learn, and the subject here is fascinating.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/335williamm
40,A little gem of education,Very interesting to learn about oil fields under LA and their historical significance past times and modern-day,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/liketlab
50,I had no idea it's asphalt and not tar,"We did not go into the museum, but we walk around the park instead and were able to learn a lot for free. It's truly amazing to see these ""tar"" pits which are actually asphalt and you can see new pits forming as well as they have a love excavation going on everyday. Definitely worth a trip! The park is nice too, perfect for a picnic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PatSza
50,Free guided tours tell the story,"What an interesting place! We went on a tour of both the Museum and the Tar pit gardens outside. Our guide gave in many insights into the history of why the enormous number of fossils came to be here, the discovery and re-assembly process of the animals and the on-going work being done.The displays in the museum were very well done and the mammoth and sabre-tooth cats were very lifelike and even moved.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/525robint
50,Finally got to see this place!,"Have heard about the tar pits my entire life, and finally got to visit the place on a recent visit to LA. It's strange to think that this place is in a fairly small park smack in the middle of LA, but the park and museum are well worth the visit. How very cool to see the excavations in progress right in front of you. If you like biology or paleontology at all, the museum is worth a good two hours' visit. DO NOT park on Wilshire past 4pm or you will meet the nice people at the vehicle impoundment lot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CharlieR944
30,Just Imagine,"I grew up here. The tar pits and park were my wilderness as a kid. Times have changed as they have for millions of years. Today the Page museum shows ""what was"" millions of years ago on this very spot. It is hard to believe. The very spot you stand today once was alive with the creatures you see only skeletons of today. Stuck in the tar, natural to this place, they have been preserved for us to see today. As you see them, let your imagination try to picture what the place you stand on looked like a million years ago.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hal49
30,Brea Arm Pits,"That is what my friends and I jokingly refer to this museum. The is plenty to be learned within the museum, but it is small compared to most museums I have visited. I would not consider it a waste of money to visit, but I feel that the most interesting exhibits are those of the actual tar pits, which are outside the museum. I believe all but one of the tar pits require no admission fee. It would have been interesting to attend the one tar pit along with the museum guide, but I ran short on time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/humu1
50,Great historical place!,"Visited La Brea Tar Pits with our 9 yr old daughter and we all had a great time. The indoor museum contains many fossils that have been obtain from underground and the outdoor park provides an opportunity to actually see the places where they continue to explore AND find fossils! We also bought tickets to the Ice Age show, however, we could have skipped it. The show is geared towards a younger audience (younger children).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adriana2travel
50,See the Tap Pits!,"There were great and beautifully-designed exhibits. I especially liked the wall of dire wolf skulls. I also liked the little arboretum in the core of the museum. The park surrounding the museum was a lovely place to sit in the sun and think about prehistoric mammals,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mongo2015
50,Great Museum,The La Brea Tar Pits are fascinating and the museum was great! We were only there for an hour which was enough time to see everything. It was fun for our tween/teen boys and we all learned a lot.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/designsfortravel
50,Learning & Fun for All Ages!,"Likes - displays of ancient USA animals - mammoths, saber tooth tigers, bears, sloths, etc. with good descriptive plaques- short movie- actual dig to watch- actual laboratory work going on - watch scientists at work!- fossils of all kinds- actual outdoor tar pit with bubbling methane gas bubbles and mastodon statues- friendly, knowledgeable staff- wonderful grounds for play or relaxing- paleolithic garden made by planting actual types of seeds found in the dig sites to show how LA looked in paleolithic times.- great gift shop, full of educational books & items to compliment the learning tour. ( I""m a teacher & appreciated the gift shop items).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ASavvy1
50,"Good stop if on the West Side, Beverly Hills side of town, nearby to Science Center.",Really cool historical look at the relics of old Los Angeles. No dinosaur here but sable tooth cats and mammoths. The tar pits method of trapping animals is interesting as the site is still an active dig. Technicians are still working and cleaning additional on-going digs. Next door to some LA art museums and a modest dirve to the Space Shuttle at the Science Center.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/276kevinp
30,Interesting and educational.,"Make sure you make reservations for excavation tours on website. Beautiful surroundings, available parking unless other events are taking place at the museums, then it could get difficult.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Machela567
50,It is NOT the Pits,"Fascinating museum and active paleontology site. The exhibits inside are dated, but you can watch current work excavating and preparing fossils. The grounds and guided tours are worth a long wander through to the county museum. You can smell the tar (asphalt) and see gas bubbling in the pond!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jdub89
40,Fun...Fun..Fun!,"We went here on accident while visiting the Museum of Art. We took a nice stroll around the tar pits and saw they were doing a ton of construction. Still, the exhibits were fun and the kids enjoyed themselves. I know they are doing a lot of work to make it a lot better museum then years past so I would certainly make the trip on a Tuesday or Wednesday when not so crowded and you don't have to deal with crazy LA traffic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jonn479
40,Interesting historic place in middle of city,The tar pits are very interesting within the middle of the city. The Page Museum was very well done with a number skeletons of extinct animals that they recovered from the tar. It also has an area where you can watch the scientist take the bones out of the tar.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bruceb590
50,"Great Experience, Especially for Kids","My grandson, aged 5, loved it and didn't want to leave. He loved the sabre-toothed demonstration, films, and all the exhibits. It is a smaller venue so it doesn't take all day. Lovely grounds can be used for picnic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/susansN6501VU
50,Fun Trip w/Our 9 year old but FOR ALL AGES!,"I remember my mom taking me here when I was 4. Quite a few changes! My husband and I were recently able to take our daughter. We loved it! We did not take the guided tour but will do so next time. The museum is amazing. It is small but very well planned out and informative. We enjoyed the short film and highly recommend viewing it. The grounds are beautiful. Understandably the Lake is fenced in because of vandals, etc. This is disappointing but understand it is unfortunately necessary. Viewing an actual on-going archaeological dig at Pit 91 was a treat! Was not expecting that! This is a true GEM in the heart of downtown LA. Did not know that the Los Angeles County Museum of Art next door to Page is closed on Wednesdays (as we planned to enjoy as well). Be sure to do your research before you visit on certain days. Highly recommended.Pictures are courtesy of my 9 yr old daughter.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/V4052AHamyg
50,Absolutely fascinating museum,"Don't come here expecting dinosaurs. It is a museum of Ice Age mammals. It is also an active dig site. Make sure you take the guided tour around the grounds because you will learn so much more. The museum itself is small, but rich in fossils and facts. The reconstructed giant sloths, mammoths, and sabre-tooth cats really offer a great insight to this time period. The whole place smells like asphalt and it still seeps from the ground, which adds to the experience - watch where you step. Highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RYCA1
40,Interesting Place,"A couple of friends and I spent a couple of hours at the Tar Pits and museum. Two of us spent the majority of the time in the atrium; we watched the humming birds and bees. The museum workers took some fabulous touristy photos of us, and we actually purchased them. They were hilarious. The best part was walking around the pits outside. I get a little ADD in museums, so I was glad there were things to do outside of it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JLHeiny
40,Bubbling Tar Pits in the heart of Los Angeles,"I'd always been curious about the Tar Pits and finally went to visit. I loved the museum! There are numerous things I won't give spoilers about so you get the wow moments when you go. The skeletally reconstructed mammoths, sabretooth cats and bears are very impressive. Due to painstaking work, that you can witness during your visit, they've recovered miniscule to massive items that got stuck in the pits. It's very painstaking work and I can't imagine what they're using to get that asphalt off! There were some good hands-on exhibits, especially the one illustrating how hard it is to pull something out of that tar. The pits and museum are part of Hancock Park and you can bring a picnic. There are tables and bathrooms. The pits do smell of asphalt (which I hated) but that's what they are. I was disappointed that they are well blocked off by a high fence. You can walk on an observation bridge near the street to get a better view. The surprising part of looking at the pits are the bubbles that still erupt from below with a strong smell and noise. Our visit was 3/8/15 and parking cost $10. Not sure what the museum costs normally because we had a Living Social deal. It's definitely an interesting way to spend some time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cowstars
40,Fascinating,Painstaking work here (which you can see inside and outside of the museum) to unearth animals from long ago. The tar is still seeping up so watch your footwear! Good for an hour or two.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/greeneggs2
50,take a day,"So much to see, so much to do. Lots of walking - pleasant areas outside for the kids to ""roll"" down the hills near the enclosed tar pits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mecoh
50,Facinating outing with the family,"Excellent way to spend a couple of hours in Hollywood, CA. Went with the family on a spring vacation in 2014. La Brea Tar pits exhibits 50,000 years of accumulated fossils of ancient animals that have become mired in the tar pits including dire wolves, giant sloths, wooly Mammoths, saber tooth tigers, etc.. It also gives a history of the LA valley, complete with fauna of the time period. The grounds still have active tar pits that you can observe, open excavating pits where exploration continues, and native plants in outdoor gardens. The La Brea tar pits are also close to other major attractions like Rodeo drive, Hollywood bowl, walk of fame etc., so it's easy to fit into a day of exploring. Most locals will tell you they went on a field trip in school but haven't been back since.. We loved it..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bobn343
50,Awesome!,We didn't actually go into the museum we just did the outside walk and that was awesome! Can't wait to go back and actually check out the museum next time lol,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/765mandym
40,Snapshot of LA's prehistoric life,The Tar Pits museum is a must see for anyone who wishes to understand what today's LA is built upon. The exhibition shows a reconstructed skeletons made of bones that where found in this site. Recommended to everyone - families and grownups!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShacharD
50,A Must See!,Family fun and education at its best. Bring the family or go solo. Either way it is an excellent journey through prehistoric history.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KaraM323
50,Fascinating place in the middle of LA,"We were drawn to this place as it's featured in many a movie and it didn't disappoint. It's fascinating to see the tar pits right opposite sky scrapers full of movie executives. The musuem is really interesting, the kids loved it and it was a beautiful place to spend the morning. Maybe a touch pricey but as the operation is pretty much run by volunteers you can't complain. We had a very enjoyable time here.Recommend also the salad bar a couple of doors down for a really super salady lunch with the gorgeous people!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Australiafair2013
50,Take the Outside Walk!,"While there is a lot to see in the museum, you can actually learn a lot from taking the walk around the museum and visiting the actual open dig site. There are symbols on the sidewalk that take you to the site where they are working and will explain their finds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/5nn
50,Fun museum,This was one of the first places i was curious about upon moving to LA. I really enjoyed this museum. It has a lot of exhibits and there is often people cleaning the fossils while you watch. Pretty cool!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EliE706
50,Worth a visit -- Make sure to get the Excavation Tour and Page Museum package,"I really enjoyed the Excavator Tour! I arrived late for the last tour, but I found the group and joined up. Our tour guide, Ashley Fragomeni, was very knowledgeable and engaging. Ashley also went above and beyond by taking the time to catch me up on what I missed (after the tour), answering any questions I came up with. Talking to her/taking the tour really provided a lot more depth for the rest if my visit.The museum had displays of the ACTUAL fossils that they found. This really makes it much more exciting! They had assembled many of the bones into life-size displays. I also liked that I could lookIt was cool to see the tar pit seepage around the park. The big areas were fenced off to prevent accidents, but could still be viewed.This is an affordable, fascinating day outing. It is well worth a visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zonolulu
40,An interesting side trip when in LA,"Didn't really know what to expect, but was pleasantly surprised here. It's small, but quite interesting, and they throw in a free tour of the facility too. There is plenty of outdoor space to relax too. A good way to enjoy a couple of hours (no longer) away from the hustle. It's almost like you're not in the middle of a big city. Educational, and our daughter really enjoyed it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lionsy
30,Small but a fun visit,The museum was not as big as I was expecting and it was a little expensive. The do have some interesting displays and it's worth a trip. Not something that would take more than an hour or two.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/38lizw
40,Something Different,"We actually chose our hotel in LA because it was close to the Tar Pits. It's something different and very interesting. We spent about an hour here before joining the throngs, a 15 min walk up the road, at the Farmers Market and The Grove.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Joanne1960
50,Must see La Brea Tar Pits,The La Brea Tar Pits is a must see/do when in Los Angeles It's usually not crowded and the exterior areas are quite relaxing The displays are amazing and there is a working lab with a big glass window where you can watch scientists in action Very much worth the time to go here,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gypsytraveler01
50,An extremely unique museum; highly recommend,"We were looking for a place to spend a few hours on our last day in Los Angeles and this seemed interesting. We were looking forward to the visit, but it far exceeded our expectations. Very reasonable admission ($15), the museum consisted of the displays (both static and moving), a film about the site, an entertaining presentation about the saber toothed cat, and then a walking tour of the area featuring an actual dug pit that was left intact along with all the bones, some very interesting history about the site, and views of some of the very active asphalt-seeping that continues to happen (a surprise to learn that in fact it is NOT tar). Millions of well-preserved bones have been excavated, cleaned, and cataloged during the last 100 years, and the area will produce millions more. A museum next door did some excavating for a parking lot and in the process uncovered another huge area of bones which have been placed in boxes and are currently under excavation. A windowed display inside the museum allows visitors to watch the anthropologists and volunteers work. It's a lovely, interesting museum, and such a unique treasure in the middle of a city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sleepycat69
40,Good small museum and park,"This was a great experience and we were so glad we went. The line to get in the museum was not long. The museum is small but has good exhibits, and lots of things to see and touch for children. The Page Museum interpretive show is the best we've ever seen! Outside you can see the pits, go on a guided tour, and if you go out into the grassy grounds, you can poke the 'tar' with a stick. Inside and outside, you can see teams working on cleaning the bones. Volunteers wander the museum with bones for kids to touch. Outside, the partk offers big, open grassy areas and benches for play and relaxation. We toured the museum in the morning and walked across the street for lunch, then returned for the outside tour in the afternoon. If you go to Los Angeles and you're interested in dinosaurs or natural history, don't miss this!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/4teens
40,History,"I really enjoyed this afternoon out, it was on my bucket list and would go again. the museum was small but full of history of the Tar Pits & surrounding area. My family thought it was boring but it depends on your interests. I love the thought of Dinosaurs ect roaming around LA. Plenty of out door space for children.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elizabethhW8095HY
50,Who needs star maps when you can see Ice Age fossils?!,"If you visit Los Angeles and you skip the La Brea Tar Pits, you've missed out on one of the coolest sights the city has to offer.This site and the Page Museum showcase fossils from over 11,000 years ago. What makes this place so special is that the tar pits are still visible to visitors, and there are teams undergoing active excavations all the time. You can see real paleontologists working in the fossil lab and also in some of the sites across the grounds.The museum is small, but informative. Not only do you get to see some of the fossils that have been discovered over the years, the museum does a good job showing you the timeline of the city- you leave understanding how a vibrant metropolis developed around such an important site and what has been done to preserve it.Even if you aren't a dinosaur nerd, this place will blow your mind. Go. Just go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christinetv
50,Awesome Experience,"The staff at the museum are more than just helpful, they absolutely want you to have a great time and will take the time to make sure you do.One of the Paleontologists working on an active dig site is fluent in ASL, she took time to sign with my son and really made his day.This is an excellent place for the kids, very educational and you will see things you can't see anywhere else.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobertB840
50,fantastic site,"Loved all aspects of this small but very engaging museum. Although dated displays, it is still very interesting to walk around both inside and outside museum. My only disappointment was not having one grand visual to explain exactly how animals all got trapped in tar pits. Overall, such an incredible place in the heart of a major city. Loved seeing the volunteers doing their work on the excavation sites. Also, appreciated how much of the museum was open to public for free with displays and descriptions all around outside on the grounds. What a great educational institution.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carrie_clb_111
50,Must-see,"Great visit to this site. Park in the museum lot ($10) - street parking is tough. Go around the sideo f the building to the entrance - we went up and down the stairs by mistake. Nice museum with a film explaining the ""tar pit"" and a walking tour of the area. You can see oil bubbling out of the ground. Great outing for kids. Guides will do waling tours on a frequent schedule.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/den979
50,Stinky,"The place smelled like hot tar but was full of lots of information. Seeing prehistoric animals up close and personal was a treat for sure, especially for the kids. Love putting history in our vacations. Did not have time to take the tag on tours but enjoyed our visit none the less.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suecC4863MA
50,Excellent,"The first time I saw this museum, Me and parents got here late and had to rush because they were closing in 45mins. Now seeing it again with a group of people from the Natural History Muesum from San Diego was great. We had a great guided tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jackiem729
40,Great for kids and those interested in natural history,"The Page Museum is much improved since my last visit. The exhibits were interesting and appeal especially to families with kids and natural history buffs. The new ""fishbowl"" exhibit where you can watch fossilized bones being cleaned is neat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karendX3471EP
50,Getting stuck in LA,"We have driven by the LaBrea Tar Pits a thousand times without stopping to look. Our 2 older grandsons wanted to see them, so we finally went in. Wow!! We were really impressed with what we saw! Millions of years ago, and even today, asphalt oozes up from under the surface to form a smelly goo that has trapped thousands of animals. In a couple of areas, squirrels still do get stuck. But its the prehistoric animals that are fascinating. Saber tooth tigers, wolves and mastodons among others walked into the ooze and couldn't get out. Thousands of them!The exhibits, skeletons and information are all well laid out and narrated by videos and many docents who are there to answer your questions and give you more information on the site and the animals. Children and adults will be fascinated!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dryFlyfisher
50,Loved it!!!,I've always wanted to visit the La Brea Tar Pits ever since I learned about them in elementary school. The museum was very educational and had so much information available. The displays are amazing. And just walking around on the grounds was interesting as well. And the parking was not bad at all. We just parked at a meter not even a block away. Will definitely go again if I have the chance.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/teamvanderwood
50,Wow! First ever visit..you must visit at least once!,"Did you know..it is asphalt,oil...not tar! No dinosaurs ever recovered there only wonderful mammals dating back 65,000 years. Giant sloths..thousands of Sabertoothed Cats..Mastodons & Mammoths..Dier Wolves and yes camels..horse types..many bird varieties. With a membership you only need pay for parking $12 across the street. Tours and special events are covered and photos are discounted. On site recovery of fossils is ongoing. Oil still seeps above ground entrapping more wildlife and plants for future individuals to dig up long after we are all gone. Come check it out for yourselves.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/24ktgold
50,Educational and fun!,"Parking was a breeze and upon entering, knew it would be great. The displays were very informative and left me in awe of what had occurred all over LA so many years ago. The bubbling pit out front lends a real live idea to what the place was and what occurred. A must see in LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KnoxEater
50,What a great place,Excellent experience. Very interesting exhibits and displays. Beautiful park right in the middle of the concrete jungle. Traffic can be difficult but worth the trouble. Very reasonably priced. Fun afternoon.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/618lynned
40,Fun quick outing,"I didn’t have plans one morning so I decided to walk around here. I didn't go in to the museum so my review is just about the grounds. It was actually pretty interesting to learn about the history. There is a path outside of the museums where you can go around and see the active and inactive dig sites. It took probably about two hours to look at everything, depending on your walking and reading speed. There’s also public bathrooms in front of the museum. There is a small parking lot. It was within walking distance of where I was staying so I didn't have to use it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GetAwayFromBoston
40,Nice surprise in the middle of LA,Have always heard about the Tar pits so it was good to finally go. Would be a great place to bring kids if you have them.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cblaiz
50,Fun day,"Something I've always wanted to see, mostly out of curiosity. Not disappointed. Got to see the bubbling tar lake and the museum was pretty neat. Lots of skeletal remains that have been discovered in the pits, lots of information. They take pics of you upon entering the museum so you can buy at the end of your trip thru the museum. The way they take the pics, they look like you are in a tar bubble, scared of a saber tooth tiger, etc. Fun pics that you just have to buy! $9 each for seniors to enter the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mariecQ6910CV
50,Fabulous for adults and kids.,"Went reluctantly to this museum because my husband really wanted to go, I'm glad I went! It was thoroughly well presented, impressive easy to understand video presentations, fascinating exhibits and beautiful park surroundings. Most of The children in the museum were fully engaged with the exhibits. Outside kids were playing and just behind the art museum we had a good cup of chia and piece of cake.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/406kerryh
40,Nice park and Museum,Very educational. We had not planned to visit by came across it on our way to Rodeo Drive. We were pleasantly surprised on the exhibit. The staff was friendly and would possibly try to answers any question that you might have on the exhibits.We happen to come on the day where there was free entrance and was offered to donate $1 for the archaeological works..... of course we obliged,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ZalizanI
50,Good & stonky,"Visited the La Brea tar pits park on a beautiful sunny day. Was very surprised to see that there is still tar bubbling to the surface. I thought the tar pits dried up years ago. They have a fenced-in lagoon with mammoth sculptures at both ends to show how animals became trapped in the tar. Cool to watch new bubbles forming and emitting stinky methane. Great information and fossils inside the museum. Interactive displays, moving animals, working lab on site. My only disappointment was in the museum shop. Lots of things for kids, nothing for me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/86calgary
30,Bones bones bones,"It really is amazing to see all the prehistoric bones found right in the middle of LA. If you like dinosaurs and history you will enjoy this museum. The day we went it was free, however, there is generally a fee to get in. The museum is fairly small which makes it easy to get through. There are interesting facts all over. Many schools were there with the small children. This is in a large park so pack a lunch and enjoy the park itself. There are also current excavation pits that you can see. Parking was $10, but there was plenty of spaces and very easy to get in and out. It is in the same area as other museums, so make a day of it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/debtaylor
40,FASCINATING!,"As soon as we planned our trip to LA from NYC we knew that we wanted to visit the Tar Pits. I bought my tickets online and paid the extra for the excavator tour which takes you to one of the pits that had recently been reopened to the public. We were a little disappointed because our guide was extremely boring. In fact, a few people on the tour had to correct her on more than one occasion. We ended up leaving the tour and shortly after, saw others leaving as well. The museum itself was small but filled with a lot of information. I would definitely recommend this attraction to anyone interested in this time period. However, I would try to find a more enthusiastic, knowledgeable guide.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelmommaNyc
40,Good time,"This attraction is very nice for a respite from the busy city. Price for admission is not too bad. The little one loved seeing the mammoth and being able to run around on the grassy fields surrounding the museum. Lots of info and skeletons to view. Everyone in our party was happy with the trip. FYI, parking was a pain on a Saturday.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mikesil41
50,Prehistoric life in the city,"You thought there were beasts in Los Angeles, now...You should see the previous residents!The museum and tar pits are a wonderful place to take small children. My 5 and 3 year old grandson and granddaughter loved the exhibits. They were as excited about this as they were about a trip to Disneyland.There are no dinosaurs at the Tar Pits. The remains are mammals, birds and insects (an area of prehistory often overlooked).A visit to the Page Museum and the La Brea Tar Pits in an informative 1/2 day excursion, and could be a counter-point to a tour of the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History (they have lots of dinosaur remains).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/994JamesH
50,"Great place for ""tween"" boys","Looking for a cool place that 7-13 year old boys will love, look no further than the Page Museum at the La Brea Tar Pits. When you enter the grounds you can walk around and see the tar pit and you can walk the grounds to see a dig site. In the museum, there are skeletons of prehistoric animals and some very informative displays. My grandkids loved it! The other plus is it is next door to LACMA and they have some really cool, interactive sculptures on their grounds the kids enjoyed. Food is just steps away from the entrance at various restaurants.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/debbbiew
40,Interesting!,"We stopped here, jumping off the hop on/hop off bus. All I knew about the La Brea Tar Pits was that they existed and that the Flintstones mentioned them a lot! It was really cool to see in the middle of the city, and to learn about all the animals that got trapped. I think this would be a great place to bring kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SLT1962
50,take the tours,"Interesting history and well versed docents guiding the tours, both indoor and excavation site. Both are included in the entrance fee. Time well spent. Right next to LACMA too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mjk_39
50,Who would imagine such a place in the middle of a large city...,"Bet I've driven by the La Brea Tar Pits, located near down-town Los Angeles, CA, 100's of times without stopping to see the museum there. Finally took the time to stop while on a trip with my husband and our friends. The museum is small but packed with animal, bird and insect remains all taken out of the still ""bubbling"" tar pit. We stood near the fence around the pond and watched methane gas still bubbling up from the small lake's depths. Learned a great deal about the animals that once roamed the area....for instance I didn't know lions and a one humped camel were common to the area in the past (I had always thought they were only know to be located in Africa - obviously incorrect). There were mastodons, horses (larger than the ones later brought to the New World from Europe) , saber toothed tigers, a very large wolf, a sloth, a large flat-faced bear and so many species of now extinct birds plus many beetles and other insects no longer here. It was very interesting to watch volunteers separating items from the continuous digging by archaeologists on the location....such tiny pieces...like trying to put a terribly difficult jig saw puzzle together. There were movies to watch and you can take docent run tours but we didn't have the time to do this. Wishing we had though. Will plan another stop there next time we're in LA. This is a great place to take your children for an educational few hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/byebye2u
50,LOVED this place.,We spent a really informative morning here. Not only did we learn about the fossil excavations (which are active and ongoing) we learned about the history and development of the area. Really fascinating stuff with informative tours and shows.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ABL71
40,Nice day amidst the asphalt,"As I learned in the museum, asphalt bubbles to the surface, not tar. Brea is the Spanish word for tar. Over the ages animals got trapped in the muck and their bones were preserved- well enough that there are many skeletons on display in the museum. Rather neat was the wall of Dire Wolf skulls as well as the sabertooth cat. The brief behind the scenes movie was also enlightening. We walked around and saw Pit 91 where a great part of the finds have come from. I also got out of the museum without having to shell out money for souvenirs for my 4 year old, so that was a plus as well! Glad we did it. I had passed by this site many times when in LA and finally got to learn more about the La Brea Tar Pits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kt3
30,Underwhelming,"I've always wanted to attended the tar pits but by jingo they were underwhelming. Interesting, intriguing but underwhelming. It's great for 8 year old boys and that's about it. What I did enjoy was the wall of wolf skulls and being able to see volunteers painstakingly put bones back together.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/timbX493ZC
50,Unique and Fascinating Attraction,"You don't have to be a paleontologist to be captivated by the La Brea Tar Pits and the Page Museum. More than 5 million fossils have been excavated so far and the excavations will continue for years to come. The goo (asphalt) trapped all sorts of critters from the Ice Age and preserved them in an astonishing state. The Page Museum is a masterpiece with an informative video, excellent exhibits, and even a viewing area so visitors can see paleontologists at work. If you've never seen an American Mastodon, Columbian Mammoth, Saber-tooth Tiger, or Dire Wolf, here's your chance! Take the whole family and imagine Los Angels as it was 30,000 years ago. Open 9:30 to 5:00 daily.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/680alanr
40,Nice museum.,"We visited the museum after spending an hour walking around the grounds. It was very well done with some interesting exhibits, but our kids were quickly bored. It is probably more interesting to younger kids who are thrilled by large and extinct animals, and to adults who enjoy paleontology. Our kids better enjoyed walking around the grounds and seeing the tar pits, which my wife and I found more enjoyable as well (and free).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ERFSU82
40,Amazing fossils,"The displays are educational and pleasing to the eye. It is kind of small, took only 1 hour to see everything but worth seeing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/460katinas
50,Very educational and a great way to spend an afternoon or a whole day,Found the pits and the associated museum to be extremely fascinating. Spent hours looking at the exhibits after which we toured the LA Art museum located adjacent.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DickH940
50,One of the Highlights of our trip,"Although this museum is small, it is wonderfully laid out and was very informative. Our family really enjoyed every aspect of our visit. My suggestion is to arrive early as once it was more crowded it was more difficult to maneuver. The staff did presentations that were great and you could tell they were very passionate about their jobs. The tour was nice as we visited some of the outdoor areas and got more information. We also did the Ice Age Encounter and while it was an added cost the kids found it to be cool. Overall it was a great experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SFJoshuaM
40,Mammoths and mastodons,Fascinating place – best bit was seeing the tar pits themselves (actually asphalt) and imagining how this place must have been before Los Angeles. Kids will enjoy it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RebeccaT509
40,on the road,"The one of many things that we really wanted to see In Los Angelus was the La Brea Tar Pits and the associated museum. The pits are a fossil record of the area animals. It was surprising at the number of fossils that have been removed from the various pits. Our docent was very knowledgeable and answered all the questions satisfactorily. We spent about an hour touring the Page Museum and found it to be very educational. Walking around the park we observed several areas where tar is oozing from the ground. The lake is quite active with gas bubbles breaking the surface continuously. It is very unusual to have a feature like this in the middle of an urban area. If you make to LA, take the time to visit the pits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tomsteffek
50,Bringing Direwolves to life,"Really glad we came here. I had only scheduled 2hr for this visit as we had limited time in LA. I wish we had more time! Even 3 hrs would have been better. I had to skip reading quite a few placards. Fortunately, one of the associates there (a friendly young lady from Melbourne, Australia) was giving a talk on Direwolves but ended up giving us a quick personal tour, explaining a lot of the Tar Pits' history and current work.If you're interested in the ice age (NOTE: no dinosaur bones here, it's the ICE AGE) and seeing a lot of well preserved fossils, as well as watching staff working on piecing together micro-fossils (the world's tiniest jigsaw puzzle, really fascinating to watch), then you must go to the Page Museum.Unfortunately we had to leave early and missed the Excavator tour of the Observation Pit (free with museum entry). But it's so amazing to see a real, live, working fossil excavation right in the middle of LA!I can see how some people might be bored with this - it's a museum with fossils and a lot of placards to read, but we love the ice age, fossils and archaeology so it was great for us. Little ones might be excited by it (if they're fans of the Ice Age animation series). There was giant mammoth, sabretooth tiger and a ground sloth. I was amazed at how big the sloth was!Fans of the Game of Thrones series will be disappointed at how small Direwolves actually were in real life. But it was still amazing to see the whole wall of Direwolf skulls.It was easy to get to from Universal City. We caught the red metro to Wilshire/Western, then as we came out from the escalators I saw the 720 rapid bus already there, heading towards Santa Monica (free transfer for us). The Museum stop (Wilshire/Fairfax) is just after you pass the museum, so you have to walk back a little bit. The kind bus driver told us where to get off. The whole trip was surprisingly fast, perhaps 40 min...definitely less than an hour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MayW15
40,"Unique, interesting and worth the hour or so","Have wanted to visit here just because of the location - right in the City of L.A.You can see the bubbling lake for free with the distressed elephants sinking.We were there on our go Los Angeles card - I remember thinking the price for the four of us looked a little high for paying direct.It is nicely laid out and we found staff very keen to share some of the history with us. Giant sloths, short mammoths and 400+ wolves trying to enter the tar pits for a free meal.We found parking around the streets easy enough and it only cost $2.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LozzaCam
40,Bizarre place in the middle of the city!,It's a pretty strange thing that such a place with such history lies right between all these buildings.We had a nice afternoon visit in the museum. Took time to read and see all the things.Defenitely a place you should visit when on a road trip! LA is so much more than just the regular touristic stuff.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dominique_en_Erik
40,Asphalt Pits,"We learned that tar is a man-made substance and asphalt is naturally occurring. The asphalt and gas and still coming up, the museum is great and this is a live archaeology site.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aarond712
50,Great learning experience,"This is a must see if you enjoy history. Fossils are amazing and we learned so much. The museum is very well maintained and all the docents well educated and want to interact with the visitors. We enjoyed seeing Pit 14 where they are still extracting fossils and watching them work. I am not a celebrity hound, so this was a great",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IcedTeanCocoa
50,Have ALWAYS Loved This!!!,"I have not been in years. I used to take my children when they were small. Recently took visiting family there. It has gotten even better!! Take the tour, where they talk and show you about the excavation pits. A lot of interesting information. Park in the underground Museum of Art next door and just walk over, if parking is an issue at the George C. Page Museum. You can actually watch them working on finds and cleaning up the bones. FANTASTIC!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DebbieR720
40,Gooey education,"Such an interesting part of LA history among all the glitz and glamour! It seems so out of place, yet there is this prehistoric relic that still amazes people today. The museum offers more details and facts about the tar pits and the ongoing research taking place. Very educational and historic - worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/697dianneh
50,Don't miss it,"We almost did. We got to the museum about an hour before it closed and about 2 hours before we had to be at the airport for our flight home. We were all so glad we made it. The museum is small, but very well laid out and informative. The docents are enthusiastic and engaging. The displays are terrific, giving you a good idea of the quantity of skeletons that have been found in the tar pits as well as the variety. A room where you can view people working on the most recent items extracted is interesting. There is also a brief explanation of some of LA's history and how the tar pits were first used/discovered. The walk through the park to view the actual pits, was a little bit of a let down, but still interesting. There is also a spot where you can observe excavation, but that was closed by the time we got there. One of the best things, finding a gooey tar spot in the grass while we were cutting across the lawn...it's everywhere!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cesejs
10,No parking,I would give you an experience about the museum if I was ever able to find parking. Drove around the block twice in hopes to find street parking and drove around the parking garage that said the first floor was full to find that the entire parking garage was completely full but they were still letting traffic back up to get in and drive around for no reason. Complete waste of 30-45 minutes to end up with disappointed children in the back seat. You would think with the Art museum right next door that they would have more parking for both museums.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jenm993
50,Excellent,what a great story who would have ever known 200 tons of skeletons have been recovered and still growing,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/212ricks
40,Short and sweet,"The Page musuem features animals that were discovered during excavation of the La Brea tar pits. Most of the animals are from the Ice Age and not during the dinosaur ages so you will see Saber tooth cats, mammoths, dire wolves, and ground sloth fossils. Worth a visit as a member since you get access for both here and the Natural History musuem.The musuem itself is small and you can walk around it in 45 min or so. Also has an atrium in the center that offers a relaxing respite. You can go on an excavation tour which walks around the outside of the facilities and you can see the actual excavation pit with fossils and tar.My kids enjoyed outside the musuem as well as it is beautiful to walk around and also to roll down the grassy hill.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Allmotorking
50,An Ice Age Museum,"You'll find out what's the difference between dinosaurs and ice age animals...Not too big museum, but you also can see many tar pits where they found the fossils..Check out the museum website to find a parking spot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dianti25
50,Great place to bring the kids,"Inside, the museum is full of interesting displays. Outside, see active tar pits and ongoing excavation by paleontologists. A mild warning for visitors...the parking lot has some small cracks in the surface where tar oozes up, so check the kiddies' shoes before they accidentally track tar into the car or house following your visit. :)We visited in August of 2007 (not 2014).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sc00tert00ter
50,One of my favorite things in the Los Angeles area,"I am in my 70's and have a daughter who loves living in the LA area. I love my daughter, but for the most part, I'd happily live without visiting Southern California. (I live in Minnesota, and I even enjoy winter here. That makes me weird, but it's the truth.)The Page Museum is WONDERFUL! When I was a girl, the popular comedians of the day made fun of the La Brea Tar Pits, but the joke is on them. This is a great place to learn and visit. I make a point of coming here during most of my visits to LA, and it never disappoints. This time I experienced the Ice Age Encounters, and sat in the front row. The ""Smilodon"" (enormous Saber toothed cat) walked right up to me and roared. YIKES! But a great experience.As a member of the Minnesota Historical Society, I was able to receive free admission for myself and another adult. So, make a point of asking if there is reciprocity with any museum back home. You may be pleasantly surprised.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H7356EVnancyd
40,Interesting and unusual museum,"It's an interesting place to visit because it's so unusual: the tar (technically) asphalt pits were a unique trap for Ice Age/Stone Age animals, and the museum focuses on animals and specimens that were found right on site. The fact that the tar pits themselves still exist makes it that much more interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mschmidt31
40,Good for small kids,Interesting for small kids. Good few hours visit. Very informative. It's hard to find parking. Free parking on few side streets after 3pm.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PngHop
50,"Outside Grounds Free, Inside For All Ages","A delightful surprise. Outside grounds have several active ""tar pits"" where you can watch liquid asphalt rise up from the earth and and underground ""gushers"" of methane filled bubbles explode. Would highly recommend visiting the Page Museum before walking the grounds. Inside get tickets to the Ice Age Encounters ($3ish) as this will set up what you will see in the museum - wish we had done this first. Suitable for ALL ages even the wee ones. Upon leaving, there is much to explore/see. There are no DINOSAURS - they died millions of years earlier. A nice mix of artifacts, history, and actual people sorting thru bones and artifacts. After head outside to walk the grounds, the elephants in the tar pit and lions at the entrance will now make sense. Kids will enjoy the green grass, hills, and animals to climb on. Dogs are welcome in the outdoor area and the grassy park. Parking across the street is a flat $12 rate. Be sure to pay immediately as you park the car - otherwise you'll be standing in a long line at 5pm waiting to pay. No attendant - you'll have to pay at a kiosk. Couple of cafe's closer to the art museum but extremely slow and a sandwich is $12 (expensive). About 15 food trucks are lined up just across the street on Wilshire (at Fairfax).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SayCheese
50,Asphalt Seeps,"There have been changes at the Page this year. They are excavating at Pit 91 again. The Observation Pit has been cleaned up, but unfortunately you have to take a tour to see it, but earlier in the year it was usually closed. Ice Age Encounters, a life size puppet show of a Saber Tooth Cat, is fun for the kids. Inside they are still working in the Lab with big picture windows so you can watch. This is the only place in the world where they dig up old fossils in the middle of a city which makes it easy to visit. There are a dozen or so large animal skeletons and many smaller display cases of Ice Age animals. I learned they are not tar pits, they are asphalt seeps. There are no dinosaurs but you can buy some in the gift shop.There are five other museums within walking distance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KennethL828
40,Good for a kid for a few hours,The exhibits are pretty good and the staff is very knowledgable and passionate. Lots of things I've never seen anywhere else. Ok neighborhood with other museums and whatnot nearby.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eja117
40,The tar pits view is free...,"Located close to the LA County Museum of Art on Wilshire Boulevard, you can walk right up to the smelly tar pits for a view and photos. Nice area for strolling as well. We did not go into the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jan_from_Atlanta
50,Very different,Visited here in 1980.Lots of interesting birds and plants.At the entrance was large Elephant in Tar Pits.Of course they were not real. Interesting place to visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dskeens
40,What an awesome place to visit,"We were very impressed with this small museum. What a pleasant surprise, we enjoyed looking at the recovered skeletons of the animals found in the tar pits. The coolest items to us were the remains of a saber tooth tiger, so incredibly awesome. The museum is small and quaint with a gift shop. We arrived 1/2 hour before closing and purchased a book in the gift shop about the tar pits and walked around and snapped photos. We wish we would have had more time. You really only need about an hour or two to see the museum and the tarpits. There was a $12 per person fee. However since they were closing soon we paid 1/2 price admission. We used Uber to arrive at the museum so I am not sure about parking at the facilities. There are restrooms in the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Curiouspb
50,Scientific Truths,Proof that the earth is billions of years old.A truly amazing experience.Terrific exhibits with many animal bones to examine.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pjhooray
40,"Fun place, glad we went","This is a fascinating, active archeological dig and museum right in the heart of LA. The museum explains the history of the tar pits and how they trapped and preserved the animals. There are some cool fossil displays and good educational displays for the kids.The museum wasn't quite 5 stars but it was fun. The ice age video was fun for the kids, but if it is just adults I'd skip it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/314BryanB
40,Interesting to see an active site.,"The La Brea tar pits are an active archeological dig. The day I went there was no one actively working, but you could still explore the site area and view the dig area. You probably have to be interested in history to find this exciting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/whereto2next
30,Great exibits but was ok,I was expecting a little more.. That been said the Page Museum is not very old so we may understand why there is a lot less exhibits compared to other museums.There was a few great stuff but as I said it is pretty quick to go around. Although I love the area where you can see on what archeologists are working on.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I1824AHmariab
30,Dutiful Visit to the Tar Pits,"I say 'dutiful' because it is one of those places that you want to like, a family place but, you but truth be told, it's boring and limited in what it has to offer. It's nice that the people who work there on the whole seem to be passionate about what they do but it still didn't really engage me. I can check it off my list (been to Los Angeles a few times). Sorry Tar Pits!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elizabethg156
30,It's ok,I went with my young son and it was ok. Yes we saw the tar pits and did the museum. Near by there is an art museum. But I don't know if I would go back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CaliPeachR
40,My husband loved!,This was an amazing experience right in the middle of the city. We enjoyed all the history and the wonderful information provided about this incredible find.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SherraLin
40,Good time,I have loved going to the tar pits since I was a kid. The museum is nice but they could update some of the videos.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christyreznor02
40,Dirty,"Other than the fact that this site was less than totally clean, it was fantastic. Much info about creatures long gone!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarmichaelVentura
50,"Wow! Fascinating Interactive Museum and ""Active"" Tar Pits","Fascinating experience! My husband kept mentioning the La Brea Tar Pits. After researching Trip Advisor and La Brea (""tar"") Pits, I had to see this or rather the thrill of ""tar pits."" The Page Museum did it and is a well-planned indoor/outdoor exhibit and museum. A visitor can make this easy/non messy (with no effort) as we did while still experiencing this eye-opening museum. Small fee ($12.00) for the museum - definitely worth it. Don't expect a lot of huge dinosaur remains - but there are a few, and many smaller specimens and a theater presentation.Outside we simply walked in the park from the south street side (no tickets) and around the lake with thick, black, bubbling tar continuously emitting methane gas bubbles. These bubbling bursts may range from several inches up to a foot in round bubbles, before disappearing and sinking into the black lake. Life-sized prehistoric model animals ""stuck"" in the tar lake illustrate the trapping of the animals thousands of years ago. This is a living, timeless outdoor exhibit. I hate the smell of tar, BUT there was no continuous, overwhelming tar odor outside or inside. I was all around that lake taking my photographs (through the fence) and this area didn't have a tar odor that would have been annoying. Nearby on the grounds a concert was in progress.Inside the museum has staff/docents leading demonstrations and telling the story of the tar pits and primitive mammals, birds, and saber tooth cats (not tigers we are told). Children and adults were mesmerized by these educational lessons allowing visitors to touch the teeth of the recovered skeletal remains. Lab workers were working on this Sunday afternoon in November and I was surprised to see this on a weekend.Parking in the Page Museum lot was full so parking on the street with meters was the only option. However, about 10-12 street vendors in their trailers on the south side of the Page Museum were actually a fun part of this experience as so many varieties of food were available and sitting among others on benches on this beautiful afternoon was perfect. We didn't notice any tar leaking through cracks in pavement and this must have been in another area. We didn't seem to miss anything here (inside or outside) - and my suede shoes escaped any tar in this perfectly manicured and clean outside/inside area.As an added bonus: this is next door to the very cool LA County Art Museum and the Peterson Automobile Museum. There are more museums and sites - a great area to see and enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RikiUSA
40,Unique specimens - cool ice age bones,"Best collection of ice age bones I've ever seen. Presentation was pretty good, with the ability to view the actual process of excavation and preservation. The introductory movie needs to be updated as the animations are pretty primitive.Plan to spend about one to one and a half hours at the museum and walking the small grounds. Park on the street if you can instead of in the museum lot to save some money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/55xxx
50,Some Great Exhibits and Specimens,"This was our favorite stop in LA. My wife and I enjoyed walking around the tar pits, and visiting the museum. There are so many well preserved specimens, and some interactive exhibits too. The history is all very interesting, and the price wasn't bad. Out on the grounds we saw asphalt bubbling up in random places. Don't wear your best shoes, just incase you step in some.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Captain_Paulie
50,Checking out the Tar Pits in LA,Excellent venue with so many interesting artifacts and exhibits. So glad we went and spent some time there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G3900XTchriss
50,I'm a closet paleontologist ...,"... so you can guess how this one goes!I've wanted to get to the La Brea Tar Pits for a long, long time. Finally, on this visit to LA we did it! My wife is not exactly a paleontology fan, and even she enjoyed her time there. We parked on 6th Street, north of the museum (metered parking), and walked into the museum/pit complex.The pit out front is amazing, spitting out occasional huge burps of methane gas. But the displays in the Page Museum are amazingly helpful in telling the prehistory of the site and its accumulated fossil specimens.And the collection of full-skeleton prehistoric fossils is amazing and well-presented and described. The wall of dire wolf skulls is astounding!If you care at all about ""secular science"" (the only kind of science of any value!), you will want to see this attraction - and see it survive and thrive!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LarryM708
50,AMAZING!!!,"For starters it was only 15 dollars for the museum, a tour, and an interactive movie... what!?! The exhibits are amazing and really informative, you get to see employees and volunteers digging and sorting through the muck, and the pits are still very active. Its a great day and you have to visit if you are anywhere near... oh, the parking was atrocious, but I think it was because there was a pet adoption festival happening.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elisabethmoe
50,Very unique history,The tar pits and Page Museum is a very important and unique historical sight. The tars pits are still bubbling. Inside the museum the tar preserved animals bones are one of a kind anywhere in the country. You can watch workers sort thru the preserved debris for the remains of mastadons to insects. Behind the museum are boxes of recently excavated tar with bones that are being extracted. You can get a guided tour of this process.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fredj158
50,History surrounded by the city!,"As soon as you step out of you're car you can smell the tar, parked on a road nearby as the carpark was expensive, millions of fossils have been found in these thick, bubbling holes, and they are still finding them everyday, on site there is an Atrium with tropical plants, a tar pull where you can try and pull a pole out of the sticky tar, harder than it looks! A huge wooly mammoth and a wall full of wolf skulls, we also did the outside excavation tour with a pretty blond girl wish I could remember her name as she was so passionate and informative! You get to see different pits and people working and still excavating up close, well worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoeL247
40,Interesting museum,"Very interesting place. Loads of fossils and displays with detailed information explaining what your looking at. The most interesting bits to us were the viewing area where you could watch the staff cleaning bones etc and doing all of their science stuff to them in the lab. The other highlight was the tar pit excavation area which is a minute or so walk from the museum across the park. Seeing the process of how they actually find the fossils was very interesting. All in all, a very interesting piece of history right in the middle of a city, in nice park like grounds. The museum is cool the way it is built into the ground. The information on how the museum came to be is worth a read. The outdoor mini lake with the animal statues is cool as you can still see the tar bubbling up from it if you stand and watch. And a gift shop, something for everyone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/whanau_travels
50,Can't believe this is in the middle of Hollywood!,"I grew up in Riverside, and had been to LA and Hollywood multiple times, but had never been to La Brea tar pits until now. Following the GPS made me laugh as we were right in the middle of Hollywood when it said we were there. The park is small but nice, and the museum was free (I believe Tuesdays are free... but check before going). It wasn't a long stay as we had arrived somewhat late after touring Warner Brothers studio- but we did get to poke around the museum and check out some of the excavation sites. Very cool place if you like dinosaurs and natural history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christinehN8626TP
30,Not particularly impressive to me,"I expected to see a lot of fossils, and I did. The exhibits were very nice. What I found most interesting were the old pictures showing how the tar pits were first mined for the fossils. And it's not actually, tar, it's asphalt. The pits themselves just looked like big muddy holes in the ground, with occasional bubbles coming from them. The grounds are beautifully kept and it's a nice place for a school field trip. When we were there, there were quite a few busloads of kids from grade school through high school visiting. Individual parking is okay, but the buses must park on the street and it's difficult for them to find room. There is nowhere to get something to eat except for a couple of vending machines. So if you plan to spend some time there, bring a picnic lunch. I understand there are wheelchairs available for rent on a first come basis, but we didn't see any when we got there. I would not have wanted to push a wheelchair up the hilly walkways, either.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dragongourd
50,I go so hard for this place.,"...where to even begin. I loved this place. The museum is just straight+up on point, the staff is cool, and the exhibits are fantastic. No lie: I spent like five minutes just staring at the animatronic sabre-tooth cat/giant ground sloth exhibit. It was mesmerizing.The dinosaurs in the tar bath outside? Genius. I just...if you're in LA, skip the rest of that Walk of Fame stuff (they're just tiles with people's names on them, people!) and do this first. It's a must.TIP: The walking tour is decent, but a bit long & the info is basically the same that you would get if you read all the info inside. Skippable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jsleos
50,Saber Tooth Spectacular!,"I recently visited the La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles…..a dream I've had for nearly 50 years! It was fantastic! We stayed there for almost 4 hours and I could go again tomorrow. I actually want to go live there and volunteer to work….it's awesome and well worth the time and money to go. I have been reading about this place since I was old enough to check out books at my library and I've always wanted to see real Saber tooth tigers……that's what they have at La Brea and lots of them. They are amazing and there are more found on a regular basis. It's a great place to visit and a wonderful alternative to another day at an amusement park…..the kids will be entertained while actually learning something worth knowing. I'm a science teacher, so I'm a little biased, but this is a top of the list place to visit in LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/katbird55
50,Always wanted to go here,"I've always been fascinated by the La Brea tar pits, and decided to go there when we had a couple of days in Los Angeles between trains. It was even better than I had hoped. The museum's exhibits all came from the surrounding area, there is an active lab studying the fossils that are still being recovered, and much to my surprise there are still visible tar pits (fenced off to protect the unwary). We were lucky enough to be there when a free tour was offered, which was very informational.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Solotravel-lover
50,Tar Pits and Fossils,I have always wanted to see the tar pits and was delighted to visit the museum in the park! The museum was excellent and allowed a behind-the-scenes view of fossil preparation along with displays of multiple fossils recovered from the pits. The Dire Wolf skull display was totally impressive. Don't miss this one.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CharlesR71
40,Very interesting place to visit,"If you are interested in anything prehistoric, or just like history, this is definitely a place to stop while you are in L.A. The Page Museum houses many of the fossils of the animals that were found in the tar pits. They are still uncovering more animals today.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JCR68
40,La Brea Tar Pits,I recently visited the La Brea Tar Pits located in Los Angeles. I cannot speak for the museum as I only walked around the grounds observing the various active tar pits. I was amazed to find such a geologically significant site in the center of Los Angeles. This is definitely worth the visit even if you only have 30 minutes to spare.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jaci405
50,Very Educational,"I loved this museum!! We had not originally planned to visit the tar pits, but unexpected changes landed us here. The exhibits and the history of the area is amazing. I particularly enjoyed the chance to see the paleontologists up close and personal working on various projects. The lake pit directly in front of the museum is a sight to see. To this day, asphalt and methane continue to bubble up from the underground vents and you can't help but watch. I found myself imagining how this area must have appeared back during the age of the animals discovered at this site. La Brea boasts that it's the world's only ongoing urban Ice Age dig and it's right in the middle of L.A.. Whether you're inclined to be a bit of a history buff or not, I think everyone (young and old) and get something out of a visit to this location.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Soonersports
40,Makes you realise how much things can change in 10 to 15K years,"I found the exhibits good, the size of the Columbian Mammoth is staggering, and the sheer number of recently (geologically) extinct animals is sobering. Hopefully a reality check for those that believe climate stands still (regardless or warming or cooling debates). However the number of exhibits and size of museum was much less to what I was expecting. The admission price is a little on the expensive side, especially considering that most of the outdoor stuff is free. Add car park fee and it is an expensive day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ozthunder
50,Interesting,Free! Great place for a look. See the fossils they have recovered and how they do it! You can pay a small fee for a guided tour if you like but we did it on our own and loved it :),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/932barbarac
50,Awesome,"I grew up in awe of the Tar Pits so when I got the chance to see them in person, it was fantastic. Right in the middle of the great city that is LA, don't miss this for a great time of learning.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tonytsheng
40,Fun and Interesting,"Went to this museum with my three kids (7, 4 and 3), it is not so big that they get tired and there is a lot of interesting things to see and stories to tell. They specially enjoyed it because they watched the Ice Age movies and some of the skeletons where of those animals in the movie. Adults enjoy it too. The story behind the fossils are really amazing. Outside the museum is a big area where the kids can run and play. Next to the page museum is the Lacma, but we didn't go in because the kids where very tired and hungry.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LuaA1982
40,Great mix of history and exhibits,"With an impressive variety of dinosaur skeletons and statues, this is a kid wonderland! There is a nice mix of history, scientific explanation, pictures and exhibits to wow the kids. My little dinosaur enthusiast loved every minute!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SouthernSister1
50,Great learning experience for children,"I took my little sister here. She really enjoyed learning about the various types of ancient animals and dinosaurs found in the local area. I found the history of the area and the Tar pits very fascinating. It has been a while since I have visited the page museum. It has improved greatly since I was a child. I like that tar is still Seeping up and people can see how easily animals could get stuck. We observed people excavating at the site and they were very friendly and answered our questions. This place is located next-door to LACMA and many other museums. The Grove ,the farmers market, is a short drive away where you can find plenty shops and places to eat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jan_Medina
50,Must see!,My husband and I went here. We had to go to the area to run an errand and just happened by it. It was well worth taking the time to tour and visit. Its so crazy to think that those tar pits are still bubbling. And to think of of those animals and remains that they have found and are still finding. Would highly recommend this yo anyone! Great for all ages!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ashbeck77
50,A bucket list check-off,"I have wanted to see the pits since I was a child, and living in Minnesota made that more of a challenge. This summer I had the opportunity to do so and was not disappointed. Pretty cool that they are still pulling bones out of the place with a seemingly never-ending supply. You can see actual tar pits with animated statues from the sidewalk. The entrance fee is reasonable and they gave me a discount (either AARP or AAA, can't remember which one). Nice walking around learning more of what takes place there. Would definitely come back if I had the opportunity.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pitufo00
40,One of the most interesting places in Beverley Hills,beverly hills is much over rated and this is a globally important site which is passed by very often. It could do with some TLC but nevertheless this should not be missed. Signage is not great but it is near the art museum. Good for children especially.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MikeE624
40,"Review of the grounds, not the museum","My wife & I made a quick stop here on the morning of our drive to Vegas as it was kind of on the way. We didn't have enough time or interest to pay $12 each for the museum on top of the $8 parking so instead we just looked at all the tar pits that you can see for free in the surrounding park, which range from huge ponds of the stuff through to tiny little holes that are creeping through the surface. There was also an excavation pit that you could look at which was really interesting, along with plenty of little signs and information boards which explain the history and current state of the pits. There aren't many places in the world that you can see something like this, so it's well worth taking the time to stop here for an hour, even if only on your way to somewhere else.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Scruff_UK
40,Cooler when I was a kid,"But still cool! But some of the creatures, like the sabre-tooth d tiger, were much cooler when I was young. Good neighboring museums.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarmichaelVentura
50,"The real stars in LA are 30,000 years old","Mammoths, dire wolves, short-faced bears, ground sloths, American horse & lion, even dragonfly fossils. You can see volunteers cleaning and sorting microfossils in the ""fishbowl"" lab. You can also see an active excavation outside, but watch were you step, asphalt still bubbles to the surface.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RomanaDvoratrelundar
50,Treasure trove of prehistoric fossils,"Wanted to visit here since I was a kid and finally got the chance! Since prehistoric times, tar has been bubbling up through a fault to create tar pits in what today is Los Angeles. Prehistoric animals became trapped in the tar which has given us an amazing find of fossils. For me, the most amazing part of my visit was seeing the actual still-bubbling tar pit in front of the museum.The museum itself is not huge and can be enjoyed in an hour or two. There are skeletons of mammoths and sabre-toothed cats. Though we came as a couple, this is a great place to bring kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rlennon1
40,Worth a look,Walk the grounds and you will see lots of active tar pits. Museum was ok need to know what ticket gets you access to what exhibits.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MyQuality
40,Fun & interesting,We had an afternoon to kill while in LA. Since we were staying near downtown we decided to visit the La Brea Park & Museum. It was 4 adults and we all enjoyed the museum and tour. We learned a lot and the guides were very knowledgeable and fun. I highly recommend this as a great side trip.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vidalia1954
50,Pits and Fossils,What a great place! The tar pits had interesting displays and lots of distinct scents. The museum was interactive and informative. It was stocked with thousands of objects excavated from the tar pits. We were surrounded by fascinated kids of all ages!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MissMem
50,great place to visit,"This was such a great stop on our Los Angeles trip. We caught it by accident when we passed it on the highway. We didn't get to the museum, but, were able to see the tar pit. Unfortunately, my husband decided to stick his finger in the tar and couldn't get it off!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hawkins30102
50,A Trip Back in Time,This was a spot that we had wanted to visit during our weekend get away. I enjoyed being able to watch researchers clean the bones and how they had diagrams showing how much of an animal had been recovered. The trip easily occupies an afternoon. We had a great time walking through looking at all the animals that called CA home in the past.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R6588GYgregs
40,Good and different activity,"The LaBrea Tar pits are right besides LACMA. And the Page museum is within it.As others mentioned, the museum is a bit expensive for the price. However, they offer free guided tours. If I had taken the tour, it would have been worth the money. On the day that I went, the tour was at 11:30 and it didn't work with my planning for that day. I would recommend to look at tour hours and factor that in when you go.The museum itself was small and tacky but neat for children. We watched both films, as I felt they explained well the situation to children. The first one is a bit scary because it shows animals eating others, but they really understood what happened onsite thousands of years ago.There was volonteers to answer all questions and that had mock versions of the animals bones and faces and jaws to touch. The wolf craniums are impressive. There is also a place where you can the 'paleontogist?' work. They are in a sort of bubble while they clean up dirt and find bones and fossils.On the outside (free), you see the tar pits and pits 23 and 91. There is also the bubbling tar and the excavation work. This was the highlight for me. If you have the tour, you can also go down in a pit. I wish they would have had more boards with instructions and a marked pathways. The 'paws' they have are not easy to follow.Overall a good morning that differed from what we normally see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zaz936
30,Decent attraction...,"For years, I have been wanting to take the kids to the tar pits every time we were in the LA area. Finally got a chance to, but it was a bit underwhelming. The actual tar pit was interesting, but I was expecting a lot more tar in the lake. The bubbling in the water from natural gas fissures under the lake was neat. The Page Museum was definitely a bit overpriced for such a small museum. There are some cool fossils to see and a lot of dire wolf exhibits, but we were done in half an hour. The LA Natural History Museum is a much better place to visit. Stop by if you've never been to the tar pits. At least you can say you've been there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sharka_boy
40,Interesting place! Hard to find,"I really enjoyed my afternoon at the tar pits! I'm from the UK and was passing through LA on a road trip. Herd about there being a place where they found sabre tooth cats, had to go! I thought the museum was a little pricy for the size. They have some great fossils and the dire wolf wall was pretty amazing! I myself have never seen anything like these natural tar pits the exhibition about the excavation wasinteresting! There is a huge fence surrounding them to stop the silly people who want to climb in! Which is a shame. So much history trapped inside a small place! It only gets 4 because it's hard to find and a little expensive!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ffionb2013
50,Surprising!,"The Page Museum is small, but has a lot of history. There are some volunteers explaining the expositions, and you can also see people working in the paleontology museum. The expositions have fossils and materials that scientists found at the tar pits. You can visit the museum and less than 1 hour. After that, you can walk around the park to see the tar pits, and there are people working in some of them, so you can watch them. You have to pay an admission to get into the museum, but you do not need to pay anything to see the tar pits. Paying the admission fee you can have guided tours through the tar pits, so it worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Poly_grr
30,Cash Grab - just wander around the grounds,"We visited recently with two kids (5 & 6) and the kids could have cared less about the paid portion of the museum, which by the way, is quite small and disproportionately pricey ($5 for kids, $12 for adults - plus $9 for parking). A few pictures of your group are taken just inside the main door, and on they way out they are offered to you for purchase for $30, which is outrageous!The highlight for the kids was watching the koi in the pond in the arboretum inside the museum (which they also did for free at the Grove).The attractions are geared towards older kids, or true fans of prehistoric animals.There is a great wall that depicts the evolution of life on earth in the last room. I could have stared at it for hours. Fascinating.The grounds are free to roam around, including a working pit, with a visitor's centre built around it. Included in this free centre is an attraction that is also in the paid portion of the museum - an exhibit that reveals how heavy and sticky the asphalt (not tar) really is. This was also fun for the kids.Beware of the asphalt deposits all over the place on the ground. It's very attractive to kids and has the potential to make a real mess of shoes, clothes and hands.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hibiscus99
40,Where Evidence of Evaluation Has Been Trapped in Tar,"This is a great place to bring your family or just yourself. The park is huge and the garden is just wonderful to walk through. The off street parking is $9 but there is plenty of meter parking around the park. If you can take the tours, this is where the real learning begins. I personally thought the museum was small and could use more dioramas. There was a wall of over 400 Dire Wolf skulls. I would have liked to see the evaluation of the wolf skulls showing how the wolf has been getting smaller over time. Oh one more thing, watch were you walk in the grass, there are seeps of tar coming though the park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Crynwolf
40,Right in town...the Pits,"We stopped by the Tar Pits and the park and the city has done a great job of explaining the history and science behind the bubbling tar. The park is clean and safe and there's concerts offered, so check the schedule.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JimH_Tarheel
50,Nice mix of history and science,"Quick and easy destination. You get a nice walk around the park to see active tar pits, then the Page Museum delves into these pits and shows you some amazing and cool things. There are two movies rooms, skip the first (by the entry) and go see the second (by the exit). Be sure and wonder around the courtyard.The LA County Art Museum is on the same grounds and has a nice outdoor restaurant and cool outdoor features.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IntotheWideBlue
40,Interesting stop,"Finally got to go to see the tar pits, which are still active.Very interesting story about the guy who started the joint and he came to California.Since historical visit while visiting LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/756joannel
50,"Educational, interesting and fun half day out","We were not expecting much but joined a inside guided tour, then the paid for tour of the pits followed by the spare toothed cat presentation. A most excellent afternoon....we learnt so much and it works at all levels of the family. A must do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/baguette15
40,Learning and Fun all at the same time,"The Tar Pits and the Page Museum are beautifully maintained. It was a great learning experience but lots of fun at the same time. The life size replica models both inside and outside the museum are awesome. The Sabre Tooth Cat display which changes between the life size model and the skeletal system made of fossils is really cool. I had a hard time getting my 3 year old son to move from the wooly mammoth exhibit. The nuggets are information are amazing and it takes a stretch of imagination to consider all these extinct animals lived, breathed and moved right here in southern California. Definitely worth a visit,.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShankerB
40,Tar Pits,"I've been wanting to go to the tar pits since I was a kid, just never made it despite many trips to the LA area. Its an interesting museum, so much I didnt' know about the area. If I'm perfectly honest, I was more looking forward to the tar pits, which are outside and available to view free of charge. But after coming in, its worth it to better know what it is that you're looking at in the pits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chrisitout
50,"If you love fossils, archiology, you'll love this place.",We had a great time and learned a lot too. It is also right next to several art museums... they have live music outside on some days.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidwZ8047WC
40,Very interesting,"Lots of information and interesting things to see. Plenty of walking trails, indoor and outside things to do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BarbieD91
50,Sucks you in!,"My wife and I went and found it very interesting! It's fun to know where all these fossils seem to be coming from. Huge finds in these tar pits affecting the world around. Take the kids and learn some more. Only about 1 hour to go through the whole thing, but very interesting! We used our Pacific Science Center memberships from Seattle to attend this museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/guyk839
50,Fun for the Family,What a wonderful Museum and park. Our family enjoyed all the bones that were found right here in a big city. The displays were wonderful with help from the staff as they saw you they came over with displays to teach you all about that animal that was found in the Tar Pits. We walked all over the Park see the excavation sights and the places that pop up around the park grass with tar. Hard to imagine that the buildings are sitting on tar with more bones to be found. You should not miss this when coming to the Hollywood area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tappeterson
20,Disappointing and small,"This was probably the only disappointment of my entire trip to America! It was my own fault because I was so excited about it before, but the website makes it seem that there is a lot more to the museum and tar pits than there actually is.The tar pits are smaller than I thought they would be. There are some models of animals in them which look cool but I thought there would be more. They are surrounded by a very tall fence which obscures the view somewhat, although I appreciate that this is to stop people climbing in. The tar pits are in the small (and nice) park around the museum which is open to the public for free so I wish we had just done that.The museum was $12 each which I thought was a really good deal until we walked around it in about 30mins because there are only a handful of rooms. The skeletons and things on display are well done but in the UK this would be a free local museum paid for by the local council. The shop was small and expensive and didn't have the things in it I had seen on the website and wanted to buy (I had done a lot of pre-planning for this trip!).It was terrible but I was left disappointed and wouldn't recommend it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/311florenceg
50,Great place to visit over and over again,"My sons started going to The Page Museum since age 2. One of my boys loves Sabor-Tooth Tigers. The other loves Big Mammoths better. Even though they may not have understood the scientific & historic significance of the amazing discoveries there, they were still able to appreciate the beauty of the fossils and what these ancient animals would have been like. To the kids they were almost like the imagination's best friends. You have evidence of something amazing, and yet have all the room in the world to bring that alive. The museum is relatively small but with plenty of things to see. My boys now can watch long documentaries with boring scientific talk without a problem, and they want to be archeologists when they grow up. My 5-year-old regularly goes to the blackguard looking for ""dinosaurs fossils."" Page Museum is a must-go for families with kids of all ages.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clm777888
50,Excellent for all ages,This is one of the most interesting museums I have been to. All staff were friendly and very informative and the exhibits large and well presented. Everything was explained very clearly and the kids loved seeing the modern day tar lake and 'puddles' around the park. A wonderful slice of history!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WendyP381
50,Informative and interesting,"We really enjoyed our visit to this museum. It was fascinating to see the ongoing work in both the fossil lab and Pit 91. We learned so much about fossils and life ""way back when"". The museum was clean and well planned out. Staff was pleasant, helpful and full of good information. Seeing the actual tar pit bubblying outside was really cool. While you can view the grounds for free, it is worth it to pay the fee to visit the museum. And, be sure to ask about ""extra"" programs - some were free and some were not but we weren't aware of them during our visit and therefore, missed a few things we would have liked to have done. We were so glad that we decided to give this museum a try.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travel43_11
40,Interesting and well worth a look,"I only had a quick stop at the tar pits and museum as it was almost closing time, but grateful for it. The amount of fossils pulled from the tar pits is unimaginable and to see once living creatures reconstructed for viewing amazing. I especially enjoyed watching new fossils being cleaned and worked on in the lab. An overall interesting and enjoyable visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/550ryanl
30,Smelly,"Had high hopes for this museum but left a little disappointed. While interesting in what has been discovered on the site over the years, there is very little on display. The outside tar pits are still bubbling out methane and seeping asphalt so it does smell. Overall I had expected more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/911shaneb
50,One of the best parts of LA!,"My boyfriend and I visited the Page Museum and Tar Pits in August, and it was one of the best parts of our trip. It was just fascinating!We weren't expecting to see so many real fossils from ice-aged creatures...and we definitely weren't expecting to find a Paleontology Lab where we could observe the cleaning of these fossils. It was brilliant. We learned so much!We will definitely visit again when we are next in Los Angeles. If you get a chance to go, please don't hesitate.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travellingbibi76
50,So much to see and not enough time!,I made the mistake of trying to fit LACMA and the Page Museum into one 5-hour visit. So of course I spent more than my allocated time at LACMA and didn't leave enough time for the Page.Do the short video and the tour to get your bearings and historical overview.Fascinating!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DaisyQ3
40,Fun and Informative,"We had heard good things for years about this venue. It is beautifully laid out, but quite confusing. When you enter the parking lot you have no idea where to go, We found that one way was where workers are digging and there are a couple of exhibits and in the other direction there is the Page Museum. The digging area is free, the Museum is not. In fact, they have several charges depending on what you want to do. If you just want to look around on your own it is one price, more costs if you want to see a movie, take a tour, etc. Walking around and looking at the exhibits and talking to the docents is very informative. There are some awesome skeletal and reproduced mammals. You can easily spend 1-2 hours just touring those areas. They have a large gift shop which has typical high prices to support the museum. A large variety of items, though. Outside you will find a fenced off old quarry that bubbles gas and floats tar. Fun for a one time visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tvgrand
50,Just fantastic!,We loved the Page Museum and the Tar Pits. There was so much i didn't know! I really enjoyed the exhibits and seeing the actual dig in pit 91! You will really enjoy La brea and the Page Museum!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/frankiep269
40,Great Family Experience,"We took our six year old daughter here as part of a family museum vacation. We all LOVED it. It was just the right size for us to see everything during the morning, educational and not crowded. Staff was super friendly and helpful, the facilities were clean and exhibits well organized.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Berlynblue
40,Unique Museum,"This museum is unlike any we had ever been to. The grounds of the museum have various tar pit digs with staff working to identify prehistoric fossils. Inside the museum, staff and volunteers work to clean and catalog fossils and microfossils. They have a huge collection of these fossils from animals that got stuck in the tar pits. The only downside is that some of the special shows and demonstrations sellout so you have to reserve your spots early. You may want to consider becoming a member of the museum as they have reciprocal relationships with other museums like the Natural History Museum of LA and it could actually be less expensive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trippin00
30,Tar-rible,"Let start of with I have always wanted to go see this since I was a little kid so I had high hopes, how ever those hopes were soon stuck in the un escapable tar. Admission is 12$ Soon as you enter there is a early early '90s movie you can watch. Skip it. The museum was not bad it was just really really really small, you can walk through it in 5 minutes if you don't read the descriptions. . They have some cool complete skeletons, but that's about it. They said they have found ver 600 species in the tar, I felt like 20 were at the museum. There was a boring indoor atrium with no signs explaining what the plants were. How ever they do offer a tour with admission. BUT! The tickets need to be reserved online as they don't have any available when you get there. , super lame. The park was nice and it was almost the best part of the visit. I think the natural history museum has more tar pit displays. All in all it's not worth 12$ unless you get the tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bubbaskyjacker
50,From the macro of mammoth to the micro of mouse toes,"Ever since I heard Bugs Bunny mention the La Brea Tar Pits, I've been intrigued, but going there was even better than I could have imagined. This is one fascinating place. It really helps create an understanding of time--and it's not all about the past: creatures are still caught in the asphalt (oil plus sediments). The tour was fascinating, as were the exhibits, as was the chance to watch a volunteer sort tiny bones and shells from grains of sand. It really goes from the macro of a mammoth to the micro of mouse toes. As an adult, I was fascinated, but it would be equally fascinating for any child over the age of four. It's also a lovely location to spend some time in the outdoors and a wide variety of food carts on Museum Row provide many lunch options at a low price. An LA must-see for sure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kathy_Quimby
50,Small but very interesting,The Page Museum and associate La Brea Tar Pits is a small but very interesting look at Ice Age fossils. More Ice Age fossils have been recovered here than anyplace in the world and are still being recovered. The highlight are the fully reconstructed skeletons of the huge mammals of the time. (If your kids have watched the movie Ice Age you can relate the characters to the real thing here!) There's also an interesting history of asphalt mining and oil drilling from the Native Americans though to the modern days. We and our 'tween' children enjoyed very much.This is a small but very well done museum that can be covered in an hour or two. $9 for adults and $5 for children under 12. Parking lot in the back (i.e. to the North) of the museum grounds for $9. The Page is in a larger museum complex with LACMA that is worth exploring as well. There are a good number of gourmet food trucks parked here and a restaurant and shopping complex (Museum Square) just east along Wilshire.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/steveprez
30,Bubbling under,"The hook was the bubbling tar pits which I recently got inspired by that daft film Volcano starring Tommy Lee Jones. A lot of the film has bubbling tar pits as well as bubbling lava.The tar pits preserved all sorts of animals from mammals to sabre toothed tigers. The accompanying museum has all sorts of displays and fossils as well as having a room where you can see the scientists working in the lab. The museum element was so-so, some of the exhibits are of the kind you can see in other natural history museums although these museums do not have a tar pit on their back yard where many of the specimens come from. I found that once you factor in the price for parking, entrance charges it adds up to be less than value for money although the tar pits can be viewed and smelled for free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PrestonGuild
40,Interesting for all 5-65,We went during the heat of the LA summer and the tar (asphalt) was great to watch bubbling. A really interesting set of exhibits too. It's worth going on one of the free excavator tours.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/12TravellingG

40,Fascinating,Great place to see an active dig site in a huge city. Wandering around the pits is reminicent of driving down a road that's being paved. It's startlingly smelly. I was really surprised at how active the pits are and saw lots of bubbles and movement in the large one near the Page Museum entrance.Had fun listening to the guides talk about the work they do and how much they have found and continue to discover.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eva_atl404
40,Pretty neat to see,"You should go the park first, and get an understanding of the area, then go to the museum. Not the most exciting museum, but wild to see what they found in the pits. It's unreal all those creatures were roaming around LA at one time. Very interesting.Neat to see the lab at work. A good history lesson of the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Randy2353
50,Classic LA museum,"This is an experience well worth the trip for any visitor to LA or for residents of the area. If you have no interest in the past, perhaps not but if you have any curiosity about the past and what was here on this piece of earth, this is a great place to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chingachgook
50,"Ancient fossilized lions and tigers and bears Oh, My!","Museum [requires an admission fee] + grounds [free] reflect a look at Los Angeles 50,000 years ago to include evidence of climate change having taken place along the way.Visitors can browse through the museum which includes fossilized bones of ancestors of modern day animals such as elephants, tigers, wolves, and bison. Color coded illustrations of individual bones show the locations of these structures as they would appear on an intact skeleton.There is also an excellent orientation movie and an opportunity to view the ongoing work of separating, cleaning, sorting, and identifying specimens in the museum's fossil lab.Admission price included a guided tour of the grounds and current excavation sites, Pits 91 and 23. Guide was knowledgeable and informative.Planning tips:Purchase admission tickets + reserve your tour time by making these arrangements online.Arrive early.Determine how long you want to visit before deciding on where you will park. If you choose metered parking, be careful to check the signs to avoid being towed.Bring your cameraEnjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/46Lil
40,More for older kids and adults,"My husband and I and our 11 year old son enjoyed the tar pits very much. Our active 8 year old active son did not get as much out of it. Pit 91 was very cool because you could see the active diggers at work. Going into the museum and learning more about what was found and the history of the pits definitely gave context to the walking tour. I also recommend a ""Stuff You Should Know"" podcast about the tar pits before visiting. This will help orient you. There aren't many hands on things for young learners so younger kids or those not into history may be a bit bored.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/schussles
50,Great Afternoon adventure,We spent the afternoon at the La Brea Tar Pits and the Page museum. The docents were friendly and knowledgeable. The exhibits had both an overview and detailed information. The layout makes it easy to see in an afternoon and then going out to see them digging at pit 91 was the topper for the afternoon. Nearby restaurants made for a nice food break.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JamesJOceanside_CA

50,Tar Pit Adventure,"Lived in LA most if my early childhood and never visited much of the local attractions other than the theme parks. We always like to visit places that were not traveled by others as much and now I live in one of those quiet beautiful places.But making a 3 1/2 hour drive so my kids could see something different was a great pleasures or the hole family. This is a must see place for the kids to learn the difference between fossils and Dinosaurs.Just be careful to not get tar on you our as my young son said "" I did not get tar on me, just wanted to tar some of the park with me"".Take your family it's a must see and stay to see the other things in LA that you didn't do as a kid.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/962PhilK
50,VERY interesting,"This museum and the surrounding park were a highlight of our trip to LA. It was a refreshing change to visit a 'real' attraction rather than something from Hollywood or art bought in from elsewhere (though there are some very good art museums in LA of course, including LACMA next door!).This is not a dinosaur museum. The tar pits have preserved animals from more recent history (mammoths, saber tooths, etc). There are some great speciments on display- very impressive. The short interpretive film is well worth watching and the displays are very well put together. It is not a museum that you need to spend hours in, being relatively small. 2-3 hours is likely to be sufficient for most people.The highlight for me was actually seeing the scientists in action. They have a glass fronted lab that allows you to see them at work studying the fossils. There are also a couple of exhibits in the park where you can observe the scientists getting the fossils out of the tar and working to understand the jumble of bones. The talks/tours by museum staff are very informative BUT you need to book in advance to be sure of getting a spot. If you are short on time and dollars you can walk in the park, where the tar pits are very clearly visible, for no charge.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chalk_11
50,La Brea Tar Pits - A Short Educational Stop in the Middle of LA,"I have always been fascinated by Dinosaurs, so the La Brea Tars Pits and the Page Museum were a must see for me. (The tar pits outside are free, but the museum has a fee.) I loved the La Brea Tar Pits; yes even the distinctive bubbling, smelly tar pits caught my interest. It was so interesting to see some archeological sites (especially Pit 9) that are still being worked as you watch. The grounds are park like with plenty of areas to relax, and once again is free. The Page museum has an entrance fee; the museum has impressive collections and informative displays of the fossils which have been found in the tar pits. (I would suggest paying a little extra for the movie.) It was so surprising to see the vast number and variety of animals caught in these tar pits. Even more interesting was a glassed-in lab which is centrally located in the middle of the museum where you can watch several scientists and even students actually working on the fossils that have been found in the ""tar pits"". Allow at lest two hours for the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/117carla
10,Membership is a real rip off!,"I grew up in Los Angeles. In fact, I spent quite a bit of time at La Brea Tar Pits, and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (which is still wonderful by the way). What an absolute heartbreak when I decided to take my grand daughters for a new experience here.I no longer live in California, but my mother does and she has a lifetime membership to the LACMA. However, we decided we were going to go into the Page Museum so the girls could see the dinosaurs. When we went in the prices were high, which we were going to pay. However, my mother was asked if she would like to sign up for a yearly membership. It was $85. She quickly said yes, until we discovered that the membership only covered the members of the party who were standing there right at the moment, or whomever she happened to write down on the paper (one other adult and up to 3 children I believe). It always has to be the ""exact"" same people to use the membership entrance!Honestly, who always goes to the museum with the exact same people? Especially, in a place like Los Angeles, CA. Anyone, other than those on the list would have to pay full price. What a rip off! This includes the Museum of Natural History by USC as well. Again, ridiculous. I have been to the museums many times, but I cannot say always with the same group.We thanks the young lady and saw our way out. We then went over to the LA County Museum of Art where my mother has a membership that does not require ""specific"" people. We had a wonderful time.It was not the money, it was the principle. There are better ways to make money for the museum than extorting it from folks who want to have an educational day out with the kids. Shame on you Page Museum...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CynC777
40,Fun and Interesting,"Price of museum also includes guided tour. It would be best to set up your tour on-line ahead of time, otherwise the time slots may fill up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/643karent
50,fascinating,"This was such an interesting place to visit- lots of great information, the wall with the hundreds of dire wolf skulls really showed the volume of animals caught in these tar pits. Not too long- great to see Pit 91 & see them scooping tar & bones showing through the tar",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeffV887
40,Educational Day Out,"Tar pits were a very good educational day out, and gave a good insight into early Los Angeles. Couple of tips; bring food/drink as there are no facilities (though nearby outlets) and tickets are $9-$15 so be aware of that. Overall worthwhile, but gave it 4 stars based on cost and experience",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/QuixotixAU
40,Fun and unique site,"There is no where else in the world that really matches the la brea tar pits in archaeological terms, so it felt very special to be there. Very interesting for the most part, but not enough to fill up a whole day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/batmaz
40,Great to see!,"Spacious museum with many cool exhibits, inside and out. We got combo tickets with the Natural history museum which turned out to be a great deal. Seeing real scientists at work was also a plus.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trevorb643
30,Saber-Tooth!,"Fun little museum - lots of big teeth! I was surprised to learn of the animals that once lived in the LA area. The tar pits outside are free to see, the museum has a fee. In the centre of the museum is a glassed-in lab where you can watch people working on the bones that have been found. There are bigger/better museums in LA but this one is worth a quick stop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tralmix
50,What a cool exhibit!,"I loved the La Brea Tar Pits and the Page Museum. It's such a funky little park -- bubbling, smelly tar pits -- in the middle of LA! The museum breaks down the significance to make it all very accessible to the visitor. You don't need to be a paleontologist to understand and appreciate their significance. Even my mom who does not enjoy museums really liked the exhibit! The docents strolling around were very informative and helpful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hleahh
50,Free To Teachers!,Thanks LA for yet another museum that is free to teachers. Just bring proof since it's not posted. Beautiful exhibit and lovely grounds. We even enjoyed a short nap on the grass after a long day of touring.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SlyGuy21
50,Educational and fun,"The Page museum has impressive collections and informative displays of the fossils found in the tar pits. It is an active dig, so you can actually see scientists at work. The displays had just enough detail for more scholarly visitors as well as hooking younger and more casual visitors.My only complaint would be the parking...we accidentally parked in the nearby shopping center rather than driving around to museum parking. Minor hiccup, but hopefully this will save future travellers the extra expense.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Megasaurus-rex
50,Excellent!,"Great way to spend a couple hours with kids. The museum is small, but has a few interesting features, particularly the horseshoe-shaped glass room where you can watch scientists at work cleaning and investigating bones from the pits. There is a short movie which is helpful to watch before your visit. Take one of the free guided tours which visits a working pit. There isn't a cafeteria on site, but a number of places for lunch near the museum. There are a few locations on the grounds where you can see the asphalt oozing up from the ground (look for the caged areas; big and small). Also, in front of the museum be sure to take a look at the pond covered with a layer of asphalt and methane bubbles bursting on the surface. So weird-looking, especially in such a highly urban location!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BooKat
30,La Brea worth visiting,Visited the museum today with my four home-schooled children and it was enjoyable. A good tour in the grounds of the park showing the original pit and talking about current work. Quite good overall.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/326angiet
40,worth your visit,my family enjoyed seeing how the staff would work in the pit to extract bones from extinct animals. It is a beautiful place to see and worth your stop. Educational. There is no zoo there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chaplain1992
50,Great afternoon,This was a fun afternoon. Fun exhibits and the outdoor area is really well kept and interesting to see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EricaBarnhart
40,"""History Lesson""","“La Brea Tar Pits (or Rancho La Brea Tar Pits) is a group of tar pits which formed Hancock Park.” La Brea Tar Pits is a registered National Natural Landmark.The “pit” originally started off as an asphalt mine. The “black tar” has been seeping up from this ground for tens of thousands of years and over the centuries, animals trapped in the tar pit were preserved.The George C. Page Museum was built next to the tar pits and is dedicated to researching and displaying specimens recovered. Construction began in 1975, and the museum opened in 1977.The oldest known material was that of “preserved wood,” dating back some 38,000 years ago by the “Radiometric” system. Today, the tar pits are fenced off to protect visitors and animals from falling into “the pits (No pun intended).”The “asphalt” turns the bones of the deceased animals a dark-brown or black color. The lighter fractions of petroleum would then evaporate from the asphalt and leave behind a more solid substance, which encases the bones. The asphalt also preserved microfossils such as wood, skeletal remains of rodents, insects, mollusks, plants, seeds, and pollen grains.The Native American “Chumash people” used the natural resources of tar to seal the cracks of their canoes.Important milestones:1769; The Portolà expedition, comprised of a group of Spanish explorers and led by Gaspar de Portolá, made the first written record of the tar pits. Portolá would christened them Los Volcanoes de Brea ""the Tar Volcanoes"".1901; Oil geologist, W. W. Orcutt was the first person to recognize fossilized prehistoric animal bones that were preserved in pools of asphalt on the Hancock Ranch. To commemorate Orcutt's discovery, paleontologists named the La Brea coyote (Canis orcutti) in his honor.1924; Hancock Park was created when he donated 23 acres to the County of Los Angeles with “stipulation that the park be preserved and the fossils properly exhibited.”1913 – 1915; over 100 pits were excavated in search of prehistoric animal bones.1940’s and 1950’s; Public excitement grew of the recovered “large mammal bones.” Further study revealed the fossil vertebrate material was well preserved, with “little evidence of bacterial degradation of bone protein.”1970’s; Research shifted to smaller specimens, i.e., insects, plant parts, and microfossils, such as pollen grains and uncovered the history of the Los Angeles basin during the glacial age, which revealed a cooler and more moist climate back then.“Methane gas escapes from the tar pits, causing bubbles that make the asphalt appear to boil.”2007, UC Riverside researchers discovered the bubbles were caused by hardy forms of bacteria embedded in the natural asphalt. After the bacteria consumed the petroleum, the bacteria would release methane. Of the bacteria sampled, about 200 to 300 were previously unknown species.2009; Formal announcement made regarding the “2006 discovery of 16 fossil deposits.” The remains discovered were that of clams, millipedes, fish, turtles, saber-toothed cat, wolves, bison, horses, and an American lion. Also recovered was a nearly intact mammoth skeleton and the only pieces missing is a rear leg, a vertebra and the top of its skull, which was sheared off by construction equipment during the build of an underground parking structure.A partial skeleton of human remains were also uncovered and was dated back to approximately 10,000 years (~9,000 radiocarbon years). The remains were dubbed the “La Brea Woman.” She is believed to be between the ages of 17-25 at the time of death.Our visit;Over the years, our family had planned this trip but never made it until the summer of 2013. One of our main reasons for not visiting this place was the “nightmarish” traffic just trying to navigate through this city of millions who calls it home!Then again, you would’ve never thought this place existed because it’s located in downtown Los Angeles, between Wilshire Blvd and W. 6th Street! I first discovered its existence through my “AAA” tour guide of the Los Angeles area!In this concrete jungle, sits this museum and park and if you were just the casual driver, you would not have noticed this place ever existed.It was fascinating to just walk the grounds where prehistoric animals once roamed and to actually see their skeletal remains displayed was a thrilling experience.The Pleistocene Garden had life-size replicas of extinct mammals depicting what life was like back when they roamed this area. Our children learn something every time we travel and learn about the culture or history and this trip was no exception.We also got a chance to actually see the volunteers working in the “pits” doing whatever they were doing and covered in black tar. Our group was told that the volunteers were closely supervised by a Paleontologist.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Holdtheair
40,At your own pace exploration!,"The museum and Tar pits were really cool to experience. So amazing that all of these ice age fossils are right in the heart of LA! I went with friends and their three year old twins. It was a great place for all of us. There is a lot of hands on stuff for kids (touching skulls from saber-tooth lions!), educational theater, photos, maps, fossils and you can even watch the paleontologists and volunteers working through Tar matrix's to unearth fossils! The Tar pits were neat to look at. You can watch them bubble as the gases escape from the earth. There is also a lot of land space for kids to run off some of their energy. Definitely recommend spending a couple hours here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SunniK
50,Fascinating place!,"My kids, 10 & 5, are mini paleontologists - they really enjoyed this place. Younger one thought the Ice Age Encounter was too intense, so we left early; I was sorry I couldn't see the whole thing. There was so much info there-they especially enjoyed Pit 91. Two people were working in the pit that day. Parking was $9 for whole day, so we also walked down to the Petersen. Two thumbs up from my kids",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LisaM253
50,Returned to see it again...,"Went thru the entire museum..visited a ""dig site"" on the property....loved it all!!!! So interesting for all ages!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Markate47
50,Can't believe this place does not receive Govt funding,"This would have had to been my most memorable surprise of LA. I cannot believe that the findings that have come out of these tar pits in the middle of a massive city have made major contributions to what scientist now know about the last ice age. This small museum wasn't crowded, but it's volunteers were available with specimens which they knew a great deal about, and the displays were phenomenal. They have millions of skeletons catalogued since discovery early last century and 80% of an intact mammoth skeleton. We were fortunate enough to see volunteers excavating one of the 23 boxes of asphelt and It is a travesty that this valuable research doesn't recieve enough funding.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SickofBadService2014
40,Interesting place!,"Dropped in on the Page Museum / La Brea tar pits while visiting LA with the kids. This is a cool place with an interesting museum that held the attention of my two teen kids-no small feat. Unreal how many fossils have been discovered in the digs here and the work is still ongoing. The gas bubbling up in the water & tar pit at the entry was pretty cool and set the primeval mood-the rest of the small tar pits scattered about were unremarkable-usually almost covered with leaves and dust- but this ""camo"" is probably why they were so dangerous to passing beasts. the museum grounds are a popular park that was fun to just hang out in while checking out the various exhibits. Really liked how many of LA's attractions-Hollywood Blvd, La Brea, Griffith Observatory, Santa Monica Pier , Venice Beach, etc. are all pretty close together in North LA not far from LAX. Made it easy to see ""the sights"" in just a day or two. This one was worth the stop for anyone history/science minded at all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/txyz
40,Still fascinating after all these years,"It is hard to wrap my mind around some of the statistics that we saw. Over 3.5 million animals have been recovered so far, and there are still many more to find. All of these were trapped in a skim of tar that was too sticky to get out of. Just the number of Dire Wolves is enough to boggle the mind. All of this is located right in town and is easily accessible via auto or public transportation. We were especially impressed with the number of volunteers there ready and able to explain many of the exhibits. The boys (10 and 12) were as fascinated as the adults, and it ended up being a very good stop for all of us.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/smjustus
30,a bit disappointed,"My family and I went to the Tar Pits to see them before driving to Anaheim for a baseball game. The tar pits themselves were like small pounds surrounded by chain link fence. I expected a larger body, with overlooks and watching archeological digs, so I was a bit disappointed, although the museum was informative. There is a fee for the museum, but the park, tar pits, restrooms and other areas are free of charge.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/360janam
50,Highly recommended!,"The tar pits are well worth a look – especially because they’re pretty easy to get to.The tar pits are famous for having provided massive amounts of ancient animal bones and the on-site museum does a great job at showing the scale and range of what’s been discovered, even if its animal exhibits aren’t the newest and the big roaring mammoth isn’t quite up to Disney’s scale. The tar pits themselves are scattered around the attached park and provide a nice walk in the sunshine, although remember that tar does smell quite a bit.The location is pretty central and actually easy to get to from the 217 bus meaning it was a cheap day out from our Hollywood hotel. Recommended!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jalu
40,Nice place to spend the day with family,Nice historical place in the middle of busy Los Angeles. Cool excavation sites dating back thousands of years. Nice museum with lots of exhibits. Good place to take children.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JimmyJackk
50,"Do people really want to see ""tar pits""?","As a kid, I'd hear the ""tar pits"" mentioned on TV shows and wondered what was there. Though my family vacationed to SoCal often (from NorCal), we never stopped to check out what all the fuss was about. I grew up figuring it was a tourist trap of some sort. I mean, does anyone really want to see tar pits?So, I finally checked them out (while also visiting the Petersen). The tar pit itself is not worth the stop. It's a pond, of sorts, with oil seeping up into it.What's worth seeing is the Page Museum. From these tar pits, thousands of bones have been recovered showing the fauna of SoCal thousands of years ago. Note, this is not about dinosaurs, it's much more recent than that.There are bones of mammoths, dire wolves, giant sloth, and the famous saber-toothed cat (not a tiger!). Now the museum, which is still working to recover specimens from sediment, probably more than two centuries' worth of work to go, is even starting to look at microscopic organisms. It's all enlightening, especially if you want to imagine what California was like before humans.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tennisbump
50,Really cool place!,Right smack in the middle of LA and it is really cool. The kids loved it. Highly recommend if you are in the area. Your kids will really enjoy it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sportsmom8078
50,Such an Interesting Place,It's hard to believe this place is right in the middle of LA. It's fascinating and a must see for all visitors.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeanneK65
40,Interesting Museum,Very interesting place but the museum is smaller than I though. My kids (4 & 6) went through this very fast and were not that interested in it. Better suited for older kids. We didn't stay that long here. For the cost of parking and admission I'll skip this if I'm ever In the area again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/belindam
30,We enjoyed the pits more than the museum.,"The museum is nice for looking at fossils, and the staff and volunteers are very friendly and helpful, but we would enjoyed this area just as much by spending all of our time looking at the bubbling tarpits than in the museum. The museum does not go into why the tar is there, or why it bubbles, it focuses on the animal remains found in the pits, not that that is not interesting- we were just hoping for more info about the actual tar. We did not pay the extra $3 per person to watch the movie, so maybe they covered it in there, I don't know. I would recommend looking at the museum website at what they offer before deciding to pay the money to visit. And, if you're limited on time, you might do just as well by taking advantage of the beautiful walkways around the pits while you read about them on your phone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FourBeavers
50,Only place in the world!,"Living only a mile away and having volunteered in the 1990s in both the lab and doing excavations in Pit 91 I feel completely confident stating that this is the ONLY place in the world that is able to give you this experience. Where else are you afforded the opportunity to view bones and fossils that are more than 14,000 years old being excavated while you watch?Unfortunately the public is not allowed in the storage area that houses over a million different specimens. It gives meaning to the word ""awesome"".Fossils are still being uncovered when streets in the surrounding area are being dug up for repair. Imagine digging to lay new sewer pipes and coming up with a mastodon femur. How about a dire wolf jaw. This does actually still occur.In response to the gentleman who said that he expected way more, this is not an amusement park. It is a national treasure and not meant to be tricked out with hype and glitz.There is a fee to enter the Page Museum but the Tar Pits and surrounding park are free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carolelynns
40,Very interesting,"My husband and I really enjoyed this. It was neat seeing the Pits on the park grounds. The museum was interesting. Went entering the museum they take your picture in front of a greenboard. You have the option to purchase it when leaving. Inside the museum there were movies about excavating and there are many displays of bones and other fossils. I wish my kids were younger this would of been something to bring them to see at least once. The park around the museum is nice and great to stroll around.Across the street from the pits are many vendors that sell food and drinks.We ended up buying that souvenir picture, it was really neat how they displayed dinosaurs behind us in the background. It was $20.00 and it helps fund the museum. Also we parked in a lot across the street and that cost us $10.00. I could find no parking on the street.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dianimal9761
40,Amazing,"OK. You are in the middle of LA. On the outskirts you've seen some nodding donkeys oil facilities, and the tour guide has said you are riding around on top of an oil field.You look out of the window and a dark looking lake goes 'gloop'. Nope its not a lake, its a tar pit, and its live!.They have tried to develop it by providing a viewing platform and there is a family of elephants (not real you understand), with mama sinking into the tar pit. Whilst the museum maybe is a bit dated, I found it fascinating. There are displays and pictures which explain the animals that have been identified here. The tarpits allegedly are ancient and ice ages put a layer of water on top, so animals came to drink and sunk into the tar. The area was owned by a family and there are photos of the whole ranch as it was in the early 1900s, and further photos showing its development to this area of LA today. A Unique feature is the 'fishbowl' within the museum,which houses the labs where they are recovering and identifying fossils. You can see scientists at work, and there are notes on a board saying what they are working on.Its a really worthwhile exhibition. Just take care outside if you've got kids- there is a bit of the tarpit that has escaped and a little pool of tar is just ripe for them to ruin shoes",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/850margaretf
30,Dated museum but still interesting,We wanted to see the tar pits due to their historical significance. It's quite a unique site. But I was personally disappointed overall. The outside tar pits are quite small and frankly not that interesting beyond the fact there there is outside space in LA with nothing on it. The museum was really quite old and dated. It looks like a lot of national park museums that were setup in the 70s. For LA I expected way more.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rhaleuk

40,Good day outing with little ones,"We drove from out of town to visit the La Brea Tar Pits and the museum. Truth be told, our kids were mesmerized by the pits outside and would have stayed there all day had we let them! We finally made it inside and walked around the museum. There are some very interesting exhibits, and the kids enjoyed watching the scientists working in the glass-surrounded room. There is also a short video which gave us a nice little break mid-visit. The kids had a great time as did the adults. There was enough visual entertainment to keep even the little ones interested, and it was interesting enough to keep the adults captivated as well. This is not my favorite museum in Los Angeles (we prefer the Natural History Museum) but as far as the Tar Pits go, this is a must see!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OliveOyl2001

50,A trip back in time.,"For years I had heard about this place and I finally got to visit it. Outside you can see the actual tar/asphalt bubble up in the larger open pit or lake. This is an active research site with prehistoric finds and recovery on going.Inside the museum the displays show many of the bones found on the property and you can view an area where the finds are being cleaned, cataloged and possibly prepared for display.There is a fee which supports the on-going research and supports the museum. Military is free.A visit will last between 2-3 hours and will definitely enlighten you to some history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DennisA1153
30,Tie it in with a trip to LACMA,"Really the museum isn't that great. However I remember really liking it as a kid (over 30 years ago). It hasn't changed all that much, which is refreshing. It's kind of expensive for what it is, but free if you have a Natural History Museum membership. Also you can tie it in with a trip to LACM, which is free for kids and for any adult accompanying a child (<18 years). Make sure to save some time to allow your kids to roll down the grass hill that is the side of the Page Museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/markwT471OW

50,A worthwhile experience,"I was a little surprised by the ticket price and the size of the museum, but after watching the two films, I learned that it's an ongoing ice age fossil dig and that the money supports the research. Once I knew that, I looked at the experience in a whole new light and was amazed by the number of fossils on display (they have several million total, most are stored on site). And seeing the active dig site was pretty cool.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bmwoerner
30,"Unique and interesting, but some exhibits only open at certain times","We visited the area by public transport which seems a good idea when reading other peoples reviews about parking. The outside area was well kept, interesting to see the tar pits. Not all of the pit areas were open which was a little disappointing, but I understand that the limited funding means not all the pits can be open all the time. The grounds we well kept.Despite not being able to see into some of the pit excavation viewing areas, it was still great to see the bubbling pits. Also cool to see the tar coming out of the ground.The museum was interesting, and easy to navigate as it is not so big.What did concern me was some of the things to buy in the gift shop. Should they really be selling lolly pops / jewellery with scorpions and other creatures inside? I did see necklaces with sharks teeth on them, not sure if they were real or replica, and if they are real, what are the origins of them? To me, this seems distateful. Just my opinion.Overall an interesting and unique way to spend a couple of hours, and to see a window into the past and what LA used to be like 40,000 years ago.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/51emmad
50,Prehistoric wildlife in middle of the city,"We have been to LA several times and most likely have driven past this museum, but didn't take notice. We finally stopped and enjoyed the inside and outside of Page. We spent about 2-3 hours. If you have the chance take the guided tour outside. Our guide was enjoyable and entertaining. Inside the exhibits are attractively arranged. There is a glass enclosed workroom so you can observe volunteers searching for remains of prehistoric creatures in the solidified tar.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carol765
40,Time to kill before catching a plane at LAX? Tar pits and BTO's!,"If you have some time to kill before catching your plane at LAX, I would recommend walking around this area. We had less than an hour and instead of sitting at the airport we walked around the museums. The tar pits were interesting. The sculpture gardens outside the LAMCA were interesting. They offered us photo opportunities and exercise. The coffee shop upstairs between the buildings at LAMCA had great coffee and yummy sweet and savory treats for reasonable prices. I have to get the recipe for the BTO, better than Oreo, cookie!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gmanbumpy
40,Small but cool!,"The Page museum is fun for history buffs, science geeks, and geology/zoology students. Unknown to most people who visit LA, the city has its own active tar pit from the Ice Age right on Wilshire Blvd in the museum row on the Miracle Mile. The museums has found an impressive collection of plants and animals over the past several decades, with everything on display in the museum. Visitors also get a glimpse of scientists working on new finds in the museum's glass walled lab. Most of the animals on display are extinct and from the last ice age. The best part of the museum is that you can see active tar pits!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JJCrawford
50,Inspiring for various ages,"From a toddler to grade school children and the adults, we had a fantastic and educational visit to this museum. We went on the tour (free with admission) and that wasn't geared for a toddler but exploring the museum was great!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/740sr
50,Very interesting,"The La Brea Tar Pits are well worth a visit, even if just to see the tar oozing up into the waters of the pool. You can wander round, there is no charge unless you go into the museum, we were too late in the day to go round the museum, maybe next time! The smell is not too bad, bit like Tarmac being spread on the roads. The scene depicting the elephants tho is sad, the father and baby standing on the edge of the pool not able to help as the mother elephant is being sucked into the water. There are other dinosaur models there around the lake.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tugflorida
40,Another hidden gem.,Finally after a few visits to LA I was able to get to the Tar Pits and the Page Museum. What made new visit even greater was that I could take my two children. My son who is 6 and fascinated with dinosaurs was amazed from the very beginning. As you walk around you can visit live dig sites and were able to see the remains of a Saber toothed tiger.The Tar Pits in themselves are great to see as they bubble away and emit a unique smell.As you make you way around please take the time to visit the George C Page Museum. It's a small fee I think around $12 but the exhibits they have are amazing. The real exhibit of a Woolley mammoth must be seen.It's amazing to see how many exhibits and hones have been recovered from this area.As I said my children loved it and so did my wife and I.Then as you finish take the time to walk around the grounds and enjoy the sun and the suspended rock exhibit from the adjoining Contemp Art Museum. As you walk around you will forget you are in LA and enjoy what is on offer.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mattmboom
40,Seemed to be missing something.,"This place is great, don't get me wrong...I love living history...stuff that is literally happening in the now fascinated myself, and my family. Just seemed like it was not enough. I can put my finger on why I feel this way. Everything was top notch...just quick. Only an hour and everything was to be seen. I would go back, just might plan differently.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/22MichaelA22
50,Tar Pits,Definitely an interesting change from all the Hollywood glitter! We were fascinated by this piece of pre history in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ErinS257
40,Dinosaur Delights !,"After many visits to LA I finally got to La Brea Tar Pits. It's a fascinating site which you can wander through Hancock Park for free and see plenty of interesting things or put your hand in your pocket and do the George C Page Museum as well ($11/head). It is a pretty good museum with great exhibits , good intro film and interesting viewing. As luck would have it we shared with a hundred plus schoolkids doing assignments as they ran from exhibit to exhibit , noisy but great to see the excitement in their eyes !! The bubbling pits in the park (smelly) add to the whole experience and are better then fun parks I think ??",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Skeney57
50,Small unique museum,"If you are spending your morning in Beverly Hills, the Page Museum is a great place to spend your afternoon. The tar pits are active, bubbling with methane gas outside of the museum. Inside, you can see paleontologist digging through real fossils. The fossil collection found right ion the heart of LA is astounding. You see the whole museum in a hour. A must see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeighG708
40,LA essential,"So I wasn't quite sure what was at the tar pits (except a pond of tar) but I was pleasantly surprised at the education I received during my visit. It's not a day or even half day event by any means but it's amazing at what they site does encompass. The grounds are well preserved and they have active excavations that you can see being performed. Parking is $10 but you can leave your car there and walk to the close proximity museums for the whole day. The ""tar pits"" aka liquid asphalt that are no deeper than a few feet STINK but make you think about what LA used to look like. It's a must if you've never seen the site before.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Candace241
40,Cool spot for a short visit,We spent a couple of hours here looking at the displays and all the fossils. A very nice collection and informative displays. We took a short guided tour of the grounds and got a lot of good information. Nice grounds and a good gift shop. You can see the whole thing in a few hours.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravlinNacho
40,Grounds are beautiful!,"We visited LA for a trip here and a play at Pantages. Wish we had known about the food trucks in front of the Art Museum right next door! We wouldn't have eaten right before heading in.The grounds are well maintained and include interesting signage with information regarding the excavations that have and are going on here, right in the middle of LA. Lots of kids running around, lots of people having lunch or walking through the area. Was really nice.The museum is interesting, if a little quick to get through for $12. I would not want to be here when school tours were taking place!The ""Fishbowl"" where you can watch staff and volunteers work was memorizing! I could have stood there for hours. And the garden area inside the museum was absolutely beautiful! Great place to sit and relax.Use the bathroom inside the museum, not the grounds!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tovin
40,Death Comes to the Saber Tooth Cats and Mammoths,"We have seen films and TV shows of La Brea, but the in person experience is well worth the trip. This attraction directly fronts on Wilshire Blvd. Cars whiz by the mammoths stuck in the tar. There are at least a dozen little fenced areas where tar just oozes out of the ground. More amazing are the excavation sites (pits) which show the thousands of animals that lived in the area 25,000 years ago.The Page Museum puts all the history and archeology together with many exhibits of skeletons and recreations of the animals that lived in the area. You would not want to be around then as the saber tooth cats had really big mouths.A good place to take kids interested in archeology and history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/650GeorgeP650
50,So interesting,we stopped here on our last day! took us about an hour to go through the whole museum. You could see the fossils being worked on and it had so many fossils in amazing condition. We headed over to LACMA for lunch so that was also nice!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mirandah626
40,Must-see family travel site for the science-interested,"First of all, if you are not interested in either science generally or in fossils or paleontology more specifically, feel free to skip this site. But if you or family members are fascinated, say, by all things ancient or even by dinosaurs, though there are NO dinos at this site, it is a must-see. The Page Museum offers a rare chance to see ancient fossils including saber tooth tigers, wooly mammoths, dire wolves, and many other now extinct creatures. The museum itself will seem small, when you step inside, but your family is likely to spend a couple of hours walking through well laid-out exhibits. And, of course, you can also walk through the adjacent park to view the still-present tar pits (hard to photograph but priceless to view). We've visited this museum twice, once with elementary school aged kids and once with teens. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves both times. If you drive - always ""fun"" in Los Angeles - it's much better to visit on a week-day, as the parking lot is more likely to have spaces and NO ONE wants to drive in circles in L.A. looking for parking! Also, when we came on a week day the entire visit was relaxing but .. a long time ago .. when we came on a weekend, viewing the exhibits (not to mention finding parking) was more challenging.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AG1593
30,"Interesting, but I wouldn't say it's a ""must see""","Although you can walk around the Tar Pits and not pay to go into the Museum I recommend that you do as the museum provides a lot of information not included on the signs outside. I found it interesting but was disappointed that we were unable to watch the actual digging. My husband enjoyed it more than I did, so he may have rated it higher. I think it would be a great place to take kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/opieks
50,Great Place,In the City is a great museum. The whole family loved it and we really want to go back. An amazing find with active archaeology taking place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Scottwalt529
50,Best attraction in L.A.,"I've gone three times now, once as a newcomer, two times to show family/friends visiting. Everyone loves the Tar Pits. Good location (next to LACMA), nice park, good for all ages. The hands on components (how strong you have to be to pull out of tar) are very fun. It's great to see not just the tar pit side but the general development of the area. Also, of any museum I've gone to, the store reigns supreme.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JessicaL200
30,A little overpriced,Mildly interesting. Displays are done well. One large tar pit and several small tar pits around the property. A little over priced in our opinion.The woman working the reception admissions was very unfriendly and did not offer any information.We will not return or recommend this attraction.No place to eat on premises.daisyCalifornia,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/daisyCalifornia
50,A great place to visit with kids while in LA,"Vey interesting and the kids loved it. Displays ice age fossils that have fallen into tar pits and have been recovered by paleontologists. Plenty of skeletons, models, kids can watch palaeontologists at work. Fans of the Ice Age movies can see the 'real' cast of characters. It only takes 1-2 hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Anita2574
40,Lots of kids!,"Interesting exhibits, smelly tar pits that are still producing fossils. Small museum very popular with school field trips. Museum store was disappointing -- mostly toys and souvenirs that appeal to children. Not very many books for adults who are truly interested in fossils.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cmj-g
40,Nice exhibits,This was the 1st thing we did in LA and still the best after a week vacation. Small museum and expensive to park but wonderful displays of ice age animals. Try to go when the field trips at not there it gets crazy. The food trucks across the street are great for lunch,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dumptrumpco
50,Cool museum in the heart of downtown,"Fun very interesting museum of the tar pits! Lots of amazing animal artifacts, husband and I really enjoyed, the teen in our group thought it was interesting but of course she found the glitz of hollywood much more fun",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/llb876
40,Caps Off the Experience,Started with the guided tour of the tar pits and lake. The museum capped off the experience. Enjoyed the fish bowl where the new finds were displayed and workers were cleaning off new fossils. Very well laid out and does not take long to go through. The price is not bad and really adds to the viewing of the tar pits and excavation sites.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/389billk
50,"Really great exhibits, tar pits less spectacular than expected","The museum is very well executed and the displays are informative, creative, and attractive. Some cute toys in the gift shop, too. The Tar Pits themselves were kind of lackluster compared to what I was expecting-- viscous, bubbling dark pits. Instead, it was a fenced off pond with some methane bubbles and some slick looking areas. Definitely worth a visit but manage your expectations. The grounds are well kept and the active dig sites were interesting to look at. Those were more what I was expecting to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ldeimos
50,Hidden gem - must go.,"If you have seen volcano movie, this is the place where the initial eruption happens. It still active. It is well preserved. It is gives a lot information about history. It is quite a learning. Has some many artifacts from past.Watch movie inside before your start hour tour. This will help you to appreciate the artifacts.Parking is expensive in entire Los Angeles. But this is unique place in whole world worth paying it.For food do try the Farmers market. Also must see place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TadA232
40,Good Preservation,I liked the way the historical facts were presented and that the site is an ongoing dig for fossils. It was most enlightening.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sliphorn
30,La Brea Tar Pits,We liked being able to see so much before having to pay to get into the museum. The museum itself is really small. The best part is outside where all of the tar pits and excavation sites are...and that is free.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LindaLoweinAZ
40,Nice place to visit for free,"My family and I were on a day trip to Los Angeles, and a friend recommended this place to me. We didn't go in the museum because we were on a strict budget, but there is a lot of things to do and/or look at for free.My kids enjoyed the statues of the various animals around the park area, and the tar pits themselves. I enjoyed this and you can't beat the price of the park... free except for the $7.00 parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scottwA3471AG
40,"Learn about the Tar Pits and see them, too!","The museum is OK. Inside the museum, you can watch live archaeologists work with fossils, which is interesting. There are two instructional videos about the La Brea Tar Pits. The rest of the interior of the museum feels geared toward kids (we spent less than an hour inside the museum). I enjoyed seeing the actual tar pits located outside of the museum (this is free, you don't need to pay for the museum to see the pits). You can also go to Pit 91, which is an old tar pit where they continue to find fossils from 40,000+ years ago. The museum is surrounded by a nice park that you can walk around, too. There are also food trucks located near the museum, which offer lots of different lunch options.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EmmyMPLS
50,Very Cool,"Very cool place. Kids had fun and the wife and I enjoyed learning about the history. Amazing that they actively are still working on digs that you can see. Not much was fake, at least not that I could tell. Ice Age video was cool, but I don't know that it was worth $3.50. I wish we lived closer because we all would volunteer. Aside from the information and knowledge attained, it was just pretty cool to look at all the bones and people working on the sites.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/atcguru33
40,Lots to learn here,"Beautifully presented museum, with good information about the animals. Those sabre-tooth cats were nasty beasts! Doesn't't take long to go round and there are some working pits to see outside. A tip- the Petersen car museum is just a walk down the road and you can get a cup of tea there a lot cheaper than the $6 charge at LACMA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rutlandlass
40,Pretty Cool,"We went on a Thursday around 10 am, which appears to be a pretty good day/time to go as it wasn't that crowded. We did have to wait about 5 minutes to get parking in their lot. I'm not sure if they have other places to park but make sure you don't accidentally park in the lot across of the PAGE Museum, they charge an arm and a leg!! The actual museum was pretty interesting. It wasn't overly stimulating or too jam packed with information. The lake pit was the coolest part. I like how they staged animals around it and you could actually see the tar bubbling!! The walk around the park is paved and pretty easy to follow. We checked out some of the other tar pits but none of them were as interesting as the lake pit. They don't have a self-guided tour or anything so If you want to learn more about the tar pits I would go on the tour (1pm and 3pm during the week).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iLive4Adventuring
40,After reading about this for years.....,"...I finally visited it! My husband and I were in LA, dropping our daugher off at LAX. We decided to head to the LaBrea Tar Pits - my hubs is a CA native and had never been. Be prepared for a LOT of children - we were there on a Friday around 11am. Made it difficult to read some of the exhibits with them bumping and darting around - but not everyone is irritated by that, haha. Worth the visit, I very much enjoyed the surrounding park and bubbling tar ponds. Smells like a road being paved! If you park in the lot behind the museum, take the parking ticket inside and they deduct $2 from your entrance fee. Doesn't take a whole lot of time to go through the museum, and we read most of the available information.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/745adriap
50,Picking a bone,"Had a great time in this place. A must see for everyone not only for the adults but the little ones around us are enjoying themselves . Interesting to know all the bones inside this museum were excavated just around it, from all these ""tar pits"" . The tour is a must for everyone to better understand why the active pits are enclosed . Well, you don't want to be one of these fossils in the future or your pet Pomeranian dog. They have over 4000 dire wolves fossils already in exhibit . A surprisingly nice garden within this museum offers a nice reprieve after a warm walk to see all the excavation sites.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pjtravels3
50,Interesting,"You don't need to pay to visit the site, just the museum. It was very interesting and smelly! You even get to see the curators cleaning the bones in their gold fish bowl!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/246Lizzie
40,"Museum excellent, outside Cool to see bubbling but many tar pits closed",The museum was very interesting with great exhibits but we would have liked to have gone in to see some of the tar pits and not just the little lake area outside that was bubbling. It was still fun to read about but i think i was expecting more.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CMF568
40,Very interesting,The tar pits themselves are a bit underwhelming but the museum is interesting. Personally I really enjoyed learning a bit more about the giant ice age mammals that lived in this area for tens of thousands of years. Saber Tooth Cats of course but you just don't hear about critters like the Giant Sloth very often let alone see skeletons or recreations. The history of the property itself was interesting. However I felt a bit bad for the scientists who literally had to work behind a glass wall while being gawked at by the crowds. I would hate to work that way myself.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/897todds
40,Worthwhile visit,"I enjoyed the visit here, well worth taking the time to walk through the museum.Especially interesting was the old photographs showing the more recent development of the area.I was also fascinated by the museums founders history George Page.We also paid extra for the auditorium saber tooth cat experience which was neat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rodg856
50,So interesting,"I visited the La Brea Tar Pits as part of the Hop on Hop off tour in LA. It was so interesting to walk around the park and see the tar pits. I didn't go into the museum as I ran out of time, but I definitely recommend a stop here when in LA. There is information and signs around the park to read about the tar pits and their ongoing work there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cookiesncream27
40,Amazing Animal Artifacts,"Total surprise. I'd heard about La Brea Tar Pits decades ago and wanted to see what the commotion was about. This visit to L.A. we finally made time.My visual had always been oozing, bubbling, scalding ponds of thick gooey tar, situated on unsettled terrain miles out in the desert, where the ground was unfit for building. Reality is nothing like that.The tar pits and museum are located on maybe two acres, smack in the middle of dense LA construction and population. Several wrought iron fence squares, maybe 2 feet by 2 feet, keep visitors from stepping into unexplored tar spots. Some ooze and bubble a bit. There is no steam, so I don't know how hot they might be.Two large, partially excavated pits are fenced off because you don't want to get your foot stuck in there. Digging started a hundred years ago, in 1914 at both sites, and thirty (30) mammoths were discovered in the first year in just one pit.The very large Lake Pit on the grounds is filled with water, and oil bubbles to the surface in several areas. This is where the museum situated a display of an elephant getting stuck, to eventually be swallowed whole by the tar.Page Museum has incredible specimens of in tact whole animal skeletons (including a juvenile mastadon) - because they were so well preserved in tar before the archaeological digs. Who knew that mastadons lived in LA ?The tar pits reminded me of the Beverly Hillbillies TV show ... ""up from the ground came the bubbling crude."" It looks more like oil than tar but, maybe when exposed to air, it thickens.The museum is fascinating. Skeleton after skeleton is on display, with historical facts related to each find. And you can watch museum employees and volunteers doing current research through the viewing windows of the Fishbowl Lab.Admission to the grounds is free. If you want to tour the museum, it's well worth the $12 (and only $9 for seniors).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FancyFree55
50,Very cool,It was a lovely park with a very small museum. What we found inside kept my three boys attention glued. The readers read and the non readers had plenty to see. Us old folk even found it interesting seemed to paint a historic picture. Nice place to picnic but beware tar holes kids can easily poke sticks in and get messy so come prepared for that.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hope_carter
50,Tar Pits,I had read about this place in NG magazine and had wanted to stop here. The walk outside is short and very interesting. There are even two spots where the hot spring with its tar has burst through to the surface recently. Museum was good with a number of exhibits. Very important to note is that there is $10 parking directly behind the museum so do not go to one of the 'public' parking garages or you will most likely pay double or triple that price for your visit. Kids should like this.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SteveT
50,"Love history, Go here.","I love history, and the La Brea Tar Pits and Page museum did not let me down. Very cool and you'll learn a lot. The gift shop is cool but a little pricy, other than that its a very good place to go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bsanderson81
40,Loved this place,"The museum was closed, but for free we browsed the grounds. How cool to see bubbling tar scattered throughout the area with facilities for the ongoing archaeological work going on. We were visiting a relative who hadn't even been there!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Barnetjb123
30,Dinosaurs!!!,The park was free and you could still see the bubbling tar pits but to see the actual bones that were removed and cleaned/repaired you had to pay. Worth the time and money.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chemrn9905
40,Nice!,Lots of great art by famous artists such as Picasso and Andy Warhol. Very pretty setting and grounds.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/whc200
50,Page Museum/Tar Pits a hit with kids & adults,"We have been to the Page Museum/Tar Pits twice with our kids, once on a family trip and once, last year, as part of a school group. Both times the museum and associated La Brea Tar Pits were a huge treat. The wall of Dire Wolf skulls pulled from the pits is fascinating, and the active excavations, together with the indoor area where the scientists work behind glass, are neat ways for kids to see real-life scientists in action. The kids also enjoy rolling down the hills to get out excess energy. One warning: if your kids manage to get the tar on them, it does not come off easily and stains clothes and shoes (kids on our school trip learned this the hard way). The front desk in the Page has wipes to help remove the tar, but they do not work very well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GigiLJ
40,Very interesting,"It is good to find place to take our two grandkids that holds their interest, yet is not electronic. They loved the displays and to be able to see an actual dig going on. This is quite a feat considering they were thirteen and eleven years old.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/goldenrulelady
20,Not worth the money,"I've visited the tar pits numerous times, but had never been in the museum itself until recently. As it turns out, the most interesting thing about the tar pits is the part you can see for free by walking outside the museum. The museum is quite small (I was able to see everything in less than 30 mins.) and doesn't appear to have been updated since the 1970s. There are some fossils that have been brought up from the tar that are on display, but the information at the exhibits is quite brief. There is a corny green screen photo taken of you at the beginning, which you can purchase for $30. All of this seemed a little outrageous, and the museum should be using this money on updating its exhibits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/airforcebri
50,Saber Tooth Tigers and Woolly Mammoths,Fossils and more! What a delightful way to spend an afternoon. Take the kids and see the wonderful exhibits. Loved watching scientists examining specimens recently excavated. This is a must see if you are in Los Angeles. (And visit the Los Angeles County Museum of Art right next door).,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DennisB225
50,Worth the visit,"We loved going here. Really cool to see a museum where all of the fossils are collected from the surrounding areas. They are still actively excavating and you can go into the park and see where they are doing their work. The museum is a perfect size. You learn a lot, but don't have to spend the whole day. 1 to 2 hours is great. They have a quick film about the tar pits, and its fossils, which is worth seeing.I also liked learning about the history of the museum. The modern history of the tar pits and museum goes hand in hand with the history of L.A. Very informative.The museum is right next door to the LACMA and there are food trucks right across the street. Makes for a fun day in L.A.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/texan00
40,A Museum still active in preserving specimens,I was impressed that the museum is still working on getting specimens from the active bubbling tar pits located around the museum. Was even more impressed by the cute elderly volunteers at the museum who introduced the background of certain species with much enthusiasm to the children visitors. Thumbs up for their efforts!The biggest exhibit is a woolly mammoth found in 2010. No dinosaurs but still an nice good museum that is still actively working on uncovering and preserving specimens.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P_Koe
50,Nice Museum,"Tucked away in central LA, this place should not be missed if you like fossils. One of the largest collections of ice age fossil in the world. Woolly mammoths, saber tooth cats, giant sloths, birds and wolfs. We took the 30 minute tour of the grounds and found it very informative and interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TexasTeaTexas
50,no dinosaurs,"Before you bring your dino-crazy kids, be advised that the fossils here are from the Pleistocene Era- saber tooth cats, mammoths and the like. And boy howdy do they have specimens from that time! Hard to picture it now, but the whole area was once a giant tar bog. There are still some working digs next to the museum which give great insight into what it takes to get these bones out of the ground. These are not 'stone fossils' but rather bones that were preserved in the tar. The exhibits are amazing and the best specimens of their kind. There is a very nice atrium/green house in the center of the building. You can watch the staff cleaning up the specimens. Recommended for children with an interest in the subject- other 'too-cool' kids are going to be bored. There is also a bit of an asphalt smell if you are odor sensitive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/got-the-pin
40,Excellent for dinosaur lovers,"it was a good experience for my kids, who love dinosaurs and think they know everything about them. I would have liked to see more guided activities or a kids worksheet. The video is good and simple. The exhibition is perfect. The grounds are really nice, and it is fun to find tar holes around the premises.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/950marm
50,Best Museum I've ever been too.,"The most amazing place I've been. So interesting, real bones on display from ice age animals actually found in the pits on site. I stayed for both guided tours, which is included in the price of entry, $12 entry for an Adult ticket. The pits are interesting and I walked away excited like a kid.A MUST SEE!!Mind blowing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mshelzy007
50,Great Way to Spend a Few Hours,"The Page Museum is an old-school style museum, but all the better for it. Instead of focusing on slick new exhibits, the museum is chock full of remains dug up from the pits. There is a good mix of things you can look at, and things for kids to touch and play with. The short show was well worth the extra $3, but may be too scary for very young (under 5) kids.Make sure to leave some time to walk around the grounds, to see the pit and the new excavations onsite. A great time for the whole family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BCNY100
50,Genuinely Worth a Visit,This was a welcome relief to find a site of interest for all ages - well presented and very informative. It is worth doing the short tour which explains what the tar pits are all about. If after doing Disney and Universal your time in La La Land is limited I would recommend the Tar Pits ahead of the tackiness of Venice Beach and Santa Monica Pier. The Pits are not far from Hollywood Boulevard so for a rounded day of tackiness and culture thr Stars and the Pits is the way to go.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BazMelb
50,A must-see,"I was tired and footsore after a long day sightseeing and still needed to be fresh for a family dinner. Faint odor of tar behind a strong fence and glimpses of a pond drew us on in curiosity. Tar slicks. . . and off in the distance was a lifelike sculpture of a mammoth family. Put two and two together -- La Brea Tar Pits! and a whole museum about it! Spirits lifted, and we must've spent another hour or so there. Plenty to see, the exhibits are very well considered and put together, and there are even live humans on display (behind glass, working on the finds). We missed out on several more rooms and buildings because we got there late, so the next time we're in L.A. Page Museum will be tops on our list.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/317Mijd
50,Must see on any LA visit,"We took our three kids - 11, 10, and 8 - to the tar pits and loved it. Hugely informative and fascinating destination. I think we were there for about four hours. The kids loved it. Must see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SteaknKidney
50,The Page Museum and Tar Pits are a must see!,You would never believe that they're natural tar pits in the middle of Los Angeles! Such a beautiful place for any age and the museum is alot of fun. My wife and I just re-visited the museum with friends here from Florida and they were amazed and it was their favorite site in Los Angeles. The museum is very interesting with great exhibits that will keep anyone engaged. Kids love trying to see if they're stronger than the tar and enjoy watching the scientist work on projects. Plan to spend a half hour walking outside around the tar pits. Great place to spend 2-3 hours. Enjoy!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lumerian
40,Seventy+ years later,"When my father described his visit to California in the 1930's, the one place he always mentioned as being very interesting was the La Brea Tar Pits. Well, in the year 2013, I finally got there. Dad was right. Thanks to the museum and the on site work being done, the Tar Pits are very interesting. The museum has a number of specimens on display and a window into the current excavation work as well. The animals that roamed this area were huge! Who knew we had camels in America? Kids will love this place. We arrived later than we had hoped, but managed to see most of the place. Others have recommended the guided tour. Good advice to maximize your visit. A good balance to all the glitz otherwise associated with LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Year_of_Tiger
50,So Much More Than We Anticipated,"We all read about the tar pits in school, but this was totally amazing.We were in town for the Rose Bowl and rented a car a couple of days before the Game. We didn't plan on visiting the Museum. We stumbled upon it touring the City on our own.We figured we'd spend half an hour tops. We spent over an hour.We didn't have time in the day to see any of the movies available.The exhibits are extremely interesting. We didn't know anything about the ownership history of La Brea. That alone was amazing. It was a lesson in the development of California agriculture, oil, real estate development and History.The scope of the Tar Pit finds is illustrated by the wall of 460 Dire Wolf skulls which are a small percentage of the Dire Wolf skulls found to this point. The scope of the finds are amazing!It was fascinating watching two people sorting little specks under microscopes to find minute bones blackened by the tar with fine, camel hair brushes.Seeing the pits bubble with methane is also amazing. One can imagine animals becoming trapped. It's so interesting to read how some animals would wait until dark knowing the tar would stabilize in cooler temperatures and then venture after their prey.The Park is beautifully planned and well maintained. Many families and several tours were , but there's plenty of space for all.This is one of those sites that makes History books come alive more so than you'd ever imagine.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Stategt
50,Eye Opener,"we got there at 9:30 and stayed till 3:00PM - Saw everything. Indoor tour, outdoor tour and the ice age show. Spend the time to really understand what is really there and you will find that we are really a small part of earth. Interesting about the LA basin being under water. Very cool to know what walked on the same ground thousands of years ago. The cafe was good. Many people gripe about it but a mcdonalds will cost you 20.00 for two people and that is not healthy. Two people eat well for 30.00. The food was good and healthy. Maybe the burgers are nto the best, then do not get a burger! Great day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelmS8838EC
30,Wasn't as good as I thought it would be.,"I'm sure most kids would go crazy over the bones and tar pits. But the exhibit wasn't very well maintained or clean. Lots of saber tooth cats, dire wolves, and a few wholly mammoths. Very fascinating how they clean and catalog the bones. We spent an hour there and that was enough. Didn't make it to Pit 91 before it closed for the day so we didn't see an actual ""dig"" going on. I would recommend it for kids but don't spend the day there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scratchgolfer19
30,Kept me entertained for a couple hours.,"I visited the Page Museum on Christmas Eve 2013. The staff was super friendly and the two women that led a short tour were very informative and knowledgeable. I'll admit that I wasn't super fascinated with the exhibits (one can only look at so many fossils) but for those interested in history and animals I'd highly recommend it! I enjoyed the video at the end of the museum but the one near the entrance, while informative, was quite dated. Great neighborhood with nearby parking and restaurants and convenient access for an afternoon at LACMA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LindsayB35
40,Interesting place to go,The wooly mammoth is worth a visit. The artifacts are quite interesting. You can tour the museum easily in a matter on 1-2 hours. The tar pits? Who knew - right in the middle of Los Angeles!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sightsee802692
50,For the lover of ancient artifacts,This museum is good for all families who enjoy experiencing the creatures that roamed the earth before man. The open air lab that shows the work being done in real time is a treat. As is the reconstructed extinct animals that lived on earth prior to man.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robertaj740
50,Tar Pits???,"While on a day adventure in LA, I went to the La Brea Tar Pits with my boyfriend - although I've never heard of them or what tar pits even were. Once getting there we saw the water area and I literally stood there for about 15 minutes just staring at the water and completely fascinated by what was happening. There was a slight smell of methane (which is what the pits produce) but nothing to make you sick. We went around to all of the observation areas and there were some people actually doing work on specific sites while wandering around.Watch out while walking through the grass - there could be tar areas throughout the grass - most are contained with fences. You could even see all of the tar like substance in the small holes that it creates.I was completely satisfied and fascinated by this experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/katew83
40,"You've heard about the Tar Pits, now go see them.",This was one of those places we always said we should see but never took the time so this time we spent an extra day to visit and it was worth it. Nothing that will blow your mind just very interesting the whole story of the history of that area and how all the animals became trapped in the tar pits.Plan three hours.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lvtotrvl20
50,Tar very much !,"Until finding this treasure trove of an attraction, I associated Tar Pits as part of the Flintstones scene. But here it is, right smack in the middle of Los Angeles city, right on Wilshire Blv and off La Brea. It is one of the bestest museums in the world, a LIVING museum, still bubbling tar out of the ground where you walk, echoes of the music of the Piltdown Men and their hit, 'Bubbles in the Tar'. Inside there are excellent displays of the history of the museum, the skellingtons recovered, diaramas, dire wolf skulls to blow your mind, mammoth skulls, lion skulls, full size reconstructions of whatever you have only seen in books.I consider it one of the finest museums in the world, friendly staff who are only too willing to assist, help, describe things, and recommend even good places to eat. America at it's best !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/525peteb
40,see woolly mammoth!,"The museum contains many of the fossils that have been dug out of the tar pits, including a woolly mammoth. I'd recommend doing one of the tours that are included with the price of admission. You get an up close look at several of the tar pits including some that are not open to the public.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Andy_the_diver
50,"Fascinating, but watch that children don't get into ""tar""!","My first visit.Of course I'd heard about the tar pits many years ago, but I'd never seen them. Interestingly, neither had either of my companions who live in the Greater LA area.But we all enjoyed the grounds and the museum.Over 100 tons, yes TONS, of fossils have been dug from the tar pits. A small percentage but an impressive selection of them are on display in the museum.If you are a dinosaur fanatic you will be disappointed. The tar pits are ""only"" about 50,000 years old. But they have been a source of fossils for many quite impressive ice age mammals.Impressive? How about the ""Short Nose Bear"" which stood a foot taller than today's Grizzly? Or the American Lion which was larger and heavier than present day African Lions or Siberian Tigers. In fact the ancient jaguars were larger than today's lions!It is fascinating to watch the gas bubble up through the tar and make a splash like a large fish. But beware. There are oil seeps on the grounds. Staff tries to mark them with safety cones, but I imagine no small number of inquisitive children get into the tary stuff that might be found crossing the lawn. And I'll bet it doesn't wash out. 8-)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OldRoadWarrior60
40,Interesting tar pits,The tar pits are smaller than I expected. They are worth seeing if you are in the area. I would not go out of your way to get to the pits.The pits smell like tar. They bubble. They are fun to watch.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bebybiddybibo
40,Unique learning experience,"I visited the La Brea Tar Pits this past July with my family. I grew up in LA; however, it had been at least 10 years since I had visited this attraction. This was my family's first trip. The tar pits are a truly unique experience smack dab in the middle of downtown LA. The Page Museum perfectly presents the backdrop of the tar pits and explains their significance. I have to say, though, not much has changed in the past decade with regards to the museum. What is new and most exciting is the new excavation sites that have popped up around the area.Tip: Military discounts available.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/atlsuburbanite
50,Tar Pitts are pretty Awesome,"The Tar Pitts where an interesting sight for us from Australia who dont have them there, its amazing watching them bubble and the smell is quite overpowering. looking at what they found in there is also quite cool.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hotelier2407
50,Fascinating Look Back in Time,"The mammal skeletons in this museum are of pristine quality and are nicely displayed. The history of the tar pits is well presented. It's a bit sad, realizing that these animals became trapped in the tar and died an awful death, often being attacked by predators which in turn got trapped.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stans779
50,Educational and Entertaining for All Ages,"The Page Museum and the associated ""tar pits"", located in Hancock Park, are well worth seeing. The museum has many displays of both large (mammoths, saber-toothed tigers, ground sloths, etc.) and small animals (such as wolves and birds) that met their unfortunate demise in the pits. Information is well presented with many supporting pictures and diagrams in addition to the fossils. There is a lot to learn here and the museum provides free docent guided tours during the day. There are some nice ""hands-on"" displays for children. The tar pits themselves are located around the museum and are easily accessible. You can watch the paleontologists at work both in the lab in the museum and in the actual tar pits. This is also a peaceful respite from high pace of Los Angeles. Highly recommended for everyone with any interest in history, the ice age, fossils, etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chisos73
50,"Excellent, not to be missed","A unique museum in a unique place. Extremely interesting museum. It's not known to the big crowds but it's a shame nobody knows about this in the heart of the city. I love the place and take my friends there, every time I go to LA (which is a lot). And no one ever regretted going there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ezeluc
50,Tar Pits,"Really worth seeing, a very interesting museum and a much needed difference from the rest of L.A.. This is an amazing look back in time",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RoddersGlobetrotter
40,Worth a visit!,"The La Brea Tar Pits is situated within a lovely park where the family can walk around and see the several tar pits, some of which are still being excavated. The pits also have interesting signs that give you some history of when they discovered and what fossils were pulled from them. The museum is really interesting and worth visiting, the kids will especially enjoy the saber toothed cat and mastodon fossils. There are a couple of dated animatronic figures as well, and you can look inside the work lab where fossils are cleaned and catalogued. The whole visit will take about 60-90 minutes, depending on how interested you are. College students get a discount! Finally, it isn't the most handicapped friendly place to visit and museum is elevated and is a long stairstep walk up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/georgeandsheryl
50,A great look back in time,The Page Museum located in La Brea Tar Pits is a must see in LA. The museum house a number of discovered pre-historic Dino bones. It seems that the underlying asphalt deposits preserved many thousands of ancient bones. Many of these skeletons are found within the museum along with two interesting movies which explain the origins and implications of the tar pit discoveries. If you check ahead you may find the one day each month for free entry and discounted parking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scats36
30,See tar pits without going into museum,"Found out you don't need to purchase tickets at Page Museum to see the tar pits, which are free to the public. The museum had artifacts on display if you really must see them. There was no work going on when we were there but it was a nice stroll around the little lake.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/starrj
50,Fascinating Living Archaeology!,"This is the best thing we have visited in LA so far. The museum is fascinating with lots of fossils and bones on display. Sadly there was no one working in the fish bowl lab or dig sites when we visited, but there were information signs and 'work in progress' on display. A great place for big and little kids alike!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/606ClaireH
40,Nice Museum and only a hour needed,"Whilst I wouldn't put the Page Museum as a must see attraction in LA I will say its a very nice park and a very well run Museum.You could do everything in a hour (Museum, Park and a walk round the area) so I would plan it in with something else (the Farmers Market is only a 5 minute drive away) but Its definitely worth a visit. Also with everything being so expensive in LA it was a refreshing change to see parking and entry cost me less that $10.Overall Id recommend going to it if you have a hour free during the day",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EnglishDragon
50,Don't Come to LA Without Seeing the Tar Pits,"The La Brea Tar Pits is a ""must see"" in my opinion. Located on Wilshire, the park is surrounded by city buildings and activity. You can see the pits without paying to go into the museum. So, if you are short on cash, at least stop in to see the pits. The museum, however, is well worth a visit. Inside, you will see many of the skeletons and bones that were recovered from the pits, including hundreds of dire wolf skulls. You can also watch the paleontologists at work and you can get first-hand experience pulling things from the sticky tar. Be sure to walk beyond the museum and main pit in order to check out the smaller pits, the viewing deck and project 23.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/91shannonk
50,Do not miss this !!!,"This is something you do not want to miss on a trip to LA !! Not only was the museum interesting ( guides on hand to answer questions) the grounds are beautiful and inviting. Parking was ample and close and was self parking, this is great as I don't like a valet parking my car :) Johnny Rockets is within walking distance to Johnny Rockets for lunch !!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sherri1991
40,Great museum for all ages.,"We visited with our ten year old Son, seventy something Mom and my Husband. All of us were engaged and educated. We had passed it by for years then added it on a whim. Great little Museum and grounds. Loved seeing hands on science. Great to see it live as they excavated.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Plookey
40,"Really Neat Museum, Military Discount offered","The Page Museum its self is well done, although not very large. You get to see into a ""fishbowl"" where archeologists are cleaning and classifying fossils which is really cool. You should spend the extra bit for the Ice Age Encounter show. It lasts 15 mins, has a life size, realistic, puppet of a Saber Tooth Tiger, and a short video explaining how the Tar Pits are what they are and how so many fossils ended up there. You are also able to stroll by several active tar pits in the park and there are several small fenced off areas where the tar has randomly bubbled through in unexpected places....Mother Nature reminding us who is in still in charge. Oh, and the Military Discount made the entrance fee free for the whole party!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/958ryanh
30,Nice something else to do,"If you are near Hollywood, it's not far to go to the Tar Pits and see some authentic ""ice-age"" fossils and such. The park and area around it are also nice. And who knew...right there in the middle of town! Museum costs as does parking, but the park and little tour around it are free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/csharp59
50,Real surprise,Brilliant! Well worth a visit to see the excavation work and relics lifted from the tar. Good interpretive displays telling the history of the tar pits.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Orkneycat
50,A most unusual museum,Kids will love this museum and the surrounding tar pits and park.Bring a blanket and picnic on the lawn and let the kids explore the tar pits.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/psychjudy
50,Back In Time,The outside walks and visuals take you back to another time. Then the museum exhibits and explanations are a fantastic experience that i would recommend for all ages.The kids in my class were fascinated with the photos I took while I was there.Families would be wise to include the Tar Pits and Museum in their plans for LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lorraineChristchurch
50,The La Brea Tar Pits,"With half a day to fill in we took a limo to West LA and spent a couple of hours at the tar pits.Interesting in the extreme, inexpensive to visit and also close to many other attractions on similar ilk.As a travel agent I have never had this part of LA in my awareness.you can also walk to the Farmers Market from this locality.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ausman45
50,One of the World's Most Amazing Free Urban Attractions,"As a Los Angeles area resident, whenever visitors come into town, I recommend that they make a point to visit the La Brea Tar Pits. Below are my reasons for this recommendation:1. It's one of the world's most prolific archaeological excavation sites. That it's in the middle of Los Angeles instead of in a remote location makes it even more amazing. Scientists have excavated thousands of fossils from hundreds of species of mammals, birds, reptiles, and insects to make it one of the world's most valuable resources for archaeology, paleontology, and evolutionary biology.2. It's probably the world's most accessible archaeological excavation site. It's right on WIlshire Blvd in the Miracle Mile area, there's actually decent public transportation around there (with plans to extend the subway to go through the area), and it's walking distance from other museums (LACMA, Peterson Automotive Mueseum, and obviously the Page Museum) and shopping areas (Farmers' Market, The Grove).3. It's a bizarre place. Seeing puddles of stinky tar popping up all over the sidewalk and in the park is just strange and weird. Being aware of how many animals, even today, are still getting stuck and dying in the pits is mind-boggling. Dumb animals notwithstanding, it's amazing there's this giant mess of tar with all those skyscrapers nearby.4. It's interesting and educational. As mentioned earlier, the Tar Pits are truly a wonder, because of all the scientific data and fossils they have yielded. It's also a good opportunity to explain to kids the differences between dinosaurs and prehistoric mammals and birds. The Page Museum is fascinating, when you realize how many fossils there are and how many remarkable species have been found. If you don't want to spend money on the museum, you can still find out lots of information from their website. In any case, the most interesting part by far is the free stuff-- the pits, the excavation sites, and the statues.5. It's fun for kids. Bubbling puddles of tar are unusual and fascinating. You can climb on the giant sloth sculptures. Some of the trees are pretty good for climbing. The hill at the Page Museum is a great hill for rolling down. And there's a good pizza place (Johnny's) less than a block away.6. The name is redundant. It translates to ""The The Tar Tar Pits."" I've visited other places just because of their unusual name (such as Boring, MD and Truth or Consequences, NM).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/541DavidG541
40,Should be in Top 10,"This is a really interesting / fascinating way to spend a few hours. Its almost a secret and I cannot understand why. For the price the museum is worth visiting just to see how they have managed to rebuild some of the skeletons recovered from the pits and understand the story.To visit some of the workings where they are still recovering items from 'Tar Pits' is 'free' and walking the park looking at some of the work carried out, looking at the scene reconstructions around the bubbling pits is 'free' and you can just take your time and enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KVS79
30,Skip the museum,"The La Brea Tar Pits are pretty cool to tour. However, you can tour the grounds and see the ""tar pits"" without spending the money to go through the museum. While the museum may be of interest to some, there really isn't much to see or do unless you are really a follower of archeology or an academic (in my opinion). I think I would have found it more interesting if visiting on my own, but was not fun for the kids so much . . .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BretB719
50,Fascinating!,"Very interesting museum and grounds and so much to see and learn.Suitable for children of all ages and adults alike, don't miss the theatre show with the film on the history of the tar pits and be aware the operational pits close for viewing at 4pm so don't miss it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BryarR
50,"Interesting, informative, a hidden gem in downtown LA.","We recently visited La Brea Tar Pits and the Page Museum complex. This is a hidden gem in downtown LA, even the Cab drivers didn't know where it was. Interesting, informative and a bit of fun too, very cool learning about the prehistoric past right under everyone's feet in LA. lots of fossils but the museum is not too big so wont take up all your time in LA.

50,Third Fave place to visit in L.A.,"(After Disneyland and The Getty Center, just so you know). This place was so interesting and unique. The distant and not so distant history of that area of Los Angeles was fascinating. And to think they're still working on it. Can't wait to bring my Grandkids there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ikeagrrl
40,La Brea Tar Pits,We saw many bones of animals that were dug up there and many they constructed with the dug up bones. You can see the La Brea tar pits right outside the museum. There is a nice gift shop there and you can even bought a small bottle of the tar. It is a big museum so doesn't take long to go though it. There is a area behind glass where people are working to separate bones that you can watch. There is a parking fee of under $10 & fee for the museum also.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gardentogarden
50,Very cool!,"Very much enjoyed my visit here. It's really quite educational, and seeing the skeletons of animals they have recovered from the pits is amazing. Some of the creatures are huge! There is also a interactive exhibit where you attempt to pull a metal rod out from the tar so you can understand how difficult it would be if you were a creature stuck in the tar. So fascinating! Seeing the ""lake"" itself is also interesting. It doesn't smell too nice, but you can stand on the bridge overlooking the pits and watch the methane gas bubbles burst all over the lake. Cool! (Tip: Admission is FREE on the first Tuesday of the month.)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bh1986
50,Fantastic way to spend a morning!,Although I had read about this before I arrived I was not really prepared for what we saw! I am a geologist - so may be a tad biased!! The tar pits bubbling away are quite amazing. We walked around the gardens looking at the animal statues and also Pit 39(?) - that allows you to see what the scientists have to work in to get the specimins out. After that we went into the Page museum and were completely blown away! The way the collections was set out was excellent and the re-constructed specimins were very good indeed. I really enjoyed getting a look at the laboratory and some of the specimins that were being worked on. The video show at the start was very educational.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Honisoiquimalypense
30,"Nice Park, but a little underwhelming","Nice park and lots of fossils but not much going on with the ""active"" dig sites. The cost of the Page Museum was over $50 for 4 of us, so not cheap. With so much to see and do in LA this is a bit of a time filler if you have ever been to museums, like Chicago's field museum or other truly major museums. Great for kids field trips.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SmilinBobby

40,Fun 1/2 day trip,"We took our 4&5 year olds here while visiting LA. My husband and I had never been either. We all found it very interesting, and the tar pits outside are memorable. The park itself is very pretty and we took our Christmas card photo outside on the hill next to the museum. This is a great place to spend a few hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PartyOfFourPlease
50,All ages would enjoy this visit.,"Unlike some of the other museums, you pay for both parking and visitation; however, it's well worth it. I would say the only bad thing was figuring out where we were supposed to park. Fortunately, we did park in the correct spot (behind the museum) and then were given a $2 rebate when we purchased tickets. I don't know if that would have happened with the other lots/garages nearby. The museum is right next to the LACMA and is fun to walk both inside and out. There are tar pits to see as well as beautiful landscaping. But it's the bones found in the tar pits that will really attract old and young alike.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CAnn9
50,Love a little history in the middle of the city.,"I didn't expect the tar pits and such a big park to be hiding in the middle of the La Brea bustle. I was really excited to check it out. It's a little cheesy, but I like cheesy and I had a lot of fun walking around the area. There was a big festival going on while we were there so that definitely added to the ambiance. There are a lot of museums connected to this area. You could easily spend half a day or more just exploring what is in each building. Highly recommend for history, art and just a picnic in the park. Great discovery in L.A.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tuffy26l
50,Very interesting visit!,"I knew of this place from the game LA Noire. It was really interesting experience! I never knew that LA was home to one of the most significant archaeological sites in the US. Technically, the tar pits are not really filled with tar, but you'll have to visit to find out the rest of the details! My favorite exhibit in the museum is the skeleton of the sabre-toothed cat. Boy, those fangs are really something!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnjoelseow
50,Amazing Natural Oasis In The City,It's really refreshing to visit this bit of natural history surrounded by endless miles of concrete and skyscrapers. Walking the grounds (which is free of charge) to observe the ongoing excavations and little random seeps of asphalt (not actually tar) coming up through the lawns is really amazing. Paying the fee to tour the museum is really worthwhile too. There you can see up close and articulated all the amazing discoveries which are ongoing to this day. There's even a window where you can watch scientists and volunteers work on newly unearthed specimens. This is without a doubt our favorite spot in LA and it almost makes driving in this city's miserable traffic worthwhile!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheSpeis
40,Worth the visit,"I enjoyed myself, but I can see where this would not be everyones cup of tea. You do learn you were wrong about most of what you thought about La Brea :-). It is more educational than a tourist spot, but that's what I wanted. I was by myself and enjoyed the freedom of asking questions and not keeping my family happy and entertained. I took the walking tour and if you really want to gain knowledge this is the only way to go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrianA540
40,Nice to go with the kids.,Very nice to go with the kids. You can see the bubbles in the lake and some scientists actually working!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Meg85

40,Very interesting history & active excavation site,"I admit the La Brea Tar Pits had never been on my list of destinations before our recent trip, but I found them quite interesting. After paying $7 for parking, you are free to roam around the park, which includes several active pits of bubbling ""tar"" right in the center of LA. For an additional admission fee, you can visit the Page Museum and get much more information on the history and see the skeletal remains that have been excavated. We arrived in time for a guided tour (free with museum admission) of the outdoor pits, which was very worthwhile. We then explored the Page Museum on our own seeing the extensive collections of skeletons from mammoths to camels to all types of birds that have been found in the tar pits over the years. They are still sorting through soil and finding new remains. Who knew camels were once in LA?!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TrishG87
50,bubbling pits,While in LA the county museum is a great spot! The La Brea tar pits are an excellent afternoon. Yes the tar pits do smell like tar but the idea of how the Mammoths were swallowed up is well displayed. I really enjoyed my visit here and living in Southern California my whole life I am shocked that I never had gone before. I did not go into the actual museum itself but the grounds are free and open to the public it is a park like setting and many locals can be seen enjoying the grounds.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/whaledaker
50,Kid- friendly and fun,"We just took our grandkids here. They are 4 & 7 and were totally fascinated with the museum and the tar pits outside. They were engaged and enjoying the exhibits. The robotic exhibits really made an impression on the kids. It did not take long-a couple of hours. My only complaint was a lack of a restaurant, although we knew in advance and brought a picnic. There were vending machines, Fun for munchkins and adults,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BarbaraF388
40,La Brea tar pits,"If you are in L.A. & feel like a break from ""Hollywood"". Take a hour or so to take in 'La Brea'.Your 1st image will be the lake with its sculptures of 'Mammoths', 1 being sucked down into the bottomless pit. A close look shows the oily tar bubbling to the surface of the lake.Moving on to the ""Museum/Learning centre itself brings you to a Beautiful building well suited to its surrounding peaceful park setting.Once inside the building itself you are confronted with various ancient creatures, ranging fromSmilodons(Sabre toothed tigers) through Giant Sloths, Dire Wolves, and many many others. In both skeletal form and 'Animatronics'.During your tour youwill pass by the active research laboratory were you can observe the curators at work on various exhibits.Once outside in the 'Gorgeous' parkland you can observe ""active excavations"" in progress while strolling around.All in all 'La Brea' makes a welcome break from the 'Hurly Burly' of L.A. Slow down and Enjoy it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zacsmiff
40,Must See Near Downtown LA,"Outdoor exhibits could use a face lift and one closed down. Difficult to see active outdoor ""dig"" activities. Museum is a must see. Great educational museum for the entire family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/general5star1962
40,Extinct animals of the last ice age!,"Captured in the tar pits. Didn't have time to see the museum but we did see the tar pits. I think it's one of those once in a lifetime experiences. The tar pits are important in understanding the animals and plants that thrived on this land in the last ice age (for tens of thousands of years).... which ended about 10,000 years ago.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/afbf18
40,Scientists at work,"We loved the park and seeing the various pits. The museum's exhibits were mostly typical fare for this type of museum, BUT the highlight was the fishbowl lab. The lab is surrounded by windows, so visitors can watch scientists and volunteers as they sort and clean fossil finds. Interesting for kids, but my husband and I loved it too! Apparently, the museum welcomes volunteers daily. If I ever visit LA again, I will certainly investigate the opportunity to volunteer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ExplorerAmy
50,Great experience,"After having heard of the La Brea Tar Pits growing up it was a great experience to finally get to see them first hand. The Page Museum was very educational and worth the entry costs, especially because it helps to keep the research going. There is no where else like this in the world, I would definitely encourage anyone with the opportunity to make a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelinRanger
40,Cool seeing the various finds,We just did the free walking tour as we only had about a 1/2 hour but were glad that we stopped. We went to the section where active digs were being conducted so we heard the activity and loved seeing the various skeletons on display throughout the grounds. The kids enjoyed it and we eventually got used to the smell of tar during our walk. It was great for the kids because they had signs and explanations of the various finds. I'm sure it would have been great to go into the museum (there is a charge for this) and see more if we had the time but it's worth stopping if you can only do the outside area (definitely can see it all in less than an hour).,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shamrock4
30,Small museum.,"Now the title sounds a bit negative but that has to do with my expectations. Since the grounds on which the museum sits are quite large I thought the museum would have more to show for. Entry fee for adults is $12,-, but in 30/45 minutes you have seen it all. I guess with kids it will take you a lot longer.The movie they show about the tar pits is quite informative and I think you should see it to fully understand how the pits came into existance and how the animals got stuck in the pits. Go visit one of the active digging holes on the grounds and of course don't forget to take picture at the large pit in front of the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nieb20475
50,LaBrea Tar Pits & Page Museum-a fantastic place to visit,"This is a beautiful park on Wilshire Boulevard, where you can stroll into the past, learn about the Pleistocene, and then explore the museum. Inside the graphics and displays reach visitors on multiple age levels. The atrium is an oasis, the short informative film entertaining, and the building's design uniquely suited to the site. I'll be back on my next visit to LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnnMarieB175
50,Fantastic Place to Visit!,"La Brea Tar Pits is a favorite in my family! We used to live near LA and were members of the museum. We recently came back to CA on a family trip, and naturally this was one of our stops. The museum is very interesting. We particularly enjoy seeing the wall of fossilized skulls and watching the paleontologists at work in the offices through the big glass observation window! Definitely come here!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LuckyLyndi
40,World-class,"The first thing to know about the Page museum is that it shows a selection of the findings from what must be one of the most important paleontological sites in the World. There are thousands of items on display, but these represent only a tiny fraction of the finds. We loved the 'goldfish bowl', where, in between impressive remains of mammoths and sabre-toothed cats, a dedicated team cleans bones and searches for micro-fossils (ancient beetle wings, mouse teeth, seeds) in piles of what looks like black dust. To see the skeleton of Zed, a huge mammoth, displayed alongside the skeleton of a weasel and a rattllesnake, together with a case containing some 4,000 dire-wolf skulls, brings home the amazing, painstaking work that has gone on over decades to unravel this complex and fascinating 3D jigsaw puzzle. The museum brings to life a lost world from 40,000 years ago, and is well worth taking half a day to explore.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/happy_hobbit
40,Great for children,"I only did the walking tours and didnt go inside the museum as I had limited time, but it was worth taking the time to stroll through, very interesting! I think if you have children it would be a day well spent! Saw a bunch of little kids running around :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lelanies_13
40,Tar Pits and more,"Most people go by the pits and look around, but to truly understand the tar pits and their history, you need to take the time and visit the Page Museum and learn about the area and what L.A. was like before people moved in. Very educational.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lagiant
50,Brilliant!,This tourist site never gets old. La Brea/Page Museum is still an active site with oozing tar all over the place. On this visit we did the group tour which is extremely informative. We learned quite a bit about the history of the area and more about the continued research that is on going.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jc_planet
50,Fascinating Part of LA History,"Despite being a fossil aficionado, I had visited LA several times and not stopped by the Page Museum. So on my most recent trip, I was determined to see it. It is amazing that there is still a big tar pit right in the middle of LA. The museum was interesting and the fact that they are still finding fossils is amazing. For me, the coolest exhibit was the canister filled with tar and a plunger so you can experience how impossible it would be for an animal to escape from the tar pits. Our outdoor tour guide was a little long winded and our 7 year old got restless so we left the tour and walked around the grounds to see smaller tar pits. Be sure to see one of the pits they are currently excavating. It's unique to see how they put the tar in wooden crates and then when it hardens, they chisel through that. We saw a couple of people chiseling away in the hot sun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/winsomelosesum
40,Amazing,It's just amazing that there are active tar pits in the middle of a city. Be sure to walk around everywhere since you don't want to miss some of the smaller pits. Be careful where you walk because it's hard to get tar off shoes. The actual museum is a big letdown. I don't think it has changed in over 30 years. Skip the museum and just do the pits.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mominct24
50,Learned so much!,"Lived by the Page Museum for years before finally going and I'm so happy I did! What a cool museum. I learned so much! Like that saber tooth cats used to live in North America. And giant sloths. The museum has an impressive number of fossils to view, there's a lot of helpful information provided, and the outside is lovely and well-maintained.Scientists/field workers are still recovering fossils, and one of the rooms where they work is open-viewing to the public, which is cool. You can't talk to them per se, but you can watch them work and they can write things on paper to show you so you know what exactly they're working on.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Brittany_11_10
50,Amazing!,"So much I never knew! And the thousands of bones they've recovered is mind-boggling (404 Dire Wolf skeletons, for example). Not recreations, but actual remains of pre-historic animals trapped in the asphalt. Only criticism is that the museum needs a ramp or elevator on the parking lot side of the building from the handicapped parking spaces.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bunnidancer
50,Amazing!,"This is a really cool place, and very hard to believe that this amazing place is located right in the heart of Los Angeles! We arrived there early and toured the tar pits outdoors first before the museum opened (and got free parking in the lot there because we had arrived so early). We enjoyed looking at the outdoor tar pits, especially where the active project areas were going on. The museum was really great too and did a great job interpreting what happened here and what we can learn from all of the fossil remains. We saw lots of people of all ages enjoying the exhibits. We spent the whole morning here!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lifeisagr8adventure
30,2 hours at most,"Mixed reviews among my family. The fascination wears off after a bit- it's Ice age not dinosaurs as they keep repeating in the tour. The tar (asphalt- as they keep correcting you) still bubbles up, there are still some active digs going on but after 2 hours - 1 inside, one outside- you get the idea.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SandiH134
50,Great history tour,This place is well worth a look. A treasure of ice age history and something that interested the 12-42 year old age group we had.Lots of extinct skeletons and stories of what happened.Also live bubbling tar pits outside to see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RooActon
40,Great place to visit,We enjoyed la brea tar pits museum. Was a little pricey for what was on offer but I would recommend a visit to this place. We were 2 adults visiting but bringing kids would have been great too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/05louandscott
40,Very interesting and informational,The museum in-between the La Brea tar pits is very well done. The exhibits are educational and definitely worth the time to visit the museum. It's amazing to have such an extensive collection of Ice Age animals in one place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravellingDutchie
40,Interesting,"The museum is located in a park. The staff and volunteers are very helpful. The orientation film at eh beginning of the visit is interesting, although somewhat dated. The museum has a good collection of fossils and skeletons. It is interesting to see the lab where the volunteers are going through the artifacts and cleaning them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tbugCanada
40,La Brea Tar pits,We enjoyed this short trip to the museum. We decided not to go through the museum because it was 15 per person and we had a group of 6. But outside they had several pits to view which was good enough for us. Interesting and quite horrible for the large animals who got stuck in them. Nice grounds and looks like an interesting museum which also had a gift shop to buy souvenirs.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/laurenh33
50,The Past surrounded by the Present,A great look into the past. The pits are located in downtown Los Angeles. You pay to park at Hancock Park but the grounds are no charge. You will have a charge to get into the Page Museum but the displays are well done and worth the charge. The interactive displays for children are well done and hold their attention. Being a week-end there was no activity at the pit or the lab. Also at this site is the LACMA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KathieL798
50,Amazing and informative!,"Our guide was superb! She drew in every member of our group, from the youngest to the eldest, with her enthusiasm for each exhibit. We figured she must have been a career educator.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HughandKathyR
40,A little disappointing,"I hesitate to write this review because I think it's really imporant to support the sciences and gbe arts.However, when we entered there was a sign that read pit 91 was open and the hours it was open. We watched the film explaining the tar pits and fuscussing in detaill pit 91, so it got us really excited to see it. We finished viewing the galleries in the page museum and walked outside to see pit 91. We get to the viewing area and there is a sign stating that the work in the pit is on hold for 5 yesrs until they complete project 23.I really wished theyhgad said something inside the myseum or after the film. It was really a let down.The galleries in the page museum are full of prehistoric fossils they found in the pits. It's very cool. The tar pits are outside and are free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chicago1450
50,Different than i thought it would be.,"Well it is different than i pictured it although seeing it made all the photos of it over the years make sense.We really enjoyed it as a family. well worth a stop. I wish we could have done the rest of the museum that was on the grounds.The amount of information that came out of the tar is amazing. The folks who sit in the ""fish bowl looking at all the tiny little peices have a gift. I couldnt do that for one hour. Well worth watching them do it for a few minutes tho.Tip: if you go to see the big rock (you'll know it when you see it) dont walk on the concrete walls. There is a Mall cop there with a wistle to keep people off the wall to keep them from falling. Although it did kinda make me appreciate my job a little more ;)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jebg_11
30,Nice to follow up after the park,"The museum is pretty small. It took us an hour. There are a few interactive exhibits, but mainly you are reading about the things they find in the pit as well as other ones in the world. There is a wall of wolf skulls, all found in the pit there. You can also observe excavators and scientists in a lab. Our son enjoyed looking at everything and wandering around. It was a nice finish to the park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/utopianidealist
40,another museum trip,"I took my grandsons here and my 15yr old loved it very much. my 5yr old was a bit afraid of some of the items there but, overall we did enjoy our visit. interesting things to learn.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ophie24
50,Terrific,"Another LA must see, incomparable, cannot be duplicated in any other part of the world! Dedicated volunteers provide guided tours. The relentless hard work that has lead to the reconstruction of a bygone era has really added to scientific knowledge.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ZiaChaudhuri
50,The pits are pretty cool,"We dodged the museum as it's pretty pricey, but the pits themselves are fascinating. They bubble away beautifully and we spent about an hour just meandering about looking at the different sites. It's a real gem in amongst downtown LA bustle",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Frewba
50,"""Ice-age"" fossils galore, bubbling tar pits.","Beautiful park/museum with bubbling tar-pits where the ancient mammals were trapped still out in the open. The smell of tar pervades the area giving a genuine and authentic feel. The Page museum is an architectural beauty, and the exibits are extraordinarily stunning. The fish-bowl science lab where the bones are cleaned and assembled adds to the magic. Also not to big - the kids won't get tired! Great place, especially if you like sabertoothed cats, giant sloths, mammoths, or any of the other characters from ""Ice age"".",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ErikJSO
50,Enjoyable!,"My family and I just viewed the tar pits outside and paid for the parking. It was really interesting to see all the tar and learn about it! We didn't go into the museum as it was a little pricey, but it's nice to just stop by and look around at the tar.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrookeHarris
50,Fun and informative,"A really great place for kids! We learned a lot about prehistoric animals. The docents/employees were informative. The displays are great and the tar pits themselves are amazing (although stinky). It took us about 1.5 hr to see it, but we could have spent longer if we weren't in a hurry.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rf_family_travel
40,A Nice Place to Spend A Few Hours,"Personally, I love this place. But I have taken several guests here from out of town. Some people love this type of stuff and others don't. If you are science oriented you will probably like it.Inside the museum you will see lots of skulls of sabre tooth tigers etc. You may even see someone working live on a fosil or skull in the lab. They also have a pretty good movie on how the tar pits were formed. One animal goes into the tar and gets stuck. Then another animal goes into the tar to eat the first animal, and they get caught etc.Outside the museum there is an area where you can see (and really smell) the tar pits. They have some replicas of mammoths getting caught in the tar. Overall this is not a bad place to spend a few hours. There is plenty of parking nearby for a fee.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnB00007
50,So Cool,"This place is amazing to me! To learn more about the area, how fossils were formed there, how they were excavated, and how they were pieced together is so cool. You can even watch ""scientists in action"" through what's called the fish bowl. Park on the street if you can OR receive a $2 discount in the lot when you pay the $12 entrance fee. 2 hours is more than enough time to enjoy everything this museum has to offer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jade830
40,fascinating,"this place is great for kids and adults alike. how can you not be fascinated by the large and exotic creatures that once roamed greater Los Angeles? to think of this sprawling concrete jungle being covered with trees, swamps, mammoths, giant sloths, sabertooth cats and jaguars 3x the size of the modern day leopard is mind blowing. it's interesting to see the work of the paleontologists in the lab.the only reason i gave 4 stars was that Pit 91 is inactive for 5 years so you can't see any excavation in progress.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/harbrsl
50,One in a Milliion,"It is amazing that this is the only place in the world that has this many fossils. You could save a few dollars if you park on the street if you rented a car. Plus, there are food trucks around the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cristobalcurry
40,Affordable family fun,"I have to say the tar pits weren't at all like I expected. I've seen them featured in movies & I expected a busy ""tourist attraction."" I was so surprised to find a fun inexpensive educational experience my whole family enjoyed! It was very interesting to walk through the tar pits & learn about the excavations. My kids had a blast in the museum. We spent half a day here & will probably revisit in a few years!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jm128
50,La Breat Tar Pits worth your time,The Tar Pits were great. Good history of the area and lots of fun. Lot of bones from the pit. Lots of LA history in conjunction with the pits. The Farmers Market is in the same area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ed258536
30,"Good Museum, one visit is enough","The museum was a good experience and interesting at the how much they have been able to get out of the tar pits. If you are visiting its recommended, but once you've been here once there's never any huge desire to go back into the museum as the tar pits are the real attraction.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/The_Roaming_Raven
50,Surprisingly good,"Nice museum - good video giving an overview of the museum and history, tons and tons and tons of fossils, got to watch actual people cleaning fossils, see the dig area. Nice for the whole family. One-of-a-kind place. Parking was easy ($10). On the same site as the art museum - though we didn't go there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelerKate
50,Fun for the Senses,"The outdoor aspects of the museum are free. The indoor part of the museum costs. If you are a member of the Natural History Museum, this is part of your membership. The indoor atrium is full of waterfalls, turtles and koi. It has nothing to do with the Tar Pits, but we always make a stop to see the turtles.Check out the ""fishbowl,"" the window where volunteers painstakingly clear the bones of the critters that have fallen victim to the tar. Look for the Woolly Mammoth skeleton that has been named Zed. They've been excavating him for years.Outdoors, kids can spend hours listening for bubbles in the front 'tar pit' or wander back to the actual tar field, or to the Dig 91 where the volunteers get dirty in the excavation pit, or the observation pit. Kids love to look for the tar that seeps up in the grass as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/halobb
50,A Different Kind of LA Wildlife - the Prehistoric Kind,"A visit to this site and museum in the heart of LA will really stir the imagination! It is hard to picture the heart of this bustling city as it was 30-40,000 years ago - with saber toothed cats, packs of wolves, massive wooly mammoths, sloths, a variety of predator birds and other extinct wildlife roaming free - until, of course, they wandered into one of the many tar pits that swallowed them, that is! These same tar pits have enabled us to ""see"" how it might have been, though, because the remains of thousands of animals of that period have been found there and they are displayed so that they bring them back to life. Paleontologists and countless volunteers and students have painstakingly preserved and impressively displayed major finds at the Page Museum. The work is ongoing and we visitors also get to see some of that impressive process. It's a fascinating place - and the grounds with their life sized prehistoric animal sculptures would be perfect for a picnic!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/flowerlady28
40,A pleasant surprise,"Even though the museum is small,there is a lot to see and do.Take a walk through the museum( a small fee) and there are plenty of exhibits of skeletons and bones and general history of the area.If you have a spare 20 minutes,watch the video as well.It's nice to see signs that say ""please touch"" There are tarpits outside to view as well(free).We all enjoyed it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AndyMOz
30,This was nothing special for us since,"We thought this would be a great spot to visit, but quickly realized it is not very special. We are only a few hours from DC here on the east coast and can see all the fossils we want for free. The fee to see what few they have here was way out of line and not worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wkrupa
50,Nice afternoon,We went on the day they had free entrance. Museum was interesting even though I thought it was rather small. Outside tarpits were amazing to see. Our favorite part was the pit 91 ...the young lady at the little info desk there was so informative and let our son touch the polished skull they had for show. And she explained everything about the large underground size of it reaching through parts of the city. Etc. Very interesting!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VJN_13
50,A very pleasant surprise in the middle of LA,"My husband loved this one. He had a life long wish to see the La Brea tar pits. Quite an amazing fossil depository. A bit ""for the kids"", but that's to be expected.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LPNSW
50,Great little place,Very cool to see the tar pits bubblng! Loved that they had viewin windows so that you could see the tar pits where they were excavating fossils. The museum was small but wonderful. They had several hands on exhibits for little kids that were great and an area where you could see them cleaning up fossils. Definitely worth a trip.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AAttryde
50,The tar pit,The best part about is the tar pit found in the front.....I paid to go in and was disappointed. I was totally impressed with the elephants and the smell of the tar outside....the inside was just a let down (maybe I was just expecting to much).,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LivelkDying
40,See it and smell it! Get in free with museum membership from home!,"My girls (12, 10 & 6) loved this museum. The tar pits are cool! BUT- do not stay near them too long. It really affected my daughters throat (burning) for days after. It's hard to walk away bc so interesting. The two movies we saw were very educational and entertaining. There is a fun substance in the gift shop that acts like tar but has none of the bad! We used our museum membership at home to get in free :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mollie129
40,Nice place for a short visit,We enjoyed stopping by the museum for a quick visit. The museum is a bit smaller than I was picturing but it was a nice place to visit- probably spent less than 2 hours there. I would recommend finding street parking close to the museum if you are not planning on staying longer than 2 hours or else you will have to pay much more to park at the museum parking lot.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/notesfork
50,great place to see at least once,"I love science so visiting the tar pits is a must do when in LA area. Parking is either on street or lots. it is a nice easy pace place, no rushing",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/millie516
50,What a Gem,"Not sure if the school children appreciate the natural wonder that they were visiting, but they did enjoy the activities inside the museum. The museum was even better than expected.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PallasAustralia
50,Page Museum,This was an interesting museum to attend. The La Brea Tar Pits are so interesting and who would believe they are in the middle of Los Angeles. There are millions of fossil that have been found and the scientist are still discovering new ones. It was fun watching the scientist through the glass working on small particles of dirt through a microscope looking for more fossils. It makes us think what was here before humans and how they had to live. This is well worth a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mhood_VA
40,Not bad,"We arrived early on a Saturday and parked in the lot behind the museum. If arriving after noon, the lot may be full. Visitors pay to enter the Page museum. Good selection of displays, lots of information if you are into this type of thing. I personally accompanied my husband (he loved it, so he may have given this a 5). Some interactive displays, plus movies. Good gift shop selection selling a variety of souvenirs. The museum is located within the tar pits, so if you are short on time, or money, entrance to the grounds surrounding the tar pits is free. Still have the opportunity to observe some of the displays, pretty gardens, and other information. If the weather is nice, a great place for a picnic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChihuahuasMama
40,"Short, Educational, and Fun","The first and last time I visited the LA Brea Tar Pits and the Page museum was in 1986. I was young, single, and eager for an adventure. 27 years later I'm older, married and still lustful for adventure, and I’ve found it in small doses at the Page museum and tar pits. The museum seems smaller than I remembered, but those bubbling tar pits still holds my fascination with earth's past and undiscovered mysteries. This is the only museum that I know of where all the fossils and reconstructed dinosaurs were unearthed by paleontologists just 100 yards from the museum’s entrance! There is enough tar rising from the earth around this park to pave a freeway from Los Angeles to Hawaii. Just think what secrets lie beneath the surface yet to be discovered.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BENelson
40,Sticky black fun,"After viewing the oozing tar lake for several minutes, we realized that there was an eruption outside the fence near the street-side sidewalk. We made the mistake of touching the tar. Do not do this, as it is the definition of sticky and you will smell like a new road for the rest of the day.Loved how it was smack in the middle of the city...not some distant outpost. Would recommend for an hour or so.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Yeahbut246
50,Amazing place to visit,"The La Brea Tar Pits and the Page Museum should be a must-visit for any tourist in L.A.The lake with bubbling oil showing sculptures of mammoths trapped is just a sight to behold.The museum is breath-taking. Watching the remains of huge mammals that roamed the area and met their end buried in the tar pits was amazing. You can see the size comparison with mammoth skeletons, saber-tooth cats, etc.With the price of admission you can go to their two tours that show the museum with a guide and the excavation pits.This was one of the great highlights of my recent visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sid_LAS_84
40,Educational and beautiful setting!,"Went here recently with my cousin when I was visiting her in the area. I thought the park itself was really nice - I could totally see spending time here if I lived in the area - what a great place for a picnic, a walk, etc. We went to the museum which was very nicely done and not too much to take in. The videos that run on a continuous loop are very interesting and worth stopping to watch. The ""fishbowl"" where you can watch the paleontologists at work is really neat as well. The LACMA is also right next door so, while this isn't probably enough to take up an entire day, it is a great stop to make if you want to take i a few museums in a day (the arts & crafts museum is also right there but I didn't get to see it).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ABB1976
50,Love it,"We went with our children nearly 20 years ago and it hasn't changed much, but it is still great. I still find it really difficult to get my head around its very existence in the middle of LA. Amazing that it hasn't be concreted over.Being Memorial Day, parking was a nightmare, but luckily all the offices over the road were closed and their car park was open.Sadly we were too late to go and see the pit they are still working on. Still it gives me a reason to go back. Hopefully it wont be another 20 years.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janeandallen
40,A very fun afternoon,What a fun afternoon. The tar pits and the surrounding park are free and well worth a visit. The onsite museum is worth the price of admission. The whole experience can be done in one afternoon for sure.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Firemann2003
50,"Great to see, but be careful with parking","We had a great time exploring the pits around the park and visiting the museum. You can find areas where new smaller pit outbursts are forming around the park. We found one developing in some hedges.We only had one problem and that was with parking. We parked with no problem. However, we found out thru the cashier at the gift shop that they could validate our parking. We retrieved the ticket that was placed in our windshield and had them validate it. When we exited the parking lot, the attendant said he could not accept that portion of the ticket. He claimed to have given us the other half when we drive in. He also claimed to have told us about validating our ticket which he DID NOT! He kept smiling and said there was nothing he could do unless he got the other half of the ticket. So we basically were taken for our money. He said his name was Jesus (Mexican version) and I'm not a racist because I'm of Mexican descent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FloridaSun4me
30,Nice Park but ...,It's a nice park in the city but the tar pit wells it's a fenced in tar pit. Museum was pretty good for $12 a person but I would not say it's a must see for anybody visiting,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bennisennis
50,Great short family trip,"Perfect for a 1-2 hour or longer visit if you wish. Kids loved the pits and museum, movies are done well, entertaining and educational.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EC437
30,"Very interesting, but probably not worth a detour or aspecial trip","Asphalt welled-up from the earth here and over tens of thousands of years many thousands of critters got stuck in, and then fossilized in the tar. More recently, the city of Los Angeles was built around these pools of tar. You can see (and small) the tar, and observe many of the fossils that have been extracted.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SteveAtSapphire
50,A spur of the moment idea was the best of the day,"First off it is free to walk around, bring cash to pay 7.00 for parking and you know it is going to a good cause (and less expensive then across the street) Pretty in expensive for an educational and fun time. They are still excavating and you can watch paleontologists uncover new discoveries, polish bones ect. and they have a neat informative video in the museum. It is also in the museum area of LA county so you can trek across the street to the folk art museum (it is a neat view just from the out side. and next door is the LACAM.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeahWynn
40,Worth The Visit,"I took my son here and he really enjoyed the whole museum. There is a whole lot to see, a whole lot of exhibits. This is set near a bunch of other museums so if you finish early you can walk to those as well. There are food trucks parked across the street which have really amazing food!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BeastMode36
50,Great low cost educational experience in center of LA,"We did not have a lot of time (2 hours or less) and looked into many many other options to explore during our short time frame and determined this would pack the most bang for our time/buck. We went at the end of the day (brilliant) and parked in the easily accessible lot (no structure to navigate!). Drive up, pay nominal fee and walk on into a beautiful setting. I would recommend going online to their webpage and follow one of their suggested itineraries. The park is well layed out, and easily navigated from viewing area, to archelogical dig and works in progress. The late afternoon provided nice temperature for our walk and no crowds. We ended our tour with the Page museum, which after 4:30 pm (30 minutes before closing) was half off! What a deal, as if you are a seasoned museum goer, can easily be done in the time. We have two kids (13 and 10) and we were able to view alll the exhibits, watch the archeologists work (great viewing area where you can see actual WORK being done by the scientests themselves) and ask a few questions from the volunteers and visit the gift store without feeling rushed. Great life size wooly mammoth (real fossils from the dig), saber tooth, dire wolves, ground sloth (over six feet tall) - it was a fantastic, inexpensive and very enjoyable excursion.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wprior
50,Very cool Place to visit,"Loved the very work in progress nature of this museum, it was fun for the kids to explore, lots of cool history here. This is worth checking out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IanB761
50,Very interesting place in a great park,"My first piece of advice is to get there early, especially on weekends, to avoid parking issues. The walk aroudn the park to view the gardens and tar pits was lovely about 9:00 a.m. Lots of people using this lovelay place for avisriety of activities, and the pits themselves are intesting if rather unimpressive. Good sifnage to explain the importance of the area and the main lake in front of the museum on the Miracle Mile side was fascinating with all the gas bubbles coming to the surface. The muweum itself is a great display of the fossils found in the pits and also does a good job of explaining how they are prepared for use.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/614michaelm614
50,A working archeological project,"The Page Museum is very informative regarding the tar pits that trapped thousands of mammoths, dire wolves, giant sloths, and other species thousands of years age. There are numerous displays of full-sized skeletal remains and some moving life-size models. Film presentations explain everything very well. On the grounds themselves, the tar still oozes, and you can view digs and projects that they are currently working on.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeeD916
50,Active tar pits amid Wilshire Blvd bussle,"The Page Museum was built long after I left California - I believe I visited the La Brea Tar Pits as a school girl in the 60's. I have managed to visit it twice since the museum was built and it continues to be of interest. There is active paleontology and lots of reconstructed skeletons of Saber Tooth Cats, Mastodons and other ice age creatures. Don't be looking for dinosaurs since they were long gone at the time of the ice age. It's amazing there are still areas where the tar bubbles up on the lawn. And glance up to the new buildings of the contemporary world!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carolingaround
30,Very Educational,Great for children and young students. Be sure you allow plenty of time to see everything. Good for anyone interested in dinosaurs or the history of the Wilshire corridor.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlendaleGirl1
50,Museum was an excellent educational experience,My aunt and I spent some time at this museum. They have excellent displays of various items. Also discussed how the tar affected these creatures years and years ago. I would recommend going and I certainly would go again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ErickS15
50,Much more interesting than I had imagined!!,"This was an amazing display of Ice Age Animals. I had not realized that Los Angeles once housed these animals, some of which were huge. The fossils are real. We took the guided tour, (no additional fee), from a naturalist who gave us a wealth of knowledge. She also guided us through a outside pit 91. There is so much to learn, that i could return,and learn muchnew information.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ZCAlady
40,Good but missable,If you are really into fossils and the like then definitely go here. It was good but I would now I have seen it I won't be beating down the door to get back in. My 5yo did enjoy it and it killed about an hour or so of time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MissMinelli
50,"Its Jerassic Park, but Real !!","So Many people come to California and Miss this Place, its not just a Museum,but also the Real Place where some of the worlds Bigg Dino'S livedand were stuck in Tar for all of us to see. you can see the out side,or or pay to see the inside.Kind of a once in a Lifetime PlaceRitchie H.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RitchieH_12
40,Oil Field in Middle of Hollywood? Yes! And it was cool!,"I am so glad the original owner of this property had the foresight 100 years ago to preserve this area as a museum. Nice grounds, easy location. There is publlic parking behind the location and you can also park at the LAMARC parking lot across street. Just go to LAMARC ticket center and pay $10 for all day. Take the 30 minute tour, free on tuesdays, very informative and you get to see active excavation sites for fossils. The history is really cool too. We actually got to see them recover a piece of deer fossil on the tour. We did not pay to go inside museum because the outside was free. I feel like we got everything we wanted to see without paying for museum access.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nawirl
30,Worth a look,"This place wasn't on our 'must do' list in LA, however was interesting. I did not know much about the history, but the museum is informative. It has some GREAT animatronics (haha!)It was interesting to see the lab and work in progress.Take a walk through the gardens even if you don't go inside.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ellews
30,Nice little museum but loved the actual pits,"The La Brea tar pits are like an anomaly sitting beside a major thoroughfare in the bustling city of Los Angeles. From Wilshire Boulevard you can see the main pit full of asphalt with large bubbles of gas coming to the surface every now and then with a ""Whoosh"" sound. It smells like a newly paved tar road. In the same lake are models of some of the animals that have been extracted in past years.There are quite a few pits in La Brea Park. It doesn't cost anything to visit the pits as the park is open to the public. It is a nice place to wander around. The only cost involved is if you visit the adjacent Page Museum, which documents the history of the tar pits and has various skeletal remains plus educational displays and animatronics. There is also a viewing area where you can see scientists at work as they clean and classify the remains. A nice little aside is the atrium which is like a mini rainforest complete with ponds filled with fish and tortoises.Visiting the museum is cheap - only $12 for adults (2013 price). It is free on the first Tuesday of the month (except July and August.)You can get there as a stop on the Starline hop on-hop off bus or catch a local bus which stops nearby.Worth a visit. LACMA (Los Angeles County Museum of Art) and the Petersen Auto Museum are very close as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Roddlez
50,"Very, Very Cool!!!! Don't Miss This Place!!","This was on my childhood bucket list... and I was ecstatic when I had some free time to stop by the Tar Pits during a recent business trip to LA.After all these years of anticipation, the tar pits did not disappoint my expectations!Make sure you walk the entire property and appreciate the working areas of the complex, and watch all of the videos in the musuem as they really help explain (and dispel some myths) about what happened at the Tar Pits and how complex the excavation effort is.So if you're even causally into dinos, don't miss this stop while in LA, you won't be sorry!!P.S. - One quick tip/point.... you can walk the grounds and see the pits and working areas for free. Only the museum costs money. I think the museum is worth it, but if the cost is an issue, stop by and just view the pits and working excavation areas... it's still worth it!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OutdoorValleyForge
50,Fascinating,"The have the best collection of ice age fossils in the world. Not only were the exhibits interesting, but you also get to watch the archeologists at work in the 'fishbowl' lab.Everything was really well explained.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HildegardeG
30,Somewhat interesting.,"The museum made our visit to the Tar Pits, not be as down in the ""pits"" as it had turned out to be.The museum was interesting, yet some of the people we visited with (after seeing the boring tar pits) didn't want to venture into the museum, for fear of more boredom. One recalls the movie(s) based around the tar pits. Glad we saw it, but won't be in a hurry to return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/374dw
40,Good for all ages,"This was a great museum for all ages. It was like walking into a piece of history and being able to experience it yourself. I am an anthropology major and knew most of what the guided tour was talking about, but it still was enjoyable. The paleo lab was cool to see as it was a work in progress right before your eyes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alrstars
50,Fred Flinstone Fun,"Do you remember how the animals would fall into the tar pits in the cartoon? Well, that's what this is all about. The museum tells the story and shows the fossils, but the really cool part is taking a tour with the guide past the bubbling black goo and hearing the stories of the saber toothed cats and dire wolves who got stuck and fossilized tens of thousands of years ago!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelbug0164
30,Very interesting!,The middle atrium was pretty boring. Other than that very interesting. Cool skeletons and informative facts!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AMyers331
40,Something Different to do!,"Had to learn about this one. Friends told us about it--where more dinasaur bones have been found than any other place. Pits still have bubbles coming up. We were very tired and didn't stay long, but was interesting, and could see the pits without paying for anything but parking. Cost for museum, but children would love it, and on a pretty weather day, could stay on lawn and let children run and play, and just enjoy!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnneC31
50,Excellent Science,"I have taken my 2nd grade classes there, as well as my grandchildren, and feel confident that they are seeing real science in action.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BarbaraE974
50,"The La Brea Tar Pits are NOT ""the pits""",The tar pits are a great introduction to Los Angeles. Lovely exhibits reveal LA's prehistoric past. We meet the animals they have found and are still looking for on the very grounds of the museum. The best part is seeing the tar pits. They are still bubbling!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deabs8
40,A lovely experience,"I had heard about La Brea and the associated museum from friends from LA. On my last visit to LA I decided to go along - actually not expecting very much! I confess that LA is not my favourite of US cities, and I do not expect much of the attractions. I expected to see a plastic reconstruction of Jurassic Park! However, I was surprised.The museum is tastefully arranged, and the exhibits well arranged. The legends on the walls are explanatory, and easy to follow. I particularly loved the quiet garden in the middle - with plants and water feature - along with turtles. I was fascinated by a central laboratory with glass paneling, allowing visitors to see the scientists and assistants working on the discoveries.There are many well displayed exhibits, and they have a wide range of animals. I felt I got to know a bit about pre-history.Outside there is a small tar pit, and allows people to see what the animals got trapped in. Bubbling tar, and water was a fascinating sight.I am glad I went to see it. I suspect youngsters would really enjoy it - and I would take children.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MikeBoyle
50,Wonderful Ice Age Fossil Collection,I love this museum. There are so many fossils to look at. The tar pits contain the most ice age mammal fossils found anywhere in the world. I was most impressed by the 400 wolf skulls that were individually housed in small glass cubes that lined a whole wall. Those were only a part of the total skulls that they have recovered so far. I wanted to see at least one saber-tooth tiger skull. I saw more than I could have wished for. My tour took about an hour and a half. I took my time looking at each fossil displayed. I loved it and would recommend it to all ages.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sealife1960
40,Interesting,We had fun looking at all of the bones and fossils. We went on the first Tuesday of the month when the admission was free!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/denelizalex
40,Unusual museum,"This is very interesting and a small museum that does not take long say 40 min to see it all then you have LAMOCA next door and it has 5 buildings of which we saw one with some good Picassos and Ledgers. It is amazing to see the tar around the building in the grass, they are still working and discovering bones, all of the bones are real. Where as when you visit most museums of this nature they are often fake. They had a wall of wolf skulls numbering1400 but they found about 14,0000 found here. Cost $35 to get in for family of 4",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrsWorldly
50,"Both are a ""must do""","The La Brea Tar Pits is a fun educational place for kids and adults. Even if you are just visiting the area, It is easy to find. You can see the tar pits for free but must pay for the museum. Without the museum, the tar pits don't make much sense. Set aside 1-2 hours for this attraction.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AuntGram
40,Worth a quick trip.,"My husband has always wanted to stop at the Tar Pits. I thought the Page Museum was nicely laid out and interesting. For visiting on a weekend it wasn't overly busy so we got to enjoy the exhibits up close. I would like to have had a docent on the grounds, especially where the pits were being actively worked on to answer questions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tap61
40,Good for kids of all ages,"Located at the famous La Brea Tar Pits, the Page Museum houses and explains many of the discoveries made there. Visitors may view the mounted skeletons and learn the prehistoric and human history of the Hancock Park area. A windowed laboratory allows observation of some paleontology going on. The museum itself is good for an hour or two, depending on attention spans. Tours lead outside to the tar pits themselves, and guests might get a glimpse of actual work being performed on bone-laden blocks of tar from a nearby excavation. Note: the anguished mammoth family depicted in sculpture near Wilshire Boulevard is rather romanticized and unrealistic.As with all Los Angeles County museums, admission is free the first Tuesday of each month.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/snowburds
40,Fascinating for the insight at Los Angeles,"Friends had been recommending we see this and once we visited we could see why. The Tar Pits , effectively bitumen lakes, had preserved skeletons very well from animals in the Los Angeles region for around 30,000 years. What was fascinating was how the animal life had changed in that period from large lions , Camels , Horses now extinct to what we have today..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pala49
40,Cool for kids,Great educational and cool place for school age kids. Well worth a visit.Parking is easy and inexpensive. Can couple it with another LA attraction,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tjr1973

10,Don't bother,"My husband wanted to see the tar pits when we went to Hollywood. He thought they were actually tar pits. Wrong. We paid $9.00 to get into the parking lot which we thought paid for the museum. Wrong again. The ""tar pits"" are just a pond of water that has methane gas bubbling out of it. Nothing to see. The museum was another $12 to get into. We didn't bother with that so I couldn't tell you if it was any good or not. After we left, I noticed that there was parking on the street in front of the park. I would recommend parking there if you want to see the ""tar pits"" but I would say don't waste your time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shelli0502
40,Excellent dose of local history of the area,"La Brea Tarpits and the Page Museum are located right downtown in LA. Not far from Hollywood area, it was fun just driving around town to the museum.First off, the parking lot right behind the museum was an excellent value. It is right off of Curson Ave. We parked there all day for $7 (Sunday).The Page Museum was a little expensive for a family of 6. It was $12 per adult and $5 per child. We started off with the movie right at the beginning which was worth the time. It is full of interesting photos of facts about how the tar pits were discovered, etc.The museum itself is pretty small. You can get around the whole thing in an hour. The fossils are incredible and unique compared to others I have seen in Natural History Museums. The atrium is wonderful! Great place to take shots of birds, trees, fish and turtles. The gift shop is awesome. Loaded with cool things for kids in all price ranges.Next we walked around outside the museum on the grounds. You do not have to pay to do this. The tar pits outside are really cool. There is also an observation deck to see a real pit being excavated. We could see actual fossils sticking out of the ground.All in all, I think the Page Museum was worth the cost.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tasiadoo
30,Touristy and needs a refresh,"Exhibits throughout the park could be better, and are 'aged'. If the city/county could spend a few dollars to revamp the park and museum it could have an influx of visitors. Are you listening LA?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WhiteCollarNomad44
50,Great Small Museum with History!!!,"On our trip to California over spring break 2013, I wanted to introduce my 16 year old daughter to one of my favorite places from when I was young - the La Brea Tar Pits. It was great showing her the historical significance of Los Angeles during the ice age and the excavated fossils in this intimate museum. Actually viewing the still active pits has always been fascinating to me. My daughter thought it was great (other reviews said teens found it boring - I guess it depends on how historical significance is presented to teens) even though it is a relatively quick visit being a small museum. The only challenge were the vast number of school groups of elementary students that poured in that we needed to navigate around, but for the 2 hours that we spent indoors and out, it wasn't a large problem. There is always a fond place in my heart for this museum and I'm glad even as I've grown older, it still fascinates me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tinah3
30,Interesting for the price,"It is a very small museum can be done in about an hour and a half. Price is reasonable. Parking easy to get to. We went with our 2 teenagers and they found it ""boring"" Be sure to watch the movie and the skit(hokie) or it is really had to get an understanding for what you are seeing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LoriR96
50,1st time to CA,"Page Museum was on our list of things to do in LA. It is very educational and interesting that such a thing occurred in what is now one of the largest cities! We got there right after they opened in the morning. They have a large parking area ($7 to park), which I believe filled up pretty quickly. I think the adult admission into the museum was $12.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LisaB932

10,What a hassle to deal with,"We wanted to visit this place, so after dealing with a lack of signs to locate it, a parking lot was located which wanted to charge us 10 dollars to park (not including admission). By that point, it wasn't worthwhile so we went elsewhere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HunerW
30,A good museum,"This was a good museum, more for the back-story than what you actually get to see. The movies that the show, and the skit really help put it all into perspective.

I have such a greater appreciation of the earth and our history visiting Page. Clean and bright and laid out with countless incredible creatures salvaged from the earth right where you stand. Besides the bones and skeletons there are learning videos to watch, workers behind glass sorting through found treasures, plenty of reading history and of course a gift shop. Well worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Michelle_Haley
40,Step back in time in Downtown L.A,"The Page Museum at the La Brea Tar Pits is only a small museum but if palaeontology is your thing then this is the place to visit.What is wonderful about the Page Museum is that what you see on display originated from right underneath the ground you a standing on. You can read the interesting story as to the discovery of the fossils and the men responsible for the dedication of the land to scientific research.Watch as scientists restore and reconstruct bones in what they call the goldfish bowl. A glass walled laboratory where you can observe them whilst they undertake the varying processes involved in recovering remains from animals such as the sabre tooth cat, deer, birds, reptiles and also shells, seed and plants remains.There are also interactive displays that provide an insight into what it would have felt like to be trapped in tar and try to escape.Walk around the grounds and you can still see the bubbling tar pits and current projects where they are digging up fossilised remains.You don't require a lot of time to visit the museum and tar pits but it is well worth a visit if you can spare the time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/missskybird

50,Lots Of History right In the Middle of the City,The Le Brea Tar Pits is conveniently located in the middle of the city and surrounded by many restaurants and shopping. parking is very easy and reasonably priced for a visit. Lots of schools were visiting when I was there but there is so much room it was never crowded. The excavations outside were easy to see and really show the bones that were trapped there long ago. The Museum inside is well laid out and nicely exhibited. The entire exhibition is a wonderful history lesson for both young and old. I really enjoyed it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MichaelBronx
50,One of the few museums that has its total focus on this era,"We were at the Page Museum twice; once in March 2006 and the other in March 2012. This place is considered to be a satellite branch of the main Natural History Museum (located in Exposition Park) and it has its main focus on the ice age and the periods of that era. The museum has history of the tar pits and there are many fossils and robotics of ice age mammals. Then there are the tar pits outside. We were delayed a bit from going outside the building because it was raining, but it eventually let up. The tar pits can be viewed for free and there are one excavation pit has a set of viewing windows where the fossils that have been located are marked with flagging (color of each flag varies depending on the animal). There is one pit that is currently in operation (gated off, only tents and some equipment are visible). This is an excellent place for anyone into natural history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trainfan01
40,Unique Los Angeles Attraction,"On Super Bowl Sunday, I visited the Page museum for the first time in over twenty-five years. i went with my boyfriend, who is from England and had never been to the Page.First, if you're not a football fan, make sure to get out of the house on Super Bowl Sunday, it is the least busy day in Los Angeles. Take advantage of it! We practically had the museum to ourselves, it was great.We arrived just minutes before the eleven o'clock docent guided tour. The tour takes place outside and includes the Pit 91 excavation site and the original Page museum, which the docent had to unlock to let us in.Our docent was Gustavo and he was fantastic. The tour is free and a must-do. We got so much info from it, that walking through the actual museum seemed repetitive. Don't get me wrong, the museum is great, but the tour was what we really enjoyed.The Page museum is small (about an hour to go through) but really well done with regard to mixing education and fun in a way that is good for both adults and children. It's also amazing to see what Los Angeles used to be.Parking was seven dollars in the back, a secure lot. In fact, we saw lots of security officers patrolling Hancock Park. It feels very safe.There are lots of good places to eat on Wilshire. We went to The Counter for Burgers, which was a two minute walk from the Page.It's a unique destination that should not be missed by tourists and locals alike.Please visit my blog for tons of pictures and a more extensive review of our Super Bowl Sunday exploits!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KarenH644
50,Fascinating. I couldn't tear myself away for hours.,A most amazing resource of prehistory right in the middle of LA. I would count this on-going discovery as a must-see for anyone with even the mildest interest in natural history/archaeology.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/buckup2000
50,Fun in the City,I really enjoyed the tar pits and Page museum. The displays were very realistic and the history was portrayed in an artful manner. There is a very pretty park area to walk to get to the excavation sites. The fossil identifying area with working archeologists was very interesting. There were places on the lawn that tar just bubbled up from the ground. A worthwhile destination in L.A.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SabinaM843
50,Loved it!,"I didn't know much of anything about the La Brea Tar Pits but thought I would check them out. We went into the museum first (which is free for active duty military and teachers!). The museum is not that large and depending how much you want to read can be done in about 30 minutes to an hour. They have fossils of many extinct animals that I did not even know existed (saber tooth tigers, mammoths, and giant sloths). It talks all about the area and how the animals came to be found in the tar pits as well and what they have learned about the animals and the area by the fossils. The windows where the people were working were really cool since you can see them working to clean and sort new fossils. After the museum we walked around the park which is free and open to the public. There are multiple tar pits around the grounds and you can still see the tar bubbling in some of the pits. One of the coolest parts though was the viewing station at the active dig sites. They have marked the fossils with flags to show what they are currently trying to excavate from the pits. If you like history this is a great place to check out and only took 2 hours to see almost everything so it could be done much quicker if you just wanted an overview.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChristenH790
40,Wonderful natural site in mid-city,"The history and practice of archaeology at the La Brea Tar pits is extremely interesting. It's very easy to get to by car, and a visit is well worthwhile. We visited before lunch on a Thursday and the parking lot had plenty of room in it. We're glad we stopped there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/captdoc41
30,It was ok,I was a little dissapointing. I was expecting a lot more. The tar pits are nothing to see that we could tell. The grounds are nice & the museum was clean & clutter free. Not sure it is worth a second trip.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KonaLover09
50,"Strong odor, interesting exhibits","Located in a very busy part of sprawling LA this site offers a spectacular display of how these natural tar pits became the graveyard for so many species as they were drawn to them. The ongoing search of these pits by skilled professionals and students has resulted in the finding of numerous fossils that are on display. A visitor will also have the opportunity to view the ongoing research and discovery first hand as the tarpits are actively ""mined"" for their contents.The grounds include several tar pits as they were thousands of years ago. They are aromatic, not in a pleasent sense, but certainly bearable.This is a worthwhile experience and unique in its presentation..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RogerM965
30,Drive by it,"All you need to do, is take a drive past and you will see all the needed sights. you can walk into the park, but there is not much to see. Young boys might like it do to the dinosaur history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tourist803758

50,Have been going here for years,I remember having a field trip here when I was little. I went back again as an adult and it brought back so many memories. I'm not usually a museum person but I enjoyed the family environment and it was neat looking at the exhibits again. I don't know if I'll go back but it was fun to revisit again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmieL301
50,"Tar pits are free, museum extra.","There's just something really cool about the tar pits. They smell. There's cheesy woolly mammoths displays all over the place, best of all it's free. The museum is around seven bucks and worth checking out, but if your just looking a free place to kill an hour, this is a great place to go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Matthew0027
40,Some Lessons in Bio-Diversity ...........Page Museum of LA,"Page Museum of Los Angeles at La Brea Tar Pits is a revelation for us. Those who were born in the 20th century and who don't have any idea of the earth's evolution or those mammals who roamed the earth and now have gone extinct. These animal and birds have gone maybe due to man's own making..his pursuit of more land for development. Maybe, the environment has changed...smaller area for forests...disappearing plant food to nurture these mammals. The scientists may have the answers but one thing is definite. Many plant and animal species have disappeared over time and the museum exhibits is a monument to these breeds that have gone. The Museum are divided into many halls. There are also educational movies that would last for 10 or 15 minutes that are quite entertaining if one is interested in earth science. The fossilized life forms of the birds and the mammals that roamed the earth thousand of years ago are found in all parts of the museum. You can also purchase some earth mementos from their souvenir shops before the exit at quite reasonable prices. One thing that I remember though is the pungent odor of the tar pits which assaults the senses upon entry into the compound. For the kids, the museum holds a lot of treasures of history and lessons to be learned for earth conservation and protection of the endangered species of animals, birds and plants.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KIMI4812
30,family museum,the kids love this museum and they have good exhibits. It just needs to have newer or updated exhibits so we can go more than once a year or every two years,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/famfavtravels
50,Extremely educational,"Even though I am not overly interested in old bones and extinct animals, I really enjoyed this place. The walking tour was great. I very knowledgeable guide with answers to all of the questions. Page museum, though small, was also a great experience. All ages from children in stroller to senior citizens in walkers were in the audience. Well worth a few hours of your time, and priced very reasonable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnE633
50,We really enjoyed it,"We went to the Page Museum over the holidays with the family. It was a great experience for all ages. Tons of exhibits, lots of information and friendly staff to answer questions. We coupled this with a trip over to the Shuttle Endeavor at the Calif Science Center (about 20 minutes away) and had a wonderful day. If you are at the Page around lunch time, you can go across the street to The Counter and have a great burger as well!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/socal13
50,To stand on the land ......,"I flew to LA on business and had time to go to the Page Museum and check out the Tar Pits. You don't have to pay to go into the park (25 acres), so you can check out the Tar Pits for free if you wanted too. The museum holds displays of animals that have been taken out of the tar pits in the park. It only cost $12 for adults. I found it amazing to stand on the land that great creatures stood at one time. I also took the tour of the tar pits, it's about 45 mins long and well wroth it. You could probably join the tour for free because they meet outside by the flag pole and never asked to see my Museum ticket. I also got a thrill out of sticking my finger in one of many spots that was oozing tar and brought some tar home on a piece of paper :) I enjoyed hanging out in the park while waiting on my ride.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LundyLune
50,Great for young and old,"If you like fossils, this is the place to go. Hard to believe until you see it, how many fossils they have found in the middle of major metropolis. They are NOT dinosaur fossils, but more recent extinct animal like saber tooth tigers and mammoths. Fascinating.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travellingdoc50
50,Small but worth the trip,"Took my 7 year old son and he loved it. Take the free half hour tour of the outside tar pits and park that meets out front at flag pole, you don't need a museum ticket to join. Great info on the tar pits. The museum has great memories for me because my dad would take me. My son likes all of the bone displays as well as the area where you try to pull up handles that are in tar. He also liked the items in the gift shop. Make time to walk around the park and take pics with the statues of saber tooth cats, sloths and the tar pits. If you walk around the park you will see tar oozing up in little pools in the grass. We even saw Liev Schreiber with his kids while we were there. Parking lot is behind the museum and costs $7, it was full at 1pm when we left but plenty of spaces at 10:30 when we arrived. Overall a must see while in Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SD-Traveler-CA
50,Great for kids and adults,"Park area is free and you can marvel at the oozing, gassy asphalt coming out of the ground and view excavation pits. A small garden replicates the natural vegetation of the times when this was an area teeming with prehistoric animals (but not the dinosaurs) Museum was not expensive and seems quite small at first but we easily filled in a fascinating 3 hours. Guided talks, av shows and a live performance about the saber tooth cat were all very worthwhile. If your kids have seen any of the Ice Age movies, they'll relate to the mammoths, sloths and saber tooth cats on display.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CeeB_13
50,Very interesting,"Natural events coupled with modern art, all in one venue. A full day is needed to view the artifacts, the art, take in the park, marvel at the tar's movement and examine the fine structures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HappyFamilyNow
40,Liquid Asphalt,"We found this place to tell a very interesting story about LA, thousands of years ago. It was very cool to see a working tar pit. The Page Museum really helps to explain all that you see outside near the pits. If you like science or history, you shouldn't miss this on a visit to LA. The ""fishbowl"" inside the museum lets you see working scientists. A January visit almost ensures that the crowds will be very light - I recommend it! But any time you get to go here, you should take advantage.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Foxl18
40,"A fun, quick stop",I had no idea these were even here. Very interesting for a quick stop as you're making your way are LA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoeB797
50,Fun for all ages,"A wonderful museum, not only for kids, but adults too! So much to see and experience inside, as well as observing the pits outside, with the replica mammoths, and nice seated area to relax in the sun while navigating around LACMA and the Page Museum.The gift shop is also lovely, with toys and books, as well as little fossils, (I bought an amazing sabre tooth lion replica!) and other very unique items. Added to this, the friendly and very knowledgeable staff make this a must see.It can easily be visited along with LACMA, but it will be a long day! Bring a picnic to enjoy outside, or dine at one of the on site food places.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RhiRa
30,Okay one time. But noting to bring me back.,"It was cool to see all this the first time, but there is nothing here to bring me back again and again. But if it's your first visiting to LA, it's a great place to stop by when hitting up musum row. Just a few steps from LACMA, it's filled with thousands of cool ice age bones and artifacts, all of which give you a pretty good idea of what it must have been like around here not too long ago. Lots of really long sharp teeth trying to bite you -- things haven't changed that much it seems.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/618PeterH618

40,Right Smack in the Middle of the Street,"To our left is the SAG building, to our right is where Notorious BIG was shot & killed and in front of us is a pre-historic tar pit just bubbling up tar. Definitely a break from the glitz & glamour of L.A. into something educational.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AllyBeeds
50,Interesting place to visit,"Among the prehistoric species associated with the La Brea Tar Pits are mammoths, dire wolves, short-faced bears, ground sloths, and the state fossil of California, the saber-toothed cat, Smilodon fatalis. Only one human has ever been found, a partial skeleton of the La Brea Woman[14] dated to approximately 10,000 calendar years (~9,000 radiocarbon years) who was 17 to 25 years old at death, and found associated with remains of a domestic dog, and so was interpreted to have been ceremonially interred. John C. Merriam of the University of California led much of the early work in identifying species in the early 20th century.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OctavioA_13

50,Really Interesting,"I really enjoyed this museum. It was shocking to see the history that is being dug up from the tar pits.Animals that have been extinct for thousands of years were trapped in the asphalt that bubbles up in the area. You can still see asphalt seeping up. The museum has several exhibits that teach visitors about the history and creatures that were involved in the tar.It is surprising that this kind of treasure is in L.A., but it is definitely worth the time to visit. The exhibits, skeletons and information is very interesting and enlightening. I couldn't believe how big some of the animals were that were trapped...it speaks for the power of the asphalt. The gardens are also beautiful and are worth a tour.If you can, go right when they open...I went on a Sunday but arrived shortly after they opened the doors, and it was a little crowded. Despite the people, I'm glad I went.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JaxonB_13
50,Best-kept secret in L. A!,"We discovered the Tarpits by word of mouth from an old friend & took our grandchildren there as a break from Disneyland. Well, what a great place!! Fascinating displays, marvellous gardens with amazing models of mammoths etc. We were all completely delighted , and so surprised to find such a museum in down-town LA. Who would think tar is that interesting, The history of the area is great, & a really welcome change from Disneyland, even just for a day. We hired a car & drive from Anaheim..a bit scary for Aussies , but all went well. It was hard to find a tour going to the Tarpits other than the double-decker bus tour starting in LA. , & public transport was totally hopeless.A must-see in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Glenysneedham

40,Fossils and Geology in the Middle of LA!,"I suspect that a lot of people walk or drive by the La Brea Tar Pits - maybe take a look over the fence - and think they've seen it all. Slow down! This is more than a place where some animals got stuck in the asphalt. It's a geological time capsule unlocking some of the mysteries of the past. The Page Museum is the repository and education center that houses thousands of fossils, a number of outstanding exhibits, and explanations of the area's history. Adults and kids of all ages will love it, especially the animatronic re-creations of extinct and exotic creatures. Guided tours are available and the friendly staff roams around answering questions. A continuously running short film provides a well done summary of the history of La Brea Ranch and fossil excavations. On site parking is very convenient and affordable. If you're in the area, this is a worthwhile attraction, especially if combined with a visit to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/billw191
50,"Excellent, educational, and entertaining step back in time",This museum was lots of fun to visit. The displays were informative and beautiful. There was a quick film that gave an overview of the tar pits and the museum. And there were scientists at work sifting through materials to find bones and other items of interest. Staff wandered around answering questions to ensure that visitors get the most out of the experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/daphdog
50,Awesome!,"Always wanted to visit this place. Finally got the chance. Not what I thought (better), based on that movie ""Encino Man"" (LOL, sorry..).I am always interested in CA and LA history, this has lots of both. Everyone should visit the Tar Pits (Brea is Spanish for tar pit). Check it out!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SledMan
50,"Kinda creepy, but cool","This museum about the tar pits is awesome. You see the videos on how and why there are so many bones in this area. Many of the displays are animated, all have placards for reading, really well done. An announcement of a docent tour provided us much more information and the guide answered all of our group's questions. The docents are awesome! Many discounts for admission, just ask. Next to LACMA, go see the boulder and kelp spaghetti while you are there. Can eat at LACMA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeffBransford

50,Great museum and grounds for quick visit,"This place was cool, and one my children (boys 10-15) really enjoyed to my pleasant surprise. The museum is just the right size, not too big or small, and had a great gift shop. Lots of work in progress to you can see if what they have extracted from the pits. The pits themselves are not all that interesting to look at, but it is amazing to think that this stuff is right near downtown LA now.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrt77
50,A Step into History,"We made a quick stop on our way back from Disneyland on a whim, because our 4 year old son loves dinosaurs and other prehistoric animals. I've got to say I was really surprised at how much we liked this museum. The museum itself has wonderful detailed exhibits about the animals that roamed the area in prehistoric times, as well as the history of the area and how the museum came to be. My son loved the life-sized saber tooth tiger, woolly mammoths, and giant sloth. He was able to hold a fossilized saber tooth tiger skull and teeth with the docent, who was wonderfully enthusiastic, informative, and patient. The museum has an atrium in the center with a pond and lush greenery. The pond has several turtles in it, which my son discovered. Outside, we walked to the active tar pit and watched the technicians carefully reaching into the muck and cataloging new remains. All-in-all the museum has something for everyone. The adults will learn a lot, and the kids will both learn and be able to run around on some incredible grounds. I am amazed that such a gem exists right in the middle of L.A.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dmresource

50,Liked it more than I thought I would.,I was actually surprised by how much I enjoyed visiting the La Brea Tar Pits and Page Museum. It was decidely thought provoking to stand in central LA at naturally forming tar pits - just odd. It REALLY makes you realize how much LA has changed over the years. (to say the least!). The Page Museum had great displays of the skeletons they've removed from the tar pits and little videos showing how the animals were trapped. All very interesting. Great place for kids too as they've set it up to provide them with places to run and explore. Highly recommended.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mathyew
30,Trip to the Ice Age,"The world famous La Brea Tar Pits, is the worlds biggest Ice Age excavation! Ice age fossils are not as sexy as dinosaurs fossils because they are very new, but they are very interesting no the less. The Museum as far smaller than I thought it would be, but If I wasnt so tired I may have enjoyed it more. Its got a great collection of Ice age fossils including Wollys, Saber tooth cats, and dire wolves. If you like an educational experience its a good place to spend a few hours in LA. Plus the art museum is right next door too! They also give free tours of the grounds and your bound to learn something new and interesting!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hidai
50,One of the best places to visit in Los Angeles,"I came here when my kids were little; but they have kids of their own now, so I thought I would take a walk through alone. It was even more fascinating than it was in the past. The exhibits and the view areas to see professionals working on the bones retrieved from the tar pits are experiences one does not have in many museums. Just the thought that these artifacts are from a few fett away is astounding. There is so much to learn at the Page. Parking can be a challenge; but it is worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MonaOrangeCountyCA

I think little boys would LOVE the museum, and pretty cool to see all the bones they have found in those pits.I would recommend this museum for sure!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KQQ
50,Fascinating place,"The Page Museum @ the LaBrea Tarpits is one of the most interesting museums I've ever visited. Apparently there is a lot of oil under the ground in this part of Los Angeles; tar slowly oozes out of the ground and there are orange traffic cones placed around theses spots so no one walks into the tar. Who knew..... The musuem is full of skeletons of animals that were caught in the tar; it sounds creepy but is really fascinating. Back in the day dust and leaves and rainwater would cover the tar; an animal would walk onto the tar or stop for a drink, get caught in the tar and then the animal would be attacked by wolves and then the wolves would get caught in the tar and slowly sink.... Thousands of skeletons were dredged out but they only exhibit a few hundred. One of the more memorable exhibits is a steel rod that is plunged into a barrel of tar; you can pull the rod out and experience how it feels to be trapped in the stuff. This museum is right next to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and it is easy to get to via public transportation. This museum isn't that big in size but it really impresses.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/beachormond

Prehistoric bones are found here each day with archeological fins ongoing as I write this review.The smell os this tar puts you in the right mood to go into the museum a few steps away. Fascinating place with many areas to explore. A full 3 hours plus is needed. Make this museum a must when coming to Los Angeles.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/564barbaraw564
50,"Camels in California, Really?","This was a fascinating experience on many levels not the least of which is that the tar pits sit in the middle of the city! Yes there were camels in CA. at one time as well as numerous other animals that we never knew existed in our fair state.The grounds are well kept and interspersed with tar pits around the property, some quite large and others only a few feet in diameter.The museum is well laid out and very informative with life size replicas of many of the mammals that were found in the tar pits. Possibly the most fascinating part of the museum is the opportunity to view through large windows the paleontologists at work on various findings from the pits.Overall a great experience, our only regret is that we did not have our grand children with us, they would have loved it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BabyBoomerNorCal
40,Great collection and exhibits of dinosaur era and beyond,"The exhibits here are unique in that they have many animals that got caught in the tar pits, and how other animals used the tar pits as a buffet.The exhibits are well put together and are great for discussion about prey and predator and different time periods.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pweiss
50,8th Wonder of the World,"I don't know why it isn't more famous. It's absolutely fascinating. From the tar bubbling up randomly in the grass to the big pit to the museum, it's just awesome standing in a pre-historic goldmine.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BurbankLisa
50,Saber-tooth cats and wooly mammoths!,"We visited the La Brea Tar Pits and the Page Museum with our grandchildren, aged 7 and 10. They took an interest in every aspect, and came home to draw their interpretations of all the animals. It is a unique and fascinating place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JBS64
50,What an asset!,"I first saw this site in 1981 and have always wanted to return, and it was as good as I had remembered. No, better. Anyone who loves paleontology and history, and wants to show the kids that the earth is a lot older than 9,000 years, here's your opportunity! And if you see Charley Cox playing his guitar or banjo out front, tell him hello from North Carolina, and drop some bills in his box.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/763JimS
30,Quick trip to La Brea Tar Pits,"Was in the L.A area, and decided to stop into and see the tar pits. The area is pretty chained off, but it was cool to see the oil slick ontop of the surface water. Some bubbles of Methane came up too!Didn't really have a chance to see much of the Page Museum there, but they had an assortment of animal skeletons retrieved from the tar pits. Ranging from sabretooth tigers to elephants and some other extinct animals.Would recommend this place to individuals seeking a family day as they have picnic areas and I'm sure the kids would love a place like this.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlbertaEdmontonGuy
40,Very educational and interesting spot.,"Tar pits weren't entirely interesting to look at but the museum was very well designed and the information was captivating. My children truly enjoyed the timeline display, the working lab, and the dire wolf skull!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gunnarinc
40,"The subject of a 4th grade book review, became a reality!","This is one of those places I have wanted to see after learning about it when I was about 9 or 10 years old. Not the easiest place to get to via bus, but doable depending on where you are at. The exhibits and pits are wonderful. The grounds are also a nice place to lounge around...too bad there isn't much in the way of picnic provisions to be had in the general area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HolaGatitos
30,I expected a lot more,"I was disappointed. It could be that my expectations were too high, but I didn't feel like there was as much to see as I had hoped. Perhaps it wa the time of year I went, but the tar wasn't bubbling much and I just felt let down. The museum was very nice, just not very large. It would be a good place to take children, as a learning experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sharondE1443BF
50,Ice Age Fun,"I go here with my kids (ages 9 and 11) several times a year and have since they were itty bitty. The museum doesn't change much, but the kids love it. One display has you try to pull your way out of the tar. There's a case of dire wolf skulls found at the Tar Pits. There are two good films. Plan to spend about an hour and a half exploring.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/teachkindy
50,The best tourist site in all of Los Angeles,"A bold statement, I know. But I've been coming here since I was a kid on school field trips, and it never fails to amaze me. The idea of saber-tooth tigers running along on Wilshire Blvd never fails to put Los Angeles in perspective.True, the little film is the same one I saw in kindergarten, but it's still informative.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EydneW
50,Very cool museum!,"The Page Museum(Tar Pits) is a great way to experience what it was like in the Ice Age!Make sure you get in on a tour with Ashley as she was very knowledgeable and entertaining!The grounds are beautiful with the different little areas seeping tar and the big ,enclosed tar pit is the coolest!The tour inside the museum is great and you learn all about the animals that used to get stuck in the tar and how it happened.The lab is very interesting enabling you to see the scientists working on actual projects!I would highly recommend visiting the Page Museum as well as The Museum of Natural History!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GailF175
40,A must see in LA if you are interested in history.,Gives LA a little more dimension than entertainment and interesting for those who like geology and seismic aspects of LA.Looked after in a way that highlights understanding and imagination about the area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KathleenT171
40,Nice place to see fossils and tar!,"The museum itself has a few nice pieces from the pits that they dug up over there. I will say that the museum itself is a bit small, but it doesn't mean it is not significant. Very interesting place. You can also see a few ""pits"" where there is the methane bubbling through the tar. You also can see a pit that they are actively working on finding fossils.All in all, a super place to visit. You should do so if you're in the area!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gizbab
30,Fun in the tar,"This is a great place to go and look at what life was like millions of years ago. I am not a particular dinosaur fan however I found the tar pits very interesting. They are fun to see, not an all day thing, maybe a hour. I had to stop by here on my way through Los Angeles",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KenF411
40,Been wanting to see this since I was a child...,The interpretive info in the museum along with a stroll thru the grounds to see the tar pits satisfied a long-standing curiosity.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Abigai1
40,Interesting glimpse into history,"Unique, so worth a trip. We wish you could see the staff working the current pit that is being excavated.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/longandshortofit
40,Interesting,"The La Brea Tar Pits is an interesting tour. It's amazing to see both the number and variety of animals that were trapped in the tar pits.The tour is good and quite informative. The museum itself is interesting and full of cool fossils and artifacts.If you get time on a visit to LA, I'd suggest a visit to the Tar Pits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sask_Rider_Fan_001
50,Didn't Want to Go,"After a full day of sight seeing in the LA area, I was ready to head back to Orange County to our hotel. I told the other guys that I'd wait in the car or hang out somewhere. It just didn't sound interesting to me. Since I don't really like to be a ""downer"", I relented and went along. I would have really missed a significant experience if I had not gone.I was amazed at the whole concept and the types of animals whose skeletons had been found in the tar pits. There were animals that I had never seen evidence of inhabiting this continent.I will remember this visit forever. Don't miss it. It's not what it sound like.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/frankhamil
40,Dire wolves and Sabre toothed Tigers,"A great place for kids,wonderful displays that are interactive and educational.Allow at least 2 hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/teffic
50,Educational and fascinating,"Wife went on the silly Hollywood tour and we went to theater pits.spent about two hours there ,could have spent more.Fantastic",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/steverA8718SU
40,Worth a visit,"Good, rather than very good but really worth a visit. Interesting facts, good displays, a little expensive but glad that I visited.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TriciaBY
50,Who would have thought?,"Amazing fossils in the middle of LA, The world's richest source of Ice Age remains and it's right in the middle of a city. I found it fascinating and the talk given by the young researchers with their animatronic, lifelike sabre tooth was not to be missed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dreamers45
40,"Interesting, but a lot of little irritations added up","We visited on an October Saturday. Parking on weekends is a flat $7 fee. Parking spaces are SMALL, and we had difficulty finding a spot because at least 2 larger vehicles were parked such that they used up 2 spaces.We walked up the nearest set of steps, only to find that we were in an atrium and needed to walk down the other side to reach the entrance - more helpful signage to find the front door would have been appreciated.The entrance fee was $12 per adult. The museum has several interesting exhibits and a short film that was very informative. You can watch scientists cleaning up and labeling fossils in the Fishbowl Lab.We left the museum and walked around the park. Pit 91 was open for viewing, but in October, the scientists are not working, so that was disappointing.My recommendations - go early in the day to make parking easier and earlier in the season, when they are actively working in Pit 91.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/smm628
50,L.A. Tar Pits,"I studied geology, but that is not enough. I also grew up 40 miles from here, and always wanted to go there. This is a cool place. It is all about ancient bones stuck in tar/oil in the middle of downtown Los Angeles...but it is real! Sabre toothed cats, Ancient elephant-like creatures, etc...just no dinosaurs....nice exhibits, parking is ok, just get there early.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DantheMountainMan
50,Fossil wonderland in the midst of a metropolis!,"I have wanted to visit the La Brea Tar Pits since I read about them as a child. The images of Ice Age animals being trapped forever is the oozing asphalt have stuck in my memory for many decades. I have been to Los Angeles on numerous occasions, but have never before made the time to visit them. In addition to several visible tar pits (well-fenced!), there is also one in which actual excavation was being done.Near the pits themselves is the fascinating museum/laboratory complex called the Page Museum, with a number of reconstructed skeletons of creatures from 12,000-40,000 years old. To me, the most impressive specimen was that of a Columbian mammoth, which was much larger than the more common Wooly mammoth. This specimen stood about 13 feet tall!There was also a ""fishbowl laboratory,"" where you could observe, through a glass wall, paleontologists and volunteers actually working on the fossils from the pit. They are in the process of preparing another mammoth skeleton, with tusks ten feet in length.I imagine that the area is quite warm in the summertime, but on the lovely October day of my visit, it was a balmy 75 degrees (F) and very pleasant. Admission charge is moderate, I think, and well worth it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maestrolms
40,Handicap Accessibility Issue,"This was our third trip over the years to the museum, but our ninety year old aunt's first. We parked in the museum parking lot in the rear of the museum off S. Curson Ave. From there, it's a 500 ft walk to the front entrance! Although compliant with the letter of the ADA law, the distance is still formidable for the elderly and quickly made for a less than enjoyable visit. A drop off point closer to the entrance is needed.We love the museum itself and revel at the precision and detailed work that scientists and volunteers have done here. The short movie available inside the museum is an excellent synopsis of why the tar pits exist and what has been done to extricate the vast fossil record that exists here.It's a great place to take kids, but don't come with any elderly relatives unless you borrow a wheelchair for them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VEC24
50,I went to LA to see the Tar Pits!!,"OK, not really but since I was there for a convention, #1 on my list was to see this and it did NOT disappoint! There is nowhere else in the world where this happened and it is right here in the US. The asphalt still just bubbles up at random all over the grounds and there is still so much to dig out and uncover. The museum is cool and quiet with a few outdated stuffed animals but the bones of those who came from the grounds is IMPRESSIVE! TAKE THE TOUR....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lola22259
50,Must see! Don't miss this! Saber tooth cats in central LA!,A gem in central LA. I can't believe these saber tooth cats and mammoths are buried under LA. Incredible place to see bubbling tar pits and real working archeological digs. So many fully preserved skeletons. Wonderful experience. Kids loved it and didn't want to leave.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShonaL703
50,Treasure in my own back yard,"I can't believe it took me 6 years to come to this museum. It is right in my neighborhood. The grounds are terrific, but the museum itself is Awesome! Some of the films and exhibits are a little cartoonish, but that is to engage youngsters. This is a place for everyone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kknew
50,Thousands of Very Cool Fossils,The approach to this museum will take you near a bubbling pit of tar from which thousands of fossils continue to be recovered. This place is way to cool to see in an hour better two or three as there are actually two museums here and plenty of things to see on the grounds,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AUSDNVR
40,Great Outing for Kids,Just like jumping back to the Ice Age. A great display of prehistoric animals taken from the actual tar pits around the museum itself. The whole area seems like a real Disney set not a made up fake version,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RockwallTraveler
50,Old relics in a modern city,"There is a mixture of oil and methane forming a tar pit from which prehistoric relics of animals regularly appear. The museum is very interesting with films to watch and a gift shop. It is like a mini natural history museum! Not expensive, disabled friendly and knowledgeable staff. Well worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/simsey57
40,Who knew,It is a very interesting place to visit. I enjoyed learning about the history of how the tar pits came to be located in Los Angeles. It isn't the most exciting place to visit. I don't think my teenagers would enjoy it. The only negative thing is the smell. You can smell the tar from far away.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JenShake
50,Great,"I love history and geography this is a great place to learn how the Earth works and over time how it has changed. You feel bad for all the animals that have perished because of getting stuck in the tar. Even the woman they found, not that im sick but would of been nice to see her on display like all the animals. Although not alot about her is said, just a small pic of how she may have looked and what tribe she belonged too. Looking into pit 91 is crazy how deep that pit is and that they are still finding animals in it.Lots of kids about the day we went which is good to see, that even though its summer holidays they are still learning about the earth and that we need to respect it.I have to wonder there are small closed off sections of the park where tar is starting to come throught the grass, im i right in thinking in many years time there may not be a Page Museum?? Its goin to be swallowed up by the tar too??But amazing day out even if your learning.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SiobhanB560
40,Cool but not amazing,There is a lot of cool stuff here but the exibits seem kind of run down and forgotten. All in all it is worth a visit but dont have too high of expectations.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jefft771
50,LA's secret tourist attraction,"Only found this place via a friend and when we attempted to travel there very few people knew of it. The place is simply amazing . So interesting we had a group of ten,visiting from Australia ranging from 5yrs to 65yrs and every one of us found it fascinating. We went for a 1hr 30 min visit which was way to short. Highly recommend this very exciting educational and interesting attraction. Also not expensive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gaipaula
50,Smelly but nice!,It really tells a tale just by looking at the pits of what it was like in this area many years ago!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Markate47
40,prehistory,The tar pits are unique in the world. This is a place that we like to bring visitors to LA. We start with a walk around the grounds to see the natural tar coming out of the ground and then visit the museum with exhibits. The short movies are well worth watching.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MargieLA
50,Awesome,I loved the museum and tar pits!! They are so interesting. The museum houses most of the specimens found in the tar pits. It's amazing to see how many they have found in just one spot. My husband and I were so enthrall ex by everything that we ended up spending 3 1/2 hours between looking at the dig sites and actually going to the museum. The staff there was also fantastic. They all seemed to really enjoy their job.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sdnocnzo
50,"Very worthwhile, learned loads","Student discount was available and appreciated.The displays were very well laid-out with plenty of information, which made for a very educational trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SR441
50,Tar Pits in downtown LA?,This was fascinating to visit the tar pits. Working archaeologists were there to answer your questions. It was amazing to see such large animals so well preserved. This is a must see for those visiting LA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/doloresc295
50,Very educational,"I really love the exhibits of educational information that they have there, and what the children can learn there. I really love the La Brea Tar Pits outside and how people young and old are drawn to that outdoor exhibit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChristinaR240
40,The Tar Pits are way cool,"Didn't actually stop at the Page museum, but I'm not sure you need to. The active tar pits are very cool, and there's a lot of free stuff outside to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J20009
50,Interesting,The museum itself wasn't that interactive but was quite interesting to learn the history of the area and then be able to walk around and explore the tar pits outside. We also got in free as it was the first tuesday of the month.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/singmummy1
40,Animals of the past,Excellent displays.I have visited there off and on since the 1950's! Still wonderful.Pay for parking is easier than trying to find a place on the street. Be sure to take a camera.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CalArtGal
40,Highly interesting,I'd heard about the tar pits so this was my chance to visit. I really enjoyed the visit- some great exhibits and displays. You can see the remains of the various creatures that stumbled into the asphalt all those years ago! You can see into the glass walled work room where workers sort or clean the finds. You can see the various workmoutsbwhich have been examined.A really good place to gain an insight into 'ancient' LA!!! Recommended!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DW111
40,"Wow ... this place is ... look out, there's a tar pit!!","I never this place existed, until my L.A. based girlfriend drove me here. I have never seen anything like it ... there's a real tar pit here, and it is huge, and extremely dangerous/fatal. I thought the only drama in L.A. was safely contained in movie studios. Boy, was I wrong. Someone tell the squirrels to look out for the big lake with steam coming out of it that will snuff them out, should they come into contact with it. Geesh!Very fascinating place, complete with areas where you can visit the excavation sites where scientists dig up the remains of sabre toothed tigers and mastodons that fell victim to the tar pits, thousands of years ago.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CityP
50,Very Interesting,Tap pits right in the middle of the city. And active digs and research being conducted while you watch. See the bones dug up and watch the methane gas bubble up through the tar.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ed60062
40,Fascinating for the family,Tar pits smack dab in middle of LA! Terrific museum with a working lab and excavations on site. The tar is literally oozing in spots on the manicured lawns of the property. Highly recommend becoming a member to then visit the Natural History Museum for free. Plus it's tax deductible and supports the arts.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/188isabellec
50,You don't see tar pits every day of the week...so go!,"There are tar pits in the middle of Los Angeles? This is a great spot for kids and for adults who are still curious about the world. Thousands of fossils have been pulled out of these pits over the years, so check out the museum. If you don't have time for that, the big pit features a heart-rending tableau of a pre-historic elephant caught in the tar. You can also view the pit that is an active dig. Very interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Regi184

50,"Super fun, fast, informational museum!","My 7 y.o. son and I visited Page Museum and had a wonderful time! The outdoor tar pits are neat! It's just so amazing that they're still there. The museum inside is just right - not too much, not too little. We had fun watching the short movie, playing with the tar buckets, seeing all of the wonderful exhibits (the wall of wolf skulls is UNREAL), etc. Everyone there was super helpful. We enjoyed seeing the working lab with all of those cool bones and the people so dedicated to restoring them. Great stuff! Can't wait to return and explore some more!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/flossboss
30,the infamous tar pits,some people say the adjacent tar pits are more entertaining than LACMA but obviously those people are lacking in aesthetic or artistic appreciation of sorts that being said the tar pits are a fascinating place to learn about los angeles' prehistoric historical roots and dinosaur past shedding some light on why they have odd sculptures of dinosaurs strewn around LA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlobalGoneLocal
40,Worth the visit,A lot of people will have heard of the tar pits but few have had the opportunity to enjoy them. The tar pits are quite interesting but it is a visit to the museum which will be most informative and put your experience into perspective,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlenA856
50,Great little inexpensive museum,We thought this place was great. Really interesting displays and child friendly. Watching the people at work in the lab was a really nice touch. Gave a good insight into the history of the area and the pits themselves. Well worth a visit!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Markybritt

50,A Worthwhile Excursion,"I've always had an interest in visiting the Tar Pits since I first read about them as a child. We were in the Los Angeles area so I made it a priority to find the museum. It was definitely worth the effort. The entry fee was reasonable, the museum was amazing and the displays were a walk in history. I was also surprised to see that it is still an active archeology dig. I highly recommend a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GuyontheGo55
50,Great museum and grounds,Very kid-friendly museum and attraction that adults will enjoy as well. Many forget that one of the economic engines that helped fuel the growth of Los Angeles was oil -- the tar pits are definitely part of that history...and of course going many years beyond that with the incredibly preserved bones of unlucky animals that became mired in the tar. You should budget 1 to 2 hours for the museum -- the grounds are beautiful and a good location for a picnic as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanR375
30,Just ok.,"My husband took our 7 year old daughter there while I went to Paramount Studios with our older daughter. He said the museum is not that great, very few things to see. And the tar pits look like puddles of dirty water. It was a big let down.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Olivefamily09
50,Better than expected!,"We visited on a weekday morning and it was not busy. We had the place to ourselves which is unusual in L.A. The demonstrations, displays, videos and exterior grounds were all incredibly interesting. Credit should be given to all those associated with this facility for their research.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Valleyboy27
50,The tar pit worth seeing.,Great combo of indoor and outdoor exhibits. Parking was adequate for getting around with rental car. Well marked exhibits and very educational overall.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/448michaelr
30,"very small, but unique","it's a small museum, can do it in 1 hour or so. It is cool to see the smelly tar and what is dug out of it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maychang
50,We planned our trip around this and LA County museum,"What a great day to spend here and at the LA County museum. The tarpits are just something you don't get to see everyday. And for my son, who is into science and dinosaurs, this was like everything in real life. A small museum, but the surrounding tar pits take a lot of time to explore and is extremely interesting to old and young alike. Just a wealth of preserved bones and information on the history of this unusual geological site.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CrankyPantz
50,Good for quadriplegic with kids!,Very accessible for wheelchairs. The kids who are 8 and 10 enjoyed it and it was air-conditioned which helped because it was a hot day. It took us about 2 hours minimum to tour.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alb388
50,A really great museum! Very educational and beautifully put together.,I visited the tar pits sometime in the mid-70s as a kid and it stuck in my mind as a cool place. For some reason I have never had the opportunity to get back there until now (to take our 7 year old). I have to say.....it's come a LONG LONG way from the funny little chain-link bubbly pit of the 70s! The museum itself is gorgeous...the assembled skeletons are wonderful...as is the wall of wolf skulls...and the boards of information on the animals found in the pits was fascinating to me. We watched a couple different movies about the excavation and paleontology. My son particularly enjoyed being able to look down into the pit that is currently being excavated (where you could see bones that are sticking out of the ashphalt). Parking is easy...$8 to park and then $2 refunded when you get your ticket stamped in the museum. And the super bonus for us was that our local Natural History museum is part of a cooperative membership program which got us in free with our membership card. HIGHLY recommend.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ClawMarks
50,Fascinating!,I had gone as a kid and recently brought my own kids to see this cool place. We were not disappointed! Great exhibits and videos. The pits are still being excavated and you can watch scientists at work!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dooglos
50,Fossils Make Science Come Alive,"We were visiting theme parks in Southern California and decided to stop at La Brea Tar Pits one afternoon. Wow! What an impressive place.We started out with a free tour of the tar pits directly in front of the museum. The guide was very knowledgeable and took us to a site where they've actually been digging fossils out of the tar. The park is really well maintained with native plants, rolling, grassy hills and trees to climb.The Page Museum makes science come alive. We gazed in awe at the skeletons of ground sloths, ancient camels, dire wolves, various birds and gigantic mammoths. It's a bit surreal to think that these animals were trapped in the oozing tar hundreds of thousands of years ago! In the middle of the museum is a Fish Bowl Laboratory where visitors can watch scientists clean and restore fossils. They also have realistic scenes of animals in 3-D, like the one of a saber-toothed cat attacking a giant sloth. Very cool!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fun2travel68
50,Dire wolves are real!,"Everyone made fun of me for wanting to go to the La Brea Tar Pits even though I'm an adult, but I absolutely loved it. You can wander around the grounds for free, look at the tar pits and the excavation sites, and you can pay to go into the Page Museum and see not just bones and dioramas and a saber tooth cat attacking a giant sloth (rrawrrr!) but scientists at work -- they've glassed off the lab so you can watch people cleaning bones and piecing skeletons together and stuff. And I made pressed pennies with dire wolves on them for all my friends who watch ""Game of Thrones"" because dire wolves are actual prehistoric creatures! In the museum is a whole wall with over 400 dire wolf skulls, which pretty much boggles my mind.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/edwardsmom24
40,Sculptures - really impressive,It really got a lot better and nicer over the past few years.It really is educational for children.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Munki888
50,Fun and Educational for children,"I went here as a kid, and now this month I brought mine to see it. It's amazing to learn Sabre-tooth cats and wooly mammoths did roam in the LA basin thousands of years ago in a cooler, wetter climate. Outside, you can see the tar seep and the gas bubbles.There is ample parking in the rear; I think morning at opening is the best time between 10AM to 12pm. With validation, you will receive a $2 refund; be sure to ask for the $2 from the parking attendant when you drive to the exit gate.Plan on about 2 hours to see everything.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vegasbuffet
50,So Interesting,"We spent about an hour and 1/2 visiting. We have two boys (10 and 8) and they were completely engaged. It is truly amazing that this exists in the middle of LA. Since there is a small fee to enter (free for teachers), it was not too crowded, even though we visited over a weekend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Amoral
50,Interesting and Informative,This museum was great. I enjoyed learning about how the animals were trapped in the tar and the excavation process. Be sure to take the free walking tour.Tip: Military and Teachers get in Free,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/educator26
50,interesting,"this was fun and educational and interesting, the museum was really thorough and it was neat to see the actual pits and to learn what tar REALLY is!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarjorieH748
50,must see in Los Angeles,"A good way to spend some time --- interesting, informative and educational. Hard to comprehend that something like tar pits could be found within city limits. On the spur of the moment (we were close to closing time), we went into the Page Museum. We do not regret going inside. Its hard to phantom just exactly what was pulled out of the pits. A must see!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PeterR942
40,An attraction worth the trip,"I have been in love with paleontology, natural history, etc. since I was a kid. I have been wanting to visit this museum from the time I knew it existed. Upon parking, you see the Page Museum from the back side--it appears as a large earthen berm with a square structure on top. As you approach, you can see down into the the courtyard garden, which features some of the region's fossil plants. There is also a koi pond and a bunch of turtles. We walked around to the front entrance, which leads you down into the berm, feeling like you are going underground to explore. It is a nice design touch. The entrance fee is $11, once paid, you have full access to the museum's fossil displays, hand's-on demonstrations, and courtyard garden. There is a viewing area where you can watch the scientists working on the fossils. They have a marker board with interesting facts and information about what fossils they are currently working on. Outside the museum is like a park setting. You can walk around the various tar pits and see scientists and volunteers working in whichever pit is the current active dig. Pretty cool stuff. Also, quite surreal to see the tall buildings nearby when you are looking at ancient fossils.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeslieS830
50,Fantastic,"Fascinated to see the tar seeping up through the grassed area outside the museum and also the tar pits fenced off but open for you to see where they are currently digging and how they do it with explanations of what they have already found and flags of what they still have to dig. Inside the museum amazing to see fossils that had been dug up. Exhibits of saber-toothed tiger, giant jahgular skeleton, columbian mammoth, american mastodon (elephant) and many more. Most interesting to see the paleontology laboratory where one qualified staff member works along with volunteers working on different things. There is a notice board telling you what they are working on - painstaking work involved. Something quite different to what we had ever seen previously.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/591SueW
50,Worth the visit,I was pleasantly surprised at this excellent museum and the quality and quantity of exhibits on display. Great place to look at the depth of time in the prehistoric world.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WayneT175
40,Time travel right in the heart of Los Angeles,"This Museum is beautifully and imaginatively presented and well worth a visit.In the distant past animals were entrapped here in pools of tarry substance bubbling to the surface, and perished along with other predators which tried to attack them, seeing them helpless.Their bones sank down to be preserved in these tar pits, and for the last hundred years or so, have been excavated and many have been painstakingly reassembled as complete skeletons (mammoths, sabretoothed cats etc) and are now displayed in lifelike scenes.You will be able to see archaeologists and assistants at work sifting and cleaning material in the workshop, and visit the excavation sites.The Page Museum is situated in an attractive park area with several other tar pits, where work is currently going on.It is amazing to think that right here amid the traffic and the city buzz, we can see the actual remains of animals that roamed this spot in past ages.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JasmineC616
50,Very good,We visited the tar pits and the museum. It was very educational and the fossil collection is huge. It cost approx $21 a person. You can visit the pits without paying that though. Just walk to the left and follow the paw prints to the pits.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/howelldw
50,Great day trip,The tar pits were a great place to visit during our trip to L.A. We spent a few hours touring the pits and the Page Museum. The displays were very interesting and even our teenagers enjoyed the visit. You can see everything in a couple of hours then have the rest of the day for something else. Traffic can be rough getting there though.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VARetiredAF
40,interesting,"who would guess - in the middle of LA..worth the trip, plus you are cloe to many other attractions and make it part of your day",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnnetteH951

50,An excellent way to spend a sunny afternoon.,"I headed across to the tarpits when I visted The Petersen Museum. It was very interesting and informative walking around the park and finding out about how the dinosaurs were uncovered, and how they are still finding fossils. Make sure your go on a sunny day, and don't forget to pack a picnic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BR4DW77
30,You Have to Really Like Fossils,"And other creatures from this era to appreciate the museum. There are no dinosaurs, contrary to what you might think, but enough fossils & bones from animals from the 35,000 years ago. The museum is a full city block of grounds (with active tar pit excavations) with generally no waiting for tickets. The museum includes 2 movies, active outside tar pit digs as well as an ope ""fishbowl"" fossil preservation area. Numerous fossils hung in the display cases recreated the story of the tar pits.Visit last about 2 hours and parking (on site) may be difficult to find. No food, but stroller friendly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/238mw
50,Pungent smell of tar . . .,adds an air of authenticity to the LaBrea Tarpits. We did not go into the Museum due to time constraints but really enjoyed the Pits and animals on display. What an interesting place in the middle of busy L.A.!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/susanbeach11

40,Really cool museum,"Really enjoyed the museum, lots of displays of fossils. Lots of things to look at and lots of information. Great if you have kids who likes/loves dinosaurs. It was $11 for adults and $9 for kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nevyntoo
50,Very Educaional,After ten years of traveling to southern California we finally decided to check out the tar pits.The museum was extremely informative. They have a large pan of tar with plungers. By pulling them up you could see how difficult it was for the animals to get out. It was amazing how tough it was. It was well worth the price.We all enjoyed seeing all of the skeletons. There is still gas bubbling up through the tar pits so be prepared for a strong smell. It was well worth the price.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/blgs
50,Great museum!,Came here several times over the years for school tours. Great exhibits with great tour guides. The kids will LOVE it!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/305HeatherM

50,Fascinating for All Ages,"Excellent films throughout, great that you can see scientists actually working. Kids couldn't get enough of the animatronic dino and the ever bubbling pits outside.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mizlilinola
40,Paleontology up close and personal,"Page Museum and the La Brea Tar Pits are a must see if you are interested in paleontology. The number of fossils is just staggering. The Page Museum is well maintained and large enough to display and exhibit the various fossils but still small enough to not overwhelm you.The videos they presented were well done as well. But the big star of the show for me was the actual tar pits on the surrounding grounds. It is awesome to be able to see paleontology in the various settings in an urban setting.There is paid parking available behind the museum, which is important since this is in an urban setting. For me the only downside was the opinionated commentary from the guide where he stated his opinion as fact. Two obvious examples were his diatribe on man man global warming while glossing right over the extreme climate changes in La Brea before man.The second is his equating micro-evolution (fact) with The Theory of Evolution (theory). Please present the facts as facts and theories as theories. In addition, some of his comments about DNA were laughable, but were taken as fact by most of the audience.If you can visit, please do set aside to watch the paleontologists as work. You want watch them ""process"" the recovered fossils. If you are lucky, you can even see them excavating fossils from the tar pits.If you have very young children (toddlers or infants), you will probably want to wait a few years to visit.The Los Angeles County Museum of Art is adjacent, so you want visit both museums in the same day without even moving your car.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Steve61Florida
40,on the road to beverley hills,"we caught the express bus from downtown LA which only costs $1:50 for the 30 minute bus ride plus 5 minute walk back from the nearest bus stop. not what we expected but an educational visit of less than an hour. we didn't visit the museum as felt it was too expensive rather wandered around the grounds. At one pit there is a viewing window where an actual Archiologist, really nice guy who has a wealth of knowldge and can explain it to dummies, who hadsworked at the tar pit answered questions which was fascinating as what hollywood portrays in not what actually happened. well worth the stop if you're travelling to beverley hills or further.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thelooks
40,More and less than you might expect,"Yes, the tar pits are there. Yes, they have a lot of explanation of what they have found there. Yes, they have fascinating skeletal remains, fanciful artwork of animals struggling for existence, and clear presentations of the eras and periods of change over thousands of years. Yes, you can see them at work discovering and recovering the bones of long-gone species of animals in this area of North America. Yes, it is educational.No, there were no dinasaurs. No, they don't track the details of the development of man.This could be a two hour walk around or a two month study. I wish we had more time to look into what is going on here. As a tourist attraction it is strictly hit and run. If interested, buy a book and read all about it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/680gayl
50,Great Place... to bad it's in LA and traffic always sucks...,We loved this place. Tons of stuff for the kids to look at and do. We also loved walking across the street and eating at the street vendors. One of them had the best fries we have ever had... and we've had a lot of fries in our lives. Don't forget to get your parking validated...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChrisC576
40,Unique place to visit in LA,"While visiting LA, I took my wife and 7 year old son to the tar pits and museum. It is a unique venue with a large tar pit. There are cones through out the park where tar has seeped to the surface. What other major world city has anything like this?The Page Museum is affordable and worth the time to see assembled skeletons excavated from pits around the park. There is a good film that explains how animals were trapped in the tar and preyed upon. They also have an exhibit where you try to move a piston through tar to show how just a little tar can trap an animal.The Farmers Market is near by and worth a visit too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trusted-advice-1
40,A great history lesson,"The La Brea Tar Pits are a classic attraction in Los Angeles and with good reason. You really get an interesting feel for our natural history and for what a huge city was like before there were buildings, traffic, and even people. Fascinating exhibits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Valleyblue
40,I still remember the tar pits!,"The first time I saw the tar pits was 30 years ago! The image of the mammoth stuck in the pit, and the smell of the tar ""stuck with me!"" I really enjoyed this place. I think to many of us have got used to the almighty commercial world of entertainment. If you enjoy science or the wonders of nature, check out the tar pits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dovernj
40,"Fun, informative, nice open area, but it does smell like farts","The tour is very informative and does provide an interesting background into the local area of Le Brea. I used to run to this park quite often when i was in the area, and i like it a lot. But like my title states, unfortunately, it does smell of sulfur quite strongly from the gas rising to surface here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/beman25
50,I truly thought it was wonderful. This great place in the middle of the city. Wow,Loved it the specimens were outstanding and the museum was great,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/foxyladyrcute
40,Interesting info,"I have always wanted to visit this site. I wouldn't say it was as exciting as I was hoping for, but I did enjoy the tar pits and the museum had some pretty interesting artifacts in it. I think the history of it was fascinating and even my 12 year old liked it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dknippenberg
50,"Read about it as a kid, finely got to see the real thing!",Great museum. Wonderful artifacts. The movie is an award winner. The museum shop is fun. Great to see the dig sites and to see the places where so many fossils have been found. The saber-toothed cat is exceptional as are the wolly mammoths and the dire wolves.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/918michaelr918
50,Very interesting right in downtown Hollywood,"We went on the first Tuesday of the month, where the museums are free. There is tar (asphalt) bubbling up all over the park like grounds! We enjoyed the exhibits; they are not dinosaurs, but ice age creatures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/simva3
40,Intriguing Look into the Past,"While this attraction may not be as flashy as most of Los Angeles' offerings are, the Page Museum offers visitors a glimpse into the extreme past of the Southern California landscape. A working archeological site, the visitor is given the opportunity to see scientists and volunteers at work unearthing the bones of various species that lived on the land during the time of the large land mammals. The still active tar deposits bubble constantly, giving the visitors the sense of what the place smelled and looked like in this ancient time. There is a small museum store that offers beautiful jewlery for the discriminating patron, as well as hats, tshirts, and toys for young and old. If you're in the area, this is a great place to learn about Southern California before it was Hollywood!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rokclmr
20,Only if you have dinosaur addicts in the family,I think this is not worth the detour and certainly not worth the outrageous entrance fee. OK if you have a kid that is positively fixated on dinos. Otherwise you can give this a pass.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anadamansea
50,Wow!,I really enjoy museums of natural history and the Page Museum is perhaps one of the finest I've ever seen. I found it amazing that so much life was lost to the tar pits. That and the fact that they are still actively finding more all the time. The number of sabre tooth cats alone is beyond my ability to comprehend.What immediately strikes you strange is that the Museum with the tar pits is smack in the middle of town. The town grew up around the tar pits and your senses kind of refuse to believe that the tar pits should even be there.I can only imagine what it must have been like to have been there back in the day so to speak. No doubt I would have been hiding behind a big rock out of sight.If you enjoy natural history this is one museum that has to be high on your list.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AJL117
40,Good for kids,Very interesting to see. Love the wooly mamoths in the lake outside.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tipsy252
50,Very interesting -- for adults and kids,Very educational as well as interesting. I thought I was fairly well-informed on this area of pre-history and found I learned quite a bit -- and in a very entertaining and interesting manner.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amysnewyork
50,"Go, you'll learn something!","There were prehistoric horses, camels, and lions in America ... who knew?! Sabre tooth cats, long horned bison, mastadons, and mammoths ... wow! No dinosaurs though, they were extinct something like 65 million years before the tar pits were formed ... I guess they,sort of, are the tar pits! You're guaranteed to learn something very interesting! If you're in the West LA area and have an hour our two, go!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MassCouple2
40,"Mammoths and sabre toothed tigers and teensy tiny mice, oh my!","As a child there were three things I knew about California: Disneyland, Hollywood and the tar pits! In my young brain they were some fantastic place where animals were swallowed by black goo (which turned out to be pretty much so the truth... sort of!). When I found myself living in along the Central Coast, on my first trip to Los Angeles I made time to investigate, for myself, what the tar pits are all about. I've been back twice since with friends and family - this place is one of a kind.The Page museum is small-ish, but the building architecture is interesting. Even more amazing when you find out (from the movie in the museum) that the archives are kept in those walls. Excellent collection of animals retrieved from the tar pits - and an observation window to watch bone cleaning in action. Honestly, the museum keeps my kids' attention for a bit - then we head outside to Pit 91, the active dig site to see just how they do what they do.Pit 91 is cool - even though I've never observed actual digging on any of my three visits. You can see down into the pit through the window of an observation room. Walk around Pit 91 and see the boxes of dirt saved from the construction of a nearby parking deck - the site was known to contain bones, so the solution was to literally cut blocks of earth and box it up, to be excavated at a later date. On our most recent visit, there was a woman working in one of the boxes who let my kids touch an actual bone, still covered with tar. Pretty nifty!Also, there are several pits of tar (pond-like) to see around the park area - and sometimes goo in the grass!Park in the Page lot for $7, or - and this is what we do - park at a meter and put about 1.5 hours worth of money into it.FREE for active duty military and family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SusanB997
30,Only visit this place when you hav run out of options,"This place is interesting, but I don't think it is a must-go attraction. Do park on the side of the streets if you want to save some money. The visit to the tar pit for me was about an hour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tada888
50,A great place to learn about history and relax,"I have never thought much about this park albeit, I always drive by. I went to the La Brea Tar Pits and got to explore its wonderful Page Museum in which you can learn about pre-historic Los Angeles. And I was surprised what a reach cultural and archeological heritage we are surrounded by. The museum and lagoon are part of a park complex right next to the Los Angeles County Museum of Arts (LACMA) in the Miracle Mile area of Los Angeles. You can do the museum and excavation pits (which are open to the public for viewing and you can actually see some fossilized animals buried in tar) and then just enjoy the park. I'd suggest you do the Page museum first, have lunch at one of the eateries there (two choice - one fancy and the other a coffee shop with great options) or you may get food from other restaurants on Wilshire Blvd right next door. You can enjoy the shade of the mature trees and then if you have some energy and time left, go to LACMA. You'll be impressed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hernanusa
40,More interesting than you'd think!,"I didn't really want to go here but my hubby did. The museum is actually interesting though, with a movie that explains the area and what happened there without being too long or boring. The exhibits are cool, especially when they show how many wolf skulls they found and the part where you can see actualy people working with real fossils in the ""fishbowl' lab!The museum is in a park which is free, and which is also pretty and interesting on its own. In case you do not want to pay for the museum, it's still a cool place to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vikileigh
50,"WOW, Wow, wow!","It was interesting to get to as we used our Yahoo Map directions to get there. YOU MUST HAVE CASH TO PARK! Nine dollars, but you get two back on departure with a validated ticket. If you find a place on the street, you can wander the grounds for free. It is $11 per adult to get into the museum, but it was well worth it as the displays are just great. Fully reconstructed Mastadon, Horse, Sabertooth Cat, Dire Wolf and more. The exhibits are interesting and arranged in a logical way. Do NOT go expecting to see Dinosaurs as there were none when the tar pits evolved. When you think about it, it is the extinct dinosaurs and their jungles which actually made the tar pits. There are guided tours, but the grounds have enough explanation if you do not want to wait. We arrived about one in the afternoon and stayed to close at five. Saw the entire museum, movies, toured the grounds and found the pits are still active, the Lake Pit is still bubbling gas and asphalt! There are active asphalt areas on the grounds as well as the other pits. Little kids will love the bones and big kids will like the history. It met all my expectations and I have been wanting to see this place for almost 40 years!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravellingAZTeacher
40,Very interesting & worth the visit!,"Finally, after many visits to the LA area, I finally had a chance to check out the Le Brea Tar Pits & museum. Very interesting & worth the $12. Neat that you can watch them finding bones & cleaning finds right in front of you! Lots of history in a very small area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GBCheesehead
40,Interesting and fun,"The Page Museum is an interesting and fun look back at the prehistory of Los Angeles. Great exhibits on the animals and birds that lived here in the past, and the work being done to recover the bones of these animals from the tar pits. I enjoyed walking around the park, gardens, and the tar pit itself. Next to the LA County Museum of Art, this is a great stop, especially in the morning.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/texasrepublichistory
40,This is a neat place,"My 6 year old was not into it as much as I thought he would be, but my hubby and I really enjoyed it.

40,Interesting!,Spent a couple of hours at the musuem and it was much more interesting than I had originally thought. My husband had always wanted to go and we finally did it and it was excellent. The displays are so well done but my favorite part was going to the tar pit sites and seeing the excvacations being done in front of us.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tafuti
50,That lovely tar!,"Educational, nostalgic and a fun afternoon. Had no idea there were so many wolves in Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KeC742
50,Travel back in time,Saw the tar pits many years ago before there was a museum. The Museum is very well done - lots of fossils and lots on interesting displays. Statues of animals in pits fun to see as was the area where there is still digging being done. Well worth the visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeeDubes
50,Fascinating History of Extinct Mammals in the US,We really enjoyed our visit here! So much information on the natural history of extinct mammals in the US! Who knew the pronghorn developed his current speed to outrun the extinct American cheetah! Truly fascinating!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FunKelly
30,Small semi-interesting museum.,"It was actually a nice day to go to the tar pits, although a little heat does make the smell a little bit more infectious. It's definitely a very educational museum, but it is also very small. Besides two 10-minute films and the fish bowl lab, it's not very interactive though. The atrium is really nice and I'm not sure if it was just the day or not but some of the things were closed for visiting the tar pits. That was my favorite part as a kid so I was a little disappointed. However, it's not too bad, it's 8 bucks for students, 11 for adults. It shows a lot of animals killing each other though so not sure how great it would be for really little kids. But I definitely think it's great education, especially a good supplement if they're learning that stuff in school.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dearjamie26
40,An Educational and Beautiful Visit,"The museum is a beautiful piece of architecture and inside the gardens and displays are calming and educational. Some of it is specifically designed for kids, but there are plenty of things for the parents. The gift shop was terrific and I found a lot of special items of interest for Christmas gifts.The tar pits are just jaw-dropping. I first visited them in 1956 on a field trip with my second grade class and was hooked. Then there pits were boarded up and all you could do was stand over a hole in the ground that smelled like oil. Now you can see the dinosaur sculptures in the tar, and see the active bubbling of the tar from the super-heated vents below the pits. To be able to stand and watch over a spot that is filled with actual dinosaur bones, knowing that where you stand was once where dinosaurs and saber tooth tigers roamed is worth the time and that it's free makes it an absolutely ""to do"" thing in LA. Parking is not plentiful and requires you walk from wherever you find a spot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BritFrenchPol
50,Incredibly Interesting,"I went here expecting nothing, and I was surprised. It was incredible to have such a piece of history located near the heart of LA. Pay for the tour, it's worth every penny and enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PatrickM896
40,Interesting and different,Not the biggest or the best but exhibits you wont find anywhere else.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TimPas
50,Went to Tar Pits kicking and screaming,"Thought the Tar Pits would be boring but when i got there I was fascinated by the Methane gas escaping and bubbling up in the the Tar Pits. Went to the Page Museum and saw the fossils that have been found in the tar pits of ancient animals that lived in the area up to 10,000 years ago when they disappeared from the landscape. Enjoyed my hour there after all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JAB596
50,L.A. History,I remember coming here as kid and standing on the side watching for hours. Today there is the Page Museum which explains the history and worth the small fee. As life evolves my kids now have gone on the same field trip to stare at the tar pit in wonder and eat from their sack lunch.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ElaineIrvine
50,Well worth it. This will fascinate and entertain you.,An amazing exhibit of fossilised and preserved animals and bones from the tar pits. The museum cost eleven dollars for a single adult which was very reasonable. The displays are terrific and informative. There is a short video presentation which sets the scene well. Be sure to take the time to walk through the grounds to see the various spots where tar is still bubbling up from deep below and admire the various statues of prehistoric animals that have been placed there. The souvenir shop is well stocked with lots of interesting and reasonably priced items.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stavanger85
40,Sticky Black Goo,OK. We never quite got to the Page Museum because we spent so long at LACMA but we did wander the Tar Pits. My favorite was finding spots in the grass where the tar oozes up to the surface. It was a small child's dream of a mess!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gac620
50,Educational,"I spent an hour or so at the museum and the surrounding grounds. The museum was hosting 3-4 elementary age school tours at the time, so that proved to be crowded and I had to wait, or double back to see different exhibits. The displays were impressive and I enjoyed the 'fishbowl' type setup of the employees working on different projects. I learned quite a bit of the Tar pits and the history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Brad208
30,Expensive for the time it takes to go through.,It's an ok museum but seeing the tar pits from outside for free is better value.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AuntyJoy

50,Excellent museum and place to visit,We went on the first Tuesday of the Month. It is free admission on this day. The museum is on one floor and details the finds from the tar pits. You can see the people working on identifying the items dug up in the pits. On the grounds you can view an open dig and see fossils in the tar. Bring a stick to prod the tar around the grounds. It was a nice day and we all had a good time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/colbyr844
40,Fun for little kids who like dinosaurs,Small and managable museum. The grounds around it are really nice.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jill914
50,Great,This was a great place to walk around and learn about the Tar Pits and the animals that were stuck in the pits many many years ago. Great watching the actual people cleaning and making the exhibits.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FruitLoops42
40,Page Museum,It was raining so we only went to the Museum. It was fascinating. Watching the volunteers cleaning the bones and then seeing the finished skeleton was memorable,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jocelynw205
40,Amazing!,I was really looking forward to this visit and it didn't disappoint.The whole story behind the tar pits is so interesting and all the displays are great. Very interesting and well worth the visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BeachHSD
40,la brea tar pit,lovely educational museum a bit small but lots of interest about the annimals found in the pits wel constructed from the bones found and still finding tour guide went on a bit unfortunatly but you can also do our own thing,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Denis421
50,Great museum,"Our group (all adults in our thirties) visited this museum about three years ago and I still remember it as being a great time. The exhibits both indoors and outdoors were very interesting, and the outdoor gardens are beautiful. We spent several hours just walking around and taking photos. We were on foot (visiting LA and did not rent a car) and there are other attractions within walking distance such as LACMA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ksquarednyc
40,Science at work,"At this museum, you can not only view exhibits but can watch archeologists at work painstakingly assembling skeletons of fossilized remains found in the tar pits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KathyLongBeach
10,We couldn't go due to no parking,The day we were going to go and we checked the their website the day before and the day off there was no mention of filming that day and how half their parking would not be there. They had streets blocked off and no one could seem to tell us where we could park. We drove all the way from Vegas and didn't get to see anything there. They really need to update their website and warn visitors if there is no parking. I am handicapped and can not walk 5 miles away to park and then walk the park and then walk 5 miles back to the car.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobynH284
50,La Brea Tar Pits,"It's been a long time since I've been, but i've never forgotten and I would like to go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GT357
50,"Saber Cats, Mammoths & Tar!","Love this place for the abundance and proximity of all the skeletons. The wall with all the skulls, the tar seeping through the lawn and the ongoing excavations all add to the experience.A good area for pick-nicks and close to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) and easy to see both in the same day, eat lunch between and not feel rushed.Offers free days monthly too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bentheredunthat
40,Interesting Attraction,The La Brea Tar Pits are really interesting. The displays are great. It would be a fun place for kids aged 5 and up. It's not too big so you can do the whole thing in a couple of hours. Great gift shop.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ceelie
50,Superb window to the Past!,My Son's totally enjoyed seeing the Bones of ancient animals of the past!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jlmajestic
40,Great place,"We went on their ""free"" Tuesday, so even with parking, it was totally worth it! My kids love going here, which is great, because so do I. We took my nephew and he just ran thru it all, so this trip was done real quick-like. We did get to watch a movie and look at Pit 91, which we hadn't done before). So cool to see actual digging being done. My kids also LOVE the sloth statues that they can climb on. I think my kids' favorite part though, and it looks like all the other kids' favorite part, is rolling down the grass hill outside! As long as they don't roll into hiding tar puddles!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KnTnEnN
50,The coolest place for Ice Age fossils,"OK, what kid wouldn't want to see this? It's a museum right in the middle of a city, surrounded by a lake of asphalt, in which scientists are digging up sabre-tooth tigers and giant mammoths. There is nothing like it elsewhere in the world. You can watch them work on the bones, and walk among the excavations.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traveler2542b
40,Very interesting,Got off to a very good start when we entered the museum to be informed it was free (we visited on a Tuesday). The introductory video was really interesting explaining the history of the area. Little Puddle (12) enjoyed the exhibits and we were all impressed with the Mammoth and Sabre Tooth Tiger fossils.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/puddletink
50,Great Experience!,"Although traffic to get there was hidious, it was worth it. The Page Museum is spendy but what an experience! You can watch the scientists meticulously picking apart the pit finds inside a 'fishbowl' kind of lab. Tour the pit sites on the grounds and poke a stick into the small fenced sites throughout the park where tar bubbles up. The observation pit was unfortunatly chained shut.All in all, a great outting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FrozenAlaska
50,There is something so cool about bones sticking up out of tar,"At one point in the 1970s sidewalks around the Page Museum caught on fire. Look for tar seeping up through cracks in the sidewalk as you walk to the museum. Make sure you visit the dig where you see bones sticking up. DO NOT tell your kids they'll be sucked into the little bits of tar on the grass. That's just mean. My experience is that adults like this better than kids, but we love the history and the excavations.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lois2272
30,"Outdoor grounds are nice for walking, too","The museum is always good, and very very interesting. Try to go outside around the back and talk to some of the docents who are near the Pit diggin areas.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MoBe
50,Rainy Day Outing,This was a last minute side trip by dad on a rainy day in L.A. Highly recommend going through the Page Museum and then walking the pathways to see the tar pits. The reluctant family turned out really enjoying the history and current excavation projects going on.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jmzrmac
30,A lot less than I expected,Very small and not worth the price of admission. Certainly not worth the 30 minute drive to get there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/georgebH8943MB
10,Tourist Trap,"What a waste of time and money. The grounds outside were pretty but the museum was very small, the mechanical exhibits old and outdated, and not worth the admission price. It was boring. Nothing like the Academy of Natural Sciences in Phila. or Museum of Natural History in Washington. Save your money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/denjolu
50,Very interesting place!,"Right in Hollywood, great museum. I would go again. You can see the Tar Pits and the scientists digging in the holes surrounding the grounds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VacationerSeattle

40,Is there a bottom to this pit?,Always a pleasure walking through the La Brea Tar Pits. One learns much about the animals in our past and witness how they became trapped in the Tar Pits. Children of all ages will enjoy this museum.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1momo1
40,Prehistory in the Heart of LA,Right in the heart of LA you can stroll around a still active tar pit that trapped animals thousands of years ago and turned them into fossils. Be careful walking across the lawn since tar is still bubbling up where you least expect it. The museum holds fascinating displays of animal fossils -- sometimes dozens of the same kind. It's an easy place for all ages to get an education about things that stretch from the past into the present. And it's so bizarre to have it right smack in the middle of a busy city!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RyanLChicago
30,It's tar!,It's not exciting as it sounds but how exciting can a natural tar pit be? It's tar. Not much to look at but sinking sculptures in tar. Cool that it's ancient and still there. Not sure it's worth paying any admission; it's tar! In the summer you see it melt.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/orangeyellowdog
50,Very interesting museum,"The Page Museum has changed a lot since we first went there many years ago. Housed in this very nice, clean building, surrounded by a lovely park, is an excellent collection of fossils representative of the prehistoric creatures that inhabited the area and were trapped in the tar pits. One can watch museum staff at work on fossils, see a short movie about the area and the tar pits, and visit their nice little gift shop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DayCaptain
40,"All bones, no meat ;-)","Beautiful gardens, check out the bubbling ooze before you enter the museum. On display is an amazing selection of complete skeletons of mammoths, sabre tooth cats, camels, elephants. Really a worthwhile exhibit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tqmbill
40,A great venue for children,I went to this museum as a kid and had the best time there with my school group. All the tours were educational and the docents were very kind and informative.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cdeenen_canada
40,kids loved it.,"I would definitely take the free tour that is ongoing daily. Went with my kids, they had fun. They have all sorts of different displays of animals excavated from the la break tar pits. You could also see the tar pits still bubbling (very cool).Definitely a place to visit if your in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StanleyG935
40,Pleasantly surprised,"True, the building is very dated and some of the exhibits are looking a little worn, but 2 things made this a great place: the outside tar pits where some work is being done are awesome, and one of the museum staffers inside is great - I don't have his name, and can't be sure he's still there, but look for a big guy in a lab coat (maybe an actual scientist or grad student), with long hair, tattoos and earrings. Not kidding with the description, and he was great. He's one of those people who can make learning fun, a naturally gifted teacher. He had a large group of kids and adults enthralled and excited by what he was talking about.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/254SusanC
50,la brea tar pits Page museum,Show bones that have been excavated from the area. Over 6000 different species including wooly mammoth and many more.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LoriS22
40,Very cool and educational nice park,Did not do museum but grounds were very nice worth a look if in neighborhood$11 for adult to c museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IBBETSY_11
30,"So-So, Too Expensive","The museum is okay, definitely not great. The displays are an older style, but it was nice because it wasn't overwhelming. Being able to watch people clean off and extract bones in the fishbowl is best part of the museum. Children from touring school groups take away from the experience because it's not fun to have a bunch of kids yelling, screaming, butting in, etc. The viewing area of the tar pits is not very good and they aren't currently digging in the tar pit because they've been busy cataloging and inventorying fossils collected from the construction of another building on the site. Parking was $9, then you get a $2 refund when you leave as long as the museum stamps your parking ticket when you purchase a $11 ticket for the museum. Also, in order to get your $2 back when you leave you have to make sure to stop because there aren't any signs or roadblocks on the way out. The $18-20 price tag is not worth the experience. I was disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ValueT_11
40,small but good museum,While at the LACMA I decided to check this out next door. Totally worth it. Very interesting and kid friendly.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carry_0n_traveler
50,A Surprise for all!,"This was a great surprise. Not really knowing what to expect, we went to the La Brea Tar Pits and were more than happy with the choice of that day. The museum was sensational; the films were interesting; the information of the bodies found in the tar pits which had been preserved for thousands of years was fascinating. We spent a day here and could have revisited the following days to find out more. So interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MCRAD16
50,Fun place to visit,"Great place to visit with kids. Well-informed staff, interesting exhibits. You can even see how our knowledge of the Ice Age has improved by comparing the newer exhibits with the older ones. The kids found that a wonderful learning experience. You can park across the street, on a side street, for $2; no need to waste money on the official parking. Nearby, Black Cat bakery had excellent coffee and good pastries. We didn't stop for the pancakes, but they looked good, too. The shop has fine looking bread. If you go on Yelp, you'll see their lunch food gets mixed reviews, so maybe some caution other than coffee and pastries or bread.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bayarddc
40,Interesting Park,My Dad and I walked around the park as the museum was closed when we got there. You can view the tar pit at the front of the park and read the placards describing what was found there. Its a nice open park to walk around it. I probably would include the museum on my next visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ostrowskicp
50,The California You Never Knew Existed,Tar Pits - Here in California! I would never have guess that these were part of the ancient landscape! And the animals that were trapped and preserved there - amazing!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amercorp
40,Informative and very interesting.,the museum was well lit and clean! I felt they could have taken the plastic 5 gallon buckets from the digs. I felt it detracted from the real curiosity of it. Apparently when they are done or side tracked they leave the buckets stuck in the mud there.. my son enjoyed a perk of being a Marine.ACTIVE MILITARY GET IN FREEOver all it was a nice day because i was with my son.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brandicoy
40,Cool Museum,"This museum is so cool Bring the kids. Educational, entertaining, beautifully produced.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Erdabus
50,Great experience taking you back in time in the evolution of species,"The ""La Brea tar pits"" is a fascinating place, right in the middle of a huge and modern city, taking you 40.000 years back in time, when there the American mastodon was still around. The museum is located along Wilshire Boulevard, not far away from the LACMA and the Petersen Automotive museum, and when you get closer to the area you will notice that odd smell of tar in the air. Basically this is a huge tar pit where in the late 19th century they found remains of animals which got as many as 650 species, such as bison, camel, condor, coyote, dire wolf, ground sloth, horse, mammoth, smilodon etc. who got trapped in the sticky tar and sucked into the ground, and other animals, such as tigers tried to get a bite of them and also got stuck, and so on. The museum is great for any age and kids love it and spend hours there. This is a modern museum where, organized in a pedagogical way that makes it fun and interesting. In the area there are still ongoing excavations for public access, and that is why I have visited the museum many times, just to see the progress from one time to the next.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mietzner
50,Excellent museum,This is an excellent museum with nice grounds. You can spend as much time as you like here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cadigirl
40,Prehistoric in the Heart of Los Angeles,It was a great place for kids and adults alike. Particularly interesting was watching some of the technicians clean bone fragments recovered from the tar pits. It's not Hollywood but it gives you a very good idea of what LA was like before it became tinsel town.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lovetogoLosAngeles
40,Cool Historical Site,"Very neat to see. Museum was cool to see all the fossils they have unearthed so far. Never saw a sabre tooth tiger before. Also has an area where you can watch volunteers unearth more bones from tar/earth casts. Cost is 1/2 price within last 30 minutes of operating hours. Park down the street and it is free for 2 hours. Enough time to see museum and walk the grounds. Walk around all the pits to see the water pit still bubbling, the escavation pit in opeation, and also just the other pits they still have to show. Neat. Grounds are very well kept and pleasant to sit, relax or have a picnic. Take some photos and have a nice time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DG-Texas-123
50,Great for families!,"If you have children, this is an excellent stop in Los Angeles! I grew up listening to Johnny Carson talk about it, so I was interested in taking my daughter when we visited. She is 8 years old, and she loved it! From the actual tarpits to the paleontologists working behind the glass...she found everything about it interesting! And we all learned something! Highly recommend!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kellymattei
50,"a fascinating piece of history, a must see!","it was amazing to see a tar pit in the middle of a huge city like LA. i was fascinated by the methane bubbles! the property was well maintained. The museum was fascinating, a bit dated, but the tour guide was well informed and let us know which displays had inaccurate information. I guess paleontology is an evolving science! I felt like a kid again seeing the assembled skeletons of huge prehisotric sloths, camels, bisson, and wooly mammoths!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StevenMiamiFL
40,Interesting museum to see,We had about 2 hours to kill before heading to the airport. It was an interesting place to visit to see the various fossils found in the tar pits.

50,You'll learn much about the past!,The La Brea Tar Pits are a must see! The short films provide the background needed to view the exhibits with more understanding. Loved the glass observation room where you can see volunteers actually doing the work. Interesting skeleton displays of extinct animals. Not your usual museum. Some displays are animated. You'll get a different sense of very distant times in Los Angeles.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/49ehc

30,Very cool place to visit.,Not big on old bones but really neat things to learn. The musuem was nice but the tour was a must do. You can visit the Tar Pits without paying for the musuem but you don't get the benefit of a educated tour guide.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FriendlyFords

50,Le Brea tar pits,"fantastic museum, great to see the animals from 60000 years agowould definetley worth the visitthe gift shop was great valuelots of different things to see",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kelvinf52
30,Good but don't expect too much,"The first thing you'll see when you walk in is a sign saying:""There are no dinosaurs in the displays."" That's a good warning so that children don't risk being disappointed when they come nose-to-nose with a saber-tooth cat instead of Apatosaurus. Indeed, the tar-preserved animals and plants at La Brea date back to the Pleistocene (40-11,000 years ago) when dinosaurs had long, long been gone...The exhibit is nice but in all honesty, it's not terribly exciting. There is a video that you can watch but my daughters and I didn't take the time to see it. However, you can make the visit more fun if you've seen the movies ""Ice Age"" and want, for instance, to get an idea of how large the characters were! I have to admit that the gift shop - and the steep hill by the entrance that my girls enjoyed rolling down from!- were the most entertaining features of the Tar pits... (I don't know what the Page museum itself is like). Also, BEWARE of parking fees across the street!! It's $2.25 / 15mn and a maximum of $13.25 (as in most of LA) and you will need cash for it. If your budget is a bit tight, then I'd say save the money for a different activity.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ValayaR
50,"An underrated LA museum, the perfect inter-generational outing.","As a local museumgoer, I've been here numerous times, ranging from school field trips with my kids in their younger days, to taking out of town visiting older in-laws. It's a welcome respite from many other frantic and slick LA sights; it's smaller, cozier, but incredibly fascinating. Toddlers, teens, adults, and senior citizens --- anyone with curiousity about the natural world --- all love it. It's an active paleontology site plus science lab plus natural history museum, all in a small , human scale package that maybe could use some refurbishing but is so very interesting the way it is. Worth a visit on its own, separate from LACMA. Recommend that you head up to Farmer's Market for lunch, though parking is always tight there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RiceMom11

It was very interesting and we had an excellent guide.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LauraM724
40,Dinorama,"Located next to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, there is an actual tar pit with ongoing exploration. Don't try to do both museums in one day.

40,Early LA road works.,"In the early days of LA, tar was removed from these tar pits to pave the dusty streets. Large numbers of prehistoric animals fell into these pits and could not escape. The Page Museum examines the animals and the history of the tar pits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChinoSJP
40,Who knew? Something very different...,"I had no idea that in Los Angeles you can visit a park full of tar pits. And not just tarpits, but ones where they have been excavating prehistoric fossils for a hundred years.The museum is a little sad with aging exhibits, but with many fully complete skeletons of many of the sixty different species they have uncovered. You can see skeletons in many, many museums, but what makes the Page special is that it's an active archeological dig. You can see people working, both scraping out bones outside on top of crated chunks of tar, and also in their glass walled lab, cleaning bits and pieces.you can get here by the 720 bus from downtown or take the red line to Wiltshire and Vermont, then catch the bus. The LA museum is next-door and the folk museum is across the street.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CSSnowshoer

40,Worth a visit with young kids,"We took our six and eight year old kids here. They enjoyed the museum (as did we), with all of the skeletons and fossils, and the ""goldfish"" tank where you can see volunteers cleaning the tar from bones that have been recently excavated. There's plenty to look at for the younger set who may not be into all the historic details, and plenty of info to read for those who want a little more. We probably spent an hour or so inside, then wandered the grounds outside, including walking around the current excavation pits (which are dormant except for summer months). All in all, good for a half day visit and different from museums you'll find just about anywhere else.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Clarkthehorse

I'm not really into science or museums, however I found the Page Museum interesting.The major drawcard here are the mammoth skeletons. Seeing the size of these mammoths in real life gives a perspective that can't get from pictures and TV shows.There were lots of school kids visiting but they didn't bother me. Parking was easy, although there was a charge.Definitely worth a visit for 1.5 to 2 hours if you are visiting the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheWasabiPea

40,3rd choice of visits by the Grandchildren...,We go about twice a year. This last month we took our 2 year old granddaughter and she was really excited with the animal bones and re-creation of the mammoth etc. Also loved the gas bubbles coming up out of the tar. The older kids like the dire wolf skulls and the ongoing work in the labs as well as the dig area. Within walking distance of LA county Art Museum.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BJ928
50,Don't miss this experience!,"There doesn't seem to be a lot of publicity but the La Brea Tar Pits and Page Museum are a not-to-be-missed experience right in the middle of Los Angeles. The museum has reconstructed skeletons of Pleistocene-era sloths, saber cats, horses, dire wolves, short-faced bears, woolly mammoths, coyotes, birds of prey and many other species found in southern California. All have been pulled from the tar pits that surround the museum. Visitors can watch two short movies explaining the origin of the tar pits and how the fossils are recovered. They also can watch as paleontologists work in the laboratory on the actual fossils pulled from the pits. A guided tour of the pits themselves is available (free) and is well worth the time. They also have a nice gift shop with a variety of books for adults and kids, t-shirts, gemstones, toys, souvenirs and snacks. They were shooting an IMAX movie on the museum while we were there which, hopefully, will bring this gem to the attention of more people. Well worth the time and entry fee!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PNWsnowbird

40,Best kept secret,"This museum serves as an introduction to the older history of Los Angeles---as in the glacial age. It gives a better appreciation for where modern LA has come from through the years in terms of animal and geologic history. Great for kids and adults, with interactive displays of prehistoric animals like saber tooth tigers and wooly mammoths. Sometimes you can even watch excavations as they occur. It takes about an hour to get through the museum, including a short video explaining the natural history of the area. Highly recommended as a part of any trip to Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iSkylark
40,interesting,easy to get thru 1-2 hours. Interesting and the fact in middle of LA. Grounds are free outside and a small museum to do on everything they found plus a working lab to watch them clean the bones.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/family0f3kids
50,Hidden Gem!,Very interesting and not frequently mentioned on promotional material in Australia. We found it very interesting and lots of nice healthy places to visit close by.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/celestem_11

40,Fun for an afternoon day trip,"Lived in California my whole life, but had never been here. Went with my sons ages 9 and 11. The museum itself is interesting, and we were able to see everything in about an hour. You are able to see the actual workers in the ""fishbowl"" doing their work with small tools etc. Would have given 5 stars if there had been more hands-on activities in the museum.There is lots of room to run around outside, with an expanse of sloping lawn leading up to the museum - fun to run up the grass and roll back down! We were able to see the old outdoor, excavation site, but no current excavating was going on while we were there. Parking was no problem in the small lot behind the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vaykayfam
40,La Brea Tar Pits,"I lived in Los Angeles for almost 30 years and would drive by this place and I'm glad that we finally took the time to go to visit. It took an out-of-town guest from England that wanted to visit.The museum is simply incredible. If you have never visited, you should go. The whole experience was very educational.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlHernandez1215
40,Fascinating,The La Brea Tar Pits were fascinating. It's hard to imagine that all of the bones on display came from that exact location. I liked how the kids were pulling up on metal rods to demonstrate the difficulty an animal would have to pull out their feet out of the tar. Admission was $11.00 to get inside the museum. They showed a short movie. There is also a green atrium with live fish and turtles inside the museum.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marcia_in_mpls

50,history made fun,i love taking the kids here. kids of all ages always love dinosaurs,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KerryL463
40,free first Tuesday of the Month,this attraction was worth visiting for free. however any child under ten would find it interesting either way. The Page Museum onsite has interactive displays that keep the adults and children alike entertained and informed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CoulesJ
40,This place is very unique,"This is a great museum for kids and students. It is a little out dated, however you can watch them dig for prehistoric bones and fossils.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ConstanTraveler77
40,Cool if you like history,"Thought it was interesting, its 8 bucks for admission and you can cover it in an hour. Watch the video at the theatre.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnaBellAna
40,Fun and educational for the kids,"My brother and his family were visiting from Florida and we decided to take the kids (ages 10, 6 and 3) to this museum. The boys were excited about seeing ""dinosaur"" bones and their cousin (what had been there many times before) was more than happy to show them around.The ticket prices are nominal because it's not a LARGE place. You can see the whole place in about an hour if you have a short attention spans like my nephews or you could take most of the day to look at all the exhibits.There was an area in the musuem where there were people ""dusting"" through the dirt checking for bones and other fossils....Wow, talk about detail oriented. Then outside, the landscape was wide and open and led to an area where the tar pits are.One of the neat features of the museum is that it's built into a hill so there is a floor that looks like you could just walk out into nothing, but actually the hills is just behind the line of sight. My nephews loved freaking out their aunt and mom when they seeming jumped into.....nothing.There is great places to eat across the street if you didn't bring a picnic lunch to eat in the picnic area.....A great place to spend an afternoon, learning with family and spending time as a family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChumsMum01
50,super interesting,"We got there on a Tuesday, and it was free entrance.I wasn't expecting much of it, and thought the kids would be bored. But surprise!Everyone thought it was so cool.Just looking at that tar pit on the open air, for real, and thinking about all those animals that had fallen there, it's just amazing.and on the inside, you can try to moove a lever that sits in the tar; and it's so difficult.Also you can see the people working n the lab.would definitely go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/isatb
50,The most fun you can have in black ooze!,"The history, the stuffed animals and birds, and watching the process of categorizing the bones!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PamK559
30,It's an oil slick.,"I have always wanted to see the La Brea Tar Pits and I MADE my family go with me. I knew it was really nothing to see but I had to see it anyway. I know my friends thought I was crazy for dragging my family there just to see an oil slick but it was fun anyway. We made fun of the sign outside the museum on the steps that says No exercising of any kind allowed on the steps. Of course one video taped as the rest of us ran up the steps and did the Rocky Dance! : ) I still think it is cool that they found dino bones here. Sometimes you just have to see something for yourself no matter how ""dumb"" it is.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KellyPO
50,Cool place!!!,This museum is able to captivate any children interest.Be careful as the parking lot tends to get full as the morning ends.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Waehneldt
40,Awesome few hours,A great way to spend a few hours and see something you've probably only ever heard about in cartoons. Learn a lot about this strange thing located in the middle of a big city.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SuperDuperCoach
50,Amazing,"As one tours this Museum, one becomes truly amazed...It is not a place to be missed!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maurzzzz
40,Interesting alternative history other than Hollywood,We discovered a lot about La Brea that we didn't know. Kids will probably find it interesting as there are heaps of skeletons to view.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlenP_12
40,Fun Family outing,Took a drive up to LA to see the tar pits. Something my husband and I had been to on field trips in elementary school but not since. It was a fun quick adventure and the kids really enjoyed seeing the tar oozing up in places and watching the people cleaning teeny tiny bones and also trying to piece together a jaw bone of a bigger animal.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gardenmomof2
50,Interesting to learn about the prehistoric animals of the LA area!,"Nicely presented exhibits, not flashy but informative. My kids liked the prehistoric animal robots and I loved the friendly docent/volunteers. Go early. Street parking is difficult so I recommend the lot (get your ticket validated and receive a $2 refund upon exiting). It's free to check out the pits in the park. Allow 1-2 hours for your visit. Food trucks galore on Wilshire Blvd.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mattymommy
40,Interesting and enjoyable,"My daughters and I visited the museum and tar pits on a trip to LA. We really enjoyed learning the history of the area, getting to see the many plants and animals that have been discovered there, and seeing how the tar pits are still active today. It is really interesting how these tar pits are there in the middle if this huge city. Definitely recommend a visit here if you have kids under 12 they will really enjoy it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Twohappygirls
50,Personal highlight of LA,My type of museum as dedicated to something I find interresting.Was my number 1 thing to see in LA and didn't disappoint.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Crusaders
50,Lots of fun for everyone,The tar pits are not as cheesy as you'd think. The museum is fun...lots of information engagingly presented. The grounds are attactive and it is fun to see the tar bubbling up from the ground.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SFbmore
50,Super Cool,"See what was happening in Los Angeles a gazillion years ago. See the bones, smell the tar!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HnLA
50,"Amazing, especially if you have kids","This is such a unique collection that it's hard to imagine that anyone wouldn't like it. If you have any interest in archeology, this is museum is a must. The matrix of thousands of years of dinosaur bones, stacked and petrified beneath the tar, is one of the strangest natural sites you will ever see. How do the archeologists take it apart? How do they reassemble the jumble of bones into a proper skeleton? Jet black dinosaur bones are incredibly cool looking. It's fun to watch the scientists at work in the big laboratory in the center of the museum. Just do it. You will rediscover your inner kid.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Superplex
30,Don't go,"So you really don't have to pay for the museum to walk around the parks to see the tarpits. Coming from NY where we have the Museum of Natural History this museum palled in comparison. The tar pits also were unimpressive, just looked like little ponds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelingJenniferR
50,Everything I expected and more,"Growing up with the Flintstones gives you a sense of wanting to know more about that time. The work done and being done at the La Brea Tar Pits and the Page Museum bring it to you. You can see open tar pits (behind safety fences) and the work being done, and has been done. (and thats just outside). Inside they have a closed captioned movie on the work done, displays of whole animals, and displays of what pieces they have found to see what life was like in the time of the animals caught in the tar pits. You can also see work (finds, cataloging, cleanings of bones of tar) being done LIVE in the Fishbowl.Parking is easy and cheap (half price of what LACMA is charging on the same site). There is a big park and you can come to just walk, play or have a picnic.We had a great time and learned more than we had thought. Very cool, would go again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ablackram
40,Interesting,"I was surprised that I liked this place, but I learned a lot. Thousands of years ago many animals walked into the tar pits and met their end. Their bones were preserved in the goop and excavation has been going on since the 1920s and continues to this day. This museum explains all that, shows you what was found and what is being found, lets you watch real archaeologists at work and shows the area before and after oil was discovered there.The vast quantity of bones as well as seeing a real archeaelogical dig site were interesting and educational.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DesignCat
40,Stuck a little past....a few updates would help....still a great experience!,"My experience at the Page Museum at the La Brea Tar Pits was extremely enjoyable. I just think that the Museum could use some money to update some of the exhibits. Some of the video exhibits are from the 80's. Other than some of the exhibits being a little outdated (let's face it that is any museum), the Page museum makes the process of getting the bones from pit to exhibit come to life. The painstaking process is so far behind, about 10 years apparently, that the rich collection is seemingly a victim of its own success. The grounds allow you to see the excavation process of the bones, though the smell of sulphur is strong. The admission price is reasonable at around 12 bucks. I think the Page Museum is worth the effort for anyone to visit so that a appreciation of man's history can take place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tdsuperstar
40,Extremely well done - cool exhibits,"Before we visited the La Brea Tar Pits, I had a pre-conceived notion that it would be kind of cheesy. No, it's a beautiful park, a true archaeological dig (ongoing), and a pretty fascinating museum, appropriate for all ages. Great exhibits and an overall beautiful property.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/laketravishill
40,Unique,"I've been here many times over the years and it's a great place to visit.Lots of museums have dinosaurs. Very few have their own pliocene tar pit with active research where you can see saber tooth tigers and giant sloths. If you are a science geek you will like it.Some reviewers seem to think L.A. is some sort of theme park. And it isn't. The tar pits are still active putting out various odors, sinking and rising and buckling the pavement. If you go next door to LACMA you will see CO gas monitors to warn you if the tar pits have a huge burp.My only comments are try to go early or later to avoid school groups. Also two hours is plenty. Spend the day and go visit LACMA as well.Just don't go Weds. because all LA museums are CLOSED Weds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/phil32530
40,"A little old school, but you have to do it!","I have probably been to the Tar Pits 4 times. I used to live right around the corner from it, so it was a favorite place to take out of town visitors.I'll start by saying that the park surrounding the museum is really nice. You can just walk around, your kids can play, you can see the iconic mammoths sinking into the tar, you can even see on-going fossil excavations, and you would never have to go inside and pay admission. I had my engagement photos taken in the park I love it so much.The museum building is very nice, and if you show a USC student ID your admission is free. Some of the things inside the museum look like they haven't changed since they opened in 1977. The first video you watch is priceless for its antiquated animation style, but when I think about it I smile.The fossil collections are really impressive in scope to have come from such a small area. There is a ""fish bowl"" where you can actually watch the paleontologists working on the new bones that are still coming in. You can also go to a little inner garden area that is very tranquil. And there is a modern video near the end of the loop that is well done and entertaining.The Los Angeles County Museum of Art is right next door, so if you've already paid for parking you might want to check that out too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TrystaB
40,Interesting stuff - but plan your journey there better than I did,"I quite liked this museum, as it was a decent size, yet not too big that I lost interest in it before completing it - (as that always sets off the internal conflict of opportunity cost of leaving/not leaving).Unfortunately, I mis-judged where it was/ distance from the Wilshire / Western metro station, so I was walking for the best part of an hour to get there. The return journey (back to Hollywood) was much more pleasant, as I took a bus back to Hollywood/Vine.After visiting there (and before catching the bus back) I went next door to IHOP (International House of Pancakes) as you get all you can eat pancakes for about US$4.95. If I did it again with more time, I would probably check out LACMA (Los Angeles County Museum of Art) which was also right next door.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mr_vigilante
50,Thank you TAR,"If you don’t know about La Brea “The Tar from Spanish” over many centuries oil seeped up in this part of the USA long before it was a country let alone LA. the sun would crack the oil removing the lighter parts and leaving a thick black tar, winds and rain would cover the tar with a layer of earth/dust and seeds would blow there with the earth and germinate eventually becoming lush vegetation, along would come a 8 to 9 ton Mastodon and whilst eating the grass/shrubs would start to sink into the tar, at this point it is all over as the more you struggle the more it grip’s you and you slowly sink into the tar! There is an exhibit that shows this with a container of tar and a foot you can try to pull out. Now seeing an incapacitated Mastodon sabre toothed cats would attack and start to eat the poor old thing but leaving it too late they would also become stuck! With loads of carrion, vultures would settle on the whole lot and as soon as feathers became covered it tar they too became carrion. This process would end and everybody slowly sank into the tar together then the wind and rain would bring a fresh covering and …. Well I guess you can see where this goes!This carried on for many centuries in fact the Mastodon died out in North America 11,000 years ago “on a Thursday just after tea”, and therefore scientists can see how the animals evolved over time, to this end there is a wall of Wolf sculls (hundreds) dated and showing changes over thousands of years.We were taken there by some friends and when my friends and I got back to the entrance realised that my wife was missing (no she hadn’t joined the exhibits) she was so fascinated by what she was seeing that she got left behind.LA is full of attractions and La Brea is almost lost amongst Universal, Disney Land, Knott’s Berry Farm Six flags etc. but if you want to be fascinated get a bit of pre-history have a really good time and lose your wife ….. there isn’t a better place in LA.CheersPhil",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bobsbuddy
50,Los Angeles Tar Pits,"My family and I visited the La Brea Tar Pits before Thanksgiving 2011. This was a very interesting attraction. The actual tar pits were enclosed by a fence and we were ablesee the movement of the tar bubbling in the pit. The page museum was full of veryinteresting exhibits and were very informative. There was a small theatre available showing a film about the history of the La Brea Tar Pits. It was a surprising and informative exhibit to find in the middle of a major city as Los Angeles, California.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mom022
40,Mammoths & Saber Tooths in Los Angeles?? Yup!,I have been here countless times with children and visitors to town. There really are tar pits that still exist right in the heart of L.A. that are underground and even out of the ground and visible!! The museum houses a vast collection of bones found in these tar pits. It is very close to the Petersen car museum & LA county museum of art. I recommend the film that plays close to the entrance every 1/2 hr and really explains what you are about to see. This museum is a must for children!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thewindatourfeet
50,Beats the Tar Out of Me,"A fascinating place. When you walk into the museum, you are met with the skeleton of a mammoth. The sign on the display says lots of things that mostly boil down to ""this is a small one."" I would hate to meet a large one if that one is considered ""small."" They of course have saber-toothed tigers (really more of a mountain lion) cave bears, cave lions, etc. Only one person has ever been found in the pits, and she is on display. The pits are on Wilshire in the middle of a heavily urban area, so it is hard to get a picture of what the area looked like all those millenia ago. One of the most interesting things that popped to my mind is that most of the animals unlucky enough to get stuck in the pit have relatives still living today in area of the world much like what southern california was when the pioneers got there. Many of those animals, like the cave bear and cave lion, were much larger than their modern-day cousins, but anatomically they were otherwise the same. Why did the lions and tigers and bears (Oh, My!) and mammoths and mastodons we find in the pits die out when their modern cousins still live in similar eco-systems in other parts of the world? Because, I guess.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnW878
40,Interesting,The La Brea Museum is unique and informative.The outside grounds continue to smell of tar and are still being excavated for more fossils. Being located within the city limits it is an easy option for sightseeing during a LAX layover. Guided tours are available.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ofmyheart
50,"Yes, Virginia, there are tar pits in L.A.","The museum has quite a variety of artifacts. The ""fishbowl"" were you can observe the researchers preparing and examining fossils is quite interesting.Being able to enter some of the excavations and see the pits is a nice touch. And the large pit with the mastadon models in front of the museum is an eye-catcher.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KommissarKen
40,you must see the LaBrea tar pits at least once while in LA,"The price was a bit high for an attraction that hasnt changed or improved for 22 years that I have been ocassioning the pits....but it is definetly a kids freindly place...lots to teach the youngins and if you like Smilodon skulls they have the most (hundreds on display) thats the SabreTooth tiger btw....also Dire Wolf skeletons, a mammoth.....and a few others...some displays of indian artifacts....some tar pits to check out....some pricy gifts in the gift shop etc...good for about 2 hours of entertainment there are other museums and such nearby....so find a good parking spot and stuff the meter or pay for the day at the parking area",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vegasphotoman1
40,Very Interesting,Interesting museum. Friendly staff. Nice gift shop. Impressive exhibit of animals.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Braden_Israel
40,Interesting but not quite worth $11,The Page Museum is interesting but a bit small to charge $11 admission. Can be done easily in under 45 minutes reading every caption under every exhibit. The web site says $9 cash to park - I parked in the underground LACMA lot which was $10. Walking around the tar pits is free and that is very interesting. The LACMA next door charges $15. We were there during mid day and there was a good assortment of food trucks parked across the street on Wilshire which was an added benefit to the day.The museum is a small donut shape exhibit area that I do recommend but just be aware of price. $8 for students.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mctrvl
50,Amazing Dinosaur remains,"If you were sceptical about dinosaurs before, you won't be after going here. They have pulled out and carefully reassembled lots and lots of bones, pretty amazing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeirdreLamb
30,A little disappointing but still interesting,"We were expecting a little more from the Page Museum to be honest. We didn't find the exhibits to be very engaging and the whole museum seemed a little tired and in need of updating.It was interesting to visit the pit outside and learn about current excavations and we were also interested in learning about the history of the area, but I don't think we would bother to visit again. It seems like they could do so much more with this museum to make it more enticing for adults and children alike. It is still maybe worth a short visit for those who are particularly interested in the Ice Age.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RachelfromOz
50,Facinating Museum with Beautiful Grounds,"We parked on the street for free and very close to the entrance - already a plus . The grounds leading in to the museum are beautiful, and it's quiet and peaceful which is amazing considering the busy area that it is situated in.Several different viewing areas on the grounds allow you to see the ongoing search for fossils in the tar. Very interesting, The displays are well marked and educational.The inside museum has a sort of mini tarpit display with a hands on experience to help you grasp what it was like when animals walked into these tarpits.The recreations of the pre-historic animals are phoenominal.The entry price is reasonable, staff very helpful, bathrooms clean, many interesting exhibitsCons: None I can think of...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Off2SeeItAll

50,Fantastic find in the heart of L.A.,"Spent half a day at the La Brea Tar Pits and museum after seeing it on TV a few months earlier. This place is amazing, the fact that tar seeps up through the ground at random locations in the centre of LA is bizarre! The endless amount of Ice Age fossils still being found there is amazing. Great guided tour and exhibits. Well worth the trip to reality as opposed to the fake movie theme parks. Kids will love it. If they had somewhere on the grounds to buy food we didnlt see it, but a short walk found great places for lunch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/beenthere088
40,Very cool,"Featured in movies like Volcano, this place is pretty cool. Lots to see and do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nick_Renwick
40,Interesting Museum,Building is dated but the finds are facinating. Also interesting is the ongoing dig for additional fossils.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Natsfandc
50,Awesome museum in the middle of Los Angeles,"We had a day to kill when we needed a break from Disneyland so we drove across the basin to see the tar pits and visit the museum. It is a small facility in the middle of a beautiful park. It was a beautiful day. The museum was very clean and not overpriced. The exhibits were very cool and the ""fishbowl"" where the scientists were working was very cool. We went on a walk thru the park to see the tar bubbling up in several areas.The kids and adults loved it.Also, be VERY careful parking. Read all of the signs if you park on the street as they will tow you right away! The Screen Writers Guild has a lot on the East side of the park that is affordable and had plenty of spots.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ke7dkg
40,Ancient LA in modern times.,Very interesting a must see. We got in on a walking tour with Guide it takes about 45 minutes plus the 10 min film in the Page Museum.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PatriciaS873
50,"Great Museum, excellent value","My wife and I stopped by at the Page Museum as a side trip before leaving for Las Vegas. We enjoyed the layout of the museum, and an added bonus was seeing the anthropologist working on actual fossils. I would recommend this museum highly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ClarenceG107
50,Black Guck Rich In History,"Tour the exhibits in the Page Museum to learn about the dinosaurs found in this area. Then walk outside and check out the tar pits where thousands of years of history has become stuck in time. If you're lucky, you can even see a new pit being excavated. This is fun and educational for the whole family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lih
50,Very Interesting,We spent several hours at the Tar Pits and Museum. It was quite interesting. I think everyone should see the Mammoth and the Dire Wolf.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ardmoreflyer

50,Best example of Ice Age LA,"The Page Museum has the very best examples of Ice Age mammals in the country. The displays are right up close and easily viewable even for small kids. The staff is very friendly and will answer any questions you have. You can watch how they clean the bones (because they are in asphalt these are not fossils but real bones) in the real lab where they do all the work!! Check out how the newest find, ZED a hugh Mammoth with both of his tusks, is coming along in his cleaning process. Go visit The Page Museum and find out how Mammals ruled LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KandiV
50,"just walk around the tar pits, don't go to museum","I took the bus from downtown LA (city bus, not the tourist bus! $1.50 each way! Great deal!) to Wilshire and Fairfax to meet a friend for lunch right by the tar pits, so before heading back downtown to the hotel, I walked around the tar pits. They're literally just big pits of tar, but it's definitely worth checking out if you're already there. I didn't pay to go to the museum; I just walked around the tar pits. I also walked around the sculpture garden at the attached Los Angeles County Museum of Art--again, free and totally worth it. There were lots of people strolling around, and it was well laid out/labeled. Great free entertainment!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/go4elk
50,Cool place to spend an hour or two,"First, let me start by saying that we only walked around the outdoor tar pit area and did not go into the Page Museum because we were flying home that day. That being said, I'm so glad we squeezed in a visit to the tar pits on our last day of vacation. It was such a cool (and free!) experience to be within a such a metropolitan area, yet still feel like you were thousands of years back in time. You can smell the tar and still see it bubbling. We walked around quite a bit and were amazed that there are even areas that aren't fenced in that have the tar bubbling to the surface. If we had more time, we definitely would have tried the Page Museum as well, though our hour at the tar pits was time very well spent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RebeccaMinNJ
40,Very dated...but worth the money and time!,"OK...so this place is incredibly dated in so many ways. The videos, the displays, etc, etc. Sadly, you can tell funding is non-existent here. But, for only $11, it's still a very cool museum to check out! While things are dated, they're still very interesting and correct!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alstensby
50,Get tared and feathered,Interesting side of nature with the tar bubbling up underground gas and a great working museum. Not crowded at all (I saw Dog [bounty hunter] visiting) Real nice atmosphere. Even a gift shop. Right on Wilshire blvd.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/coveredwagon
50,A vivid ancient history lesson,"The La Brea Tar Pits have been on my radar ever since I learned about them in elementary school, now a very long time ago. The Page Museum provided a fascinating glimpse at LA history long before anything existed that is recognizable today. Still enigmatically perking in 2011 right in the middle of Los Angeles' hustle and bustle, the Pits and the museum shouldn't be missed. There is even an ongoing scientific examination and cataloging of the animals retrieved from the pits viewable by guests.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cyndave111
50,"Informative, educational, and fun",We visited with 2 children 5 and 3 and we all had a blast. The exhibits are interesting and fun. Great way for kids to learn about prehistoric animals.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Srsignore
40,To see actual dinosaur bones being excavated has a totally different impact than a museum!,"I've been to many museums and I've seen many dinosaur skeleton replicas. Intellectually I know that dinosaurs roamed the United States eons ago but being at the La Brea Tar Pits and seeing an excavation site and seeing dinosaur bones being taken from the actual ground was a totally different experience. Right there in the middle of bustling Los Angeles are the remains of dinosaurs! You look around and there are buildings and busy streets. You look DOWN and there are monsters from the past! I did thing the actual tar pits were going to be a bit more intimidating than they were but overall it was a great visit and I would definitely suggest that you make this one of your stops when visiting LA. It will definitely give you a different perspective on our world.Admission is free on the first Tuesday of each month, except July and August.Admission Prices:Members: FreeChildren 4 and under: FreeChildren 5-12 years old: $5.00Youths 13-17, Seniors 62+ and College Students with I.D.: $8.00Adults: $11.00Museum Parking:The Museum's parking lot is located at the corner of Curson Ave and 6th St, directly behind the museum (enter from the western side of Curson Ave).Monday - FridayCASH ONLY: $9.00 ($2 returned upon exit from parking lot with vehicle and presentation of ticket with Page Museum validation)Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Holidays:CASH ONLY: $7.00 flat rateBe sure to bring your parking ticket into the museum to receive your validation.Important Note About Parking:If you choose street parking over the museum lot, please read all parking signs carefully, as restrictions apply.

40,Very interesting attraction at minimal expense right in the middle of LA,This was a very interesting attraction. My teenage boys enjoyed it. Not expensive and has parking. We spent a couple of hours there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/memeNewcastle
40,La Brea Tar Pits,"I travelled here from Hollywood via a bus. It was a reasonable walk from the bus stop, but you get to walk past LACMA. The entry is quiet affordable and is worth every cent. Although this does not take long 1-2 hours roughly, it is nice to see the Tarpits. The Page museum is interesting and gives you a larger perspective of the discoveries in the region. It's worth a visit, if your in the area or looking to fill in sometime.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SarahEAKennedy
40,Very different and worth seeing,This is a very weird find in the middle of a city - a place to see pre-historic creatures. They have done a great job at making this place informative and really interesting. I got here late which meant I only had less than 1 hour - on the plus side I got the ticket for half price!Worth a trip with kids who are wild this stuff - and for those who can be inspired.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ClareL_11
50,Great Museum,"We took our 10 yr old son and we all loved this place. The displays were good, the tour was very informative and the bones were VERY cool. A great place to take young kids--they can run in the park too.This park is also right next door to the LA Co. Museum of Art which had a huge number of exhibits: Modern, Asian, Ancient. It's also a block from the Petersen Auto Museum.Visit Page Museum in the morning, eat lunch next door at the LACM restaurant, then walk half a block during the afternoon to the Petersen Auto Museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Firstmmo
40,Interesting even for non-science types,"The bubbling tarpits are an interesting oddity in the middle of LA. The Page Museum (adjacent) really explains their significance very well. Excellent skeletal reconstructions and displays. Also includes a window into a working lab, where you can watch staff preparing a recently acquired skeleton for exhibition.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NHSDteacher
50,Good for adults great for kids,"La brea is a really good museum. We went in the morning and the parking lot seemed to be sufficient for the whole day (when we left it still wasn't full). The museum it not that big which keeps it interesting for kids. But the content in really nice, interesting and fun for everybody. You can see, feel and learn lots of things about what happened many years ago. The entrance fee is in line with the duration spend there. The content of the museum exceeds it!As La Brea is only about 30 min from several other locations like Walk of Fame, Griffith Observatory it is a good way to start the day.We finished the museum at about lunchtime. The good thimg is that across the road of the museum there are many popular street vendors with their truck. I would say go there and try a taco or any of the other foodtypes they have. The office people there surely do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Marten162
50,Very Interesting!,"It was very interesting to see that those animal's bones were preserved in tar for so long! It was very cool to see all of the bones in the museum and there is also a section in the museum where you can see archaeologists putting bones together! I would 100% recommend to go to this, especially if you have kids!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travel_Man1122
40,A Pleasant Surprise,"I remember seeing the tar pits when I was a kid, I recall being fascinated. I don't remember the museum. My 8 year old son with ADHD was delighted with the museum. I guess the apple doesn't fall far...We viewed the tarpits first, then the live dig, after about 1/2 hour outside we entered the museum. It was 4:35pm, so we got 1/2 price tickets and saw pretty much everything in 25 minutes. Very cool laboratory display. Also the live dig outside is interesting...along with the actual tarpits of course. All in all we spent an hour and had a very satisfying visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DMBLover11
50,Life after Dinosaurs!!! Pretty Rad.,"Such a special museum. I have been several times over the years of visiting LA, and it never disappoints. It is such a treasure trove of information, and it is all set up in the place where they found all of the bones! The tar pits are still there, and still being excavated. Its fascinating to be so close to something to priceless. There is a smell, but you get used to it pretty quickly. The LACMA is close by as well, so if you have the time do both museums.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mariemarblehead
50,Small but mighty: a one of a kind museum,"This museum is much smaller than it's cousin, The Natural History Museum, but it offers something that can't be found anywhere else: real live paleontologists onsite digging bones out of the inky goo that lies beneath the entire complex. Visitors can watch volunteers and scientists at work in the tar pits behind the museum, while inside, more volunteers painstakingly clean the bones that have been found--from gigantic mastodon tusks to tiny mouse bones. In fact, the museum's collection is about to double in size thanks to the discovery of a whole new deposit of bones. My daughter never tires of seeing the great bubbling pond in front of the museum where mastodon models are ""stuck"" in the tar. The museum is small but fascinating, screens one or two educational films on the tar pits and features a great gift shop. Snacks can be had at nearby restaurants or in the snack bar of the county art museum, right next door.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mhberg
40,Great idea - only slightly mired in tar...,"We took our young kids on a recent LA visit. Super easy to get to - I had no idea it'd be in the middle of LA! The kids loved the giant sloths and sabre-toothed cats outside, as well as the 'icky' big tar pit. The museum has got some good stuff: pull the tar to see how it's sticky, the holographic cats, etc, but there are parts of the museum that are sort of weirdly dated and boring.The BEST part is the outdoor live worksites, but they are sort of oddly located and tough to find. Make sure to make enough time to visit the worksites and talk to the workers - they were incredibly interesting and really nice to us and the kids.Bring wet wipes because there is a lot of tar around on the grass that gets on your shoes...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leighod
50,The site is a must see....very interesting,"The tar pits is a must see attraction. Very easy to get to...located off Wilshire Blvd, LA. The outdoor display is free and awesome. The museum is very interesting. There is a small charge to go into the museum. There are free guided tours in the museum throughout the day explaining all the exhibits. You can park at the location for a fee or parking is available on the streets surrounding the site...just bring quarters for the meters.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travlady2
30,Disappointing,We only went to tarpits - not museum. Took us longer to park than to look at the tarpits. I would suggest looking for street parking rather than paying to park in the parking lot.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Stonese
50,"If you like Ice Age animals and paleontology, you must come here!","Initially, I had wanted to bring my family to a California museum that had a dinosaur exhibit. But when I heard about the La Brea tar pits that were real excavation sites, I figured it might be more interesting and intriguing to see.And I think I was right :) My kids were intrigued to see the tar pits that were still bubbling (although they didn't like the tar smell). It's too bad we didn't get to see anyone at work in Pit 91.We did get to see some people working to clean up some fossils in their Fishbowl Lab in the Page Museum. That was really cool!In the museum, they were showing a short film about the history of the La Brea tar pits and the Page Museum. Good to watch so you can better appreciate the work being done there.From the souvenir shop, my kids bought a small bottle of tar goo which they continue to play with until now, weeks after our trip there. A bit like playing with Play Doh, but you have to be more careful because it sticks to your clothes! Love their souvenir shop :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leasj
20,You do not need to go to the museum - just walk to area where tar pits are located,I paid to go inside the museum and was disappointed. They charge $11 for adults and $5 for kids but I was not impressed with the museum. Just read information on-line regarding the tar pits and walk around and look at them.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SouthFloridaCoolmom
50,A Gem in Downtown L.A.,"Our family loved the Page Museum and Tar Pits. The caveat is that we have a 6-year old who can't stand Disneyland and loves low-key, educational, natural history activities. It was quiet, fascinating and well-worth the trip downtown for our family. What a surprise. Grounds are lovely and would have enjoyed seeing the other museums if we'd had the time. With a limited visit, we were so happy to find Page. When even science museums these days can be over-stimulating and created for a video game-loving, internet generation (which most times makes it more fun for us as the Mom & Dad) it was such a pleasure to experience a more organic, thoughtful, old-school museum. It was great to slow down and read about this amazing paleontologic find. We also really enjoyed the brief, behind-the-scenes movie. Also appreciated the art and timeline that puts the Earth's development, the era of the tar pits and humans in perspective. Nice way to slow down in a busy city and appreciate our natural world.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/smel
50,Spectacular Natural History Lesson,"The grounds are free and informative. Makes one ponder the fact that nature extinguished exotic species not all that long ago (6,000 -10,000 years). Folks past fifty years of age know that 6,000 years is just 120 (or less) of their lifetimes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BillRockMadison
30,Worth a visit,"As others have said it is outdated. However, we found it very interesting to read the details about the different species found in the tar and the pits themselves. Took about an hour to see everything. If you are in LA it is definitely worth a stop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kimmer76
40,Fun Little Museum,"Definitely a fun museum and also a small one, so if you'd like someplace to go with a limited amount of time (1-2 hours) this is a very good option. Although the museum does show its age, the exhibits are still fascinating and the fishbowl-style Lab at the center of the museum is a particular draw. Also, the museum itself is situated in a lovely park next to the LACMA and parking is only $2 with museum validation - probably the cheapest parking in all of LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaiaB
50,Awesome tour!,This attraction takes place inside and outside. Very amazing to see what kind of things you can dig up and out of the ground from a tar pit. Very educational on geology and how the tar pits were formed. There is no place to eat but vending machines for drinks and restrooms. You can also watch volunteers clean up fossils. This is great for little kids!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnnieJ97
50,Worth checking out,"My husband and I went and the museum and outdoor area were very interesting, it took us about 1-1.5 hours to look at everything. I would recommend this for families as well as anyone interested in science, nature, and animals. We took the hop on/hop off bus to Lacma and walked to the museum, about 5 min away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kate680
40,Family fun and affordable,"Took two 20-somethings, two moms and a teenager and ended up spending a lot of time there. The fossils were so interesting and the displays were very well done. Too bad the fishbowl was closed for the weekend. I loved the signs they had around explaining what they were doing.The active dig pits were very interesting. They were featured on a TV show, so seeing them in person and smelling them was neat for us all. The grounds were well maintained and easy to navigate. The walk to the active digs wasn't very far at all. We also had fun climbing around the museum's outdoor sculptures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GingelaOK
50,La Brea Tar Pits - fascinating place to visit,We read about the La Brea Tar Pits online and arranged to visit while in Los Angeles. We are a family of 2 adults and 2 children and all found this museum fascinating. The tar pits are famous for the thousands of ice age animals that became trapped in the tar and couldn't escape. Being from Australia we had never seen anything like it. The museum has a bubbling oil pool outside. It is a current excavation site and has thousands of bones and specimens on display. The kids loved it. I don't know of any tours that feature La Brea but it is definitely worth a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bondies
40,Very Nice!,Great family spot. Lots to see. Great for Kids. They should update though. Parking is cheap and on-site.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Laudan525
40,Interesting Place,"I always wondered how tar pits ended up in the middle of Los Angeles, and the video in the museum helped me to understand this. The museum needs an upgrade, but there are all sorts of bones that have been dug out of the tar pits so far, including lions and mammoths. Outside, you can visit the tar pit sites. If people are working on one of the sites, you can stand there and watch. You can see the tar pits without paying the museum admission, but you will not see the bones or learn about the history of the tar pits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pilotgirl21
30,Interesting but really needs an update,"This museum was built in 1977 and not a single thing has changed apparently. All of the exhibits are dated 1977 and some of the info is not up to modern ecological standards, but it's not expensive and if you're into fossils you will enjoy it. The actual tar pits outside and the working digs are the best part, so make sure to explore the grounds outside if you go, you can watch the asphalt bubbling up and see exposed bones! I hope that LA County has this on their list of funding expenditures but it's a really important resource in need of some serious help.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/COtoAK
40,Interesting park and museum,We took the time to visit this spot in LA. We enjoyed the mseum and watching the workers that were cleaning and organizing all of the recovered bones.The tar pits are strange. There is a slight odor of the tar in the air around them.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ct-cruisers
50,Fascinating,"Smack dab in the middle of the city is this fascinating place with literally tons of history. The museum is well done and has a lovely open air atrium for relaxing in a tropical rainforest setting. Seeing the dig site is amazing, as well as the little squares of fencing where the tar continues to ooze up through the grass. Well worth visiting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/speedlady1
30,"Neat Park to Walk Through, Museum might be a pass...","You can walk through the La Brea Tar Pits area without payment. Its a great LA Freebie. Walking through the park you can see the pits and the dig sights, taking in most of what is going on in the park.We also purchased admission to the musueum. Unless you're a huge fossil buff, its a little outdated. There are several reconstucted skeltons and history of the area, but for the most part, not updated since the 1980s. You can view volunteers processing small fossils in the ""fishbowl"" and also see a movie.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ryanprint
50,Unique experience,"A very interesting place, the tar pits are fascinating as they bubble away giving off a slight odour and allowing tar to reach the surface. The ""mammoths"" allow you to visualise how the place must have once looked, quite difficult as they are now in LA!The Page museum explains things well, just enough detail without becoming too involved. It was great to see the volunteers at work - their patience in sorting pollen grains from bone fragments etc impressive. You can also go to see the excavation pit and the work at project 23. All well worth half a days visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SENCO
50,A Great Find,"I went in, not really knowing what to expect. But came out telling everyone about what a unique destination this is. You have to pay to park, but the grounds are free, which is great. And it was so interesting to see. I would suggest everyone does this!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Metsfan1
40,Very Neat right in the middle of LA,"VERY neat attractiobn...Thought we missed this because it is literally next to a major blvd. in LA -- it is FREE... (museum = FEE, not worth visiting)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jazz-key
40,Worth a visit!,"We took our 11 and 12 year old to the museum. They had a fine time looking at and learning about the fossils. We had several field trip classes there that same day, so to escape the noise, we went into the garden they have right in the middle of the museum and that was enjoyable as well. I definitely recommended it if you are in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PRprincess76
40,Great family destination in LA.,"My 9 year old wants to be a paleontologist when she grows up, so we knew she would love the Tar Pits, but even my jaded 13 year old enjoyed it. The docent who led our tour added a lot of details about the preserved skeletons of now-extinct species - things that simply walking around the museum ourselves we would have never known. The slowly bubbling pockets of bitumen in the park outside the museum were fun to poke at with sticks. Unique destination.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CambridgeMike
50,Great education in the middle of L.A.!,"My husband and I visited the Page Museum in April. Loved that it was only $7 a person and fantastic displays of fossils they've found and a timeline of the area. There's even a ""fishbowl"" type set up where you can see people actually working on fossils. Very educational, and then you could go out and see two actual areas of excavation. So cool. Great area too; other museums to visit if you want.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MNJenRN
50,Fascinating place for kids & adults alike.,"We spent a few fun hours at the tar pits and would return on our next trip. It's a great, inexpensive and educational diversion for the kids & also the adults. The pits are great to watch and the museum has hands-on exhibits as well as a viewing area where you can see volunteers at work, working on bones as large as mammoth hip bones, and as small as mouse toe bones! The shop there also has some great educational games & books that are very reasonably priced. Entry to the museum is very cheap, and entry to the grounds is free. We loved it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dromomaniac
40,Make this a stop in your LA trip,"Thought it would be a cheesy tourist trap, but I was pleasantly surprised with the large park-like outside area and nicely appointed natural history museum. A good value ($7) for a couple hours of interesting entertainment. Really found it to be a fascinating sight! Easy street parking (weekend).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/natjaye
40,Much better than expected,"This was one of the attractions we gave a miss when we visited LA last year due to a lack of time and also we thought it didn't sound very interesting. When we returned this year, we decided to check it out. Surprisingly, all of us found the exhibits and show very interesting and informative. My children, ages 6 & 9, had a great time looking and reading about the exhibits. Overall, it was very educational and we are glad we visited it.We had planned to stay for a couple of hours but ended up staying a little longer. If the open working pits had been in operation when we went, we would definitely have stayed longer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mom2rascals
40,Fun way to spend a couple hours for a family.,"We did the Page Museum and other nearby attractions (like the Peterson Automotive museum) on a rainy day during our recent trip to LA. It's also right next to LACMA (LA County Museum of Art).This museum is reasonably priced, as was parking, which was nice. It was not very large though, and doesn't take very long to see everything. They do have an informational movie running that was interesting and gives a lot of history.Highlights were the grounds outside, including Pit 91 and the other fenced off tar pits. The girls had fun even though it was raining.Only real negative is that it isn't very large as far as museums go, but that was also a hidden positive as it allowed us to get in some more sites that day.We liked the gift shop, and bought some nice things there too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FamilyVacationsMN
40,"Inexpensive, interesting family diversion","What an unusual place to spend a couple of hours! Admission is very reasonable as is parking and the story of the fossil remains underneath your feet is quite interesting. The movie presentations were well done and added to the experience. All of this is capped off by a walk around the grounds in the California sunshine watching the tar seep through the pits and fenced in grassy areas. With a little careful searching, you may even find tar spots on the ground yet to be fenced in! I recommend this attraction for families with young children.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/skipsterNewYork
50,Great for all ages!,"There are several other great reviews, but briefly, I will say that our family (3 boys - ages 4.5 and twin 19 month olds) all enjoyed the museum and grounds. The various spots around the park where tar is bubbling up are amazing! There are two excavation sites to view which is very cool to see - and helps kids understand a little better.If you will be there during a mealtime, there is lots of beautiful grass and trees to picnic on and under. There are also several restaurants within walking distance, but something in me just wanted to plop down on the grass and have a picnic! :)The art museum is right next door, so you can make a day of this great outing!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MChildress
50,Great museum and garden/tarpits,"The Page Museum does a great job of explaining how the La Brea tar pits came to have such a treasure of skeletons of animals, and how they are researching the skeletons and artifacts they have found. Even though we went with our adult son, we couldn't help but notice that there were plenty of young kids there also enjoying the place. They did a great job of showing the timeline for the animals found in the tar pits as well as the timeline for the La Brea area in the last few hundred years. After visiting the museum, we walked around the grounds. We saw the working areas where they are actively processing more skeletons and the preserved bacteria etc that were ofund with them. We saw some of project 23, which is 23 large containers of remains that were set aside when the LACMA built a new parking garage. They set aside these chunks of dirt, which seemed to range from 4x4x4 to many times that size, and they are slowly going through them with their hand tools to see what they have. Fascinating to watch them cleaning the bones, and fascinating to see some of the parts of Zed, a mastodon they found that seems to be mostly intact, including some large tusks - large like 6 feet long and serpentine curved. We will return to see Zed when the work is completed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/billd2005
40,Not exactly what I expected but still worth the visit,"I was imagining a huge smoldering tar pit like something from the movies. The scale is much smaller than that but you can still see asphalt seeping onto the surface, mostly in fenced areas. You can smell the gasses that bubble up and it's fun watching the big methane bubbles billow and pop on the surface. You can also tour an existing excavation site if you are there at the right time. There's no charge to observe the pits but you'll have to pay the museum entrance fee to see the intriguing fossils. My favorites were the ground sloth, ancient bison, mammoth and dire wolves. There are also nice fossils of the sabre-toothed cat, american lion, mastadon, horse, deer, camel, short-faced bear, a variety of birds and more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jhwkr972
50,We loved it,We visited in early May with our 7 and 9 year old sons. We all absolutely loved it and it was a highlight of our 3 week trip through the US and Canada. Thank you so much to the lovely volunteer who was working in the excavation site building 'out the back' at around lunchtime on May 5 - she spent so much time with my boys and their million questions. I would recommend this site to anyone with children.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travelinwkids14
40,"Kid Friendly, Adults will want to know more","Being the science nerd that I am, I wanted a little more information from my visit to La Brea Tar Pits. I found their explanations of the Tar Pits to be very elementary; the informative exhibits were a little vague and spotty. Some aspects (like the animatronics and movies) were just badly in need of updating. That said, the visit was really fun, with indoor and outdoor activities. Kids seemed fascinated with it all, and my crew (of young adults) were well entertained for about two hours. No one complained about the price of admission.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amandapie
10,Underwhelming,I was very disappointed in this location. The grounds were in disrepair and the museum was not worth the money charged. I have been to roadside attractions for free that were a better way to kill time.As I stated the grounds were run down and there was litter everywhere. It appears that any income that is brought in is going somewhere other than keeping this place up because it was very run down.Very little was happening in the area of excavation and there was no explanation of any of it.Overall I was very disappointed that we wasted our limited time in town at this location. I would advise everyone to avoid it. There are much better ways to spend your time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cubsblue
40,A great museum in the heart of LA,"This is really a great museum right in the heart of Las Angeles. It depicts LA as it was about 40,000 years ago and has a large collection of Ice Age plants and animals. They have a fantastic museum inside but it's what they have outside that I found best. The place has life sized replicas of Ice Age animals trapped in the tar pits. They are realistic and show how many of the animals of that era met their fate. It is an informative way to spend a few hours in Las Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/globeseeker007
50,Wild Wilshire,An awesome experience. The restorations are very realistic and displayed in a naturalistic setting. The tarpits themselves can be seen from the street but its well worth the walk in the gardens to get inside the museum. There is a handson display of the tar. Trying to pull the rod out of it will make you want to run out and change your engine oil. Watch the lake long enough and you will see a methane bubble explode.Also near by is the Musuem of Art and the Peterson Auto Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spinkick
50,It's Fun!!,"The place is a great place to visit if you like science and fossils. These are not dinosaur fossils, though. They are fossils of=2 0ice age animals that got trapped in the seeping tar. It is a great place to spend 40 minutes and see something. The Los Angeles County Museum of Art is right next door, so very worth it to see two places at the same time that are somewhat cultural.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traveler4k
40,A Different and Compelling Natural History Museum Experience,"Overall, I was very impressed by the Page Museum and the La Brea Tar Pits. Before we visited the museum and tar pits, I didn't quite understand how these two sites are related; I'll describe each separately, touching on that point.Page Museum: At $7.50 for adults, this museum doesn't have quite as steep an admission fee as the Natural History Museum, and the youth fee ($4.50) and child fee ($2.00) are a good deal as well. We spent about an hour in the museum and that seemed to be a good amount of time as it isn't a huge space. The video on the left shortly after you enter the museum is very good at giving an overall idea of the tar pits -- the age of some of the fossils that have been found, what kinds of fossils have been found, how the fossils ended up in the tar, etc. The video was about 10 minutes and helped us understand the rest of the museum and tar pits as we walked through. There is an atrium in the middle of the museum with some greenery and a small pond with turtles and fish. The aim of this atrium seemed to be to show how different life in L.A. was at the time compared to the L.A. that we know now. Also in the museum is a window into the Paleontology lab, where you can see several people at work sorting different fossils found in the tar pits. There was another video towards the end of the museum that was a behind-the-scenes at the museum and excavation sites that was neat as well. Overall, the museum was informative, and I would recommend it to any tourist who has not been there before and wants to get a better idea of what they're looking at in the tar pits. The museum is somewhat aged, however, and it's the kind of place that is worth one visit but not two or three.Tar Pits: I didn't realize before our visit that the tar pits were open to the public -- the park in which the tar pits are located (on the same block as LACMA) is open to the public, and only the Page Museum charges an admission fee. The 'Lake Pit,' which is located along Wilshire Blvd., is very cool because the tar is actively bubbling, which is neat to see. In addition, while we were there, the Pit 91 Viewing Station was open, and that was a very important part of our visit. Pit 91 is a huge tar pit, described on the brochure as ""the longest on-going urban paleontological excavation site in the world"". The excavation has been going on since 1969 and has temporarily been put on pause for 5 - 10 years while staff work on another site that has recently been discovered. At the Pit 91 viewing station, you get a side view of the excavation, where fossils that are the next to be removed are marked with flags. Descriptions of the marked fossils are at the viewing station, along with an employee who can explain the scene and answer any questions.My review got 4 stars instead of 5 because of 2 things: 1) The museum had good exhibits and movies, but there was a definite dated feeling. 2) Originally, when we walked out to the Pit 91 Viewing Station, the employee who was staffing the station was locking up despite the fact that the station was scheduled to be opened for another 45 minutes. He said that his coworker hadn't showed up and he had to return to the museum to find him. We asked if perhaps he could radio the coworker but he said that he'd forgotten his radio. We adjusted our plans so that we went back into the museum and explored there before checking out the viewing station, which turned out to be a good plan in the end, but it was a bit of a disappointment to walk out to the Pit 91 Viewing Station and find that the employee was closing it way ahead of schedule.Overall, I'd say that the Page Museum and La Brea Tar Pits are worth a visit if you're interested in paleontology and science in general. I'd allow around an hour and a half for a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sfka2427
50,What a surprising side trip in Los Angeles,"I had heard of the La Brea Tarpits but never knew exactly where they were. My husband and I were literally driving by and stopped while trying to get to Hollywood (we never did get to Hollywood.) As a teacher, I found this to be an awesome, educational experience. At the museum, we were greeted and asked if either of us was a teacher-yes, I had my CTA card and got in free! How refreshing! My husband was as fascinated as I was about how the food chains are found in the tar. It was also great to see that it is a working site, much more is being discovered there. Don't miss the short, free, movie about the site.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/esteacher
40,Different type of science museum,"Well, I'm kind of a nerd so I really enjoyed the tar pits and museum. Usually I would never bother going to a science museum while travelling cause I figure they're all the same but this one was definately unique. When you come into the park you see the tar pits with life size (or close enough) models of what mastadons look like when they die. We paid the student price which was around $3. I wouldn't have liked paying the full price because the museum was pretty tiny. There were a couple of films about the digs and how the animals were trapped and entire food chains would be captured together. For example they would find a horse that got stuck, the saber tooth cat that got stuck trying to eat the horse, the wolves that tried to eat them both and the vultures that came to eat all the remains. There was a whole wall of wolf skulls and lots of skeletons as well as an area where you can watch the lab workers cleaning fossils etc. A very popular exhibit for children is a big (closed) tub of tar where you can feel how hard it would be to pull various sized objects out of the pits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/csylviareed
40,"Good, geeky break from amusement parks","This is the one place in L.A. I had never visited, and I finally decided to take my 6 yr. old son on our recent visit. It is interesting and fun.Actually going to the Pit 91 excavation site is what makes if so worthwhile (although we didn't know it closed 1 and a half hours earlier than museum). There are not a lot of actual fossil excavation sites that are so easy to access. A good educational opportunity for kids and adults. (Note this is not a dinosaur trip, as the tar pits weren't around that far back.)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CaroSanJose
50,"Mammoths and tigers and tar pits, oh my!","The Page Museum is one of my favorite places in Los Angeles. It does often seem to be overlooked, but it really shouldn't be. It's awesome, has a friendly and knowledgeable staff, and is really unique.Visitors to the Page Museum will discover an impressive array of fossils of Ice Age animals who met their ends in the tar pits. There are complete skeletons of mammoths and sabre-toothed tigers, as well as myriad other fun and frightful creatures.One of the fun things about this museum is that many of the skeletons and fossils are positioned in such a way that you can approach them and view them up close from multiple angles. There is also a ""please touch"" table with real fossils for the curious.Another plus for this museum is that it's small enough to be manageable, but large enough to be worthwhile. Even small kids seem able to get through all the exhibits without getting tired or overwhelmed, but adults will find plenty of fascinating material too. The circular floor plan also makes it impossible to get lost.The tar pits are, of course, right outside the museum, and are still bubbling away. Be careful when walking around them--as the fossils in the museum could attest, falling in would not be a positive experience. One of the pits is open for excavations on a seasonal basis. If you arrive in the off-season, you can still get a glimpse of some of the ongoing work inside the museum: one of the fossil laboratories is adjacent to the exhibition floor and is viewable through a glass window.In all, this is definitely a worthwhile experience, even if fossils aren't normally your thing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anonymousreviewer10
40,An nice side trip,"I've been to LA many times but had never been to the tar pits or Page Museum. My two sons ages 7 and 10 found it as interesting as their parents. Neither were too much into dinosaurs or bones before the visit but we spent an hour or so inside looking at displays and then another half hour outside sticking sticks into the mini tar pits or running around the larger pits. If you are a member of your local Children's museum or science center, they are a reciprical museum and we got in for free showing our membership card of our local science museum. An added bonus....they were filming ""Land of the Lost"" on March 25th there and Will Ferrell was 50 feet from us. Lots of trailers and production crew.....a freebie and more exciting than the Warner Brothers studio tour the day before!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ttoo
50,Unmissable part of pre-history,"I really don't know why the La Brea Tar Pits aren't more well-known and more visited. I have been may times over the years, and everytime I go I find it more fascinating. I have just had the pleasure of taking my 7 and 9 year olds for the first time, and they were completely fascinated and engrossed by this place. There are actual excavations currently on-going, so you can then see all that history in action. The museum is small but perfectly laid out, the film presentations are excellent. The mechanized mammoths may seem a little hokey to an adult, but my kids were enthralled with them, and everything they saw for that matter. What they truly loved was seeing real Saber tooth cat skeletons, and wooly mammoths, and all sorts of extinct creatures, and the working laboratory, and all the related stuff, and then going out the door and seeing and smelling the tar pits right there, as nature created them, not as Disney would have. This place ranks in my top ten of natural wonders, and if you look at my travel map, you will see that I have done considerable world travelling, so that is saying something. Don't miss it!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lindagaf
50,Great place,Definately a must see when you come with the kids. It's an inexpensive way to have fun with the kids. We actually went there the last day we were in town beofre we had to catch our flight. My son really enjoyed it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tanja39
50,"Fun, educational, go on the free tour","We thought we'd see dinosaurs and put our hands in goo, but instead enjoyed a fascinating oasis of ice age history in the middle of LA. No dinos, but saber tooth cats (not tigers) and mastodons. No hands-on goo, except in the gift shop, but a chance to struggle with a mechanism stuck in asphalt. Whole family liked it, from age 5 to 44.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RoadTrip19Mom
50,Slippery when wet!,What a great place!Totally educational with amazingly preserved sabre toothed cats and dire wolves.See both short films in the museum as they are both very interesting and fun!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AVVToronto
40,Dinosaurs and Tar! Oh My!,"In the few days that I was in LA, one of the places I had to see was the La Brea Tar Pits. I'd heard about them for years and decided that this was a must do. Luckily, I wasn't disappointed. The Page Museum was great. For anyone who is a dinosaur lover or has kids that are into dinosaurs (or maybe you're just a kid at heart), I highly recommend this. You can see the full size skeletons of a prehistoric bison, camel, horse, wooly mammoth, various birds, saber tooth tigers and more. There is a wall full of Dire Wolf skulls. There's a glassed off area where you can watch the workers as they clean, sort and organize the various fossils (unfortunately we were there late in the day and didn't get to see anyone working though). There are cross sections of what they think the tar pits look like with all the fossils and debris in them. Outside, you can walk the grounds and see some of the actual tar pits. It was hard to believe we were in the middle of LA. The only downside of the trip was getting there. In my research before the trip, I'd read 3 different things about where the tar pits were on Wilshire Blvd. Once we figured out the public transportation and got going in the right direction, we ended up getting off the bus one stop too early. Do not get off the bus at La Brea Park. Get off at Fairfax stop on Wilshire Blvd. You'll still have to walk a short distance to the park, but it's not as bad as walking from La Brea Park. We learned that the hard way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/infringerd
50,Really interesting stuff,Recently visited the tar pits and Page Museum. Found it absolutely fascinating. You can see a tar pit which they are currently excavating. There are flags in place highlightng specific bones that they are digging up. A guide will explain to you what type of bone and animal it pertained to. The exhbits in the museum and the film are interesting to. They have a number of skeletons on display. It is shocking to see how big some of the animals were back then. Very interesting place. Dont miss it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/laulex
50,Great for free.,"I had wanted to go to the museum since I was a little kid and recetly had the good fortune to go. For those who do not know admission to the museum is free on the first Tuesday of every month. It still costs $6 to park and whatever it costs you to get there (rental car taxi etc).The museum is small, we saw everything including two movies in less than two hours. It is kind of sad because there are a lot of skeletal remains taken from the tar pits so it begs the question, where are they?The videos explain the reason for the smell (Sulphur Dioxide) and I didn't really think the petroleum or Sulphur smell were to overpowering. It was a nice place for a picknick. There is a really good smelling pizza place across the street also if your not in a picknicking mood.The kids loved the skeletons (more than I expected) If you or your kids are fans of the movie Ice Age you see a lot of skeletons from the animals in the movie. There are a few interactive displays that are fun to play with and make sure you at least catch the second newer movie (and the bloopers).We also went out to the pit being excevated and the guide there was very informative. They only do excavation in the summer due to funding issues, but you can still look at where they are excavaing in the winter.Another nice thing is that it is next door to the LA museum of modern art (which is free admission on the second Tuesday of the month) and close to the Natual History Museum (which is free the first Tuesday of every month), Hollywood, Beverly Hills, and for all you Dr D. fans Pico and Sepulveda.Had a great time and would reccomend it. And if you can't go on a free day, it goes to a good cause.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wallofvoodoo
50,Excellent value overall,"Lots of gooey tar pits with an excellent museum explaning all about fossils and bones found in the tar pits. Prices are inexpensive. Gasses bubble up from the tar constantly, providing lots to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adviso
40,Worth visiting,"Had put this off from my last tirip to LA and was glad I made the effort to go this time. Take a walk around the grounds too, interesting stuff.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelChick78
10,It smells real bad,"This place smells realy bad becuase they water down the tar pits! You can't even have a picnic there becuase there is tar oozing out of the ground!Don't even bother going there! It is not worth looking at a couple of bones for a price! I went here for a field trip! This place is recommended for people who can stand the smel!Also, it is really nasty that around the trashcans there is tar coming out of it. Please don't take kids here because they would probably start crying from being so bored!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wander34994
30,interesting,"the tar pits are outside, so at least walk through the park and take a picture in front of the tar pits if you don't want to spend the $7 to go inside the museum. Inside the museum it is small, they show a short movie, and you can see paentologists at work. Overall interesting and unique.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bostravelerBoston
20,needs more,"Needs more what can I say I brought my husband here 2 months ago,he grew up in MI and heard great things about the Tar Pits, he was disappointed, I had been there many times and knew it is lacking something in the past I was hoping that it got better from the last time I was there 15 yrs ago",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FarAway37512
30,Nothing spectacular,"Not bad museum, but don't expect anything spectacular. It was a very quick walkthru. My seven year old and I were kind of disappointed with it. They start off the tour with a cheezy 15 min or so video about how it happened.The Elephant out front is really cool looking..would make a great photo Op.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TxGrrl
50,Childhood Dream Come True!,"I've wanted to go to the fabled La Brea Tar Pits since I saw mummified sabre tooth tiger found there at the Museum of Natural Historyu in NYC as a little kid. The darkly threatening name and the sad tale of prehistoric critters trapped in sticky tar for all eternity made it a pretty evocative place. Even Phoebe Zeitgeist from the Evergreen Review comic strip was going to meet her doom there, dropped from a helicopter... Far from being a miasmatic swamp, the Tar Pits are a very nice park on the grounds of the LA County Museum. You can see a few open excavations where paleontologists are still working 90+ years after the initial discovery, hang out by a pond that bubbles ferociously as methane and tar rise to the surface and check out the LA art museum, the tar pits fossil museum, and a folk art museum right across the street. Tar is still bubbling up out of ground in a few areas like it's Jed Clampett's back 40. A very nice park in the middle of LA with a lot of history and things nearby to do. Best of all, there's a parking lot! Totally cool in all kinds of ways- one of best being the stunned look on peoples faces when they ask ""Where'd ya go?"" and you respond ""The La Brea Tar Pits!"".",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Odyssey25409
30,"Educational, Interesting, but not Riviting","We went on a museum tour, saw a film and went on a walking tour of the grounds--due to time constraints, weren't able to read all the information in the displays. I wasn't expecting a high tech, full of thrills kind of place. It was none of those things, but I learned a great deal and plan to bring my kids back. I think that it is facinating to see in person the many creatures that lived in the USA that we really know nothing about from our science classes in school.Good for reminding us that many creatures can be lost forever if we don't take care of our planet. This is a great spot if you enjoy science and history. If you are not a museum person, you probably won't get into it. I worked at the Smithsonian, so I personally enjoyed it.My husband is really into science so he even wants to go back again and read all the displays.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cybertraveler
40,Interesting Gage Museum,"The Page Museum had exhibits of the skeletons of prehistoric animals such as sloughs, dire wolfs, extinct camel, saber-tooth cat, and mastodons. The tar pits were interesting (a lake of tar). The Japanese Pavillion had many Japanese artifacts, sceens, and artwork. We did not have time to see the L.A. County Art Museum, but did see one special exhibit of Madiglioni. Farmer's Market is about 1.5 miles from the La Brea Tar Pits. We had lunch there and then went to the Grove (within walking distance of Farmer's Market) where there are many upscale shops and a movie theatre. There is a free trolley at the Grove in case the visitors are unable to walk for hours. This was a very interesting one-day trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Camper35820
10,Boring,"No offense to George C. Page, but in my opinion it was boring. When I pulled the tar up and down, it amused me for about 30 seconds. I don't recommend it to many people, unless you are a paleontologist or extreme science freak (and you have a good docent.).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Seaside20441
