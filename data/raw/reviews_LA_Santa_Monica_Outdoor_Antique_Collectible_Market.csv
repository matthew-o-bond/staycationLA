30,Not what it used to be,"Used to come here about 15 years ago as part of my circuit including rose bowl, Long Beach and Pasadena city college. it was smaller than the others but good quality variety of merchandise. Unfortunately it seems to have really declined. Smaller than before with many empty spaces. Shame cause it used to be fun to find things you didn’t know you wanted or that they even existed. Can’t do that on eBay. Don’t know if the others that I used to frequent have experienced the same downturn but Hope they can bring it back.",Pennie F
20,Skip this one,Based on the website and advertisements that I've seen I was expecting a lot more furniture and quality and teaks. But we found were a lot of borderline trash collectibles for a very niche market. Don't come expecting to find furniture or paintings for your nice home.,Matt K
50,Been there many a time.,"What can be better, California sun and cheap junk. Actually there was some pretty nice stuff and whether buying or not it's still fun to walk around . Bring some cash as most don't take cards",Robert L
40,"Small but good flea market, friendly folks","A fun day out, took about 1 hour and 1/2 to do at a leisurely pace. A few really good dealers and some typical flea market folks but at least a lot of it was old. Really enjoyed myself and everyone was so friendly and helpful. Not a lot of food vendors so come prepared. Although there was a lovely restaurant near by called the Spitfire Grill was had some great sandwiches, etc. I would definitely go again!!",AuntTink
