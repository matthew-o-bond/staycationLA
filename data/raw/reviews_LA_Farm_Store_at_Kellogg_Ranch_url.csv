50,Great place for local plants,"Almost always a great variety of vegetables, fruit trees and vines, ornamentals, and succulents.

Earlier this year, we picked up a couple of papayas, which are thriving and should begin bearing fruit in another couple of months. When peppers were the feature, I picked up two different ""heatless"" jalapeno plants that are now loaded with lots of tasty peppers.If you've never been here, make the effort!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/774maxh

50,A Hidden Gem in Pomona,"We weren't sure what to expect from a self-proclaimed farm store adjacent to Cal Poly, but we were definitely impressed! It's loaded with fresh produce, much of which is grown on campus (labels tell you if it is) and some of which is unique (I had never before seen zucchini that is green on one end and yellow on the other). They also have a small deli and a cold case full of drinks, dairy and eggs. The fresh squeezed OJ was phenomenal, and prices were very reasonable. They also have a large selection of Cal Poly-branded snacks and other items along with an opportunity to bottle your own honey. Out in back is a nursery with plants, clearly labeled, with an emphasis on fruits and vegetables. After we left we continued driving up past the store and saw much of the orchard and farm areas that, we assume, supply the store. All in all, it's definitely worth a stop if you are in town or just driving by on the freeway.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OnTheRoadNow

50,I Stop by Every Time I am in Town,"I just love shopping at Cal Poly Pomona's Farm Store. Most of the produce sold is grown on campus. It is very fresh, and reasonably priced. A head of lettuce is $1 and sometimes they are so large that you can't even fit it into one of the produce bags! Broccoli and cauliflower heads (3 different colors!) are .99 a pound. The selection varies depending on the season, but whatever they have is always good. The lone exception is the celery--I have purchased that twice and it is always bitter. Every so often, they have pick your own strawberries for $3 a basket, and you can't get fresher than that. Maui onions you pull yourself from the fields are $1. The store sells their own brand of Salsas. I have tried most of them, and they were all delicious, although a bit pricey. Be sure to pick up a frequent shopper card. After 6 purchases, you get 15% off your 7th purchase.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mom_of_Alex
