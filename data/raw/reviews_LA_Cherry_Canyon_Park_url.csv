40,An easy walk and splendid view on a clear day,"Cherry Canyon is adjacent to Descanso Gardens in La Cañada-Flintridge just off of Hampstead Road and part of the San Rafael Hills. Verdugo Mountain lies immediately to the west across the Glendale Freeway. The trails are well groomed unless you venture onto one of the drainage channels, which some people use as a shortcut but they're steep with poor footing. I would recommend staying on the trails.The vegetation along the trails is mostly chaparral but in the lower reaches of the park near Hampstead Road there is a pretty grove of overarching trees that shades a gully with a small stream. Trail markers are posted at points where the footpaths intersect. There is a fire watch tower and radio relay station at the top of the hill. From this vantage point you have a wide panoramic view of the northeastern part of the San Fernando Valley, with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory prominently visible. In the opposite direction you have a view of Glendale all the way to the Hollywood Hills. This view could be spectacular to take in a nice sunset. The view toward downtown Los Angeles is mostly obstructed, although the tops of a few of the skyscrapers are visible.Free parking is available at the entrance on Hampstead but be careful not to park on the private drives nearby. I did not see a trail map at the entrance. You might consider printing one before visiting, although some phone map apps do show the trails. However, being surrounded on all sides by suburbia, it would be difficult to be lost for long. I saw people with mountain bikes, off-leash dogs and evidence of horses, too. There must be occasional coyotes in the park, so keep dogs close, especially small ones.Overall, it's a good urban hike that would be easily accessible for most people in the northern suburbs of LA such as Burbank, Glendale, La Cañada and Pasadena.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M0stly_Business
