50,Fun place to visit,"A group of us celebrated our friend’s birthday at this place, and we were all dressed up in 1920s attire and watched a good burlesque show. My husband and I did not get a chance to do some tasting at their distillery, but will need to try that next time. It’s an intimate venue so you’ll get a good view anywhere you choose to sit or stand. I would recommend this for an exciting evening for couples or with a group of friends.",Gr8Gem8
50,Great little venue!!!,This is one of my favorite spots to go to. Love the Vandal Vodka. Make sure you go when Del Guido is playing.,962vallim
50,Relaxing afternoon/evening,"Really neat place to go hang out for a special cocktail made out of their own distillery -- or my preference Hitman Ale from Rob's craft brewery! Also, tune in for monthly special events -- they're tops!",KelvinPkellyKemp
50,Small Town Speak Easy serving locally brewed beer and cocktails - Excellent!!,We took the distillery tour and gained great information on this unique small town brewery and distillery. Friendly staff and a nice speak easy lounge. Currently no food served but we were encouraged to bring our own. A musician was present and the music and cocktails were great. A unique spot to gather!,Quilterz
50,Very cool place to visit,"4 of us took the tour and tasting. It took about an hour. Rob Ruben explained a lot of things to us. We started out with a beer to walk around the distillery. Then after the tour we tasted Rum, Vodka, and an $40 a 1/2 bottle bourbon. Everyone was great.We then have the LA Mule to drink in the bar area which has a 1920's theme. It was delicious and gave me a buzz. Their version of a Moscow mule.",Robert7772015
50,Pleasant surprise...,"To find a place w a brewery and distillery as most places nationwide can only choose one. My friend loves the beer, I had the white whiskey. Was very young as expected with a huge blast of corn at the end. They also distill rum and vodka, with their first bourbon out in August. Can't wait to return.No food other than snacks, and a very small spot. But I can't wait to take the tour.",David G
50,"""Speakeasy,"" kind of.","Fun little tasting room that might be hidden from people who aren't locals. Try the ""hitman on caffeine,"" a beer aged with locally roasted coffee beans and topped with cold brew coffee.",Timothy
50,Exellent service,Friendly bar with service minded staff and excellent tasting beer as well as spirits. Recomend a visit!,Jonatan M
50,Unique Bar,Very relaxing atmosphere. This is such a great place for a beer or cocktail alone or with friends. The owners and staff are very friendly.,Diane L
50,Really cool place for a date or happy hour,"This place is cool! You enter from the side-street and go through the brewing and distilling area between the distilling equipment and stacks of oak whiskey barrels. Then through a door with one of those peep-hole windows, like in the movies. That leads you into the beer and liquor tasting room, which has a cozy lounge vibe. It's chill, low lit lighting, and old school with an upright wooden piano and old-style lamps, couches and chairs. It looks like a speakeasy hidden in the back of a warehouse or under a storefront or something from the prohibition era.They have all kinds of craft beer on tap (2 or 3 different IPAs when I went). There were some strawberry, coffee, peanut butter, and even grapefruit flavored beer. I think there are different experimental craft brews each week. All of which can be sampled in little 4oz glasses sort of like a make-your-own flight of craft beer.I didn't make it over to the liquor bar this time, but they have a selection of whiskey, gin, vodka drinks.Over all, it's a cool place for a happy hour or date night. I think they do brewery and distillery tours as well, if you are into that.",JL2020
50,Unique brewery,"Unique brewery with a ""speakeasy"" vibe. Very cool! Beautiful wood bar and nice comfy couch and club chairs gives the place an intimate feel. Oh yeah...the beer is great too.",Hairup
40,Unique brewery and bar experience,Went for drinks with a group of friends and after struggling to find the entrance we were pleasantly surprised by the interior and beer selection. No apparent food on the menu. Nice clean bathrooms.,Nash W
40,Craft Brew and soon to be distillery,"We dropped in here one Saturday afternoon after the bartender at Rock and Brews told us about the opening. Great spot in the smoky hollow area with a speak easy feel just like the other reviewers have mentioned. The distillery part was not operating yet, why only the four stars for this non beer drinker, the friendly bartenders explained that is what the second bar area is for in the tasting room once up and running. Looks like they will distill more then one thing too for some cocktail variety. Tasting room is cozy, can see how once word gets out, it could be packed very quickly/easily. Will be back once the distillery opens, hope to have a new option in the southbay craft beer scene that serves more then just beer for us non beer drinkers to accompany those on the craft brew quest (looking at you El Segundo brewery).",BeachJoan
50,Cool and unique brewery/distillery experience,"Different from breweries in LA with its throw back vibe to the speakeasy times. I can't believe it's LA's only brewery and distillery combo. Try the ""Gun Powder Cream"" beer- it's a citrus beer and a must try!!",rubyred_hkr
50,Best Speakeasy!,"Great new neighborhood jem! Short walk from the El Segundo area or an easy Uber/Lyft drive to this location from Santa Monica, Venice Beach, Westchester, or the South Bay. New beer and spirts ""speakeasy"" style tasting room with amazing 1920s Prohibition Era decor. Dark wood, dim lights, plush couches and chairs with great friendly bar staff dressed in black & white with numbered name tags serving some great new beers for now and spirts soon to come. As authentic as you can get with an unadvertised, got to know someone feel to it. The building is located on the corner with traffic flow off of El Segundo and customer entrance off Bungalow. Don't miss out on this new place.",nofearfd
50,Brewery and Distillery Tasting Room,"Best new brewery and tasting room around! Very cool ""prohibition era"" decor that goes right along with the great beer. Enter through the side door in true speakeasy style, the single red light fixture indicates the entrance. Interesting and tasty flavors like grapefruit cream ale, coffee stout, and a strawberry wheat ale are my favorites. If your headed to the beach cities, head through El Segundo and stop and check out Rubens Brewery Distillery.",Jason F
