50,Peaceful,"I drive past this church all the time and about six months ago they opened the doors daily to go in and pray or just sit quietly. It's a beautiful old church, built over 100 years ago. It's a hidden gem in Glendale. Every so often they have a Saturday night evensong presentation with songs from contemporary artists followed by a wine and cheese reception (yes, real wine). I stop in sometimes as an oasis as it is peaceful and quiet inside and allows for contemplative thinking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S5357RZlauram
