40,Gentle and quant,"this recently redone corner of the pacific is a perfect place for a relaxing afternoon, especially if you have kid. There is a parking lot and street parking, a playground, bathrooms and a place to get snacks. It is a tucked away gem.",Sandra D
40,Great Place for Little Ones,"Pay for parking or free street parking when available. Easy for kids to Wade in the water, launch a paddle board or kayaks. Play equipment available too. Bathrooms are available and about as clean as a public Beach restroom can expected. Shore is relatively clean. Gets busy during summer months.",Jennifer S
50,Place where kids can have fun,"As implied by the name, mother's have been taking their kids to this tranquil beach for generations.",Dana Los Angeles
40,Great for families with small children,I have a 2 year old who won't go in the water at any other beach by here. Water is calm and great for small children. It's if a huge beach so it does get filled up. There are lots of restrooms and outdoor showers onsite. As well as a nice playground. Lifeguards on duty so feels safe. We even saw a seal but unfortunately was too late to take a picture.,Samuel H
20,hotday,"is not like what I am expect, beach without wave, family spent for summer time, bring all your personal belonging, expensive parking , not too clean, is okay for family with young children to play in the beach, just for an hour and we leave this place",liarosse
50,Perfect Baby Beach,The parking is a little messy if your not patience. We enjoyed the clean beach and the life guards were covering everything felt really safe.,Chase Carver
40,Mothers Beach,"A nice beach for small children located near the 2nd street bridge. Located on the marine stadium, which was a venue for the Olympics in years past. The calm surf makes it ideal for small children to play in the water. Parking can be problematic so plan wisely.",BobandMargie G
50,Great Beach,What a great beach to spend your day. It's so nice to have a place to go to take the grandchildren on a warm day. The beach is wonderful and within walking distance to 2nd street to grab a bite or pick up something for a picnic on the beach.,ginahicks921
50,Great spot for families,"Nice bay with ""toys in the sand"" for the kids to climb and play on. There is sand and calm water in the bay. Also, there are clean bathrooms at Mother's Beach.",Rosemary S
50,A beautiful family gem,"Californians love their beaches. Like trout fishers they also have their secret, favourite locations. Called Mothers Beach, this a real pearl of a beach for families with small children.It hides away behind a Coast Guard facility, but is a white sand, swimming beach with toilets, grills and tables.The last time we were there we had the whole place to ourselves. The water is shallow and protected so there are no waves. Small children can splash all they want.Parking can be interesting as the small lot seems to be filled up by people who are not on the beach. (Where were they?). Don't even think of parking in the Coast Guard spaces! But street parking is available and the walk is easy.Sure, this is not open ocean, but it absolutely works for children and parents wanting to just sit and watch.Lovely!",367john
30,Good spot for fun,The Marine Park at Mother's Beach is a nice spot to spend some family time while visiting Redondo Beach. It is a good spot for fun and sun near the ocean.,buffalojim67
30,Family Beach,"This is where you see all the families at. It's the beach for kids. Water is calm and there is playground equipment for the kids as well. They have grills set up as well. Much shade too with all the trees,",dalesr214
40,Kids day out....,Great place for the young ones to play on the water and sand. Beach has its own playground and activity center for the kids. You can buy food in the kiosk but better to bring your own food and picnic set-up under the trees. Good green grass and cool shaded area. Lots of parking space but weekends will surely be a problem. No barbecuing allowed and no pets allowed in the beach. Has plenty of open showers and restrooms. Has free parking along the road and timed pay parking provided. Should come early on weekends to get a good spot. Suggest to survey the place before making any plans.,Drokis0301
50,Best beach for Toddlers,"I adore Mother's Beach! My 3 and 5 year old boys love to swim in the flat, protected water and play on the sandy beach and playground all summer long. My favorite family beach ever! And they love the ice cream truck that hangs out in the parking lot throughout the busy hours of summer too. :)",Lindsay S
30,"Pleasant spot while school is in, but sting ray ruined our visit.","We visited Mother's Beach while visiting CA in April 2016. Street parking and free space on the sand were very easy to find on a weekday when school was in session, and while our son who loves the sensation of trying to ""jump"" waves was a bit disappointed by the still waters of the protected waterway, it was easy to see why the spot is so popular with other parents with young children. The playground is very nice, and bathrooms are easily accessible. The bathrooms provided some minor challenges, because while they were fairly clean for beach bathrooms (I grew up not far away and have seen some rather ghastly beach facilities in my years), the lights either were not maintained or not turned on in the individual unisex large stalls, so the only light available came from the six inch or so gap under the door, making it nearly pitch dark even at noon. The real challenge for us, however, was that my husband had been in the water only about 5 minutes and only up to his shins when he was stung by a stingray. We did not realize what had happened, exactly, until his bleeding foot began turning purple and the pain was increasingly severe, because we could not find anyone manning the lifeguard station there by the restroom building to ask for help or advice. We ended up at Urgent Care, and out of the water. It really put a damper on the day. The one mercy was that it had not been our kids stung. I am not sure we would risk a repeat performance from local marine life!",Nikki J
50,Wonderful time with Grandchildren!,"Brought four kids here, ages 7 - 13, and everyone had a great time. Besides the water fun (calmer than the ocean so more worry free), there is a playground, concessions, bathrooms and outdoor showers to get the sand off!! Get there before 10 am for a spot in the parking lot. Metered parking is only $1 an hour!",Kathleen H
40,Great alternative to the ocean; limited parking. Bring a picnic!!,"My neighbor and I met up with an old college friend of mine at Mother's Beach. The parking is limited, but we were luckily able to find parking on the streets nearby. Just be prepared to drive around for a little while to find something.My friend is a member of a club that keeps outriggers and paddleboards at Mother's Beach, so we had access to these at the beach. The beach was clean, but definitely got more crowded as the afternoon wore on. We were there on a weekend when the temps hit the mid-90's, which is not often there. The beach provides a nice alternative to the ocean, since there are not waves. There are areas for swimming marked off by buoys, and the waterway is a 5 MPH no-wake zone. Lifeguards are on duty and they do warn boaters going through the area too fast.There is no food at the beach or nearby, so bring a picnic and a cooler! There are public restrooms, though we didn't venture into them, so can't review those.",Marianne R
30,Great Location......Yet.,"The location of this part is nice...yet there is no parking. So be prepared to park on very narrow residential streets and walk! If there is an event, you will walk a very long way. The venue has only porta potties, so be prepared.",insight2actions
40,Nice family spot.,"Went here with my daughter and grandsons.. Nice parking (metered) very family friendly spot. Play ground, consession stand, nice bathrooms.",abakerPS
30,Overrated,Took my four kids here to play for a day and left disappointed. Not much as far as play equipment goes for 2 year olds. We went on a Saturday and it was super packed. Seems like there are a lot of nice parks around Long Beach to choose from I'm not sure why this one is so highly recommended for families.,Jaymarti
50,Great for Small Children,A nice small beach that is a favorite of mothers with small children. The inlet has no waves or currents and no drop offs in the water. You can relax with small children and it is easy to keep an eye on them. It is a nice crowd of people that go there.,PatrickLongBeach
50,Perfect for a visit ... Play in the water or on the land,Mother's Beach is a perfect place to relax. Bring the whole family. Everyone will be happy.You can walk or swim. There are no waves.Everyone is friendly.,gmeredith
50,"Sand, sea, swimming, playground, this has it all!","Great family beach and park. Great for picnics on the grass under shady trees. Designated swim area with very little waves and lifeguards in summer. Restrooms, showers,street and metered parking. Movies on the beach in summer.",Diane J
40,No waves,"went here all the time as a kid, bc there are no waves in the water. Bring the kids. There are also kayak rentals on the sand.",Fernando J
40,"Not at the beach, but very nice","Check the map to see that it is called Mothers beach, but it is NOT at the beach. Plenty of parking (fee) or street parking. Save environment with park like setting and no waves. If you are lucky they have action on the water. this place is a fun day for little kids and their Mothers at anytime. A small caf√© is at the water and offers a nice setting with breakfast and more. Recommended for the little once. MeuterMedia",MeuterMedia
40,A kid's beach,the only thing wrong with Mother's Beach is that as soon as school is out ; it is very crowded.The kid's playground is very new and safe. the rest room facilities are well kept and also relatively new.A snack shack is located on the premises near the playground.Parking is scarce and expensive.,murjoe
50,Fun for the family,"Small , family oriented beach in sheltered waters. The beach is clean, with ample rest rooms which are well maintained. There is a kids play area, a small restaurant and ample parking. You will need to pay to park and times when this is enforced vary so make sure to check the signs. Pay machines take quarters or credit cards. On the weekends it gets busy starting early morning so you will need to get there early to claim your spot.",LJB610
20,Kids and Family Kind of Beach,"My wife and I visited. Just walked around a few minutes and left. Definitely a ""kids and family"" kind of beach (hence the name of course). Yuck",ericruns66
40,Perfect for the family,"You should have seen the crowds of families at Mother's Beach on Memorial Day. Lots of umbrellas, coolers, beach toys, and sun tan lotion! A great time was had by all in the gently flowing waters. Great for little kids too! Playground equipment is available for those not wanting to swim....but who doesn't want to go in the water when it's 90 degrees out? Great family fun!",ryanroost
30,"Nice, but wave free","Staff at our hotel recommended this beach. It was a nice relaxing place to bring the kids, but we were disappointed that there were no waves. If that's what you're looking for you'll probably like it. We are from Utah and don't have oceans and so we really wanted to play in the waves. They did have kayaks, paddle boards,etc. to rent. We went there at about 6 pm and there was plenty of parking and it wasn't too crowded.",mlaurie24
50,Hubby's former high school hangout,Hubby used to spend a lot of time here as he grew up in Long Beach. This was his high school hangout and he has fond memories of it. We stop here every time we visit family so he can reminisce.,Angel1217
50,Wave free,What a Wonderful beach to bring the kids. No waves and lots of shoreline. They even rent paddle boards and kayaks. The street is completly blocked off so parking was a little difficult. We dropped off grandpa and kids and all the beach stuff and searched for a place to park. 15 minutes later we were in the water having fun.,gccamp
30,Busy beach with shady trees and grass,"If you're making a day trip to Long Beach with the kids, then you might want to consider going to Mother's Beach. But beware, get there early to find a place to park in the parking lots( some metered) and find a good spot on the beach or on the grass. The great thing about this beach is that there IS shade available for those who don't want too much sun. There's no waves here, just a safe calm roped off swim area for the kids, with lifeguards in the summer months. There's also plenty of bathrooms, and a great little playground. And on the far end of the beach is Mom's Beach House restaurant which has take out as well as tables and chairs along the water and under the shade trees. Many families bring their own BBQs and make the day of it. There are plenty of trashcans and it looked like people were being thoughtful and using them too. It's a great beach to take the kids....but it can get pretty busy!",boloca
50,beach day,great place to spend the day with kids. no traffic and easy access. great for little ones and adults,rlipschutz
