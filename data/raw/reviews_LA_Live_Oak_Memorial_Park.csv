40,Just visiting my Nephew Grave,"My nephew died in Car Crash in May 07 2017 in Los Angeles. I could not attend his funeral as I was outside USA. I visted his grave last month on 10 June 2017 and pray for his departed soul. It was basically grave yard for all religion. Muslim community had separated their graveyard from the main complex. It was really a nice grave yard,calm & quite with natural look. You really feel emotional once you are there,it raise aquestion automatically to your mind that it is a final destination...Everyone has to come here. No escape. After that I visited that place several time...",AHM N
