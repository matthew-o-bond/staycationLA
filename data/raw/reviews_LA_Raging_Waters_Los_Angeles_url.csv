50,Nice place,Raging Water Los Angeles is a fun place. I was there this summer. I can take my grandchildren there. We can swim and play together. There are many attractions. We rode many water slides. We can walk in the lazy river if we don’t want to swim. I’d recommend this place to others because every family can play and swim together and especially in the summer.,christiane vally
50,Review,H2go is an amazing experience. You have a lot activities here. The team is great and they help you with everything. And the prices are low.,Neza
50,Review,H2go is a very good thing in a Spain if you want to do some activities. The team is kind and the tours and activities are amazing. It is something that you must do if you visit Sevilla.,Sara M
10,PAINFUL EXPERIENCE!,"I love water parks. This is the first one - where the water felt like it's zero degrees everywhere in the park. It was so cold my son complained and didn't want to do most of the rides. It's freezing to the point it's painful. Especially the kids rides. They're even colder and most kids just want to leave after a few minutes there.I saw a young woman drown in the tidal pool. I think she simply froze there and needed the life guard to shut the tidal pool and jump into the water and save her.The staff don't care and allow long lines to run without trying to help move things along. It almost feels like they want the lines to become longer as they work so slow moving people into the various rides.The food stands are disgusting. There's like dozens of bee's attacking everyone sitting at the tables and when I was there - twice on a weekend at around 1:00 pm much of the food was gone. The two ice cream stands I visited had only a handful of flavors left. about 70% of their front ice cream freezers were totally empty like they never even bothered to get any ice cream out of the back freezer. They felt it's enough to allow people to choose between chocolate, Vanilla and Strawberry.The food options are so limited, mostly totdogs, super cheesy pizza and sharky's over fried and greasy food.This is the 21st century -some of us still want our fast food to look like food. There's nothing that even pretends to be healthy like a Burritos , vegiterian hamburger, etc... They also don't allow you to bring food from outside - so you're stuck without food for your kids if you want them to eat something that doesn't taste like burnt grease.Even the Dippin dots only had 3 of the many flavors they advertised on their poster.Not sure what's going on with this place. Felt like they kind of wanted visitors to not want to return.Bummer cause they're so close to LA and if they just got their act together this place could be heavenly.Maybe instead of constantly promoting their park on Groupon for super cheap - they would just heat the water a bit - so kids and adult won't suffer when they do the rides - and they'll have so much more repeat customers.",dkla2001
30,Summer fun,As always a fun place to except the large crowds. This leads to little space in the shade if any unless you are the first ones there. Now obviously this comes with the territory of a metropolitan city but it is rather frustrating.,Jerry F
10,Dirty and very dated.,"To describe this place as a disappointment is an understatement. How they have the audacity to open the park when so much is closed is beyond me.A significant number of the rides were closed when we first arrived. The lazy river was closed ALL day. Even the main pool was closed for a prolonged period.We were given a range of excuses from broken pumps, to insufficient lifeguards. Either way, this is unacceptable. We had two very young children with us who were confined to one small play area at points due to the lazy river and a pool being closed, and we ended up going home early as we were struggling to keep them entertained.The combination of eight entry tickets, two parking charges, two lockers, as well as food and drink made this an expensive day out, and was definitely not worth it.If they don’t have sufficient facilities/staff to open the park fully, they shouldn’t be open at all.The park felt dirty and dated.There were wasps everywhere, because the cleaning was so poor.Never again.",PhilG-UK1
10,Shocking value for money!,Before I write my comments re this water park I want to confirm I have been to Disney and Universal parks in California and Florida!As a family of five we paid circa $200 to enter the water park. The experience was horrific and during our 6 hours we questioned over an hour for a pizza and each ride requires a queuing time of 50 to 90 mins. With the exception of the generic park pool we managed to go on six water slides in 6 hours.If you’ve spent the money on the queue jump passes you’ll have a great day as the rest of their customers are treated as second class even if we have spent $200!We spoke to the manager and he was crystal clear we should expect about 5 to 6 rides due to the time of the year....$30 to $40 a ride. Hmmm,549ajd
20,Not Good,"Very crowded even on a Wednesday. Lazy river was a mess 50% of people just walking in it. Not enough tubes. Food vendor ""restaurants a huge mess. Pinks hot dogs had no chile ready yet 90 minutes after opening. 90% of their menu comes with chili - go figure. We went to another place and they had no mustard for their hot dogs and told us to go to Pinks and steal some mustard. Bees everywhere. I payed for the kids to have the express pass which helped because the lines were very very very long!!!!",George P
40,Great Visit with Young Kids,"We had a great time with our group of 8 and under kids. Lots of rides for kids 48 inches and above. On a Thursday, lines were short and staff was great. Park was clean and easy to walk around. Parking was close by. Our kids had so much fun. Highly recommend for younger kids. Water was clean and rides well-maintained.Food was expensive but that’s all theme parks. Lockers were centrally located, and you could stash food in there then eat at the picnic tables nearby. The other reviews were correct that bees and wasps plagued the eating areas. No one got stung, but it was annoying.Don’t bother renting a cabana as most of them were empty. Tons of lounge chairs were set up in the shade, ready for visitors to relax.Unfortunately some rides were closed due to lack of lifeguarding. One of these opened later in the day. Some of the food stands were closed too. Still, tons of rides were open and our group enjoyed it.Look online for ticket deals, now and around Black Friday.",J V
10,Yuck.,Dirty. The grounds smell. Lazy river water is so dirty you can barely see the bottom. Bathrooms are stinky and very dirty. Waps and bees every where. Summer help is no help. 45 mins or more wait for a ride. When you only have from 6 hours and you spend most of that in line or going from one consection stand to another because they are out of food is nuts.Raise your price of admission and up grade the place.,pearl g
10,"2 Hour que's for a ride,attacked by wasps !","Worse water park ever been, it took us over an hour to get from the front gate to the car park,when we eventually arrived the ques to go on a slide were 90-120 minutes, we then sat down to eat and got attacked by a swarm of wasps that infest the park.Massively overcrowded,, and groupon vouchers do not work as there is no WIFI in the park !Horrendous place",Joanne F
20,First time visiting park!,"Enjoyed spending family time with my nephews before school starting next week. The rides were fun for both Adults and the kids. I do have to say I was disappointed with the lack of cleanliness, especially the bathrooms, waited 1 hour for four “Dole” icecream cones, very inefficient service. It was EXTRA crowded due to the hot Saturday day. Needs much improvement.",gidrah
20,Poorly managed is an understatement,"Some of the other reviews on here are spot on. Yes, the rides are fun, but this is one of the most awful places I've ever gone to when it comes to how they manage the place. It was a weekday, and the crowds were ok (it wasn't empty but tolerable), but because management is so bad, lines that looked short were ridiculously long. We got in a line for Carl's Jr. thinking it might be about 20-30 minutes. It actually took 50 minutes from the time we paid for our food to the time we were given our food. The ""system"" they had in place was straight out of the 80's, and the poor teenagers filling the orders were getting chewed out every few minutes from customers who were shocked by the wait, but ultimately it wasn't their fault for functioning in such an inefficient way- it's the fault of the people in charge who have set their employees up for failure and abuse from angry customers. This was our experience waiting for Dole soft serve too- a short line took 3x longer than it appeared. The parking is also a joke. It's pretty much cash only with no indication that it is until you've sat in line for 30 minutes to get to a person who tells you that. Bathrooms were dirty, and by the afternoon the water was filthy. Lastly, you probably should plan on buying the fast pass if you have kids because the lines for the slides get really, really long. You also should pay money for a cabana or get there early enough to get a little corner for yourself with a couple lounge chairs because otherwise you'll never find a place to sit outside of the eating area. I wasn't expecting a resort. I realize you get what you pay for. But this water park did not meet the most basic standards one expects in the LA area in the year 2019. I would try the other nearby water parks before going there.",Cookie G
10,Floating diapers,"We visited this past Sunday on a hot summer day. We knew it was going to be packed but still wanted to have fun. While in the kids area I noticed a floating diaper, a diaper on the rocks where the kids play, a strong smell of urine from all directions and a pair of urinated shorts barking in the sun. This place is a joke, and a breeding ground for diseases. Save your money and your health, don't come here.",Nikktothee
20,Needs Some Help,"We went on a Monday. Less people, so lines were not as drastically long. For the price, basically $50 bucks an adult, it’s a toy park to say the least. Mainly a trap for families. Parents, and families, kids, teenagers and babies. Not the best park for respectful guests. Lots of teenagers. Mild music playing in the back ground. Food is super expensive and it’s all terrible junk. Not much to choose from as far as food. With that all said, the slides are the fun part. Waiting in the lines to get your tube to use the slide, not so much fun. They weigh people too, so be aware. If you’re too heavy, you won’t be able to get on the slide, even after you’ve waited an hour in line. Slides could be better, they’re quick and they aren’t many that are extreme thrills. Lockers are between $12 and $15 if you don’t want to leave your stuff laying around in the open, which people were doing. I don’t trust that route but to each their own. Lots of sun around so be prepared. Staff is friendly but non engaging, more like robots. Expect to spend a lot if you have a family or even if you go with friends. Plan earlier to make for a better day. Parking is cash only. Also ZERO alcohol is sold. That was a real bummer. But great time when we did hit the water.",Chris Satterfield
40,Great for a water park!,"First, relax it’s a water park. It’s not Disneyland and don’t expect it to be a 5 star resort. It draws a little different crowd and is not meticulously maintained. That being said we had a great time. Some guests are a little less than desirable or scary looking but everyone was having a good time and never saw 1 problem. Parking is $20 but everywhere is a scam for parking these days. Eat right before the park at the many choices nearby and don’t pay the over priced park prices. At least they have name brand food and not the overpriced standard no name food. A Carl’s Jr. combo is $12-$14. They also have Dunkin Donuts and Pinks hot dogs for somewhat high prices. You can bring in your own water bottles and suggest you do that. Lockers are $10-$12 to rent also. Worth it to us to store water and small snacks we brought. We skipped the fast pass and tube rental, not necessary on a weekday. The review about the weight limit. For 2 people it was a was not 200lbs. It was like 400-500lbs. Maybe more. No normal person needs to worry.",JetSkiRacr1
20,Cool Employees,"This place only gets two stars because the employees are all nice. But the place was slight ghetto from my experience. First, we went here by mistake for a girl scout function that was actually at another park. We showed the parking attendant a parking pass that was not for this park but he let us go in without paying. Mind you, we were still not aware that we was at the wrong park. Then we had wristbands on and told the person at the gate we were there for a girl scout function and did not have to pay to get in and the gate attendant said ok and let us in. We then realized after getting in to the park and calling our troop leader that we were at the wrong park! Oh well, we decided to enjoy ourselves for a few hours before leaving since we were already there. However, it was so hot and the lines were so long we only got on a few rides and spent the rest of the time relaxing in the kiddie area. Some of the water park areas looked run down and then my daughter hurt her head on one of the closed slides. Last the food prices were higher than they should have been and they ran out of cups for slushies. The nice employee did allow us to use our soda cup for the slushie though (What park runs out of cups?)",Exquize
50,Great,It was the best time and me and my friends enjoyed also people of you don’t like long lines go to lunch’s and dinner earlier like lunch at ten and dinner at three thirty or four,Stephine fullington
10,BEES IN Food Area,"I would like to say we had a great time, but it was the worse time I have ever experienced at a water park. We purchased the Family Four pack with Pizza Lunch and stood in the line for over an hour. The area where you eat at when you first come in behind the food places was filled with BEES. I went to guest services to complain about the bees and asked if they could have someone take out the trash. My request was ignored and my husband was stung by a bee. The customer service didn't care one bit. Such a waste of money we were only at the water park for an hour and half.",Sheena511
30,Like comparing Magic Mountain to Disneyland.,"Yes Magic Mountain has better rides than Disneyland, but Disneyland is just managed better. That's the feeling you get when you visit here if you have ever been to Knott's Soak City. Raging Waters has great attractions, but you can tell that the park is not well managed.The first problem we ran into was when the park officially opened up, two whole sections were closed. You could see the confusion and frustration of the guests as to why certain sections were not open, while the rest of the park was. Lack of staff perhaps? But you pay for admission for the whole park, not just some of it. It seemed really odd to have areas closed after official park opening.The second problem was cleanliness. Someone didn't get out the leaf blower before the park opened. Trash and plant debris were a plenty. Not even close to being as clean as Knott's Soak City. Also, do the lazy river early. We did it later in the day, and you could see that the water was milky and full of plant debris. I wasn't surprised that my daughter had ear trouble the next day after visiting.The staff were friendly though. Every employee we encountered were nice and helpful. They also have some slides that are better than Soak City, mainly the slide called High Extreme. It is a huge tower that you have to climb that has a bonus fear element of swaying as you get higher. I had a death-grip on the railing as I reached the top! Great fun, even though I was praying for no earthquake as I waited for my turn.One great slide, The Tunnel of Terror was great fun. We went to do it a second time later in the day...AND IT WAS CLOSED! Another ""What the heck?"" moment. The park was still open for four more hours. Did someone get hurt? Lack of staff? Was the slide broken? There was no one around to ask.Their new Aqua Rocket slide was unique, but we had more fun on other slides than their newest.We still had a fun day, but it will be years until I come back.",Tim S
10,There's $125 I'll never get back again...,"Well, I should have known when their marketing focuses on being ""the biggest waterpark in Southern California"". This place is old, run down, dirty with a bunch of their attractions not working. As I write this, I can't for the life of me figure out why I didn't check TripAdvisor BEFORE we went as the reviews/ratings clearly show what we found out during our trip today.- Lines for rides were ridiculous- Parking is just stupid, almost took longer to get into the parking lot than it took to drive from Studio City- Lazy river shut down- Wave pool with broken wave machine is just a poolWe left after 2 1/2 hours thoroughly disappointed and wishing we had headed to Hurricane Harbour... or anywhere else actually. Save your money and do something, i.e. anything else.",Barry B
30,Awesome day but not very clean and a few issues.,"We took our kids aged 8, 10, and 12 on a weekday. They had a super time overall but we really found the bathrooms, change rooms and general cleanliness an issue. The bathrooms were very bad. We bought a family pass and had a pizza lunch. This was good option and the pizza was good. We were surprised that it wasn't busy but there was still long waits for some slides. I wouldn't want to go on a busier day. The lazy river was closed at first but once open our kids loved that. The wait for slides turned them off a bit. It really didn't compare to other waterparks we love but was still a very enjoyable day. My 8 year old loved just swimming I the river and the kids area. The older kids had fun on a few slides and the wave pool and lazy river. Wear shoes the concrete is hot and go early to get a good spot and parking. You have to pay for parking and online is a better price then at the gate.",kdzmom3
40,Fun for our Teens,"We had a group of 11 of us including 4 teens and 3 younger kids.Positives:- We waited until a weekday right before school to go and it wasn't very crowded. We also got a great online deal.- The teens went on every slide (that was open) and they were very happy- The food choices seemed decent (we ate our lunch in the parking lot and bought snacks in the park - the frozen Dole was a big hit!)Negatives:- Upon arrival the park listed the Lazy River as closed. The younger kids were disappointed but found other things to do and then thankfully the Lazy River opened up at around 2:30. However the big negative is there weren't NEARLY enough tubes for each person so many people were just walking down the the river tubeless with their kids. Considering the park wasn't very crowded, I was surprised at the lack of tubes.- I had read that the park looked like it was on the older side and was a bit dirty and this proved to be true. Particularly the bathrooms.- BRING water shoes or flip flops. The pavement was way too hot to walk barefoot and you do not want to be walking into those bathrooms with bare feet.- Major lack of signage. Mid-day we finally found a big map that was posted in the waterpark but it looks like there was just one. So depending on where you were, you had NO idea where anything was.- Parking is apparently cash only ($15), which I don't think is stated clearly on the Web site.Having said all that, we would probably go again because our teens had so much fun.",Alissa N
40,Keep your Expectation Low,"After reading the different reviews from different site, we set out to have a fun day. The cooler weather brought in less crowd?! It was 95 degrees on a Sunday. We showed up around 11:00 am and there were still parking close to the front. Scored!! And we also scored the last cabana by the prime kiddy area! Cabana KK-01 to Kk-09 is not directly in front of the slide area, so avoid if you can. We got a prime spot, KK-14. Shade in that particular cabana from morning to 6 pm. Well worth the splurge. There was a cracked lounge chair and one missing lounge chair for this particular cabana for this particular day. Poor quality control on the management. We just did without it, too lazy to go seek someone to help. Someone should be at the cabana to make sure everything is there and in good shape for every rental. Whatevers, my standard was VERY low after reading SO MANY complaints. I totally get what others were complaining about. The larger cabana sold out but the 4 people one had plenty of room for 6 of us, it cost $149. Inner tube rentals, $7 ea. We brought in extra chairs and put it out in front of KK-14. Perfect spot to watch the toddlers go down the kiddy slides. Only drawback, no food service to these smaller cabanas. Little do they know how much our group can eat. Food were expensive. So this is the breakdown of what we consumed. Extra Small nachos and burritos cost about the same price, about $13-$15. Combos at Carl's Jr. was the best deal for lots of food. Burger, fries and drink for $13ish. The chili cheese fries were also a good deal in reference to other food - $6. Dippin Dots were good price too - $5ish. Then the funnel cake $13, and 2 more burritos, icee $7 and a spicy hot dog $9. We ate all day. Everyone enjoyed their time. We got tickets for $20 during Black Friday sale and $22 through the localflavor site. Fun day.",Bacong F
50,Water fun!,I took my daughter and her friends to raging waters. She had so much fun. The rides were a blast. Great lazy river. Food choices are limited. Although I did see themMake and effort at diversifying choices. Plenty of desserts thought. From ice cream to funnel cakes. Wish they would stay open just a bit longer. The days ended at 5 but otherwise so fun!,ewoodsmall
20,This place needs work!,"This place is very dated. There’s trash all over, the bottom of the pools are peeling, there’s leaves and debris in all the pools and a few slides and other attractions were closed. We paid extra ($150!) for a private cabana and it was absolutely not worth it. The food is pricey and people working here are rude. Not worth it....",760erins
10,Waste of a day,"The Raging Waters website makes the park seem like an amazing and thrilling water park but this is far from the truth. My partner and I were visiting from Australia and found Raging Waters and from the website it looked pretty fun. We travelled over an hour to get there but it was just a waste of a day.It's apparently California's biggest water park and if that's true then that is sad. The park is very outdated and needs a massive upgrade with bigger and better slides. Slides are old and pretty boring although they're made out to be 'extreme' thrillers.Obviously there are always waits when attending these parks but it just seemed they were getting everyone through the rides so slowly and lines were barely moving. It seems like they need some sort of new system to keep up with the large attendance and better crowd control. On one of the rides there were 2 lines for the same ride, but no employee standing there to advise anyone so one line ended up way longer than the other line as no one knew the lines were for the same ride.We were there for about 2 hours and only managed to get on 2 rides due to the lines. And the slides were disappointing so after going on just 2 rides we just left as couldn't justify lining up for another set of boring slides. I have visited other water parks in Australia and even Asia which run circles around this park and are the same price. Not to mention the place is overrun with bees which make sitting down to eat difficult.So basically don't waste your time with this park. Really wish we didn't waste a day of our holiday here. I usually do not write bad reviews on places unless they are really bad so trust this review!!!",monphill
10,Too expensive for what it is.,"This place is far too expensive for what it is. $15 for parking. Rubbish Cabanas, miserable staff. Have to come out of the water a lot because people like weeing in it so they have to get everyone out. Lot of money for very little. Not organised properly.",Raj_C72
30,Get there early. Stay hydrated. Have fun.,"I read through the bad reviews before going and I still went and had tons of fun. I hadn’t been to Raging Waters since I was a kid and I was excited to go with my boys and their friends. Parents, you need to plan ahead. Have a game plan. We bought discount tickets online. We got there a half hour before they opened. We parked near the front. As soon as we entered the park, we headed to the lounge chairs. I’m glad we did not splurge on the cabanas. They are not worth it. We safely left our towels on 6 lounge chairs for 8 hours. We would meet up back at lounge chairs every couple hours to reapply sunscreen and for lunch. Bring your own water, they don’t seem to be that strict about it. We stored our phones and wallets in a small locker. The longest we waited for a slide was about an hour. The earlier you get there and starting riding slides, the shorter the lines. Did I see some trash on the ground and in random corners when I looked for it? Yes. A few well placed trash cans in the lines would help with that. There were plenty of employees around and I noticed they switched posts often. I don’t think the lifeguards are there to answer questions about season passes and inner tube rental. They’re there to make sure your kid doesn’t drown and to help get you out of an inner tube quickly. For lunch, you can buy a whole pizza. That seems like the best deal and be prepared to wait in line to order it. Raging Waters is what it is. It’s Southern California, you’re going to wait in line for everything. It’s for kids, and teens. Kids don’t notice little things that adults do. Just have fun and stay hydrated. You’re making memories for your kids.",Erin C
10,Should have just gone to the beach....,"Absolute rip off. Totally took the fun out of a family fun day out. Our family of 6 were on holiday from the UK and the kids, aged 9, 13, 16 and 18 opted for the waterpark over Disneyland as they're a bit older, knew it wouldn't cost as much and didn't want to wait for hours in queues for rides.It cost us $280 for one-day general admission tickets as family tickets are only available online and there are no differences in prices regardless of age. There is also a $15 car park fee and a $15 dollar locker fee.We got there at 12pm as we were on holiday so felt no need to get up early and drive there for opening at 10am, we felt that 6 hours should be sufficient. During this time we managed to have lunch and get on 3 slides as queues were at least 45 mins per ride. All of the main rides require floats and the staff worked with very little enthusiasm to move things faster. We asked 3 members of staff throughout the park about closing times, queue times, fast track bands etc and they were all clueless and unhelpful.After ride two the kids were getting overly frustrated and so we went to the fast track booth figuring we'd just bite the bullet on the expense to ensure the kids had a nice day. For $20 a band you can book to go on rides but all it means is that you don't have to physically stand in the queue you just 'reserve your spot' and you cannot book more than one ride at a time so it's not like you could go off and go on any other rides in the meantime. The premium band was $40 and it operated on the same principle but offered to cut the wait time in half, but at $240 for us all we offered to just buy our kids the bands as it was too expensive and bless them they all refused as they wanted to be together as a family and felt it was a complete waste of money.It was 38 degrees that day and we saw a young girl faint from having to queue in the heat for so long, By the time we finished queuing for the third ride in the full sun for an hour, filling water bottles from a warm drinking water fountain our kids didn't want to go on anymore of the rides. So we headed over to the overly crowded wave pool, let them splash about there and took them home feeling disappointed that we had wasted a day of our holiday and all that money on what was a truly dreadful experience.I have to say this is by far the worst waterpark ever. Next year we will stick with Cyprus and the waterpark at Ayia Napa which is fantastic... the rides may not be any groundbreaking hydromagnetic engineering phenomenon, but quite honestly kids just want the thrill of fast slides and getting soaked, not to be stood bone dry and dehydrated.Don't waste your money here, get to the beach with a boogie board for your thrills.",Meandmyminions
30,Horrible jamba juice workers! Great water slides! What!! Dole machine was busted,"So there are only a few things you come to Raging Waters for. Great water slides!! Awesome Dole ice cream..and good customer service.. well, one of those things were great on this last trip. The water slides!! But not so great, the Dole machine was busted..they said they were working on it. Ya right. So we went to get yogurt at the Jamba juice they have at Raging Waters. Well, line was not so crowded and guess what. Out of yogurt!! lol. So I got a smoothie. 30 mins later. It came out. As I sat there the kids inside were goofing off and using profanity like it was a day off. No supervisor at all. There was a line around the building and nobody cared. They sat in the little room laughing and playing like little poops. I'm never buying anything from Raging Waters again. No changing room?",losttrekker
10,Not like it used to be!,"The Raging Waters of today is not what I remember. They let in way too many people, all the lines are too long, the park is in disrepair and not very clean at all. They ran out of life jackets for little ones. They shut down the wave pool every two cycles for ""safety check"". What that means is that there are too many people and the water is too murky for them to safely keep it running.The lazy river is like a marathon. The life guards have no control, there are no tubes to ride in and the water was DISGUSTING! I was afraid I was going to catch something.Never again. Will not go back and will not recommend to anyone.",percmom
10,Raging Queues,"Similar to other reviewers, nice water park spoilt by outrageously long queues. Starting with 30 min wait to get into parking lot (not including 20 min shuttle ride/wait from parking to entrance), proceeding to at least hour long queues for most of the major rides and culminating in waiting for 1.25 hours only to be told ride is broken. Best avoided overall.",lost_one70
10,"Name Should Be Changed to ""Raging Lines""","If you read the reviews you'll see two themes. Very long lines and staffing that is small in #s and age -- meaning if you run into a problem (and you likely will), you'll have to wait in line to talk to someone (and they'll likely not resolve whatever issue you have).A few examples:Raging Waters doesn't seem to cut off ticket sales. So they'll sell as many tickets as people are willing to buy. This is a problem on a very hot summer day where there are far more people than the park or staffing can handle.Parking (line) -- incredibly there was a total of one (yes one) person accepting payment for parking to enter. There were 3 people there but only one was working the other two seemed to be in charge of chatting with each other. Hard to imagine that on one of the busiest days of the year, Raging Waters management thought to themselves, ""let's make everyone come through a single entrance and let's staff it with a single individual -- that's a great way to save us money and send a message to the people coming in that we don't value customer experience in the least.""Shuttle (line)-- Our first line was for buses in the overflow parking. It's hard to explain here but if you tried to imagine the slowest possible way to have people board buses, this was it. More staff and at least one staffer with a brain (or motivation) to load the buses quicker would have cut the line. And how about a few more buses?Ticket (line) -- If you purchase and print your tickets at home, does this mean you can skip the purchase line? No way to tell. It turns out no. Yes that rigtht, printing / purchasing your own tickets saves you exactly zero time.Security (line) -- I get it, they need security but how about hiring a few more people. Most of what I saw being confiscated was (outside) food -- more on that later.H2Go Pass (line) -- this is the pass that essentially doubles the price of your ticket but means you don't have to wait in lines as long. Once again this is another line (and by the way a line that you have to wait again to turn it back in).Locker (lines) -- this was a real cluster. If you have valuables and don't want them stolen (most items are not allowed on rides) you need a locker. Guess what, they ran out of lockers with absolutely no fall back. I asked someone what I should do with my backpack when I got on the ride and he suggested I feel it at the foot of the ride and come back and get it after (that would be assuming it was still there).Food (lines) -- the food choices are absymal. Carl's Jr would be one of their top choices. But they double the prices and that is only after what must have been a 30 min wait. After that -- good luck finding somewhere to sit and eat. It's one thing to wait in line for a popular slide, but to wait in line to eat because you didn't allow people to bring in their own food is just greed. Is it so hard to bring in food trucks, carts, etc. on busy days?Ride lines -- I was floored how long the lines were. I understand the concept of safety in that they have to wait until the rider(s) ahead are off before letting the next ones go. But how about hiring someone from Disney to adivse you how to speed it up. I saw so much ineffiiciency (and apathy) from staff. It's as though Raging Waters theory is that we've already got you here, what does it matter how long you wait?Closed Rides -- on what must have been one of the most busy days a year, why would you allow slides to be closed? I'm sorry but I don't think the technology on a water ride is so advanced that Raging Waters shouldn't be able to have all rides open.A few additional suggestions for Raging Waters -- 1) hire even a few experienced folks to help out. I saw so many frustrated people not sure where to go with their questions / problems. Even one person meeting the buses saying ""if you have already purchased tickets then you need to..."". 2) More signage for pretty much everything. 3) Figure out your capacity and cut off sales before hitting it. Disney can do this, so can you.Raging Waters charges a premium for pretty much everything (from entrance, to food and lockers) and they should invest at least a little of that money back into making the experiences of their customers a little less painful.",EncinoMan779
10,Will never go again!,"We went to Raging Waters San Dimas yesterday, July 25th with my cousin and our three children. We bought our tickets off Groupon which was easy to do. When we got there at 1:00 we were redirected to overflow parking and took the tram to the water park. Entry was the easiest task accomplished all day! When we entered the park there was no cabanas available and no lounge chairs available. We decided to put most of our items in lockers and let the kids hit the slides. My cousin and I set up by the lazy river and finally found one chair to set up on. Upon entering the lazy river I found the water to be super cloudy and foul smelling. Also there was many used bandaids floating in the water!! The lifeguards were not scanning their water which also concerned me. Many patrons were allowed to be ultra rowdy and not corrected. I decided to go and ride a few slides solo which was also another problem as many rides are only available to double riders. Getting on the slides was confusing too as I didn’t know what tube to use or even where the tubes are available. Lots of slides were also closed. The wait is very long on the slides. I feel that due to upkeep and overcrowding this park is failing in providing a successful family experience. For these reasons I don’t recommend this water park.",Stefanie P
20,Needs an upgrade,If this is LA's best water park then it is a poor effort. Someone needs to visit Florida to see how water parks should be. Changing area is any space you can find in the rest room. Some rides are closed in summer! What is that all about? Overcrowded for the number of rides and space. A couple of good rides but overall not a great experience.,Michael A
10,Overrated Park,"Not what we expected. Looks dirty, not enough staff, line of 10 people behind me took 35 min to take 3 tenders with French fries. Line for pizza other 40 minutes, not too many people on line. Bathrooms dirty. Some slide are closed. Line for waterslide took more than 50 minutes.",Omar R
10,Horrible experience,We were so excited to try this park. First the parking is miles away. Took forever to get in and park. Then had to take a tram in which took forever. The lines were unbearable. We spent hours in lines. We were able to ride 3 rides in 7 hours. Took hours in Lin line to get food. Everything was over priced and took forever. The park is so poorly run I can even state it enough. I will never go again and would not recommend going. Save your money,Ac10up
10,OMG! Don’t waste your money or time.,"I don’t know what all the hype on the radio and ads are about. Must just be to get your there so they can get your money. Place was dirty, old and not maintained trash everywhere. It seems just like a place locals send their kids and teens to get rid of them for the day. No structure. Wave pool closes one hour before park closes so beware. I’ve been to much better water parks and not a bug as they advertise. I live in Cali and would feel sorry for a family who came from out of state or far away to visit this park. Please!!!! buyer beware!!!!!!",beckeygill
10,"Unprofessional, poor service and upkeep",Poor service around the park with too few hired staff to deal with crowds. No wifi in the park or anywhere close. Arrived via Uber but had no way to book on the way back and it took 5 attempts for someone to offer to put us in touch with a cab company. Very young staff without guidance it seems and no overwhelming enthusiasm to want to assist anyone.A fight broke out at the table next to us with no security to intervene and since the staff were so young they let it pass and walked away.Several rides not working and the rest of the lines were way too long. I appreciate this is the peak period but overall service and processes could be better managed.Traveled from South Africa and this left a poor perception of service and offering in the area. Waste of money unless a local and off season. Other foreign visitors may as well stay away.,Stephen B
30,A bit disappointed,"I'm from the UK and we came here as part of our honeymoon. Whilst we are both a little overweight (not huge by any means), it meant we couldn't ride together in the double rings/tubes so we were told we had to get a solo ring/tubes - fair enough. We then couldn't find any and then we found out that we had to pay to hire a solo ring, despite already paying a high admission fee which p****d us off as European water-parks have a good supply of solo/double tubes/rings for everyone to use. It seemed that the rides here had huge waiting times (despite queues not being that long) due to lack of staff (I often saw 1 for each ride back in June). It would be better to have a member of staff dealing with a group of people whilst another member of staff could be getting the next group ready to keep the waiting times down.Some areas are very steep so no suitable for everyone. The changing areas weren't great - no privacy and seemed to be lacking. Concrete gets very hot.",blackrainbow86
10,Nightmare Waterpark,"This was our first time visiting this location. We figured we only live an hour away so why not try it on a hot summer day. From the start it was a mess. The lines weren’t organized, the tables in all sections of the park had piles of trash from the food spots, and some of the rides were broken or not working half the day. Honestly, they need to shut this place down and reopen it when they resurface the wave pool, walkways and fix the water rides.Oh and if a person tells a food worker that they are allergic to something, and the worker says “oh there aren’t any ‘XYZ’ in the burger” then make sure you are correct. My wife got sick.I told the customer service guy and he told his manager but they didn’t want to resolve my issue which was “give me a refund”. We were only there for an hour and a half. They were 20 years old, if that. I waited for the higher boss to come and he told me the same thing, “no refunds.” I threatened to go to the news stations so he magically handed me my money back. Didn’t need to go this far. Fix your place and get new workers and management.",mangelomusic
20,Prepare to wait (a lot),"The park looks good and the slides are fun but prepare to wait in line for hours! We were in the park for 6 hours and only had time to do 4 slides as we stood in line for the rest of the day:- in line for the train to pick us up from the parking lot (and back, ugh)- in line for over 20 minutes for a coffee- at least 1 hour in line for every slideAnd although it was a very busy day, the real wait is caused by the (lack of) speed of letting people go in the slides. I guess it’s regulatory but European water parks move people around way faster, thus having shorter waiting lines.",Jonatan
40,"Awesome day, not too many crowds","The staff was consistently friendly, lines were not too long in early June, rode most slides in one day, kept Pretty clean, bathrooms really need updating, to be kept more clean. Brought our own towels, sunscreen, wore sandals and then held them in hands for slides. Really fun day overall. Parking is 15 per car, we paid 15 for large locker, 8.99 for a chicken sandwich in the park. 3.99 for bottled water. But there are fountains you can refill an empty bottle if you bring one in. No outside food allowed, but seemed easy to try to get it in as we saw others with outside food. There was a cooler storage area for bringing your own lunch and leaving it right outside. We had the best day there, got on a lot of slides twice. Went as three adults- had a blast.",kasey903
50,Raging Waters Rocks!,This place is awesome always a fun time with kids of all ages. Lockers available to keep your purse & belongings they make you pay but you get the deposit back when you return the key. Definitely recommended for a fun time.,adriag12356
50,Good times,When the season starts its really packed. The trick is that you need to go during the week or get there early. Just rember to take some money for rentals,jbamf21
40,Raging Waters,Usual waterpark but a nice area and easy to get to. Tucked away in a hilly mountain area adds to the ambience.,M5162COericr
10,Absolute waste of time and money,"Usually I follow the philosophy of ""if you can't say anything nice, then don't say anything at all"". However, after my trip to Raging Waters today I felt compelled to abandon this philosophy and to speak up about this total waste of time and money. I have been to many other water parks before and usually enjoy them a lot, but not Raging Waters. Lines were long and slow, the park is old and not well maintained, and the facilities were not clean. Aside from all of this the slides were unimaginative, short, and not at all worth the wait to ride them. After more than 3 hours in the park and the 3rd disappointing slide we decided to leave and not waste any more of our time.",lillmirra
30,Nothing Special Here,"This waterpark was sort of a disappointment. On our visit several of the attractions were closed including the lazy river which is always on or our favorite places to sit back and relax. The park was dirty, lots of trash laying around. Landscaping need attention also. The wait times were ridiculous considering the park was barely full. Many of the slides were only using two or three tubes/rafts so the wait time were long even though the lines were not. I've been several other water parks and this one doesn't compare. I would not go back again.",Jayson B
30,Good to go with the family,"Love the lazy rivers during hot summer days. Since this is the only park (besides Knott's Soak City) in our area, we made the trip to see how was it. The weather was absolutely perfect for the pools, hot and humid. I did take the precaution to book a cabana; there were 6 of us so chances to get a chair were slim. Because of this we didn't rent a locker. On first impression the park looks a bit run down. Not a lot of places to sit down and yes, bees everywhere. This park specializes in water roller coasters! Some of them were quite scary so we started with the mild rides. Upon arrival the lazy river was closed but they opened it in the afternoon. The wave pool stops and kicks everyone out every so often, which is a bit annoying. The food is nothing to write home about, greasy burgers and greasier pizza but you're not there for a gourmet experience. We had a lovely day and would consider coming back next year.",Nalalita
40,Excellent Park for all,"Wether you want to stroll, hike or bike a trail. View the lake from the many directions. This park is for everyone, families or events.",Sergio R
20,Things to know before you go,"--$15 cash only to park, $12 for a locker that fit an average size bag/backpack, $ extra to rent a single tube if you're a single rider for a few of the rides. These were a few of the extra fees.--This isn't a great park if you're riding rides alone. Most rides require couples or even-numbered groups and don't allow for single riders.--Bring shoes! The cement is very hot and you'll have to either stow or carry your shoes on rides.--Come ready to hike. Some of the bigger rides require walking down substantial hills to get mats then carry them back up to get on the ride. Then of course walking back up the hill after the ride.--Bring an extra credit card if you're not using cash. My card was rejected when purchasing a fast pass and a few staff members said this was common if you use the card more than once in the park.We brought a refillable water cup from Six Flags and I was grateful that I was able to get free ice water refills all day without having to purchase a Raging Waters cup. The rides they have are fun and the fast pass worked well.I agree with the review, ""don't compare to Orlando."" We had a great time there at Aquatica and were hoping for a similar experience.",EssBree
30,Bees everywhere!!!!! Ugh. Half the little kids stuff was shut down.,"This place has some super fun rides, which makes up for the bad stuff, but it really needs some work.If you are allergic to bees, DO NOT go here. There are bees everywhere, and anywhere there is food around they are even more abundant.On top of it, we came with one kid that just turned 8 and this was her birthday gift from us in lieu of a party. And half the stuff for her age range was closed.We still had a good time, but we probably won't be back, even with this waterpark being one of very few in the area. It's just not that nice and the bees are too much.",Simple M
30,Disappointed,"Took my 8 year old daughter for the first time here and we were very disappointed. We arrived at 11 am an hour after opening and ALL OF THE CHAIRS were taken. People were reserving rows of chairs with towels. Throughout the day we were tired and there was absolutely no where for us to sit down and rest. We walked the entire park and could not find a single chair. Not sure why, could have been the heat but my daughter started to feel very dizzy and felt like she was going to faint and i could not find a single chair for her to sit on. I ended up having to take her into the first aid office so that she can lay for a bit. The staff there was very helpful. Also, the amount of bees is ridiculous! There are bees EVERYWHERE and not just one or two about 10 together in a group. The worse of it is when you are trying to eat. Like I said a group of 10 would come and sit on our food. People were eating standing trying to avoid the bees. Overall, we do not have plans on returning to this water park.",Brenda H
20,"Going downhill, but have to wait in line to get there....","My family went there last weekend and knowing it was a weekend it would be packed. We pre-paid for the meals and understood the price would cover any combo meal in the park. It did so at Carl's Jr. but Pinks made us pay extra for one meal but didn't refund any money for us for a meal that was LESS than the price we paid up front. The rides were much worse. Vortex was shut down altogether and the High Extreme only had one tube running. 2 hours in line for 20 seconds of fun, hmmm. We tried Thunder Rapids towards the end of the evening and although the line was short, we never seemed to move. The crew ran only 4 rafts even though they could have handled 6 or 8 easily. Long wait between people getting into rafts. The end result of that was the people with the H2GO passes were able to keep coming back through the line and getting on again; a fact that seemed to amuse the snarky little high school kids working the line (David A.). Hey management, there are other water parks around and you need to pay attention to the bad reviews!",davegrk
10,Dirty and expensive!!,"I took my daughter to Raging Waters for the first time. She and i have been to many similar places over the years and we have always had a lot of fun together.Raging Waters is the absolute worst we have visited!!Apart from being the most expensive just to enter on a basic pass (forget the add ons like the H2O fast pass, or the cabins), the park is DIRTY.The steps down to the wave pool looked as though they hadn't been cleaned in years, and there was a collection of sand, dirt and algae (dont want to imagine what else) was collecting on the steps.The food seating area was disgusting!! The area was large enough to seat many people, but it was impossible to find a clean table that was free from leftover lunches and wasps in abundance!The changing area was a joke! The toilet areas i just don't want to remember!We felt disgusted there, and we wont be going back.The rides were ok, but the lines were so long, you got bored waiting to get on them.VERY BAD EXPERIENCE",Darren H
10,Worst water park ever,"I can honestly say this is the worst water park ever. Under staffed with long lines. 5+ hours for two rides! All they care about is front of line passengers. Plus, don't buy prepay for meals online, it's a scam.",ncacchad
10,"Dirty, expensive, frustrating","Showers are moldy, restrooms are dirty as well as most of the park. We did not pay so much because we were part of a large group. Bought the souvenir cups on line the night before (almost $11), turns out we had to pay for refills all day. The park was supposed to be open from 10am to 7pm but employees shut down a couple of rides and would not say why.",Sara L
40,"Good Time, but Raging Water needs some work","I am a grandmother that went with a group of 12. We all had a great time, but I noticed that the place needs some work. I did not have water shoes on (would highly recommend them) and found in certain spots that the concrete is cracked and slippery. This seems dangerous and I found myself having to be very careful when walking down the hills in Raging Waters. We rented a cabana, which was nice for our large group, but if I ever went again with a smaller group, you don't need a cabana. The food was good, and they had many lifeguards and security to keep the roughnecks under control. We especially liked the river ride with the inner tubes. All in all a really fun day.",simbaroo59

30,Don't compare it to Orlando !!,"Having visited the USA many times I am going to write this review but will try not to compare it to the bigger Water Parks in Orlando. As I am told, this is the biggest water park in California. We got there at 0945 and the queues were already big but not supervised or organised so it was a free for all. Getting through wasn't too bad and we managed to secure enough Loungers and seats for a base camp, there were 8 in our party. If we had left it any later we would have had to put our bags on tables set aside for food. We made good use of the family of four on line ticket price that included a large pizza and four drinks, which was still cheaper than the family ticket. The pizza didn't disappoint. There definitely was a wasp problem but apart from clearing food away fast, I don't see how the park staff would be able to deal with this. Maybe if they supervised the eating areas stopping people leaving half eaten food on the tables for them to return to, this would stop the wasps hovering.The park itself is tired and could do with some TLC. The rides were all on top of each other but that wasn't so bad because our 4 teenagers managed to ride all the rides in one day.The staff were ok but lacked enthusiasm or real professionalism and there seemed to be a shortage of them. For those that have experienced the likes of Aquatica (Orlando) or the Disney water parks you will be disappointed. However it is still worth a day out, but get there early.",Becky B
20,Fun but Not,Fun place! However by 1 pm time for lunch right? Plan on standing in long hot lines and then get up to ordering time and they have run out of the item you wanted! Or at least said they did. Only 3 hours into to park opening! So quick regroup.... 2 child size cheese pizza slices! 1 small drink 1 regular drink just shy of $20 So overpriced! Organic menu options posted as a healthy option also a no show! Plan on standing in hot sun in long lines also for each ride other than the lazy river! Not a fun experience! Oh yes parking is $15If you go take your patience with you! Additional Food trucks to help the flow of moving along would be my advise! Btw...No where to sit if you want to enjoy watching your kids.,Planwithme

10,disappointed,"Use to love Raging Waters. I have gone many times of the years. This year's experience is the worse.Have been three times this season... was disappointed every time. Would not have gone back but we had bought season tickets on line.1. When we arrived at the park, we had to take a picture for our season pass outside at the pay booth. (In the past, you took the picture inside the park anytime of the day) Got there 15 minutes after they opened and had to wait over an hour just to get our pictures with season pass cards... the temp was in the high 80's, no shade.2.They have reduced the number of tubes for the wave pool and the lazy river, but they are more than happy to rent you one for $7 ( its about making money)3. The two times I got there when I park opened, The bathrooms were not clean and smelled. Some are missing doors, and some are missing locks for the doors.4. Trash, Trash, Trash. They don't do a good job cleaning the night before since there is trash on the ground first thing in the morning, INCLUDING a slice of pizza sitting on the ledge, next to the lazy river and it sat there all day, It was there before the park opened and never removed. THAT IS GROSS!5. There is a small planter as you enter the Lazy River, which had water that had puddled over time and that has not drained. It is covered with moss. The Smell was horrible!6. BEES, BEES, BEES everywhere.7. They are under staffed. The lazy river opens 1 hour after the park does ( half of the park is this way). BUT the Lazy River didn't open on time because they did not have enough staff.8. Our passes came with drinking cups. Got into the food lines which are long, only to find out that at that booth they were out. It could have been nice if they sent a runner, instead they made us do to a different line to wait again. We had to do this THREE times.. Did I mention the lines are long.9.... MAYBE THEY NEED A NEW MANAGEMENT group....",kimhively
20,Gross and disappointing,"Haven't been in 16 years thought we would take the family. Arrived prior to the park opening and was let in about 5 mins early and the park was a mess with trash everywhere. Water bottles and drink cups and wrappers in the fountains and all around. It didn't seem like they cleaned the park from the day prior. Half the park was closed until 1 hour after opening so only a few ride were open when we arrived. That meant the rides that were open were packed. They have a new buy a fast pass ticket and that makes ride wait times INSANE!!! So not only do you have to wait in one line, but they have made two lines which are just as long as the normal lines which pretty much doubles your wait times. Good for the park to make money but bad for the customer waiting and for the people who paid extra money for this ticket and still have to wait just as long as the people who didn't buy this ticket. Basically they doubled the wait times with this feature. They have rules listed on their website where they make it clear that this is a family park and these rules will be adhered to. Well, women were walking around in g-strings (no inappropriate swimwear, revealing swimwear listed as inappropriate). At least 4 men wearing inappropriate clothing with the ""F"" word on it, also a rule. No children left to roam the park without parent supervision and that was rampant too. None of the height requirements were being followed. Ride attendants let pretty much anyone on who wanted to ride. I watched a 5 year old with his bigger sister who wasn't older then 8 get on a ride. As we waited in line for slides the landscaping hadn't been attended to. Weeds were everywhere. Eating lunch, it took us 30 min to get our food and there were only 5 people in line ahead of us. The eating areas were infested with bee's. You couldn't eat because the bee's were everywhere and wouldn't leave us alone. We went to look for other tables and people were using the tables all through out the park as their personal cabana's. They placed their bags and towels on them and used them through out the day not for eating but for family, so trying to find a spot to eat was difficult. The overall park was messy, gross and unkept. It appeared that they(Raging Waters) didn't care. I spoke with management and while I got the placated ""sorry"" speech I left feeling as if nothing would be done about it.",81artmonk
10,Gross experience,"Visited this park in July, first off the staff at the ticket booths were very unpleasant and so were most inside. Once inside we tried to get a cabana all these were already occupied ok no problem, we then tried to find somewhere to sit this proved to be impossible. People were even occupying the lunch tables there was absolutely nowhere to sit,after walking around for about 15 mins trying to find a spot we decided to share a bench with another family who was already there. The bench was dirty and gross ketchup stains and old food marks were stuck to the table and under the table had a bunch of old food. I was so disgusted I decided I would not be venturing into the water. The children,however,went with other family members who reported back that most of the rides were closed .The lines to get onto the rides that were working were too long and full of garbage on the sides. The garbage bins were also NASTY not opened for the public we had to open them to dispose of items very nasty the bathroom was awful I took one look and turned around. I would not recommend this place to my enemy we left after about an hour not worth the price they charge to get in. My suggestion is close it down and do some renovations for next summer .I will NEVER visit this nastiness again.",missb876

Our first impression was that the p,"We arrived as the park opened and did not have a very long wait to purchase tickets. Our first impression was that the park is not clean. Our day began in the shallow children's play area. There were chip bags and plastic bottles scattered in and around this area . . . and this was shortly after the park opened. Several rides did not open until 11:00 so we went to the wave pool. We played there for nearly an hour and the wave feature never was turned on. Some type of footwear is a necessity as the walkways are so hot they burn your feet. Misters or some way to wet the unshaded areas would be a huge improvement. The lazy river was a nice design, but little is done to remove debris from the water. Trash was accumulating along the edges. We waited in line for an hour for the large raft ride. The main pavilion includes a Carl's Jr. the area was not kept clean by park staff. We would not recommend Raging Waters.",Stargate1026
30,Fun time but room for improvement,Visited during our recent trip to LA. Was a manageable day from a crowd perspective. Slides were a blast and all in family enjoyed once you got on. Lines moved really slow though on all attractions and seemed like could have been improved. Bathrooms were dirty. A little on expensive side with 15$ for parking and then tickets above and beyond that. If going more than once an annual pass would be more cost effective likely.,beaver3479
10,The worst park experience ever,"We arrived at the park at 2pm. It took at least an hour to get a snack. Floating rings were not available, not even to rent, as there were too many ppl ( rings are $7 each). We were only able to ride 1 short ride, this should say a lot. The place resembled a zoo in its crisis. There were way more ppl than the park can handle. If you want to go to the water park just to spend all day in line for the burger and riding a very dirty lazy river, go ahead. I noticed that ppl with special needs are basically ignored. The management is sending you from one place to another without any results, acting as if they're seeing a problem for the first time. It was a nightmare experience... I'm not that picky but it's just a bad place. Maybe it's better on a weekdays...",JunglePanther
20,Lines way too slow,Went here on a visit to LA as it got better reviews than other waterparks in the area. I bought the family ticket which included lunch and went on a Thursday. On arrival we were told that you had to buy towels if you did not bring your own. A locker rental for our stuff was $12 which I think is a bit excessive. The start of the day was not too bad with reasonable queues. But as the day went on the queues got longer and by the afternoon we were waiting for over an hour for a ride that lasted 42 seconds. The staff seemed uninterested and the ride management was not good. I understand these sort of wait times in a rollercoaster park but not in a waterpark. Lunch was good except for the fact that they would not accept the voucher I was sent on my phone so I had to go to an office to get it printed. The management should go to Florida to see how a proper waterpark is run.,joe292
40,Wave pool and lazy river,"When I was a teenager, I used to love all the water slides at the Raging River. This Summer, I bought the season pass for my son, his friend, and myself. The season started May 20th, but it was still too cold, so our first visit was June 11th, 2017. It was still cloudy & chilly on this day. The kids were still in school. The water park was not crowded. We had a chance to try all the water slides. Since then, we returned to this water park four times. The second time was June 24th, the first weekend the kids got out of school. It was about 85 degrees Fahrenheit, warm, and the water was perfect. The kids were having fun and the lines for each ride was longer. I spent most of the time in the lazy river or the wave pool. There are still 7 weeks until the end of Summer, and we plan to visit this water park 3 more times. The water park is a great place for a teenager and his teenage friends to hang out. It's an alternative place for the adults to relax instead of the crowded beach. Okay, I'll go straight to the costs and what you expect to spend at the park.1. Standard Seasonal Pass $692. Premium Seasonal Pass $89 (more discount for all purchases & foods)3. Fast foods combo price ranging $10 -$13 per combo (burger, hot dog, or fried chicken)4. Parking $15*The water park is much more fun for a teenagers & more relaxing for the adults. See these pictures and you decide.....",GG92844
40,California Largest Waterpark,"I tend to not review popular destinations because I feel like I wouldn't have anything new to say about them - But I think I can give a few tips about this Waterpark -It is BIG. So big one might think they are seeing the entire park before them when they enter but to the right, just out of view is an entire other section.Any free parking would be way to far away to walk in, so that's not a practical option.Get there early if you want a lounge chair. Shade is scarce too, unless you want to pay for a cabana. Bring water shoes or sandals as the cement gets really hot walking between attractions.We saw the ""High Extreme"" towering in front of us so decided to go there first. After walking up 8 flights of stairs, or so, we thought this was going to be a fun, scary slide. It was marked a 3 (out of 4) and it was NOT as exciting as the view from the top suggested. Worth doing, but other slides were more fun.The ""Aqua Rocket"" is described as a ""Water Roller-coaster"" and may be the best ride in the parkMaybe my best tip? - It seems one can rent a single Tube for $8 and with that, you can cut ahead in a couple rides where the Double Tubes take a LONG time to cycle around for use.Water Bottles are allowed - We brought in a Large Refillable one, no problem (We NEVER use disposable plastic, polluting, toxic leaking, water bottles anyway, so we were happy) No outside food is allowed, but I suspect you could have a couple Cereal Bars or box of raisin in your pocket without a problem.Food, Lockers and extras get expensive quick, so just plan ahead. - They seem to open before the schedule times so if you plan on being early, plan on getting there even a little sooner than opening time.",Bentheredunthat
30,So crowded,"Over the last 5 years, we have watched RR become overly crowded and the wait time for each slide has gone from 15-20 minutes to 40-50 minutes per slide. Additionally, the climate has become rough, lots of profanity waiting in line and trash litters the pool deck. It was a great place for 4-8th grade kids to have fun and be semi-independent, but now we just go to the beach.",Melissa G
50,Great place for the kids,"We've lived in the Via Verde neighborhood for years and had never been until last year. The kids loved it. Great place for a hot day. You can rent a gazebo for private family place to rest and store things. The cost is very reasonable, especially if you get a season pass. It pays for itself in no time. It is close to Bonelli Park which is another great place to visit afterwards for a BBQ. Parking can be a little tricky, but if you're patient, it will work out great.",Dana E
10,This place is now disgusting,"Every time our grandkids went, a few of the rides were down. Come to find out, when someone called in sick, they just ignored it and shut the rides down. Not as clean as it used to be. Refuse to go back",Cheryl M
40,Title?,"Getting older but well maintained - a great place for youngsters to be carefree! Summer gets hectic, so come early and stay late!","William ""Baja B... F"
50,Very friendly crowd,Bring your swim suit and get ready to enjoy one of the most insane experiences you can have when it comes to water slides and family fun. I suggest don't eat to much before showing up. If you do wait 30 min before having fun...,Peter M
40,Excellent Late Summer Day,"We arrives on Saturday at the end of the season expecting the park to be packed, but to be very pleasantly surprised that it was quiet. There were enough slides of varying ""thrill level"" to keep the whole group happy, and the racing slides were particularly popular. Being quieter than expected there were very short (if any) waiting times. There was an adequate number of food outlets to keep us all happy. The only down side I would say was the lack of changing facilities and showers for after the days activity. We were forced to change in the rest rooms and had to place our bags on the wet floor. Having said that it was an excellent day and good value for money as we booked out tickets on line in advance. I will certainly visit the park again if we are in the area in future.",Mark L
50,birthday party,"had sooooo much fun there for my daughters bday party every yr... we had lunch in the picnic area, also rented a cabana for our stuff n drinks... Very fun place to take the daring kids in your life... LOL!!",DebbieDeb187
30,Kids will have fun,Visited ranging waters for Labor Day and kids had an awesome time. Weather was in the the high 70s but it didn't stop us from enjoying our day. Wish they had heated pools cause water was cold but once in the water everything was ok. If u plan to visit u have to try their funnel cakes with ice cream..! It's super delicious. Food is overpriced but u have the option of bringing your cooler and eating outside in a picnic area they have beside admissions,Evelyn A
40,Great time at Raging Waters,"Took daughters of 13 and 11 years old for a day at Raging Waters and everyone had a great time. It didn't seem overly crowded for a Saturday which was great, but at times the lines for the rides took a really long time. They do have the option of buying a fast pass too access the rides quicker.",dlbibb
40,Aqua rocket is No 1,"It took a while to drive to this place and was disappointed as it seems quite small on first impression but gets better as you explore all the rides. It's probably not as good as some of the Orlando or Mediterranean water parks but still great fun, The aqua rocket being our favourite as the best slide/ride.",ThePowerNapper
10,Attraction waiting for a lawsuit,I reported my granddaughter getting injured on their poorly maintained chairs and I've still not heard from Raging Waters. They're all about the money and you're at your own risk once you get there. Employees arguing over their schedule and overtime instead of the medical personnel taking care of my granddaughter that was bleeding and bruised from the chair that trapped her leg. This place is just waiting for a lawsuit to happen and the workers there could care less. These people have yet to contact us to see if Madison is okay after little over 3 months.,Cee-Jay B
50,Awesome summer fun,"Summer vacation is close to the end for my son, we decided to spend a day in the water park. We arrived at the time of opening. Early birds get the seat. Wonderfully water rides and slides. My son was so excited to be here, even woke up twice in the night. Meet and exceed our expectations, will come again next time.",cchangle
40,Raging Waters is Great if You Go on a Monday or Tuesday With H2Go Pass + Tips On Making Your Day Great,"After reading many reviews both good and bad, I decided to go with my 12 year old son and here is how we had a successful day.Begin by purchasing your tickets online the day before you go to get the $12 Monday or Tuesday discount online.2nd: Get there BEFORE 10am, the gates actually were open before 10am and we were able to find a comfortable place to put our towel and personal items down on a chair for the day. Parking was available and easy at 9:45am ($15)3rd: Get your locker to lock up your valuables (wallet & car keys - $12 for the small locker), leave everything else in the trunk of your car. You can always get your hand stamped to re-enter if you need to get to your car.4th: Buy your H2Go pass ($25 or $40 if you want to splurge). During your wait time we swam in the Wave Cove pool or in the Amazon Adventure Pool . Wait times were short overall.5th: Have your lunch at 11:30am before it gets busy. We kept it simple and had the Pinks hot dog combo $10.With the H2Go pass we were able to do all the rides that we wanted to do throughout the day without much of a wait. We had a blast. I originally thought we would spend 3 to 4 hours at the park but stayed for 7 hours!It is an expensive day overall, about $190 for the two of us, but if you want to have fun without waiting in the lines.. that is the price of admission.I look forward to going back next season. Enjoy!",AlanFinLA
40,Haters Please Relax,"People, please, this is a water park. Just like any other amusement park there are several givens here:1) You will pay to park. It's $15. Does that seem like a lot? It's cheaper than Disney or Universal. But the good side is that, if you get there early (maybe before 11am, depending on the day), you'll be parking a one minute walk from the gate. Bring a cooler and have a picnic! That said, the upper lot is definitely annoying. The shuttle can take a while and, alternatively, the walk is long. Get to the park early for short lines and a cooler in the car!Which leads to...2) Food is expensive. Hey, this is a major money-maker for the park. Again, just like any other amusement park. Come on, what do you expect? The fact is that the pizza is pretty good and a good deal for a family. And there's a Pink's now. And Yogurtland. Yes, they are more expensive than outside. Get over it or bring a picnic.3) It's not Disneyland. (Okay is is a given that doesn't apply to Disneyland.) This means the bathrooms are a little dirty. The landscaping has some garbage lying around. The employees are bored. They're just teenagers on summer break, for goodness's sake. Don't expect a lot.Further thoughts: again, get there early. Waits are way shorter and the pavement is not so searing. Bring flip flops and a credit card and skip the expensive lockers! You don't need anything else inside the park. And, sure, if you have money to burn, buy the H2O passes. I don't think that's fair to folks of lesser means but it's your right. If you don't do it, then stop complaining about the lines. Anyway, I've never stood for even an hour. That's half a Splash Mountain or Star Tours line time. And consider buying a season pass. They're about $55-60 for the cheap ones. That's less than the cost of two discounted admissions or one admission plus an H2O pass and there are no blackout days.It's a goof, it gets you in the sun and the water, and, come on, even most of the negative reviewers admit at least their kids have fun. Relax and enjoy your life.",buddhaauthor
10,Really disappointing,"We visited this park on Wednesday 3rd August. It was horrible the toilets stank and were really dirty, the smell of them lingered around the park. We got there about half an hour after it opened and there were no sun beds left so we had a look at the prices of the cabanas by the time we had decided which one to go for they had sold out. We found a patch of hard sand near the smelly pool for younger children. My husband and step daughter went on a slide and came back an hour later and by this time we were hungry for lunch. My daughter wouldn't eat due to the smell in the park but my husband, step daughter and myself decided to get a burger from the fast food place upstairs. It took an hour to get our fast food! It was ok when we got it though. Then the other 3 decided to go on a slide and I decided to wait at the bottom and watch them as it was so uncomfortable to sun bathe. It took an hour and fourth five minutes for them to get to the front of the queue and within this time I went to the wave pool, which was dissapointing as there was hardly any waves. After this we decided to leave as it was getting close five pm and the park shuts at six, we wanted to avoid the queues for the shuttle bus to the car park. We got on the shuttle quickly and will never go back.",Love Travel
30,"Great place, but too many rip offs.","It starts with the parking... $15 is average these days, but we had to walk 15 minutes in 100 degree heat over a hill to get to the gate because they don't offer enough shuttles and the line was overwhelming. Disneyland's parking is the same price, but you get a covered parking garage and constant shuttles in return.It continues with the lines in the park, some lines they make no provision for groups with an odd number, no single rider option. I go with my two teen kids and one of us needs to wait since they don't allow single riders on some attractions, and they don't allow you to ride with someone else.It continues with the pass you can buy to cut in line. Rich people get to cut in line, that what our country has come down to?! Disney has a fast pass, but everyone gets one with their ticket, no extra charge.The icing on top is the expensive crappy food. They had made improvements and seem to be making some changes on this item. Just be prepared with your own food.The staff isn't very attentive. My family was going down a huge tube and bumped in to a family in terror who had gotten stuck in the tunnel and no one noticed. It was pitch black and had we not bumped them, they would have stayed there.Some places around the lazy river have standing water so old it is growing moss in it.",RicOlsen
40,Better get the fast pass,"Ok we went to Raging Waters San Dimas on a Monday 7/18/16. Here are the positives: the fast pass system (or in our case the most expensive one, $40 per person extra) worked amazing. We never had to wait in line for more than a minute or two. Jumbo lockers were great and easy to use, but expensive at $20. The staff was nice and very helpful. The Aqua ride was extremely fun and using the fast pass, did it over and over again. All of the other slides were fun. The kids area was awesome and our kids enjoyed that. Park was clean and well maintained.Here are the negatives that keep it from getting a 5 star rating: you better get the fast pass for $40 each, which is more than double the cost to get into the park. The lines were LONG and if we didn't have the fast pass we would have spent the whole day standing in line. The have a Carls Jr there and it is the most expensive Carls Jr you will ever eat at, for our family of 4 our lunch cost $47.",jeremy r
20,This place needs help!,"Let me start by saying that we went on a Sunday. Perhaps a weeks day will yield a better experience.Pros: Our group of six kids had fun. We were able to cool off in the midst of this crazy heat wave in California. There are three nice kid friendly sections that our young ones loved.Cons: Oh, where do I begin? To start, we pulled up to one of the entrances to park. It took us half an hour to pull up to the guy who was directing the cars into the parking lot, or so me thought. We realized everyone was being told to turn back. The guy tells us the lot is full you can't park here. You couldn't have put up a sign at the start of he road warning people? We finally turned around and another half an hour later we parked on a dirt hill. We come out of the car to see the shuttle line is packed. The people in the line tell us they have been waiting 45 minutes. At this point, we start walking to the park. The walk is 15 minutes down a hill. We finally arrive, get checked in, and start our day. It's now 12!! The place is a mad house. The pools are dirty and murky. The Lazy River has ten tubes to service all these people. Are you kidding me? Why would you not buy more tubes? One of the men in our party went into the men's room and came back and said I will wait. Why? Only one bathroom stall working!!!!! Cold water? We ran out! Did I mention there are only two shuttles servicing the whole park? We walked back up to the car instead of waiting in line for an hour and a half. That was the wait time. Save your $200 dollars and go somewhere else. The Santa Clarita Aquatics Center is only $5.",Hxa0063
40,Great Way to Beat the Heat,"Parking is a little expensive, getting a season pass is worth it if you plan on going more then once. The rides are great but the lines can get very long on the weekend. It is much better if you can go during the week. I always grab a seat away from it all, I avoid the lazy river and the wave pool for seats. They allow you to go in and out of the park so if you park close you can go out to eat and drink instead of paying amusement park prices for food.",Art M
40,Pretty good during the week,Little traffic or many people at the park when we went. The park is a bit better when you have older kids but the little one still enjoy it . Use coupons from smart and final for discount or go to the airport and get a discount flyer,316gimmickst
40,Pay the extra for the H2Go passes!,"Raging Waters San Dimas is a very good waterpark with lots of exciting rides that our whole family could do together. Our youngest is 43"" so this can make it challenging at amusement/waterslide parks but Raging Waters had lots of main rides that she could go on, which was great.They have an extra feature called H2Go that allows you to reserve a spot on the most popular rides (works for eight different slides) and essentially skip the line up. Very cool system. You wear a watch they give you that you scan to make your reservation and then it counts down and let's you know when you can go to that ride and skip the whole line. Don't get the Premier version, the regular is just fine. We did every ride multiple times and saved hours waiting in line. Totally worth it!Downside to this place was the wave pool. Not a great wave pool to begin with and they close or for 20 minutes every hour!! So bizarre watching a couple hundred people asked to exit the pool and it sit empty. The lifeguard said it was for ""water clarity"" which made me not want to go back in anyways. I've been to many water parks and never seen his before so not sure if they have an issue with their filtration system.Only other minor issue was the lack of friendly staff. Having been at Sea World the day before where it's obvious the staff are told to make sure the customers have an amazing day, this place was in stark contrast.But overall, Raging Waters was a blast!",Craigger79
10,Extremely dissapointing. Waste of time.,"This water park is absolutely disgusting. Firstly, there are no visible change rooms unless you wanna change in the toilets.Let's start with my biggest concern: security. I brought a family of 7 people with 7 bags and none of our bags were even checked! This was on FOURTH OF JULY. The day they should have the tightest security, they do this. Can't even imagine what they would be like on a regular day.Secondly, people are allowed to go into the water with their dirty flip flops or shoes. The showers are hidden away so most people don't even take a shower before going into the water.The only redeeming quality would be the slides but a lot of the ""two slide"" slides only have ""one slide"" open so the wait time is basically doubled. Ended up waiting 2 hours for a 10 second long slide. The food is also overpriced.Even more overpriced than Disney food but the quality is the same as fast food.People leave their baggages on all the tanning chairs or the tables to ""reserve"" their spot so you will not find a seat to sit because the staff won't do anything about this. Line hoppers are also a common unpunished occurence here so that's also something to look forward to.They don't have parking zones but they have multiple parking lots so the tram will take you to a parking lot and you could get off at the wrong lot.It was a very dissapointing experience for me and my family and I hope Disney decides to make a waterpark in California.",Shishir S
30,Nice trip on a weekday,"We enjoyed the kids' slides and the lazy river. It would have been more fun if more slides are open. The High Extreme was closed. I think they are conserving water, which is good.Overall, it was enjoyable. :)",lancelonie
10,"Lots of rides CLOSED, Outdated, Overpriced, RUDE Staff & Management, Don't waste your time","Don't waste any precious time or money at this place. A majority of the rides were closed, including the top 3 rides. Their website does not reflect this. Staff and Management are awful and rude. Lazy river has a very rough surface. Long lines and VERY EXPENSIVE food.",Jennifer C
50,FUN!,Not really suited for younger children since there are height restrictions on many of the slides. Lines tend to get long. Food is expensive. Waterproof camera is a must!!!,librabunny82
20,Poor customer relations,"This waterpark would have been great if all of the slides had been available. Unfortunately, three of the major slides were closed for maintenance and we were told they would be open sometime this summer. This was not noted on their web site. Because of these closures the lines at all of the other slides were looong...Guest relations refused giving any type of compensation, i.e. front of line passes, food, etc. Manager Eric was not interested in making happy customers. Oh, and the wave pool had no wave.",Kelly H
30,Average but nice,Not over crowded so there was plenty of open space. All the kids seemed to be having a great time...what a surprise...hahaha,564jeff
10,Terrible Irresponsible Theme Park,This park had workers that said it was their second day open but it was a disaster. Granddaughter had her foot slip between the slot in the HARD resin lounge chair and it cut her foot and bruised the entire leg. The first aid worker and his coworker were more interested in arguing about the over time they worked the day before than attending to my granddaughter. The food booths were not open with the exception of a few. The staff stated it was because of the small amount of visitors (???) they didn't see why they would open them. I stated that the entrance fees did not reflect food booths and most of the rides being closed. The pools were filthy and the life guards were mostly friendly but also some rude ones.. I'll never go back even if it was free.,Cee-Jay B
10,Parking is the the worse!!,"Parking (-5/5) They charge you $15.00 to park in dirt lots that are far from the entrance. The tram system is so bad!! They have a few units that get full very quickly. These trams can carry about 30 people while there are thousands of attendees!! After waiting for 20 minutes are the tram stop, most of the people (about 200 of us) decided to walk to the gate. The walk was almost 2 miles!!! On the way there, one tram passed us carrying about 30 people. Seriously?!Food (1/5) We bought a package online which included entrance fee and food. After waiting for 30 min in line (by the way, there is a line for everything...ticketing, food, rides, bathrooms, parking, etc.), we got these chicken strips that taste and look like rubber sandals. Gross!!Cleanliness (-5/5) There is so much debris in the water. The cleaning crew is non-existent. The staff include a bunch of high school students that neither care for the attendees nor the condition of the place. We were there for over 3-hours and I saw one guy picking up trash. When we were in the the ""lazy river"", there was trash and leafs floating by. Disgusting!! The lifeguards just stand there and do nothing.The rides (1/5) We were in the wave pool for about 15 minutes when everyone was kicked out. We went to the lazy river and was in there for about 10 minutes when everyone was kicked out again. We thought they did this to clean the pool and river but nope. It was a dirty as before.Price (1/5) They gouge you for everything besides the entrance fees. The $40 (fast pass) plus $15 (parking) plus $15 (locker) plus food could cost you over $100 per person.The lines (1/5) It could take you up to an hour to wait in line for one slide. Imagine your kids standing there dripping wet for an hour! The staff could not care or less.Where do you sit? (1/5) They have a feel tables where you can set your stuff down. Either wise, you have to end up sitting in the grass. If you want to rent one of their cabanas, it will cost you anywhere from $150 to $200!! These so-called cabanas are basically cement cubicles with a table and some chairs. Ghetto much!! For $200.00?!!Safety/Security (1/5) Non-existent. I saw a few unarmed rent-a-cop with absolutely no concerns about the attendees. They stand around talking and joking with each other like it's some party. Remember the dirt parking lots? No security.",jt99941
10,Not good for families,This place is so dirty. We went when it opened so it should have been cleaned up from the day before. Not so. Piles of trash every where. Over crowded so not a good place to let your kids run around unless you are standing right next to them. Food is very over priced as in $10 for a hamburger,Tanya B
50,Fun!,This is a really fun place to take the family and its great for kids. The price is well worth it. Can't wait to bring the grandchildren next year! I'm thinking about having my granddaughter's birthday party here next year. Thanks for the blast,shelliavalos
50,Its very fun........,"Went to Raging Waters today with a group of 5 friends (plus myself) and had an issue with our tickets. We were told by 2 different employees that they could do nothing to help us (one cashier and one supervisor) and we were left to figure it out on our own till the park manager, Anthony came out to help us out. He was completely understanding and really did everything he could to make us happy and enjoy our visit. Because of Anthony I had an amazing day with all of my friends at Raging Waters. I gained a lot of respect for Raging Waters and their employees because of Anthony. Thank you again!",Spavisitor87

And I enjoying play water slide with my friend son 10 year old,also all worker in there very nice and friendly, and the guard in the swimming pool area they eyes very good (they watching all the time) and they enable to help people at anytime.",ianche
50,EXCELLENT!!!,"Raging Waters is THE BOMB!!! WE LOVE IT. Bill at Ted went surfing here all the time and I can't wait til I can, too.",MandieBeeee
30,Too many people,We went in september and there were too many people. Since they advertize on their folder that they are the biggest water theme park in Cali i expected bigger slides. When we went a few slides were also closed and we still had to pay the full entrance fee. Its fun but not worth the money. They also ask 12 dollars for a locker and 15 for a parking space.,Pieter C
30,Smart Day seemed to mean many rides closed,"Went on a ""Smart Day"" and many of the attractions were closed. Amazon Adventure didn't open until 2pm. Thunder Rapids, Dragons Den and the Little Dipper all closed. Even though the park felt quiet with many things closed we still had to queue for a lot of the rides. I'd hate to go on a busy day. We did enjoy it (hence average not poor), but don't go expecting anything amazing!",KarenLMasters
30,Distinctly average,"Nice water park however a few questionable issues! Park opens at 10 yet most slides don't open until at 11. There are 3 broke rides within the park, and a colleague in the park told us there always broken. New Aqua rocket ride is really good. Some rides have weight restrictions and the scales do not work at the start of the ride so you have to queue to the top only to be told you can't ride. Would go elsewhere in the future.",Superdryers
30,Dated waterpark but still very fun,"This is the first time my family and I have visited this water park. My boys (1 and 3) both had a lot of fun. They have a kid section called Kids Kingdom that only allow kids under 48 inches to use the structures. Anyone can play in the water but they can't ride down the slides. The park looks dated like it hasn't been updated since the 90s. Seems like teenagers are running the park holding their 48 inch poles to check height and whistles to blow at people's faces who exceed that height. They seem to have fun enforcing it. We rented a cabana for the day ($150 which can hold 6 people) and it was well worth it. You have a dedicated server all day helping everyone in the cabanas in your section. They can take your food orders/vouchers for you and bring your food over to you when it's ready. I've read a lot of complaints about waiting in long lines and this perk definitely saved us. Overall, my kids had a great time and they could care less if paint was peeling or faded and couldn't tell if anything looked old.",UGoOli
30,Many shortcomings,"Good points:1. Relatively short queues due to kids being back at school2. Slides are satisfactoryBad points:1. Miserable staff2. Dirty3. Unsanitary restrooms4. Major bee problem5. $12-20 is extortionate to rent a locker for the day6. Unsafe-lots of grab rails loose and almost falling off7. Lots of slides closed8. Slides open at different times (why?!)9. Paths hurt your feet due to stones and the sun being hot, why not cool paths?10. No cooling fans in queues11. Not enough sun beds;-)",Bobbyhols
10,"Don't Go - Unsafe, Poorly Run & Should Be Closed",I live in the San Dimas area and have unfortunately seen this park go downhill year after year. It could have been great but management has allowed it to become dirty and unsafe. They do not train any of their high school young employees plus the food prices are ridiculous. Please do yourself a favor and go to a different water park.,alominac
10,Save your money and time. You will only leave frustrated and upset.,"This was the worst day ever. From the moment we arrived at the parking area that was absolutely filthy. Once inside, that park itself was dirty and chaotic. We started the day off at the kids kingdom with kids getting hurt left and right from others launching out of the slides and knocking people over. I understand that this could happen but there was no worker in sight to warn others not to walk there to avoid being hurt. Both of my children were injured. When it was time for lunch we headed to the pizza area.... we literally stood in line for 40 minutes and it did not move an inch. We decided that we had enough of the wait and went upstairs to the Carl's Jr/Green Onion. When ordering the kids cheeseburgers, I asked to have them plain (they are kids!) and the woman absolutely refused. I asked to upgrade their drinks to shakes, she refused. Then I asked for lemonade...she said there were ""out"" Whatever... so then I go to order some nachos and she cuts me off saying that only burgers and chicken are available..... I am so completely frustrated by this point that I just order cheeseburgers ""however they make it"" When I get up to the window even that was all wrong. She put the wrong order in. When we sit down the kids are crying because there is mustard (NOT SOMETHING YOU CAN REMOVE) and they couldn't even eat their burgers.... fries and Sierra Mist it was for lunch. Seriously the worst customer service and experience ever. I will not be returning and I am informing everyone I know what they can expect here..... seriously not even worth the Groupon cost.",Nikki
30,Overall Fun,"We thought ahead and bought a fast-pass but out of the 9 rides that were eligible, only 6 rides were open. The rest were broken and closed. Aqua-Rocket was great and we kept going back, however drop-out there was a long line. The longest line was for the food and since we pre-paid we thought it would be an easy process but we waited for a full hour for Carl's Jr. Had I known, I would have gone to Sharky's.",David B
10,Disappointing Day Trip,"Besides the park being extremely run down and dirty, they also ran out of bottled waters by 11:30. The lines for the food were ridiculously long. We bought meal vouchers prior to entering for $14.99. None of the combo meals even cost this much. There was not enough seating so we had to rent a cabana. It was a total waste of money.",Dani A
10,NEVER AGAIN!! DO SOAK CITY INSTEAD.,"First of all, it really takes a lot to make us unhappy or complain. We have worked in retail in the past and hate to be that ""unhappy customer"" but this just crossed a line.We should of known to turn back when we pulled up and had to park on a mound of dirt, then saw yellow school buses being used to transport people closer to the park. The ride for said bus was ridiculous; at least an hour wait. So we did what almost everyone was doing and decided to just walk. It took about 20 minutes or so; but that was our decision.We had ordered our tickets online to try and save time. But the line to just have them scan the ticket was just as long as the line to purchase tickets. We probably waited about 30 minutes or so to get in. What you'd expect though really on a Sunday in August.We've been to Soak City multiple times in the past and had a great experience there, so decided that we'd give a different water park a try. Soak City has multiple places to lounge and watch your children play; as soon as we walked into Raging Waters there was nowhere we could sit or put our stuff. They had a very small seating area with sun loungers (about 15 of them) that obviously were taken already. Everything was very crowded together and there was just no seating. So we had to spend $12 on a small locker (frustrating when you also just spent $15 to park). But again, you half expect it when you come to these places. Oh, there was also a huge line for the lockers. The lady guided us to downstairs where there was more, and we stood in an even longer line (which is right by the bathrooms so that creates a huge jam for anyone trying to get in / out.. go figure).We then stood in line to grab a drink and an ice-cream. First place we went to sold ICE's so we thought we'd grab one. Only 3 of the 12 flavors were working. So we went on to get an ice cream and soda. Stood in line for 45 minutes for a soda only - the ice cream and churro place were both closed. Really? On a busy Sunday? After waiting 45 minutes in the heat (there's no shade while you're in line; or infact anywhere in the park), we finally got 2 soda's and a packet of chips (for about $12).My husband and step daughter stood inline for the first slide and honestly waited well over 2 hours. The ridiculous thing is that when you start lining there's no indicator of how long you can expect to wait. And until you've waited a good time do you realize just how slow the line is going.At 4o'clock we decided to grab some lunch in the hopes that the lines had hopefully slowed down. We headed up to the deck area for Carls Jr hoping it would be the quickest. We got in line at 4o'clock, by 4:45pm we had just ordered and we finally received the food at 5:45pm. I wish I could say I was exaggerating but unfortunately I was not. 1 hour and 45 minutes was beyond ridiculous for ""fast food""! It would be a little more understandable if the line was ridiculously long and therefore we knew what we were getting into, but the line had about 20 people and honestly did not move. I can't even begin to give an explanation.. because there isn't one. Our poor 3 year old just wanted his drink (which was also part of the 1 hour and 45 minute wait). By this point, we only had just over an hour till the park closed. We were pretty fed up at this point and just wanted to leave. I should also add that a gentleman in front of us asked to complain to the manager and out strolled a boy who honestly looked about 19. He looked gormlessly at him and all the staff in there just turned around staring like they were shocked he was complaining (REALLY!?) instead of just doing what they needed to do to get the line moving!I should also add that we didn't see 1 person cleaning the park in the entire time we were there, or for the 2 + hours that we were sat waiting for and eating our food. Not 1 person cleaned the tables or mopped the floors (which were disgusting).We've been to a lot of parks and theme parks in our time and this is by far the worst. We would NEVER return!! The slides were okay.. but we got TWO slides done in the entire day (11am - 7pm) because we were waiting in line for everything so long! For the price of the entry that was $100 a ride!! AVOID at all costs!! As I mentioned Soak City was really good on every occasion we've been there and we'd go back there in a heartbeat over this place. It almost seemed as though they were understaffed; with the lines and so many things being closed (a lot of the slides were closed too), which seems crazy in such a huge place like that. The staff we did see were very laid back and chilled out; no rush what so ever.This review isn't for the staff or the owners / management; because they won't care; they'll still get their money at the end of the day. It's for anyone who's considering visiting - I strongly would advise against it! We didn't enjoy anything about the day!Oh, and when you're finally fed up and just want to leave you have to wait ages for the tram back to the car (unless you want to walk again)!",kcustard_uk
50,Good first time experience,I guess it all depends on what day you go luckily for me I went on a very good day it wasn't over crowded the staff was fabulous my nieces had the time of their lives and all of us grownups did as well I'm sorry to all the other reviewers who unfortunately didn't had a memorable time but for us it was thrills beyond our expectations,AjNunez90210
10,Don't go!! Queue park not a water park! Waste of money!,"Avoid this place like the plague! It is a Queue Park NOT a Water Park!! Visited mid week, took half hour to finally get in, then had to queue over an hour for two slides, ridiculous. We entered at 11.00am and finally gave up and left the place at 3pm, $200 wasted, never again! Lines were so long we witnessed a child urinating in the line so as not to loose their place. Complained to management who said that long lines were acceptable on busy days! Obviously made worse by the fact that three popular slides were closed and the wave pool packed up at 2pm. Be warned you will not get value for money in this location.",lprecious123
10,Disappointed...next time it won't be here,"We were at the park today July 18th. It began to rain and thunderstorm. We waited for over an hour for the X treme slide. We were at the top about to ride and they closed the ride. We asked if we could come back when the ride opened and not have to wait. We were told ""no"". Where is the customer satisfaction? Then we went to have Jamba Juice and the girl serving us was rude. It was obvious she didn't want to be there. Overall, we were disappointed with the park operations and staff. We drove 3 hours to go to this park. We won't be coming back anytime soon.",Lynn F
30,"It's a water park, and summer. What's not to enjoy!","I bought the season pass. The park has some fun rides and a wave pool.. There's a great two-sided area for both small kids and those ""in-beween"" kids. This was great for keeping track of our three lil ones age 5 to 11. There's also an area more for babies to preschoolers with slides and and a climber. The individual ticket price is a bit steep. There seems to be quite a few rides that are not open when we go. There are plenty of food choices, but the cost is quite high. You cannot bring outside food. $15 to park. $12 locker rentals. Staff is helpful. Plenty of chairs available for a nice relaxing afternoon. (sun or shade, or on the sand).",prncess803
50,WONDERFUL RIDES,I am hydrophobic and I am so scared with any water activities. But we were bunch of people and they were all telling me to go which I did. I guess I have tried most of the scary rides but I should say wonderful rides. It gave me so much fun and now I believe I have overcome my fears. This place is fabulous for all ages. What a wonderful day in summer we had. Will definitely come back.,AJP242
30,Great Fun But Very Expensive,"Lots of fun for kids and teens. $40 a day each person. $15 to park. $12 for lockerFood is outrageously expensive. Makes it very difficult if one adult takes a few young kids. To be dropped off instead of parking, is a bit of a walk to the front gate. Yes its a fun place but its very expensive overall.",Ninee
50,Summer Time,"It is a wonderful Water Park to take the family and friends to, to have a good relaxing and fun even if you don't want to get wet.",TSgtDennisReed
20,A huge disappointment,"Finding the place was a pain. We went according to the GPS and there was a gate that said ""Employees only. Use Raging Waters Dr"" and no other info which way is the place. Had to ask around for directions and went all the way around a few miles. And we ended up at the same gate on the other side!! So we went around for nothing :)Parking lot had a couple of men with stacks of cash collecting 15 dollars per vehicle. We asked if they accept CCs and they let us in for free. Nice gesture, but shady business. I think they don't give receipts for cash either.They offer ""bring a friend for free"" with a season pass, but this is not valid on the same day. Not sure if it's ok if you buy it online a day before, or you still need to wait a day after one use.Anyway. There's no bang for the buck. If you want thrill, go to Six Flags, if you want water, waves and sand, go to the beach!Rides. The tallest and steepest ride was closed. All other rides suck and are for children mostly. The lines were short (we went on Wednesday, a slow day) and they were really slow as well :) had go wait for ~45 mins per ride. Don't know what happens on Saturdays... Funny moment: they have a special line for single riders. I tried it once and even though there were like 8 people in the line, we waited longer than the regular line (noticed that people who came after me went on first), because they wouldn't fit us in anywhere. So this wait was also about 45 minutes.Then the lazy river was closed in the afternoon. Not sure why, but heard rumors that somebody pood in the water :)Also, they say that the park opens at 10, but the rides did not open till after 11 except one newest ride that was open from the beginning.We didn't have kids so we didn't have anything to do there and got bored quickly. And we went there to see what ""the largest waterpark in California"" looks like :) now we know.",Dani
50,Business Traveler,Great Hotel.. very clean and staff is outstanding. Safe area to be in and lots of food choices. Enjoy the warm hot tub after a long day of work was very nice... We look forward to staying here again soon.,zooba13
40,It's Hard To Not Like This Place,"A very compact, yet large water park. I like the fact that you don't have to walk far to the next ride or slide. There's a big variety of all level of slides. I don't go on Drop Out...and almost five story straight drop. But my son loves it. I prefer the lazy river and a ride called The Black Hole.They are very clean and family friendly and have an excellent area for babies and toddlers. This park has been around a long time and it's one of the best water parks in California.",kewlbreezes51
30,Long in the tooth,"This place REALLY needs a face lift. It's not dangerous, and it is still fun. I don't believe anything new has been added in quite some time, and what is there looks old.",Michael G
30,"Good variety of slides, but not run in the greatest way.","I went to Raging Waters in the summer of 2013 to check it out for myself, and I could say they do have a variety of cool slides. High Extreme II, Drop Out, Vortex, The Speed Slides, the Bermuda Triangle, Neptune's Fury, Tunnel of Terror and the other family raft ride were all a lot of fun. My gripes: Single riders are not treated very fairly on rides like Dragon's Den, Dark Hole or Tunnel of Terror. On the family raft ride and Neptune's Fury, groups of three are usually cool enough to let you join them, but for the other three I mentioned above which require double riders, if you are at the park by yourself (a mistake I made) or an odd number in your group you might have to beg other park guests to take a ride with you if you want to ride (which feels like pulling teeth). If you come through the line single, forget it. You will be turned away from these attractions. Raging Waters needs to take some lessons from Disney on incorporating single rider lines and pairing people up. I have found that most people, especially older, more mature people generally don't mind riding with a perfect stranger (I don't). With that being said, be sure to pair up ahead of time if you plan on riding any attractions that require two or more riders. And if you are travelling by yourself, your time is better spent elsewhere.",Mike F
50,kids had a blast,"ok - I read all the reviews before booking this for my son's 12th birthday....that being said, we had a great time. I read the reviews about it being ""crowded, outdated, expensive, and long lines""....so here's what we did...1)I reserved the last weekend of summer....kids were all back in school so we didn't have to deal with the reviews that were posted from July and August reviewers who felt that the price wasn't worth it given the crowds.2) reserving in September also was a bonus because they were offering 4 packs for $99. This price lowered the admission to $24.99 per guest.3)End of summer reservation - crowds were less so we didn't need the fast pass (although, I would have purchased if needed) and we also didn't need a cabana.4)I opted to do the meal plan so the kids could all go eat where they wanted and get the desserts that they wanted.5)...I might have considered not getting the meal tickets if I had thought about just waiting until I got there and ordered a pizza for $33....I saw many people who had done this. This would have saved me even more money if I had thought of it.6) kids didn't even notice that some of the slides are a little past their prime, kids had a blast. We stayed from the time the park opened until the time that the park closed.7) cabanas - the cool ones are the ones on the sand. We had a palm tree and surf board in front of ours and it was like our ""house"" for the day.We are going back next summer....",SeaCaroline
20,Fading raging waters.,"Not impressed. Dirty, very limited numbers of showers, no towel hire, no where no get changed, people having to change in very dirty toilets and around the park. The water was freezing despite it being at the end of an unusually hot week. Safety procedures, equipment and supervision very poor. The general site is run down, not just because it's the end of the season it shows several years of minimal maintenance and investment.The wave machine is a ripple rather than a wave and the inflatable tubes are dirty with sub cream.The whole park appears to be run by youngsters, food service is very slow. Car parking and locker hire costs are extortionate. Commercial radio playing so loud you can't have a conversation with the person next to you.",H..
30,"Outdated and dirty, but rides were lots of fun",Went midweek to avoid long lines. Would never go here on weekends with family unless your pay double to include fast pass. Many of the rides need maintenance and painting. Looks and feels outdated. Bathrooms are filthy. Cabanas are expensive considering how basic and spartan they feel. For $150 you should get higher end chairs and privacy.,Henri I
50,Be a big kid at a big park,I still after all these years living close to Raging Waters can't get enough of it. I fell like a big kid every time i go. I love the placement of the park in the San Dimas Canyon area. Love it.,RayManhattan
20,Save Your Money!!! Too Crowded!!!,"Our family of five visited Raging Waters on Sunday August 17th during a visit to Southern California.I should say I did visit this park about 5 years ago and had a pretty good time. We thought a visit to the water park might be a nice break from Disneyland. Big mistake as this place was way too crowded. It took over an hour per to get onto any slide in the park. We toughed it out for a little over three hours and managed only to ride three slides. Seems that they do not limit the number of people entering the park. Combine that with premium passes being sold for an additional $20 - $30 each that allow front of the line access and it makes it almost impossible to get on a slide using general admission. When you add the cost of parking and locker rental to your admission it was $210 for our family. When you do the math it worked out to approximately $14 per slide. Not a very good value. I certainly would not recommend this attraction to others.I should also mention that the upkeep on the park could use some attention. Water features that were operational on my last trip were not working and seemed to be run down. Also, the general tidiness of the park was lacking as there were plenty of cans and bottles laying around that seemed to have been there for awhile.",66sahara
30,Biggest but not the best,"I expected much more when they say its the biggest on the west coast.Maybe it is but the waterparks in east of San Fran and the Silverwood waterpark in Idaho are much much better.However those are nowhere near so this is what you get, not sure of other choices in SoCal.Prices are reasonable, but tired of paying to park uuughh!You can bring in water but not soft drinks.The Amazon lazy river float needs many more tubes to get instead of waiting endlessly.Food is reasonable.Lockers are $8.",WelcomeMat
10,TOO CROWDED TO GET ON ANY RIDES!!,I went on 8/16 and brought 15 of my friends for a day at the waterpark. I would probably never go back unless it was during the week. Expect over an hour wait on EVERY slide!! Even the lazy river was packeked and couldnt get any intertube for over 30 mins! They really should do a cutoff of tickets or something so people could actually get on a ride. It was so freaking hot people were getting sick and laying down in the car!,Hadar F
50,Very large water park with the best slides in California. Avoid in the peak of summer.,"It's really funny when you read the negative reviews from people who went on a weekend or peak weekday in the middle of the summer. You really want to avoid this place for most of August. This is an area of S. California where millions of people live. Going in the peak of summer is a bad idea. Best times to visit Raging Waters is in May, early June, or after Labor Day. May the force be with you if you go on a Saturday in July or August. The slides are really fun! Even with no lines it takes a long time to ride them all. Dropout is the best slide in my opinion. Its scares the hell out of you when you catch air off the drop. Parking is $15 and only a shock if you're not from California. The food inside is expensive. I think the best value for 3-4 people is getting the whole pizza. I think with drinks it works out to $40. $10 a person for food isn't bad and that was enough for the whole day. When you're on the slides all day you want to eat light. Hogging an ice cream, pizza, churro, and a coke is bad news. Go right at the beginning of the season and have the best day ever. If its a peak time get the H20 pass so you really don't hate life.",Lumerian
30,It's Soak-kay - flooded with long lines & high prices,"We went there in middle of week (Weds.) and the lines to get on rides was ridiculous - most of our time spent waiting in line! NOT just due to the summer crowds either.PROBLEMS:1) Inefficiently operated - they don't have spare rafts/inflatables ready to go - instead you have to wait for person(s) to come off slide and hand over (that adds a lot of time). And the time intervals between each rider going on ride and coming off ride takes several minutes (that adds up).2) Place is 30 yrs. old and shows - very run down. Wood structures supporting rides and slides (under and top) - show age (faded, peeling, dripping, rusting, you name it). Landscaping - a mish mosh of overgrown plantings. Cleanliness - a lot of trash laying around that was discarded at lines. Outdoor dining areas - need a facelift.3) Dining - they are very strict about NO outside food being brought in (they confiscate it). And of course the fast food places (the only choice for food/drink in park) are ridiculously overpriced.NOTE:We enjoyed the rides well enough once got on! But considering they lasted probably 2 minutes or less and we waited in line about an hour for 2 of the rides - hard to be very enthusiastic. We were at park from about 11:30 am - 7 pm and went on about 7 rides total. Took about 45 min. break for lunch. That should give you an idea.BOTTOM LINE: Happy to take the kids once but won't be returning anytime soon. Between admission cost, parking fees, food expense - a small fortune for family of 5 and way overpriced given the problems stated above.",Jotripplanner
20,Wow...,"Created an account especially for this. This is the worst and smallest waterpark I've ever been to. And I've been to quite a few around the world. I would have given this park just one star, if it weren't for the cool slides. This park was so crammed with people that I couldn't even enjoy being in the water. And it wasn't even weekend! There are only two small pools to actually swim in, and they feel like you're in a traffic jam. Unfortunately I'm not exaggerating. (A wave pool and a small lazy river.)This park is crazy expensive. Not only because you'll need parking ($15 cash only) and a locker ($12 for smallest), but because you NEED their H2Go Premium option ($30). If you don't buy this, prepare to wait in line for 1,5 hour per slide, not kidding. Even with H2Go Premium you have to wait a long time. I even saw a woman crying in line because she waited almost two hours for a 10 second slide and saw H2Go people walk right past her. Fun and relaxing day at a waterpark, right?The staff at the slides are incredibly lazy, inefficient and don't care about the huge lines. I would not have been able to go on all slides if it weren't for my H2Go watch. I won't come back to this park, ever. Spend your money elsewhere! Even a simple local pool would be a better and cheaper option.",Patrick877
30,Meh.,"Took my 10 year old nephew to this water park today. He was more impressed than I was (he'd give it three stars, I'd give it two, so we'll go with three because he's the target customer). First of all, the place needs a paint job, landscaping, and a good cleaning. The shade canopies above the queues were filthy and full of decaying leaves. The paint is peeling all over the park. Chunks of plaster are missing from the bottom of the pool (chews up your feet!) And the planted areas are full of dead landscaping and lots of weeds. I hurt my elbow on the first attraction we tried. To their credit, about a million lifeguards came to rescue me (for a bruised elbow, that was some response!) I thought the slides were uncomfortable and jarring, but the kid loved every one. Well, the five we were able to use in the six hours we were there: the park was so packed it took about an hour to wait for each slide. And can we talk about the food? GROSS! My nephew talked about their buffalo wings all morning, and they were out by noon. We opted for pizza. They gave us two burned slices. I said something, and they said we could keep our burned ones and gave us new pizza... that was so doughy and undercooked I couldn't eat it.So the verdict? Lower your expectations, do not go on a weekend, and bring your own food!",brenf8
30,Wait ridiculous amounts of time for everything.,Came here on a busy weekend so I knew I would be doing a lot if waiting but holy crap. Just getting inside with our tickets in hand that we had purchased online was a huge ordeal. Everyone is funneled into this tiny 4 or 5 line entrance. It is really badly organized. No changing rooms either. As son as we got in line for a ride we decided to purchase the h2go pass for an extra $25 which is well worth it especially since we were a group of 8. At the end of the day we got to ride almost everything once. All in all. It's ok but I won't be going back anytime soon,brandonian442
50,Great water park,This water park has it all. Great food. Great rides. Great staff. Now it does lack a lot of the cosmetic appeal of other water parks but the multitude of rides makes up for this deficiency.,CEOLARRYWILLIAMS

40,better than expected,"This was our first time to Raging Waters. I read through a number of reviews on TA to get an idea what to prepare for and it was very helpful, I would recommend it. We followed all the advice about food, where to park, when to go. However, some of the reviews were so negative about the park that I was pleasantly surprised that Raging Waters is actually better than I expected. I think the poorer reviews here are just because the expectations were a hotel benchmark for cleanliness and comfort. And that is just not possible. It's an amusement park with lots of people from different socioeconomic backgrounds and ages and when you put so many diverse people in any one place, you should know what you're getting yourself into. Having said that...The positives: the place is pretty clean, even the bathrooms, I wasn't grossed out by anything I saw or smelled. They seemed to be maintained well all day. The visitors/tourists were overall pretty nice and friendly. I went on the Flow Rider ride (a wave simulation-type ride) for the first time and wiped out a few times, and the other riders and the ride operators were nice and encouraging. The rides seemed well maintained and staff seemed careful to keep things safe and fun. The lines were longer for some rides (30 minutes for Neptune and it was not worth it), but other rides, we waited only 5 minutes, even when it was sunny. The whole park is laid out quite well and when we visited on a summer day, it wasn't actually as difficult as I thought to find shaded seats. Loved most of the rides, and the younger kids in our group loved the children areas. Lots of creative ways to play with water there.The price of food is expensive but similar to any theme park, but the park makes it much easier than others to bring your own food. You just can't bring it in, but you can easily eat it outside. And while I heard about people spending hundreds for lunch, you can easily get a hotdog for less than 10 bucks each.The whole park is relatively small compared to others so you are always just 5-10 minutes away from your locker, from your chairs, from your car (if you parked nearby). Many reviewers suggested to get to the park early so we did, but I found that even getting there at the open or later, there was still plenty of parking near the entrance.The negatives: lockers are overpriced. $10 for a tiny one and $20 for a slightly bigger one seemed pretty outrageous. Also, parking is way overpriced, more than other parks. There is also a weird feature of having to walk barefoot around the park. When the sun is out, the ground is too hot to walk on, and the ground sometimes has dirt/sand so your feet will hurt unless you have the aqua shoes. If you use flip-flops/sandals, you can't wear them on the ride so you are forced to leave them somewhere or hold them on the ride, it is just a strange aspect of being at a water park. You are also quite cold in between rides. While the water temperature of rides is fine, when you're outside dripping wet often without a dry towel, especially if it's not sunny out, you are freezing. Best to go on days that will have at least some sun especially in the afternoon.On sunny days, it is difficult to shade your eyes from the sun and UV. You can't wear any eye wear on rides so you likely won't have sunglasses with you, just too inconvenient. Also, you can't carry sunscreen around with you and so you can easily burn unless you go back to reapply sunscreen at your locker often.Another funny thing is not knowing the time. It can be easy to get lost and lose your group because no one knows what time is it or even has their cell phone so you should definitely set up a ""home base"" meeting place at the beginning, which is something helps everyone know where to find others in case you somehow get separated. We found it easy to just leave our things at a nice shady spot though, there's lots of chairs and benches and even shaded grassy areas.Finally, another negative which was also mentioned on TA was the fact that several rides require two people. We had an odd number of people in our group so it made it difficult because we would either have to separate our group or someone couldn't go with us.Overall, we had an awesome time at Raging Waters and would definitely go back. It is great for the whole family and while weekends may be crazy, you should definitely go for a weekday and even when the sun is not out, it is fine because then your feet won't hurt from the hot pavement and eyes damaged from UV. But just set your expectations right and follow some simple advice and you'll have a great experience at a fraction of the cost of Disneyland.",mrmiguelito
30,no changing rooms,"Went to this park with high expectations, immediately I was shocked that they have NO changing rooms.... I was told 'just get changed in the restrooms', so I had to get changed in this disgusting not clean restroom cubicle ! absolutely disgusting, what kind of water park doesn't have changing rooms?Lockers - you have to pay $10 for a tiny one person one, $20 + for bigger ones, and you don't get the money back (what a scam).Food - as usual rip off the tourists, if you wanted to order a Full pizza which was about the same size as a large Dominos it was $33 !!! one slice was $6.99, plus tax. It tasted great though.Slides - awesome, loved the slides, however the QUEUES!!!! horrific, after suffering mind numbing boredom for 30 minutes per ride, twice, i said 'never again'. So i just went and paid another $20 which I couldn't afford to get a pass which meant I could skip the lines. Once I had that pass I thought great my problems are solved.... Except they weren't because most rides you need 2 people, i was going on my own because the person i went with just wanted to swim and wasnt into slides.... so i was told 'you cant come on this ride unless you find someone'. I had to suggest to the person that they could find someone else on there own and pair us up (they should have suggested that themselves), they did and usually it worked although it was annoying so I tried to avoid rides that were not one person at a time from then on. I really enjoyed the slides and the rapids.Overall it was good, but DO NOT GO if you don't want to pay another $20 to skip the lines, you'll have a horrible time. Also don't go if you dislike disgusting restrooms that you have to get changed in. Those things aside I had fun.",pittuk23
30,"Great slides, long lines","There are a few really fantastic and fairly unique slides at Raging Waters, but the lines are long and slow even on a weekday. The wave pool and kids areas looked quite fun as well if you're looking for something a little slower. The lazy river didn't look quite as good as the one in Legoland's water park. Food and drinks are VERY expensive (like all parks) so we always pack a cooler with lunch and drinks and head out to the parking lot for a car picnic, with a wrist stamp you can re-enter the park. If you don't want to wait in lines you can pay extra for an H2O Go pass, which is a waterproof watch looking thing that allows you to reserve times at popular rides or go to the front of the line. There is a remarkably good amount of shade while waiting in lines which was great.",DeniseMW
30,Dirty park,"I went with my fiancé to this park on a Wednesday. I expected that there will be packed but the waiting time was insane. We only did a few rides and the pool are really dirty. Moreover the customer service is really bad. At the entrance, you need to pay parking only in cash and the staff could barely help me with the direction for the ATM. The food is really bad and the servers are really slow.",Julie M
50,Great way to keep cool,"Great fun place to go! Solo, couples, family with small children to adult children. Great place for work pick nicks. So many different areas from small people to adults! Great safe place to come and spend the day & have a blast!Fun. Fun. Fun!Enjoy!!!!",WSJSS
30,Lots of fun,It was a great visit the whole family had a great time. $15 for parking and you're only allowed to take water into the park. TAKE WATER INTO THE PARK. The drinks are ridiculously overpriced at this park. Definitely budget @ least $15 per person per meal. Food was alright but not the draw to the park. Park was clean. Staff was courteous and on point with their lifeguard duties. All the family had a blast and will be back again.,Pjcruces
40,Pretty cool waterpark,"After reading these reviews, it seems like Raging Waters can be hit or miss. We had a good time, the lines weren't too long, and the rides were fun. My tips would be to go on a weekday when the California kids are still in school (they break late June - August for summer), and get there when the park opens so you can park right away and be close to your car. This is key because you can leave a cooler or at least some water in your car and go out to the parking lot to get your snacks and save yourself the fortune it will cost you to eat at the park. I saw one of the food vendors selling a 16"" pizza for $36.99, ummm no. There were people in the parking lot firing up camping grills and busting out folding chairs and just having a big ol lunch, that's the way to do it. The other thing that they push is the H2GO pass, I think it is roughly an additional $20/ticket for the pass and it gets you through the lines faster. From what I saw when I went on Friday, June 27, this pass would not be necessary. We were able to do every slide/attraction in the park and we were outta there after 5 hours. Also, if you're going at a less busy time of year, don't bother with their expensive cabana rental - there was plenty of lawn chairs and shaded areas to sit, we left our towels and beach bag on a lawn chair and it was undisturbed all day. The staff were all pleasant, helpful and friendly, we had absolutely no issues there. It's a big waterpark with a lot of unique rides, but in all honesty I think Hurricane Harbor is a better California waterpark.",Holiday S

40,Still a fun way to cool off.,"I had not been to Raging Waters in atleast a deacade and have been wanting to check it out because it is only 5 minutes from our house. My parents would drop us off as kids and I only have fond memories of the place. We have gone about 10 times this summer and have been very happy. My 3.5 year old daughter and our almost 2 year old love to splash in the little dipper section (only for little kids) then transition to the wave pool. I must say this has made them fearless to go in the ocean. Only a few weeks ago my daughter was screaming when I took her for a paddle on my longboard in Laguna. Now she was swimming in the same coves, with her floaty, as well as laughing and smiling riding some waves or her little foam board. I can only attribute this to how much wave/water time she has accumulated at RW. To wrap things up I highly recommend this park for little ones and I personally love it because the ""Flow Rider"". Nothing like surfing but sure is good fun without the hour drive.",sitkaspuce77
10,Unprofessional and Unpatriotic,"I live in the area, and you can see from my previous review, this place has gone downhill. My last review a few years back was top notch. Apparently Raging Waters has been bought by a different corporation, thus it is NOT what it used to be.I have a special needs son, with a special diet. Thus, according to the law, we are allowed to bring in food for our son. Security checked our bags at the entrance and told me no outside food is allowed in the park. I explained that my son has special dietary needs, and legally we are entitled to carry the food he needs to eat. The security guard once again told me no outside food. I then asked to speak to his supervisor because this kid did NOT know the law. He told me he was the supervisor. The kid was maybe twenty years old, and he was the supervisor? I tried to remain calm and remind him of the ADA and other laws that applied, and once again he told me no outside food allowed in the park, but we could get our hand stamped and go eat in the parking lot if we wanted. That is blatantly illegal, and simple naivete. In the end, I don't think the kid was trying to discriminate against people with special needs, I honestly don't think he knows the law. The disturbing part of this is that he's the supervisor.A few hours later, after leaving my contraband food in the car I was walking around the water park without my shirt. In a different life I was a Marine Corp Scout Sniper, and I proudly bare my tattoo. I was stopped by security and asked to cover the tattoo because it appeared to be gang related. I explained the tattoo was from the gang known as the USMC, so the kid called for a supervisor to help resolve the issue. My ""friend"" the ""supervisor"" that did not allow me to bring in my son's diet showed up. I tried to be professional about the situation, but in the end, I was asked to cover the USMC tattoo or leave.Do the kids working security mean to discriminate against special needs children and their veteran fathers? Honestly I don't think so. Unfortunately Raging Waters has been bought out by a larger corporation who is concerned about the bottom line at the expense of training their employees. I appreciate that Raging Waters does not allow gang tattoos in the park. But a two hour training session for the kids running security would easily enable these kids to be able to differentiate between a gang tattoo and a military tattoo. Also, by law I am allowed to carry special food for my son to meet his dietary needs. When I visit Disneyland, Knotts and other amusement parks, security always finds the food. I explain my situation, or they see my son, and they tell me to have a nice day, and send me on my way with my son's food. Unfortunately Raging Waters does NOT train their security staff, so you end up with untrained teenagers patrolling the park. Raging Waters is saving money hiring these kids, but they will end up paying when the lawsuits start rolling in from the unsafe conditions these kids have caused.",CoupLand
50,Greatest water rides. This is the original water park of so cal. You will love it and the area around the park.,"Great waters park, awesome place.the park has some of the most craziest water rides around. The chill out river is just the best.",RayManhattan
20,"Nasty, Nasty, Nasty","This place is disgusting. Not that it is the park's fault, but the people that frequent this place. They piss and crap in the water. They even had to evacuate some of the pools. The food is good and if you have a cabana it's nice. The only thing I can say is get there early and get out early before the pools get contaminated.",Corey K

40,Raging Good Fun at Raging Waters,"Me and my 11 year son visited RW during August, we really enjoyed it, there is a lot of rides to do lines weren't too bad but I think that was due to some sort of concert going on at the wave pool.Place was clean, food was ok for but a bit pricey, entrance fee was value for money, would certainly go again.",Jeff M
20,Great Water Park! Staff was not so helpful :(,"Visited Raging Waters this summer and the family and I had a great time. The reason I graded this a ""Poor"" rating was due to one staff member, who allowed a group to friends use the H2O fast pass line without a time watch. I observed how this group of four waited in line and the gentleman in charge of the h2O line allowed them in. Overall great water park!!",Byron C
30,Go somewhere else,"I tour around the U.S. every year for a few weeks with my family. Therefore we have visited loads of places both good and bad and although I wouldn't say RW is bad, I would say money could be better spent elsewhere. We went there for my twin daughters benefit and they did enjoy the rides but as I pay the entrance fees I have a different perspective. Firstly,even though we went on the day kids in the area returned to school,we still found it virtually impossible to get a lounger to relax on,and when my wife and I actually found two, they were broken! Believe me when I say these were not the only two broken loungers. RW should realise not everyone wants to go on the rides,some of us just want to relax while the kids have fun and if we are paying our entrance fee to sit down,the least they can do is provide enough loungers that are fit for purpose. Secondly,the prices for food and drink are very high and I would suggest you take food in a cooler and come out to eat, as nothing is allowed in the park. We tried to get a bag of chips in,didn't succeed,and although I told staff at the entrance I would return in a few minutes to get them to take back to my car-they trashed them. Finally,as the prices for RENTING a locker are $9 and $14 and parking is $15 I would say RW need to look at things. Try Soak City or Hurricane Harbour instead.",UTAHBLUE
50,Fun In The Sun,"Raging Waters is more fun than an amusement park. A bit high in price, but you will leave feeling like you got your money's worth. The most unique day at an 'amusement park' you can spend, in a bathing suit, with your heart racing as you rush through water filled rides, laughing and yelling at the top of your lungs. So much fun and I am over 40! Go with your kids, friends, just go. You wont regret a second and challenge yourself to conquer 'Drop Out' and feel alive again!",Jenae7
40,"Water, water, everywhere.......","Go during the week as weekends get crowded. Rides are cool and there are differing levels for all types of bravery levels. Keep in mind that there is water ....everywhere. You are literally standing in water 75% of the time...bathroom, concessions, ride lines.....don't look down.",kirk k
50,Really fun water park,Start your day when the park opens so you can get as many rides in before the crowds. There was tons of fun for everyone. About 1 hour w traffic from Santa Monica.,HarrisClan_10
40,"Awesome Day, Great Layout, But Bring Your Own Food","Was really impressed with this park. The layout is great. We were there on a weekday and was able to find plenty of tables and shady spots for mom to hangout. By this I mean, they have a huge covered balcony area with about 100 tables to sit and eat in the shade. On the park level there were also many small, covered picnic tables. HOWEVER, bring your own food. Paid $13 per person for the basic Carls Junior Burger, fries, drink. One kiddo had a $9 mini pizza that was mostly crust. For us this is uncomfortably pricey. They do have a nice picnic area for people to enjoy their own picnic lunch. If I remember right, years ago they had pizza by the slice for something like $3. Way better idea for them!!!!!The rides were thrilling for my thrill seekers despite the long lines. Everyone had a blast and we will return........... with our own lunch.",dprell
40,Had a blast!,"It had been years since we'd been to Raging Waters and we had a blast! Some tips:- They allow you to bring your own water in a soft-sided cooler (no other outside drinks or food or hard-sided coolers). You want to do this! Drinks are expensive in any theme park.- They don't check between towels so we put some crackers / protein bars in for snacks.- Get the standard Cabana ($100) if you an afford it! It was so peaceful and relaxing and buying it ahead of time on-line was the way to go. If you want to be by the little kids section you want the 60's (61, 62, etc) but if you want to be in a quieter area go for the 80's (81, 82, etc) by the Amazon River. The line later in the morning was so long and I'm sure some of those people walked away without!- If you get the Cabana you don't need the inside locker storage which helps save even more AND you get a free Raging Waters towel of your choice ($18.99 value).- The on-line combos is a good deal IF you want Carl's Jr (normal combo $11.99 - but purchasing on-line was $8.99) but you're extremely limited. The on-line combo is only good for some items at Sharkey's (chicken fingers combo), Pizza and Carl's Jr (hamburger combos only - doesn't work for the Green Burrito meals). If you want Pinks Hot Dogs or anything else just pay for it in the park. The food was decent - just expensive as in any theme park.- There is a family picnic area / outside locker storage so bring your own food to leave in the locker if you want to save $.- Bring $15 CASH ONLY for parking.- Plan to get there early! We arrived at 9:30 am and had no problem parking and waited at the gate to get in at 10:00 but there were LOTS of people there ready to get in as well.- It was a blast and the park was open 10:00 am - 7:00 pm and we stayed until just before 7:00 so plan on spending your entire day there to get your $ worth and just because you'll want to!",Karen C
50,The Disneyland of water parks (without the princesses),"Raging Waters is the perfect place to take the kids and cool off. It's fun for the whole family with slides of different levels (not scary, kind of scary, very scary).If you're looking for a cheap way to spend the day, do not come here. It's a theme park, which means admission is expensive, food and drinks are completely overpriced (nearly $10 for a slice of pizza and soda? Seriously?) but you're also paying for the experience of having fun.Also, if you're counting down the days until school starts, feel free to drop the kids off or let them wander the park to give you a much needed break. They willreturn tired.",SaraMS22
30,Might Be Time To Upgrade For a Better Experience,"Having recently visited Aquatica in the San Diego area (Chula Vista), I can compare experiences. Maybe it's because Raging Waters is popular and Aquatica brand new, but the crowds at Raging Waters and line management needs work. Waiting an average of 30 minutes in line while dripping wet is not conducive to a good experience. Yes, I know you can buy a fast pass-like experience for an additional fee, but it might be time for a serious upgrade.The parking lot gets crowded quickly, and the shuttles that take you back to the car and quite slow. Slow enough to the point where we walked back to the car. The food is okay, but paying $12 for a Carl's Junior burger combo is kind of silly. The rides are okay, but Raging Waters may want to take a page out of Aquatica's book and start upgrading. The lines to rent lockers is always quite long, and since we received season passes as gifts, we waited til the end of our visit to get them because the line for photos was at least an hour long.Overall, Raging Waters is fine for maybe one or two visits, but line management really needs to be worked on for it to become a place that would become more of an attraction than an inconvenience.",LeeTrotman
30,Better when all the rides are open!,"Staff seemed friendly and welcoming, although a few were a little incompetent but we were not warned that half the park was closed! It was clean but a little run down! We weren't completely satisfied but! When we voiced our disappointment to the staff they immediately refunded our money! Overall a pretty average morning, would be great if everything was open! Food was fairly over priced, but like all these things it always is!",OJCS
30,^^,"Nice rides. Would've enjoyed it more if we didn't have to wait 30minutes for each slide. Since it has been more than 2 years since I went there, I don't know if there are anything new.

40,Under-Rated.(thankfully!!),"I have heard bad things about Raging Waters since I mover to CA 6 years ago. I love water parks so I bought season passes last year and every time my girls and I went we loved it. never any problems at all. great rides and good times all day.

50,One of the BEST waterparks out there,I LOVE Raging waters. I have a blast every time I go. I can't get enough of the water slides. I haven't been for a while but I am planning to take my kids this coming summer to show them a wonderful time. Hopefully they will like it as much as I do.,Adonna M
20,Didn't meet our expectations,"My children 7 and 13 have been begging for a trip to Raging Waters for years, so we decided to go for my daughters birthday in August. We knew ahead of time that we'd have to pay $15 (cash) for parking so we were prepared. We purchased our admission tickets online in advance using coupon codes found online to get a discount and that process was painless. We paid for a locker as soon as we arrived and set out to ride our first water slide. After we'd been waiting in line for about 10 minutes we started to wonder what was going on, why the line wasn't moving, was something wrong? Maybe we should leave and come back later? Come to find out, the line for almost every ride (at least 95%) is about 45-90 minutes! In the heat and sometimes, the sun! Once we got to the front of the line, they required us to take off our water socks which I thought was kind of annoying since the whole reason I purchased water socks for the whole family is because they fit snugly and don't fall off. So now we are all attempting to hold our shoes while holding onto the handles of the tube, while riding the water ride. When lunch time rolled around we started checking out what kind of food the park had to offer. We were fully prepared to pay a pretty penny - it's an amusement park - that's just how it is. But we were so disgusted at the prices that we actually opted to eat ice cream and skip lunch all together. $15 for a Carl's Jr. burger, fries and drink is insane! Seating was hard to come by and seating in the shade was almost impossible but we managed eventually. All of the tables were dirty and covered with trash that no one apparently was willing to throw away. In fact, the entire park was trash filled which I found disconcerting. There were a lot of bees flying around the table areas. I kept telling my kids to ignore them but they were aggressive bees and ignoring wasn't possible, so we ate fast and left. I also noticed that the rides were operated by mostly teenagers. I get that. Great place to work during summer break. But they didn't seem to be all that friendly nor did many of them seem to be too knowledgable of how to organize the lines appropriately. When my daughter and I stood in line for what I thought was a ridiculous amount of time for a kiddie slide (at least 45 minutes) I realized that the operator wasn't appropriately breaking the people into two lines for the two different slides. Instead everyone was just kind of willy nilly jumping around, taking cuts and doing whatever they wanted. After my daughter stood at the front of the line for about 5 minutes, I finally chimed in and asked if she could get on the slide. The operator kind of shrugged me off and said 'ya'. Almost like I was stupid for even asking. We all decided that was our last trip and that Raging Waters wasn't worth all the hoopla. But we are NOT done with water parks all together. We will be trying Hurricane Harbor, Knotts Soak City and possibly others in the future.",Karla J
20,first visit,"Overall the park was fun but lacks seating around the attractions for those who are waiting for those on the rides. The parks staff ""all of them"" were very rude and not one ever smiled. Not sure if I'll ever go back???? The park is in need of a major make over. It's run down and dirty.",Rene W

50,Family fun,First time visit and the kids had a good time. Not to friendly for families with infants no pllace to sit. Don't forget your stroller because it is hard to find a place to settle down and watch the kids with a baby. Cabanas are expensive and not enough of them.,ccggonzalez
50,Great Family Fun!,"I took my 12 year old boys here for the first time and I can't believe how much fun they had! The rides vary from the daring to the tame and the park is a good size where it offers fun and not a day spent walking around more than enjoying the day. Lunch time usually means bad food at an outrageous price! But here, we found a place where one son had a chicken sandwich, another fried chicken (both with fries) and I had nachos, all very BIG portions at less than ten dollars a piece and tasty too! Get here early because parking is limited and the lockers that are close go fast, but other wise, get ready to get wet (don't forget the sunscreen) and have a great time!",childofcorn

Many areas are ""closed for repair"", it's too expensive, poor value ... an extra 1/2 hr takes you to Lake Gregory where for a fraction of the price you'll have a far superior experience.It looks like they haven't kept the place up adequately and there are years of visible deferred maintenance.",Shlomo B
10,What kind of Water Park is this?,"Bah! I am disgusted about this god awful place. Somewhere earlier this month, I've remembered the great times I had as a kid. Raging Waters is a fun experiance for me as a kid. One day when I went to Carl's Jr, I got a coupon for Raging Waters. Heck, before this month came, I've always dying to go to Raging Waters. On the day were my uncle and I went to the park itself, I got too excited to care about the long lines. Finally, we got a locker and we got ready for the rides. I knew I should've red the reviews first, but the lines to the rides were awful. My uncle kept saying, ""I'm bored."" but I kept having to tell him to be patience. As I went to the High Extreme Slide, the line was horrible and the mat I got had vandalism with the ""Nazi"" symbol on it. There's one water slide I do not recommand. I went on it and it jumps me up and down, hitting my back hard and water came splashing hard towards my eyes. That ride is too dangerous. Now, the food service is terrible. I wish I ate at home instead. My uncle and I asked for a refill for his soda and my water, but the guy said, ""We don't do that."" What a rip-off! Do not buy their food/drinks! Oh yeah, I've lost my sunglasses (Which means I had to buy a new one) and my clothes. Losing my clothes humiliated me more than my sunglasses. As I went to the bathroom to get ready to leave, the bathroom is disgusting. I felt like my feet are filthy because of the floor. After that, I've lost my uncle until my mom came and got us. As I attempt to reenter the park to find my uncle, the guard rudely yelled at me, ""You need to wait in line like everyone else!"" I was crying, angry, tired and thirsty. I felt like my childhood is a fake. My childhood visit is a disastor. The heat is really bad too. Do not go to this GOD AWFUL park! Go to Disneyland or Universal Studios or Knott's instead.",Goldvin G
40,Super fun if you plan well!!!,"First to the negative: 1) Can't bring in any food in to the park, 2) Lockers are quite pricey, 3) Food lines are long, 3) Ride lines can also be long. Now to the positive.... for large families I recommend you have a heavy breakfast and bring ice chests to leave food in your vehicle. We carried absolutely nothing other than water bottles and were already dressed to go into the park preventing any time wasted to change into swim suits in their unbelievably congested restrooms. Without any further delay we ventured out to explore the park and while half of our group enjoyed one ride the other half lined up for another ride.... cutting down waiting times. Favorite ride was the Black hole.... the Ragin' slide was also surprisingly rough. Truly enjoyed Thunder rapids and the Amazon River. We had tons of fun at Splash Island Adventure.... appropriate for all age levels. If you plan your time well and visit the park when they are open the longest amount of hours, you can easily go through every single attraction at least once!",luvmochi
50,Fun,This place is a blast! Our children went here every summer and the grandkids have gone there as well. Absolute fun for the whole family.,Ed and Margie C
10,"Trashy, missmanaged and chaotic!","This is the most awaful theme park/water park in existence. We are a family who loves theme and water parks. We have been to all of them in southern CA as well as in Florida. We used to go to WildRivers water park in the O.C. We loved that park. However, when they closed down this year, we decided to give Raging Waters a try. Foolishley, we bought the season as well as parking pass. Our first and last visit was horrible to say the least. The place is totally missmanged and run practicly by high schoolers. Lines are long, water is dirty, food lines are long(we had to stand in the Carls' Junior long for 45 minutes with only one line, no supervisors and no appologies for the long line. Every time I asked someone for help on services, rides etc, they didn't know. They said either it eas their first day or laughed it off since they didn't know.We bought the expensive Cabana. We never got service which was promised and our cabana didn't even have the napkins and cutelery that the expensive Cabanas were supposed to have.No offence but we thought we were in a third world country. So obviously we left early miserable with two very disappointed young kids. My 7 year old daughter kept saying she would never want to come back to this place and my son said how much he missed Wild Rivers. No matter, obviously we were not going to go back but I had bought the season pass. I had to go through several people and several phone calls to get to their Manager who said they would not issue any refunds. I was amazed by this. Ususally reputable theme parks have such confidence in themselves that they woul accomodate any such requestes. I kept persisting and complaining and finally he said that if we were willing to come back another day, he would give us a free cabana if I only told him a few days in advance. Reluctantly, that's what we did. Three days prior to a very hot sunday, I contacted the manager and told him we were thinking of coming that sunday. He emailed me that it was fine and included three other people on his email confirming that they would have a cabana reserved for us that Sunday. Surely enough we drove up to Raging Waters again, we had to park our car on dirt area, took a bus with no A/C to get to the entrance only to find out that they had no Cabana for us and that they were all sold out!! At first they claimed that they had not received the request. When I should them the email, they claimed that we had arrived late and they had given it away!!! At that point, we just decided to head back home instead of ruining another day at this horrible place. Naturally, I complained again tot the manager but he didn't care and didn't offer any appologies or remedies. We have been to Hurricane Harbor, Knotts Soak city in Buena Park and Legoland water park. Trust us, they are all better and more worth your money. Not only all these other parks are cleaner and safer but they are all professionally managed and kept.",Natalie u
40,Decent park,"Spent a day here just the other week, it's a decent sized park with a few rides, managed to get on most while having to wait on line for a while. Couple of breakdowns on the rides caused even longer waiting but on a whole it was a decent day.",Chris R
10,"Patience Required, $300 - 3 Hrs - 3 Rides","My wife and I brought 5 teenage boys for a birthday party on Saturday, 9:30AM.1) If you buy your tickets online be prepared to be treated like a criminal. You will be made to prove your identity to verify that you did not buy your tickets from a scalper. You will be sent to the customer service window and asked personal questions, TSA style. Once your integrity has been thoroughly vetted by a competent teenage clerk you will then be sent back to wait in line for admission...again...this is a primer for the waiting that will define your day at the park. Sure glad we got their early to beat the crowds. Ticket scalping is Raging Water's problem but they have devised a way to thrust the burden of managing loss prevention onto its lifeblood, its customers.2) The park opens at 10AM...sort of. Much of the park opens at 11AM. Surprise! What fun! Why does the park do this? I do not know. My guess is it has to do with the bottom line. What I can tell you is that it absolutely detracts from the guest experience.3) If you leave the attractions area and retreat to the parking lot for a picnic lunch as many people do, get your hand stamped prior to leaving. NOTE! To reenter the attractions area look for the signs CLEARLY marked ""Group"" or ""ADA"" (Americans with Disabilities Act). I guess a ""Park Reentry"" sign isn't in the budget. Oh, and you will have to....WAIT...to be granted reentry by the same employee who is attending to the Group and ADA entrance.4) Rarely have I ever been in an outdoor environment where there are so many people packed in that you cannot escape the smell of body odor...yes outdoors! Ah! Sales opportunity...an oxygen bar.The water slides are decent but if the park is busy you will only be able to slide about once per hour.

10,Worse water park we have been to,"We have gone to many different water parks. This one was the worse. Overcrowded, not enough bathroom facilities, employees who would not assist. We arrived within 15 minutes after the park opened but could not find a place to leave our things. Minimal shaded areas. People had taken over the tables at the food stands, stuff was spread out everywhere. So there was no place to sit and eat. We found 2 sets of restrooms, another one was closed. No more than 14 stalls for men and women. The floors in the bathrooms were filthy. No wonder the place smelled of urine. To go on any of the slides meant at least a 60 minute wait in line, much on unshaded concrete. By 1 pm trash was stacked up everywhere - the employees could not keep up. We bought the refillable drink cups, 20 minutes in line everytime to fill them. Some of the food stands that listed filling the cups did not but the employees working those stands let people stand in line waiting. At one point there was a crisis with security, life guards and EMT's with gear running through the park. These staff members did not know where to go - they didn't have radios. Turned out it was a false alarm thank goodness. Someone in the health department needs to check this place out. It can't possibly meet standards. My husband is handicapped. They have some blue lines to follow for wheelchairs etc but they don't lead to rides. Even the lazy river is not easily accessible. I don't believe it would meet ADA criteria either. The wave pool was so crowded that you were afraid of being hit by someone. Tubes were also limited. Even though I had to check the areas listed below (food service, bathrooms etc) all were woefully inadequate. Horrible day!!Management not visible, they were probably in the back rooms counting the money.",RoseCLV
10,No management or Customer Service,"OK, here it goes, we purchased our ticketas on-line to take the kids there on a wed. We checked the hours of operation before we arrived. It stated 10-7 for that day. When we entered the park we went to the aquatic section, which has all the fun rides and the employees stated that that part of the park opens at 11? I said what? It stated on-line that the park opens at 10 and it never stated that a portion (the best part of the park) opens at 11. So we say what the heck lets us go to the other side which had a few rides, so we waiting in line for Neptunes Fury... Guess what..The employee said that there was no employee on the bottom of the ride so we had to wait like 20 minutes to get somebody there so we can get on the ride. This place is run with young kids trying to do the best they can but there is NO management or organization at all...We made the best of it and the kids had fun on the rides. But now here is the kicker... They start closing the park around 5:45.. I found an employee and said what is going on, they stated the park closes at 6.... I asked if there was anyone in managment i can speak to and they told me to go to guest services... Once i get there i am greated by a high school kid saying there is no managers there, then i ask if i can get a phone number for corporate or a manager and she said she does not know the number..... Really i am suprised they still operate with such lousy customer service... I guess the heat and the need to cool off causes people to keep going back to this place.....",Kristen M
40,Raging Fun,"Great for kids of all ages! Rent a standard cabana and have food delivered to your cabana (be prepared, the food is very pricey). The cabana is great if you have grandparents in your group. Summer 2012 they are making accomodations for the disabled (finally) so some areas were blocked off but all the slides and attractions were open. Downside: The park opens at 10am but you can't get into the water until all lifeguards are at their posts. They are due at their posts at 10:30 but we couldn't get into the Amazon until almost 11am because the lifeguards were late. Go during the week and get there early to avoid parking in the dirt lot. Have a Raging Day!",Leni28
40,Everyone loves a waterpark,It seems like it anyway because it seemed that everyone was there. Still there is a lot to do and it was clean.,Snoopydance
20,Wouldn't go again,"Old and kinda run down. Seems like they let too many people in at a time. We were there on Saturday and had to wait a least 40 min. for each ride. Rides were all enclosed and pitch black, which we didn't care for. Parking was poor. Just seems like an older park and wouldn't visit again.",family_2go702
40,Fun but the lines are long,Raging waters is really fun but the lines are like an hour and a half drop out is so fun it's the tallest slide but there was a lot of gum on the trees but the slides were fun and short and the bathrooms were pretty disgusting but overall raging waters is really fun!,Aubs12
40,"Good, but a few improvements could make it great!","Went to Raging Waters, San Dimas, for the 1st time in a few yrs. The park has excellent slides, fun stuff for the little ones, and a good wave pool. A few bad things: other reviewers have talked about how badly the restrooms are kept. It's true, they're nasty. They need a complete overhaul and probably an attendant inside of them to keep people from trashing them. There are not enough lounge chairs. If you're not on line when the park opens, it's hard to find a good spot to set up a family area. Lines are very long. They might consider using a ""fast pass"" type of system like @ Disney. Like all parks, food, drinks, and store items are expensive. It's a very good waterpark, but with a few improvements, it could be a great one.",Cal-Fan07030
30,Okay to go for a little fun.,The food there is really expensive. It's better to bring food from home. There are long lines to get on a 10sec ride. Go if you never gone before but don't go back often.,Yzabelle A
10,Totaly disgusting!,"My son and his friend went in July 2012. Not only was the price of admission totally absurd, the price of the food was outrageous. While in the water park, my son's friend ended up stepping in human feces that was near the river. Other's noticed and the park clean up crew decied to just put a chair over the feces instead of cleaning it up. Later my son got a severe bloody nose and no park personel came to his aide. His friend had to run to the disgusting bathroom to get paper towels. Not one single lifeguard nor other park personel came to his aide. Do not go to this place, head to some other water park!",LILLYCALIFORNIA
20,too many people,just too many people here..... it could have been better with less rude people.(not staff) it was fairly clean. i would maybe try again when crowds are less. the slides we did go down were pretty fun.,hugh b
40,Can be great fun,"Don't show up in the afternoon- it gets crowded. Get there at opening and stake out lounge chairs. If you want to do the big slides, do a few right away before the lines get too long. Then when the big crowds get there you can just lie in the sun or ride an inner tube along the Amazon Adventure. Get there early enough and it can be great fun. The food is overpriced so we usually have a good breakfast before we arrive and just get a snack while we're there. Raging Waters is not spectacular; you won't find Disneyland-level service, but still, it's run fairly well. And it's a great place to cool off- especially with a season pass when you don't feel like you have to wait in every line.",Zach P
50,Family Fun Town..who's in,"I love this place and when I think about how happy I was when I went for my 10th birthday, I had to make sure to take my little cousins. They had a blast in the wave pool, and zipping down the slides.",MarketingDiva
40,Resident of Southern California - We Love Raging Waters,"I been taking my kids to Raging Waters since it was built and I went there before it was Raging Waters. I read the reviews and I must say Yes the bathrooms can use some cleaning and yes you might run into some hoodlums and rude people. But I see it at Disneyland, Knotts and just about any amusement park we attend. You just learn to speak up and call someone if you need assistance. I love taking my kids there and there are ways of not spending hardly any money. Arrive early and you can park out front , bring an Ice Chest and you can go out and eat in the PicNic Area and have drinks and snacks. I always bring in water bottles never had a problem or never had them taken away. I also bring in small snacks like crackers or chips. Also always check out the coupons at the Markets they have great offers so do the Credit Unions. Always bring folding chairs and umbrella they have sandy beaches where you can put them up and Ive never had anyone take anything and I always leave everthing under my chair. The babies love it the Toddlers love it and mommies can play with the babies all day. Now that my kids are grown I enjoy the river with them we float around and take in some sun very relaxing and will always return.",Linda M
30,Ehh...,"It was alright, its very crowded and expensive. Its not too fun since it is kind of gross, because all the little kids pee in the water, and there are a lot of long lines which also gets annoying since there is not too many attractions there, but it is still pretty fun! I might not go back, just because my family did not like it that much, but it is still fun to try out, its different than other places.",Paragandson
50,Amazing family park,I love this water park. The park was bigger than most other water parks around. My family had so much fun. There was something for everybody wade pools for the kids and fast slides for the adults. My 3 yr old daughter wandered off and lifeguards had her stand by them until I found her which was so nice that they are family friendly and actually care about their patrons. Tickets were semi expensive $37 for adults and children under 48 inches were $25 under but the season pass was only $20 more so it paid for itself in 2 visits and you can buy a season parking pass for $50 and that pays for itself within 3 visits since parking is normally $15. My family had a blast and we can't wait to go this year. My now 4 yr old won't stop asking when she can go back to the water slides.,Liambeum
40,HUGE and fun!,Great water park! Only thing to note it that it is built on hilly terrain so you walk UP a lot after you have slid 'down'... big and fun it is the original water park in the area!,Carlo D

30,Basic,Old and doesn't seem too clean. Dont like the place.,Havenu
40,A Must For All Waterpark Enthusiasts,"Unlike most waterparks in Southern California, Raging Waters had the space to build a big waterpark, and they did. There really is something for everyone at this park. There are big slides for big kids, medium slides for medium kids, and a small water area for your small kids. Also, because Raging Waters is so big, if a line is too long for one slide, just move on to the next one where the line is not so long. If you are visiting Southern California and have the chance to visit just one waterpark, Raging Waters is head and shoulders above the rest of the waterparks in Southern California.",CoupLand
50,So much fun,"Took my daughter there last year and went with friends several times in the past. It's family friendly, Nearby, and Not overpriced like other major parks",Andrew P
40,Great place to spend the day with the kids,"Take sunscreen, it'll be a long day. Helps to get there early so you can get a comfortable spot. It's a nice place and the kids are sure to have fun on a hot summer day.",Where2GoWhere2go
30,Fun,"Great for a day with the family,wet great rides for all ages,gets crowded in the summer time. Bring sunscreen you will need it,not much areas with shade.",JeanetteS532
30,ok,Good for being in my local area and to spend time with other moms.,SYN D
30,Wheeeeee!,"What a ball! Speedy rides that will tear your bathing suit off, lazy river is fun but the best is the wave pool. Usually very crowded and you have to wait in the sun while going up the stairs for another run . Can't bring in your own food. Locker rental available for purses, etc.",KarenH92807
10,THE WORST MANAGEMENT AND CUSTOMER SERVICE,"DO NOT USE THEIR ONLINE SALES - I purchased a ticket for my daughter. I received an immediate payment confirmation stating with big, bold, red letters: THIS IS NOT A TICKET. It also stated that an email would be sent to me shortly with an attachment to print the ticket. As of today, I have not received it (1 week) yet they refuse to help or issue a refund and to top it off their staff especially their so called ""Receptionist"" VANESSA kept interrupting me to scream on my ear that I could've printed the confirmation and give it to my daughter to get in the park. Seriously? She was going on a field trip! Was i going to run the risk that she would not been admitted into the park?On another sour note, the group ended up leaving early due to unruly teens and drunk adults who had sneaked alcohol into the park. Food was overprices, trashcans where overflowing, and the bathrooms where filthy. OVERALL? Skip it. Go to Disneyland or to any of our free beaches.",Martha M
40,teenagers love it !!,"you have to get to park early and be willing to spent a few bucks extra because there is an upper and lower parking, and park entrance is located at upper parking lot. if you get the lower you'll have to wait for a tram to and from.park has lots for shaded areas for the non swimmers. Cabanas are overrated and every expensive ..so not worth it. Lines are very long so be willing to wait to ride. i would also recommend swimming shoes. its a great family trip things for all ages to do. make a full day trip out of it",evahtc
10,"Worst Management, Let the thief walk back and refused to take our complaints..","This guy tried to run away with my valet in the amazon river adventures... 3 of our friends, rounded him up and pleaded the lifeguards there to call the securities.. after all our yells and blackmails, they agreed to bring the securities.. all the while, we were running behind the thief! When we started mentioning cops, he threw my purse over a tree n ran off.. And the securities were mad coz we tried to climb their property to pick my valet.. we got the thief down, took him to securities, the manager Nick declared "" He did not steal, he found the purse and he REUTRNED it to you. This is not robbery"" they let him walk out and refused to take our complaints, and said "" If u want to file a complaint, u can go to sheriff station, we are not cops, we cannot do much"".. The thief thrusted his tongue out, mocked at us and walked away, right in front of the Park Manager Nick.. I cant believe they really run a park like this in California, USA.. Mis behaviours are ignored and they did not even issue a warning.. worst security in place, coz they dont want their park name to be in papers..",Priya_Rajamani
10,"OMG, what has happened?","I hadn't been to Raging Waters in well over ten years (not sure why), but I decided to take my ten year old son for a mid-week treat, right after school let out for the summer. We got there quite early and were able to park in the lower lot. I think if we had gotten there two seconds later, we would have had to take the tram from some far off remote parking area. Hint: Get there at least 30-minutes before it opens.I am so sad to report that this place has taken a turn for the worse. The lines were extremely long, and we were there on a Wednesday morning. I need to be careful about what I say here, because I don't want to offend anyone.... it was wall to wall hispanic gang members. I mean, it was really, really bad. I'm not a sociologist, but I think they were all trying to ""out bad"" each other. Maybe it's a gang thing? I don't know, but it would be funny to watch were it not such a dangerous place to be. This was going on all over the park, and it wasn't just the adults. The teenagers and even the pre-teenagers were just awful. Rude, vulgar, and showing a complete disrespect toward anyone and everyone. It was not a safe enviornment, despite the security guards.Don't even get me started on the bathrooms.I honestly wish it was not like this, but it is what it is.*sigh*",IanWSmith
10,too croweded not for descent families,"i went to raging waters with my one year old and my teenagers to enjoy. i remember when i use to go back in the 80'swith my friend. so i decided to introduce my childern to the park to share some of my experiences and fun. But to my suprise it was horrible! the park was dirty and filled with mexicans!!! We could not enjoy the park at all due to the ignorance and rowdiness of the crowd!! kids were running wild everywhere ,the kids were using vulgar language and the parents didnt care! My one year old and i were run over a couple of times in the kids pool thanks to the hoodlums that ran wild splashing water and showing no respect!! it was dirty,the bathrooms were dirty ,the people seemed to not realize when using the bathroom after a bowell movement ""the toilet paper goes into the toilet!!!!"" but of course they put it on the floor acting as if they didnt realize they were in a public place and not at home!!! It was a terrible experience for me and my family. my childern wanted to leave and we did exactly that!! never to return to this hell hole again!!!",chrissyReseda

30,Probably wouldn't go again,"Average price for adults and children. Lots of teenagers. Not many choices for food. Had to pay $10 to store a cooler, prior to entering the park. No food/snacks are allowed into the park. Only water. Also had to pay $15 for parking. Some of the rides needed upkeep. Friendly staff/lifeguards though.",wicked51
20,Not what we thought,"We spent $100 to get our family in and the lines were slow and things in the kids area were broken and not working.This is the deal...they only create shade for about 10% of thier visitors. When the 10% is filled (and gets filled even on the slowest day) you are required to spend $80 on a shade bungalo, half are hard built and the other half are nothing but awnings with screens. If you have a medical problem which requires you to not be that much in the sun, well their answer is that they may not accomodate you unless you cough up the $80. They do not let you bring in any kind of food or drink, not even water. So you either cough up the $3 per small bottle or catch one outside in the parking lot or in the ambulance after you collapse in the long hot lines. The appear to have a killer be hive not far from the park as a few people were stung there and were constantly harrased by bees buzzing our head or trying to land on us. Half the staff would not even smile. People whom don't have kids would take the shade spots in the kids area and dissapear for the day. After a couple hours there my wife was ready to cry. It seemed like a big waste! We lost our 7 year old daughter and then found her in a half hour, I couldn't imagine loosing her if it was actually a busy day. We tried to order a regular pizza and 4 drinks (the pizza looked horrible) this came up to $45 so we refused and ate later. The staff allow anybody in the park to be rude, pushy and almost to the point of violence (which a security officer was talking to 2 guys whom already got to that point when we got there) My wife almost got hit with chairs someone didn't want next to the loungers becuase someone arrived and felt the need. Compared to this place, disneyland is a deal!If we ever do go back, it will be much different and on even a slower day with our cooler packed for a picknick in the parking lot. We won't bend to thier greed, especially if they won't fix the attractions.",The_Fam_Montclair
10,Save your money! Go to another water park!,"Last year we bought passes to Raging Waters, San Dimas, CA. It was the first time we had even been there. Last year they offered premium parking which meant no matter what time you got there, you got to park in the lower parking area and didn't have to use the tram. This year they don't have that. We have been 3 times this year and no matter what time we get there (early or late), we have had to park in one of the outer parking lots and take the tram in. This means you can't just run out to your car and eat lunch. The tram adds on another 15 to 30 minutes to how long it takes to get into the park. I was so angry when we got there at 10am and had to take the shuttle and half the lower parking area was empty. When I complained, I was told it was being reserved for management and handicapped parking. However, they have two full rows of marked handicapped parking, so that doesn't make sense to me. And why can't management park in the outer lots and take the tram in? Why do they inconvenience their paying customers?Next year we will not be purchasing season passes. Besides the parking situation, I think the park has definitely gone downhill between last year and this year. This year the customer service is even worse. The bathrooms are filthy. There is trash all over the park which looks like it's been there for a while. When we went in July (2010) I couldn't believe how much trash was in the water in front of Neptune's Fury. It was gross. The seating area around the Amazon River is disgusting. Seeds, etc. that have fallen off the trees are never swept up which means that it sits in huge piles, so your feet are always filthy. And it makes the Amazon River dirty also. Even on peak days, they are running short-staffed. Rides like Thunder Rapids and Neptune's Fury which usually have 2 lifeguards running them now only have one, so the lines are even longer than they usually are which is quite long. And when the park isn't at peak capacity, it feels like it is, because they don't have enough people working the rides.I have been to Hurrican Harbor in Maryland, so I know that a water park can be kept clean. Raging Waters needs to be visited by the Health Department. The bathrooms are not fit for human beings and that's first thing in the morning.Save your money. Go to another water park!",diamondgirl125
30,Don't do it. Visited the park for my...,"Don't do it. Visited the park for my daughter's 7th birthday. First time I have ever visited this park. The parking lot attendant was talking smack about the bus in front of us. That was professional! What should have been my first clue that I had made a mistake was when i noticed a lot of police around the parking lot areas. Once inside the park I thought I had stepped into a prison yard. Gangsters walking around with their shirts off showing all their gang tattoos. The one good thing I noticed that they had a lot of security roaming around keeping the hoodlums in check. When the park closed there was a very very long line to get on the tram. We did have some entertainment in the parking lot. The police were arresting a guy in the parking lot. Of course the caliber of people in the line in front of me thought it was ""scandalous"" that the police were arresting someone for doing something wrong. Stay away is my recommendation.",hppygilmore
20,The worst trip to a waterpark I've ever had..,"Went to Raging Waters for my first time yesterday (Sunday, July 25th). It was the worst waterpark I've ever been to, all the lines were an hour wait or longer, the food line did not move for 30 minutes, took us an hour and a half to get the the front when there was only about 15-20 people in line in front of us. The workers are so slow at the food counter I couldn't believe it.We went on 5 rides the whole time we were there from 12pm to 7:30pm. The rides are fun, but probably the same as any other waterpark, but I'll never go to Raging Waters again. Next time either Hurricane Harbor, Wild Rivers, or Soak City.. Maybe if you go on a week day it's not so bad but it was worse lines I've ever seen at any theme park or waterpark, and I live in Socal so I've been to a lot. Definitely would not recommend going here on weekends.",soCalbrunette
10,Don't do it. You will regret coming to this park.,"Don't waste your time or money going to this park. There are at least a half dozen water parks in the southern California area. For the love of all that is holy, go to Hurricane Harbor, it's cheaper, bigger, better maintained, better organized, and has at least semi-decent customer service. If this is your closest water park, all the other ones are worth the drive to avoid this place. Here's my horrible day at Raging Waters:I have never had a worse experience with anything that was supposed to be fun. The park is miniscule compared to any other water park I've ever been to, including one in Oklahoma, but they've expanded the parking lot 5 times larger than its initial appropriate capacity, so the place is packed even on a slow day. The parking attendants are also horrible because they allow pedestrians to walk in front of the cars waiting to park for up to ten minutes without letting a single car park, which is a pretty big deal when the line stretches onto the highway. Once we finally did park it took half an hour to get into the water park because it's so far away from the lots. Once we got to the lockers there was no sign or staff member around to tell you that you have to get the locker keys at a separate kiosk that is nowhere in sight of the actual lockers. The instructions in the lockers themselves make it clear that they used to have the key already in them, like at Six Flags, but there's no indication that those instructions aren't relevant anymore. We waited in line for a ride for ten minutes with no indication of the line moving any time soon. Then the vending machine ate our money and when we went to guest services to see if we could get the money back they wanted us to wait for a third party company person to get there and deal with us. By this time we had been at the park for a couple hours without even getting wet because we couldn't find the one ride we really wanted to go on because the map of the park doesn't look anything like the park and doesn't even have half the visible rides on it, or a ""you are here"" spot. And to top it all off, I dropped my school ID at the park and when I realized it after I left and tried to call the park and ask if they found it, it was literally impossible to get in contact with an actual person instead of an automated machine or answering machine.",hisserbee
40,best california water park,I have been to 4 of the So. Calif water parks.Raging waters is by far my favorite. Funnest rides. Safest slides. I have never had a problem with the bathrooms being dirty. I have been going to this park every year for the past 10 years. The food is expensive and the lines can be long. But you can pack a lunch. There is a picnic area outside the park. And the lines are more bearable if you go on a tues/wed.,twinkledawnn
40,Have fun and relax!,"We went to Raging waters for the first time with a group of friends and family. We bought our tickets online for $35 each person. When we arrived there, the parking costs $15. NOTE: Carpool if you're in a group of people so you save with the parking. The water park wasn't big as I thought it would be like Wet n' Wild, but it was perfect. We went on a Monday, so it wouldn't be busy. The park hours was from 10 am-5 pm. I rented a large locker for $15, but when you return the key in the end..You have the option to receive $5 back or a cotton candy. In my case, I wanted my $5 back. We made all our money's worth by riding all the rides and the best ones, we got to ride again. It was a fun experience! I recommend going on the High Extreme slide, Thunder Rapids, Drop Out, Raging Racer with friends, and the Neptune. There was a new ride under construction, so we didn't get to experience the Tunnel of Terror. If you have a waterproof camera, you should definitely bring it. I brought mine and took a video going down on the slides...The staff wasn't strict and was okay with it. I had a great experience at Raging Waters for the first time. I've heard bad reviews about it, but for only $35.. I had no complaints to say about it. The only cons about the park, is that there was only one shower working in the Women's locker room and no covers. I was from out of town, so we were going back home after Raging Waters...I felt sticky with the sunblock and dirty because there was only one shower available. Overall, it was still a great park!",mscheng
40,FUN & REFRESING GREAT PLACE FOR ADULTS & KIDS,"After reading some of the negative reviews I was a little bit nervous about going to Raging Waters, but am so glad I went. It was my son’s B-Day so we decided to go anyway & we had such a great time!! We went on Sun. June 13th 2010, we got there early thinking there was going to be a crowd, but we were one of the 1st to be in line and parked right in front of the gate. Inside of the park was VERY clean including the bathrooms,( except once when a toilet was clogged, but found a supervisor & they took care of it right away) the staff was friendly and best of all there were no lines at all, until about midday but still the wait was about 5 to 10 minutes . I guess because we went early in the season that we were fortunate to practically have the park to ourselves. There lawn chairs that you could use for FREE, but its 1st come. Did not use the lockers we just carried our stuff & left them by our lawn chairs…nothing went missing. We did not buy food VERY EXPENSIVE, but did go outside of the park & ate our home food, they have a sitting area. Overall the rides were GREAT, they have something for everyone, had no problems, but I would not go during the busy season.",vacationfamily05
10,Can't believe this waterpark was rated one of the top in the USA,"Raging Waters was very dirty, had extremely expensive entrance fees, expensive and poor quality food, untrained personnel, and was a HUGE disappointment. We expected much better since it was highly rated by the Travel Channel. It started out with a 45 minute wait in line from the freeway exit just to get to the entrance gate. Unexplainably stupid, there were only a few ticket booths open so it took a long time standing in line just to purchase tickets. The changing rooms and toilets had not been cleaned from the previous day, only one shower in the womens' area was working, and most stalls did not even have toilet paper. There was lots of disgusting stuff on the floor floating in all the water, too. The drinking fountains also did not work. It took standing in line at least 30 minutes to one hour just to get a small drink for $2.99! Each ride required about an hour queue and some would not allow a single rider. Since I was with two children, I was not allowed to go on those rides because I could not locate a single rider to go with me. Just that fact alone begs the question ""why don't they have a single rider line for those rides?""The rides were fun and the kids did have a good time, although they were only able to go on a few due to the long lines.Another distressing thought is that since the cleanliness appeared to be like being in Mexico, how clean do they keep the water? I would highly recommend that people go to Disneyland or Disneyworld Water parks instead.",chriskaia
10,Some bad things about Raging Waters in San Dimas CA,"It seems like a nice place but here are some things wrong with it:- They do not heat the water in anyway anywhere. I went in 90 degree weather and was diving into 60 degree ice cold water. That really sucks. I had more fun in Slovakian water parks that heat their water...- Food is expensive and if you like to eat in peace... forget it.. not only do they lack good eating areas, you are constantly surrounded by a swarm of bees that want your food. It does not matter where you are in the park. If you have food in your hand, they will come. They currently do nothing to contain the massive bee problem.- 10 foot line for pizza can take up to 1.5 hours. They lack man and machine power to feed the place that is usually overcrowded on weekends.- They oversell tickets so the wait for any ride on the weekend goes something over 1.5 hours. That really sucks.- The 12 dollar locker you rent is so damn small it's ridiculous. Avoid the purple section. (to be fair they give you $5 back if you return the key)- Experience on this one may vary but when i was there with the massive crowd, they shut down 1/3 of the park.. I couldn't get anyone to tell me why...Should you go to this park? I say hell no!",dude50005000
10,Disgusting,"My wife and I decided to take our 3, and 4 year old to raging waters on this past Saturday. It seemed like a good idea at the time, but as soon as I arrived I knew we had made a bad decision. I knew from the moment we stepped out of our car, that this was not a good day to come. At first glance I thought that Raing Waters was doing some sort of gang member outreach day.Besided a lot of the people being dirty and looking like they had just been released from the local prision, the place was totally disgusting. There was trash all over the park, trash cans over flowing, and the bathrooms, well words cannot even describe how dirty they were. I had to tell my kids not to touch a thing in them. When I mentioned to one of the workers how dirty the restrooms were, she might as well have just blew me off.I know that it is hard to keep places clean, especially when some of the visitors are pigs! however with that being said, is it that hard for Raging Waters to fork out a little extra money and hire a few extra custodians?Also during our visit Raging Waters had to close the entire kids section, because someone had a bowel movement in the pool, so that just enhanced our experience even better. Also I was very frustrated with some of the lack of parental supervision that some of the young kids had. I saw many kids pushing and shoving, and cutting in lines, and the parents were nowhere to be found. If I was some sort of freak or child molester, I could have easily walked off with atleast a dozen kids, and the parents would have had no idea until they were ready to leave. I am now totally convinced that some people should not be allowed to reproduce.Well that is my impression of Raging Waters on my last visit. I went there in the 80s when I was younger, but what a change for the worse this place has taken. I will not be visiting Raging Waters again. I will be checking other local water parks around the area, and looking for a clean one, or atleast somewhere that makes an attempt to clean it up.Thanks Raging Waters for the awful experience that you gave my family and I this past weekend!!",Bodie70
10,Horrible Water Park,"Cons:- Crowded-There were many visitors there who behaved very rudely; for instance, there was a black man who wanted to fight me and I had done nothing to invoke his reaction. Not to mention there were so many people with tattoos and negative attitudes- Horrible food- Dirty bathrooms, lack of toiletries- Long lines with hour + long waiting times- The wave cove and the lazy river didn't have enough donut tubes to accommodate its occupants- A disgusting experience overall",manchester_alive
10,We had a terrible experience,"We were visiting the West Coast for a few days and decided to try out this water park. Every aspect of it was awful. We couldn't believe how dirty it was! The bathrooms were especially disgusting - mold and mildew everywhere. One stall overflowed and the staff didn't even close the restroom while they attempted to clean it. When we realized we were standing in waste I almost got sick. The eating areas were filthy as well. Tables stood for the longest time with half eaten sandwiches, spilled soda etc. on them. Bees were having a feast. They were all over the dirty tables and the guests. My husband waited 40 minutes on line for food. My fruit salad was moldy.The rides were fun, but the lines were long - about an hour each.Do not waste your time on this water park. It is just terrible.",Kenilworth38
20,Extremely disappointed with Raging Waters,"Okay, so i haven't been there since i was a kid in the late 80's and completely understand that places and things change, especially now that i'm considered a minority in my own state of California. I had very low expectations going on a crowded summer Sunday morning because a few friends that went recently gave me a warning of the kind of crowd we'd be sharing the water park with. They were right in that the crowd was different.My sole intention on going is so my 2 1/2 year old son could enjoy himself on a hot summer day. I'm usually one to find positive in most negative situations and unfortuantely, in this instance, I can only express one: Raging Waters offers a nice lagoon for toddlers and my little one was thoroughly entertained.We arrived at the park @9:45 and purchased a cabana just in time as we received the very last one. If we had arrived just a few minutes later, we would have had lounge chairs in the sun-oh what fun that would've been! By the way, the cabanas to rent for the day are $100. Pretty shocking, but extremely necessary, expecially with a pregnant me and a little fair skinned toddler.The park should let you bring food and water. I understand why they don't. Businesses need to make profit and the reason they charge you $9 for a slice of pizza is so they stay in operation. They told my husband they don't sell water until noon. We were hot and thirsty by 10:30am. I thought they were insane, and of course, i immediately complained and had a bottled water to my son by 11am. Some food was available before noon, but of course what we wanted didn't sell until after 12pm. Needless to say the line for our food was ridiculous and I don't think we ate until after 1pm. Everyone else in the park had the same craving for pizza.It's unfortunate the negative heavily outweighed and obviously I will never return to Raging Waters. .",CAmommaluvs2travel
20,Raging Dirty Waters,"Me & my 5 year old daughter just visited this park on the last day of their season (9/21). The waters had tons of tree trash in them & no one seemed to mind it. I know it's a water park in the mountain areas but I think the waters could be a bit more maintained. There are only 2 small gift shops that do not offer much choices for purchasing nice souvenirs. The staff does not seem to be interested in the safety of the kids. There was a toddler area for only toddlers, but the lifeguard on watch was allowing bigger kids to run & crowd the area. The sand ""beach area"" had tiny painful rocks instead of plain sand that ran off into the water area which made it again , dirty. Last year I went to Soak City for the 1st time & though I would try a different park, but the overall feeling of Raging Waters in San Dimas felt dirty. The dressing rooms did not have doors either. I most likely will not return to this park.",alestar
10,Disgusted On How I Was Treated,"I felt that some people were nice and helpful such as the ones up front. I however, when I lost my son for an hour, and I asked around, the life guards and security guards were asking what his age was and said it was only an hour. Try being a worried mom for ""only an hour with a missing child!"". Another life guard said that there are too many people to look for as I let them know where my son was.I finally found my son without the help from these comments from these life guards and security personel.Then when the park closed, I was going in the bathroom and this worker named Shanel was screeming at me and followed me to the toilet that the bathroom was closed and I had to get out. I had to go to the bathroom really bad and said that it is better for me to go in here then outside. She called security because I went in to go. I said that she was not yelling at the women who were brushing their hair. I think that going to the bathroom was more important then brushing their hair. Anyway, I commented that I have a weak blatter and yet she had sequrity waiting for me outside. I am so humiliated!! I am sorry, I paid $200 and if the bathroom is opened with women brushing their hair, I have the right to go to the bathroom !!!",DiscoStu69
10,"Boring, Dirty, anything but Raging","We just returned from raging waters a few hours ago, and are so disappointed I jumped on here to warn others from making our mistake. We are from the Midwest and recently moved to southern California. Needless to say we know water parks, Noah's Ark was a day trip away. After hearing Raging Waters was the BIGGEST water park in southern California, we thought ""How could we go wrong!"". Well, the answer is.... in every way imaginable.This park is TINY compared to any reputable water park throughout the U.S., especially those in the Midwest and Texas. We went on a weekday as to avoid the crowds mentioned in other reviews. It is true that there were not enough people to make it crowded, but most rides still didn't have enough tubes or rafts for the few people there. The waits weren't too bad, many under 20 minutes, but they could have been a lot less had there been enough rafts and had the staff been more dedicated. A lot of the staff really didn't care to be there and were putting people through at a snail's pace.The rides themselves were ridiculous. We are both in our twenties and were overwhelmingly bored with everything we went on. We went on all of the bigger slides and were not impressed. Maybe this would be a decent park if you are under the age of 12.The wave pool is the biggest joke there, there are no waves, it is not remotely comparable to a real wave pool like Disney's Typhoon Lagoon in Florida. There are only slight swells every 7 minutes that go side ways in the pool.The lazy river is more like an over-crowed bacteria festering lazy-creek, it goes in a tiny little circle that takes about 3-5 minutes to go around.You will be charged for everything, from parking, to lockers, to shade.The park itself was pretty disgusting, we arrived first thing in the morning, before the park opened, I was one of the first in the bathroom, and you could tell it had not been cleaned since the day before. The waste bins were overflowing with refuse and reeked of the unmentionable.Many of the people there were a little bit shady, I would not feel safe leaving my belongings, or my kids, alone. The food was overpriced and looked inedible, they do allow you to re-enter so you could go to your car and eat.I really can't say anything positive, except I positively will never go there again. All in all we went on most of the rides within 3 hours and couldn't wait to get out of there. I can't imagine how frustrated I would be if it were as crowded as people say it gets, and I had to wait for an hour for some boring slide.You have been warned...... save your money, take a real vacation and go to anywhere in Wisconsin Dells like Noah's Ark, Schlitterbahn in Texas, Wet N Wild in Florida..... or anywhere but here!",humbletravelerxx
40,Slowly making our way through the area attractions....,"Since moving to SoCal (Santa Monica) a year ago we have been visiting slowly the attractions that the area has to offer. Today we spent the entire day at Raging Waters in San Dimas - 30 miles from Los Angeles. Let me begin this review by saying there were some positive aspects to the visit and that we really enjoyed our day at the park. We arrived around 9:30 for a 10:00 o'clock opening. We paid the lower price for parking, $10.00 instead of $15.00 for preferred parking, but were able to park only steps from the front gate and did not require a shuttle to get around the parking lot. We were approximately 8th in line at 9:30. Not bad when we had read in other reviews on this site that we needed to be there HOURS before the gates opened in order to secure a good place in line. Granted, we were visiting rather late in the season - although the weather is hot and perfect as it always is in Southern California - so it does not feel as if it is late in the season. (However by 9:50 a.m. there were approximately 100 - 150 people in line behind us.) We were the first in line to get a locker key ($11.00 for a small locker - large enough for two - $5.00 of which is refunded at the end of the day when you return the key - so the locker costs $6.00. Not an inconsequential sum for a locker rental to my way of thinking!) We hit some of the bigger rides first i.e. High Extreme, Speed Slides, The Vortex and Bermuda Triangle. These were all great slides and very effective - you could feel their effect - each in their own way. But it might have been a better idea to start on the other side of the park with Neptune's Fury, Dragon's Den, Dark Hole and Ragin' Racer and Thunder Rapids. These slides were not as great to our way of thinking and we only did each of those slides once - whereas we went on the slides on the other side of the park - the side we originally visited - over and over again - despite the longer afternoon lines. You will certainly have your own taste in Water Slides - we simply preferred the slides to the left as you enter the main gate. Okay, on to bathrooms, here we must note that the bathrooms were especially dirty - as other have mentioned - and I am surprised that they are allowed to become so completely disgusting. It is a simple thing to clean bathrooms throughout the entire day! Just do it! In all the bathrooms EVERYTHING IS WET. Now I can understand the floors being wet - it is a water park - but every surface is wet - like a Dane Cook joke. It is disgusting and the reason I cannot give the park a full five stars. On to food. We had two meals in the park. After reading the other reviews I thought we would have a very difficult time finding food we could stomach all the while being rooked by the very exorbitant prices. So we were surprised to find that while the fare is not at all carb-conscious or especially healthful (again, it IS a waterpark folks!) we found some pretty good food. For lunch we looked at the options: hot dogs, hamburgers, cheeseburgers, corn dogs, chicken tenders, caesar salad, pizza and finally chose chicken sandwiches. They were served with A LOT of french fries that were actually pretty tasty. Well-fried and well-seasoned with a bit of Lawry's-like seasoning to make them more interesting. So many french fries came with the ""meal deal"" that I would NOT purchase their ""large-fries-for-only-one-dollar- more"" offer if I were you. That would just be silly! The chicken sandwich was char-broiled and also not bad at all - if a bit rubbery - but it was juicy enough and quite a nice meal. the sandwich was served with lettuce and tomato. Drinks are NOT included in the ""meal deal"" so that can run a bit more if everyone has a separate drink. We paid $21.00 for lunch for two chicken sandwiches that included fries and one (quite) large raspberry iced tea from the fountain. Pricey, yes, but we did not feel as if they had taken advantage of us. We spent the afternoon taking in more slides and while fighting the longer lines, sunbathing, reading and doing even more slides and the wave pool. NOTE: we did not do the Amazon River ""lazy river"" attraction as it was filled to bursting and did not look like it would have been fun at all. We did the wave pool last - it was your standard wave pool - perfectly acceptable. We did not do the Flowrider at all - although we spent a lot of time watching other people do it - which was enjoyable. We staked out a claim first thing in the morning for a chaise lounge with our beach towels. And I must say, our stuff (towels only) were not moved and our chaises were available everytime we required them throughout the day. (In other waterparks, I have ""lost"" towels that were stolen from us during the course of the day. Not the case at Raging Waters. This also applies to sandals and water socks. Everytime we chose to leave them outside the slide - they were there on the ground when we returned.) For an early supper we chose a slice of pepperoni pizza ""meal deal"" that DID include a drink this time and a corn dog - $11.00 total. The slice of pizza was HUGE and VERY WELL MADE! Yes, it surprised us too. They also sell a whole pizza (either cheese or pepperoni for $23.00 and I assure you it would be well worth the price and would feed six people at least - it is a huge pizza. The single slice is also very large - a quarter of the big pizza - and comes with additional parmesan cheese and red peppers - if you require them. Yum! Only one really negative note - line jumping and place holding (while prohibited at the park) seemed to be going on all the time. We have no problem confronting people who try this sort of thing and neither should you! We even saw one of the lifeguards allow his ""friends"" (two guys) to cut in front of 50 people in the line for the Dragon's Den. This is unacceptable in these situations where we all are required to wait in often long lines to go access these attractions of very short duration. It was the only real black mark on the day! Otherwise I recommend Raging Waters in San Dimas. It is no Noah's Ark Water Park in the Wisconsin Dells but there you get The Dells too!",TravelinManSMonica
20,Kids enjoyed it ...,"... but overall we did not. We went here after a quick search on the hotel internet brought it up as the nearest water park for our purposes - which was a day to relax in the middle of a fairly hectic touring holiday on the west coast.As we expected it was busy. Preference parking (near park $15) was full, so general parking ($10) was used, which meant a longish wait for one of the two trolley buses that take you to the park.Once in, very little seating in shaded areas - though I did manage to find a quiet spot up near the Black Hole ride.As I said, the kids (teens) enjoyed it - although queues were long. DH and I did manage to relax a bit (lazy river and reading), but couldn't believe that the park does not serve hot drinks at all - we would have killed for a coffee or tea! Also, the food was overpriced and poor quality - apart from a very nice fresh fruit salad ($8). The smell of pizza/fries/hot dogs hung over most of the park, which was quite yucky after a while.",Lymond
50,excellent,our family goes to raging waters every summer and it's awesome. if you go you need to get there at least by 7am even if it opens at 10am we are always the first one in the parking lot so we get the front parking and also in line to go in the park we buy our tickets in advance so we dont have to make two line one to purchase the tickets and the other to go in. you need to be smart and prepare for the day because it does get crowed it. like every other amusment park plan ahead and have a good time. oh you may want to take an ice chest with food and drinks cause it's expensive in there.,letty909
10,"NASTY, NASTY, NASTY!","We have recently visited Raging Waters in San Dimas. The experience could have been awesome had it not been for several shortcomings, which marred the whole impression.•Food is NASTY! For the exorbitant prices they charge for these gruesome concoctions they could have made an effort to serve something decent. Portion of sad French fries drawn in the sea of grease accompanied by unrecognizable substance proudly named “chicken sticks” costs $6.00! Cynical parody of Chinese food (“Dragon something Combo”) consisted of sticky sickeningly sweet mass of something swimming again! in the sea of grease. Cost -$10! Pile of colored crushed ice topped with stale whipped cream was sold as smoothie for $7.I completely understand that they are in business to make money, therefore food is not allowed in the park and the prices are high but at least have a decency to serve edible food!•Bathrooms are REVOLTING! Dirty, smelly booths with missing locks, meaning that 2 out of 4 were permanently out of order. Toilet paper was a history long before afternoon! There are NO hooks in changing cubicles! The entire place is completely hooks free! How about hanging clothes while changing? How about hanging hand bag while trying to perch on these smelly dirty toilet bowls? How about changing babies and toddlers? Have they ever heard of changing tables in the bathrooms? Especially in public places where thousands of children spend entire day playing in the water?•Sad dirty cloth hanging around couple of broken dirty plastic carcasses that used to be reclining sun beds in their former life is called CABANA and costs $85!We have spent $260 in your park and unfortunately I can’t say it was worth it. The rides were great and kids loved the thrill but we couldn’t get rid of the feeling that we’ve been grossly ripped off. Decent food (I am not even talking about some healthy options, hello, what year do we live in?) and clean bathrooms with minimal necessities, like toilet paper and changing tables is it too much to ask for the amount of money they are charging?I am sorry but I wouldn’t recommend this park to anyone and certainly plan another visit in the near future. Hopefully they will take this letter into consideration and make all the necessary improvements since the exciting rides cannot make up for the disgusting surroundings.",angelphillips
40,Tame or wild fun,"We went to Raging Waters on a Tuesday, non-holiday and thanks to knowing the right people/person, we got comp tickets. There were 3 adults and 3 kids (10, almost 7 and 41/2). We went early to get there at opening. If you want a seat to put your towel and shoes, you must get here at opening or before. We paid for the premium parking ($10) and parked close to the front gates. We brought lunch and ate at the car to avoid the bees in the picnic area. We all enjoyed Thunder Rapids and then the 7 and 10 year olds did Drop Out - I would say this ride is more for the very adventurous but our 7 year old enjoyed it even though he was the smallest person we saw going down this slide. Our 4 year old loved Kid's Kingdom and Splash Island Adventure. Half of us tried the High Extreme and had a blast. The lines do get very long after lunch so if you have a ride you'd like to try, get here at opening and do as many as you can early before moving on to the larger swimming/play areas. My sister wore Keen sandles and that seemed like a great idea once the sun heated up the ground. This is a very expensive experience so I would come only during the middle of the week, a weekend or holiday would seem out of the question and get here are early as you can. And apply sunscreen liberally before you get to the park.",Julauf
30,Very Fun,"Raging Waters is an extremely enjoyable place to spend the day. There is plenty of rides and attractions for the whole family and you will never get bored.There are places to eat, or you can bring an ice chest and keep it in the area provided for about five dollars. I would reccomend this, since food is expensive.The park, though fun, is not kept at it's cleanest. The floor is dirty and bees are everywhere. Bathroom floors are also discusting.The water is clean though.Renting a locker is also a smart idea. It's very hard to carry your stuff all over the park. You would have to leave them on chairs and trust nobody takes them, or just have someone stay buy your bags the entire time.Raging Waters is a very fun place to spend the day, though there is plenty of walking involved and a lot of sun. I am positive you will have a great time on all the slides and attractions, if you aren't too picky about the cleanliness.",hellooo_jellooo
10,Very rude staff,"I had a group of 5 people in my party and many of the rides are four people max of two. Even on rides where four people max the rude staff would not let only two board. and where there was a two people raft they would not let one board. Then two my suprise we went to other rides and they let anybody board (2 in a five person raft). seems the staff working the rides allow whatever number they feel like it. When i advised the manager of the park her rudely advised ""What do you want from me"" and offered a free drink pass. This was halarious to me.There are much better water parks n so-cal. Visit one of them",jg61982001
10,Absolutely Terrible,"We visited the park today, 23 July 2006.There are a number of reasons why we would strongly advise anyone NEVER to go to this amusement park.It took an hour to get off of the exit to our actual parking spot. The parking ""system"" is so disorganized that it backed traffic up onto the highway for a mile. Parking was $8. After waiting with hundreds of other people in the dirt lot, in 125 degree heat, for a bus to transport us to the park, we arrived 20 minutes later. Management has much work to do in this arena.The park was beyond crowded. We waited at least an hour for every ride (in the sun most of the time...not enough shade). There were long lines everywhere...for food included. Every pool was filled to the brim with people. Every chair and inch of grass was occupied. I think we were about the only people in the park that did not have at least 3 tattoos. I would never bring a child here.It is NOT worth the price or the drive.",Vard2006
10,Do Not Go! Repeat! Do not go!,"Took my daughter and grandkids last Sunday. Admittedly it was the 4th of July weekend, but we were told it was like this every weekend. Some of the problems are not the fault of the park, but they are not fixable either!It took 20 minutes to get off the freeway at the correct exit. It took another 20 minutes in line to pay for parking. ($8 to park in a dirt field.) It took (literally) 30 more minutes in line in the broiling sun without shade to get on a shuttle bus to the actual park itself. Since we already had tickets ($32 for adults and kids over 4 ft. tall) the next line (only 10 minutes) was to have our bags searched to be sure we did not have any guns, knives, or food. Then after changing into our suits (free) we stood in line for another 15 minutes to rent a locker ($5) to store our clothes.Unless you want to rent a ""cabana"" for $75 there is virtually no place to sit except on the ground, and you can forget about shade. The ride lines were humongously long, and the rides themselves were very short. The lines for food were long, and the food and drinks were rather expensive. (A large soft drink was $4.75, but you got to keep the cup and get a refill for $1.00).The place was not dirty, just fiendishly overcrowded and overpriced. Spend a few bucks more and go down the road to Disneyland ... you'll be much happier.",arnieman
10,very disappointed,"We visited Raging Waters in the summer of 2005 and were so disappointed. We had been there a few years before and had fun, but this time it was just awful. We had to park in a lot that was quite a distance away and get a shuttle bus. When we (finally!) arrived at the entrance to the water park there was an enormous line to have our bags searched. (I had already bought tickets on line, thank goodness, one less line to stand in!) I had a small bag of pretzels and a bottle of water and had them confiscated. An hour or more, after parking the car, we got inside the place...only to find there was not a spot anywhere to sit down or to put our towels and stuff. We put everything on the lawn waaaaaaayyyy back by the first aid station and (sweating profusely) tried to get wet somewhere. The wave pool was closed, (something they did every 20 min.)and the lazy river didn't have any tubes available. (they never had any the rest of the day, either, there were about 20 tubes and 2,000 people waiting for one!) We decided to get in a line to go on a slide. Here you actually get in a line for a tube, THEN you get in ANOTHER line for a slide! We were so parched from being so hot, and since our water bottle had been taken away, we went to a warm water fountain in between the two lines. When we finally got wet it was about 3 hours after we arrived. (No exaggeration!)I think the entire day we were able to get on 3 slides. To top it all off, the park was filthy. They sell drinks there that are served in carved out pineapples and people must all smash them on the ground when they are finished b/c it must be so much fun to do that sort of thing. Anyway, these smashed up pineapples were everywhere, along with ice cream and hundreds of BEES!While waiting in another loooonnnggg line to go down a slide (our 3rd and last one of the day) one of my kids got stung. He was in pain and since we were almost at the top of the stairs for the slide, we decided to slide down to First Aid rather than walk through the throngs of people on the steps. First aid offered ice for swelling. (not even some baking soda!) :( At least we were right near our stuff, so we could take the looonnggg trek back to our car!I actually saw the water park was still listed among the Top Ten on the Travel Channel and wrote to them saying they should reconsider! The program was showing slides that were no longer even at Raging Waters. (""The Wedge"" was one of them, that was fun, so I guess they decided it had to go!)I would recommend saving your money and going to the beach or perhaps there is a better water park in the area.",tinkerbell819
50,Love It,"I went to raging waters towards the end of August. I absolutely loved it. There's a good variety of slides and even though I've been to numerous water parks the ride dropout still got my heart pumping. By the time you realize just how scary the ride is, it's already over.It's not the kind of place you visit on a regular basis, but it's fun to go and spend the day every once in a while. Overall, I would definitely recommend.",Hatch30
