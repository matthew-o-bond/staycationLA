40,"Great Sound, The Worst Parking in all of Los Angeles.","The Forum has some of the best concerts you will ever see, so whether you like the place or not, you are going there. I love the Forum, but there are some aspects of it that are so bad you just want to scream.The sound is the best in town. Having been totally redone the sound system can't be beat. The screens are wonderful and you can see. Good seats up through section 200 are what you want. Section 300 is not great, unless you are at a game. We go to concerts. My grandson loves this place because they have a lot of food trucks and concession both inside and outside.The seats are not comfortable and they are tiny. When you get in no one working there seems to have a clue what door you go in. It is dark in there, and that is before the show starts, turn on the lights! It is a huge place and you may find yourself walking down several flights of stairs with little lighting.The parking is the worst. They have no idea where they are sending you, sometimes you end up going in a circle. Have fun finding your car after. They are also rude.Inside security is nice and so are the people working the concessions. But again, want to find your seats, good luck. Get there early.The concerts there are so great. So, suck it up and when it starts and the sound comes on you will forget the misery you were put through to get in. Have fun.",elizabethlascheid
50,Tame Impala,"One of the best shows we've ever seen. Parking? Convenient. Finding seats? Easy. Plenty of food options, clean/attended bathrooms. Great sightlines, comfy seats (could use more knee room) and great sound. We hadn't been here since late 1990s for a Laker game. This place will always hold special memories and I'm glad it's been maintained. Highly recommended to see at least once.",Geoffrey B
40,MANA,Great venue only thing is that its a bit old. I think that a semi remodel would make the place look great.,Javier
40,Good acoustics to hear Oprah,"My sister & I had tickets for Oprah: 2020 Vision Tour at The Forum on Leap Year Day. Jesse Israel led us in The Big Quiet: for 15 minutes, 13,500 people were silent. Tamela Mann sang the gospel song, Take Me to the King. Julianne Hough led us in invigorating dancing-exercises in place. Jennifer Lopez was the Special Guest. Oprah spoke with passion and conviction.Pay extra for VIP parking if you don’t want to walk too far.",Lena K
40,Vip parking not needed if you get there 2 hours before the event,"I arrived 2 hours before the event and was able to park just 2 rows from the vip section so I saved $15 by just paying for regular parking. I arrived before the parking lot cashiers arrived so I had to go around the block. I found a nearby laundromat that I could hang out in. Across the street a guy put up a sign for forum parking for the same price as the forum regular parking of $30. I bought nosebleed seats in section 226 row 22 and the view wasn’t too bad. A picture of my view is uploaded to my review. I researched ahead of time and found the Kareem entrance was closest to my section of the stadium. I found out from the parking lot attendant to leave at the first Kareem exit to turn left on to Manchester rather than the main Kareem exit where they force you to turn right. I still had to do a u-turn on Manchester because they didn’t let me turn left but at least I was to get out on Manchester which was the street I needed to be on to return my rental car. I also didn’t need to buy parking tickets in advance on seatgeek, they were charging expensive delivery fees to mail a ticket rather than e-ticket. As long as you get there early enough there will be no problem with parking at the forum. I also left the show a half hour early to avoid the traffic and was able to breeze back to the airport in time for my flight. I was worried about missing my flight so I erred on the side of leaving early. On my way there I came down Manchester from Crenshaw and mistakenly turned left into a cemetery, I had to get on Manchester again and do a u-turn to turn left on to Kareem.",Delilah
40,Awesome venue for a concert.,KLOVE Live cool concert with some exciting performers. Little pricey on the drinks but is to be expected in LA. Older venue but good VIP area and pleasant staff.,danielj9706
40,Bring a sweater,"Went here to see harry styles. It’s placed in a very interesting location and it’s kind of hard to get out of, but there’s a lot of parking. I believe I paid $30 to park at the venue. The lobby area isn’t super roomy, but it’s got a different vibe to it. Make sure to bring a sweater because it’s gets chilly! Would see more concerts here again",Tessa
40,JingleBall 2019,"Nice venue. Never been to a round arena, there's this patio that surrounds the building. And there were a few bars and food for purchase. They had a merchandise booth outside and it wasn't crowded which was nice.I had good view seats even though they were in the 2nd tier. The music wasn't so bad either except for the first act, hard to hear over the screaming fans.Long line to the bathroom, which isn't unusual except that it was kind of confusing since there were 2 entrances and people lined up on both sides.I was at first upset that security was telling me that I couldn't bring an umbrella into the arena when it was pouring outside. What did she expect me to do just toss a perfectly good umbrella? I took a shared ride so couldn't leave it in the car. Then I found out that it was just her. So 1. dumb rule and 2. inconsistency. Luckily I went through another security checkpoint with no problems.My sister arrived an hour late to the show and her uber driver had a hard time figuring out where to drop her off. I guess staff was no longer outside and I don't know if there were any signs.",Limeiyu31
50,Jingle Ball 2019,First time here and it was such a fun amazing experience. The process wasnt as smooth to get in as they only had 2 entrances and we waited in line for 2 hrs before we could get into the Village. Altho it worked out well before the concert. They had booths set up for photo opportunities and music. The concert was amazing and could hear clearly.,mdizX
40,Slayer and the finale,I always have a great time at this classic venue. The sound is great and with most the seats you still have a great view of the stage. The only drawbacks are the expensive parking prices at $30 and the expensive beer on tap which is becoming average across the board. We were attending Slayer's farewell tour and we had a great time with all the other metalheads.,Creeping_Death_LA
50,"Great venue , perfect accoustics",We went to experience Kanye Wests Sunday Service and the Forum turned out to be the perfect location for this wonderful music,Travelsv14
40,Kayne West Sunday Service,"I came here to a Kayne Sunday Service event and it was awesome!! My first time at the forum and it was pretty cool. Unfortunately, because of all the construction going on for the new stadium, parking is VERY crazy out here. It is advised to park a bit further and instead take an uber to the venue. It can get windy so make sure to bring a sweater. They check bags and metal objects so try to keep it simple. Considering that most parking right now requires walking over dirt roads and bumpy places, I'd suggest bringing shoes that you can afford to get dirty.",Brian
50,Great venue,"I saw Incubus here. I was in Sec A row F and was VERY close. Uber pick up can be tricky, but you can just walk down the hill. Concessions lines are quick, and bathrooms are close. I prefer this venue to Hollywood Bowl.",nixnelson
50,Great Parking available,"The location is VERY convenient. There are tons of good motels and restaurants on Manchester Blvd. I just walked from my motel and saved on parking. Had a great breakfast the next day at ""Joes"" mexican restaurant.",todd luton
50,GREAT VENUE!!,❤️❤️Went for the Eagles concert last year and it was amazing! You can’t get a bad seat. I will always remember that concert! ❤️❤️,cre8nsmiles
50,Still the Best,Since the Forums reopening I’ve attended a half dozen concerts or more. The venue is clean and offers plenty of pre concert food choices on the event deck. The sound system never disappoints no matter where your seat is located. I highly recommend checking it out if your favorite artist has plans to play there. Get there early for the best parking.,ca67vette
10,I Can't See It.,"This is the second time I was there for a MMA fight in the last year. Both times, I could not get a clear view of the monitor screens. I obviously did not pay top dollar for the finest seats, but my seat was in the common folk, middle class area. The main screen is big and bright enough, but both times there were light bars and lighting instruments in the way. there were two other displays, but they were facing the other direction so they couldn't be viewed from many of the seats. This is not an isolated issue for a couple of the seats. Hundreds, maybe thousands of seats are blocked from full viewing. All it would take is for a couple more displays, they could even be place on the backs of the existing displays so the other people could see. I get the feeling that the forum management doesn't care and just wants to sell higher priced seats.$30.00 for parking, but there are places in the neighborhood on the street that are legal if you don't mind parking in Inglewood.",imub4ur
50,Concert,Great concert venue.All Forum employees and security were efficient and kind.We Ubered there and back - better than parking there.,Calugo09
30,Queen concert,Parking was very poor planned.... parking was 30 dollars for 1 mile away and to park in the dirt... plus took over 2 hours to leave after the event,Gilbert Garcia
50,Blink 282 Rock Show,"Great venue, great sound, amazing Rock Show,Had floor seats in the middle 8 rows from the front, what a view, venue sold out Wow.Only one complaint, outside a large beer $8Once inside $14 , once you are in and if you get thirsty what choice do you have. Leaves a bad taste in the mouth.Make them $10 inside or out, that’s fair.Neil",Neil E
50,Forum 2019,I like the style of the new Forum. It doesn't not seem as big as before but better. The outdoor food and drink stands are everywhere and inside it was very plentiful too. If you use your visa you got a percentage off on food and nonalcoholic drinks. We even enjoy a Pinks hot dog before the show.,NorthStar12904648687
40,"Major event center, above average","The Forum, located not too far from the airport -- was recently renovated and is a better than average concert arena. Onsite parking is pretty decent, and usually does not entail too much walking. Unfortunately, they do rip you off for a whopping $30. They are very friendly to ADA vehicles, and strive to park you as close as possible. Last night, they parked me right up against the building itself, just 20 feet from the ticket entrance! The food and drink concessions are way overpriced. Nearly $6 for a 16oz bottle of water. And they remove the twist on caps, so that kind of limits you to one bottle per adult. (Tip: bring a plastic cap in your pocket.) The seats themselves are small, with very little leg room. But good visibility of the stage. Try to sit in the middle high sections; nose bleed is way up there and a lot further back, since the seating is bowl shaped angled back.",Fred G
40,Great Concert Venue,"Great venue for concerts. We attend Queen + Adam Lambert on Friday 19th.Fabulous sound. The seat are very comfy (we were at section 103, row 4) with no obstructed views of the scenario.The only ""but"" is the ""before the concert"" area, it could be better.",karife28

50,Eagles at the Forum,The fabulous Forum was bought by Madison Square Garden and converted into the concert event center it was always meant to be. A State of The Art sound system rocks the place. All attention is focused on the enjoyment of the audience.....bravo to the Forum,jerry k
40,Nice as concert venue,"We went here to see Ariana Grande. I had not been to the Forum in probably 20 years; well before it was refurbished to be a concert venue. I was pleasantly surprised by how nice it was. The facilities were all updated and nothing looked shabby, The seats were comfortable if not a little small. The staff was friendly and helpful.We got there two hours prior to the concert because I was concerned about parking. While the parking was pricey ($30 for general parking) we did not encounter any long waits to get into the lot as some people seem to experience if they wait until an hour before the event to arrive. Getting out was slow (maybe a half hour or so), but not terrible. It was nothing like trying to get out of the Rose Bowl. And if you choose to use Uber or Lyft just know to say the pick-up area is crazy is an understatement, and getting your phone to work (data) is not easy after a show. The cell towers must be completely overloaded. I'd recommend walking down the street to try to catch a ride if you feel safe to do so.Food choices were decent and prices as you would expect.Our seats were the first row of section 236. This is in the highest deck, but dead center to the stage. The only disappointing thing about these seats was that because we were near the top of the venue and straight back from the stage, the two big screens on either side of the stage were obscured by sound and lightning equipment hanging from the ceiling. That may not sound like a big deal, but it was annoying. I think the screens were part of the Ariana staging, so it wasn't really the venue's fault, but just beware.Overall, I wouldn't hesitate to go to another event at The Forum.",SDtraveler90
50,Great venue,Went to the Pink concert. The venue is GREAT! It's on the smaller side so it makes for a great place to see a concert. It was clean and the acoustics were great! Parking was easy and getting out after the show was way easier than I anticipated.,AJM
10,Buy Cheap Seats,"This place is an actual JOKE of a venue. If you want to go see a show, just buy the cheapest seat and then find an empty seat in the section you want to be in and bring your 10 friends with you. There are no ushers or security around to make sure anyone is in their actual designated area. We had seats 3 & 4 of a section and the people who were supposed to be in 1 & 2 never showed. So it was an open opportunity to have a rotating door of people who stood there, with their 5 friends, in the way of the rest of the people who paid to be where we were. I’ve been to many venues, and never have seen something like this before. Nothing like being asked to move over or make room for people the 5 people who aren’t even supposed to be in those 2 seats. Also, no cup holders so everyone was spilling their drinks on the floor, rows are tiny and uncomfortable.",lionsden7613
40,Big venue!,"They always host a concert, play, and religious services for large crowds. Parking is pricey , so have a game plan on parking",MARTHA J
50,Great show,We came to see a Cirque du Soleil show so it was a much smaller crowd which made everything easier for us. We didn’t want to pay $30 for parking so we turned down Manchester by the Sizzler and found a parking lot for $10. As we started walking we found a $5 lot as well. Just keep an eye out for the banners. Drinks inside were $15 a piece.,Hhogelund
50,Chris Cornell Tribute Concert,"We have been to a couple of concerts now at The Forum (Iron Maiden 2016 and Chris Cornell Tribute 2019) and both times we have loved the experience. The venue has a cool vibe with murals in the lobby where you wait before seating opens up. The vendors serve food and beverages quickly, and both times we got parked, in, and out relatively painlessly.",KatCinGe
40,"Good Venue, Great Sound","The Forum has been redone and the sound system is one of the best in town. I am so torn reviewing the Forum because it has some great assets and some things that just make you want to scream. We have been there several times since the opening, but this is my first review. The last show we saw was Panic at the Disco a few weeks back. I will start with the great things:The Forum is smaller than Staples, so you have a chance of having better seats. If you can get on the floor or in the 100 section. Higher than that you will need to look at the screens because the act will look like little mice. The sound system is great. At all the events we have noticed that it is not too loud and the sound is crisp and you can actually understand the singer. I am sure they spent quite a bit on this system and it was well worth it. For that alone, we will come back.There is great eats outside the venue so get there early and you can just snack or have dinner there. There is no seating in this area so you will be standing, but it is doable. If you use your Chase card you get a nice discount on food both outside and inside the venue. The food inside is also good, but the lines are crazy and it is not well organized.Security at the venue is very nice. The staff is not the best, so if you have a question try to find one of the security people. They know everything. Getting through security is not hard.The seating is satisfactory. I wish they had cup holders and the seats were not so close together, but they are fine.The downside:Parking is a joke. Get there early, at least an hour or good luck getting to the show on time. They will just keep moving you along having no idea what areas are full. If you are disabled you are in for a nightmare. Many of the ADA parking is used up by outside vendors. That is illegal, of course, but what are you going to do, argue about it. The price is from 25 to 35$ to park and getting out of there can take an hour. It is one of the worse set ups for parking I have ever seen and the staff is rude and not at all helpful.After the mess with parking at the venue we have taken to parking on the street and walking several blocks. Mind the signs. The problem with that is once you want to leave, you will be hard pressed to figure out how to actually walk out and no one will direct you at all or they will give you the wrong directions. Each time we have ended up having to walk over dirt or mud to get to the sidewalk. What a mess. But at least I did not get ripped off for terrible parking.Once inside it is very hard to see. We were on the floor for some of the events we went to and we had to walk down more than 3 long sets of stairs with no lighting and no rails. At one point I thought I was going to fall. The ushers will not help you find your seat. They will point into some vague area so good luck. Again, get there really early.The venue itself seems disorganized. For one show, they did not open the doors on time, security was at a loss as to what the wait was and felt for us. It was cold and thousands of us were waiting to get in. They opened the doors about 15 minutes before the event was to begin. What a mess.The bathrooms are far and in-between and there are not enough.Now, all that said, we will come back. They put on great shows. The screens are great for viewing and the sound is amazing. We always have a great time. I sure wish they would get it together on these other issues. Have fun.",elizabethlascheid
10,The Forum Is The Worst Venue,"We went to the Forum to see Bob Seger. This venue is a disgrace. They are crooks that run that place. It took 1 hour and 45 minutes to park. They keep directing you around the block over and over. We were passing parking spots that were open, but they wouldn’t let you in the lot. Finally they directed us to a dirt lot. $30, total bait and switch. There were no police there helping out, just these rude, untrained, morons with a reflective vest. They don’t have a plan nor can they organize an event with the amount of cars coming to a sold out concert. There is horrible access from the freeway or local streets to get to the Forum. The Forum needs to cancel upcoming events until they are able to properly take care of the patrons who paid a lot of money to come there. Many of people came by Uber, which was fine getting there, but when the concert was over, they would not let the Uber drivers in the lot to pick up hundreds of people waiting. These people now ran outside the lot, and were unsafely trying to get their Uber in the middle of the street. An ambulance would never be able to get through this mess in an emergency. LA thinks that it is a good idea to build a football stadium across the street. Really? What is wrong with these people? How will they ever get more cars down the same area for a football game?",jacquelinemI9662HD
10,Will Never Come This Venue Again,"Myself and about 30 other paying customer were sold fake concert tickets which was of course not the fault of the Forum. My issue is how they handled the customers who were already scanned in and seated by the time the ticket issue arose. I have never been treated so poorly by any event venue in my life. Our tickets were voided, again I get that they were scam tickets, and then we were unceremoniously escorted out but an exceptionally rude usher and left to purchased another set of tickets. Again, not an issue with having to buy tickets again, credit cards will refund the fraudulent set. As we were waiting to purchase a second set of tickets, the security guards were mocking us and laughing at us. Maybe they were getting their jollies off of this since minumum wage isn't much but me and the 30 other people who got scammed weren't laughing.",olddoglady
10,Avoid this venue,"General parking is $30. Staff directed us to park so close to next vehicle we couldn't open our door. We objected and they let us move over a bit. Tickets for Bob Seger were absurdly overpriced. $124 each + service fee for Sec 233 row 4. Beer $14.50, water $5.50, entire event is nothing short of legal robbery. Left before the last song to avoid the insane parking crush. Sound was fuzzy, could hardly hear Bob Seger sing he was frequently drowned out by his band. And of course idiots getting drunk and screaming for 30 seconds at the beginning and end of each song. Skip this monumental rip off and go else where.",ladinks
40,"KISS last night, U2, Eagles, Stones ...","The Forum was remodeled a few years ago to be a premier concert venue and I think that was a good success. The KISS show last night was amazing as was the previous show we saw there, U2. The sound was very good. We have seen many shows here.The seats are tiny to cram as many people in as possible. I am 5’11” and thank God I was on the isle because I couldn’t sit there with zero room for my knees. If you are big or tall you will not be comfortable at all!The staff and security were all much more friendly and attentive to details than at other venues in LA. I didn’t see it in men’s room but my wife said there was an a attendant in the ladies room and after some drunken idiot barfed behind us, the staff came and cleaned it up with some special powder and then sprayed. We also saw staff clean up people’s spilt beer outside on the terrace. This attention to immediate detail is not seen at Staples and other places we have been to.The food and drink prices you might expect to be high but wow, they are obscene high! We ate before we went so didn’t buy food or drinks. If you have a planned event you’ll probably get an email the day before to tell you to arrive early, ride share and enjoy the terrace. Translation means come buy our expensive food and drinks before the show.Then there is parking situation which was a complete nightmare for U2 so we went early last night for KISS and took Uber. It’s good to go early, just eat before you go. Going, Uber was easy and well organized. At the end of the show many of the hundreds of people who have used Uber were not impressed with the chaos and seemingly unorganized of the pickup from Uber/Lyft drivers. We ended up calling our driver and walking around the building and across the street to the Sizzler parking lot. This saved us probably an hour...don’t wait for a driver to come into the lot to get you or you will wait for ever since all the traffic is leaving and the Uber drivers are trying to get into the lot.If you plan accordingly you will have a great night.",ItchyFeet

50,Sir Elton John at The Forum!,My wonderful hubby bought tickets for us to see Elton John (for the 3rd time) and we couldn't have asked for a better show. He played for 3 hours straight and expressed his gratitude throughout the show. After 50 years on the road he still has an amazing voice and his piano playing - just out of this world! If you ever get the chance to see him - do it!,MaPuJe
50,Excellent concert venue,"After basketball and hockey left the forum, the forum has been turned into the perfect concert venue. Seems there’s concerts there all the time. This was an Elton John concert his farewell yellow brick road. Awesome awesome awesome.",PilotMichael
30,"Excellent show, frustrating exit","We took our first Uber ride over to the Forum from Marina Del Rey for $16 to see Elton John and our driver didn’t have any problem getting in a half hour before the show. He dropped us off and we walked across the parking lot to the entrance with no issues. Got in a short line to get through security and got to our seats with time to spare. The problems came with getting out. We couldn’t get an Internet connection to schedule a ride or even a taxi. It was super frustrating b/c I didn’t know how long that would continue, and it was 11:30 pm. There was a long line of people waiting in an Uber pick up area, so somehow they were able to schedule a pick up. But I could hear other people trying to schedule a ride, and it sounded like the drivers didn’t even know where to go. When they make it in, they pull up to a number and tell you where they are. You can walk to the front of the line and tell security where your driver is located, and they let you out. I finally went with a driver that just showed up to pick up jobs and had a flat fee of $100. At that point, it was worth it. He was able to drive right out, without waiting in a line of traffic. He said the lack of Internet was b/c of all the people trying to call at once.",JA M
10,The Forum,"Went to see Elton John last night, he was great but the parking sucked! We missed the first hour of the concert because of parking. There wasn’t enough parking for everyone and instead of letting us know they just redirected us around The Forum and back out to where we started saying sorry. I paid good money for a concert I missed a third of because of The Forum, I feel like they owe me something! I’m not the only one, I bet they lose a lot of customers... I’m not going back! It’s a good thing Elton John was great AND played for 3 hours or it wouldn’t have been worth all the hassle.The Forum isn’t worth it, see your concerts somewhere else!",GCG
30,"Excellent Elton John concert, challenging venue","We arrived 2 hours early and did not have trouble parking ($30 for general parking). It's a confusing mess getting in, first going through security and then out, waiting for the doors to open at 7 pm. The seats were comfortable but small. Visibility of the giant screen in our section was impaired by hanging speakers. The acoustics were good. The food selection outside was tacos or hot dogs with no place to sit down. The show itself was great, but people kept arriving an hour into the show. Getting out was a complete nightmare, with no organization and cars slowly, slowly creeping in long lines. I would avoid this venue, if at all possible, in the future.",CalifCar
30,Parking horrendous good once you’re in!,"If you’re going to a concert at the LA Forum, take my advice and go real early if you want to park in the parking lots. We went an hour early thinking it was enough time and the lots were full. Rode around looking for parking and missed the first few songs of Elton Johns good bye tour. As it turned out. We parked on the street, far walk, but when the concert was over, cars in the lots were at a stand stil. We walked a ways to our car got in and left. No problem. The forum itself was great for a concert. From now on, I’m parking on the street!",mathsupt
40,"Good venue, nightmare traffic","Ok.....The good.The concert hall itself is very nice, good visibility, and acoustics make even nose bleed seats decent.Plenty of bathrooms, and decently comfortable seatsThe bad.The traffic situation around the arena is apocalyptic.It took 2.5 hours to get from the freeway offramp to the parking lot.There was almost no organization or information.Even Uber drivers had no options.Everyone that could were getting out and walking.Do yourself a favor, park far away and walk, or get dropped off somewhere before the chaos zone.Elton John was great... Even though we were an hour late getting in, despite being there 2 hours early.",Muadib84
10,Elton John concert,"I will NEVER attend a concert at this venue again! The place is totally unprepared to handle the traffic of a sold out concert. I waited in a line of cars trying to get in to the parking lot for over an hour and a half. No police backup trying to direct traffic, just chaos and angry people trying to get to an event they spend a lot of money to see. Once we finally DID get parked which was over a mile walk, there was more chaos waiting to get inside. I have been to many sold out concerts in my life but never been in a mess like that. Missed first 3 songs because of what went on,",caligal742016

20,Security needs to do a better job at the front,"This is my 2nd time here for a concert. First time had full access VIP so we didn't have this issue. This time we came for the iHeart Radio AlterEgo concert. Amazing seats, we paid a pretty penny for them. Row C in the middle front section. Parking was a breeze, we did VIP like last time. Perfect. Facilities are clean. Security checked well. However, the security at the front of the stage were sub par. They let people stand on the guard rail for more than one act without checking their tickets. Some we even saw fist bumping the security. Then once we all started to complain. People in rows 1-3. They finally had someone come out and check tickets. Of course it was a fiasco. Once that man made it to the other side, those same people rushed to the front. SO ANNOYING especially when you pay good money to only have two rows ahead of you, not 5. So please be aware of this and I hope they read this and do a better job keeping the people out of the front area because its a huge distraction.",lovept
50,Chris Cornell Benefit Concert,"For a sold out show everything moved quite quickly. To parking, getting food and drinks.

40,A Wonderful Concert Venue,"Historically, The Forum was home to basketball, hockey, concerts and conventions. After a complete transformation to a concert specific venue, The Forum is seeing a second life. The acoustics are very good... I have seen many shows including The Eagles, Cher, Pink, and Eric Clapton, but was most impressed with the sound last week when I attended the Disturbed and Three Days Grace concert last Friday night. Halfway to the venue I realized I had left my earplugs at home, and was not sure how the heavy metal sound would bounce around the auditorium. In the end, the music was not overly amplified, was well balanced, and the vocals stood out clearly against strong guitar and drum beats. Besides the quality of the sound, the lighting and staging is versatile and interesting.Overall, I find the seating rows a little close together, which can be uncomfortable for long stretches...maybe that's why everyone stands for half the concert! I always opt for an aisle seat if I can to stretch my legs out. Restrooms can present long lines, especially for the ladies...those in the know use the restrooms outside, below the terrace, which generally have much shorted lines. Concessions are plentiful, and there is little wait time for cocktail or other beverage service. The taco vendor and cheesesteak company provide average fare, and Pinks hotdog stands are what you might expect. I generally just go for the beverages, and maybe a snack, and hold off eating until after the concert, when I will hit up one of the numerous ""Dirty dog"" street vendors that line up around the perimeter of the property (they used to be allowed in the parking lot, but have been forced onto the street the past three years).All in all I prefer The Forum as a concert venue over Staples Center because it performs as designed for that specific function.",Tim W
30,UFC 232,"Due to Jon Jones Picogram-gate the event was relocated by UFC from Vegas to ”cozy” Inglewood six days prior to the event. Located in the middle of nowhere with (to say the least) steep prices for food and beverages ($14,5 for a 24 oz beer) the arena is ok with a good view of the Octagon from pretty much any section in the arena! Section 227 was great!",Fretel1891
40,Please no seats on floor for Rock Show!,I was there for Ozzfest. Security was great. The outdoor portion of the concert was amazing. The drink lines were too long but moved pretty fast. Bathrooms were quite a walk but everyone was very helpful steering us towards the nearest bathroom. Bartenders were great! As the concert moved inside people were getting drunker. I spent 200$ on my floor seat and people were literally falling all over me. Please don’t put chairs on the floor again! At least not in the front!,Mrspantera

40,KROQ Almost Acoustic Christmas Show added the sparkle,"We saw nine outstanding musical performances at the Forum and enjoyed the show immensely. The acoustics are on point and even from our seats at the very top all was clear and not threatening to your system. I will say I didn't like being that far up at first but the view from the top was breathtaking. The staff are very efficient and friendly,respectful when asked a question. That's a rarity today in customer service. I didn't sample the food but the crowd seemed to enjoy it and all the libations available. The only negatives for me was the tight seating in the upper levels and the sticky wet floors. That was a bit disconcerting. I can't complain though because we were pleasantly surprised with a seat upgrade to the floor seats toward the end of the show. The view from there is definitely much better. All in all,it's a pretty nice venue for events.",Beverly C
40,""" Josh Groban Concert was Good ""","We went to see the Josh Groban and Idina Menzel concert at the Forum in Inglewood, CA. The seats we had were right across from he stage up front, and Idina Menzel came out first to sing for about 1 hour. She has such a powerful voice. We saw her in the Broadway play "" Wicked"" and she was really good at this concert. Then after a 30 minute break, Josh Groban came out to do about another 1 1/2 hours of entertaining the huge crowd. His voice is Awesome ! He sang some new song hits, and some of his famous songs also. We had a great night at the forum. The only down side for me was that the entire Forum even where the food and drinks were served was very Dark. It is dangerous walking around and getting o your seats because it is Too Dark !",David Miller
50,Great Venue,"went to a concert with my family, loved the venue. The acoustics are flawless. The staff is very friendly. I recommend more food vendors so the wait is not too long. Drinks are GREAT. Definitely recommend this for a concert.",Mina Mina
50,Josh Groban Concert,"We had a great time. We had floor level seats...we had a good view of the stage/Josh/Idina...until he went to the rear stage. He made a joke about the front seats being angry about him going to the rear...no one would have been angry/annoyed if he had sang with Idina on the front stage, but he did the 1 song with her on the rear stage. Disappointing, because I would have loved to hear more of them together.The venue was great for a concert. My only comment on the venue was the lady in the seat next to me arrived for the beginning of the concert completely stumbling drunk...and she kept leaving to get more to drink. She would lean over to me asking me if “I loved the concert”, did I “love Josh or Idina”.Trust me, I’m a 50yo woman, I’ve had my drunk moments...but I try not to inflict them on others in public...especially if I have to drive!! I’m just truly surprised that the bartenders at the Forum continued to serve her.",my2kidsmom9702
40,Nice to see updated venue!,"I haven't been to a show at the Forum since the '90s. Next door to Hollywood Park & in an area in need of upgrading, the Forum fell on hard times. New venues popped up & caused Forum to become virtually obsolete.Saw Phil Collins there last night. Had a blast! Parking, normally the reason we hate going to big venues, was delightfully, surprisingly easy to maneuver.My one big complaint: both seat sizes & leg room are much too small. My guess is they are looking to cram as many folks as possible into venue 😢Staff was pleasant and helpful.Did not try food/drinks.Parking starts at $25..",Joanne R
20,"Old, dark, cramped, horrible parking, that's the Forum","First BIG problem is parking. They rip you off for $25 to park in a dusty lot. Second they offer NO good way to use Uber etc. Dropping off can be accomplished but picking up is horrible. Masses of people trying to cross the streets to meet their ride elsewhere, it just doesn't work. The seats are so cramped unless you're a midget you are uncomfortable. Then comes the third world bathrooms. At one recent concert the toilets had plugged up and were overflowing. The bathrooms were disgusting with water and God knows what else flowing everywhere. Even after so much was spent of this venue it still lacks a lot. Chase got a raw deal.",Mark O
30,Game of Thrones Special Event,"The concert was amazing THANK YOU!!!! The venue is in terrible shape. The carpet is old and smelly. The lady that was guarding the entrance to the concert hall was falling asleep standing up, had no clue what was going on, could not answer directions it was terrible. Of course the food is over price as well as the drinks. The seats were not comfortable, it is time for a renovation.",Michelle C
10,Terrible view,"I understand that I did not get the best seats in the house because the event was mostly sold out when we got the seats. But come on!!! There is a difference in sitting in a row where you can barely see the stage, then sitting in a seat where you can’t see the stage nor the screen because there is some equipment and the ceiling closing up on you. I have never been at the forum and with this experience, I never will see another event here. It was a long drive that most definitely was not worth it. Plus, it was super hot I mean everyone was sweating like crazy, I guess there is no ventilation up there. The only way we can see anything was to go down a few rows and sit on the steps to see the screen. I don’t even know why they would sell seats that are not even visible for the screen. I’m NEVER going back there, but my suggestion to those people who will is to only purchase the seats that are closest to the stage. If you end up buying the cheap seats you may end up not seeing a thing. Might as well stay home and listen to the album in the comfort of your home.",S L
50,Amazing history!,"If you're visiting Los Angeles area or Inglewood and want to go to a concert in a very historic place, this is that place. The wall at the artist entrance is simply amazing in terms of the artists that have performed there. Who's who in the music industry. Great venue, great history, not that great area but, it can't be perfect! Highly recommended, though!",Ricardo M
40,Still a good venue to see a concert,"Located at the intersection of Prairie Avenue and Manchester Avenue in Inglewood, the Forum is a good example of an older arena that has managed to age well. Easily recognized because of its distinctive architecture, the Forum was opened in late 1969 and served as the home of the Los Angeles Lakers of the NBA and the Los Angeles Kings of the NHL until both teams relocated to the Staples Center in downtown Los Angeles in 1999. The Forum was sold to a church organization and was then acquired by the Madison Square Garden Company (MSG) in 2012. MSG renovated the Forum and reopened it as a dedicated concert venue in early 2014.We were here to see the Eagles, who ironically were the act that opened newly-renovated Forum back in 2014. I hadn’t been to the Forum since its renovation and was impressed by its condition. The seats were in good shape, the sight lines and acoustics were good (for an arena), and the staff was friendly. The biggest downside was that the aisles didn’t seem clean; in fact, they were a bit sticky, so janitorial may be an issue.Keep in mind that nothing about going to a concert at this type of is cheap, whether it’s parking, concessions or souvenirs. As long as you keep that in mind and are prepared, you can have a very enjoyable time at the Forum.",BruinDan
30,Venue is beautiful but acoustics are very bad,"Went here for Game of Thrones musical, but the speakers are only in center stage. If you are anywhere on top rows, you will not get a good sound. The concession stands get jammed packed during break.",pallav r
50,Excellent concert venue,"I have not been to the forum for so many years, it was back when the Lakers played here. They have transform this venue into the perfect concert venue. Was there to see the Eagles. Excellent excellent concert. Every seat in the house is a great seat. And comfortable seats too. I’m excited to re-learn of this venue for future concerts.",PilotMichael
30,"Nightmare to get in now, but good shows","I have been to the Forum before and I like the revamp. This review is based on how things are as if this writing. It is a combination of one star for the awful situation outside and five for the inside.First of all I love the stadium itself. We got really weird seats for the Eagles show along the side of the stage and sound was still great and line of site was still really nice. I loved the show and it just about made up for the horrible experience outside.So I always leave super early but we got a flat tire which I had to have repaired. But we still had two hours to get there and made it with about 20 minutes to spare. Then the nightmare began....No signage anywhere in sight and the new stadium is being built in the lot just a block away which means big areas are blocked off for construction. The staff outside were incompetent and inconsistent.We got in the right lane so we could turn right into the parking lot. Hundreds of cars went by in the middle lane and then were cutting back in making the delay even longer. But I don't do stuff like that, or at least I won't anywhere except at the Forum going forward.We finally got to the entrance to the parking lot only a couple of minutes late. But the awful employee who was allowing the other directions of traffic to enter had blocked off the only lane that should be able to go in and redirected us. This makes no sense and whoever made this decision should be fired, literally incinerated.So though we tried to do the right thing and while my wife was nearly weeping at missing her favorite songs, we had to pass the lot then drive all the way around it, completely circling the lot and then being directed away again and forced to park on the street almost a mile away.Those jerk drivers who were cutting people off and not following the directions of the terrible employees were comfortably watching the show half an hour before we were. You do with that information what you want. But even though I love the artists that play at the Forum, I won't be going back. They don't deserve it.",Ben Lomax
10,Lighting was awful,Concert was excellent but bright lights shining in your eyes the whole concert. Terrible venue. Many people complained but no one could answer why bright lights were shining at the audience and no one would do anything about the lighting. Do not go to a concert at this venue.,Murray B
30,Know where to park,"Contrary to other reviews, DO NOT park in residential areas! Parking enforcement is out in full force during concert events at The Forum. The bigger / more popular the event, plan on parking in the Los Angeles Stadium lot along S Prairie Avenue.Parking at The Forum will be reserved for VIP & ADA.PRO TIP: Drive from the West along E Arbor Vitae St, and you have a straight shot into the General Parking. Try not to drive along Prairie Avenue to get into the lot. It will be crazy busy and frustrating. Plan on being in traffic for at least an hour though, and hopefully you won't be frustrated.",suite662
10,"Terrible Experience, Misleading Ticket Sales","This place is horrendous. It's my first time here, my dad got our family tickets to see Game of Thrones the Live Concert Experience for CHRISTMAS; we've been waiting for almost a YEAR and from the parking situation, this whole experience has been a disappointment. Apparently, good, close parking is only given randomly (according to a parking attendant) so the van in front of us got in and we were sent over a mile away, which is not good for my mother. Then we get to our seats and it turns out the ENTIRE VIEW is obstructed by an awning, sound bar, and second smaller screen that shows nothing but close ups of musicians. NO ONE told my Dad that the seats would have an obstructed view because we never would have gotten them.My family LOVES Game of Thrones and our whole experience has been miserable. I'm writing this FROM our seats at intermission, time for Act 2 of the worst experience ever. I'm never coming back here if I can avoid it.",Taylor Y
50,Great Again,Well this will be my second review of the form and the old girl gets better each time. You appreciate the open parking and ease of getting in out. Easy ticket taking and fun to hang out having drinks and then head in for a concert. We were there to see Chris Stapleton who does not disappoint. Everyone should see a concert at the Bowl but real music should be seen at The Forum.,Kevin G
40,Good concert venue,"We attended the Jeff Lynne / ELO concert at the Forum. This is a good venue for a concert. As always, any concert can be wrecked by people who stand in their seats (usually women who seem to feel everyone wants to see them dance, even poorly). This show was no exception to that, unfortunately. That aside, the food is decent (not great, but not bad). Drink selection is decent. The smart thing this venue does is let you in and then roam around inside and outside to food and drinks. There is a very limited number of tables and seats outside, but far fewer than needed...still a nice feature. The acoustics are very good and so I would definitely go again. A major downside is the difficulty and lack of organization for getting out of parking. Expect that to be a 40 minute deal.",DaveTexas70
50,Helpful Guest Services,"Having booked ELO concert birthday tickets for my husband and not having had the best journey and hotel experience before we had even arrived, we were really disappointed with our allocated seats. Having travelled from the UK and saved my NHS salary to pay for the trip we were upset to find the view from our seats restricted in view of temporary metal railings. Donna in Guest services was amazingly helpful, understanding and generous. Donna very kindly provided better seats which were closer to the stage. My husband was thrilled and I was brought to tears by Donna’s kindness - which made our trip! The show was great. The venue itself was fine. The restrooms (although downstairs) were clean and well stocked, seating comfortable and the merchandise and refreshments competitively priced. We travelled by yellow taxi and found the lack of taxi signage on the way home confusing but once we located the queue (opposite entrance H) only had to wait approximately 25 mins. I hope the Guest Services Manager reads this review and conveys my most sincere thanks to Donna.",sweetjustine
40,ELO CONCERT,We arrived around 6pm for 8pm E.L.O. concert. Parking was very easy (or at least at this hour). Price to park was $25.00. For preferred it cost $40.00 but it is not worth it unless you arrive late because we got there early and parked right next to preferred. If you don't arrive early you will sit in traffic 4ever!!! Nice outdoor setup for pre event with tables and chairs (although all were taken by the time we got there) plenty of bars (32 Oz beer was $14.00). I saw Pink's Hot Dog and Boo's Philly Cheese Steaks concession stands. In the Forum there were plenty of bars too. Can't emphasize enough to wear comfortable shoes....the bathrooms are down in the basement and it is really annoying about 20 stairs to descend. And depending on your seats the stairs to get to your seats are STEEP so leave your heels at home! The Forum feels iconic/old with carpet and drapery and low ceilings but I liked it. The sound system was great. We sat in section 210 row 5 seat 12 and 13 which was the first row and an aisle seat that made it much more comfortable for us. I really don't think I could handle walking up and down those steep stairs. No cup holders but we were lucky to have a ledge where we could place our drinks. All the employees we encountered were great.BTW...if you are planning on staying at a hotel the night of your event DO NOT stay in Inglewood. It is unsafe. We knew this by reading some hotel reviews but some people we met learned the hard way! We stayed in Manhattan Beach area and it was great!!!,Lisa S
50,HAPPY TIMES,"If your concert starts at 8:00 try to arrive by 6:00 and you will not have a problem parking. Yes it costs $25.00 to park, it is what it is. There are places on the outside of the Forum to purchase drinks. I didn’t find the floors sticky and I found that there was plenty of workers to help you find your seats or what ever was needed.",Norma L

10,"No longer ""fabulous""","Having lived in Los Angeles for many years, I have fond memories of seeing many concerts at the Forum in the 1970s and 80s. With this history, I had a pretty open mind when we decided to see a show last night. What a disappointment! Perhaps it is my tastes that have changed but I found the venue to be too enormous to enjoy the show (not having splurged on floor seats) and the sound was not great. We actually left the show early, which at least made for a painless uber pick up. Parking looks challenging, I would suggest using a ride service if you go.",ojerio
50,Electric Light Orchestra Concert,"The Electric Light Orchestra performed at the Forum in Inglewood, California last night! The venue was great! We had floor seats and had easy access to the bar that surrounded the floor seating! The concert was awesome!",Jonny Vegas
30,"An Iconic, but Old School Venue","This review is just for the venue, not the band we saw play. The Forum is a unique venue. We loved the ability to float in and outdoors--with plenty of comfortable seating, games, activities, bars and food outdoors on a beautiful night in LA. In the flight path for LAX, a jet flew right overhead every 30+ seconds, which was, surprisingly not as loud as we anticipated. The interior felt like an old-time theatre, with heavy velvet drapes. There was a bar literally every 10 feet! I've never seen more bars at a music venue! Good selection of craft beers and they appeared to be fully stocked with liquor. Food was average concert venue fare. I did not remember anything memorable. Bathrooms were located downstairs, in a basement level, which could make access tricky if you have any physical limitations, but they were clean and well-tended. I'm sure they have accessible bathrooms on the first floor, but we didn't see any. The staff was quite helpful in assisting you with locating your seat. Parking wasn't great, but it was reasonably priced (unless you had VIP which offered GREAT parking...for a price!) TOO many children at a rock/alt rock concert!!!!! Felt like we were at Disney on Ice! I raised kids and can only say: parents--get a babysitter! Some parents who were acting responsible put headphones on their kids' ears-- but just leave them at home! Your 2 year old doesn't want to be at Imagine Dragons! Neither does a birthday party of 8-9 year olds. There was nothing to be added to the kids' lives to sit through music that's too loud for their young ears. Its just inappropriate to make your son or daughter wait in line with you at the bar for another cocktail. They're kids!!!!!The Forum was in interesting, iconic, old school venue; the parents were ridiculous.",Susan D
40,Safety first,This place has been around forever in a day!What I’d like to say is their drink and beer options are great.Patrol inside and outside the venue is secure.The forum still has great acoustics and easy entrance -exits. Traffic was controlled in a way where it flowed smoothly.If you are hungry after the show be sure to hit the sidewalks and grab the ever popular street hot dogs !,Bumble-Brig

40,Great venue,"I’ve watched three concerts here. Everyone that works here that I’ve come in contact with are very friendly. There were no issues with taking a purse like the Pasadena Rosebowl. The seats are comfortable and there’s plenty of leg room. They also had cup holders for our drinks. It was nice to have a waitress come take our food and drink orders from our seats in section 107. Otherwise, the concession stands outside were not bad as far as the wait went. We’ve also been downstairs in the VIP lounge where they serve food buffet style before the concert. There’s just not enough seats for everyone so we ended up sitting on the floor to eat. We’ve driven and parked here before at the lot across the street. Make sure to wear comfortable shoes. Last visit here, Uber dropped us off and there was a lady in a cart who offered us a ride to the front which was so nice. After the concert, we headed to the Uber/Lyft area and it was a quick and painless experience. There are attendants there to help you locate your driver. I like watching concerts from here.",878cheyennep
30,The Forum Tips,"Four of us just went to a Pink concert on 6/1/18 (she was awesome!). We arrived plenty early so getting in was a breeze. There were food and drink options inside. My advice for those looking to purchase tickets at The Forum:1) Do not purchase nosebleed seats in any of the 200’s rows 24 or above! We were in Section 209 row 27. That top section is covered by an overhang so your view will be obstructed a little bit. The worst part was the lack of air circulation though. It is very hot and stuffy up there. Row 23 and lower you are not under the overhang and the air is totally fine, anything higher and it’s pretty bad.2) If you plan on using Uber or Lyft I suggest getting picked up outside of the venue somewhere. The pick up area in the venue is very disorganized. Our driver couldn’t even get in to the pick up area so we walked and met him elsewhere.3) The Forum doesn’t really have much for accommodations around it so we stayed in Santa Monica. The drive took 1 hour on the way there (left at 6:00pm) and 25 minutes on the way back (left at 11:30pm).Other notes: the floors were sticky, the staff was friendly but there weren’t many around, the bathrooms have steep stairs going down to them.",Sally H
30,U2,"We had horrible seats. So I thought. U2 set a runway and landing down the middle odd the floor. Complete with video screens. The band ended up in front of us for half of the performance. What a great show! The Forum is the same, but redone. The parking SUCKS! $25 for parking in a dry and rock lot.",Hairup
50,Concert,"First time at the Forum...best venue of that size that I have ever been to. Parking was a breeze, lines were short and there were alot of choices for food & drink. Bathroom attendant kept things moving. Seats were comfortable. Saw staff cleaning up spills during show. Will definitely go back.",Robin O
20,Where Was Security?,"I have been to many concerts at the Forum since 1987. I finally had really good seats for the U2 concert on May 16, 2018. I paid a lot for that seat and had a wonderful view in section 107. Directly across from the smaller stage which was very close. It was almost ruined by crashers. People walked down to the isle and stairs and stood there. One drunk man even sat in my seat when I left for a couple of minutes. I was the one that had to make him move. There was not one single security personnel nearby. I had to go and find someone myself to make these people leave. Not cool Forum. For every event and every single venue I attend, If I put so much as one foot in the isle or linger more than a minute I am rushed by security and made to move. Even in nose bleed sections. I dont know what the problem was this night but I would advise to correct your security issues. I am very unhappy for once I had a great seat in a great location and security almost ruined it.",delmelsol
50,Come here for best concert experience,Tip: like any concert venue. Get to The forum as early as you can.But this venue does not disappoint with sound quality!! Loved all the concerts so far that I have attended at The Forum.,Kristina K
30,Parking! AAAAAAAAHHHHRRRG!!!,"Go with plenty of patience, and time. We went to see U2 for an 8pm concert, and were staying nearby as we flew out of LAX next am. It took 95 minutes to go three miles. There was no organization in terms of orienting cars to correct lanes for parking, just some kids in vests doing the best they could. We made it, just in time. Uber and Lyft lines on the way out were phenomenally long. In retrrospect, we saw a small place/business offering parking for 40$ a block from the venue. If you see this, just take it ( I think it was on Manchester). Parking is 25$ anyway. Good luck-once you get in, Forum is pretty nice.",Andrea S
30,"This Review is about the Venue, not the concerts.","The majority of reviews about The Forum mention the concert the reviewer attended, and not that much about the venue itself, well except for the parking issues. I wanted to make sure I gave enough information for all the people who come to Los Angeles and The Forum specifically to see a concert.The Forum was at one time the home to the Lakers and the Kings, and was renovated back in 2014 into a venue primarily for concerts and celebrated it's re-opening by hosting The Eagles.Since the renovation I have attended 3 concerts here and there are definitely pluses and minuses. Since it is for concerts, the acoustics should probably be mentioned first, and sadly they are not the best. Mind you they are better than many sports arenas that host concerts around the country, but that's not a high bar to begin with. Performers, their instruments and equipment, as well as the sound technicians can really make or break this part, especially with the massive reverb found at most sport arena venues. So although not the worst, outdoor venues like the Greek, Hollywood Bowl, or other amphitheaters in Socal are superior.The seats are not the best and are small but since I'm usually standing for a good part of the concert, it's not as big of a deal. Bathrooms were incredibly improved with the renovation and women have told me that the waits are not as long as some other venues. Concessions are not only inside, but there are usually tent and trucks in the parking area or the upper terrace, which really give you a great option for food and drinks. It would be nice if they also had a couple more access doors in and out, but that would cut into their space for bars. Right now it's 4 entry points with multiple doors, but the Forum tends to keep some of the doors closed and even have taken the hardware crash bars off so you can't access them.One of the biggest problems inside is the lack of cleaning that is done before an event. I was just there last night and the place was exceptionally dirty, especially since there wasn't any events held there last week. The floors were so sticky that you could hardly jump around while the band was playing.The parking, which is often criticized greatly on tripadvisor has never been a problem for me, however I could see people being upset just knowing the area and watching the attendants. I usually get to a concert really early, and at the Forum they have games on the terrace, usually some radio station giveaways, and dining so it's pretty pleasant. Since I get there early the parking is usually quick and easy, although it is a rip-off at $25 a car. Getting out is easy as well. The parking lot is generally well lit and there are always a lot of security and cops around. With all that being said, as I'm up on the terrace before a show, I can see the problems that people encounter. Also, I wouldn't park in a lot of the pop-up lots around or on a dark street. This is not the best neighborhood in Los Angeles so just be aware of that.",Bubuflu

30,Had a Great Time Here!,"We went to see Bruno Mars here so that could have had a lot to do with having a great time!!! Love that this venue is open again last time I was here was in the 80's. We got dropped off at the concert so that was perfect. Went home with a friend who had parked in the offsite parking which took us forever to walk to and even longer to get out after the concert. Get there early and get better parking if you can. The outside area was nice to people watch before the concert. Getting a glass of wine took quite a long time so i bought two rather than wait again later. Once the concert started I thought the sound was pretty good. I think most seats are fine as far a distance from the stage goes. The seats were very tight though...I am short so no problem, my husband is 6'2 so for him it was a problem. There were only very small screens up on each side of the stage which was just strange. Don't know why they wouldn't put up descent screens. 2nd time I have seen Bruno and of coarse he brings the place down!All in all I am pleased to have this venue back in the mix for concerts!! Plenty of scalper t-shirts before and after the show so if you want to save some money buy from them. There was aggressive security trying to stop sales though...I lost my change as a cop ran the guy off before I could get it. Still a good deal even without my change!",Jalama
40,One of my favorite venues because of it's Laker and Kings history!,"I love this venue. I have witnessed so many great events at this spot. It never disappoints! From the Lakers, Kings, John Mayer, Dave Chapelle, Prince, FooFighters, great sound and great venue.",Mike B
10,The DMV is better organized,"We attempted to attend a New Year's Eve show at the forum. As tourists, we made sure to ask our concierge what time we should arrive for the show. Traffic getting into the venue was quite bad, but we hear that is the norm. Once our Uber driver could get close enough, we walked in the rest of the way. After waiting about 10 minutes to get through the ticket line, we thought all was good until we were directed to the entrance ""line."" WOW - apparently they were using one entrance for this particular show and EVERYONE had to funnel through this one area. There were literally thousands of people waiting. There were no staff outside directing people and what few barriers were in place people were moving or jumping over. There were no lines, just a giant hoard of irritated people waiting to get in. We stood in this ""line"" for 1 hour and 15 minutes..... and moved about 20 feet. We could make out 6 (ONLY 6!!) metal detectors that were being used to screen everyone. At this point, we had missed over an hour of the show and at the rate the line was moving (it wasn't) we may have caught the last 45 minutes - no way to tell for sure. Not to mention people kept cutting into the ""line"" from all directions. According to the show information that was sent out, phones were not allowed & would be ""locked"" into a type of bag for the duration of the show. I'm not sure if this was part of what was bogging everything down, but the venue should make staffing adjustments to prepare for that. No where in the information sent however, did it say to arrive 2 hours prior to showtime to allow for security! This type of chaos is just asking for trouble & fights to break out as people were getting more upset and aggravated. We had a very early morning the next day and after making hardly any progress after over an hour, we decided to just give up and call it a loss - a HUGE loss. We were completely disgusted with the Forum and the lack of staff and complete lack of organization or efficiency. They obviously weren't prepared to handle the crowd, which is unacceptable because they obviously know how many tickets were sold. SHAMEFUL",Southerngirl
50,Great place for concerts - renovations are great,The Forum looks great! They really did a great job renovating the venue and optimizing it for concerts. We had a great time at Guns N'Roses. The seats are comfortable and the food and drink options are excellent.,John O
50,The Forum is new & improved!,"Came for Bruno Mars. Haven't been here in years. Currently in construction outside, indoors it's new & clean. Various food selections, women's bathrooms had plenty of stalls. Capacity not huge, not a bad seat in the house. Parking is far, lots of walking.",Iwannago2
20,"Terrible sound quality, stinky stoners","We've watched a couple of acts this year at the Forum. Bon Jovi and Guns n Roses.On both occasions we sat to the side of the stage so the view isn't bad but the sound quality is just terrible. Last night and Guns n Roses we were up high and there is a ""lip"" where the roof overhangs that blocks a lot of sound. It was like listening in a bathroom with a sponge on each ear.The attendants make no trips around the crowd to check on things either. We had a set of stoners that smoked joints all the way through the concert, interspersed with loud shouting that drown out the music. This forced many people to try and sneak to other seats. The attendants did nothing.Getting into the parking was messy too and the guys running the parking looked like they'd never arranged parking before, we had to move twice.",MBell_TA
40,Great to see the old girls again,"Seeing Guns and Roses tour again was a wish come true but to see them at The Forum was even better. The old girl looks great and there’s a real feel of nostalgia of going to there. The remodel for concerts is great and it’s easy to park, access, get food or drinks and get out. I took my daughter and we had the perfect concert experience.",Kevin G
40,Guns'nRoses Inglewood,"The Forum was renovated not too long ago. Nice red and white building from the outside. We ubered it and were early for the concert so it was a breeze getting into the building. Plenty of stadium fare, of course overpriced and not the most healthiest on the planet but no different than any other venue. Seats are new and fairly comfortable although leg room could have been a bit better. Even if we were on the second level we had a great view of the stage. Sound was fantastic, one of my best concerts ever.",radar60
30,"The size of the venue for concerts is good, but they are not up to speed on transportation or competent ushers","I had forgotten how out of the way The Forum really is. We had very good seats with a great view of the stage---unfortunately the two people in front of us refused to sit the entire night--when the rest of our entire section was sitting. Yes, we all get up and dance to a few songs, but not everyone wants to stand all night---if you do, one should order floor tickets. For the prices one pays for seats, Forum ushers should be asking folks to sit. Ridiculous prices for beer I expected, but the venue needs to move in to the current when it comes to transportation. The Forum needs to spend some money (interesting concept) and create drop-off and pick-up areas for Ubers, limos and taxis. Our Uber driver was hassled by the police for trying to pick us up---I am a great supporter of our people in blue, but they were overtly aggressive toward Uber drivers picking people up--almost wondering if they wanted people to drink and drive. The solution--the venue needs to create a space for the growing group of people using alternative transportation---we saw countless Uber drivers getting tickets when trying to pick up patrons--bad vibe for the venue.",adalbert3
40,"My first visit was in 1980, so the trip back is always nostalgic","You just can't miss The Forum and that iconic look/shape when you drive up to it - for me, it elicits NBA at its finest; I used to go to the Lakers games there all the time in the early 1980s. I then saw Bryan Adams in the mid-late 1980s, and my first visit back in over 2 decades was to see Pitbull in 2016 - and how great it was! Now, I should tell you that I purchased a single ticket for Pitbull and sat in Section 205, Row 2, Seat 13 and it was phenomenal because the price was right, and there was NO SEAT IN FRONT OF ME, thus I could stretch my legs out, and for a 6'0"" woman, that is CRITICAL! It was the perfect seat and I will buy that seat again in the future - the view is unobstructed (there is a plexi-glass barrier that you kind of see through if you're sitting down, but you are well above it when you're standing, and really, who doesn't stand at a concert?). Anyhow, I loved that seat! The sound was very good - not incredible, but very very good. The outside perimeter of the arena is usually open prior to the events and they've got vendor kiosks selling cocktails and some food - high prices, mediocre food, but that's standard. The restrooms inside the venue were clean and my wait time was minimal. Inside I only ordered bottles of water, all good there. As a lot of reviews have said, The Forum is a smaller venue than the Staples or Honda Center, so the views are better and it's more cozy. NOW, for my negative statement: I went and saw the Scorpions (October 2017) and was uncomfortable as hell; this time I went with a group of friends and shelled out quite a bit of money for a good seat (Section 102, Row 12, Seat 1) . . . As I mentioned, I'm 6'0"" and I'm not a huge woman, but I'm bigger than most - for the women reading this who will understand, I'm a size 14 pants, XL top - and I was sausaged into that seat like nobody's business! It truly was NOT comfortable - and how I wished I had been sitting up top again in Section 205 with leg room galore and what seemed to be a little more butt-wiggle room ;-). The Scorpions did sound great by the way. So overall, I really like the Forum, but sitting closer to the floor the seats felt much smaller and my leg room was non-existent - I had to straddle the seat in front of me the entire night, and this is not necessarily a great look for a woman. As to rideshare? Oh Lord. They have a system, but yikes, be prepared to wait a long time post-show. Uber'ing/Lyft'ing there was no problem, but aftewards? They have a designated pick up section - G, or maybe H? Either way, you head over there after the show, request your ride (you should probably do it before you get out there) and then you have to wait in this corral area they have for you. Your drive enters the parking lot and parks in a numbered space and then your driver tells you what number he/she is in (make sure to tell your driver to call or text you with that number of the parking space because The Forum ""police"" won't let you exit your corral unless you tell them what parking spot your driver is in). So the system seems okay, but traffic is a nightmare around The Forum after events, they close some streets and make others one-way, so your Uber or Lyft driver may sit in a traffic A LONG TIME before they even get into the parking lot. I had TWO (2) Lyft drivers cancel on me - one called and said ""hell no, I'm not waiting in that, peace out!"" hahaha, seriously. Finally, after the second one cancelled we walked across the parking lot, across the street to the line of taxicabs waiting and took one of those back to our hotel at LAX, but be warned - the ride back in a cab was $38!!!! The ride to in a Lyft was $8! Good luck, and have fun.",Jana M
20,Walked out after 45 mins,"Extremely disappointed with the Bruno Mars concert here. Sound quality was horrible. Acoustics were unbelievably bad. Bruno Mars is a very talented musician who sings incredibly well live. He sounded like a mess at the Forum. I've seen him at Staples Center, The Hollywood Bowl, and at The Gibson Theater at Universal years ago. I'm a big fan and am usually thrilled to see him perform live. Spent 4 figures on 3 floor seats for this concert and feel as if I threw my money in the trash. Couldn't stand to be there for more than 45 minutes of his show.",melliz818
50,Great venue.,Get there early because getting in to park can take a long time - only drawback. Other than that - easy view from anywhere - clean - seats are comfortable.,412terril
50,Bruno Mars,Great venue for a concert and it is more intimate than Staples. Sound quality is awesome. Easier to get to. Location is very accessible from the freeway.,Tanya S
50,Enrique Iglesias & Pitbull,Enrique was great very grateful for his fans and very respectful .As for Pitbull he was also great except for his back up dancers they were dressed as if you were in Vegas seeing showgirls which i found very wrong as for me im a female i dont want to go to a concert and ending up seeing half naked women . I would think more woman want to see him than guys so why mot cater to is women we want to see guys dancing up there we are there to be entertained by men not women so i think if your planning to see Pitbull and your there with a guy hes going to like it ot more than you So Pitbull remember we want to see guys up there with you.And also since they were both Enrique & Pitbull were going to be there i thought they were going to sing together the song I like it i was soooooo disappointed because only Enrique sang it,Lourdes D
40,Venue is nice- Watch out for steps...,"The venue is pretty good. Seats are comfortable and well placed. Unless your height up, then too far from the action. Floor seats are very close to the actions.There are steps to get the restrooms that can be treacherous if your not careful!The restrooms are located outside the hall and well out of the way. The outside parking situation was cool, close by but $25.",ReviewGuyNoVI
40,Good job of Renovating the Old Forum,Easy parking and good renovation. There are nice selections of places to eat and drink plus the upgrades of the facility really help the concert going experience. Worth seeing a show at the Forum.,Thomas S
50,Great Concert Venue,At first i was a bit skeptical about the location but once we arrived i was pleasantly surprised. We had a great view and the staff was very helpful. Large parking lot and found parking right away and close to the venue. We arrived while they were doing soundcheck and you could even hear them outside and it was really easy to find out seats. Traffic leaving the venue of course was a bit hectic but that's expected at any concert. Lots of bathroom stalls and was very clean. Great experience all around,Kimberly T
50,Megadeth !!!,We went to see Megadeth and Scorpions and what a great venue it was. The sound was perfect and the fans made it even better. Get here early as the traffic and $25 parking makes me want to tailgate to save some money from the expensive prices inside too.,Creeping_Death_LA
40,Great concert venue,Classic LA arena. Nicely remodeled inside and now owned by Madison Square Garden. Large parking lot makes it easy to park. Traffic can be a mess so come early.,Phil W
20,Eric Clapton Concert VIP. The concert was a 10!,I went to the Eric Clapton Concert which was wonderful. Amazing performer! He didn't stop between songs just kept going the whole concert long. I had VIP passes so we got to enjoy dinner and a cocktail before the show. All of that was a 10.The low scoring is for the seating at the Forum. Whoever designed the seating either never sat in the seats or was a very short person. I am 6' and my legs could not fit in the seating without having to turn to the side. Fortunately I didn't have anyone next to me.,Cgrl3700
30,Parking much easier than people say. Only take small handbag. Food/drinks way over priced. Uncomfortable seating.,"Went to Eric Clapton concert while visiting from Australia. Staying DTLA and had read nightmare reviews of drive to Inglewood and parking at The Forum. We found that was all false - easy 30 min drive from DTLA, quick access to parking within 100m of entry, and just as quick leaving after concert.Wife's handbag was rejected by security check as being too big. Seemed inconsistently applied and required a walk back to the car.Leaving early in readiness for the drive/parking problems meant over an hour wait hanging around the venue before the concert. Would avoid that if going again as the food outlets were average and very overpriced. Yes, I know they always are and Australia is the same but it was excessive here. Think four times normal store prices instead of double.Seating is narrow and very close between rows. If you are over 6 foot and/or 90kg (which I'm not) expect to be very squashed on all sides.There was a group two rows in front of us who openly smoked dope for most of the show. No action by nearby venue staff to stop them. Our kids sat in a cloud of smoke for 3 hours. I couldn't care less about it being dope but what about the no smoking rule .... just what you need, burning joint being passed around between stoners in a dark crowded venue ..... but a hand bag being too big is a problem!!",Neulara
50,Eric Clapton concert,Fantastic night. We had first row seats in Section 129 and they were awesome.The arena itself looks great. A nice music venue for all styles.,FlexMartian
40,Iconic venue,"I was at the Forum for the Eric Clapton concert. The Forum can be easily from the highway 105. You don’t have to get lost in Inglewood and that’s a relief. I like the oval shape of the venue. Lit with white and red colors it is elegant. The inside is easy to navigate. Rows and seats are clearly marked and there are ushers everywhere. Seats are OK, not too uncomfortable. I had a glass of draft beer and it was 12$. Expensive but at sports events or concerts you expect to pay premium prices. Beer was good (an IPL) and not watered down. The thing I like about the Forum is that you have a good view from almost every seat. We were in the 200 section and it was perfect.",Hanan C
30,The Forum,Went to see Eric Clapton. Love Eric Clapton’s music. The Forum does not do it justice. I think this place is better for sporting events. And you have to pay $25 just to park. And a beer costs $12.50. Rip off!,Bob P
40,Eric Clapton,The Revitalized Forum is a premier concert destination in Los Angeles. Acoustics are awesome and the place is clean and beautifully remodeled. Parking is still a pain when exiting.,hbteach86
40,Easiest venue to navigate,"Was at The Forum for the Ricardo Arjona concert 9/9/17. Such an easy venue to navigate. Traffic control security guards were so confused. They weren't allowing UBER of Lyft driver to the Rideshare section, so a big group of us had to walk to other meeting points. What's the point of Rideshare section if they were only letting Taxies in. The problem was rectified, but a briefing and consensus from the beginning would avoided a lot of chaos.",Lory S

50,Lady Gaga and the forum was up to the challenge,"Got dropped off by Lyft - check pickup location before u need to. The forum is an imposing sight and indoors the same. Concert pretty much sold out and great vibe with the excitement spilling, had seats in 227 and had a good view as she made her way across three mini stages on the floor,",johnnycash3630
40,Lady Gaga Concert here,"I won tickets to the Lady Gaga concert last week and got to experience the Forum for the first time. I arrived 2 hours early and parking was a breeze. I paid for VIP parking. Getting out at the end of the concert was the best I have seen. Moved the cone in front of me, pulled right out and on the road in 3 minutes.The venue is nice, I had floor tickets. I appreciated the small bar under the stands and bathrooms were ample. The only issue I had was lack to hand soap in the restroom. NONE of the sinks had soap which to me is a huge hygiene issue. Yuck!!Other than that, it was a great time and I would come back to an event here.",lovept
40,Beware of Parking!!!,"Nice venue, albeit older. We went to the Lady Gaga concert this week and FORTUNATELY decided to take Lyft to and from. Drop off wasn't great, and the driver didn't really know what he was doing but we knew to get off and walk a few blocks.The pick up area was interesting, Many people selected people who were a few minutes out because they knew it would take a while to get there. I recommend getting close to the Lyft/Uber area first, then select someone who is there. The folks that chose a drive 5-10 minutes out ended up waiting a long time because those drivers got stuck in traffic. The smart drivers don't turn on their signal until they're in the parking lot.",JDinLA
50,Love this place!,I am an avid concert-goer and also worked in the arena business for many years. The Forum is something special. Parking was SUCH a breeze and you're so close to the venue. The concessions outside on the concourse were a nice touch. The inside of the building is so cool - so much history. When Madison Square Garden bought this venue a few years ago and gave it an update - I am so glad they decided to keep it old school. This place is just so cool and filled with history. It is now one of my favorite venues.,Julie G
40,Concert at The Forum,The Drive to The Forum is tough on any given day. The Forum has been remodeled for concerts. I've been to multiple concerts at The Forum. It is a good venue for music better than places like staples. Getting in and out is easy and there is plenty of parking. The seats in side happen to be pretty nice. Sitting on the side of the stage isnt recommend. There are no extra screens for you to see if you are high up.,nelson t
40,Not a good neighborhood,"We were there for Wrestling Worldcup in 2016. The building was fine and the matches were great. There was some kinda security guy that wanted us not to cheer that got booed by the crowd there. We got out for lunch and there was not literally any choice so you had to either drive a lot far or walk too much for a McDonalds. The neighborhood is not much of appealing so if you can take your own food, it is a lot better. There were no food options in the forum",Abe
40,Good concert venue .. and affordable parking nearby,"We attended the Matchbox 20/Counting Crows concert on July 31, 2017 and had a very enjoyable time. Rob Thomas was phenomenal. There were some technical glitches but Rob handled it all with aplomb. The venue itself is satisfactory. The seats are a little bit cramped but adequate And even before the lights go down, the place can be quite dark. Therefore, using your cell phone to light the way is a good idea. Parking in the venue itself is $25 or more and a similar rate applies to locations on Prairie Avenue. However, if you venture onto one of the side streets (e.g. near the Sizzler), you can get parking for $15 and your car should be perfectly safe.. The acoustics in the Forum are pretty good and the staff are courteous. Overall, not the most spectacular or special of venues, like the Hollywood Bowl, but provides a satisfactory concert experience.",vincemc
50,"For an old venue, the Forum is dialed in!","Last time I was at the Forum, it was probably over 20 years ago... and just saw Garth Brooks there last night and all of it was AWESOME! From security at entry (fast and efficient), the many, many (I can't say ""many"" enough!) beer/drink and food stations, both around the exterior and interior - were fantastic. The food was really good, and the beers were big, even though it was a tad pricey, but we expect that at any venue. We were impressed with the great beer and nearly full-bar selections too - yay!There's nearly no bad seat at the Forum, and the sound is incredible... just the way a live show should be.",kalai k
50,Excellent Sound!,"My daughter and I attended the G-Dragon concert here. I was impressed by the sound quality of this venue. I don't think there is a bad seat in the house either. Before the concert, there is the regular concert food and drink available and not too steep in price. Security was discreet and there are ample entrances so there was no pushing and shoving to get to the seats. One of the better concert venues I have visited. Clean and friendly.",muttley56uk
40,Better Than Expected in Every Way,"I attended a near capacity Garth Brooks concert and had heard nightmare stories about parking, the venue, the area, etc. I ended up parking at the Forum in the $25 lot (there is a $40 VIP lot) and it was totally fine. Got right in, was directed where to park and was out and at the doors in 10 minutes. It had been many years since I'd been to the Forum (for a basketball game) so I wasn't expecting a lot. However, I really liked the venue. It's a little dark inside, but it matches the old school vibe. The seats were easy to find and it feels smaller and more intimate than other newer venues like Staples. The one knock is that the seats are pretty tight and my knees hit the seat in front of me (I'm 6'1"" 225lbs). It was tight for me, but for the guy 3"" taller and 70 lbs heavier next to me (luckily there was a seat in between us) it was almost impossible. Luckily we stood up for most of the concert. Getting out of the venue was no problem. We got out of the Forum pretty quickly maybe 15 minutes to get out of the lot and were at Roscoe's 10 minutes later. 4 stars just because of the tight seating. Overall, a great experience and will gladly go back.",RMKH
40,Pretty good!,We were just there for the Garth Brooks concert. The outdoor games and food/drink facilities were great! Decent amount of washrooms as well.,Albertacanadafemale
50,Greatest Sound Ever!,"I am from central California and when first hearing about my son wanting to attend a concert in Inglewood my initial thought was NEVER IN YOUR LIFE, because I have heard the area is very unsafe. Although reluctant I caved and we visited The Forum. The Sound you experience from this venue will blow your mind. I can't say enough how amazing the sound is in this venue and I'm sure it has to do with the colosseum shape but attending a concert here will be an amazing experience you will never forget. The venue is very clean and there are plenty of staff members inside to help you find your seats or find bathrooms or help you with anything you need. There were plenty of food and drink stations that I didn't actually visit but they were available. Also there are game stations outside the venue where you can pass time playing games before the concert. (Example of games XL tic tac toe & Horse Shoe type games) I didnt get to see them all but they looked very fun. I read parking was a mess so we ubered to the venue. After the concert the venue provided a LYFT station for people wanting to lyft home however the lines were long. Along with lyft there were rows of Taxi's ready to pick you up and that's the route we chose home and it was very convenient to have the taxis there after the show. I stayed in El Segundo and that was close enough to this Venue...only a $10 uber ride to this location and the taxi from this location was $20 back to our hotel in El Segundo. (El Segundo was very safe and quite)",marsbar112
50,Awesome Venue,Easy parking easy to find seats great security and awesome venue. Staff was amazing very helpful when trying to find bathrooms with shorter lines. Food variety and drinks is great. Sound during concert was great,deechicanamum3

10,"Parking chaos!! Past, present and future! Beware of missing your show!!","I WILL NOT ATTEND ANOTHER EVENT AT THE FORUM UNTIL THIS ISSUE IS RESOLVED. PAY FOR TICKETS, SEE PART OF YOUR SHOW!!My wife had so eagerly awaited the Game Of Thrones concert experience. We have visited the Forum so many times but now the parking at Hollywood Park is under construction and the Forum has no alternative that is adequate to the patrons. It took over an hour to get two blocks to the parking entrance and be told the lot was full. We were directed forward on a parking nightmare, 50 minutes and .8 mile away, we were parked in a vacant lot. By the time we got inside, the show was well under way. After contacting Forum Guest Services by phone, they claim there was currently a meeting underway to address the issue so I assume the issue is new, WRONG! Look at other reviews and talk to people to see the issue is not new but allowed to exist. What an insult! Emails have gone unanswered and it is obvious that MSG Group that owns the Forum doesn't care if your event is ruined by parking incompetence. I have never heard so many patrons yelling from their cars in absolute frustration. No email prior explaining a parking problem or ways to avoid congestion. I saw residential side streets completely jammed with stand still traffic, glad I don't live there. Such a sad way to run a venue and treat people who pay to see an event.

10,Parking Nightmare!!,If I could rate this in the negatives I would! What's so fabulous about the Forum if you can't even get in because there's no parking? Got to the venue 45 minutes before the show and couldn't even find parking at the Forum OR Hollywood Park! An hour and a half AFTER the first act went on and we're still in a long line of cars being directed to where? Just been told everything is sold out and there's no parking in the vicinity! So guess we're just eating those $500 we spent on the tickets! I'll take the Staple Center over this!! Plus no good restaurants in the vicinity and no real food to be found in the Forum. Only real positive are that there's lots of bars to buy overpriced drinks. Never coming back to this Venus again!,Love2Travel

It was wack that I had to pay more for parking ($25 vs $15), then a gain the walk inside was shorter and leaving was a breeze.Once inside we got in the beer line which was closest to our seats. It wasn't a fill bar but they served snacks, two kinds of beer (Shock Top & Coors), and hot dogs.

January 28th, 2017. The Alt-Roots Rock group 'Deerhunter' from Atlanta opened for KoL. This Big Grizz Bear was very satisfied overall, my brother did the drive up and parking was a cinch (we arrived early) and seating was good. Acoustics was a bit on the loud side, but I enjoyed the concert overall and met a nice family from the San Bernardino area (they drove almost 2 hours!!) For being local, we escaped the post concert traffic by taking Arbor Vitae westbound to Aviation past my old neighborhood instead of taking Prairie or Manchester (out of towners, you take Prairie and Manchester boulevards, ok?) I grew up going to Kings hockey and Lakers basketball when I was growing up and now it's a fine concert venue. FIVE CLAWS UP!!!!! Gay friendly. Thanks for reading my review. Joe G. Bear - formerly of Inglewood - now in Redondo Beach, CA",Joe G. Bear
40,Fight night review,"We got free tickets and sat in section 205, row 6. Seats weren't bad, but normally we'd pay more for better seats. Big screens all around to see the detail of what was going on in the ring. MY bf brought binoculars, so he could see everything up close. Women's bathroom was never a wait, but then again it was fight night. The main complaint I've seen is about sticky floors and they are sticky. With $8 soda and $15 beer, I say at least $1 from every drink purchase should go toward mapping the floors with more than 1 pass.",chinadoll418
40,The Forum Is Fabulous Again,"Joined friends for a concert. It was my first visit sine this big remodel/refurbishment of the historical place. Being from LA, this is the place where I attended my first concert as a teenager - when the Lakers played here. Inside they have some nice concession stands and what appear to be new floor level restrooms if you don't want to brave the steep staircase down into the basement level restrooms. Inside the walls are all painted black and draped so the focus is all on the stage. The retired Laker jerseys on the high walls are long gone. They've replaced the seats but they're still awfully close together and have nearly no legroom - so expect to be uncomfortable after a few hours of sitting if you are taller than 5'9"". Because of its intimate size, acoustics are amazing. There's no bad seat even if you are on the upper concourse, the view and sound is great. I've seen so many great artists here and thanks to the late Prince, who played here for 21 nights to prove that The Forum was a historic venue worth saving (a local church bought it after the Lakers and the Kings moved to the newly opened Staples Center). This is where I enjoyed watching Jerry Buss' ""Showtime Lakers"" where Kareem Abdul-Jabar and Magic Johnson graced the court and led LA to championships. This place is legendary and a great place to enjoy live music.",twenty1again64
10,They've got to be kidding,"We came here to see Toruk and our first unpleasant surprise was $25 for parking. Who charges $25 for parking? Then when we were in line we were notified that purses would be searched and no cameras or water allowed. Back to the car we went to return our water and camera. Are they serious about cameras not allowed? Everyone in the forum had a cell phone, and the constant flashing of cell phones with someone in the row ahead of us taking pictures and videos, and then reviewing them. Very distracting. Going out during intermission we could see why they didn't want you to take in any water. They were selling beer for $13 and bottles of water for $4.95. Yes, the seats were good with stadium style seating and the light and sound was good, but as a venue, this place is simply too big and greedy. Cirque du Soleil shows off much better in a tent. We will not be back.",lespes
40,Good View - Icky Sticky Floor,"This was a great venue and it looks great since it has been redone. Since it is a small venue any seat can be a good seat. I was however totally grossed out by the floor being so sticky. If I had known this I would have worn different shoes. I had on cute flats but they kept sticking to the floor so much so that they on a few occasions I stepped right out of my shoe. I do also like the fact that they unisex bathrooms, especially since I couldn't find the ladies room.",Ulvgirl
40,Dixie Chicks--Great Acoustics,"Growing up in Inglewood, The Forum was the iconic venue in the area. Seeing Dixie Chicks on October 8th was my 1st visit to the refurbished venue. New seating was comfortable and the acoustics were great--Dixie Chicks were even impressed by how clear the sound was. The staff was extremely helpful and friendly. (One exception--They opened the doors 30-45 minutes late and no one was willing to provide an explanation.) Unless you want a Pink's Chili Dog, a Philly Cheese Steak, a Pre-packaged Sandwich or other Concession food, pickings are sparse. I was disappointed to learn The Forum Club which provides personal service and better food is now invitation only. There was plenty of Alcohol for everyone. Parking is between $20-30 on site and in the surrounding area--very consistent. Looking forward to my next concert in December.",Gina S
50,Gwen,"A live concert in the great western forum. Sound was perfect, no lines, great staff. Parking was ok, getting out want too bad.",Scott D
50,Gwen,Great concert!!!😳 Love seeing shows here the sound and facilities are excellent. In and out very easy as well. Can't wait to come back,SoCalSydney1362
30,Oh Forum How I used to Love Thee,"Okay... where to start...My latest visit to The Forum was Saturday night to see the Dixie Chicks. Nice girlie crowd very well behaved.., but that means the ladies room is always going to have a looooonng line.Speaking of the bathrooms ...our bowl seats were on the left side. The bathrooms are down a flight and a half of stairs which makes them on the floor level. I'm imaging pipes running all along the floor under the floor chairs. There we are together waiting on the stairs to go to the bathroom....Old ladies, pregnant ladies, kids. Then when you get to the toilets you see women coming in the exit stairs and heading right into the toilet. I actually saw a girl fight over cutting in line..what's updated in the bathrooms...the toilet paper holder?!?As I enter the row my shoe comes off. I look down and the floor has some goo on it and my Christian Lou is stuck in the goo. Can't they clean the floor before the show? So far it's like I'm visiting my old boyfriend's craphole apartment, but the bathroom was closer.Before the show we head to the concession stand. BEWARE... beverages in cans or plastic bottles are poured into a big cup without ice with a top and a straw. Is this elementary school? Oh and don't get the popcorn you will have a new set of kernel teeth.Ahhh...the show is about to start. I love the Dixie Chicks and all they stand for. They could be playing on a garbage dump and I would still love listening to them. But that sound...come on Forum what the heck. Too loud guitars can't hear the voices, one band member's guitar was super loud and you can't hear any singing. The sound was off.Still it's music and you can always have fun no matter what the venue. Don't plan on sitting in your seat if you measure butt to knee anymore than 23.5 inches sitting in the seat because your knees will be jammed into the seat in front of you and I mean jammed like a sardine.There is a bright spot. If you are a VIP or on the floor there is a super bar, super food and nice bathrooms. Plus, you just walk on the same level, you know the one with all those pipes underneath to all your concessions and toilets.Its nice when a venue is round. Parking is easy and getting out of the parking lot is fast and easy. THAT makes me want to go back for some more bathroom torture or at least pick a concert where I will be standing.",Bunnie T
40,Blink 182 at the forum,"It has the best acoustigs, the seats are nice, it is a great place for a good timeThe VIP experience is highly recomended",Pao Allen
40,Great venue but the sound system needed help....,"We enjoyed a concert at The Forum - Santana and Journey. It was a great venue, our seats were comfortable and we had an excellent view of the stage. The sound system was not up to par with the 2 groups performance.",GDSPB
10,Be careful at the Forum - Security will not help you,"I attended the Blink 182 Concert on Friday with my daughter.When we first arrived there were people sitting in our seats. I asked them nicely to move and showed them our tickets and they argued with us and refused to move. I went to flag down an usher who did absolutely nothing. I also told security who just told me to tell an usher. So my daughter and I walked around a little bit, bought food and t-shirts and just sat in closer seats until later in the evening when the girls moved so we can sit in our assigned seats.Later in the evening my daughter had to use the restroom so we move from our seats and a group of 3 guys and a girl were blocking the aisle way. My daughter tapped on the girls shoulder and asked her to move so we could get by and didn't move. I tapped on her shoulder, she was intoxicated so was the entire group she was with. They refused to move so I told her to move. The intoxicated man then pushed my daughter who is a minor!I yelled at him, ""You just assaulted a minor!"" He didn't care he was drunk.When I went to tell security they said, ""There was nothing they could do about it""Really? The code of conduct says,"" -Guests shall refrain from using foul/offensive language, fighting, obscene gestures, throwing objects and engaging in other behavior detrimental to the experience of other Guests.-Guests shall not block the aisles.-Guests who consume alcoholic beverages shall do so in a responsible manner.""We didn't even get to see the rest of the show because these drunk idiots were at the end of our aisle and we couldn't get back to our seats.What was supposed to be a great night with my daughter ended up turning into a disaster. Thanks Forum for a horrible evening and a waste of $150",MrsBrandt
50,Perfect Venue For Concerts,"Great venue for concerts, I went to see Drake Summer Sixteen Tour a few days ago. The place was packed, and the energy was amazing. The staff was always friendly and helpful. Parking was easy upon arrival, and huge letter banners helped you locate your car after the concert was over- which is very helpful. Leaving the venue was easy, most places you'll have to wait hours to leave. The way the venue is located there are different exit points which a staff member helps guide. Overall, great experience, they did have food, non-alcoholic beverages, and liquor as well.",caliatl83

50,Fabulous Forum is back,"What a great job done on the remodel. My family really enjoys attending events at the Forum. Traffic is a bit of a pain however, the city of Inglewood is doing a really good job with it.",RAndersonIII
10,The Not so Fabulous Forum,"Went to the Forum for the first time after living in LA for years to see Journey and Santana. It was the worst sound I ever heard at any major concert. Vocals were often unintelligible and there was an intermittent feedback type buzz or speaker overload. The food there is mediocre and overpriced and you have to wait in incredibly long lines for it. The parking at the forum is very limited and expensive, $25-40. They run a shuttle from remote parking lots. Overall not a venue I will frequent.I was very disappointed.",Wingfut
30,"Loved the music, but venue not so much","Went to hear three bands in a concert at the Forum. First time there since they renovated it. The bands were great, but the sound was not very good. Don't know if it was the speaker system or the guy mixing the music, but it didn't sound good. The seats are horrible. The space between rows was so short that your knees were up against the seat in front of you. The only way to avoid that was to sit sideways but that was uncomfortable and not good on your back. A three hour concert was very uncomfortable. Thank god the bands were great!!The positives are that there was plenty of variety of food and drink stands. And they have some outside sitting. There are plenty of venues in LA all with seating much more comfortable than the forum. Will only go back if there's a performer I just have to see that isn't playing anywhere else in LA.",berniek1949

50,Slipknot and Marilyn Manson,"The show was great, the moshpit was totally insane, the venue itself was not bad, staff was professional and mostly nice. There was a heavily intoxicated (with weird drugs) huge dude next to us who started annoying and pushing everyone, we spoke to staff and they responded and escorted him out immediately.",Omar A
40,People watching place,Went to a concert. Be aware camera policies have changed and there was no info on it before the show. Had a great philly cheesesteak sandwich there. Surprised. Bathrooms are staffed and they had to shoo a guy out of there during the show. Sears are comfy and not a bad seat in the house really. Sound was not as good as usually is. There was alot of room on the floor where GA pit was lending to the loss of sound quality.,ballerina501
20,Great venue but horrible security who take their jobs WAAAYYY too seriously,"We love the Forum but this time we were mortified by the attitude of security who pretty much ruined our show as they constantly harassed people in their seats by demanding their ticket stubs and being aggressive. I totally understand keeping the isles clear and all that safety stuff but these dudes were looking for trouble. I've never seen security interrupt someones show while they're in their seats by demanding proof/their ticket stub. These guys were some of the worst ""security"" guards I've ever seen and I've been to literally hundreds of shows/concerts. Shame on the Forum security for thinking they are cops or something and that they have the right to treat paying customers the way they did. We will never return to the Forum again, you can have your ""tough guys"" and your biblical traffic.",jamcruiser
50,Really Great Staff and Amazing Sound,"Just saw Phish at the Forum and I wanted to say that the staff was just wonderful. Everyone was so friendly! We went to get our floor space wristbands at 12pm and were greeted by some of the nicest people I've ever met a venue. Then they continued to be wonderful by giving us clear directions, prescreening people so the lines moved faster, keeping us corralled efficiently and with a smile. I was very impressed because a Phish crowd can be unruly and tire out most venue staff, but the Forum staff was smiling at us even as we left the building after the show. Thanks you, Forum Staff, for making us feel welcome.",Elisa A
50,Pit Bull concert,We had so much fun danced and had a good drink! People had a good time it all went well with out a hitch. So far enjoyable every time we attended concert last time we were there in February we saw Black Sabbath and had a grand time!,spfeismom
40,A comedian and a concert,"We just saw Louis CK here on Monday night. It was my first time being here for a comedian. I've been here at least 4 other times but it was for a concert. The set up is somewhat the same. I've only ever had floor seats here. For the concert (Madonna) floor seats are great as everyone is standing the whole time so the actual seat isnt an issue. For Louis, floor seats weren't ideal in my opinion. The seats on the floor are the old school folding chairs, very narrow and since both our shoulders are pretty broad this made for an uncomfortable night of just sitting. We were to the left of the stage and so had to angle our bodies to the right. Thankfully, Louis was hillarious so it made it worth it. But I did notice that the above us had basically the same view and maybe better as those seats face into the stage. Those seats are also more like theater seats so there are arm rests separating you from the next person. For something like this, I would've preferred not to be on the floor unless I was dead center and in the first few rows (we were in the 8th row). The great thing though about floor seats are that the bathrooms never seem as busy and the bars arent as busy. I notice this every time. Its almost worth paying more for each event just for these reasons.Tip: we ubered there and had the driver drop us off like a block away so that she wouldnt get caught up in the traffic and it was such a short walk thereafter. I know for the concert they had uber set up in a lot across the street so it was a lot easier. But this time they had cabs in the lot and the uber drivers had to drive up to another section. This was very poorly organized. There were masses of people just standing around waiting for their uber. Luckily I requested my uber as we left our seats. It took the driver about 10-15 minutes to get there. But he did go to the section where we all were so that wasnt an issue, but i could see that had we waited longer, it would've been a complete nightmare.",B N
50,An A+ venue for a concert,I have gone twice in the last year and each time I have come away impressed with the acoustics and sight lines.,USCarlos
40,My day to see Louis C. K.,"It was a wonderful night started by a rushed understanding. I had to fly like a comet because Ticketmaster was being confusing with the orders. My rushed entrance to the parking lot was only because I didn't want my friend Maron to be distressed, waiting for my imminent arrival at Dulan's. Also, partial extinguishment of worry was deleted as I was encountered by a pretty darling of a parking attendant whom was able to charge my debit card instead of making me get cash in effective. How lovely of her! I parked in BB and met Maron who was parked in CC, as we marvelled at the size of The Forum. Promo stops from the sponsors and beer corners dotted the outdoors as my former coworker and I updated each other on ""what's new"" in each other's lives. A fellow comic himself, he worked register at this restaurant, Mendocino Farms, in Westlake Village, my birth-town. As we were nearly about to give up, a stand inside was selling Pink's Hot Dogs. Minus any sense or remorse, I got myself a $15 Chili Cheese Dog and scarfed it down in true blue Sonic-style. From cute chicks to plenty of young children, there was a mötley of people around. The show was enjoyable but I wish it wasn't so cold because I kept seeping in and out of sleep. But Louie's jokes about death, having heard of things, how to go for the best gays and abortions vs. pooping really were hilarious. Although at a certain moment, I felt like he was doing various voices of personalities in his set. Something I would've never expected out of him since ""Oh My God,"" when he admitted that he found it hard to do ""voices."" But that was three years ago. Overall, he won the crowd over tremendously and performed terrifically. Jolly good show indeed.",Danny Archila
50,Was at the Forum for UFC199,"The Forum in Inglewood is awesome. It's amazing that it is a pretty old building, but still kept in great shape. The awesome history of great events here is pretty cool. We went to UFC199 here, and even though the seats were pretty high, we had a great view. There really isnt a bad seat in the house. I love the way the Forum is setup and easy to get around and to your seats. The vending is great as well...lots of great food and even full bars. This is a great place to see any event.",Mike G
40,Great accoustics,Have been here a few times since the reopening and it is still a great place to go to see a concert. Parking is not a huge issue and with the screens most seats are pretty good.,Jason F
50,BAD COMPANY AND JOE WALSH,"Having not been to the Forum since the 1980's we went to see Bad Company and Joe Walsh on the 20th of May. I must say Paul Rodgers sounded like he was 25 again the band put on a super show, the forum was updated in 2013 and what a great venue to see a concert or just about anything else, Joe Walsh did a great tribute to fellow Eagle Glenn Fry, a great night and Ringo Starr showed up as a guest with Joe great night had by all. If you can catch the show as they tour the country you will be glad you did.",tazman1953
40,Beautiful venue,"Staff very friendly. Newly renovated. Sound is a little too loud up front...sound up in the nosebleeder seats is just right. Chicken sandwich was delicious! Overall, food is a little expensive...make sure you eat before or after the event if you're on a budget. I would definitely return!",Christina C
40,Still a great venue,"I was around to see this place being built in the 1960s. Even now it brings back such great memories. Parking is ample, but crowded - pretty typical. The building remains in good repair and it still feels secure. Nice, new paint job, too. It seems small when compared to the mega arenas, but I kind of like the smaller, intimate feel of The Forum. Enjoy your event!",mercurysqueen
30,Expansive parking,"The Venue: This venue seems a little bit outdated. The seats are small and not much leg room. Not cup holder in front the seat, it is challenging to sing & dance with Rihanna while still holding your drink in your hand.They sell snacks and drinks outside the auditorium and of course inside as well. So the lines aren't that bad. They also sell concert merchandise.The sound system isn't the best. Other venues like Staples Center, Microsoft Theater & etc have better quality sound system.The Service: Many staffs are on duty. They are helpful when you need direction to your seats.The Parking: $25 for Rihanna's concert. Nearby residential area has signs stating ""No event parking"".",ILoveFoodComa
50,Awesome concert Venue,"Attended recent concert at this venue. Everything was so well organised! Getting there was easy, plenty of places to park for those driving(or in our case there was a close drop off point from a taxi), staff providing street crossing points kept the flow of traffic and patrons moving well, and the gate staff were friendly and efficient - no annoying lines!There was plenty of snack/drink places around the venue and staff on hand everywhere to help you find your way. The venue itself is great for music concerts - the sound and visibility excellent. I would not hesitate to go to this venue again. When it came time to leave it was easy, a taxi rank was organised and again lots of staff on hand to see all patrons safely and quickly away home.",Jan C
40,Not a bad place for a concert!,"I was very weary going there after having read the previous reviews complaining about the parking. I actually had no issue at all, other than the $25 parking fee, but oh well... We got into the lot right away and were immediately directed to a parking space. The lot was not far from the entrance to the Forum.Once inside, it was pretty cool. We saw Iron Maiden's The Book of Souls tour. The acoustics in there were great and Maiden sounded awesome. We were in Section 106, row 6, with a pretty good view.Yes, the beer is ridiculously expensive. It was $13 for a 16oz and $26 for a 24oz. Needless to say, I spent about $80 on myself alone. In any case, I'd definitely attend another concert there if given the opportunity.",Karras13
50,The Fabulous Forum!,"I caught Iron Maiden at the Forum for both shows (April 15th and 16th). I've never been to the Forum before, but I can certainly attest to the fact that it is, indeed, Fabulous! First of all, the Forum is ridiculously easy to get to. It was about 5-10 minutes away from our LAX airport hotel. Secondly, parking was extremely easy to deal with and VERY reasonable. I paid $40 for preferred parking and it was totally worth it. The Forum had staff directing traffic into the arena before the show and afterwards, too. We were able to leave the Forum and get back out on to Manchester in under 5 minutes. Third, this venue absolutely knows how to set up merchandise tables. Not only that, but also the people working those tables were experienced, knowledgeable and friendly. I caught Iron Maiden on their opening night at the BB&T Center in Fort Lauderdale, FL and it was awful. The folks at the BB&T should take a lesson from the staff at the Forum. Everything went smoothy with the concert. The doors were opened a little before the advertised time of 6:30. The merchandise tables were easily accessible both outside and inside the arena. The staff working the tables were efficient and friendly. The staff working the concessions stands inside were also equally friendly. Of course, the prices for concessions are the usual prices and that's to be expected, but the people working this venue were amazing - both nights and that tells me that it wasn't just a fluke on the first night. Even the bathrooms were clean throughout the show. One final comment, on the first night, we had seats in what I believe are called the Senate Seats - these were in 3rd row in Lower Bowl Section 126. We had bigger seats, attendants that would take orders (so we didn't have to leave to get anything) and we had access to the the Chase area with private bathrooms. I would say that even though those seats were expensive (we had them for the Friday night concert), they are totally worth it. All in all, having never been to the Forum or even LA for that matter, I can say that I highly recommend seeing a concert at this venue. The Fabulous Forum truly lives up to its name in every sense of the word!",irunnoft
50,Great place for a concert.,I have been going to concerts here for twenty years. They have remodeled some since then. Always have great experiences here. We had a bartender this time named Curtis. He was amazing and funny as can be. Really Made us feel special. T shirts for the concert seem to get more pricey everytime we go and I don't think the artist gets any cut from the monies made from merchandise sold. Overall...great place.,Marcieyoutz
40,David Gilmore,Saw David Gilmore at the Forum 3/27/16. Great show. Floor seat section D. Rows between seats were too close together. Difficult time walking to your seat. Staff was very helpful and there were plenty of them to help show you around. Parking staff kept things moving before and after the show. Not a bad experience.,cnanrw
50,History,"What can I say, the Fabulous Forum!!!! Lakers when Showtime ruled the NBA!! When the Triple Crown Line of the LA Kings were the scourge of the NHL!! Gretzky came to town and made history! Neil Diamond brought down the house on New Years Eve!! Still one of finest venues for sports and entertainment in USA! If your in LA, must see!",Thomas P
20,The Fabulous New Forum was a disappointment,"We came in on the landing which was very pretty, but we had to walk down a vast amount of steps to get to our seats. They claim they had no elevators, the seat rows were so uncomfortable we all had to sit side wards and I'm tall but they are all short. They did not have projection screens so if you had an average seat you really couldn't really see the performers. Maze and Patti LaBelle. I understand they do have screen now or had them but didn't use them at that particular performance (artist decision??). Parking $25.00. It was a uncomfortable evening. I'm a row A - H person, we went for mid range that night and had to pay the price. I enjoyed Forum better prior to remodel, again, maybe it was just our seats row K. I don't plan on attending another event at the Forum The Forum is a I don't care who is performing, not that serious. I rather drive to OC and be comfortable. I what's there September, '14",Msarrayah
50,Family and Friends,"So we stayed at the Hollywood Inn Express, which is a short drive from the forum and we took an uber there so we wouldn't have to worry about driving. There's tons of parking and everyone there was so nice and friendly. Was easy to talk to others and the staff there was very helpful. We went there for the I Heart 80s Concert. That concert was amazing, lots of seating and we were just above the floor seating and the music was rocking. We all had a great time there and can't wait to come back.",AlexHealey94
50,A comfortable and soundworthy the concert venue,"Last night, we saw the I heart radio 80s rock concert at the forum in Inglewood. I was very pleased with the sound quality and the acoustics. The concert was amazing and I found that overall it was easy to find our seats and the seats were generally comfortable, although it would be nice to have a little more legroom as a 6 foot four man. It was very clean and the employees that work there were friendly. I didn't buy any food or drinks but they both looked sort of expensive. I would return to this venue, even though I don't much like concerts but I did enjoy my experience at the forum.",Jon M
50,The Fabulous Forum Inglewood,Wow! what a great place. After its purchase by Madison Square Gardens it has come alive once again. My wife and I have enjoyed many events at this place over the years and are very happy to see it back in service. An excellent entertainment venue and events.,RichardO70
40,Iconic venue,"I went to the sold out Black Sabbath concert on their final the end tour. I was surprised that traffic around the Forum was really not too bad during the event. I've seen traffic around other venue that were far worst. There is more than enough parking on site if you wanna pay the 20$. On the other hand, it wasn't hard to find street side parking only about 4 or 5 blocks on the outskirts of the venue. T-shirt hawkers were mostly on manchester blvd selling shirts for 10$. The venue itself is set up pretty well for the amount of seats.",satobt
40,The Forum is back & better than ever!,"I was a huge fan of the Forum as a concert venue many, many years ago. Since returning to the Forum when the Eagles re-opened it two years ago, I've had the pleasure of attending several concerts there and it is once again my favorite concert venue. Most recently I attended the Dead & Co tour and had a blast. For this concert, we had floor seats, but I've also had seats in both the upper & lower bowl. There truly isn't a bad seat in the house. Where Staples turns prime seating over to three levels of private boxes, at the Forum, you get to be that much closer to the stage. In the two years since re-opening, they've worked out most of the kinks with the food, though lines are usually too long in the upper and lower bowl. Restrooms are clean and if you aren't averse to using the nice portables outside, plentiful.",Heather P
20,A great place for events,Old and run down and the security stinks. It needs to be paid attention to cause of all the revenue it brings to the City and community. It is a traffic nightmare and busy all of the time but I must admit the venues that are available are attractive.,george shala
40,Great Remodeling,"I went to a concert in Spanish and I really liked the newly remodel Forum. It's round so it can be confusing to get in and get out but there are plenty of workers ready to guide you, the problem was when I got out, since it's round I had no idea where I had parked my car, everywhere I looked, looked the same! It took me a while to find it, so pay attention where you park it, maybe take a picture with your cell phone so you don't forget. The sound was amazing! I got floor tickets, the problem with that is that the floor it's flat and you will always have people taller than you in front that will block your view. I did not buy any food or drinks there so I don't know the quality of their snack bars, I did purchase a water bottle for 5.00 dollars! but they come sell them on the floor so that was a plus, at least I didn't have to leave my seat and fight the crowd to buy a water bottle. Overall I was very happy with everything. I also got parking pretty close to the door, that would have been awesome if I had remembered where I parked. I would go to another concert there in a heartbeat.",Kiararamirez
30,"Great Show, Horrible Experience w/Security","I attended the NYE Dead & Company concerts here. It was my first time at The Forum. It was easy to park and easy to leave the parking lot once the show was over.My only complaint is the Security. They were horrible. I had GA tickets for the first show and arrived at 4 p.m. to only see a few others ahead of me. I was given a wristband and waited for the time for the doors to open. I understand the band was late w/sound check so the doors couldn't open on time (this happened at some other Dead & Company shows I attended). However, the security was plain rude, threatening to not open the doors at all even when the band was done w/sound check. I understand they were trying to make it easier and faster to get people inside w/patting down and doing bag checks before, but the way we were grouped together and lined up made it hard and nearly impossible which got security in an uproar.They changed it for the second night, but I had a VIP GA ticket so I'm not sure how that went. I thought things would be better, but they weren't. After getting searched and my ticket scanned I was in another line to get into the venue, made it inside when security said we weren't allowed in the GA section. They let some of the VIP people in then stopped everyone else. It was confusing and aggravating b/c the whole point of the VIP ticket was to get early access into the show. Luckily the friends I had made the night before were in the front so I was front row that night as well. It's like Security was prepared at all or knew what was going on. The Forum needs to work on this for future events. I go to a ton of concerts all over the country and have never had that experience before.",kbphotography85
30,"Not a terrible venue, just not a good one.","Not a terrible venue, just not a good one. A bit large for my taste, but then again that is where Arcade Fire play these days - large venues. Aside from the self serving performance from Arcade Fire, I found the Forum layout and concessions set up is not the best design, and the same can be said of the acoustics.The most pleasant thing about the Forum for me is the fact that I needed only a $20 Uber to get home that night.",HutchinLA
50,When in Rome,"I was driven up to The Forum to see ""Dead and Company"" and it took my breath away. All I could think of was the Forum in Rome, tumbling down with its wild and feral cats and how majestic was this LAX Forum from hence it got its name, I supposed. As I got out of the truck, low and behold, there was this calico cat there next to a security guard and it was so surreal. The cat was friendly and suspicious at the same time, and I asked the guard who it belonged to. He said, ""The Forum."" So I already knew I was in for a real good time. It was overwhelming inside to me. Too big. I felt gobbled up and like some kind of spectator at a gladiator game. Like I was one of the Christians to be fed to the Lions. But I soon relaxed with an expensive beer and my dead-head friends, most much younger than me but not all. Like the band members. Ha Ha. My seat was way too high up but what do I expect with my champagne tastes on a beer budget. Still, I was overjoyed to see my beloved band play and watch John Mayer do his young thing. He seemed so natural, next to Bob Weir, like it is meant to be. Like Jerry Garcia is smiling down from heaven saying ""Yes, you do that, son, yes..."" So this place is very special to me now. I would drive all the way from Arizona again and do it all over but the next time, I would get a hotel much closer to the venue and have a copilot. There is something sad about the parking lot being so expensive and this should be modified and included in the ticket price. After all, the empty space only shows how huge The Forum really is. Next they will be charging for that smoggy air as well! Hopefully, someone in management will read my review and understand we all aren't able to pay so much to park our cars as when we do, we take away from the view of that spectacular work of architecture protected by a calico feline.",logwoman
50,Beautiful!,"I love the new Forum. I live walking distance. I walk to the Forum to attend events. My last event was the Janet Jackson concert. The floor seats were too close together, however the seating above the floor seats are comfortable. At night the forum lights up with Christmas color. It is a beautiful sight to see. In addition, traffic is well control during concert events.",Marlene J
30,Old school concert venue,"Saw the Janet Jackson concert. Venue was older, but nice. It had more of an intimate feel then the mega sports complexes. The view of the stage was good even from the upper seats. As I understand it, the venue was just updated a few years ago. The acoustics could have been better but that may have been Janet's sound people....don't know.The parking was a nightmare and ridiculously expensive in my opinion ($25); it took us almost 30 minutes to park.",JFair36900
40,so many bathrooms!,"The number and cleanliness of bathrooms is a definte plus at this venure. The parking was very organized, unlike horrible tandem parking of the Hollywood Bowl. The eateries are not sit down restaurants, but more like pernanent stands. The $13 philly steak was actually delish!The seats are pretty comfy, and there are lots of entry points with helpful aisle attendants. I saw Madonna here, and managed to spend $80 on food and drinks waiting for her to show up on stage.",808stays
30,Good venue - there are some bad seats though...,"I agree with what others have said about the remodel. The venue does look modern and is much improved.We saw Madonna there last night, and the only thing I have to add is that for the upper sections (e.g. 227) anything higher than row 10 is NOT GOOD!!! You can see ok because is a relatively small venue, but even that isn't great. Also, with the overhang, the ceiling is low and you really can't hear too well. I wouldn't recommend it - better to watch the concert on TV at home when it comes out on DVD :-)",Regina L
30,Janet Jackson,This is the second time I have been to this venue. I truly enjoy it. The staff had been very helpful helping with my friend who is handicap.,Cindy V
40,Greatly improved,"When we saw Guns & Roses at a Forum in 2011, I told people I would never go to the Forum again due to its decrepit state. Thankfully, its remodel makes it a top notch venue once again. The acoustics have been improved, and the facility is no longer dilapidated. There were plenty of staff in the clean and modernized restrooms. We were shown to our seats, and staff continued to assist patrons the entire evening. The on site parking was efficient and only a few bucks more than the off site parking. Surprisingly, we were out of the parking lot and on the street only a few minutes after the show ended.",wuvhawaii
40,Good acoustics since remodel,The acoustics are better than ever since the remodel. Seating seems a little cramped. The degree/angle of steps are more challenging without any type of handrails.,carefreelady2013
40,"Good concert venue, all seats are pretty decent","Saw Def Leppard, Styx, and Tesla here a few days ago. I think it's a pretty good place to see a concert. We were in the upper level, although the lowest part of the upper level, and we could see just fine. It's small enough that there aren't really bad seats.We sat in the parking lot before the concert having some food, watching the planes fly overhead to land at LAX, and saw the sunset. Really nice night!Parking was super easy, both getting in and out.Someone said pack a weapon for the surrounding areas. I disagree, I mean, you are parked in the Forum parking lot, there are plenty of cops around. So many parts of L.A. are seedy, I'm really not worried about driving a few blocks to the Forum to and from the freeway. I didn't see any gangbangers around. If you grew up in Nebraska, yeah, it might be a little intimidating, but if you grew up in L.A., this is just life in L.A. Has nothing to do with the Forum.",Simple M
50,Old School renewed!,"Smaller than Staples Center or even the Honda Center but so much more intimate I think. Saw the Foo Fighter and we had floor level (standing only). It was great! Dave Grohl is so awesome. Concert was sold out but the crowd was not rowdy or rude. The drinks were great and the bartender wonderful and funny. Easy parking and easy to get out of. Winner, winner......",cloudb310
10,Black paint and dingy carpet does not a Refurbishment make!!,"Forget for a moment that to get to and from the Forum you need to be packing a weapon as its smack in the ghetto, I was still excited to revisit my old stomping ground after 20 years. In the 1990's heyday of Wayne Gretzky glory I used to zip around there like it was my second home - sure it was kitchy, stuck in the mid 60's with floor to ceiling vinyl, orange and yellow everything, and 1 bathroom to service 16k people, but it was fun and it wasn't pretending to be anything other than an old arena.So when I heard that it had undergone a 30 million dollar refurb to bring it back to venue status I was excited to see what they did. I can spare you the trip: They Painted it Black. Literally, a matte black coat of paint on top of the existing stucco - where you can still see the outline of where signage used to hang, and some red carpeting that is already showing disgusting wear. I think it was trying to feel ""intimate"" or ""club like"" - what it feels is dirty dark and disgusting. It saddens me to say it, given that the history of music and sports that have graced it's walls, but it ought to be leveled to the ground and turned into cheap LAX shuttle parking.",Leigth M
40,"The Forum's Back, Baby!","For a years after the Lakers de-camped to their new downtown digs, the Fabulous Forum was anything but. The good news: it's back. As a venue for concerts, or prize fights, the refurbished and newly-tricked-out Forum is the real deal. They've restored the place to its former glory, which somehow just feels right.And if you can swing a pass into the Forum Club after the event, you're in even better shape. Food offerings aren't world-class, but they're passible, and the bartenders somehow manage to find you amidst the throng.Recommended.",SandersMusic

30,"Rush on August 1st, great show, less convinced about the venue","This review is about the venue, as the actual Rush show was amazing as ever. Over from the UK this is my first time at the Forum ( though been to many US venues). Was underwhelmed except for the (important ) acoustics inside which were good and we could hear things clearly and with enough volume. Main problems: invisible staff during the show so that people were frequently standing in aisles to watch and getting in others' way; food queues before the show were very long, we never got anything to eat; taxi line at the end was impossible - good staff at the front trying to summon more cabs but we waited well over an hour for one. Would have driven but had just flown in so had jet lag. Unlike some reviewers I didn't see much variety for food, but may not have seen all outlets. As others have commented, not having an obvious place to put your drink is strange for a newly renovated venue.To reiterate, the actual music experience was very good.",reviewer64Uk
20,Meh...,"I've been to the Forum 3 times in my life. 94 for a WWF house show, 08 for an AC/DC show and 2014 at the newly ""renovated"" Forum. Pros, Great acoustics and almost every seat in the place is perfect, since its a relatively small arena. The remodeling of the lobby, club and outside lounge area are a big plus. The fact that they now take credit and debit transactions when back in 09 they only took cash, also a big plus. CONS Parking is ridiculously expensive. Seats have all been refurbished or replaced BUT they left ZERO leg room and no cup holders, So if you're over 5'5 and purchase a beer here, well... You my friend are s*** out of luck. Biggest con imo though, is the bathrooms. Yes, they've been remodeled so the urinal trough is long gone, yes they've added privacy stalls in the men's area, but what they should've done is add a couple of more bathrooms in the lobby area instead of fixing up the subterranean ones, I don't even think theyre wheelchair accessible.. Also cheaping out and adding port a potties OUTSIDE the arena, and trying to make them look fancy by covering them up with ivy. Big time fail MSG, I do think that the pros outweigh the cons though, especially since they've been able to book lots of great artists since the renovation. PS, If youre smart, youll take the side streets when getting off the freeway, otherwise youll be stuck on Manchester forever.",mcfly1982
40,Great place to see a concert,"We saw Rush there on August 1st. It was an amazing show! But that isn't why I am reviewing the Forum. The sound in the venue was really good. I like how it was laid out. There are many types of food vendors surrounding the venue, and you can get some really good food and go enjoy it in the California sunshine.Getting in and out of the area was easy as well. It didn't seem to have the same horrible bottlenecks that other venues have when thousands of concert goers are leaving.",nohollyonlyzuul
40,Better Than It Used to Be,"Used to come here for concerts in the late 80s and early 90s and always found parking to be a mess and the seats not so comfortable. Returned last night (last night of Rush's R40 tour) as was pleasantly surprised that the parking was much better organized and the seats more comfortable. Still, not in the best of locations, but some things you can't change so easily. Would come to see a concert here again.",Jeremiah G
40,A great place for events and concerts!,"The newly-remodeled Forum is a great place for events and concerts. The place has been completely transformed from a basketball arena to a first-class concert venue. The interior decor and environment have been re-done to make the place look like a gigantic nightclub. The excellent employees are friendly and helpful. The internal sound system is not quite as good as other local venues, but still very adequate. Best of all, parking and traffic control systems are efficient and accessible.",Jonaleen A
50,Great Time!,Parking was easy! $25. Got our tickets randomly upgraded. What a nice surprise! All the seats at this venue are good seats.

50,Incredible Venue!,"Saw U2 at the Forum on 5/31/15. It was absolutely amazing! The food was good, but the lines were quite long. Overall, fantastic acoustics and concert in general. Definitely worth a check out.",Tyler D
50,U2---can have fun at the Forum!,"Went to the Forum for a U2 concert....which was awesome! The Forum is a nice facility that has, from what I understand, recently been redone. Convenient parking, nice facility, & plenty of concessions. The bathrooms were down below two flight of stairs. I am sure they probably have handicap accessible though.",rabbolding
40,Nicely redone,"Was excited to revisit the arena since it has been remodeled. Hadn't been there since it was the home of the Lakers.Parking was easy for us. We came in off of Manchester Blvd. It is expensive. $25. But we were very close to the arena.They check your ticket before you get up to the outside patio level so you are free to move around inside and out before the event. Had plenty of bar areas set up. Outside lounge chairs and cocktail tables. Flat screen TVs. They were playing a hockey playoff game that evening.Inside lobby is carpeted and has a bit of club vibe. Plenty of additional concession stands. You will not have to wait long to get a beer.The bathrooms are down a steep flight of steps. They are functional. They remodeled them as best as they could. There really is no other place they could be in the building. There was several attendants in the woman's room before the show. The line kept moving.Saw U2 play. The sound was great.My advice before paying for any ticket is to research your event. If it is a concert, find out what type of staging and video screens the band uses. The arena is shaped like an oval. There were some bad seats sold for the U2 concert. If you were on the ends, especially if you were high, you would have missed out on much of the show. Some concerts are more than just the music.Hungry after the event? On Manchester Blvd, before you get to the 405 is a Roscoe's. They are open late on the weekends. Chicken and waffles anyone? If you need coffee for the drive home, Randy's donuts is also on Manchester just on the other side of the 405. They are open 24 hours.",clairef246
40,Great venue but nightmare traffic after the show,"Generally speaking the reviews here seem pretty accurate. The venue has been nicely renovated, the bathrooms are crowded if you don't do some exploring to find the empty ones, the stairs are steep but I didn't find the floors to be sticky, the attendants are very friendly and helpful, the parking was $20, the drinks are expensive and the traffic situation after the show was a complete nightmare. We were fortunate enough to have box seats and they came with waiter/waitress service...who knew.",Hokiecoyote

Having seen so many Laker games and other sporting events televised from there through the years, it was a great experience to be able to see it in person. We sat in section 111 in the 11th row, and had a great view of the fight, even though we weren't on the floor. The place is in great shape, and looks good and well-kept both inside and out.",MichiganTed
40,Boxing at the forum,"The forum is a very impressive arena, looks spectacular from the ouside and is very nice on the inside. We taxi'd there and back from hollywood, which was about $50-60 each way, there is a taxi rank outside at the end of the events.The only issue was the queues for the toilets, could definitely do with more urinals in the mens.Also make sure if you are not from the u.s that you take passports for i.d. They served us with our driving licence but then told us as they handed over our drinks that they won't serve us next time with the i.d we had, even though they had just handed us our second beers!!",Pppmacca43
40,the remodel is wonderful and the sound system is off the charts,"Went to the forum to see Fleetwood Mac. Had season tickets to the LA kINGS AND lakersyears ago before they moved to the Staples Center. the venue is great. Seats comfortable and roomy. Lots of resturants and drink areas. Plenty of restrooms. Parking is good. NOw Fleetwood was another story. Not the old Fleetwood, in my opinion.",Michael T
40,"Sound is good in Ingle-hood, but no cup holders makes your drink no fun","I remember going to the forum for the last time 20 years ago and from what I remember some things have changed.They now have an outside terrace area where they sell drinks. Very nice. People are allowed to step outside and get out of the stuffy venue, and you can hear a bit of the music should you have to stand in line during the show. There's even a smoking area as well.The sound in the Forum is pretty good when comparing to other arena concert venues. I've been back twice and have sat in ""GOOD"" seats in the 100 side section and what some would consider not so good seats and surprisingly I was happy in the 200 side section.What is quite disappointing with such a huge renovation there are no cup holders at your seat. You have to put your drink under your seat and HOPE when you stand to dance or let someone pass by your drink won't get knocked over.The absolute worst would be the restrooms. You have to walk downstairs to get to them and when you're done you have to walk back up them. My first concert at the forum was 27 year's ago and yes the stairs were there then. I'm not even sure what they do for disabled patrons, never noticed. Too much potential for people to trip and fall down the stairs trying to simply use the restroom. Let's not forget most people will drink at these events. It's really the pits. Remember you're not going for the bathrooms. I'd love for this to be an ""excellent"" venue however, I need cup holders and easy to get to restrooms.",lowbuxlux
30,Horrible Restrooms!!!!,"They (MSG) spent a gazillion dollars fixing it up. Sound is pretty good. Not sure they got their money's worth! Sitting in the rafters is pretty creepy!! (Yep! I know. My fault for not wanting to pay a gazillion dollars for concert tickets! But who cares anymore?! My eyes are so bad that unless I'm in the front row, I can't see anything anyway except for on the screen, not to mention, that at our age, the people we go to see, you wouldn't want to see up close anyway!!). Seats are tiny and we're not big people!! God help you if you are plus-size!! Drinks are a total ripoff! AND, the restrooms are scary creepy! They're so far underground (way down a flight of stairs) that you can feel the heat from the Earth's Core!! Avoid at all costs!!",DocSnarky
40,Epicenter concert,"I went to the Epicenter concert. It started at 5:30. I got there around 5. $25 for general parking, $40 for premium parking. There was also other places that were charging $20 for parking. I just did the general parking, which was only a couple rows from the building. They have a security check before you get your ticket scanned and let in. You have to empty out your pockets and some people were lifting up the bottom of their pants. You have to open your bags or purses if you bring any and they look inside. Then once given the okay, you go up to the next people and get your ticket scanned. Didn't take very long. Cigarettes and lighters are allowed, although smoking is not allowed inside. There is however the outside perimeter of the forum that you are allowed to go and smoke at in the special designated areas. As long as you don't go past the people that are scanning tickets, you are good. They have couches and seats to sit in and smoke. There are bars outside selling beer and hard alcohol and soda along with a couple places that cook. One sold stir fry. I got a vegetable and noodle stir fry with teriyaki and chili sauce, no meat, so it was vegan. It normally comes with steak or chicken. It was $12. If you buy a soda from the fountain, they only have one size, no refills, but they will give you a refill of ice, $6.50. I didn't notice any other vegan food there besides that stir fry at the grill outside. They have sandwiches and salads prepackaged with chicken and an asian dressing. Pink's hot dogs, one with chili I think and then a plain one. They have stuff to put on them. The plain hot dog was 6.50. They have the boxes of candy that you can buy at Target for a dollar for, $4 there. Sour patch kids, m&m's and reeses pieces. They sold popcornapolis popcorn and another little stand sold regular popcorn. They also have some type of ice cream sandwich, bags of chips, pretzels. Didn't see any cotton candy though. Beer prices range from $10-$13. You are not allowed to bring any food or drinks in. The bathroom I used was down a flight of stairs. Seemed to be pretty well kept up all night. Staff there were pleasant. Getting out of the parking lot after wasn't too bad.",Phluffie

50,Great Venue,"The seats are comfortable, and the venue is small enough that every seat is a good seat. Restroom facilities are plentiful enough that no long lines for the restroom formed. Parking and concessions are close to seating area. The staff were all friendly and professional. Even the wine served at the bar was above average. Exiting the parking lot after the event was very easy. The only down-side of this venue is the neighborhood it's in; if you want restaurants and lodging associated with your event, I recommend finding a place to eat and spend the night in Manhattan Beach, which is just 15 minutes away.",James G
40,Nice job in Re-inventing the old Barn in Inglewood,"Made my first trip back to the erstwhile ""Fabulous Forum"" since the night the Ducks and Kings played the last hockey game in the storied venue. Was pleasantly surprised by the changes made to make the Forum a concert venue. Use of the outside promenade area as an outdoor food and drink court is a great idea as the concourses inside the arena are quite small and cramped. As one would expect, plenty of stands serving alcoholic beverages and limited foodstuffs but that's what one looks for at a concert event. Concert hall configuration very intimate compared to the cavernous Staples Center. Parking is still somewhat of an adventure after the show as all exits seem to dump onto Prairie Ave going south toward Century Blvd or the 105 freeway. Forum does seem to get it's share of top performers though - saw Bob Seger there in his only performance in the LA area. Would not hesitate if another top group or individual was to perform there.",Greg W

50,Fabulous is the word!,"The Forum is back better than ever! The hall is very clean considering the amount of people that use the walkways. The photo murals are very cool.

The restrooms are clean and the staff is helpful and friendly. This is my go to for concerts. The sound quality is awesome!",Troy M
30,OK...,"We came here to see a concert on a rainy Saturday night. Traffic was slow going into the parking lot and there were two lots... $20.00 and $25.00. The $25.00 lot was a closer walk, but we chose the $20.00 lot which wasn't too bad of a walk even with the rain.Security do check bags before your tickets get scanned and I had a bottled water with me and they didn't say anything which was great because I hate spending $4 or $5 on one bottled water.We sat in section 205 and it was ok. The floor was wet with spilled beer which was from the people sitting behind us. There was very little leg room and no cup holders. We witnessed a person falling on his bum twice as he was going down the stairs so be careful and hold on to the railing.Not sure if it was the section we were in, but the sound wasn't that great.",lvgrl2014
50,The Fabulous Forum is Back!,"I went to the Foo Fighters Concert on January 10, 2015 and I haven't been to the Forum since it was remodeled. They did a Great Job! The interior remodel was impressive. The carpeting is cool, the pictures on the walls show concerts of the past which bring back great memories. Even though parking was $25.00 it was worth it, we parked very close to walking in. The beverages are the standard price as anywhere, $10 to $13 for drinks.The one thing that they missed on was drink holders for the seats. This would help tremendously. The Foo Fighters in the round was amazing, all of the seats, all the way to the top are good to see the show. All of the attendants were polite,helpful and welcoming, including the parking attendants. I was hesitant about going back to the Forum, but I would highly recommend it as one of the best venues to see a concert.",Joseph G
30,Fleetwood Mac at the Forum,Parking went smooth although parking is ridiculously over priced and not well organized. If you get a seat in the red section of their map you can't go wrong. Orchestra seating isn't worth the price because everyone stands in order to see the stage. Yellow seating section is the nosebleed section and I wouldn't recommend it. Overall this old venue was functional. Parking was expensive and disorganized but exiting the parking lot was a breeze.,Gabby92399
50,Excellent Rebirth of The Fabulous Forum,"Madison Square Garden Group bought the Forum and put tons of $$ into the refurbishment and it shows. We attended the Fleetwood Mac concert and had floor seats. 3/4 of the floor is at floor level. Our seats (Section 3) were elevated slightly above the floor. All floor seats were of the folding variety with cushion seats and backs. I didn't go to the upper levels, but it did appear that their cushioning was a bit better. But, the cushions didn't impact the excitement of the concert. There were a number of LED screens behind and above the band displaying videos in tune with the music. The sound was great and the view of the stage was unobstructed. In fact there are not any pillars to obstruct views from any seat. If you have floor seats, you will want to park on the north side of the Forum as there is a separate entrance for you. There is prefered parking for $40 (regular parking was $25). We arrived about 2 hours before the concert and parked as close or closer than preferred parking would have been. I would not hesitate attending other concerts here.",MUG318CA
50,"Wonderful to have the Fourm back---THE best place for a concert, hands down","OK, we saw Fleetwood Mac on Dec 6. What everyone says about the sound system and acoustics is correct: the sound is loud, but crystal clear; no distortion or ear problems at all (except for the chick screaming behind us!! :-) )It is TRUE that parking is easy in and relatively easy out. We drove from the city of Orange. Take the 105 to Prarie and and head north; pay $25 for parking--fast and easy (we arrived about 45 minutes early).It is TRUE that the staff, from ticket-takers, to bartenders to ushers are hands down the friendliest and most helpful group you will ever come across--amazing and embracing. I'm an old white guy in my 60's and these people were WONDERFUL to our group. Love you guys!! Keep it up!!Of course Fleetwood Mac was beyond expectations and if you have to mortgage your house to buy tickets, do it! No regrets! :-)Regarding crowded bathrooms: Have you ever been ANYWHERE when 17,000 people decide it's a good time to take a pee and you found empty bathrooms??? Hey, if you don't want to wait in line, TIME your pees accordingly!! :-)[tip--each bathroom has two entrances. Often one entrance has a line and the other does not...think about it and figure it out...look around]Hope you all enjoy. It's great to have the Forum back and having great concerts. Last time I was there was probably the Who's Quadraphenia concert in '73",mamitch52
40,A great night of music,"This was my first trip back to the Forum since watching the Lakers play here in 1992 right after the riots. All I can say is WOW! What a great job of turning this into a first class concert venue.Went to see Fleetwood Mac here 12/6/14 and had a great experience. Parking was easy,yet pricy at $25 general-$40.00 for preferred which I paid for. Lot's of staff every where in the lot and around the complex. We had a short walk to the entrance to the ground level seating area.My only complaint of the layout is that you have to walk down 3 flights of stairs to get to the ground level seating, on the way in not to bad , but upon leaving it is a little more challenging.The staff was friendly and helpful. I saw them help many people find their seats, Help the handicapped folks and more. Security was there, but not too ""there"" which is good.The seats are new and comfortable. We sat in row 5 on the ground level and could almost touch the stage. Sound and light where very good. The rest of the venue is clean and updated. I will echo some other reviewers comments regarding the bathrooms, in that they could us more and larger ones. The drink lines went fast and the drinks where great.We had a great experience and look forward to returning to the Forum to listen to some more great music.",Muykido
40,Fleetwood Mac Concert Rocked,"The drive was fine. Getting in was easy. Pay $25 for general parking and $40 for preferred. We opted for $25 but they could use parking signs. We were completely turned around after the show but the cars leaving was such a cluster mess we were in no hurry. Our floor seats were fine but we stood the entire time. If you are short this is not your space. I would opt for higher seating next time. I am tall and still had to dodge heads. Had three drinks spilled on me. I paid $14 for a red wine in an airplane cup. The section for concessions for the floor seats has this low ceiling which is claustrophobic when it gets crowded and there is NO traffic flow before the show. There are fun 10' murals of performers great for selfie taking. Great video projections screens and the LED backdrop for the show was amazing. The staff was friendly and ran the show fairly well. There's food like hotdogs, nachos, etc. Bought a Tshirt towards the end when there was no line and was able to check the alignment of the art. Many times the machine spits then out and the art is off center. Drives me crazy. Especially for $40. Bathrooms are small and narrow. Again, there's options around the area for parking but if you chose the lot don't be in any hurry leaving. Also, check the set list online for knowledge of what's what when seeing a concert.",iamstevenmichael
50,Excellent,Easy access on and off freeway. Many local hotels and motels to choose from. Inexpensive taxi fare to and the Forum.,Martha M
40,Nice concert venue,I was here for the iHeartRadio Latin Fiesta. The Forum has been updated and reopened. The seating was good. The staff was efficient and friendly. The parking lot and their staff well organized. I used the VIP parking ($40 instead of $25) and it made it much easier to leave after the concert. Plus a shorter walk into the arena.,M T
50,Fleetwood Mac Concert,My first time at the Forum and it was amazing. We went for the Fleetwood Mac concert and it was fantastic!!! The parking was easy and we got in and out so fast. Faster than we thought possible. We walked in and our seats were right there. The food and drinks a little pricey but hey you only live once. This was a present for my husband and it enjoyed it!!! It is a great place for a concert and we will go back if it someone we really want to see.,Debbie L
50,Fleetwood Mac concert,"This was my first visit to the Forum. I traveled from MST and it was worth the visit. Fleetwood Mac was excellent - welcome back Christine. Great sound system. Since I was from out of town I took a taxi to the venue. The taxi line following the concert was very quick. In fact all lines were quick (beer, merchandise, admission). My only complaint was the ladies bathroom line and the many steep stairs to get down to the bathroom.",alison h
50,FLEETWOOD MAC CONCERT GREAT VENUE,The venue itself is easy to get into now if you have a car good luck we took a taxi The tait stands were fast. Inside the floor seats were comfortable. Now the $12.00 drink at the bar was a bit weak though. The staff help are always cleaning love that. For the size of the place it is great for a concert.,10356
50,"Incredible night, never forgotten","Ok it was Fleetwood Mac we were seeing so the night was always going to be amazing. The venue is totally organised from the parking to the toilets. Everything is designed to get you through the queues quickly. The staff are obviously well trained and very helpful. The merchandise was cheaper than in UK. Just be aware some options of T's are different outside near the bars than inside. However, the sales staff were happy to let us swop, (more than once!). The food inside is the usual burgers, hot dogs etc and very tasty and not a rip off price. A huge burger and fries $10 for example. My daughter is 28 and wanted a beer so of course needed to show ID. Just be aware that they were not going to accept a UK driving licence as ID. It had been used everywhere else so we asked for manager as she made an exception. All done very nicely too. The stadium is big but I've been in bigger so it felt perfect for a concert as you could actually see the band on stage rather than rely on screens. The sound quality was excellent. Obviously you would expect traffic to be slow leaving the concert. As a guide, it took us an hour to get back to The Mondrian on Sunset Boulevard.",bn1
20,Disappointed with many things,"I've been to many concerts in my life in many countries and cities.This disappointed me in basic items like:- bathrooms - huge escalator to get there- seats - small , no place holders for drinks, no thought about illumination being on the way of top floor guests- bad infrastructure to leave a full arena. It was a mess! Cars going all over.- sound quality, pfff, that is far far far far far from what i consider almost perfect at the staples- the concessions are mainly for drink! Guys.. There's people who expect to eat there. We need options !!!My reason not being the artist, i'd reconsider going.Won't discuss pricing as this is probably the artist's rates",ragdias
50,The Forum is fabulous again!,"We saw The Eagles there on the night of the grand re-opening and just saw Slayer there more recently. The Forum has been totally renovated as well as the entire parking lot. It is nice to see it in all its former glory. On our last concert there, we were invited to the Chase Lounge before the show. It was really nice and new. We were given all you can eat food, sodas, candy and free V.I.P. parking. In fact, we practically had the whole lounge to ourselves! From the lounge we had special access to our seats and they were good ones. The seating and acoustics are really good in all areas of the arena. The staff is also very friendly and professional. I like the fact that The Forum is now designated as an all concert venue. No sharing with sporting events! Yes! They have been booking some great bands during the year and I definitely would not hesitate attending many more concerts at this venue. Check it out!",Michael R
50,Welcome Back,"MSG has returned the Forum to it's former glory!! New seats, new vendors, great sound, everything first class all the way. In my opinion a much nicer place to see a concert than the Staples Center. Still a pain to get out of the parking lot, but worth it. Highly recommended!!",Charles M
40,NICE RENOVATIONS!!!!!,Saw Pepe Aguilar. Acoustics were good. Lines for concessions were not too long. Security visibly present. Seat comfortable. Bussed it to the concert and cabbed it back to hotel. Area wasnt too bad,oneeddy1
50,Great Venue for Large Concerts,"The forum was recently renovated and remodeled. It's a great improvement over its previous condition. We saw Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers with Steve Winwood. It was incredible!! Glad we didn't miss this event. Beautiful staging and lighting perfectly synchronized with the music, twinkling star lights on the ceiling used for effect during certain numbers. Light show projections on fluid moving drapery created stunning visual effects. We had the cheap seats, but as we were sitting centered and elevated directly back from the stage, we enjoyed excellent audio and visuals. Getting in and out of the arena took approximately 15 min. each, not bad. A beer costs $12. Plenty of restrooms including outdoor ones so you didn't have a long wait. Highly recommend this venue for concerts, will definitely return.",Violettini
50,Huge venue,The Forum is an enormous venue and is clean and well maintained.The facilities - restrooms and food/drink outlets - are plentiful.The downsides to share are that the parking cost us $25 and a beer $10. The most expensive beer during our vacation in fact :-(,BubblyTripper
30,Not a fan,The acoustics vary and I was very disappointed at a recent concert. I thought that the performers were awful but I talked to others who attended and they had a different experience- I can only attribute this to the placement of speakers. The parking is very expensive and signage is not user friendly. Doubt if I will go back in the future,sworrels
40,Huge venue! Great event!,"I came here for the VMA's 2014 and it was fun, I had a great time. The venue is huge and there was plenty of parking. You can tell they just renovated this place or it is still in the process of being completed. However, everything looked very nice ad up-to date. The seating area is really nice, especially when you are sitting for 2 hours plus.",Lana2011
50,This place Rocks,Son and I are the dynamic duo of traveling and fun so when I scored tickets to The Forum to see Queen + Adam Lambert back in July son was all for the adventure. We flew out to CA for the concert and let me tell you we had a great time.I have to give a huge shout out to The Forum for their exceptional service. You see as much as I enjoy concerts and traveling I do it with a bit of caution. As a woman with Multiple Sclerosis and renal failure it can get a little touchy when attending huge events and not all venues are equipped to deal with fans like me. The Forum however went above and beyond to accommodate me.It started when I called to secure tickets for the show. I talked to Frank and explained to him that due to MS I has limited vision range. He managed to work his magic and got me front row tickets for the show he is my hero. Most venues when you explain vision impairment they stick you in the balcony(which is silly when you ca't see to begin with) not The Forum it was front and center.When I arrived at venue everyone was so sweet and helpful. When it came time to enter and go to my seat one of the security guards was kind enough to escort me down the stairs so I wouldn't fall. Another point in their favor.I made it to my seat safely and not only had the best time of my life but it was the first time I had been to a venue that was so helpful and was able to accommodate my handicap issue. The show was beyond believable which was expected and the fact I was able to see was even better. Plus when the show was over the security guards were so kind that they offered to escort me out so I wouldn't get hurt.I mean the look on my son's face alone told me how amazing the show was. For me the service I received fro The Forum was top notched. If I am ever in the LA area again The Forum will be my choice of venue for events for sure. If you ever get the chance to attend a concert or live vent there go they are amazing people their.,Rebecca B
40,Came here for Backstreet Boys,"I've never been to The Forum until recently to see Backstreet Boys. There's parking around the venue, but if you can try to park outside for cheaper parking.Once inside, drinks are crazy expensive so I opted for one drink while there. The lobby is nicely remodled. I'd love to come back here again for concerts.",kisssmee
40,Great Evening.,Saw Aerosmith here on a recent visit to LA. We were lucky to have floor seats near the front and I thought it was a great atmosphere. Parking was easy although we did pay extra for privilege parking. Sound was good and everything seemed well organised.,Hazel K
50,Greaat sound,"The Forum will always be great. Sound was great, clean bathrooms, good food choices, parking in and out was good.",KBCH
40,Spiffy Forum & Features,"My fiancee and I attended the Mike Epps Comedy show on July 25, 2014 at the Forum and I was really amazed how the Forum have been kept up. I have never been there before, but I can tell it was once a sports arena. They have taken down the scoreboard out of the ceiling, That was the first thing I looked for and I was told that it was removed. The set up was nice for the comedy show. If you did not know it was once the place for the Los Angeles Lakers to play you would not have known unless you walked all the way around on the upper levels where it was blocked. I must say they did a find job revitalizing the Forum for future entertainment. It was starting to go down or looking as if it was run down prior to. I look forward to coming back for more entertainment at the Forum. As far as the show, it was alright. One of the comedians information they were stating was not funny to me at all. Mike Epps still have it.",beautiful315
50,I have a crush on The Forum!,"Oh how I love seeing shows at the Forum!! Let me count the ways: incredibly easy access to the South Bay and right off the freeway for everyone else, ginormous no muss no fuss parking lot, fully staffed with friendly employees, awesome esthetics (from the outside the red and white building is beautiful against the bright blue sky as well as brilliantly lit up at night) and inside it reminds me of a fancy airport terminal stocked with numerous food and alcohol bars (though the pretzel cheese did leave something to be desired! Yikes!) The worst seats are only 2 levels up versus 3 at larger arenas and unless you are sitting on the very sides of the stage, the sound is pretty decent. The ticket prices so far haven't been too scary either which is impressive. I've just recently seen Boston/Cheap Trick and Arcade Fire and I am SOLD on the Forum! In fact, I will now specifically seek out shows there due to its high ""User Friendly"" scores! Way to go to the Powers That Be (same people that are behind Madison Square Gardens in NYC) who resurrected this once musical Mecca and it will only be a matter of time before the Forum is getting ALL the good shows! Kudos! Please hang framed or digital photos of all the greats that played here back in the day!!",Sally M
40,Still Great after-all-these-years,"The Forum's free wifi is named ""Fabulous Forum"" it isn't far-off from the truth. Aside from the tight spacing between rows, think discount airline, it is a pleasant place. It's cool that the ""classic"" original architecture has been enhanced and the lightning made current.The bar(s) and concession areas are inviting and well attended-to and service was commendable. The space overall, made it easy to catch-up and converse with friends. The wall-art or almost-murals to the greats ( Michael Jackson, Elvis and others who have performed here) are a nice touch. The venue is small(er) and at capacity may seat upwards 17,500 whereas the Staples Center is nearly 18,118. It may be better to hear a band rather a single vocalist, or sole performer due the bleakness looking-towards, a well-lit, empty or unfilled stage. There are really no bad seats - again, the venue is fab.Men's & Women's Restrooms are subterranean - meaning steps down & back-up, it's meant to eliminate lines encroaching into concession areas - surely a 1960's design noting smoking was allowed indoors back then. Other reviewers may not have considered the decade(s) of original design.Parking is cash only, $25.00 on average. Cocktails a 1.5oz pour - $11.00; and a large Heinken $12. Credit cards are accepted at concession areas.",TGDino
20,Poor sound system,Saw Steely Dan last night. The music was distorted and you couldn't hear the vocals. I hope they fix it before November. I have (expensive) tickets to see Fleetwood Mac.,Honu P
10,What new sound system?,"Queen +Adam Lambert on July 3: we were so excited to see one of our favorite bands with the addition of a great singer in the ""totally refurbished"" Forum. We'd read that Madison Square Garden had redone the Forum to make a premier music venue. Our seats were to the right of the stage, fairly high up, but had a good view of the entire stage. When the music started, we all turned to each other and said "" sure hope they fix the sound soon"". It sounded like we were out in the parking lot listening to the concert. There didn't seem to be any monitors on either side of the stage and the only people on their feet or dancing were right in front of the stage. I don't think we'll ever go back to this venue. The sound in the Forum was better when it was a basketball court. In addition the bathrooms were all down 2 flights of stairs and very dangerous.",Erikab1960
10,Pathetic Food and Beverage,"At the Queen concert Thursday we arrived about an hour early to find the doors closed. The outdoor food and beverage service was pathetic. There was no food at the one hot dog stand open because they were out of the paper ""boats"" they put under the hot dogs. Hundreds of people would walk up to the stand and they would say order your hot dog at the bar. I stood in line at the bar to be told they had no hot dogs because they had no paper boats. They opened the doors finally and there were huge lines to get over priced prepackaged sandwiches. That was it for your Fabulous Forum food service. Can these people be more incompetent? Also if you purchased a water they poured the bottle into a cup and had no lids. How stupid is that. Beers are $12. Nice gouge.",Mike W
50,Eagles!,The grand re-opening of the forum! It was an excellent show with the Eagles! The Forum looked amazing and the acoustics are still awesome. The only downer was the size of the seats. Seems that they are made for tiny people!,Tom V
50,The Fabulous Forum Is Back & Better Than Ever,"We had a first hand personal tour of the Forum before it was opened to the public & was absolutely a wonderful makeover. I remember the Forum in it's hey day & it's better than ever. Service was great, seating & views are good no matter where you sit. Access to the location is a breeze & there is plenty of parking. You'll be glad you came!",BARBARA H
50,Kings of Leon - too easy...,The Forum (apparently recently re-opened) is a great venue for music and I'm sure for sports too. Getting there from LA downtown was a cinch and getting back again was easy too. The venue seems well organised so there was no queuing for hours for anything and the service/food/beer was awesome. Had a great night.,whenareyoucominghome
30,The Forum as a concert venue....,"Attended the tobyMac concert 3/1/14...our seats were in section 111, row 15. The concert wasn't sold out which turned out to be a blessing for us. If it had been sold out, we would have been in a squishy predicament :-( but by the 4th song, we moved up to row 16 where no one was sitting and had plenty of elbow room. The men's bathroom behind out section was inconvenient to get to, long flight of stairs to walk down and then a long flight of stairs to walk back up. The staff we encountered were friendly except for one parking lot attendant who was impatient while directing traffic.",Larry Galinato
30,Great Concert-Venue Not So mUch,"The Paul Simon/Sting concert brought us to the Forum in Inglewood. I had read that the venue had recently been rehabbed by the MSG (Madison Square Garden) folks after standing empty for a while. This is a review of the venue, not the concert (which was great!).Full disclosure: I am not a frequent concert-goer, so my comments should be taken in that light.Parking was easy and straight forward - right on the grounds, several entrances, plenty of directions. For this concert the parking fee was $25.00, which is what I expected.We were there early (coming up from San Diego) so we knew we'd have to wait a while. The security folks told us the doors would open at 6:30 (the concert was at 8). Lines started forming at the ramps and 6:30 came and went and no movement. At about 6:50, we were allowed access to the outer doors; about 7:15 the inner doors were open and in we poured.As has been mentioned in other tripadvisor.com postings, the food available at the venue is expensive (a bottle of water was $4.50) and limited. However, between the lateness of the access and the long lines at the two stations on our side of the venue, many people were still getting food when the concert began at about 8:15. Solutions: 1) plan a late dinner at a restaurant; or, 2) bring something for a little tailgating. Don't depend on the arena for dinner.As for the main event, we knew our seats were far away (budgetary considerations) but we had a good view of the stage and the large monitors gave us the close-ups (good camerawork on the part of the Forum crew). Being spoiled by video productions and recordings, the mix of orchestra to voice sounded overwhelming to me. The music was TERRIFIC; production value not so much - just a lot of flashing lights in changing colors (whether that's the artists' decision or the venue's, I don't know).Speaking of seats - they are pretty small and hard. No amenities like cupholders. Directions to seats were okay.Three comments that have nothing to do with the Forum: 1) the guy next to me sang throughout the concert. Fortunately, he had a good voice; 2) the three couples in front of us spent the entire concert talking, switching seats and generally being distracting; 3) for whatever reason, there were constant comings and goings during the concert-the stairways were always busy with people going up and down and I have no idea why.",Deborah J
50,Eagles Concert!!!!,"They really updated this place.... nothing to do with basketball anymore :)) great seats, acoustic and organization.... hope to go back soon....",movingtoaz
30,Loved the Eagles,"We were in LA for a few days and found out that the Eagles were performing, and as we had just seen them in September and enjoyed their show, decided to go see them. As we don't live in the area, we don't know what the Forum used to look like, so I can't compare it. The seats were comfy, as they are new. What I found strange, is that the concourse is blocked off, so you can only stay in you little section, unless you want to bounce over seats to go around, which we didn't do. The bathrooms were a little tricky for some fellow concert goers who had imbibed, as you have to go down stairs, do your business, then go upstairs on the other side. Good for the legs and butt I thought. The renos in the bathroom weren't too impressive, if they were done. I found the beer prices quite high, as US beer is way cheaper than in Canada, but you have to pay more at events. Oh well, I guess that made the $25 for parking worthwhile.",Melanie L
30,Great sound system but...,"The newly renovated Forum means a state of the art sound system and comfortable seats. Unfortunately, it is still a venue better suited for basketball. The seat rows are steeply pitched and some, to the sides of the stage, probably have a very limited view of the performers. No drink holders!!! Expect a lot of spilled beer on floor. The floor level seats ($$$) are folding chairs. The best seats are probably those direct center in the back area of the floor level or first level up. The big screens that flank the stage are best viewed straight on and if you have a seat to the side you miss whatever is projected on the center stage screens. In other words, if you want to really get the full concert experience you have to buy a seat in the top price range. You can ""hear"" the concert well from every seat but you will pay a lot of money to watch a limited view on the big screen if you aren't seated stage center. Food options: Pink's dogs, burgers, fries, sandwiches but you stand outside holding your food. Restrooms down another steeply pitched stairwell... watch out for tipsy concert goers! Outside porta-pottys, most reserved for women, were okay but lights were out in some. Parking is $25 - high, even for L.A. Waited for crowd to thin out so we didn't have to deal with traffic exiting lot.",101travelers
20,Long lines for everything!,"Make certain that your bladder is empty and that you are well hydrated and fed before you get here! Lines for food and bathrooms were ridiculous! Even for the smelly Port-a-Pottys that circled the outside of the venue! When I pay SEVERAL hundreds of dollars to attend an event (per person), I do NOT expect Port-A-Pottys to be the primary toilet facilities!Lines for food/beverage were just as bad. Parking rate ridiculous ($25) and flow in the lot dis-organized.Inside, seats were nicely padded; but, even my 5'4"" frame felt the lack of leg room. Also, I noticed SEVERAL people slip and nearly fall on the stairs. They had gotten wet (spilled beverages?) and the cement stairs had no texture to them! A law suit in the making IMHO!",Desertrose56
30,Eagles Great; But not The Forum,"We went to see the Eagles open for the relaunch of The Forum as a high-end concert hall. The Forum is now owned by the same owners of the Madison Square Garden in NYC. The Fabulous Forum went through a $100 million renovation and is now painted Forum Red instead of Laker Blue.Here are the pros:The sound system was fantastic. The Eagles are a classic band and it was great to hear real musicians. They were simply fantastic! The Eagles performed here 40 year ago so it was a great homecoming.The new red seats are very comfortable even though there were no cup holders.They had workers stationed in the woman’s restroom which helped speed up the line which is always long. The only caveat is there are two stairs wells that go down to the restrooms so I am not sure where the handicap patrons would go. Perhaps that is why there are port-a-potties outside.Here are the cons:The parking is $25. There is nowhere else to park since this neighbor is unsafe so you have no other options.There were no visible Forum workers to help you find your seat. This means if someone is late for the concert, one better bring their own flashlight to find the row and seat numbers. It was a constant disruption for concert goers during the performance. I have never seen so many people sitting in the wrong seats. They should have workers stationed at the entrance of each section just like the Honda Center.A bottled coke cost $4.50 but they don’t allow you to take the bottle. The food worker had to pour the coke into a plastic cup but there was no ice. I asked if I could get ice at the bar for free and she said yes so that is what I had to do to get a cold drink by standing in two lines. I found that very inconvenient and ridiculous. After that I decided not to purchase any more food or drink since I would probably be disappointed.Driving out after the concert was chaotic. There was no local police dept. outside The Forum guiding traffic and it was basically a free-for-all trying to funnel out of the venue. Drivers made their own traffic lanes getting to the signal light on Prairie Avenue. There were very few Forum workers guiding traffic inside the parking lots. The Honda Center knows how to manage post- concert traffic so perhaps the Forum can get some tips from Anaheim.I hope that the Forum management will fix the issues but time will tell. I might come back if it is an artist or group I really want to see perform. Hence, The Forum gets 3 stars but the Eagles get 5+ stars.",CaliLAgirl
40,"Not Fabulous, But Still Good Great Eagles Venue","Went to see the Eagles in the re-opening of the Forum. The actual inside portion is nice. The padded seats are nice and the sound is really great. The Eagles performance was excellent. They are a great guitar band and the addition of Bernie Leadon made their guitar sound even better.The Eagles were an excellent choice to open up the Forum. Their hard driving guitar and percussion music really demonstrated that the venue has a terrific sound system and you do not have to put up with all of the sports advertisement and constant neon sign changes. The big screen TV display was also beneficial in helping you enjoy the concert. If you are in the top, select seats in the lower 200 series, as their is something that blocks your view (such that it is) on the other side. But, you will not have a problem the sound in any seat, even if you may not have a close up view.The bathrooms on that level and that side were bad. You have to walk down 2 flights of stairs. While their were plenty of stalls, it is difficult to imagine that all of the people with canes and other issues relating to mobility are going to find navigating those stairs very easy. I predict falls, injuries and lawsuits. There is a hidden handicap bathroom, with a guard.The food was practically non-existent on that level. We found two vendors who sold food. But, booze was not a problem. Many full bars and beer vendors to choose from.Getting to the Forum and the parking were very easy. There were lots of parking spaces, but $25.00 is a lot of money to park your car. It was not too bad to get out after the concert is over, but you could have used a bit of traffic control The Pond always has lots of traffic control to help you get out.The staff inside were pretty non-existent. While the 2 people I interacted with were genuinely helpful, it was hard to find help. Also, when we first entered the seating (shortly before 7:00 p.m.) there was someone to help you to your seat. 30 minutes later, no one. The seating is not well marked as far as the section and the rows. So, lots of people were sitting in the wrong seats or going to the wrong seats, with no one to help out.As to the concert, Glenn was in his ""usual"" rare form. He was funny and a great front man for the band. He had great vocals, guitars and dancing, and great jokes. I really missed No More Cloudy Days, All She Wants to do is Dance and Hole in the World. They are excellent at a capella, as they have wonderful harmony. Don was equally fine in his performance. Great vocals (I love One of These Nights), he can still hit the high notes, always a great drummer and great guitar as well. Timothy B. Schmit was equally funny and is a fabulous bass player. His lead in for One of These Nights was a highlight. He also has great vocal and can also still hit the high notes. Joe Walsh has the most beautiful blonde hair and he really looks a lot younger. He was exceptional on his many guitar solos and on Life's Been Good and Funk 49. Steuart Smith was great on the guitar as well, especially Hotel California, though it did not seem to have a long enough lead with him playing it as it usually does. In addition, the ""encore"" of Hotel California seemed rushed. Bernie Leadon was a great addition. His guitar performances really added to make it a spectacular night of guitar band performance. While it was an excellent concert, I do miss the horn section, particularly the saxophones and the violin. Bringing back Best of My Love was also fabulous. I think that there were songs (just my preference) that they could have left out, and I would really like to see them perform James Dean and Old 55.I also missed Glenn playing on the keyboards.Then, there were the 2 male (must have been more in other places) Septuagenarian, who never grew up and felt is necessary to get out their medicinal marijuana and take a hit during the concert. Fortunately, the exhaust system was pretty strong and so the asthmatics did not have to suffer too much.An excellent dedicated concert venue, with a good sound system and pretty good seating. It would be nice to see one of those concerts in the round, like the one at the Pond with Carole King and James Taylor. If they have a group that you like, it would be a good choice to go see them in concert.",Mary Jean
