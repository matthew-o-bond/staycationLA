20,all trails are interesting,"easy trail, few people, take hat few shade areas, accessible by car, better during the week, don't go alone",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/etretatc
50,Way fun trail with great views and few people!,"This is a way fun trail and beautiful hike. Although gentle hike, I'd avoid small kids or outa shape elderly. Surprisingly uncrowded trail even with the leo campground nearby.It starts at Leo Carrillo State Park. Use your state park pass, pay the daily fee or park on the highway.Trailhead is near leo entrance and kinda tricky.,. Sign at trailhead says camp 13 trail but 20 yards further along is the real sign (see photos). Trail is clean and very well maintained.More than a flipflop hike but quite boots and gear. It's actually quite gentle except for initial ascent. good ocean views and then as you get around back to meadows, pond and flats. Additionally, if you follow the motorway, the views from above looking down at the pch beach homes is really cool.It's possible to hike along to the south side and exit down the very rough-unused fire road rot PCH via (nicholas canyon motorway)Excellent hike although fairly short at 7 miles or so.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Summerasalifestyle
50,good workout,"Hike here from Leo Carillo state park trailhead and get a good uphill workout with gorgeous views. Or start at the top for a gentle walk. Beautiful large pond with ducks at Nicholas flat, provided there has been winter rains. Sadly it's been dry recently.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bdkLosAngeles
50,A great 12 mile hike in Malibu,Nicholas Flats is a beautiful hike in Malibu. We did it with our 10 year old boys and they loved the challenge. From the top of this hike you see the entire ocean. There are also beautiful hidden flatlands on this hike. Kate Hamm was our guide. She is fantastic.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/568katrins
