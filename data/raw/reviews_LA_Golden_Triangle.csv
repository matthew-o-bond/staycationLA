30,Not exactly “something to do”,I’m surprised this is listed as something to do in Beverly Hills. It’s basically a street with shops designed to look like the many beautiful quaint streets in Europe. Nice shops but it’s pretty cheesy. Rodeo Drive is more interesting and authentic.,olgabs
50,Beautiful!,"Stay, take photos, enjoy walking, feel like being part of the ""Pretty Woman"" backstage and spend some time exploring the area!",Leonidas Anthop... L
40,Worth seeing if near Rodeo Drive,"While walking down Rodeo Drive we walked upon this beautiful street which has some very nice photo opportunities.

40,Lovely little spot!,Didn't feel like I was even in America when we were here...much more relaxed vibe about it. Tiffany's and Versace are a must and some lovely little restaurants to choose from. Lovely.,catp79
20,Like a shopping mall at Dubai Airport,"If you haven’t seen a Prada- Gucci-, Ralf Lauren- or Giorgio Armani-boutique before this is the place to go. They are all here and all XXL.Also good place to watch rare end extremely expensive automobiles.And you won’t stumble across any homeless people.But sterile and boring. And well, quite nice buildings.",Torben A
40,Versace is king. Two short blocks of Europe,"The rest of Rodeo is more interesting but this little alcove really does have a European feel. It even feels like cobblestones but doesn't actually have then. It goes up a bit of a hill, has art gallery and Versace and a bit more.",Chinapjs
50,Still the Spot,"So fun, so touristy, so LA, so picture perfect. Of course, if you are doing the tourist thing, this is one iconic spot, so check it out, albeit just an intersection of streets colliding on the Rodeo Drive zone. Fun people watching, and, of course, can say been there done that.",PlatinumHoney

40,Exclusive shops,This area is like a touch of Europe with its attractive buildings and street lamps giving it some old-worldly charm.

50,Beautiful,"Absolutely beautiful place, lots of high end stores, gorgeous palms, pure opulence. You will see lots of high end cars, and of course lots of them honking at each other, but it is just a wonderful place to visit. Wonderful restaurants on Canon and Beverly!",StephanieSelene

50,It's golden for a reason,"Can't say we ""shopped"" but we certainly enjoyed window shopping, and what a place. All the big names, but sorry-- no outlets! I will say that every time I visit, I wonder why they do not plant more trees. More natural green to accompany the greenbacks would be good.",Robin G
50,Cool place off Rodeo Drive,Neat little walk near Rodeo Drive. Cobblestone street and a fun cafe at the end. Wish we could have seen inside the stores more but overall it was a neat spot to visit.,Mark A
40,"Glam, Glitz and Money","I had always wanted to visit Beverly Hill and because we only had a day to spend here we chose to have a look at the Golden Triangle. It was amazing seeing the streets beautifully decorated (we're from Australia and have just recently arrived home). We came here during Christmas time. They even had some activities for the young families. To which my kids thoroughly enjoyed!There was also a park near by, if you're kids ever get to wrestles.",Mele D

20,"Dead as a door nail on a Saturday""","Well the only thing lef of Rodeo Drive is employee arrogance it still exists believe it or not the worker thinks they own the place and not friendly or helpful I think all the peole in the stores came from the ""American Gigolo"" school of retail...",bateso
50,Great people watching,The triangle is the shopping area of Beverly Hills and you can find Rodeo Dr with its luxury shops and Canon with its wide variety of great restaurants. We walk and windowshop often in the pleasant evenings and can see people from all over the world. It is a big tourist stop. We like Heritage wine shop for their friendliness and good French wine and snacks. A good place to rest with a glass of wine. Shopping or strolling at Christmas time you will see beautiful decorations in the shop windows and the city streets.,wilywizard
40,More than Rodeo,"While Rodeo is the center piece, there is more to the Golden Triangle as far as shopping and eating. We ate at Villa Blanca and my wife enjoy buying some things at the stores off Rodeo like Kyle. I also agree with another writer than there are several high end auto manufacturers that you can visit here in a showroom. There are few retail districts that you can do that. Enjoy the experience here.",Grover R

50,Ultimate Shopping District in Beverly Hills - Rodeo Drive (No Extra Charge),"Classy Rodeo Drive is the anchor of this unforgettable shopping experience - you must see to believe. Not for the bargain shopper, this classy area has designer stores to see the latest trends, including Versace, Chanel, Gucci, Yurman and many more. Great restaurants and coffee shops, many with outside patio seating offer prime viewing of celebrities. Auto enthusiasts will be captivated by the steady traffic of each passing Maserati or Rolls Royce, among the more uncommon BMWs and Mercedes. Noise from drivers horns sounding horns from these gorgeous gems is, at times, annoying. Still, these noisy drivers keep the auto watchers alert so as not to miss one. After you shop, find an outdoor table at Two Rodeo on Wilshire or Panini Café at Santa Monica Blvd on the northern side of the Golden Triangle and you’re ready for at least an hour or two of relaxation and entertainment.The ‘Golden Triangle’ is flanked by Wilshire Boulevard, Santa Monica and Rexford (somewhat on the eastern side of the 'triangle.' Of course, most visitors stay on Rodeo Drive or within a few blocks in either direction. For people watching try Two Rodeo, the restaurant on the pedestrian street, Via Rodeo. Or, Rodeo Drive - no explanation needed. Whether you spend $$$ for jeans, jewelry, or shoes; watch pet lovers sporting carriages for their tiny fur babies; or see a celebrity crossing Wilshire Boulevard as you sip you glass of Merlot, this will be a visit to remember in the heart of Beverly Hills. During the holidays, high across Wilshire Blvd you’ll find a sleigh with Santa and reindeer among the palm trees. Nice area to visit or shop with affordable dining and guilt-free people watching! Fabulously fun!",RikiUSA
