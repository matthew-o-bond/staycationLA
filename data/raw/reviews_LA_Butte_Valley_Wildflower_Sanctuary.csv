30,Lonely desert parcel at the north edge of LA County,"This is one of the several LA County wildlife sanctuaries that give you breathing room to walk undisturbed, gaze at desert plants and animals, or just enjoy the silence. Perched on a plateau north of Saddleback Butte State Park, this 350-acre parcel is surrounded by a lush forest of Joshua trees, with trails that lead more or less nowhere. In springtime you can see a wide array of colorful California wildflowers. Travel a little further north, and you'll come to a cliff with views of Edwards Air Force Base; drive along nearby avenues to find two widely used professional movie sets decorated as vintage roadside stopovers, Club Ed and the Four Aces.",SoCalRambler
