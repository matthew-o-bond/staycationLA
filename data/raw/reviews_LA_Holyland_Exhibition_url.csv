50,review,Visited on a Saturday afternoon with friends and had an enjoyable and informative time. This exhibition has some interesting artifacts. Come with an open mind.btw I have been to Israel twice and this is not that. But I do recommend it. Donation was only $2.50 with an opportunity to buy souvenirs.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Indo-flyer
50,This unique place is worth the effort of making an appointment.,I love the collections here and the unique enclave that is the Holyland Exhibition. Dr. Futterer was a unique character and had an interesting way of presenting the stories of the bible.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GretaNova
50,Los Angeles - Hidden Gem,"This a great place to visit if you like archeology and history and have a couple of hours. I've been to this place about 5 times in the last year, but have been visiting for the last 20 years. It is a great place to take family and friends. Every visit is different and you get to see many new different artifacts or thins you missed in prior visits. A previous reviewer indicated that they have bad customer service. I've been the so many times, it has always been pleasant. You can visit this place by appointment only, that is why they ask at what time you want to come in. They take 1 person or 100. You get a docent tour and you can ask questions. My kids always have fun when it comes time to dress up, during the tour. This place has artifacts brought back to USA in the 20s. This is the phone number (323) 664-3162. You can also visit the small store and purchase really cool stuff at great prices.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lxjuarez
10,Racisim at it's finest,"The whole point of this exhibit is to prove since Jesus is a desendent of Shem, it must mean that Jesus was white. They have decided that the Lord made everyone from three pots of clay; white, black and red. The white clay being of most value. There were many Egyptian artifacts in the room. One has to assume they were removed from Egypt prior to it being illegal to remove such artifacts. A very rude awaking of someone's interperation of the Bible. I can sum this up by stating I am white and have a strong beleif in the Lord. He would never approve of such racially charged overtones to his Life.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/segallison

50,Great tour,"A hidden gem worth finding. My wife,daughter and I took the tour and were impressed and not only saw a great exhibit but learned bible history. If you are looking for a nice two hour tour you will not be disappointed. Off the beaten path but easy to find in Silver lake",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RPDStAugustine
50,Hidden gem,I visited this place about 15 years ago and was just blown away because of the amount of artifacts on display. Plenty of photos also. It really is a hidden treasure. Nothing fancy and the spaces are small. Anyone interested in archaeology or history will appreciated this place. The refreshments (tea) at the end is a nice touch. Small gift shop available.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dennie30
50,Holyland Exhibition,"This is a don't miss if you are at all religious & in the Los Angeles area! This museum, founded in 1924, is certainly one of Southern California's forgotten gems. The collection here contains a wealth of Middle Eastern artifacts, some of which are more than 2,000 years old. Collected by explorer Antonio F. Futterer during his years abroad, some of the smaller items here include lamps, bottles and coins. The impressive mummy casket dates 600 years before the birth of Christ. Today the museum can be visited only by appointment for a small fee, which covers a tour. Go to their website for more information. I have to say that I understood the Bible a lot better after visiting this museum & touching all of the thinks that Jesus would have. Very inspirational.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lauraswaft
