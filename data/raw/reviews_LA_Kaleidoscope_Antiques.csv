30,AMAZING items. HORRIBLE prices.,"Kaleidoscope Antiques is a tough place to rate. If I were to rate it purely on the items they have, I would give it five stars! It's super cool! They had a ton of awesome things I was really interested in. However, if I were to rate based on prices, I'd probably rate it one star! The prices are truly laughable and it was pretty shocking. I am no stranger to antique shops, so it's not like I don't have a realistic understanding of what is generally expected price wise. I was honestly shocked at the prices. There were even a couple of ""going out of business"" 50% off sales, and EVEN THOSE were originally marked so high, making a purchase didn't make sense! Things you normally see in the early to late teens were all in the thirties, closer to forty.That said, they did have some cool items to see. So if you're more into window shopping and looking at this more like a museum, then I's highly recommend it. If your goal is to make a purchase, this is a bad investment. If you're in the area, there's no harm in looking and judging for yourself. Hopefully they'll get the message... and each booth has different owners, so I'm sure there are deals to be had if you strike it right... but I literally had SEVERAL items from all over the store I would have considered purchasing at the right price, and it was mostly three or four times what it should be even for an antique store.",Michael T
