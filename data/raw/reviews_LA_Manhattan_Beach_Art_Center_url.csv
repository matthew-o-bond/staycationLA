40,Tiny but quaint,"Stopped in for a quick visit — it is really only two exhibit rooms so you don’t need much time. We were lucky to see the exhibit based on toys, which I believe just ended. The next exhibit will focus on jewelry. It is a nice place for a bit of peace and quiet.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PMath5516
40,Laid Back Gem,"This tiny museum sits across from a large city park and on the main road to Manhattan Beach pier. The round building is fairly easy to spot from the road. Inside we found in June 2017 a small photo show with some excellent shots of local sights, such as the Manhattan pier. Admission is free and free parking is in the back or on the street. There are a few tables/chairs at the entry, but no gift shop or food sales within. For a cool break from the hustle and bustle of main street and the pier scene, pop into the Manhattan Beach Art Center.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlobalGypsy_13
50,Yes! (previous reviewer) It's a hidden gem!,"Looking for things to do to stay out of the sun & get inspired & ""found"" this gallery on Tripadvisor. I walked to the Art Center from Manhattan Beach Marriott thru beautiful streets & was so happy I took the chance. The ""Dance of Thought"" exhibit by Shane Guffogg, which is absolutely awesome, is on display! The people working in the gallery from reception to an artist (working in another room) to the gallery's director/curator (?) all approached me with cheerfulness & education about the art works... & further explained all the classes offered there! Nice little Polliwog Park across the street too. Highly recommended :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M2020VPjanem
50,A hidden gem for art Lovers,"Through July 2nd go see The Family Plot, a fabulous art show sponsored by Time For Art Foundation and curated by the Amazing Homeira Goldstein. Homeira, of Homeira Style, has brought Manhattan beach, works from living legend Ed Moses. Homeira's family theme is complemented by the superior work of Andy Moses. Andy's latest work is stunning and we think his best ever. Lastly artist Kelly Berg is also seen. Trust that if Homeirs did the show it's worth the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TonyFi18
