50,Best of the Santa Monica Mountains,"Sandstone Peak is the highest point in the Santa Monica Mountains and offers the best views in all directions. On a clear day you can see the ocean, Channel Islands, and distant mountain ranges. Thereâ€™s a little register at the top for you to sign. In addition to Sandstone Peak, the Circle X Ranch area has great trails. Can get busy on weekends.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lovemarmots
50,Sandstone Peak in Santa Monica Mountains,"An amazing 6-8 mile hike, with extraordinary views of the Pacific Ocean. Since recent fires, there is a great deal of exposure, so I'd recommend wearing a hat, sunscreen, sunglasses, and carrying water. Trails are obvious and there are several options of out and back treks, or loop treks.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/apache511
