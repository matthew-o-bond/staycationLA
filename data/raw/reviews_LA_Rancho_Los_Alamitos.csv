50,Total package: History & Gardens- And the price is right-Free!!!!,"My traveling partner was attending a conference so I decided to catch the city bus from the Westin and visit this beautiful property.I mainly went for the gardens but was delighted with the whole experience! First of all, the docent Camille was incredible. You may wander around the property unescorted, but in order to visit the adobe home you must tour with a docent. Perhaps because it was a weekday in February, but there was only one other person on the adobe tour with me, so it felt like a private tour. Camille gave us the history from the Native Americans through the last owners-the Bixby Family. She was very interesting and informative.After, the adobe house tour, I began wandering the gardens and met Janet who I believe is in charge of the gardens. I say gardens because there are different garden sections. Although she was working, she took the time to answer some of my questions and gave me a mini tour. Even though it was February and there wasn't much in bloom, the gardens were still incredible. They have a very nice succulent/cactus garden. Would love to return to see the roses and Jacaranda trees in bloom!They have a gift shop. There is a large green lawn. I'm not sure if you are allowed to bring food in, but this would be a great family outing. In addition to the adobe house and gardens, they have a big red barn that houses a big draft horse, a couple of ponies and goats with hens free ranging. They also have a blacksmith that apparently comes and does demonstrations. The day I visited, all the docents were very welcoming.The rancho is located in a gated subdivision and only allows you in when it opens at 1pm.As an aside to home gardeners, there are 2 giant ficus trees with 2 giant palm trees growing through the canopy of the ficus trees. I was told when Mrs Bixby planted them around 100 years ago, the trees seem spaced adequately. Who hasn't planted trees in their sapling states in distances that seemed far enough but then in their maturity were much too close. Check it out when you go!So, if you love: gardens, history, farm animals, great docents and a fabulous bargain price, this is one of the big item tickets in Long Beach to visit!",labonvoyer
50,"Beautiful, historical hidden gem",Rancho Los Alamitos is a beautiful and historical part of Long Beach history. Gorgeous gardens and the historical house and barns are worth the time to spend. Go!,Pamela C
50,A little bit of local California history,"Fanastic placve to visit. It is somewhat hard to find, as it's behind a gated community with guard. Just tell the guard your visiting the rancho and they let you in. You can walk around and enjoy or take a tour and have them explain the history around this location (I'd highly recommend you do this). There's so much to absorb, I'd recommend going back again to get it all in.Very highly recommended.... No charge for anything, but you can give donation if you wish.",Don B
50,Escape to Peace and Beauty (and history!),Rancho Los Alamitos is an oasis of beauty and peace in the middle of Long Beach. The gardens call to me but others find the history of the place to be the real draw. You can get an excellent sense of California history in this refuge from the hustle and bustle of the city.,Donna S
40,"An interesting, hidden oasis of California history","I was passing through the area and searched TripAdvisor for any interesting homes to visit. My elderly mother was with me, and she especially likes that sort of thing. We found this spot, and it was a perfect, little side trip on our drive. Tucked up right next to Cal State Long Beach, this home, garden, barn, and animals includes a fascinating mini museum about SoCal's history. After the natives, of course, the land belonged in 1790 to Manuel Nieto, one of the original members of the Gaspar de Portola expedition. Within in just a few generations it ended up with the Bixby family (1880s), when the land was used for ranching (before oil, Hollywood, or big cities).",Mark J
50,Enter into a different place and time.,"This place dates from the early 1800's. Admission is free. You can opt for a guided tour of the house, but you can also just stroll the grounds on your own. My family chose the self-guided stroll. We enjoyed the goats, sheep, horses, and chickens. The impressive flora includes roses, giant cacti, a lush wall of Cyprus trees, and a fluttering curtain of bamboo.",Kathy D
40,A Tongva Treasure with Glorious Gardens,"Hidden in a gated residential community, Rancho Los Alamitos is a wonderful place to spend a few hours going back in history and exploring the grounds. The gardens are spectacular though it could do with a tea room or small cafe. Docents are friendly and knowledgeable, but while the Bixby family absolutely deserves recognition and gratitude for donating the property for public use, it would be nice if there was more focus on the land's Native American and Spanish connections. Still, with buildings intact and animals in residence, it's easy to imagine what life was like on the rancho.",VagabondKatt
50,Surprise! Paradise on a hilltop!,"I've visited twice now, and what I love is you can see something new each time. There are two areas of most interest to me: The 'farm', and the gardens. It can all be enjoyed in a day, but if you're a photographer you'll likely return again. And the garden sights will change with the seasons (On my late June visit the concord grapes were plump but still green). It was getting warm, and after being in the cactus garden for awhile I laid-down on the soft grass lawn beneath one of the two huge 100+ year-old Morton Bay fig trees, and watched the sky as low-flying airliners on approach to Long Beach Airport flew by. They don't disturb the peace, and as an aviation fan I get some great close-ups as they pass.I had already been greeted by one of the docents, Joyce, who guided me to a particular plant I was looking for; and I later talked to Joyce's husband, Craig, who was a wealth of information about the garden and the rest of the Rancho. That was fascinating talking to him. And to think all of this beauty and charm is free to visitors like us. You will need to get a pass at the gated community entrance (just say you're going to the Rancho, and the guard hands you a pass that you display on the dash). There is a good-sized paved parking lot, and nearby street parking if it's full. I'm fully ambulatory, but I noted that those folks with limited mobility will still be able to get around most of the areas of interest.Be sure to check on the days and times they're open before you go.",Greg B
50,Wonderful Gardens!,"This rancho is a hidden jewel in a busy city. I highly recommend visiting the gardens, some of the most lovely gardens in Long Beach. A nice quiet spot to contemplate life. This is off the beaten path, and a place for solitude and thinking about history.",Will
50,Lovely and Interesting,"This place is a hidden gem across the street from CSULB and located in a gated community. Stop at the guardhouse and you get a pass to park. Adjacent to the parking lot is the Visitor Center where you sign and are greeted by lovely, helpful docents. There is an informative 15 minute movie that gives you the history of the area and the Bixby family who owned 26,000 acres originally and donated the remaining 7.5 acres to the City of Long Beach in 1968.After the movie you enter the Rancho and walk to the barn, tack room and stables where 3 or 4 horses live. You also see a few sheep and a couple of goats in pens, a chicken coop and interesting old farm equipment. There are several gardens to explore. We found the Cactus Garden especially interesting.You can tour the family residence, but have to arrange for a guide at the visitor center. We absolutely loved perusing the different rooms of this lovely house, which has the original furniture, rugs and object d’art collected by the family. It feels like a family house and not a museum. You end the tour in the kitchen with an old wood stove and various 1930s utensils and kitchenware. Loved it! We highly recommend touring this piece of Long Beach history.",Constance M
50,Wisteria is Blooming,"If you want a delightful scent of Spring, this is the time to visit Ranchos Los Alamitos as the Wisteria is blooming. First of all the welcome station docents were especially cordial as they wanted me to know the wisteria flowers were in full bloom. One of them walked me out and pointed me towards the gas pumps where I saw beautiful lilac colored wisteria. But the fascinating part is as soon as you got within 25 feet the delightful scent hit you full force. That is not the only place to see them They are also on the east side of the tennis court. There are other Spring flowers in bloom at the ranch and you should find it a pleasure to visit before others take their place.Also there are two new brochures available at the desk.",Joseph C

50,Jump into a Beautiful 1930's Christmas.,"The Rancho was dressed for Christmas and it did not disappoint. They had a special tour of the house. A docent was in each room to answer any questions and talk a little of how the Bixby family used the room, bringing the room to life. The Rancho was beautifully decorated for Christmas, but it is lovely to see any time of year. You can also tour the outside buildings.There is an interesting short film about the rancho and a wonderful display for life on the rancho. There are farm animals here, as well. There is a gift shop with a thoughtful inventory and a little something for every budget. For the Christmas celebration, the open house was complete with refreshments. A delightful evening.",799eileen

50,Docent Tour of the Home is Special,"The reception we received was friendly. While they arranged for our docent tour of the home we asked for a wheelchair. One was available making it easier on us. We did not have time for the gardens, but our experience visiting the home made it not matter. We will be back to see the gardens, but the home was a delight. It reminded me of the times I visited my grandparents' home in Connecticut as a child. So filled with good memories.",Joseph C

40,Unexpected in the Area Where it is Located,"Rancho Los Alamitos is like an oasis in the desert. It's hard to believe it exists at all, considering the fact that it's basically in a suburban environment.I came here after reading about it, in the paper. It's beautifully maintained.

40,Relic of a bygone era of Ranchos and Open Space,"One might expect to find that one of the great Southern California Ranchos would be easy to access, a feeling for California history and a relaxing quiet escape from the modern world. This Rancho achieves two out of the three.From the ancient Morton Bay Fig Trees to the live farm animals it does provide an escape. Over time, the Rancho restoration has progressed significantly. Yet, some of the most intriguing historical artifacts (the early vacuum cleaners that had to be pumped for example) have been tucked away from the eye of the visitor.Unfortunately, the location has become popular enough so that on site parking is inadequate; parking in the neighborhood of the Rancho off-site results in a citation. One can only hope that the continued popularity of the site may result in a shuttle from an area outside of the protected neighborhood to the Rancho or some other creative solution to allow the neighbors their privacy while providing access to the Rancho.",Jerry H

40,Historical gem hidden away in a Long Beach gated neighborhood,"We've been here several times, and it's a very nice way to introduce some of California's more colorful history to out of town guests. Nestled in an affluent subdivision not far from Cal State's Long Beach campus, the Rancho offers a lot for both history buffs, and children. Start the tour off in the main building off the smallish parking lot, and there you'll be greeted by volunteer staff, where you can choose to join a guided tour by a docent, or venture through the very manageable grounds by yourself. Highlights include the history wall in the main building, showing the Rancho's long history and interesting factoids in a great visual way. There's also a decent video to give those with a shorter attention span a more condensed story. Kids love the barn, where several horses and some other farm animals call home, and of course the well-preserved house from the early 20th century is probably the star attraction for most people. Be sure to check out the massive trees in front of the house. All in all, a nice way to spend a couple of hours.",Alan m

50,"Fantastic, amazing home and grounds; highly recommended","Rancho Los Alamitos turned out to be an awesome surprise after I decided to visit after reading about rancho history. I have been living/working in SoCal since 1981, and had no idea this was here. I would recommend a trip here to anyone who is interested in learning about the Bixby family and properties in pre- and early-day Long Beach. It is twice listed on the National Register of Historic Places. [Note: this is a sister property to the Rancho Los Cerritos, also in Long Beach, about five miles to the northwest; see note below and separate review]As explained in the tour, the residential buildings underwent a series of expansions/additions, and the result is an impeccably maintained historic register property. In addition, there are few barns, stables, numerous farm animals (check out the beautiful shire horses wandering around) and an array of gardens that are of “must see” caliber. Although not palatial, the home itself is very well appointed with things the Bixby family members were able to acquire as a result of the oil boom in the 1920s. There’s a really good vibe throughout the “house walk.”The tour I took was more relaxed in the sense that the docent didn’t talk continually to a tightly bunched group. Rather, we were allowed to move around somewhat freely while we were outside, with the docent hanging around to answer questions and unlock doors for us.The gardens are really cool (get a brochure at the Rancho Center). The formally designed areas incorporate “walks” featuring geraniums, oleanders and jacarandas, and a nice balance between vegetation and hardscape. Especially noteworthy is the cactus garden, which is interspersed with many trees and large shrubberies to create a “woodsy desert” environment (contradictory, I know), the likes of which I’ve never experienced before … much different than the [awesome] cactus gardens at the Huntington Gardens or the L.A. Arboretum.Admission is free (donations welcome), but one can see the home only by way of a tour (~ one hour). At the beginning of the tour, the group stops to examine a big wall display of the building expansion chronology, then to tennis-court-sized room where a huge map of the Los Coyotes grant divisions is laid out on the floor. The brochure indicates that the gardens and barn area can be toured in a self-guided manner.For your consideration:* To access the property you must stop at a private residential security gate on Palo Verde Avenue, where a guard will give you a one-day rancho visitor pass. Go up the hill to the end, take a left, then an immediate right. Place the pass on your dashboard. Parking is free.* The Bixby Hill Community Association parking pass says RANCHO ONLY, and contains scary text referring to penal code violations for trespassing on private streets. I’m not sure of the proper course to take if one were to find the rancho parking lot full (about four dozen spaces).* Since part of the tour is outdoors make sure you have a hat and/or sunscreen if you’re sensitive to strong sun on a hot day.* Photography, even without flash, is NOT allowed indoors (bummer).* Check out the two huuuuge Moreton Bay fig trees just outside the screened-in porch.* TRY THIS: Visiting both Rancho Los Alamitos and Rancho Los Cerritos (not as mind-blowing, but still worth a trip) makes for a great afternoon of Long Beach rancho history. Since both properties are open only from 1:00 to 5:00, try to arrive for the 1:00 tour at either location, then venture over to the other rancho (~20 mins drive) to catch the 3:00 tour. I did this; it worked great. I would give priority to Rancho Los Alamitos because the visit is likely to take longer (more to enjoy).",Jim L
50,Bueno,Great place to discover the early history of Long Beach Ca. Too bad the cluster of our present culture has choked this whole place. This place takes you back to a time when things were very different. Old trees...old well restored California buildings and cool stuff. You get to tour the place and it is fun to see how they ranched and lived years ago. I was born In Long Beach and it took me 59 year's to make a visit...please Don t wait that long. Great place. My wife and I had a great visit with friendly people and guides.,tripbhb
50,So peaceful you'll forget you're in a city!,My aunt and I visited Rancho Los Alamitos during our CA trip for a break from the hustle and bustle of LA. What a great idea we had! The buildings and grounds are absolutely beautiful. We enjoyed walking through the gardens and seeing the large trees! Tons of historical objects as well to enjoy. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a peaceful retreat from the city.,VTHokie08
50,Docent guided tour of the adobe house,"Our friends who live in Orange accompanied us on a visit to Rancho Los Alamitos. We hadn't checked the open hours, and arrived too early. There is a gatehouse and a guard on duty who advised us to return at the correct time. I'm glad we did so. Our docent guide was excellent. I admire how well they provide information and can answer visitor's questions such as ""how old is that stove?"". The docent took our group of four people into the map room (the map is on the floor). I was able to point out the Naples area of Long Beach where my grandparents had lived. Then after giving the history of the Rancho, we went directly to the adobe. The docent used pictures of the owners for help in describing the rooms that we passed through, the furnishings, and who used them. The parking was adequate on a Saturday afternoon. There is a gift shop, and my wife purchased an item to give her brother for Christmas. We had a very enjoyable visit. I would recommend this attraction to friends.",tbm210
50,A Hidden Treasure: Beautiful and Fascinating!,"We SO enjoyed our visit to Rancho Los Alamitos, tucked into a quiet neighborhood near Cal State Long Beach. The ranch and gardens sit on 7.5 acres, all that remains from a much larger land concession in the late 1800's. The are has been occupied since 500 AD! We started our tour with the Visitor Center and its beautiful Rancho Room: the maps, stories, and pictures are facinating for all ages. Half of our group fell in love with the restored, early 20th C. barns and all of the livestock present; the other half was fascinated with the Ranch House! Contained within the enlarged structure is the original, small 1800 adobe house!All of us fell in love with the expansive and peaceful gardens. For the Seattle-ites on this visit, the cactus garden and the native garden were the most unusal; the huge, towering bamboo plantings were great! We ended our visit in the gift shop, which is full of especially lovely local gifts and artwork. A very special place.",baroqueroundtheworld
50,"Peaceful, Beautiful, Historic","We actually were there in the summer 2012 with a good friend.It is in a very hidden location surrounded by fine homes & a golf course.There is a tour by the wife of the last owner. She is still very young.There is much to learn there, I think, of the ignored basic realities of life.",Janetta S
50,Interesting and FREE!!!,"This is a true treasure in the Long Beach area and it is FREE!!! In today's world, that is almost impossible to find. It is in a gated community near Cal State Long Beach, but there is easy access at the guard gate and free parking. The docent led tours are very informative, but you can just wander the many gardens, barn and stable area on you own. The visitor center has a short movie that gives good background on the Rancho and the area. The area is so peaceful, you don't even realize there is a freeway close by. The gift shop has very unique and interesting gifts that relate to early California, rancho life and the flora of the area.Rancho Los Alamitos also has special events throughout the year. Check their website for operating hours and special events.",hbchick
40,Local History,"Tucked away in a residential neighborhood next to California State University Long Beach this Rancho is one of two in Long Beach. Our docent led tour was very informative about the history of the Rancho and the local area. New visitor center, gardens, stables and the home are worth a visit. You can also arrange to have lunch for a group. Good for kids too.",Mojov
50,So Beautiful and Historic,"I love to come here when I'm a little blue and walk the garden paths. It is so peaceful even when its got lots going on like today. Several tour groups were being shown around by the knowledgeable docents but still the paths are beautiful and peaceful. If you walk through the cactus garden you will come across the stream that still runs through the property, cool and clear. A place to draw energy from and feel the presence of God.",Mary D
50,Love this Peaceful Place,Looking for something to do with your family or parents? Come visit RLA and enjoy the beautiful gardens and animals. The visitors center is beautiful and they have a wonderful gift shop. We booked a family luncheon which was delicious and reasonable cost. This is a wonderful place to have your business or club come for an outing. Make sure to call in regards to opening hours because of various special events. They have great programs and family events which are mostly free to the public. I love walking to this place just to get away from the city. This is a non profit organization..so I always bring loose change to place in the donation box. This is a must do and see if visiting Long Beach.,Trails4GMZ
50,History and a Glimpse of Old California,"This is one of the few truly historic and nice homes in the area that is still standing and in very good condition. It is lovingly maintained by the organization that operates it and keeps it open to the public. The fee is small. There are tour guides who will bring you through the estate/rancho and they will tell you so much about the families that have lived here as well as how the rancho began. The tour will include the surrounding gardens, as well as the house interior and exterior. It is furnished with many of its original pieces. The tour will also include the yards and the rancho workshops. The Los Angeles area seems to have lost so many of its historical buildings and landmarks but Rancho Los Alamitos is still here and it has so much to reveal about how this multi-cultural region of the country began and grew.",Observer333
50,An important part of California Heritage,"Off the beaten track and not well publicized. My wife found it on the web and we had a quiet weekend to visit.This is an old California treasure. I don't know that it will have alot of appeal to non Californians. We've lived here for years and as a history buff, I found the place fascinating.The house is a wonderful time capsule. The gardens have some surprising plants woth examining. The barn and the animals will make every kid ( and a few adults) feel all warm and fuzzy.Make sure you go early as parking is limited",ianbeavis
50,Historic Home and Mature Garden Tour,"Do not miss this fantastic treasure of California history. Varied terraced gardens, barns, and tour the grand home. The guides fill you with interesting history lessons of this area and the Rancho, Take time to enjoy a stroll through the gardens, the newly restored barn with a history room and 15 minute video, and end your with a visit at the wonderful gift shop.",bonbuild
50,Great family outing full of history,"Great place to take the family, one of the original Ranchos of early California. Newly restored buildings, milking parlor, barn, this beautiful old house is a real treasure.",Dangerouskurvz
50,Nice little place,I went here with my son and my baby and we all enjoyed it. The gardens aren't really huge but they were a good size for a 7 year old. We did do the tour which took about an hour to get through which was a little long for us. But really nice stables and things like that. It is a great place to visit and the bonus is it's free.,Kelly P
50,"Near The Beach, up the hill, and you're there!","A summer 'field trip' led us up Bixby Hill to this historic ranch. What's left of Rancho Los Alamitos (7.5 acres) is just a fraction of the original land grant, but there's still plenty to see and explore.As a first time visitor, we signed in a the Rancho Center and told to begin our journey in the History Room and later proceeded to Rancho Room where we gazed upon a beautifully painted floor mural of the rancho boundaries. We passed on the 15 minute video and opted for a guided tour instead.Best to wear comfortable foot ware as there is a lot of ground to cover in and around the ranch house. Our informative docent pointed out the key aspects of rancho life and were fortunate to be there days after a 'baby' Shire horse was born. Being vis-a-vis with these magnificent animals is truly amazing....they are very TALL, strong and beautiful!Tour continued into the adobe ranch house where no photos are allowed as I would guess to preserve the original artwork and period furnishings. Phones were also turned down as a courtesy to the docent. Seeing everything as it was gave you a taste of what life was like in the early CA days.The self-guided tour of the gardens is not to be missed. Seeing the variety of plants, tall palm trees and cacti is a photographer's delight so don't forget a camera!It's no surprise this hidden oasis surrounded by residential homes is on the National Register of Historic Places. Located on the southeast corner of The Beach, it's definitely worth a couple hours of your time!",Shimadog
50,A Hidden Gem in Long Beach,"I was looking for somewhere to take eight of my friends on a ""mystery"" day trip. I had typed ""gem in Long Breach"" on my google search and, voila, up popped Rancho Las Alamitos! What a wonderful surprise nestled in a gated community. Who would think? I was born and raised in Long Beach, well aware of the Bixby family, but never Rancho Los Alamitos. The film, the personal tour of the house and out buildings by our docent, and wandering the beautiful gardens was so enjoyable. We are all amateur photographers and Rancho Los Alamitos is full of ""photo ops""! If you are in the area, it is a ""not to be missed opportunity""!",Kathyjune
50,Life back in the day,The peace this rancho emits is amazingMany activities for kids and adults alike History abounds from the minute u step into the grounds,maryl49
50,Beautiful Grounds-Insightful Local History,"The rancho is an important part of our local history, being one of the original socio-political structures of the colonists (as opposed to natives). When I took our two youngest sons (ages 6/9), the docent gave us a wonderful personal tour through the rancho buildings and agricultural facilities all containing artifacts.",LGB-Local
50,Hidden gem near Long Beach State,Beautiful old Banyon trees beg to be photographed while hidden spots throughout the gardens beckon to be discovered. The wonderful cactus garden is next to the delapidated tennis courts that were damaged during extremely heavy winds several years ago. It's an old hacienda with a wonderful history and a stroll through the gardens transports you back to another era.,Pat T
40,Great escape in the city,"This is a great escape for a couple of hours. Hard to believe your in the middle of a big city. It's a peaceful look back to a simpler time. Take a book, stroll, explore and relax. Great for kids to slip back into history too.",YR-LGB
50,For history buffs,"Although much of the property was being renovated when we visited yesterday and the activities on hold, the house tour with Joyce was terrific. It was nice to learn about Long Beach and area history and the Bixby family. Beautiful gardens. Free admission and worth a visit.",Sandman3858
50,Unique and well done,We really enjoyed the tour of this ranch and strolling the gardens. All main living areas are well preserved with many belongings and are fully accessible. There is a garden of nearly every type and all look good even in off seasons. The compound has the largest of many varieties of cactus that I've ever seen - many 10+ feet high. And FREE is an amazing price!,CH200
50,Like a walk back in time !,"The history of Rancho Los Alamitos parallels the history of Southern California.In 1878, John Bixby leased Alamitos, moved his family there, and began transforming the worn structure into a home. Their descendants gave the house, gardens and six barns to the City of Long Beach to maintain and develop as a regional historic and educational facility. The Rancho is magnificent, and the tour is a true history lesson for all ages. You're on your own for the garden tour, with lovely plantings. The barns, farm animals and horses are an added plus to your visit here. I loved the Belgian draft horses, ancient farm equipment, and a walk through the wisteria-lined arbor near the barn. I lingered for a long while in this lovely place, and as late afternoon shadows fell, I truly felt transported to another time.",sandytravelbug
50,Beautiful historic ranch and gardens,"Rancho Los Alamitos is a lovely, relaxing place for an afternoon getaway - and an added bonus is the rich,local history you'll learn. The site of the ranch has been occupied since the times of the Native Americans. When ever I visit I feel refreshed as if I've been away on a short retreat.The adobe house, the barns and gardens have been lovingly preserved for all to enjoy for free (though donations are accepted).Docents (volunteers) guide you through the house and barns. Guests are able to roam the gardens on their own.There is something for everyone to enjoy. A tour through the house is like stepping back in time - as if the family has just gone out for the day. ""Footprints"" from all owners through history are evident in and around the house.The barns include a working blacksmith shop and a collection of mild-mannered animals including sheep, goats, chickens and Belgian draft horses.The gardens include trees over 100 years old, a rose garden, Oleander walk and a cactus garden. The view of the front lawn with the huge Moreton Bay Fig trees is breathtaking! It is a very relaxing, peaceful place to spend some time in - away from the noise and rush of the city surrounding the site.The Rancho is located on a hill in the midst of a gated community. Don't let the guard gate intimidate you! During tour hours just tell the guard you want to visit the ranch and he'll give you a parking sticker for the car and up the hill you go.Rancho Los Alamitos is located next to CSULB (California State University of Long Beach) and is open for tours Wed - Sun from 1-5 pm.I highly recommend you check it out - you will not be disappointed!",Adventurer26419
