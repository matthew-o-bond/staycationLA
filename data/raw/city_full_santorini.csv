30,“Able bodie only especially if from a Cruise Ship with limited time!”,"If port is busy please allow plenty of time to re-board cruise ship, we were there Aug 2014 & cable car queue was 2 hours long in 80plus degrees! We thought we would take the short cut & walk down to the Port easy yeh! Well no, it's slippery and dangerous, you have Poor Donkeys to contend with & there is no turning back once you are on this very dangerous slippery path., this distance would normally take 10 minutes to walk down took 1.5 hours at the bottom were people who had slipped & broken bones & some Suffering with exhaustion!!!"
30,“Archeological ruins”,We were on a cruise ship and visited on our own. The town is way up on a rim of a volcano. To get to the town you three choices a tram which we took and costs 5 euros one way. If you have difficulty with heights you can either walk up or take a donkey ride. We opted to walk down but you have to be mindful of the donkeys and their droppings. It is a switchback walk with a wide stone walking area. We also took a bus to the archeological museum cost around 3 euro. It is an enclosed area shows you where the ruins were located. They have some artifacts and other artifacts hve been removed.
50,“...from before Christ to modern times...”,"Santorini Island are the perfect place to spend with friends a holiday week! Being sailing we've really lucky to find a place in Marina, but worth a lot. Visiting the ancient city Akrotiri, Fira with all its lovely restaurants and boutiques and the unique city of Oia with painted walls and roofs in strong colors."
50,“Santorini a must see place.”,Santorini is a beautiful Island surrounded by blue seas.The people are very friendly and happy .Enjoyed our visit greatly.Amazing place for photos.
50,“Marvelous island”,"We were in a cruise and one of the stops was in Santorini.the ship stood in the middle of the sea and we had tenders to go to the island. Then we took a funicular tomgo to the top. And there it was! The island I heard talk about since I was very young, it is a city on top of a hill with a wonderful view os the ocean and the houses hanging out on the cliff.There a lot of streets with stores that sell local stuff and also a lot of restaurants and cafes.The most wonderul thing is just walk arround the small city!"
50,“Exotic Santorini”,"We went to Santorini in September 2013I always plan a trip without a travel agent . We set all over the internet.Sometimes find a lot of experiences where what is depicted on the internet is not always equal to the actual conditionswhen we plan a trip to Santorini, we stay at the hotel in the town of Fira (Thira)on the internet we thought the hotel side of the road, but actually most of the roads in Santorini stepped up downso we had to lift the suitcase up and down. but it all paid off with a stay at a tiny artistic and comfortable hotelI've done a lot of traveling, a lot of cities I have visited.Basically all offer views of the city is almost the same. Buildings, beaches, museums, and other tourist townbut Santorini is really different.for me at this time Santorini is ""The most beautiful place in the world""Santorini is a city filled with exoticism. very beautiful, extraordinaryI uploaded pictures that will tell you a lot about exotic Santorini"
50,“Santorini Greece”,Very beautiful place . Quite & calm & clean. One can take excellent photos.scenic beauty is excellent. You have to walk a lot.
50,“A Greek paradise ... never to be forgotten!”,"Our NCL cruise stopped for a day in Santorini ... a place I've always wanted to see! We viewed the island for several hours with a stop in Oia Village where you could walk the steps for hours & hours with your camera (and we had two). We shopped, had a delightful lunch & shopped more for some wonderful trinkets ... I believe our best fotos will be from here (except for our 6-days in Venice). Each Greek island is so different but the architecture here just calls to you ... and begs to be photographed again & again. This is a beautiful place & the people are very friendly. We decided to ride the tram but watched many walking the steps & riding the famous donkeys down the hill. We will never forget this beautiful island paradise."
50,“SANTOTINI IS A WONDERFUL ISLAND”,I visited Santorini at date 09.07.2013. I went there by ferry from Rethymno at Crete. The distance of the sea trip was 100 kilometres and took 3 hours. The ferry was very fast with a speed of 27 knots. The ferry went in to the nice Thira port. Santorini is located in the south Aegean Sea in the Cyclades group of islands. The view of the Santorini caldera is fantastic. The nature on the island is very fine and special. There are no rivers only volcanic rock. The island is the site of one of the largest volcanic eruptions in recorded history. Santorini is a small island with only 15500 inhabitants. Thira is the name of the capital of Santorini. There is one small air port with2125 metres in lenght. The air port is civil and military air port. NATO has a military base at the island. On the island are many nice villages with white fine hauses. For 3000 year ago there was also the Minoan civilization. The standard of living was in these days on a high level. Go to Santorini it is a very fantastic and romantic island. I am sure that you will like this place.
50,“Fabulous Island”,"I found Santorini to be a wonderful holiday destination. It is not a place to go if you are looking for much in the way of excitement or nightlife though. It can charitably be described as ‘basic’, a rough-and-ready island that is extremely friendly, laid-back and peaceful.We took a Thomas Cook holiday from Birmingham. The flight takes approximately 4 hours. Due to a general Greek strike on the day we flew, we were delayed in the air and the pilot had to circle the island a few times. For this reason I discovered that you are better sitting on the port (left) side which gives you a great view of the island and the caldera as you approach. We stayed in Perissa on the south-east edge of the island and our coach transfer took half an hour or so, but the island is so small you won’t spend much time stuck on a coach wherever you stay.Due to the Greek approach to building (which sees them stop in the summer months) there are many part-finished buildings all over the island. This ‘island as a building-site’ look detracts from the prettiness of the island, but given that Santorini is a rocky, volcanic island then ‘pretty’ is probably not an adjective you’d use for the place anyway.The island is a small one and you can travel from one end to the other on the local buses inside an hour. Buildings are concrete-built and usually adopt the standard Cycladic colours of white and light-blue. Since there is a limit of two storeys on building height, there is none of the big hotels or tower-blocks you see spoiling other tourist locations.Public transport comes in the form of buses which all go to and from the capital (Fira). I didn’t use it so can’t comment. Lots of people – locals and tourists alike – use the three-wheel quad-bike things which buzz recklessly all over the island. Leave a car for a day or so and you will find it covered in a fine coat of wind-whipped Santorini dust.The weather when we stayed – mid July – was uniformly hot and sunny but extremely windy. The wind is a major issue in Santorini, especially on the East side. On the one hand it kept the temperature bearable, but it is no fun having to hold things down all the time. At times you could barely hear the person talking next to you. We were told that it was unusually strong whilst we were there, but I noticed all the restaurants we used had taken to clipping down their tablecloths, so they were clearly used to it. One tremendous upside to the island’s windiness and generally arid climate is that we encountered absolutely NO MOSQUITOES or any other flying insects! After a late summer holiday in Corfu one year when we had to hide under the sheets at night with all entrances firmly shut, doused head to toe in repellent and still bitten to death, I cannot begin to tell you what a joy this was. You could sit out late into the evenings and sleep with all windows open – tremendous! For this reason alone I would be prepared to put up with the wind.The people of Santorini are typically Greek; extremely friendly and helpful, but their pace of life is unrushed, so be prepared for that. Food is varied, with fish and tomatoes amongst the island specialities. A typical evening meal for two with starters, main course and drinks cost me around €30."
50,“A wonderful experience from Santorini to Thirasia Sunset”,"Having been to Santorini (Kamari) several times we were loooking for some new adventures. Our hotel owner told us about a new trip which had never been tried before, after reading the details, we decided to give it a go and I'm so pleased that we did...Our guide, Marcus, put this trip together using The Bus Travel Company. Marcus is the most enthusiastic guide you could ever have and Thirasia is a wonderful Island to see the sunset. The trip involves donkeys to the top of the island (although that may change) a walk through the most authentic greek, totally unspoilt village and then a healthy walk down the other side, passing caves built into the mountains until you come across the most beautiful church and a tiny winery. We were met there by Thirasia's 'Pope' who explained through Marcus, the history of Thirasia. We then ate souvlaki, olive bread and drank some wine while we watched a wonderful sunset (you could alomost touch it). We were then driven down to the port where we sat in a wonderful taverna whilst we waited for the boat to take us back. A truly memorable experience and one I would totally recommend. I would say you need a reasonable level of fitness (as in, don't do if you have trouble walking) and trainers or walking shoes. If you have an adventurous soul and want to try something new, please contact Marcus on mkyr1975@gmail.com or the Bus Travel Company and ask them about the brand new trip that Marcus started on Sunday 14th July...you won't regret it....."
10,“Santorini Airport Departure is Chaos!”,"When departing Santorini by air, get to the airport early - two hours minimum. We arrived with an hour and a half to takeoff and almost didn't make it. Counter queues are unorganized herds with people cutting in front. Ignore the staff who try to get you to check your carryon while you are queued up. Keep your place in line. Departing is a very aggravating experience overall."
50,“Santorini Island day tour”,We sailed with the St Louis Cristal boat to Santorini as one of the islands on root. We were taken from our boat with smaller vessels to the island. There we had the choice to travel with the cable car at a cost of 4 euro or on the donkeys for 3 euro. As our time was limited we chose the cable care. This island give the feeling of kleen and calmness. Lots of shops selling WHITE close. They are so white that they heart you eyes. It is worth it to walk through all the alleys as you get the feeling of the island and the locals.
10,“Nice scenery but the locals see tourists as fair game.”,"We travelled to Santorini in 2002 with my elder parents and 3 children. It was a hot and very sunny day and due to the steep steps we entered a cafe/bar for a cool refreshing drink. The owner suggested we try a local delicacy which none of us liked (there were 7 of us) and we left most of it in the glass; we opted instead for a round of Cokes. When we asked the owner of the bar for the bill it included an astronomical price for the local delicacy. We questioned why we were being charged this extortionate price especially as we didn't drink it but the owner was rude and demanded the money. During our stay we mentioned this experience to other bar owners and they all thought we were in the wrong and were also rude.Stay well away from this place, the scenery is nice but the locals see tourists as fair game."
50,“Activities Not To Be Missed While in Santorini”,"If you happened to visit Greece and the Greek Islands are famous throughout the world with the magnificent island of Santorini is probably the most famous of them all with its unspoilt villages. To me, Santorini is a visit that not to be missed as the sunset over the caldera is such a breath-taking and mesmerising view that one will never forget. After all, getting to the island is easy and convenient as there are many daily domestic flights from Athens and it only takes 45 minutes to get there for those who do not fancy ferry.Getting around the island is simple as there is a choice of car or ATV rentals or simply opt for the efficient and comfortable public bus service in which that was exactly what many tourists and I did for most of their trips as it can be clearly seen by the crowd at the bus station. The bus station is conveniently located in Fira and it goes everywhere on the island at predetermined regular schedule (The public bus schedule http://www.ktel-santorini.gr/). In fact, the ATV rental is pretty reasonable too as it only cost Euro 20 for 12 hours usage (8am – 8pm).One may need a total of 5 days minimum (anything days less may not provide the real Santorini wholesome experience) and that I was exactly what I did. I spent a full day in Fira town centre strolling along the cobblestone pavements exploring the various shops that offer a range of items to suit different shoppers’ interest; from classic and modern jewellery and accessories, leather goods, fashion wear especially the ancient pure white Greek apparels, souvenirs, local products such wines, vinegar, virgin olive oil etc.An experience not to be missed in Fira town centre is the stroll down the 588 steps to the old port to have a feel how it was done before the donkey rides and cable cars came into action. The donkey ride cost Euro 5 per way whereas the cable car is Euro 4 per way. Many opt to walk down and took either the donkey or cable car back to the town centre as climbing the 588 cobblestone steps is not an easy task. Decisions of whether to take the steps, donkey ride or cable car have to be made before leaving the top or bottom of the 588 steps as changing your mind mid-way may not be permissible since the donkey or cable car stations are located at either end, the town centre or at the old port. Nevertheless, not sure if I had taken the donkey ride was a good idea since it is a very strenuous and tedious tasks for the poor donkeys to go up and down the 588 cobblestone steps under the hot glaring sun but if no one pays for the ride, where do the owners get the money to feed them?!On a another day I took the public bus to Oia, one of the foremost tourist attractions of the Aegean Sea and it only cost Euro 1.60 per way from Fira. Oia is famous for its sunset in which is considered by many as one of the most beautiful in the world as the view of the sunset against the background of Oia is a real WOW effect. For those who wish to go and watch the sunset, better be prepared that the busses going and coming back before and after the sunset are usually very pack.I also took the opportunity to visit Akrotiri too, in which is famous for its red beach to spend an afternoon there besides visiting the prehistoric town of Akrotiri (Entrance fee is Euro 5 if I remembered correctly) and the bus ride costs Euro 1.80 per way from Fira. On the way to Akrotiri, I also stopped by Megalohori village, one of the traditional settlements in Santorini; it is a beautiful village with white cubic houses in narrow alleys and it has a large number of local wine tasting wineries.Of course another beach not to be missed is the black beach, Perissa to spend either a full day or half a day there and while you are there, visit a shop facing the Perissa beach that sells well-designed and good quality leather sandals besides other leather goods. Did not take notice the name of the shop but one will not miss it as it is located right at the beach front. As Perissa is located slightly a little further as compared to other destinations in Santorini, the bus ride from Fira costs Euro 2.20 per way.Last but not least, another activity to be experienced while in Santorini is the walk from Firostefani to Fira. Firostefani is a village that is located about 800 meters next to Fira and comparatively it is much quieter in its tourist activities but it is the picturesque magnificent caldera view at the rim to the sea down below and afar volcano that is really worth the walk.Even you may not be a wine drinker, a must try local wine is the Vinsanto Red Dessert Wine that is made from sun-dried grapes. Looking for good food is another experience especially all-time favourites like the Fried Calamari , Greek Salad that goes very well with the local vinegar and olive oil besides the must try Souvlaki – popular Greek fast food of small pieces of meat and sometimes vegetables grilled on skewers."
50,"“Auto for You, Fira”","I recently had a very good experience with a car rental agency in Fira on Santorini. I found them on the internet - possibly on Kayak - and reserved on line. The manager, George, was very responsive in dealing with my reservation and the car was ready when we arrived.We rented a nice little Kia Picanto for 38 euro per day and the mileage was very acceptable. We explored the whole island for 20 euro in gas. The agency is centrally located about 1/4 mile north of the Fira town center. I would highly recommend them."
30,“Santorini O.K. for one expensive night”,"Yes it's picturesque but it's mostly down hill from there. The restaurants are over priced pacticularly any with a hint of a view. It is also very busy and booking a table is recommended. We love Greece, it's people and islands and Santorini would be the last on our list to revisit.For a laugh out load holiday read we recomment Adjacent to the Argonaughts by Julian Blatchley - brilliant."
50,“Getting around Santorini”,Rent a smart car to get around the island since the streets are pretty narrow.
20,“Good city but racists.”,"I love the scenery of santorini, but I hate to be discriminated. from 4nights trip in santorini, only 1 restaurant treat me fairly.We're asian, but doesnt mean I cant buy luxury in the world. and I dont like spending money at a small island full of racists."
50,“Mediterranean Cruise”,"Rented a car here and did the island on our own. Explored the red and black beaches, saw Oia and Fira. Opted to ride the cable car to the top and not the donkeys. A beautiful island."
50,“What a View”,"The view is what matters in visiting Santorini Greece. If you do one thing - upgrade your hotel so that it is overlooking the Caldera. Would strongly recomend a hotel in Firostefani which is a 10 minute walk to the main town of Fira. It is quieter, there is only one walking path and the main road is close to the hotels as compared to Fira - not so much walking to your hotel with luggage and it is easier to find your hotel. Lots of excellent restaurants within minutes of all hotels in Firostefani with beautiful views - especially sunset.Recommended hotel is the Belvedere and restaurant is Mama Fira across from the Belverdere.You will be amazed by the view from your balcony"
50,"“Unique, magic, expensive”","Santorini is more than just another greek island. It's a place you must visit. A geophysical phenomenon with amazing view, great architecture and lot of things to do. The two major towns, Fira and Oia, have everything except the beaches. Nightlife, good hotels, great view to the volcano, restaurants and everything you want to buy. From jewels to souvenirs. In Fira, trips are starting every day from the old port to different destinations to the island. Also it worths the visit, Franco's bar (classical music) and Koo and Enigma for clubbers. In Oia, see the sunset, visit the Atlantis bookstore and the bay of Ammoudi for good fish and lobsters. Perissa and Perivolos are the major beaches of the island with plenty of bars, but you can also visit Kamari (handmade pasta in sunshine restaurant) and the hidden beach of Eros near Vlychada. Visit Akrotiri for a sense of a typical village and the lighthouse on the edge of the island. Taste the local wine(vinsanto) and the specialties (fava, tomatokeftedes, kapari) . You will need a vehicle (plenty of car rentals) and no more than 4-5 days to see everything. You can save money in many ways but if you want to live it to the bone you might want to pay some more money.And you can always stay in one of these great villas with the amazing views and the pools."
50,“Fira to Oia”,"Our recent cruise stopped in Santorini for the afternoon and evening. After a few hours in Fira we took the bus to Oia. Any of the locals can give you easy directions to the bus station ,where the schedule is posted and was accurate. For 1.60 Euros,per person one way, my husband and I traveled to Oia in less than 1 hour. The ride is through a scenic highway, curving over the ocean.Oia is as beautiful as the pictures we have seen of this area. The people were friendly, the views from the local restaurants were breathtaking . Another great day in Greece!"
50,“Santorini is magical”,"I'm writing a review about NST Santorini Travel and the Santorini island. We didn't see much, but Thomas, our local tour guide, took us to the local beach called the Red Beach on the other side of the island. The beach is just beautiful, not what we expected; clearly something different.Thomas also took us to Vin Santo winery where it has the most breathtaking vista of Fira, the ocean, and island. Santorini is dry, crowded, but unbelievably romantic. Everytime I look at the pictures, they reminded me of something so dreamy, hypnotic, and spell-bounding. By request, we also wanted to see Oia. Oh my God, he took us to this cafe where the chairs are overlooking the sunset. Unfortunately, it was cloudy, so not a lot of sunset, but we did enjoy frappes and raki.Thomas is so flexible with us, and he made our day in Santorini so memorable. Our first cruise destination made us want to come back to this island again."
50,“Heaven on EArth”,"Not knowing much about Santorini, I was surprised by its magificent beauty and its friendly and vibrant atmosphere. The island offers great food, an opportunity to get comfortable and relax in an environment that caters to your needs, and provides some of the most outstanding shopping for select, luxury items one can find on vacation. My family and I enjoyed laughter, meeting new people, tasting interesting dishes, and can't wait to return to experience what Santorini will offer next."
30,"“Car Rentals in Santorini, be careful !”","Renting a car is a necessity if you have limited amount of time and you want to see the Island, but you should be aware of some smart ideas. Buy travel insurance and pay extra to remove or reduce your excess. Car is usually delivered almost empty, so don't make a mistake like we did and fill it completely, we left it more then half full, no refund for this. Check the car thoroughly for dents and scratches, take a photo or video, date stamped for you records. Be very careful because the roads are a disgrace for a busy tourist destination (lots of ditches). Be vary of other road user especially motor and quad bike riders and English, Australian and Japanese drivers( they drive on the other side of the road at home). Take extreme care at night on the roads (lighting is minimal). If you want to use credit cards for fuel check before they put fuel in your tank. It helps if you speak Greek when you ask for directions. Tourism is the main income of the island yet they treat tourists with contempt.Just one other thing. Paying at restaurants by credit card. Check before you order if they have this facility to save embarrassment. We had a great time, however we witnessed a few eyebrow raising situations. Have a great time."
50,“Santorini- You have to see it to believe it!”,"Santorini is surreal, hypnotic and a place- right out of fairytale books! Look at any side, any corner any view of this gorgeous island and you will feel GOD has Art directed every frame and that’s how it is possible for a place to be so beautiful and picture perfect!I have seen Santorini in many pictures and movies and wanted to visit this island at-least for the past 10yrs. So when it came to taking our annual vacation it was an obvious choice.We visited in the first week of May and it was just mid season, making things much cheaper and affordable. The days were warm and sunny yet not very hot like the Greek summers are described to be. There were a lot of tourists around but it was not crowded and made sightseeing more enjoyable. The nights were cold but not freezing. A stole, shawl or single jacket was enough to make me comfortable.Santorini has 3 major parts. 1: FIRA- very touristy as most visitors prefer staying here. Fira is the largest and by far the busiest town on the island. It is made up of alleys and streets filled with hundreds of tightly packed shops; selling jewellery, clothes, artwork, ceramics, souvenirs, ice-creams and what not. It is the party place of Santorini and people who want lot of action and a busy night-life should look to Fira. 2: IMEROVIGLI- 2kms to the north of Fira and just 10 minutes from Fira. Imerovigli is a beautiful and quiet village. The area has many hotels and typical houses. There are also some nice taverns. It faces the volcano and offers an incredible view of the sunset. The best way to explore Imerovigli is parking the car at the car park and walking up the cliff. There are many cobbled streets and blue or white- washed stairs. The village is full of gorgeous houses in blue, white with just a dash of cream, yellow and ochre. Its lovely just walking around and letting all the sights sink. 3: OIA- is about 11kms from FIRA. To me Oia is the most beautiful of all the villages that I have seen not only in santorini but all of Greece. Oia is situated on top of an impressive cliff and offers a spectacular view over the volcano of Palia and Nea Kameni and the island of Thirassia. Oia is a traditional village with charming houses in narrow streets, blue domed churches, and sun-bathed verandas 2 gorgeous windmills and plenty of tourist shops, taverns, cafés etc. Oia also has a small port, Ammoudi, reached by a set of 300 steps leading down. There, small boats can take you opposite, to the island of Thirassia. We took a day trip to palia and Nea-kameni followed by a lunch at Thirassia. Oia has sunsets that are not only magical and romantic but so out of dreams that it is a lifetime experience to see the sun melt into the santorini ocean.All in all Santorini is a small piece of heaven. This place is really out of a storybook! The time we spent at Santorini was like being in a beautiful dream that i wished would never end. If you are visiting Greece- santorini is a must visit."
20,“Vistited Santorini awhile ago and found the island quite stunning to look at and”,Visited Santorini awhile ago and found the Island quite stunning to look at and be part of however I was so disappointed with the food we were served each night in so many different restaurants. The problem for us was _ the island being volcanic there are little homegrown vegetables Frozen mixed vegs. After a couple of nights we were so fed up. Anyone else found this problem!!!
50,“Very romantic island”,This island is amazing! perfect for couples. it's very romantic.I definetelly suggest it to anyone who wants to visit Greece.The only negative is that the seas are not so perfect as these of other Greek islands but the plase worth the visit.
40,“Experiencing an island - Greek style'”,"I had heard a lot about the Greek Islands so a chance to visit Santorini could not be missed. The clear blue seas and skies and near perfect weather conditions added to the overall experience.I had read that the isle is over run by tourists. Hey, but I am a tourist too, right? Well maybe we picked the right time to go, it wasn't yet ""season"" and no place was over crowded.Renting a scooter was the best thing we did. We could ride wherever we wanted, take picture stops and enjoy a glass of wine when the moment felt right. We went up to the highest point of Santorini, where the monastery is located. En route we stopped at Pyrgos, a lovely traditional village. A stop at Santo wines which produces the Santorini Wine and is one of the oldest wineries in the world was a great experience. A local wedding was taking place there and we saw the bride and the groom having their pre-wedding photo shoot, just before the guests trooped in!The Volcano tour in my opinion is a 'must-do'. Where else will you get to walk up a volcano so easily. And if you wear sensible shoes its not difficult. (Despite the numerous reminders a young teen was wearing four inch heels..no wonder she didn't get off the boat later!) The organised tour may appear expensive but the company of a well informed guide makes it worthwhile!The climb to Oia was steep ...260 (or was it 280?) steps. But I trust my two legs more then the local donkeys! Of course my contention is that they weren't donkeys at all but ponies!The small island definitely depends only on tourism, but I still feel its a trip worth making."
50,“Somewhere you should go before you die!!!”,"This place is second to none in every respect. People here can communicate English well. Its scenery is magnificent!!! Never seen something beautiful like this before in my life and I'm sure that'd be hard to beat it! Food is good and various, what can be more perfect than having nice dinner and watching awesome scenery at the same time. Accommodation are mostly nice and various to demand. REALLY UNMISSABLE!"
50,“Captian Teds Sailing trip was the best day of our vacation”,Eight of us took a private day long sailing charter with Captian Teds and loved it. This is the best way to see Santorini. The crew was professional and fun and the food was amazing. If this trip doesnt relax you nothing will!
40,“Postcard perfect view !”,"Been dreaming of seeing the postcard perfect view but a bit afraid if the place only means for honeymoon. Just back from my backpack trip last March 2011.As Santorini Island as one of the destination really luv this place. In March the business is a bit quite on the island but this time around will be perfect it you dont like bit crowd & things is cheaper around this time. Most of the shop is being repainted & refurnish during this time, it also nice to see them doing it. There is still shop for you to look around if not as many as in summer.Sunset in Oia Village is a must! Enjoy Mum's cook restaurant as well.What you see from the picture of Santorini will be the same as the actual view! Just dont ask for blue color rooftop & white color building place to see as almost every where is blue color rooftop."
40,“Very Beautiful Town”,It was very worth seeing city and one of the most beautiful views I have ever seen. There is not much to do in historical sites and this small village can be done in a half a day.
40,“amazing views”,"There is not much to do in Santorini but the views that you get are truly wonderful. The images that you get while in Pyrgos or some of the other small villages are typical of what you you see in tourist magazines - white structures with blue roofs. If you are there on a sunny day it is magnificent.If you are arriving or departing from the port of Fira you have three options for getting up to, or down from, the top of the hill - cable car (definitely the easiest), walking (the slowest) or by donkey (the scariest)."
50,“A Fantastic Holiday in Santorini ..”,"A truly magnificient Holiday destination.....That's Santorini....!!! An island of Greece , , it's approach is great. ! You arrive by a catamaran and you can see high on top , the quiet village of Santorini in the distance, all cute small houses perched on the huge cliff side , seem almost ready to fall...!!!! Once you get off the vessel , take the road to the top , and WOW !!!! What a view ...!!!! It's absolutely Fantastic , and the pretty little villages , with their cute blue domes atop the sparkling white - washed hexagons, against the light blue sky , and pretty red bougainvilla creeping on the white walls... It's all sooo magical , and a Must - see spot.... It's also amazing to see the way the houses and hotels are built right on the cliff side, and the rooms are cave type , with curved roofs and lovely balconies to have the morning cuppa tea... It's beautiful ....."
50,“The Best Place for Your Honeymoon”,"My wife and I love to travel and we picked Santorini as our Honeymoon destination and we will never regret it. This island is the most stunning land structure we've ever seen. The people are so friendly, the climate is perfect, the food.. well you just can't stop eating it! Wine is good, the villages are terrific and the views are spellbinding from everywhere on the island. If you get the chance take an ATV around the island and see it all. We stayed on the island for 5 days after visiting Athens (another equally wonderful place). There's tons to do in Santorini, so give it atleast a few days because it's a magical place!"
50,“My favourite place in Greece!”,"I went to Santorini in summer and it was definitely one of the best places I've been to. 4 days and 3 nights is definitely not enough! I stayed in Perissa area and the black beach was amazing! The sea and sunset were beautiful! Architecture and Houses? One of a kind! Be sure to visit Perissa, Kamari, Oia, the volcano, take a swim in any of the amazing seas, take a tan, and drive around! I would definitely love to go back to Santorini again!"
40,"“White houses, amazing view: A relaxing piece of land.”","Unlike the tourist-tainted landscapes of neighbouring of Cancun and other Caribbean resorts; Santorini, Greece provides a seemingly untouched backdrop of white hills, red beaches and blue seas.A gem of Santorini, the Traditional Houses, sits high atop the archipelago of islands in the villages of santorini. Houses are divided into studios (one bedroom), maisonettes (loft bedroom), and suites. Each lodging has its own intriguing name — presumably derived from local occupations — such as artisan, boatman, collector and antiquarian.The luxury dwellings are carved out of pumice and designed to blend in with the surrounding architecture — hence “traditional houses”. The theme of bright white with a highlight of blue windows, roofs and shutters create a mesmerizing effect when pared with the Aegean’s cerulean waters and red clay cliffs.Beyond the intricately detailed infrastructure, the Santorini White chalets have become for the romantically-inclined, offering a full service honeymoon package, with champagne breakfasts, flowers, satin sheets and the works."
50,“Beautiful Wedding”,"We got married in Santorini in September 2010. We used Kivotos Travels to coordinate our wedding day from Seattle. Our wedding coordinator, Maria Renieri was fantastic in making our wedding day a beautiful and memorable one! The setting was absolutely breathtaking, and all the details of the ceremony was perfect! We had 14 guests and they all enjoyed themselves immensely. We had our wedding reception at Sphinx which we highly recommend. The food was excellent and the staff was very nice. Also, don't skimp on the photographer. You MUST go with Antonis Gianellis as your wedding photographer. He costs a bit more since he has to travel to Santorini from another island, Rhodes, but he's SO worth the splurge! We wouldn't have changed one thing from our wedding day in Santorini!"
50,“Wedding in Santorini”,"It was only after much research - and sixteen years of living together - that Mary Ann and I opted for getting married in Santorini and using Kivotos Travel there as our organisers. We were quite concerned to 'get it right', even though it was the second time for both of us and we were doing it in secret - without any guests. We needn't have worried! From start to finish, over several months, Kirsty from Kivotos managed everything perfectly - both flexible and gently directive as the occasion demanded. Everything was organised in timely fashion, our endless questions answered promptly.The chapel, Profitas Elias, was beautiful in itself, as well as offering exquisitely romantic location, high on the cliff overlooking the Mediterranean. The timing - just before sunset - also romantic, the right temperature and with beautifully soft light for those photos! Kirsty and Maria were elegant and attentive witnesses, and the Registrar both suitably solemn, yet with just a touch of Basil Fawlty behind the immaculate white suit. The music, champagne, cake, flowers, confetti were all tastefully and thoughtfully put together.Kirsty also helped with finding our lovely little hotel in Oia - Alta Mare, to which we shall undoubtedly return. Delightful room, a marvellous 'infinity' little pool inside one of the old cliff caves, delicious breakfast on the patio looking out over the caldera - and unfailingly excellent and personalised service from the Manager and all of his staff.In fact, it was all just perfect - as we had hoped.David, East Sussex, UK"
50,“Paradise Town”,"Absolutely a paradise town, we fell in love with it right away after tendered from NCL Cruise Ship. You can choose take the cable car up there or riding a donkey for about 500 steps, since the town is located on the cliff top.I suggest to rent a car even the island is not very big, you can get to more attractions by renting a car than taking the local bus, 1 reason is the bus' turn over schedule is kind of long, 2nd reason is renting a car is not as expensive as expected (20-40 Euro a day), and you can request to return by dropping off close to the pier and leave the key somewhere inside the car, they will arrange to pick it up themselves."
40,“A great island where you can spend several days.”,"Santorini, also called Thira or Thera, is a very nice remote island in the Aegean Sea, in Greece. It is a volcanic island which is essentianly what remained after an enormous volcanic explosion. You can read more about Cyclades (a group of islands which comprises also Santorini) on the wikipedia.I went there with a girl friend in order to spend a few days together to relax, sunbath, swim and escape the city rush.Imagine Santorini as Ying and Yang. The West side of the island is called Caldera and it is a moutain like, rocky area with a lot of traditional terrace suites, restaurants, markets, a small harbour, clubs and some pubs. By contrast, the Eastern side is at the sea level and is very quite and you can watch the stars by night or have a swim.Usually the pictured you see, with Santorini, are those with the classical terrace houses ""sculpted"" in the mountain’s rock from Caldera area. Here, we have visited two towns called Fira and Oia. If you want to watch the sunset then you should go to Fira and make a reservation to one of those nice restaurants.A lot of people going to this island want to stay in the terrace like suites in this rocky area (Caldera). There is a bit of a contrast here. There are some ""private"" luxury suites with private pools, sunbeds on the terraces and room service etc. and some which are a little bit to traditional. In any case you will not get to put you feet on the sea water when you leave your suite as you are somewhere at 220 meters up on the mountain cliff. Of course you can take a car and go to the Eastern side in 15 minutes.We stayed in the Eastern side of the Island in a very nice remote and quite place. OK, maybe it was to quite but I really enjoy it. All of the East coast is a long beach (which is not very sandy because everything is made from volcanic rocks, remember!?) but it is very nice to swim and sunbath.We rented a small house, which was brand new, with two floors. At the ground floor there was a living area with a fully equipped kitchen, a TV set, a sofa and a bathroom and at the first floor, there was a king-size bed, a bathroom with shower and a very nice balcony from which you can see the beach and the sea. This house was situated 25 meters from the sea, on the beach. We paid 130 Euros per night and in this price was included a small car (Daewoo Matiz) rented so that we can go and reach the other parts of the beautiful island.This house is a bit to remote because if you want a glass of water in the middle of the night you have to go by car to the airport and by one.I really enjoyed a town called Kamari. situated in the Eastern side (also at the sea level ;) ) where you can find a lot of nice suites with private pools, nice restaurants, clubs - even karaoke -, markets, pubs and places where you can drink a glass of wine, have a chat and enjoy the view and the music.The overall experience was great and the view is indeed unique!"
50,"“Spectacular Santorini, Greece”","My wife and I just came back from Santorini, Greece last month, Sept. '10. It was the most picturesque place I have ever seen in the world. Everything was so beautiful and the 2 main towns there had a very cozy feeling. We loved all the little shops and cafe's on every corner. Oia was so beautiful with all the white houses and blue roof tops. I definitely recommend going there sometime soon and can't wait to go back."
50,"“Village of White and Blue, Santorini in the Greek Islands”","We just returned from a fabulous trip to the Greek Islands aboard the Costa Fortuna. Our stops included Katakalon/Olympia, Santorini, Mykinos, and Rhodes. Each Island was very unique starting with the very ancient Olympia saturated in age and history on the site of the first olympic games, then Rhodes which was also full of ancient walls, beaches, city life and history. Mykinos was just plain fun enjoying a meal in a local taverna along the waterside and sipping on Ouzo while watching a spectacular sunset. But the pictures tell all when you arrive in Santorini. From the moment you go up to the mountaintop villages (like Oia Village), you are spellbound by the shades of white and blue. The houses and building structures are predominantly white, some with blue dome roofs accented by beautiful blue skies and overlooking the blue sea. Many structures built into the side of the mountaintop, make for interesting views as you walk through the little village filled with shops and tavernas. You definitely need to stay overnight to really enjoy the area to its fullest. The people were very friendly and tour guides were very knowledgeable. We were there on September 23rd and the weather was ideal. We highly recommend a trip to the Greek Islands especially to folks who have never been overseas from North or South America and want to get their ""feet wet""."
50,“My favourite place in Greece!”,"Just gorgeous the village of OIA was just beautiful. Santorini has amazing wineries, black and red sand beaches. We had a great time riding mules up to the top of the village from the port of Thira.This is a touristy town but the views of the Caldera and very greek looking village of Oia make it the most spectacular of the greek islands.This is a perfect place for honeymoons and weddings and somewhere you won't soon forget!"
50,"“sunset, wine, people-- amazing beach destination”","my boyfriend and I spent 3 days in this city, and we had the most amazing vacation experience here. People in Greece were super friendly, a jewelery guy spent 2 hours fixing my 6 euro necklace for free!I strongly recommend the boat trip, although not being a big fan of hiking on the dead volcano, the sunset on the boat is simply beautiful and amazing. I love all the greece wine as well. They have a huge selection of sparkling and sweet wines, which are just my favorite kind.All in all, would like to visit again if possible"
50,“Best vacation ever”,"So, I will confess that I am a girly girl. Especially on vacation. My makeup, my perfume, the whole nine.My boyfriend and I flew to Athens the day after the liquid terror scare in 2008. The airlines lost my bag for our entire ten day stay in Greece.It was still the best vacation of my life.Santorini is beyond gorgeous. The entire island is 10k feet above sea level, our hotel was on a cliff overlooking the caldera, and I want to go back so badly I ache. Besides the beauty of the setting, the food was amazing, the people were unexpectedly tolerant of our crazy American selves and you can just feel the history and the sense of awe that you should feel when faced with such a beautifully perfect place.I would go back again in a HEARTBEAT."
40,“Santorini Sunshine.”,"Returned from Santorini recently, having spent seven fun filled days, in the glorious sun, as a solo traveller.The island is Volcanic and small, compared to other Greek islands.As a tourist, there is not a lot to do, except soak up the sun and indulge ones self in the excellent healthy Greek food.For sheer spectacular views one must visit the capital Fira and Oia on the North tip. In Fira there is a Cable Car down to the harbour, unless one wants to ride a Donkey down instead. not recommended. Both towns have have an abundance of shops for the ladies, offering some very good art objects.On the outskirts of Fera there is a Vineyard well worth a visit, especially as the host is very knowledgeable.Apart from that, maybe a trip to Red Beach where there is an inlet of water that is actually coloured red, due to the composition of the surrounding earth.As the island is small the best way to travel around is by a very efficient local Bus service. Any where that you want to go only costs 1:40 Euros.I stayed in a place called Kamari which suited my needs of beach and an abundance of restaurants.My hotel was the four star Anassa, very central and throughly recommended.A quick run through of restaurants and bars in Kamari.Cafe Dolce, my favourite people watching place. Good for snacks, drinks and hospitality.Lolos Traditional Greek restaurant, up the back streets but well worth the effort to find it as the food was excellent.Poseidon, on the sea front. Excellent service with Fish and Lamb to die for.The Boat House, on the front, not to be mistaken for the hotel of the same name, excellent food cooked by the owners wife.Byzantio, just off the front, tasty but I do not like slivers of bone with my Lamb.Almira at the end of the front, good on all accounts.Nichteri, central front, top class, highly recommended.The one and only Irish bar, very good hospitality and reasonably priced beer.The Groove for live music, when the band shows up, over priced beer.Just For Beer Bar, good variety of beers but again over priced.Would I return to Santorini ? yes but next time with my partner, as I thought that I was the only single person there."
50,“Beautiful & Relaxing”,"I've traveled to a lot of places & this was the MOST beautiful place I've ever been. I loved the hotels built into the cliffs, the great views & sunsets, the black sand beaches & easy public transportation to get anywhere on the island. It's only a 30-min flight from Athens. Stay 3 or more days, so you can see all the beaches & sights. If you want night life, stay in Thira town. If you want romance, stay in Imerovigli & I recommend Artemis Villas."
40,“Greece and the idyllic Greek Island of Santorini”,"This summer, I visited Greece for the first time ever. What I was really looking forward to was the beautiful scenery that I had seen in typical Greek pictures: little towns made up of blue and white houses located on the top of a cliff overlooking the water. I visited Corfu first and found it quite disappointing. It (along with many of the Greek islands) is what I would call the Caribbean of Europe. It is a wonderful place to relax but for a North American like me to travel all the way to Greece and just lie on a beach chair under a straw umbrella seems like a waste. The island is beautiful and there was much of it that I did not see, but in my opinion, if you're going to see Greece and experience Greek culture, then Corfu is not the place to go. Santorini, however, was absolutely amazing. It was what I had pictured. I stayed in Perissa Beach, which was nice but Oia, which I visited for a day, was amazing. It was one of the most beautiful places that I have ever seen, and there are many cute shops with fantastic local artwork on display. I also visited Athens for a day. I found that a day was the perfect amount of time to be in Athens. I saw all the historical ruins that I wanted to see and other than that, I did not think that the city had much to offer. Visiting the Parthenon and all the ruins is pretty amazing though (if you like history and/or old architecture. Definitely go to the Acropolis Museum when you're in Athens because the museum holds all the statues etc. found within the Parthenon."
50,“Beautiful Coastal Paradise in Greece”,"My husband and I just returned from a Mediterranean cruise for our honeymoon. We visited Mykonos and Santorini, Greece, Istanbul and Ephesas, Turkey, and Sorrento, Italy. By far our favorite ports were in Greece, specifically Santorini. Upon arriving to the coast we saw what postcards have been boasting for years, only more majestic than a photo can portray. An exotic paradise with bluish-green water, white sand, and adorable white buildings with blue roofs welcomed us to the port.While in Santorini we toured an active volcano and swam in the hot springs. The views we had at the top of the volcano were amazing; like nothing we had ever seen before. Swimming in the Mediterranean Sea was an adventure that we'll never forget. After touring the volcano and seeing some of the history that Santorini had to offer we decided to head up the cliffs to see what all the blue roofed buildings housed...and of course do some shopping!We could either hike up the cliffs, ride up on donkey, or take the cable cars up. We went up in the cable cars and got to take in more of the beautiful scenery. After a long day of volcano touring, hot spring swimming, and donkey dodging we took a load off at a cute rooftop patio for a cold drink and a Greek snack. Who knew that cold cucumber dip, also known as tzatziki, could taste so delicious?After a few more hours of walking the cliffs and shopping for the perfect souvenirs to bring back home we were spent. We headed back to our ship loving our day in Santorini and planning our next trip back when we could spend more time in this lovely town."
20,“Beautiful place to watch the Sunset!”,"We visited Santorini in July, everyone had warned us it would be hot but coming from Florida, it really wasn't much different!Things to know if you are arriving by Ferry: The buses are to the left of the dock and get full fast. There's really no order to loading or lines so be prepared for the rush! The city of Firo is EXTREMELY touristy! All of the cruise ships that dock there drop off their customers at Firo. The Firo dock has three choices to get up to the town, by donkey (stinky, slippery, scary and messy) walking (DITTO and very tiring!) or by gondola. Spend the $5 euros and wait in line - you'll be glad you did! Spend a short period of time in the shops, but plan your trip out of this city. Very expensive, all the stores sell the same thing, and the food is not great. Get on one of the buses and stay out of this city if you want to experience the real Greece!"
40,“My Favorite Greek Island... Santorini!”,"Recently my friend and I visited the Greek Islands. Our adventure started when we landed in Athens from Vancouver, BC.Canada.From Athens we flew Olympic Airlines, which won awards for 2010, to Crete, where we stayed for 4 nights in Chania, a quaint Venetian Style Port. Our Accomodations were with the Doma Hotel which was originally built in the late 1800's as the Australian Embassy, later it was used as the British Consulat and was occupied by the German's during the war. The owner, alovely lady who was born in this house gave us a wonderful welcome and lots of history! We then took the ferry to Santorini,Wow what a beautiful Unique Volcanic Island. The huge volcaniceruption in 1956 was the worst natural disaster in recorded history. The towns of Fira and Oia were so picturesque with the buildings fitting right into the side of the volcanic calderas...the winding streets and the many lovely shops were great to explore.The sunsets amazing! Everyone was so very helpful and friendly there, well I must say all of the people of Greece were very hospitable to us.From Santorini we took the FlyingCat ferry to Mykonos where we spent 3 more days enjoying the beaches and the excitement of a lively little island...The Piano Bar is a must to visit. The Taxi's just fit through the tiny windy streets.We very much enjoyed our Greek Island Adventure.Gayle,White Rock, BC Canada"
50,“My favorite aegean island”,"one of the most beautifull and interesting islands in the aegean sea.whatever you type of vacation be sure you shall find your niche in santoriniThe sunsets are out of this world, the gourmet restaurants ( and there are many ) are world class, the conference centers have nothing to envy, one of the best music studios in the world is located in Santorini.the beaches are not like the caribean ones but are crystal clear and quite warm in august september and even october in most years.archeology wowowowowo dtons of it and some of the best preserved prehistoric archeological pieces are shown in the museum which were excavated at akrotiriwine wowowow wineries galore for the most ecclectic tasteNight clubs open till the wee hourshotels there is everything from the 5 + stars to the cheappests they are all beautifull. there is something for every pocketI just love it"
50,“Love the island”,"Santorini island is one of the most known cyclades island. You will love the island. The best way how to expolre the island is rent a car for couple day. For best beaches head to east part of the island. Perissa beach or Kamari beach is your bet. For sunset drive to Oia. And the main town ""Fira"" is packed with overpriced restaurants and two superb Archelogical museum."
50,“The most mystical and romantic place ever.”,"Santorini is one of the famous Cycladic Greek Islands. Pictures of Santorini are used in most publications used to advertise Greece. You know the pics of the blue sky and white washed buildings....this is Santorini. It is a beautiful island with many facets.Thousands of years ago, Santorini was called Strongeli (meaning round in Greek). In the middle of this island was a volcano which erupted and basically split the island in half. One half remains, the other half sunk killing many people and sending a tsunami across Europe. It basically wiped out a civilisation in Crete!The island that we visit today has many areas to enjoy. Fira is the main town. This is where you enjoy the gorgeous views of the caldera, visit the many boutiques and shops selling anything from designer labels to traditional wines and sponges of the region or visit one of the lovely restaurants or clubs. There are many various places to stay and of course the closer you are to the caldera (the famous cliff edge) the more spectacular the views and of course prices of hotels. Be warned however if you stay in one of these hotels, be prepared to walk up and down many flights of stairs to get to your room....no there are no lifts....so if you can't handle stairs your better off staying away from the caldera and there are ample of hotels that can accommodate you minus the stairs. In Fira, you eat, drink, shop and party. There is no local beach here. You need to travel to Kamari, Perrisa or Perivolos (main beaches) for a swim.Kamari is about a 10 minute drive from Fira. It is a seaside spot with about a 500 meters of tavernas, shops and restaurants facing the black pebble beach lined with umbrellas and sunbeds. This is a friendly spot and great for families as well as couples and singles.Perissa & Perivolos is a 2 kilometer stretch of beach with black sand and lots of cafes and restaurants, beach bars and taverns. It is where the camping grounds are for backpackers and has a vibe at night to suit the young at heart with live and loud music. Perivolos is where the famous beach parties happen as the sun sets in the summer months. Expect lots of sun kissed skin, loud music and lots of dancing around this time.Oia is famous for it's sunset and has beautiful shops and restaurants. This is a spectacular place and peaceful for those of you who like to lay by the hotel pool sipping a drink without the sounds of bikes, cars and people around. It is very serene and romantic and recommended for honeymooners and those who need some peace and quiet. Warning....at sunset it is very busy as most tourists during their stay will visit Oia for the 'famous' sunset. The quaint streets ain't so quaint during this time!!!! Amoudi is the seaside port where you will find the fresh seafood taverns. This is down the cliff at Oia. It is wonderful down there and if you love seafood and authentic greek live music...this is where you will find it.I spent many months in Santorini and experienced a love affair with the place that will never end. I would be more than happy to assist anyone with their travels there or as I did, advise anyone who wants to live there during the summer months like I did."
50,"“beautiful sunsets, quaint towns, friendly people”","Stayed at Hermes Hotel in Kamari, clean, friendly staff especially ""Ettie"" on reception. Went with a party of 25 for a wedding which was fantastic, the best views and sunsets that you could ever imagine. The island was quite pricey but you pay for the views. If anyone is wanting to get married abroad Santorini is the place to go."
50,“10 Day Greek Islander - Amazing”,"My wife and I just got back from a 10 Day Greek Islander including Santorini, Mykonos and Athens through Gate 1 Travel. Gate 1 was exceptional in providing very detailed information and intinerary throughout our entire trip planning beforehand as well and in each location. The representatives from Gate 1 in Greece were very friendly, spoke excellent English and were more than willing to go out of their way to assist us.As far as Santorini, Mykonos and Athens....they were all so beautiful and can't wait to go back there again.I would definitely recommend Gate 1 Travel to all of our family and friends in the future when deciding on a travel agent or internet search for vacations."
20,“Don't get ripped off in this tourist trap!”,"Santorini is very beautiful although overrun by package tours and cruise ships. WATCH OUT if you rent a motorbike; the shops in Thira have a racket going where they rent mechanically defective vehicles but have you sign a form contract first that says they are in ""perfect"" condition. Then when they break down you will be extorted for the repair costs. The local police are worse than useless, they are likely related to the shop owners. Especially avoid Skouras A. Mixanl, tel 6945 628885."
50,“Cruising the Eastern Mediterranean”,"We have just returned from a cruise leaving Venice to Croatia, Turkey and Greece. A few words of advice follow.Venice in September is still crowded, but the enchantment is there due to cool breezes, even a little rain at times and well, you are in Venice! Prepare for chaos at the Venice Marco Polo airport--especially departiing. You can not check baggage more than 1 1/2 hr prior to departure. Lines for check in at Lufthansa were 1 1/2 hours! To travel the city of Venice purchase a ""people mover"" one to three day pass and get on and off as desired. You can go to Murano this way easily.Finding a reasonable hotel in a good location is a challenge. We did our research and were lucky! We stayed at the Edelweiss Stella Alpina Hotel just two streets (actually alleys) up from the St. Lucia train station. One should pack especially light for Venice as the only bridge from the Piazza Roma where the public bus or private shuttle bus from the airport drops you is high and challenging even to the fit. Avoid the fellows at the bottom of the bridge who offer to carry your bags for 5 euros as they have been known to run off with them according to locals. This hotel is clean and comfortable, though there was no lift for our third floor room and each floor has two landings! The room had a good air conditioner, and the decor was pleasantly quaint. Don't leave the windows open in Venice as the mosquitoes can be vicious even in September as evidenced by our cousin's feet and ankles! No signs of bed bugsat this hotel--it was very clean. Great breakfast also, and a very accomodating staff. Buy authenic Italian goods in Venice--don't be decieved by the many Chinese merchants peddling look alike glass and leather wares.!On to Dubrovink--ridiculously crowded due to the cruise boats. We took a taxi to Cavtat, a seaside town about 25 miles away. Very relaxing, with a few shops and restaurants.Likewise Turkey was crowded with tourists, though Ephysus and particularly the Ephesus Museum were worth it. We found great food down near the water, but the prices were ridiculously high--almost 200$ for lunch for 4 people. The Turkish vendors pester you mercilessly while you are shopping and act hurt if you will not look at their menus or goods. I found shopping here for quality goods trying at best. Several rug shops represent schools for nomad tribes and were professional with good quality merchandise.The jewel of the trip was Santorini! Take the donkey ride or the cable car up the mountain to Fira, then head to any of the various dealers who rent scooters and all terrain vehicles. They are safe,cheap(16-30 Euros for the day), and the perfect way to tour the entire island. The larger ATV we rented did well up the hills on regular roads, through the vineyard roads, and down to the black sand beaches (which are partially topless). All the little beach side cafes in Kamari were friendly with excellent food. Try the Greek salad and the grilled sardines. Thatched umbrellas and lounge chairs with tables can be rented on the beach.The restaurants serve you complimentary wine at the end of the meal. The buildings in Santorini are all white with blue trim. Every view was spectacular with water in every hue of blue you could ever imagine. The shopkeepers were friendly and reasonable. The whole day was unforgettable."
50,“Jewel of Cyclades islands”,Santorini is a volcanic Greek island. Is not a usual holiday destination. Is a fairytale blue-white place where you can spend a wonderful times. The most frequented places are litle village Thira and Oia. In this villages you can wander along beautiful little streets. From village Oia is a most beautiful sunset. I recommend you to rent a car and see all this Island. You will nicely surprice.
20,“What a rip off this island is”,"I have just returned from Oia in Santorini and I must tell you that the island is just a licence for the businesses to print money.The prices are outrageous and it felt like the smiles were only for the Euros. Where is the Greece I know and love so well.I have travelled and lived in Greece and I know the country very well. I am always sad to leave Greece and whilst I am there I am always well treated. The Greeks are lovely people and so kind and hospitable but NOT SO ON SANTORINI. I couldn't wait to leave and I was only there 3 days.Greek tourism has taken a big hit this year due to the economy. The rip off mentality of these greedy individuals who run businesses on this island will do more to harm the reputation of Greek tourism than any strike. Eventually it will be a case of killing the goose that laid the golden egg.The Calderra View is amazing. The best views are from the sea. If you take away the view, the island is not attractive and has little to offer, so my advice is stay on the boat. Visit more beautiful islands such as Lesvos or Chios or anywhere but Santorini."
50,“Coooooool”,"The views from the top of the island are simply stunning!I didn´t quite like the main land and the villages, they were pretty dirty. But the touristic parts are very nice and the views are gorgeous. Apparently a few centuries ago a chunk of the island shrunk in the sea and that´s why its shape is so sharp.The donkeys were funny! You could travel on a donkey from the shore to the top part of the island, instead of going by car. I didn´t do this, so no idea what it´s like. But they were cute :)"
50,“WEDDING SANTORINI ( KIVITOS TRAVEL)”,"My husband and i were married in santorini on the 8th september 2010. Our wedding planners who we chose were "" WEDDING SANTORINI"" ( PART OF KIVITIOS TRAVEL)Maria renieri was our wedding planner and we couldnt have chosen better than this. We took alot of time choosing the right wedding planner and spent quite a few weeks researching to find the right one which we evetually did in choosing wedding santorini and the wonderful staff. ( Maria, Kirsty and margarita. )Maria was very quick in replying to our emails and basically keeping me very calm via this. I had no idea when i first paid our deposit in 2008 what to do next ( and the wedding wasnt till 2010, but maria told me i neednt start making plans until 3 to 6 months before....so i was chilled from that day.It did help that we visited santorini and staff at kivitos travel in october 2008 and was able to look at the locations available to ourselves and decide where we wanted to be married.I wasnt nervous at all on the day as maria and kirsty made me feel at ease ( and maybe the few glasses of champayne i had before helped me too)! Maria will try and accomdate you in any way she can, she is always there for you.We chose saint irene for our wedding venue as the previous place we had chosen was not available, but it worked out very well as we thought saint irene was just perfect and the picture oppotunities were much better for our photographer.I had a hairstylist and make up artist included in my package and they really did work wonders, my hair was just how i had imadgined it to be... and my make up was beautiful, although she had a job on her hands as my face was a little red from the sun, but the lady really worked wonders on my face and toned it down very well.It was a lovely suprise to find at the ceremony that we had champayne flutes with our names on and the date of the wedding, which we will cherish forever.If you are considering getting married on this beautiful island, i really would reccomend maria and her staff, nothing is too much trouble, and at times i felt i must of been asking her some silly questions ( being a first time bride you dont know what to expect)but honestly maria does not mind at all.In fact there is only one problem that we have...... and that is that we want to go back to santorini and do it all over again!Thank you Maria and your wonderful staff, one day SOON we will return to santorini... and we truly cannot wait!Please keep up the wonderful work of making peoples dreams come true.xxxx"
50,“Things You Need to Know About Santorini and Which Location to Stay in”,"Santorini is absulately a beautiful island. Before we came here we didnt know which part of the island is best place to stay.We got very lucky with our choice. We stayed at Above Blue..Tip (when you are searching for hotels, if you are looking for a hotel on the cliff, make sure that hotel is on the cliff.On the some of the hotel website pictures lt looks like hotel is on the cliff but in real it is not on the cliff..It sees the water from inland. Also dont assume all the hotels has pool, some of them dont.)There are few different locations you can stay, almost all of them have beautiful views..First decidion you need to make is ""do you want to stay on a cliff hotel or beach hotel""Hotels are on the cliffs has breath taking views.Most of them has small pools and jacuzies but no beach...Hotels on the beach still has views but nothing like cliff views..You will be just looking at the Agean sea , since beach hotels are other side of the island you have no views to Caldera (means no views to all those small islands and volcano).One side of the island (west side) ,all on the cliff, other side is on the beach level.Cliff side towns are Oia,Imerovigli,Fira,Firostefani, Akrotiri..(those are the ones I can think of).OIABetween all of them , I think town called Oia has the best views. Oia is a very unique town with a lot of hotels on the cliff or not on the cliff. This town looks little quiter but a lot of people come to visit..We didnt see any clubs or bars playing loud music..There are restaurants and coffe shops, and there are also some shoping..Hotels in Oia are the most expensive hotels..If you concerned about money, if you dont want to spend more than $400 per night and if you want the have Cladera view for sure, I would suggest other towns, they have beautiful views also..you wont regret it.If you are kind of a person want best of everything, means, best view, best hotel and have the money definately stay at Oia..Or you can stay in a hotel no views will be cheaper..FIRAFira is the capital of the island..Fira has beatiful views as well from different angle. Fira has a lot of restaurants, a lot of cafes, bars, clubs, shops, trafic, cars etc...If you stay in Fira you can just walk to those attractions..This part of the town is not as quite as other towns...Fira has very nice hotels with views as well..If you are younger, like to party I would suggest to stay Fira..Hotels in Fira little bit cheaper than Oia..and they have beautiful views as well if you get a hotel on the cliff side..IMEROVIGLIWe stayed in this town..very quite and smaller part with beautiful views as well..There are very few restaurants and coffe shops ..There are a lot of nice hotels in this section, since we stayed here , we walked around and looked at the other hotels..I would say best hotel in this section is Grace, Above Blue,Dreams Luxury Suites, maybe Icons (didnt really see inside the hotel), and another hotel I dont really remeber the name but maybe called Honeymoon villas..FIROSTEFANIFirostefani is the town next to Imerovigli..this town has the same views as Imerovigli..and nice hotels as well..not many restaurants, very few..AKROTIRIAkrotiri is opposite side of Oia..has beautiful views as Oia ..This town is very close to beaches and has hotels on the cliff..When you compare to other sides of the island , as a town not as pretier ..but beautiful views..W drove by and hotel Avant Garte has the best views in this location..Originally we were planing to stay at Avant Garte (we flew in with no reservations) but taxi driver didnt know where the hotel is thats why we went to Above Blue which is owned by same company..If you are not renting a car or motorsicle, I will recommend you to stay in Oia, Fira..since you can walk to all the attractions.If you are renting car or motorciyle you can stay at any locations..This was our first time in Santorini, I tried to explain as much as I saw..hopefully it will be helpfull."
50,“The most beautiful place in Greece.....”,"Small town which place 600 metres above sea level with beautiful name Fera. Artist, painter, musician comes here for inspiration. The small, thin street with white - blue houses, where people living and smile all part of tourist. If you want come to Santorini you can take a boat or ferry, arrive here in the morning, walking in town, visit each small street, and have a rest in nice restaurant. And of cource you should see the sunset in Santorini island/"
50,“Most beautiful place to go ! Dont miss it !”,"This is such an amazing place,Dont miss the sundowns and the great views from Fira, Imerovigli and Oia,TAke the boat tour to the volcano, take a swim in the hot springs (don't wear a white bathing suit )You have to go to the red beach and to Caldera viewRent a Carits fun to get around and if you get lost, you are never faryou can tour the island in one hour !Have fun, enjoy the viewsthere is a picture perfect shot at every cornerIf you are a couple, go there for your honeymoon."
50,“amazing place for couples”,"Beautiful, very romantic, we climbed up a volcano, swam in the hot springs, ate fresh fish.Down side: very expensive. you have to bargain. If they say 50 Euros, say 30 and you will end up paying 35!!!"
50,“Loved it”,"It has been a longtime dream of mine to visit Santorini. And I was not disappointed. We took ferry from Mykonos to Santorini. The views before ferry entered Santorini were breathtaking. After reaching the port we transferred to our hotel by bus. First you need to take the bus from port to Thira and then from Thira to different parts of Santorini. Thira, Oia, Perrisia all places are worth spending a day. Also, we took a volcano and hot spring tour for a day while we were there. We totally recommend this tour. I recommend spending a week in peace at Santorini and exploring the little villages and towns at leisure."
50,“Santorini - breathtaking scenery”,"Visited this piece of paradise on a recent sea cruise thru the Med. Fira, the capital is accessed up a zigzag track or cable car up the steep cliffs to a height of about 1000 feet above the sea. Majestic views from the town which is perched on the cliffs. Beautiful and typical white Greek buildings which can be seen from a distance. Good shopping, restaurants etc. Oia which is pronounced Eea is at the Northern end of the island and I consider to be more beautiful than Fira. Wine tasting at Santos Wines is also a pleasant place to visit and would have the best views in the world for a winery. A visit to Santorini is a must for anybody visiting the Med and the blue of the sea is simply wonderful."
50,"“Imerovigli, Santorini Review - July 2010”","Santorini is one of the most spectacular places in the world and is matched by equally amazing weather. The island is actually part of a volcano: an archipelago of five volcanic islands orientated in a circular shape surrounding a dramatic deep blue ocean lake. Santorini was originally a single island but an enormous underwater volcanic eruption some 3500 years ago, resulted in the creation of geographic calderas which has the affect of a jaw shaped layout that encompasses a rectangular shaped ocean inlet. The earths crust sank letting the sea in and it is said that this caused a tidal wave that ran across Crete, just to the south, and somewhere the Lost City of Atlantis comes in !Santorini is situated in the southern Aegean Sea, located 130 miles south east from the mainland of Greece. The west side of the island has steep volcanic cliffs, which constituted the crater wall of the volcano, and the view from there is simply stunning. The eastern side of the island is more gently sloping and this is where the major beaches are located. The sand is black, volcanic and slightly sticky in consistency!ClimateSantorini enjoys a mild Mediterranean climate that enjoys year round agreeable conditions. For July when I was there 90F degrees (30C) and clear just about sums it up although its not quite as simple as that. There is always a welcome breeze, which sometimes develops into a definite wind – the island is known for its winds. Night times cool down nicely. There is a definite heat haze that can impede the views for photographers like me but when the wind is stronger, and first thing in the morning, it is much clearer and quite unbelievably beautiful.Apparently it hardly ever rains here and, after a few days, you may ask yourself where the water comes from? The answer; its pumped from underground and delivered to hotels in tankers! Its rather hard, ok to wash with, but best to drink bottled water. When I was there in mid July I asked when it last rained and the answer was “I think it rained in May”!TourismThe main industry is tourism and the island is well geared up to deal with the most demanding of tourists – yes its very popular with Americans both as a tourist destination and as a port of call for the many cruise ships that call in here. The cruise ships disembark at Thira (Fira) port and the lucky cruisers have a choice whether to take a donkey ride up the winding pathway to the main town hundreds of feet above, or to walk it in the sweltering heat avoiding the herds of crotchety donkeys and of course their “evidence”. The alternative is to cheat by taking the cable car but there is a downside to this too as you have to wait in line when times are busy.Thira, the main town, is busy and very touristy with lots of tiny pedestrianised streets to get lost in. It is very safe; the people (including the traders) are all extremely friendly. There are many jewellery stores and tavernas where you can eat the local food. There are other busy centres on the island but there are also places where you can find peace and tranquillity. English is almost universally used as the main language for tourists.Oia (pronounced “eya-aa”) is the most prosperous settlement on the island; here the walkways are made of marble! It is said Santorini has the best sunsets in the world and they are best viewed from Oia. I would have to argue with that – the sunrise I saw was certainly beautiful but could certainly be bettered from the north coast of Cornwall, for instance? But its turned into a bit of a `must do` tourist thing and people go and congregate and applaud when the sun dips below the horizon!Getting aroundI was told that Santorini is a small island and there is absolutely no need to rent a car while you are there. Wrong ! Yes it is a small island, and if you are the type to just relax and do very little, stroll a bit, maybe wait an hour for the local bus, then maybe you don`t need transport. But if you are of the type that likes to explore and discover stuff for yourself, then you definitely need transport.There are a few choices. The island is brimming with car, scooter and ATV rental businesses but the cheapest option is to arrange it before you come here, through someone like www.holidayautos.co.uk . The `fun` option might seem like a scooter or an ATV but, and now I`m gonna be a killjoy; as a biker myself, the idea of riding an underpowered vehicle like that, unprotected, without helmet and wearing shorts, a tee shirt and flip flops, seems a bloody dangerous one to me (coming from a man who was seriously injured on a bike myself 10 years ago!) Also, you are 100% exposed to the sun. The answer is a car – I had a Suzuki Jimny (a tiny 4WD SUV) with an open top but shade if you wanted it. It was perfect. Fuel is expensive – 1.65 Euros a litre for unleaded which is as expensive as anywhere in Europe but it is a small island and you won`t use much! Just keep calm and stay clear of the motorcycles and tour buses – yes it is a bit frantic. Oh and you may well find yourself with a manual / standard transmission!And – this sounds a bit decadent – but do bring Lulu (thats what mine is called!) – your trusty GPS if it has European mapping – its great to be able to disappear up all sorts of lanes and know you are not going to get lost! That being said, Lulu has advised me to drive up flights of steps and across open fields and her excuse is she has not been to Santorini before !!EatingBecause of the arid climate and poor soil quality, meat has to be imported from mainland Greece and, in my opinion, the quality of butchery is not as high as it could be – there are often tiny fragments of bone on the cooked meat which can play havoc with your teeth! But then the Kleftico, Beef Stefado and all the regular Greek dishes are excellent.Where Santorini does score is with its fresh fish which is absolutely wonderful! To sit in a little restaurant just four feet above the water, knowing that what you are eating was landed that morning on the harbour side just 50 yards away is amazing. But then so it the enormous price – we had the most incredible meal with Red Snapper, Grouper and grilled Octopus with copious amounts of `Village` wine! The price, 100 Euros!! The cheapest option is grilled / fried squid or octopus which I love – a very healthy meal!However it is perfectly possible to find lunch or dinner for 30 Euros or so – portions are large and they are very much into sharing – you can share a local salad and a fish dish which is a nice way to eat?Also, if you take the trouble to explore a bit and disappear down unmarked tracks you can happen across tiny tavernas on quaysides that really just serve the locals, with smoky outside grills – this really is the way to get good value and atmosphere too !WineAgain because of the poor soil and dry climate, wine yields are very low yet Santorini does have a successful wine industry and thanks to all the independent supermarkets, the local produce is freely available. They say their wine is organic and without preservatives so there are `no hangovers` – I can vouch for that !It is sold in the restaurants by the carafe as `village wine` and, generally, it is not strong – 11%-12.5% but has a distinctive flavour. There is a special very sweet desert wine, which is a bit of a speciality and costs rather more because the grape content is much higher.HotelsOn the eastern side of the island, which is more gently sloping, and where all the black sand is, the hotels are more conventional and tend to be small. There are none of the regular hotel chains on the island. Kamari and Perissa are the main towns here and tend to be frequented by younger people looking for a bit of nightlife! You can eat more cheaply – burgers, pizza and kebabs as well as the local food.On the west side and in my view the part of Santorini that really does have the `wow factor`, many of the hotels are `traditional houses` – almost like caves that are built into the steep cliffside with spectacular views over the volcano and the sea. The view really does take your breath away as do the steps; inevitably there are a lot of steps and a veritable labyrinth of passageways that take you to your room or `house`!We stayed at the interestingly named Ouranos Traditional Houses (Hotel) at Imerovigli right on the cliff-side and fortunately not too many steps to encounter. There are a few `plunge pools` dotted around but no true swimming pools as such – you need to go to the sea for that. Don`t expect `5 star` luxury – you are paying for the location here and the staggering view from your private terrace. The rooms are comfortable but simple – the bed has a stone base, an `efficient` bathroom and a little kitchen with fridge and tiny stove; so you could cook something if you wanted to. And although the rooms are naturally cool and painted white to reflect the sun, they all have air-conditioning units and ours kept our room at a comfortable 65F. Breakfast is provided and is truly international – you could choose from eggs and bacon, cheese and cold meats, fruit and the traditional Greek cakes and pastries.Eastern Europeans seem to dominate the catering industry here, as they do now in the UK, so you can be assured that standards of cleanliness and attention to detail are high.Again, the town of Oia has the most exclusive hotels and tavernas but the downside is that its a magnet for tourists – the streets are crowded with people from cruise ships and tour buses being shepherded around by tour guides with hands in the air waving flags etc. Thira is also very busy although its only a 20 minute stroll from Imerovigli. We thought that Imerovigli was just right in terms of the hotel, the price, the view and offering the degree of quiet that we were looking for!ConclusionA wonderful location if you are looking for a relaxing holiday with breathtaking views, perfect weather (sun but a cooling breeze), fantastic food and local wine!"
50,“Wedding in Santorini Greece by Kivotos of Agean Travel”,"My husband & I were married June, 2010 in Santorini, Greece. Margarita of Kivotos of Agean Travel was our wedding planner and coordinated the ceremony and plans. Everything exceeded our expectations. It was an absolute EXCELLENT experience. Every photo on their website was true to life from the location of the wedding down to the flowers. I even feel it was more beautiful in person. Kivotos of Agean Travel was very detail oriented. Every email was answered promptly (and believe me I sent many), every concern I had tended to. I would HIGHLY recommend Kivotos of Agean Travel to anyone planning to get married in Santorini."
50,“Dream Wedding in Santorini!!!”,"My husband and I got married in Santorini, Greece on June 26th, 2010. It was a complete dream come true and would advise any couple looking for a romantic destination wedding to get married there. It is a gorgeous island and the people are extremely friendly. We planned our wedding through an excellent company called POEMA WEDDINGS & SPECIAL EVENTS. Our wedding planner's names was Amalia Valvi and she made our special day magical. She payed attention to detail and knew how to make our dream a reality. Our photographer and videographer were exellent and the venue was perfect as well. Thank you Poema and beautiful Santorini!!!"
50,“black sand beaches of Perissa”,"We just returned from Greece and had been a little concerned that Santorini would be too touristy. We stayed in Persissa at a vacation rental right on the beach. Of all the places that we visited during the entire stay in Greece, Perissa was the best. The Greek people were very welcoming and the beach was perfect, not very crowded, clean, and close to restaurants and bars. We rented a car and toured the island, Fira was very crowded and super touristy, but still beautiful. We continued to Oia and had lunch overlooking the sea. Oia was smaller, charming and less crowded. We had a great time, and got the best of the island by staying on the beach and visiting the other sites."
50,“Thirtysomething island hopping in Santorini”,"Having never done the whole island hopping thing my wife was eager to get me to Greece to do a couple of islands Santorini was our first followed by Naxos.Santorini is a small island (in that you can easily cover it in a morning by road but its major locations take longer to explore. It is one of the higher priced islands in Greece due to its much talked about Caldera views (see pictures)Towns and area of interest are Oia, Fira and Kamari; these are the more heavily populated areas and offer the most by way of views, beaches and attractions.Fira is the main town area giving you the Caldera view from many of its restaurants, there are many jewellery shops, they are high end shops and all bar one (Triton Jewels) they are not offering cheaper affordable trinkets. In the morning you can see the mule being taken through the town which take visitors to the old port down a steep set of steps; alternatively you can take the cable car for 4 Euros per person each way. From the old port you can take a number of boat trips or visit the volcano and hot springs. The town itself is a winding series of streets very postcard perfect. Daily we would see different cruise liners arrive and off load more tourists, this can get tedious as the street are very narrow at parts and can ruin its appeal. The town has a prehistoric museum, ferry and tour operators and there are plenty of places to hire vehicles on the island (around 8 – 10 Euros per day is average for a moped) Good and bad restaurant reviews are listed separately.Oia is a town on the northern tip of Santorini, and it offers possibly the best views of the sunset, it has beautiful white marble walkways, and again a mix of restaurants and shops, tour operators and vehicle hire, we arrived at mid morning and there was very few people walking around, then by lunch we were invaded by 4 coaches of day trippers from the cruise liners, at one point one alleyway became gridlocked with people wanting to get through while others wanted to look in shops, again this became annoying, it’s a lovely place to wonder through but try and avoid the coaches.Kamari is on the south eastern coast of the island and by moped is about 20 minutes from Fira, there are not many cars on the road and visitor vehicles outnumber local by at least 3 to 1. The beach is small stones; these are not uncomfortable but get very hot in the sun. Two sun loungers will cost you 6 Euros, there are many cafes and gift shops along the beach front and the area has a very chilled out feel to it although I’m not sure what the nightlife would be like. Fira has more variety but no beach, yet with Kamari only 20 minutes away you would be best place to travel to the beach daily, buses also run to Kamari from Fira.An average meal on Santorini was costing around 25 – 35 Euros (25 would be without starters) and prices varied depending on what view you had, some of the better restaurants had no view but gave exceptional quality food, conversely some of the restaurants that had great views gave poor service, in one case, bringing the main course while we had our mouths full with our starter (Mama Thira).Travel on the island is very easy and mopeds or ATV’s are very popular and quite safe, the locals will drive much faster than most tourists and I never felt pressured to move out of the way to let anyone through, it is a small road network and as I have said before most people on the road are other tourists, and nothing on the island is that far away.We spent a week on Santorini and it was a beautiful location to be in, the people were very friendly, our accommodation gave us the Caldera view and for much cheaper than expected (see Nefeli Homes review), there is much choice if you do not want the Caldera view or would rather be in another part of the island, accommodation can be sort cheaply as many hoteliers tout for business as you get off the ferry, I would visit Santorini again but perhaps not for a week, a short 2-3 night stay might be in order next time."
30,“questions”,"i am planning a trip to santorini on the 16th of july. however, i heard that greece is on strack now. so i am quite afraid about the accommodation,the ferries and so on... is there any one currently in santorini island may share some info with me ?"
50,“Wedding in Santorini”,"Just returned from Greece, where we get married and spent marvelous honey moon) The wedding itself was organized through Kivitos travel, planned by Margarita, who did really great job! Everything was as smooth as possible and we were very happy!)"
50,“A View Like No Other”,"I recently traveled to Athens, Chios, Naxos and Santorini for 12 days, with several family members, and worked with Ender Karadas, from the travel agency named KIVOTOS OF AEGEAN. He was wonderful!!! Ender booked all our hotels, ferry travel, small plane travel, transfers at the airport and hotels, etc. There was no wasted time and everything worked like clockwork. The places where we stayed and visited were very breath-taking. We stayed at the Belvedere, and what a view. It was our first trip to Greece and he had several suggestions all of which turned out great. It was a very special trip for us which Ender understood. I would strongly recommend KIVOTOS OF AEGEAN, and Ender Karadas."
50,“Oia is what you go to Greece for.”,"Have just hit the reality of home after a fantastic and comprehensive trip around Greece and Egypt. We finished off with a week in Santorini, in the town of Oia.Although we loved everywhere we went, Oia is the gob-smacking location you go to Greece to see... it isnt on the front of all those tourist brochures for nothing!When you arrive at the airport and start driving around the island you wonder whether you have made the right choice... quite frankly that side of the island is pretty ordinary.As we passed though Fira we were also less than overwhelmed. But then we arrived in Oia and walked onto the ""main street"" which is a small marble-cobbled thoroughfare that runs the length of the cliff-side. Incredible views that just go on for the entire road had us amazed and in love with the place instantly.We did catch the bus to Fira and have a good look around and although it has more shops and eateries, it was definitely not anywhere near as good as Oia.Notably all the cruises come to the island and land at Fira only to be instantly bussed around to Oia to shop and look at the amazing views!We stayed in the Atrina Houses. I had done extensive research (esp on trip advisor) about where to stay in Santorini. I had read generally peoples raves about Oia and decided that we would look for accommodation there. They were right! It leaves Fira for dead! After much research and emailing we chose Atrina for accommodation.You will find that as there are no real maps of the towns you have no idea where your accommodation is. I found this very frustrating. Let me tell you we were SOOOO glad we chose Atrina. I checked out all the places higher ranked on Trip Advisor that we had been considering, and found them all wanting in one way or the other.Not only MUST you get a place on the caldera, you have to be careful which way it faces. Some of them actually face back towards the cliff face and other houses, not out to sea.Also be warned that the sunset is not all its cracked up to be! People pay a fortune for their property to face the sunset but in the warmer months you will be out eating at a taverna etc so its a waste of money. Also the sunsets are not that special anyway!The other thing to watch out for is that some houses face onto the street or are immediately below it so have no privacy from the hordes walking up and down the road watching you in your swimmers on a sun lounge or eating your breakfast.The only downside to our entire Greek trip was the food. It was (to our taste anyway) lacking any Greekness... everything comes with fries, is usually lacking in any vegetables and is swimming with oil.There was a patisserie there which had decent Greek pastries: baklava, galaktoboureko and milk pie. It is entered by a small winding staircase going down from the street... if you see it give it a go.Another handy hint is to find out if the restaurant lets you bring your own wine (which you can buy at the local supermarket)... it will save you a lot of money.Santorini deserves its worldwide reputation and is indeed a magical, special place. And bring your wallet :-)"
40,"“Santorini, my first vist to the Cyclades”","My friend and I Went to Perrisa in Santorini for a week and and got back on the 8th June 2010. We stayed at the Dollitsa apts and found them very basic but clean and handy for the shops,bars, beach and bus into Firo. We ate out every night and loved God's Garden for fresh fish dishes and the Atlasbar/cafe,opposite the youth hostel for breakfast and lunch,both places are fairly reasonable and you get good size portions aswell.I like the fact that no one hassles you to go to those places unlike the bars and restaurants on the beach road where all the waiters have a table ""especially for you"".The beach at Perrisa is like black volcanic ash, well it is hot ! and i'ts the same at Kamari which is more upmarket,but well worth a visit via the water taxi which is fun,but be prepared to get wet !I was a bit surprised by the amount of men and women trying to sell their overpriced stuff on the beach and found it quite annoying when all I wanted to do was relax in peace.Perrisa was also a bit noisy with motorbikes and barking dogs so I would probably stay in Fira next time which is beautiful or Oiaif i was on my honeymoon as it's very romantic."
50,“We had a great trip to Greece by Gate1 Travel's help”,"We just returned from 10-day Greek Island trip, including Santorini, Myconos, and Athens. With Gate1 Travel's guide and help, we had a wonderful and smooth trip. It's life-time memories!We booked this package from Gate1 Travel. The whole trip was planned and organized very well. For each place we arrived, there were Gate1 agents waiting for us by the gates . They transferred us to our hotels, and provided us the useful inormation for attractive or highlights in each place. They also helped us with any problems we had. For example, one of our return flights was canceled due to the British Airway strike. Gate1 Travel helped us re-booked another flight to make our connection smoothly.The scenes of Greek islands we visited are gorgeous! The hotels we stayed were clean with good service. There were variety of food for breakfast. The locations were convenient, too.We would like to use Gate1 service again in the future and I will recommend it to my friends."
40,“Private tour in Santorini”,"When visiting Santorini, Greece our group of 12 decdied to take a tour from a local guide in hopes of getting a more complete tour than those offered from the cruise ship. I was fortunate enough to come accross Dimitris from Ocean Wave Tours via the internet who arranged to have ""Gabriel"" meet us for our full day tour. We were able to experience the entire Island including a stop at a local restaurant on the water where we had a sampling of local foods and fish and wine. Our group felt that we received a very complete tour of the Island and not just one aspect or attraction. Just what we were looking for. I would recommend it to anyone."
50,“santorini greece.”,"just back from santorini greece,.santorini is the ideal location for the lazy traveller's .we stayed in self catering apartments in perrisa a small village with a lot of little taverina & souviners shop .not a sight of any british shop's or mac donalds ,just perfect for a holiday .I would recommend aripiou apartments in perissa .Accommodation is execellent &spacious .hair dryer ,mircowave ,iron & towels are all provided for guests .,towels are changed every day and the apartments are completely cleaned daily .the arapiou family run the complex & may i safe it was a pleasure to have been in their studio,a. i would recommend these apartments to every one who want good clean accommodation .4*** from me . ."
20,“perevolos santorini”,"May 2010, just returned from perevolos in santorini, the beaches are long and black volcanic. The small resort of Perevolos has nothing to offer but relaxation if thats what you want, which we did. It is a very long walk to the nearest mini market for daily essentials. We stayed at the Elitheria apartments which were clean and basic, the owners do not ineract with you at all even though they are at the pool bar all day. Not a good place to stay if you do not like to walk. The restaurants vary in prices but the best ones we found were Gods Garden in Perissa (40 minute walk) and Charlina's in Perevolos (15 minute walk) Nicos and the rest of the team are very friendly and the price is average. Overall quite expensive in Greece now and sliced loaf was 4.55 euros but the unsliced stuff is .80 cents. Thira the capital is lovely quaint streets full of jewellery shops and americans from the cruise ships. Overall a place I had always wanted to see but will not return to as did not live up to my expectations and there are much more beautiful greek islands."
40,“A Place of Majesty & Dreams”,This place really made me feel special. Even though its just a small island in the middle of the Agean Sea. The Greek Islands are truly a magical place and the people friendly and welcoming. I stayed in Home style accommodation throughout on all the islands I visited. Naxos. Paxonus; Santorini and Mykonos. This type of accommodation may not suit everyone; but is basically small villas dotted throughout the island owned by private owners; who may live next door or nearby. They provide shuttle service to the ferry and sometimes a lift into town. I just used the local buses or had my own motorbike for the duration of the island stay. Joined up with local tours for sightseeing or meeting people or met locals and joined up with them on special tour they would arrange.
40,"“A relaxing, charming little island - or (""Wind, Wine & Sunsets"")”","Santorini was a perfect choice for my partner and I in July 2009: we had seven days there and managed to strike a good balance between quiet, relaxing days spent chilling out by the hotel pool in the sun, and days spent exploring various parts of the island. So, if that's what you're looking for in a holiday, this is the place for you. The sunsets, about which we had heard so much, were absolutely worth it.(I've also reviewed Hotel Kalimera, where we stayed, elsewhere on Tripadvisor.)**THINGS I WISH I'D KNOWN BEFORE GOING**- WIND: Despite speaking to at least two couples who had been to Santorini before going, neither of them warned us that there is an incredibly windy season in late July/early August. We're talking 30mph winds here - which makes it slightly colder than anticipated, although not greatly, but has far more of an effect when it comes to things like girlfriends who have JUST straightened their hair. Something to consider when booking.- WINE: Again, despite speaking to people before going, nobody warned us about the wine. In fact, if anything, at least two guidebooks and one of the above couples actively encouraged us to try it - DO NOT put yourself through that. My usual rule of thumb is that if you've never heard of a particular country producing a particular food or drink, there is usually a very good reason for it. Santorini is, unfortunately, no exception. All of the wines we tried, with the exception of one passable rosé, were unbelievably acidic, sour, or just plain foul-tasting to the point of being undrinkable. Admittedly, I do consider myself a bit of a wine fan, but I'd honestly rather drink one of the no-brand £2.99 bottles sold in corner shops in the UK than anything available in Santorini. It is genuinely mystifying as to how the island has become ""known"" for its wine industry - which is a shame, as it had been on the top of my list of things to try. The beer, especially Mythos, is very good.- SUNSETS: The sunsets are universally recognised as some of the best of in the world, and I wouldn't disagree with that at all. But - and this is a big but - it would be a mistake to think that you will have a good view of it from any point on the island. If anything, I think Akrotiri (where we stayed) isn't a good spot - there are mini-islands in the sea which obstruct the view just as the sun is dipping into the horizon. Fira is best, being in the middle of the island - we booked a restaurant on the cliff edge and it was suberb - but Oia is also reputedly very good. Best thing to do is try to be in different places when the sun goes down - that way you can experiment for that perfect sunset!"
20,“The Blue Dolphin Hotel”,"Stayed at the Blue Dolphin Hotel in Santorini.When we arrived they were suppose to pick us up at the boat dock. No where to be found. When we arrived at the hotel on our own they tried to charge us saying they were there to get us.Absolutely untrue. Upon leaving they called a shuttle for us. We paid the shuttle driver at the airport and when we got home they had charged my credit card for the same trip to the airport. An absolutely outrageous exploitation of tourists.Also the rooms are small, old, with archaic plumbing and in need of serious updating.Would never stay there again or deal with these people ever again and would never recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Santorini"
50,“Beautiful Santorini”,"If you get the opportunity to visit the island of Santorini, Greece, you will love it...it would be a perfect place for a honeymoon, or that special occaision....when there rent a car, very easy to use, and roads are easy to follow....leave time for the town of Oua, and the black sand beaches. It was one of the best islands we have been to, the water is as blue as a bottle of listerine!....gonna go back and stay...."
50,“strong donkey”,"On the 6th day of our Holland American Roman Empire Mediterranean Cruise, we debarked on the beautiful Greek Isle of Santorini. This island was once part of a larger island before it was ripped apart in about 1450 BC by a massive earthquake and volcanic eruption about 4 times the size of Krakatoa. Santorini became part of the Roman Empire in the 9th century BC when the Dorians extended their empire from mainland Greece.To reach the hilltop city capital, Fira, you can ride a donkey about a steep stairway hugging the side of the mountain, or you can take a funicular (tram) or you could walk the path up (the same path the donkeys take). We decided to ride a donkey. My husband was hesitant that a donkey could carry him (he is not a small man), and had been traumatized as a young boy when he was told he was too heavy to ride the mule ride in Disneyland when he was 12 years old. But the keepers of the donkeys in Santorini kept on saying, ""Strong donkey"", ""5 Euros"" to him. So on the donkey he went.My daughter, who got on her donkey right behind him, felt sorry for the donkey, who took a lot of rest breaks to get up the pathway. But that was okay, because the view of the whole Mediterranean Sea that we saw from the donkey ride was beautiful. Too bad there is so much donkey poop on the path. I don't know how the people who were walking up (and down) this path could stand it, not only the smell but also slipping on the poop.My donkey, on the other hand, took off right away without waiting for any handlers. My donkey had a mind of its own, shoving its way up the path, past the other donkeys, trying to be the first one up to the city.My son took the donkey back down from the city also. He loved it because it was a wild and crazy ride, with the donkey going downhill quickly without stopping. Our friends, who were with them going down (I chose to take the funicular down), were scared out of their minds.Once you get to Fira, this capital city is filled with narrow, cobble streets between domed churches and whitewashed houses. And of course, shops and shops and shops. While the husbands found their way to a bar to revel in their donkey tails (oops, tales), the wives had fun doing some major shopping,How will we remember the beautiful island of Santorini? Strong Donkey!"
10,“Crowds in Santorini”,"My husband and I just completed a cruise from Athens to Venice, with stops in Santorini, Rhodes, Israel, Egypt, and a few other great ports. We had been in Santorini about 7 years ago, and had a wonderful experience. Here is my take on Santorini now....We arrived in the morning, it was a weekday, we got off the ship mid morning around 10am. I know from being there awhile back that the transportation to the top is either by mule, or by tram. The tram line was one hour long. Walking was not an alternative, and mule was not an option for me,however our friends did walk up, trying to dodge mules, people and poop. When we finally did arrive at the top, the amount of people trying to get down, mixed with the people trying to ge up was an incredible amount of people unable to move in any direction. I went into one of the shops and was told that they have between 4 and 6 cruise ships into their port on most days in the beginning of summer to the end of summer and beginning of fall. Well, thats about 10,000 people arriving at the top at the same time, and going back at the same time. It just doesn't work. By the time we got to the top, by husband was ready to just wait for the tram and go back to the ship, I convinced him to walk a little , go the back roads, and jump a cab and have the cab take us to a small fishing village, where they catch and grill fish in front of you. It was charming, and a relief to be out of the throngs of people. The world has gotten smaller with large cruise ships coming into these very small and charming towns. In my opinion these towns cannot obsorb the amount of people they are getting on almost a daily basis during the tourist season. The large cities can easily absorb large amounts of tourists, but I would not recommend going during these busy times. It really takes the fun, and wonder and excitment out of travel. Make sure if you are on a cruise you get up top early, and leave as late as possible to avoid the prime time crowds. ."
50,“My favorite island of all”,"We visited Santorini via a cruise stop in April. It is the most beautiful island that I have visited. If we were not bringing young kids, we would have riden the donkey to go up to the rim. Blue sky, white wash buildings dotting with blue domes, it's just picture perfect. I wish to go back some day."
50,“Wonderful Greece”,"This island is a must see. It is beautiful, laid back and has much to offer. I wish I could have stayed longer."
50,"“Romantic Santorini, Greece”","For almost ten years, I have been dreaming about visiting the Greek Isles. Well, that dream finally became a reality for me and my boyfriend in September! I have always heard that Santorini, Greece is one of the most beautiful places in the world and after experiencing it, I can tell you it is!If you have the luxury of staying on the island for at least 4-5 days, I highly recommend it. Santorini is unlike any place that I have ever seen with its tall, soaring cliffs that sit majestically upon the deepest, blue water that you have ever seen. The main town of Fira is the center of activity in Santorini. As you ride the cable car up the majestic cliffs, you are greeted by the picturesque, white-washed buildings and the blue-domed roofs that sit upon narrow, cobblestone streets. You definitely want to stay at at hotel that offers a view of the caldera and water. We stayed at The Cosmopolitan Suites boutique hotel and the view was breathtaking! The hotel is in the heart of Fira, but yet is so peaceful and quiet. It boasts an infinity pool that sits on the edge of cliffs that overlooks the blue water and caldera. Although the rooms are smaller, you don't want to waste a minute of the day in your rooms. Instead go out and experience the beauty of Santorini!During the day, make sure you visit Lucky's Souvlakis for some cheap, but amazing gyros. Also, there are a few wineries on the island which makes for a really fun day and last but not least, bring your hiking shoes to experience the true beauty of Santorini. There is a walkway along the coastline of Fira that takes you through the small towns on the island. In Imerovigli, there is a large, green mountain that you can hike down to and visit a church that sits at the edge of the water. This hike was where we got most of our most beautiful pictures!Hands down, the most favorite part of our trip though was spending the afternoon and evening aboard the Thalassa sailboat. It's a large, wooden sail boat that takes a group of about 30 every afternoon to experience the island. First stop- hiking the volcano, then we got to dive off the boat and swim in hot springs which was amazing. While we swam in the warm water, the crew set up a wonderful buffet of traditional Greek food and wine that was really good. While we enjoyed the food and wine, the boat sailed close to Oia which is famous for their sunsets. To top off this amazing sailing excursion- as they sun began to set, a saxophone player began to play. There is a reason why you will meet so many honeymooners and couples that are getting married in Santorini, it is really that beautiful and romantic!"
30,"“amazing place, too commercialized”","with four cruise ships in the harbor, and we visited on the off season, you can venture to guess that Santorini has succumed to some of the more awful aspects of tourism. We went for the day with our kids and found people, both other tourists and business owners, to be less than friendly. Although an amazing geological wonder, it isn't a place I plan to visit again."
50,“We did Santorini with a toddler!”,"Just wanted to let all those aspiring parents know that Santorini CAN be done with a toddler! We just returned from an amazing tour of Greece with our 2 year old and had the time of our lives! All we needed was a solid stroller (Maclaren, for us!) and the willingness to stay on our son's schedule. He slept, ate, and enjoyed himself immensely - especially the playground at Oia! So to all the naysayers who said it couldn't be done - I'm thrilled we didn't listen! Santorini is now one of our most beloved places...and then chance to spend it with our boy made it even better!"
50,“Our first trip to Santorini”,"Our first trip to Santorini proved to be fun, relaxing, and tons of incredible scenic views. We did lose out on some activities as the ancient ruins were still under renovation and closed. However, the views off the cliff cities of Thira (Fira) and Oia are spectacular and breath-taking. The sunset is a must in Oia with your loved one next to you and some snuggling in effect ;) I would highly recommend the cadera boat tour. But, I would spurge and get on a semi-chartered boat (less people, and more time to do what YOU want to do). You get grade A service, and a wonderful, fresh grilled seafood and fresh Feta cheese in your Greek salad. If you plan in advance, you can get a discount off those expensive boat tics."
50,“My favorite place in the Greek islands”,"Beautiful place, so white and clean.Beautiful scenery"
50,“Breathtaking views”,"We enjoyed a port call in Santorini Greece in June 2009. We took the infamous donkey ride up the trail when we first arrived. It was fun and not at all scary. The donkeys seemed to be treated well and given plenty of water. My husband and I are in our forties and are both glad we took the meandering ride. Once we reached the top of the hill we rented a car and went to Oia. Every turn of the cobblestone paths was a picture waiting to be taken. We felt as if we had stepped off a ship into a postcard. We found a little outdoor cafe and had a greek salad, spanikopita and baklava to taste while we took in the scenery and people watched. It was wonderful."
50,“Best place to get engaged!”,"We had an amazing trip!!Beautiful beaches, especially the red beach. Great night life and music, but also many places to eat a romantic dinner together.We got engaged as the sun went down. What an amazing trip!!!"
50,"“Santorini, best place to start your island adventures of Greece”","Santorini is probably the best known Cyclades island of Greece, thanks to movies and TV series all over the world which shot romantic getaway scenes here.Fira is the capital of the island, we stayed in the village of Oia, in late April. It was before the official rush of their tourist season, so we didn't have to share the island with much of a crowd. We could find parking easily on the streets of Fira, and we were mostly alone in the side street souvenir shops. That allowed us to chat up with the shop owners about the merchandise and their customs.We happened to be there over the Easter weekend, so we got to see their Easter parade at Pyros - what a sight! That's the biggest crowd we've seen filling up a little square in the center of town, right at the bottom of their main church where the parade started. Whole lambs were being roasted on spits in the restaurants by the square, in anticipation of Easter Sunday's feast all over Greece! We waited and didn't follow the parade as we wanted to see the town gathering at the square. Then for a bonus, as we didn't read this in the travel book, little boys ran and lit up all the oil cans we saw scattered along the parade route when we had strolled up to the church before sunset, and the whole hillside lit up like a grand birthday cake, everybody ooh'd and aah'd at the sight, wish we had a better camera with tripod to capture the flaming cans shaped like a burning snake up and around the hillside......Naturally, how can one describe Santorini without mentioning the caldera and the blue, blue Aegean Sea. We rented a villa (the hillsides are full of them) facing the caldera in the distance, and almost vertically right on top of the Oia harbor, where we took a ferry boat tour of the caldera the 2nd day we were there.Santorini itself is a remnant of a huge volcanic eruption, so the hillside is very steep, providing for a grand vista of the deep azure Aegean Sea on one side of the island, and some olive and other farms on the leeward side.For the rest of our days in Santorini, we took a drive around to the various beaches, the red, white and black sand ones, picked pumice by the handful on one - most of them are pretty deserted at this time of the year. We found a farm store ""manned"" by the farmers 3 sons and daughters, all younger than 13. They could barely converse in English but were so cute that we purchased a jar of the largest capers we've ever seen, some Greek spices and a bottle of their home brew to try out. They also didn't refuse taking pictures with us! So cute!We arrived in Athens in time to share a fantastic Easter meal with our Greek friend (the town was deserted because of the holiday). Hope their home has been spared by the recent wild fires! God bless, Yrgos and family!"
50,“My favorite place in Greece”,"Santorini is absolutely breathtaking! The Aegean Sea is crystal blue and the white washed buildings atop the mountain look like snow from afar. Santorini is a horseshoe shape due to the volcano which had erupted. You can take a boat to the volcano which is still active today. In the town Kamari there is the black pebble beach and in Akrotiri there is the red sand beach. Fira is a beautiful town with quaint cobblestone walkways. There are many shops and restaurants where you can taste the local fare. The town Oia is a beautiful place to watch the magnificent sunsets. Everywhere you look, the view is gorgeous. I highly recommend going to Santorini. You will not be disappointed!"
50,“Island of the Gods”,"This island is absolutely amazing!!!! I was in awe of everything: the mountans, the beaches and the water (hues of blue, green and even purple like you've never seen!), the architecture and the sites! The food and people are terrific as well! The weather is wonderfful too but it can get very hot! Let me just say that it's like being in a dream or movie! It was so surreal! This has to be, without a doubt, one of the most beautiful places on earth and beyond! And the jewely! Oh my God! it's like nothing you've ever seen! It's incomparable, like the island itself! Really! If you only visit one place ever in life, this should be it! Greece, as a whole, is fantastic and I've been to several of the islands and a couple of cities but Santorini, by far, was my favorite!"
50,“Beautiful Santorini”,"If you are ever to go to Greece, Santorini Island is a must! We went mid-May (2009) for our honeymoon. Tourist season was about to begin and it was not very busy at all. The weather was hot during the days, but amazing by night. It was so romantic and cozy. The people are all very sweet and accomodating (all speak several languages). It is not only the place to go for lovers, it has much history. If you appreciate history, you will appreciate Santorini. We had a fabulous private tour guide that made the island all the more enchanting for us. There are several beaches all around the island: black, red and white beaches! Anywhere you stand on the island will have an amazing view. The shopping isn't that fabulous, but you can definitely find great wine and authentic Greek foods to take home with you. There are 4 major wineries on the island. You must try the Vinsanto wine, amazing! The food is great! Greek salads and souvlaki were my ultimate fave. The fruits and veggies are so fresh! And most of all the food is very affordable. We stayed at the Andromeda Hotel in Imerovigli, the highest point on the island. I definitely recommend the hotel, it was amazing. The customer service, cleanliness and view is to die for. If you like to get out on a boat, we took a fun sunset cruise. Lasted 5 hours, and they gave us wine, dinner, cake, played live music, you could take a swim and hike up a volcanno. Santorini has so much to offer although it isn't even that big, we toured the entire island up down and all across in one full day. The ultimate postcard photo of the white churches with the blue domes located in Santorini don't lie. The views and the island just captivate you for more! Opa!"
50,“My favorite Greek Island”,"I had wanted to see Santorini for years, having read about it and seen countless pictures. I was finally able to realize my dream trip there last year. We went there on an Oceanic cruise. As we were sailing up to the island, it took my breath away. My dream had come true! Once we got to the top of the island, we visited Fira and Oia. I have to say that Oia looked like every travel photo I had ever seen. It took my breath away...all those beautiful white houses with blue roofs...overlooking the beautiful blue caldera. I only wish I could have stayed longer. I hope to return again some day and stay longer than the one day we had. It truly is a dream spot."
50,“Bring me here when I am on my deathbed”,"We arrived from Athens and were immediately bowled over. Yes, it's cliche to comment on the pristine blue-whiteness of it all, on the donkeys lazily climbing hills, nonchalantly running over spry old-lady tourists, on the ravaged and beautiful remains of a once-terrorizing volcano, on the sunset that i wanted to eat....yes, it is cliched, but for a reason. By the way, the single best tomato I ever consumed (and then its' 10 brethren) was here. Apparently, the volcanic soil and the ingenious growing techniques that farmers here have evolved over, literally, millenia (you can say that about a lot of things in Greece) have produced a product better than any San Marzano you'll ever overpay for. Again, I want to die here and I say that with all seriousness."
50,“My favorite place on Santorini”,"Ia is THE best location on the island. Much cleaner, slower, and friendlier than where the boats come in."
50,“The most spectacular Island in the world!”,"My sister and I just returned from the trip of a lifetime! I will spend the rest of my life travelling and probably never top this one. The natural beauty of Santorini, the wonderful people, great Greek food and blissful weather was much more than I ever dreamed existed. From the Caldera sunset views to the sunset dinner cruise to the volcano, there was not one single moment in Santorini that did not create memories that I will cherish for a lifetime! Make sure you take a nice camera with you to capture all the beauty of the turquise & royal blue waters and the reds and orange splashes of color on the cliffs. Fira is the place to be. Don't pay attention to the review s that say it is too crowded, we found that in September the weather is still nice and Fira has just the right amount of locals and tourists to have a blast!"
50,“Open Air experiences: Cinema and Massage”,"We got back from Santorini a couple of weeks ago and I wanted to share a few experiences.Ted's Catamaran was a bit expensive for us (150 euros) so we went on the Akotiri pirate ship for a day trip for a third of the price. We saw the catamaran at the red beach and we seemed to be having much more fun (if slightly less luxury) on our boat.A highlight of the holiday was a visit to the Open Air cinema in Kamari which is so pretty. It is quite out of the way if you are walking but the walk is worth it for such a special venue. See http://www.cinekamari.grI considered having a massage in one of the hotels but they were so expensive. The receptionist at our villa recommended going to Kamari beach and we were very glad we did. There are a few Chinese ladies walking along the beach offering different massages, approx 20 euros for half an hour and our one was excellent, especially following a hike up thevolcano!!"
50,“Best place in the world to get married!”,I recently went to Santorini to get married and had the best time.We booked our wedding through a company called ' Weddings in Santorini' who were brilliant at making it such a special day.The holiday before the wedding was fantastic as Santorini is such a gorgeous island. It has amazing scenery and the sunsets are stunning.This is the perfect place to holiday but even more perfect for a wedding!
40,“Santorini”,"No matter how many people who have visited Santorini tell you how beautiful it is, you cannot be prepared for the breathtaking reality of this island. It is beyond description, with fabulous views everywhere you turn. Just one word of warning - this place is not for those who have difficulty in walking, especially if you go to the Caldera side (the side that's built into the side of the cliff). The sunsets are truly amazing, and people actually clap when the sun disappears, that's how good it is! Great restaurants and fantastic little shops, especially those showing art exhibitions."
20,“Port of Santorini. Be careful!”,"I visited Santorini, at 26 of August 2009. The island is wonderful, and it's a place you must see.. But be careful at the port everything is super expensive.Especially if you need to use the internet, you should never go to the internet cafe Spartakos.The owner is not very polite, the price per hour is extremely expensive and the computers are not working well.. On top of all that, in the same room there are wines, onions, potatoes and other vegetables.In my opinion you should enjoy the island away from the port and its cafes."
30,“Day in Santorini on Cruise”,"Our August '09 cruise on Holland America took us to Santorini for a day and I was scared to scale the steep hill to Fira after reading many reviews. First a few details: large ships must drop anchor and tendor. There are two docs that tenders go to: one that busses wait at for pre-arranged tours and the other below the cliff-top town of Fira that everyone without an arranged tour goes to. There are three ways up/down to/from Fira: take the tram, walk the 580 stairs, or take a donkey. Donkeys and tram are about 4 euros each way. The tram is very steep but quick and only mildly scarey. The stairs are wide and long, but are crowded with donkeys and their droppings, and it is a very long 25-40 minute walk in the heat. The donkeys smell (and you can often tell when you pass someone on the narrow streets in Fira if they rode a donkey). Since we were the only ship there, the tram wasn't crowded but we planned ahead and took an early tender back so as to not miss the last one due to long lines. The streets of Fira were crowded just the same with people and gift shops, most selling the same thing. There were a few beautiful churches nearby and a convent to visit. Restaurant views were magnificent. Extremely hot in August, but narrow streets afforded some shade."
40,“Fun ride on cable car”,Our Costa Victoria cruise ship arrived at Santorini July 2009 and the excursion bus took us up on the winding roads from the tender boat docking area. For the end of our tour we were given tickets for the cable car to take us down to the tender boats for our return to the ship. It's quite an interesting & scenic ride down to the shore from the town of Thira. It's true most Greek island tourist towns are much the same but the volcanic nature of Santorini does make the island a bit unique and you'll enjoy the view decending down.
50,“Beautiful Santorini!”,"Arriving at Santorini via ship is the best way I can imagine! Those cliffs as you approach and the entry route into the island are just beautiful. I felt Santorini was more visually appealing than Rhodes as the coastline is just more spectacular.We started our tour by tendering to the island, getting on a small ship with about 15 others and heading to Nea Kameni, the volcano island. Once there, you face a fairly strenuous 30-40 minute hike up to its highest point, which all in our group achieved (note: on our return, we crossed some older folks from other groups that had quit patially up the path, so be prepared). Nea Kameni is located in the middle of the overall string of small islands that make up the Santorini area. As we approached the peak, we could see small levels of steam venting from a couple of spots inide the volcano. You could rub your shoe just a couple of inches into the ground and feel extra heat, too, which everyone enjoyed -- even if it got most of us wondering just what we were on! We were assured this was typical and safe and didn't think about it again. At the island's peak, again, beautiful views. It's was a very nice part of the excursion.We then sailed to what was referred to as the hot springs, but this was a bit disappointing. There is a small bay on another island very close to Nea Kameni. Yes, where they encourage you to swim you can swim to small pockets of warm water, but it's not like what I think most of us expected as far as hot springs go. Please note: where we anchored for the swim, the skipper claimed we were just thirty meters or so to the shore -- it was more like 100-130 meters. I was fine with it, but one woman get a little panicked as she tired (but she made the full trip!) and another turned around only after a few minutes swim feeling it was too far for her -- she stated she was not a strong swimmer. If you're a confident swimmer, no problem -- a 10 year old made it having a blast (he was a good swimmer and was with his mother).We then headed to the main island of Santorini. The excursion included a visit to a winery, which I just incorrectly labeled. You really visit a wine shop that likely has a vineyard nearby, but it's nothing like a true visit to a winery, such as in Napa! The saving grace was the ""winery's"" location -- high up on the cliffs offering visitors a spactacular view of the island's sea and land makeup! After our initial disappointment of the ""winery"", we kicked back at a table overlooking a beautiful vista and enjoyed a glass of wine and some cheese. It was great!We closed our time on Santorini with a walking tour through Fira, which is what most of our see in brochures and most references to the island. It is a very nice and soothing walk; you should go knowing the the restaurants and hotel offerings on the sea side of the walkway are a good bit more expensive than the same locations 15 feet across the sidewalk. Hey, you pay for a view wherever you go, right?! And the views are terrific!We took the gondola rather than the donkeys down to the docks and tender ship and ended our visit to Santorini. Truly beautiful island with lots of shops, of course, so bring your credit card -- it's an expensive island!Note -- We had a number of people from our ship tell us that they loved their visit to Io (that's an ""i"", not an ""el"") which is the town that sits on the northern tip of the island. I'd like to visit it next time -- they say the uber-rich have their homes there, so it'll definitely be just a visit!"
50,“Favourite holiday destination”,"This place is totally awesome and is definitely a must see. Def one of the most beautiful places in Europe with cool White caldera views, amazing sunsets, great beaches and awesome food. Stay in or near Fira and rent a moto to get you round the island (try alex moto www.rentmotoalex.gr who were really friendly with reliable motos and you can get a good deal if you rent a few days). Best swimming is at the amazing red beach or little known rock beach at the bottom of the cliff from Oia (some good cliff jumping here too). Parissa beach has loads of good bars and restaurants and watersports. We stayed in Fira at the aressana hotel and spa which is perfectly located next to the main church, has awesome breakfast buffet and extremely friendly and helpful staff. You can't go wrong (and wicked cocktails)"
50,“Save money in Santorini”,This island is everything you imagine and more. Wanted to give people a heads up. I f you catch a ferry to the island don't spend the 15-20 euros on a cab to get up the hill take the local bus. It's only 2E and they are beautifully clean and cofortable coaches. not at all what you would expect for the local bus.
50,“Serene Sunsets in Santorini”,"Just a great place to get away from it all.Stayed here 5 days, and 4 were absolutely perfect weather. The one day that was a little iffy was because it was ridiculously windy. This made for an interesting boat cruise to the volcano (Caldera) and the Hot Springs.Things to do on the islandRent an ATV (for as little as 8 Euros a day);Take a Boat Cruise (at least to the volcano and Hot Springs, if you are staying there more than 4 days, splurge and watch a sunset from the boat);Take a Donkey RideIf you stay in Thira, spend a day in OiaIf you stay in Oia, and aren't on a honeymooon, spend a couple of nights (and one afterooon) in ThiraIf you are beach bum, try Red Beach, which is South. I know everyone talks up the black sand beaches, but thought Red Beach was a better beach to take in.I stayed at the Majestic, which was pricey but it was nice to be pampered after being completely jet lagged in Athens.Seafood was very good, and you can find lots of bargain meals in Thira. I actually had sushi at one restaurant, and it was really nicely prepared!"
50,“My fav place in Greece”,"Its one of the most beautiful places in the world.Have never seen something like this before. Its a mix of eerie and gorgeous.Its a beautiful lil island, where people seem to be living on the edge. Its funny how a place like this where almost every 50 years the town is wiped out is special because of its history.a trip to the caldera, the red sand beache and the archaeological sites are a must. Make sure you take up a place not close to the main city center but with a view."
20,“If you like to ride a donkey!”,"If your cruise takes you to Santorini, stay on the ship. Hills, hills and more hills, and to get to the top you ride a tour bus or a donkey.Enjoy the pool aboard ship, use plenty of sunscreen, and you won't be sorry."
50,“Anemelia Restaurant (taverna)”,"Very good food ,traditional greek (seafood)Very good prices, good location.Sea side and large outside area.Open from 12.00 to 23.30.Mr Giannis is from Naoussa in North Greece and will show you the real greek hospitality.[--]"
50,“A couple of notes...”,"For hotel info, see my review on the Santorini Princess.We stayed the last week in April and the weather was beautiful but chilly. Apparently rain showers are not uncommon but we lucked out and had none.The end of April is just prior to the high season and many restaurants are not yet open. Not a problem though as there were still plenty of dining options and the ones that were not open were likely more touristy (more expensive and less authentic).To pack for an April trip, shorts unnecessary but capris work well. Jeans were nice for the evening as it became quite cold and there is a lot of open air dining. The island is pretty casual so nice jeans are just fine. Comfortable shoes are a must as there is a lot of walking to do. Flipflops are fine for brief walks but, for instance, you wouldn't want to walk from the Santorini Princess to Oia in them. A closed shoe is ideal for walking as small stones and grit can be a problem in sandals.Definitely bring a warm cardigan for evenings and even day in April. A windbreaker is also great. Some nights my sweater was enough but there were nights I was glad to have my windbreaker. We did have a few days where it was warm enough to lay out by the pool but, in April, there is no guarantee.Even with cloud cover, the sun is fierce and you'll want to bring lots of high SPF sunscreen. I was vigilant and used more than one kind (all 30+) and still managed to get a little crisp. The April weather was exceedingly pleasant for hiking.Transportation - We found walking to be sufficient in most cases with a one day car rental for hitting the red & black beach, Ancient Fira and a winery. Cabs & the hotel transfer worked perfectly for evening. After walking to Oia, we returned using the bus -- inexpensive and convenient. On an island that small, it is really unnecessary to have a fulltime car rental.The maps we had did not use street names and it led to a bit of adventure but the island is small enough, eventually you figure it out and the signs to various things (including restaurants) are very good.Restaurants -Galini on the black beach is good. Not easy to find but the view is stunning.Iris Restaurant, between Santorini Princess and Rocabella hotels is wonderful. Ask for Yannis, tell him what you like & don't like and how much you'd like to spend and he'll make you a wonderful meal. Share a drink with him afterwards if things aren't busy.Lotze in Oia isn't very good but the view is beautiful.The red beach is amazingly gorgeous. A must do.You can walk or drive up to Ancient Thira. Either way, the trip will be an adventure. We honked when we came to blind corners to help prevent collisions. It's a steep trip up no matter how you go.Wineries - There are a number on the island. Call ahead if you aren't going to a large one. We had hoped to visit one but arrived and no one was there. We ended up at Boutari Wines. They offer a variety of options for tastings, including one with a Powerpoint presentation (14 Euro per person). We opted for the 6Euro tasting without any of the presentations and had to endure the Powerpoint presentation anyway. Not a huge fan of their wines but it was an interesting experience. Wineries on the island grown their grapes in baskets rather than upright like they do in the US. Quite beautiful. If you are particular about your wine, read up on Greek wines. There are some very good ones but it helps to know what you are looking for.I don't know about year round but I found that my allergies were in full bloom in Greece at the end of April. It wasn't something that occurred to me while packing though, and I didn't bring any allergy medicine. If you have grass allergies and are going in April, it's something to think about.The island is extraordinary in its beauty. That alone, makes the hike (even for someone out of shape!) from Imerovigli to Oia spectacular and rewarding.We stayed 5 nights and another 2-3 would easily not be too much. I think if I were to do it again, I'd stay a couple of nights in Oia for something different and the majority at the Santorini Princess or Rocabella."
50,“Beautiful”,"One of the most beautiful and romantic places I have ever visited!You need at least two days there to walk around the marble streets in Oia and see the sunset there (locals recommend Imerovigli), hike the caldera and ride a donkey up the cliff.Go before or after the peak season. Even our friendly hotel host advised us to avoid the crazy summer crowds."
40,“The hottest place I have ever been!”,"This was the last stop on my and my best friend's greek island hopping extravaganza! Santorini turned out to be a beautiful and interesting experience, if a little touristy.We stayed in the hotel Lonja, just outside Perissa. Perissa was an interesting town with its unusual black beaches. Our stay on the island was unbelievably hot as we went in mid august so we made sure we stayed around water, whether it be the sea or our hotel pool.Perissa was very nice with a good beach and lots of shops to visit and tonnes of fridge magnets and the like to buy.Santorini was the largest and the island most geared towards tourists but this gave us the advantage of having lots of day trips and excursions available. The shuttle buses and local travel agents were very helpful organisig transfers etc and we went on the most amazing boat trip which took us to the volcanic island and the thermal springs. We climbed to the top of the volcano (where we showed our inexpereince by wearing flip flops and bringing no water - YOU SHOULD NOT DO THIS!!), saw the crater and steam rising from the ground and jumped off the boat and swam to the springs.This was the island with the most supermarkets, shops, restaurants - we got internet access here to write home and this also gave us the opportunity to arrange to see more of this beautiful island. We stayed on some much smaller and quiet islands but as this was our first island hopping trip and we were kinda 'winging it', it was nice to visit a bigger island where everything was organised for you if you wanted it.Definately the nicest hotel we stayed in during our trip on any of the islands we stayed in."
50,“Breathtaking”,"Santorini goes beyond expectations, it is simply one of the most beautiful places on this earth. That said this enjoyment was based on a stay within the town of Oia and avoiding the main town of Fira.Oia is a stunning picture perfect location to base yourself with breathtaking views and photo opportunities from every aspect. idyllic little streets, perfect for wandering and high quality shopping, restaurants and accommodation. The walks along the coastal route are stunning and add to the enjoyment but the views from the hotel balconies and main route through the town are also something to behold.Fira is a typical tourist spot with an abundance of touristy shops offering cheap island goods. The town appears to be ideal for 20 somethings wanting sun, sand and night life. Not for the traveller seeking relaxation and beauty."
40,“Missed your Ferry.Stuck in Santorini.No problem.”,"I have flown to Santorini about 8 or 9 times over the last eight years or so, and on four occasions, because of flight delays, I missed my connection Ferry to Ios Island.In 2002 I was stuck in Santorini for four days because of a ferry strike, which did cause havoc to thousands of travellers who were stuck on varius islands and missed their flights home.Well,no need to worry, every time I missed my ferry I always ended up having a great time in Santorini.Most times i simply got offers of accomadation while coming through the arrivals lounge, and being surounded by dozens of greek hoteliers. You can haggle a price that suits you and what sort of place you want.Its so easy and there is no need to worry about anything, you even get a free ride to the where your staying, and if your only staying for one or two nights, you will most probably get a free lift to the port to catch your ferry, as the hotelier will be most probably be picking up other tourist anyway.All of the above happened to me last year.My plane was 3 hours late, so i missed my ferry to Ios.I spoke to a lady at the tourist shop at the airport, and she introduced me to a gentleman who was nearby, who had a place near Fira at Karterado. His name wasPetros, and a very polite man, who offered me a room for one night, including a full breakfast for 40 Euros, and a free ride to the port the next day.I got to the Pension Atlas,where i was to stay for the night, and was was a very smart and clean place to stay.See the Photos.Petros and his Swiss wife Trudi made my stay most memerable. Oh, and part of the breakfast was their home grown fruits from their garden.Hope to see Petros and Trudi again,the next time i am stuck in Santorini. James.Manchester England."
50,“The most beautiful island!”,"I can't wait to go back, the Greek islands were awesome and so scenic."
50,“Greece Getaway”,"Five ladies planned a trip to Greece with Gate 1 Travel to celebrate our birthdays! Gate 1 put us in absolutely gorgeous hotels in Santorini and Mykenos where we could relax, eat, swim in beautiful pools and tour from the convenient locations where the hotels were located. We had a knowledgeable and delightful guide who met us at the airport and arranged all our transfers to the three different locations in Greece. The tours on the islands were very informative and well organized. We enjoyed the islands and also the large city of Athens. The half day tour of Athens was excellent and covered all the major sites in this large city. The hotel we stayed in Athens was centrally located - we could walk everywhere: shopping, restaurants, sightseeing! We met and enjoyed other travelers that were on the same tour in Greece with Gate 1 and look forward to using Gate 1 Travel again in the future. Their guidance and planning made our trip to Greece a memorable one! Thank you, Gate 1 Travel."
50,“Majestic”,"I have just returned from Greece and my island trips and have huge 'island withdrawal symptoms!' Santorini was awesome, although i only spent a few days there. It is as majestic as some of the reviews have mentioned before. Coming from Africa, i did not think i could feel quite 'at home' elsewhere, as i did there! As a single woman travelling solo, it was entirely safe all hours of the day and not having to look over my shoulder each time i ventured out of my hotel, was absolute bliss in itself to me! I did the walk from Fira to Firostefani and then further on to Imerovigli...although i was told by some locals that it is about 20km in total, it did not seem as long at all, since the views along the way are absolutely breathtaking and as if time stood still!I must also make a special mention to Vassilis 77 - He'd been most helpful with info via tripadvisor for a few weeks prior to my departure and i actually met up with him on the island - 10 points for hospitality, helpfulness and a good friend on Santorini!!!One last thing.........I'LL MOST DEFINITELY BE BACK!!! ;-)))"
40,“Great Views”,"Perhaps the best views ever but Santorini was not what we expected. We were looking for quiet villages on our island tour and Santorini is relatively small with 2 major towns but while we were there in mid September they had 4-6 cruise ships every day. Far more touristy that we wanted and no ocean to enjoy, it's all on the cliffs overlooking the ocean. Enjoyed our hotel, Filotera. Very accommodating and friendly."
50,“The highlight of my vacation”,"Santorini is absolutely beautiful! our ship anchored and we took a tender boat to the island of Santorini. Once we arrived, we had a choice to take the cable car, walked 600 steps or take a dunkey up the steps to get to the town of Fira. I decided to go on the dunkey with my girlfriend. It was the most fun I've had in a long time and the most amazing experience. I have never seen so many beautiful jewelry aside from Ponte Vecchio, Florence. From Fira we took a bus to Oia (pronounced EE-AH) which is the northernmost village and offered the most pituresque view you can only dream of! From the top you have a phenomenal view of the ""caldera"" volcanic cliffs, beautiful domed churches and the Crystal blue Aegean Sea. For lunch we had the best Greek salad with the tradional olives, tomatoes, cucumbers, green peppers, Feta cheese, olive oil and vinegar. We had a great wine called Vissando which is a sweet wine that looks and tastes like a liqueur. Overall, It was a memorable trip that I will cherish the rest of my existence."
50,“A beautiful island”,"We have just arrived back from two weeks. Although we did not go to Oia, we did hire a car and visit Fira, Imerigovigli, Vlayida and Kamari, and generally travelled around the island. The people were friendly and the driving interesting. We stayed in Perissa and enjoyed our many evening meals along the beachfront in restaurants such as The Best, God's Garden, Limnes, Forum, Meteora (good greek night with dancing and plate smashing) and many others.The Water Park in Perissa was excellent value and the food was lovely - we visited it 3 times!We saw the sunset at the 'Unique View' Megalahori and I have never been so dumbstruck! The musicians played through the sunset and their singing and instruments disappeared with the sun! I could have cried.Would definitely visit again and recommend to my best friends!"
20,“dont go in August!”,dont go in August when the cruise ships dump so many people on the island at once that you cant get around. We were there when 4 ships arrived at the same time. Pandamonium. Shops and restaurants are packed. 45 minute wait for the donkeys. 40 minute wait for the cablecar on the way down..almost missed the ship! You are always stepping into someones photo wherever you turn. 200 people waiting to get on a bus that holds 50 and pushing and shoving that turns scary to get on. was so disappointed that the natural charm of this island is overrun.
50,“The Most Beautiful Destination for a Wedding”,"Jonathan and I had our destination wedding in Santorini, Greece on May 18, 2008 and the experience completely exceeded our expections.We were initially considering coordinating the legal logistics ourselves but when we called City Hall on the island, we knew immediately that there would be a communication barrier. So we started our research for a English speaking wedding coordinator for Santorini.Through some email communications with different wedding coordinators, we decided to use http://www.weddingsinsantorini.com/. We coordinated with Stella over email and the phone with respect to a list of resources needed for our ceremony and reception before our arrival on Santorini. After arriving on the island, Mos and Evangelia sat with us and discussed the timeline of the event in great detail.The coordinators listened to what we had to say and made great recommendations based on their long time experience and expertise. What impressed us the most are the excellent vendors they used for photography, hair, makeup, etc.The wedding ceremony turned out to be beautiful and relatively stress free - a big thanks to the wedding coordinators. Also, we could not have decided on a better destination. Santorini is the most amazing place to have a destination wedding and we would recommend this place to any couple who is considering going some place unique and memorable to celebrate their big day.Nancy & JonathanLos Angeles, CA"
50,“More beautiful than I imagined!”,"Our 1st view of Santorini was even more breathtaking than imagined and that feeling of being awestruck never really went away. Santorini is not an island to 'do' things on, it's an island to just' be', to sit and admire the view, to walk a bit and sit again.It has a very definite Wow factorAccommodation; We were so lucky with our choice of hotel, The Museum Hotel in Oia, as it is right in the heart of Oia [great for nipping back to for a siesta ]and it has a very welcome pool. .Swimming; We took the advice from the forums and walked down to Amoudi below Oia for the clearest swim off the rocks where i snorkelled over a shoal of 1000s of tiny silver fish. Later, we ate at Katina.s fish tavern in Amoudi. Delicious.Walking; There is a very well maintained coastal path from Oia to Fira. It takes about 3 hours so do it early in the morning before it gets too hot. Incredible views! We took a taxi back!We took the volcano boat tour and found it a waste of money. We were like cattle herded up the volcano in our 100's."
30,“Cyclades”,Is an educated tour and good sightseen but if you can't deal the heat or climbing don't waste your money.......... if you decided to go bring extra extra extra water........
50,"“The [-]Rain, I Hated It!”","Santorini, GreeceArrived Santorini after midnight.Checked in to the youth hostel in Pirassa, which was almost half an hour drive from Fira. I thought it was the youth hostel in Fira, because 6 euros a night caught my attention. It was too late to find out I was going to Pirassa instead of Fira.The next two and a half days in Santorini was raining cats and dogs. Just sad! I was very disappointed not seeing the famous Oia sunset, the third regret of my trip.The first morning was dark and cloudy, did not look good. I knew it was going to rain. My plan for the day was spending a morning in Fira and the afternoon in Oia. It started to rain soon after I arrived Fira, big one, then turned to showers, on and off.I walked around wet, did not feel like in the mood for pictures. I hated it. Because of the rain, Santorini did not look appealing like everyone said.If the weather was good, I believed these pictures would make some good posters in my apartment.I walked on, did not even think about going to Oia in the afternoon since the weather was not promising. I was worried about the volcano boat trip featuring the Oia sun set the next day.Started walking Fira from south to north, took some pictures as I moved along, were not that great. I still wanted to take some pictures of the blue dome roof.I kept walking wet, to the north end of Fira where the blue domes were. I walked past all of the blue dome churches I could find on the postcards, except one, could not get one good satisfying picture. I was out of luck, I guessed.I reached the north end of Fira in a mere 3 hours, around 1:00 pm, which meant I had finished my day already.No way!I took a hike off track to the rock on a peninsula. Normally, I would not do anything like this especially when I was wet, but my sense told me to go for it.I walked underneath the rock, then went behind it, and traced the hidden path further down the hill.Eureka!The last blue dome roof church!Although the weather was not nice, and I should have taken more beautiful pictures, I was happy. It made my day!I went back to central Fira and did some shopping. It started pouring again, but everything looked much better than before.The next day I had the volcano boat trip. There were a few showers in the morning, very windy, did not look good at all.The shuttle bus picked me up at the hostel around 10:30 am. Arrived at the port and saw a few dark clouds, I prayed.First stop was the volcano island. It was an active volcano and I could see steam coming up. As we were hiking to the top, it started getting very windy and very cold. I had my wind breaker on but I was shaking. Oh, it started to rain again. I swear I saw snow at one point!We did not even enjoy the hot spring and the small fisherman town on the another island. It rained pretty hard.The clouds masked the sky dark, the wind roared loud. The sea was rough and the boat swung along with it. Everyone stayed inside the cabin, making it felt like a sauna room. We had no choice but agreed to cancel the Oia part. Sunset in Oia, it was not gonna happen! I returned to the hostel much earlier than expected.The last day in Santorini was much better, at least I saw the sun. There were some showers but it stopped around 9:00 am.Took the bus to Oia early, it sure was gorgeous. I was loving it!Returned to Fira at noon, had something to eat, briefly walked around Fira one more time, then headed to the port for Naxos at 3:30 pm.Santorini, I would definitely come back!"
40,"“Santorini - ""A place to get away from it all""”","We recently returned from ""Santorini"". Weather was lovely, 25 to 30 degrees. We stayed in Kamari, close to the Airport and our accommadation was in the ""Ira Apartments"" around a 20/ 25 min walk to the main strip of restaurants, pubs and shops. The apartment was basic enough (bed soft) but the pool was refreshing on a warm day with sun beds provided. Some of the staff in the restuarants along the main strip were friendly but others were annoying when walking passed. Best to walk a bit away from the water front and seek out places to eat away from the main strip. Would recommend a place called ""No Name"", friendly staff and food was good. A trip to the Volcano a must but shop around before deciding on one tour group. Good idea to hire a car as this way you can see all the island. Overall I would recommend ""Santoniri"" as a place where one can relax and get away from it all...."
30,“Beautiful but sad”,"We visited Perissa a week ago. The resort itself isn't bad. If anything it has gone downhill from our last visit 3 years ago. Why?The number of stray dogs & cats and the appalling treatment of them by the locals. As an animal lover it is very sad and i will not be returning to the Greek islands until they get there act together.They also treat horses & donkeys as bad. Tethered in one place in the blazing sun and no water.It's not what you want to see on this island or anywhere else.It's bad enough in the UK so when you visit another country you don't think it will be worse.The island itself is stunningly beautiful.From Kamari to Oia(Ia).Stunning scenery,fantastic breathtaking views. Top tip: hire a car, don't go with your tour operator.We did the whole island in one day and saw the magical sunset at Oia.Fira is beautiful and very busy. But beware - if the cruise ships are in then expect prices to be tripled.There's one price for your package traveller and another for the many international cruise ships that dock in Fira.If you visit the port in Fira please use the cable car and not the poor donkeys. They have to climb more than a 1000 steps up in blazing heat. Not fair and unneccessary.We found it more expensive than 3 years ago but the hotel(Melthemi) was better than the one we stayed in last time(Gardenia).Perissa - The best & cheapest place to eat in Perissa is Gods Garden. Flora & her husband offer the best traditional greek cuisine & home grown Santorini wine at prices to suit your pocket.The best souvlaki & gyros is Grandma's(opposite Melthemi Club).Artemis the owner is a fantastic host.Overall - if you don't like mistreatment of animals then this is not the place to visit."
50,"“The best place in the world, it is a paradise”",I have been there two years on vacation and this year I am going back.I love this island.
40,“Enjoyiing Santorini in April”,"Santorini is a beautiful island. The scenery is fabulous. We went April 12, 2008, and we were concerned about the weather, but it was great.We stayed 3 nights at the Dana Villas, in Firostefani, walking distance to Fira, and the room had a great view, very clean and comfortable, and the management and employees were very accomodating. Be aware that ALL hotels, we spoke to many people at different hotels, have stepts, stepts, and more stepts. Our room was a 6 story walk down, and then up to get to the street. You have to be able to walk stepts a lot. Sooo when you make a reservation be aware to ask for the room highest to the street. BUT, be sure they have room service to bring brefast, because at our hotel you had to walk down a lot more stepts to go to the hotel restaurant. The brefast was wonderful with LOTS of choices.Rent a car and get a map and drive the whole island. The hotel will get a rental car brought to their location, but you can save money if you go to the car rentals on the street (should be about $30 a day) The tour of the Wine Museum KOUTSOYANNOPOULOUS, volcanwines@waterblue.grwww.waterblue.gr has the best display. Be sure to go back into the ticket area after you tour to get free samples..Do not miss Oia, the red beach, and a boat ride to the volcano with Dakoutros Travel, dakoutros-travel@ticketcom.gr. Fantisy Travel booked our whole trip in Greece and were great..Go to Matt Barrett's web site for great information on Greece travel, greektravel11@aol.com.I stayed 3 nights each in Athens and Mykonos before flying to Santorini.Have a Marvelous vacation.Jennie e-mail -- sauviac@cox.net"
50,“Santorini - Sunset paradise”,"We visited Santorini in August, 2006 and we loved it. It was a last minute holiday booked on the Internet and although the Hotel that we stayed in wasn't the most luxurious, it was clean and we could step out of our room and walk straight out to the pool. The weather was glorious and the best trip of the week was the sunset cruise, apart from the stop off to walk up the volcano, which wasn't as impressive as I had thought it would be.We visited the town of Fira which is perched on the edge of a 260 meter cliff and offers a fantastic panorama of the volcano as well as the sunsets. We sat in a cafe/bar in perfect time for an amazing view of the stunning sunset. As we sat there admiring the view, a wedding party walked past with the bride & groom walking ahead to the sound of a violinist playing, it was a wonderful sight.If we return, (whic I hope we do), I think we may look at Hotels in Oia, which is another village that seems to hang from the cliff face, but which seems amazingly picturesque!"
40,“Beautiful but too many tourists ... like me !!”,"We visited Santorini for a day trip and I have to say thoroughly enjoyed it but I think we were lucky. Our trip was in October and we started at 8-30am when we reached the beautiful town on Oia. At that time it was mainly deserted and we had a wonderful walk around the streets, perched on the plateau above the blue of the Aegean Sea. All very picture postcard and idyllic. However by 11am we could literally not move in the narrow streets for fellow tourists from two or three cruise boats. We just fled away after we had extracted ourselves with difficulty and got back to Thira.There we found long queues for the cable car to the shore and even though I have arthritis in the knees and have to walk with a stick, we decided to walk down the donkey tracks. This proved to be an inspired if lucky decision because one was rewarded with wonderful views and yes one did have to avoid the donkeys and their underfoot mess but that was all part of a lovely experience.So what were my overall impressions - glad I had been ...yes, was it beautiful ... yes but was it being ruined by thousands of fellow tourists like me ... yes. I just hope in a few years it has not lost its obvious charm to the continued tourist invasion but that is the quandary faced by many such places that rely on their natural beauty and inherant culture as their fundamental attractions. Will I be rushing back ...no.Top tips .... go early and if you have the time avoid the cable car queues and walk down... it isn't as difficult as it looks even for old codgers like me."
50,“Cruise Arrival Tips”,"Santorini is a fantastic island, marred by a terrible port. The issue is getting from the water, up the cliff, and to the town - hundreds of feet above. The choices are donkey or walking up a long winding trail, or, taking the 36 passenger lift. We took the lift up at something like 4E per person and this was fine. Coming down near cruise departure there was a gigantic line of people waiting to get on. We like walking so decided to take the trail. It's a disaster - donkeys being herded up - running into people and donkeys coming down, donkey crap everywhere, and crowds of people. It's dangerous - we saw a women get knocked off a donkey and appear to break her elbow. It was pretty ugly.If you take a donkey, remember, they pat it on the butt and you're on your way. There isn't someone to guide it along. Some go and stop, some hurry up, it's a mess.I love Santorini and made it down the trail ok. We rented a car and had a great time - the small archeological museum in town is a must - fantastic relics from 1700 bc Akropiti."
30,“Santorini is not a relaxing place.”,"We went to Santorini last week (Aug. 7-14), 2007) with our 8 year old son. We stayed for 7 days and was quite disappointed. There was not much for our son to do. We went to Kamari beach one day which was ok, but found many women walking around topless something we did not want our son to see. There were very few children around. Santorini is a small island and has nothing much to offer except its spectacular sunset views. Aside from that there is nothing else. Fira is noisy, crowded and full of tourists . There is not a corner without a nightclub. People overflow into the narrow roads. Fortuanately we stayed in a place a bit away from the center and so had quiet evenings. I would not recommend Santorini to families or older couples who wish to relax . Santorini is for partying people. It is also terribly expensive...It is very commercialised, with not much a regard to customer service. We definitely would not come back."
30,"“Ships, ships and more ships”",Don't understand why Santorini is number 1 or even in top ten unless it is in the season when cruise ships don't visit - if there is one!We went for the day from a cruise ship and went for a long walk to get waway from the literally thousands off the boats. Many would be off on coach tours so no escape for the other towns either.You would have to be quite remote to avoid the impact.
50,“Santorini - well worth while”,"but there are other hotels that could be excellent, the one we stayed in was ok (mourelakis? i think it was called) . We ate at a restaurant Skala, in the town of OIA, food was great and not too expensive either.. view.. unbetable!! The island is absulutely beautiful, recomed the anyone in the area to pass by Santorini at least for one night."
50,“Enchanting Greece”,Santorini may not be the best Greek Island for beaches but the scenery at Thira is fantastically breathtaking.We spent a week there in July 2005 (extremely hot at this time of year so air con recommended if available).We recommend Kamari as a base and there are plenty of nice restaurants there and a nice relaxing atmosphere.Very easy to get about by car as the island is not very big.Make sure you leave early to see the sunset at Eia as it does get quite busy and difficult to park. Worth seeing though.I was mesmorised by the scenery and will definately be going back again soon.
50,"“Santoni - wonderful apartment, fantastic restaurants, great wanderings”","We stayed at Manos Apartments in Fira, the main town. The studio apartment was wonderful for having our breakfast on the terrace overlooking the Caldera and snacks in the afternoon before going out to dinner.This was our second trip to Santorini. We rented 2 scooters, toured the island again, horseback rode the beach by Perisa.Had a fantastic phenomena having dinner at an outdoor restaurant in Fira when the fog came flowing over the cliffs to the sea, with the town's lights illuminating in a golden glow. The cuisine was good there too.All in all Greece is a magical place composed of history, architecure, warm friendly people, islands surrounded by friendly seas. Our favorite way to tour the Cyclades is by sailing a yacht, then spend a week-10 days in Santorini. We like Mykonos as well."
50,“Santorini Absolutely Fantastic”,Me and my boyfriend went to Santorini last Aug for two weeks and the whole holiday was superb. We stayed in the Bellonias Villas in Kamari which in my opinion is the best accommodation on the beach front. Kamari which is only a 10min bus journey to Fira is the perfect base for your holiday on Santorini. There are many bars and restaurant along the beachfront I would recommend Atmosphere for food and also Hook Bar which plays great music there is also a bar next to Hook Bar which is also very good. The restaurant in the Bellonias Villas also serves excellent food. A visit to Fira isa must whilst you are in Santorini as you walk up the cobbled street from the bus station the view is breathtaking. We did the sunset cruise which is worth doing just to see the sunset. Overall I would definitely recommend going to Santorini and I can't wait until we go back!
50,“Heaven on this small planet called the Earth”,"I have visited 3 times this lovely island which you might have seen as photos in every addvertisement on tourist quides of Greece. First time travelled by a ferry from Myconos. Adriatic Ocean is a very nice and especially Cyclades is a Pearl of it.You cannot image how it is to come from the sea to Santorini!When you are still on a sea you can see all the white buildingson a top and on slopes very sharply sinking down to a shore.You just have to feel it by yourself ie ever possible!Of course there is a possibility to land on it`s airport but I wouldn`t miss these moments to arrive there from the sea!People there are very friendly and treat you as their friends, nottourists. I would recommend you to stay in some small familyhotels, to get to know it`s owners and through it the citicensliving in capital Fira (Thera), Kamari, Perissa or some other villa-ges in the middle of the Island. Bon voyage!"
50,"“A beautiful, fantastic island”","My girlfriend and I went to Santorini for the first time on the 5th October 2006 for 2 weeks. We are so glad we did for what an experience this place really is.We went with Thomsons who had a list of excursions available but we wanted to do our own thing and to be honest all the excursions are available locally from the locals themselves at a much cheaper rate. However, saying that we did go on the island tour on the 2nd day purely to get a feel for the place and find out what was where so we could explore ourselves. Only 29 euros per person so well worth it. Dont do the volcano excursion as you can book this in several places around for half the price.We stayed in Perissa and i think it was a wise move, Kamari seemed more touristy and less friendly, and Fira is very expensive. There is a bus from Perissa into Fira every half hour anyway at only 1.70 euros. The food along the beach front taverns in Perissa was nothing short of fantastic every time. We ate in most of them and not a single complaint. You get a great meal (large portions too) for between 8 - 12 euros, you would pay almost twice this in the restaurants in Fira for less food. Particular taverns i would recommend are the Porto Costello/Perissa Tavern. This is the first place we visited and the owner Sammy was very friendly, even helping me touch up my drink ordering in Greek. We were given free nibbles and fantastic beer served in a frozen glass, aagh heaven!! We ate here about 4 times and each time the food was great and the service impeccable. Definitely stop by here for a drink and dinner you will be glad you did. If they have a Greek night while you are there make sure you go what a great laugh that was, even the waiters started dancing, fantastic. Forum Bar along the way about 100m is also one of the best for food and service. Superb food and after you have eaten you get a free dessert and a glass of Ouzo, as well as a handshake from the very friendly owner, we ate here 3 times it was so good.Our favorite bar there deserves a paragraph of its own. Dorians Pub, on the main road not the beach front. The owner Nikos and his wife have had this place for 24 years and literally built it up from scratch. One of the most beautiful settings i have ever seen for a bar, full of exotic plants and the trees in the garden were planted by them 24 years ago and look amazing. They charge 3 euros for every cocktail they do and his wife mixes the finest cocktails i have ever tasted. Never have i come across friendlier people than Nikos and his wife and we will be keeping in touch with them now we are home. You MUST go for a drink here and meet them and try the cocktails. Leaving here at the end of the evening we had grins from the pure pleasure of being there (and all the cocktails).If you can, go to Santo Wines winery and tour the place. It costs 3 euros only and you get to see the unique way they make the wine on the island. You get a wine tasting session afterwards of the best wines and i certainly bought a few bottles home, well worth a visit.Fira is essential and i am sure you will go there anyway. So much choice of restaurants with amazing views of the caldera its impossible to recommend any here but try a few for yourself. We went to the Fanari and although we had to wait a while for our main course the Souvlaki is great. You can spend a few days in the town easy with the choice of shops and bars. If you like jewellery you will be in heaven as most of the shops are jewellers, from locally made items all the way up to catering for the super-rich, window shopping these places is nice though. The only problem, although not major, is when the cruise ships are in. The town quickly fills up to the brim with American tourists wearing ill fitting baseball caps wandering aimlessly but if you can handle that you wont mind. We went in October so most of the tourists had gone so was a bit quiter without losing the buzz you would expect.All in all Santorini is an unforgettable experience. If i had to summarise Perissa with a few bullet points they would be the following:Beautiful sceneryExtremely friendly localsFantastic foodFantastic beerPlenty to exploreGo to Santorini and stay in Perissa. You will love it."
20,“The unfriendly Santorini”,"Just came back from a holiday trip in Santorini for 7 days. The view on the island is fantastic and the sunset does live up to its reputation. But if you are looking for an enjoyable vacation with service-oriented staff and friendly locals, then santorini is definitely not the place for you. Not only are the greeks on the island rude and unfriendly, they are also dishonest and disgustingly disrespectful.On our arrival at the airport, we had to take a cab into the capital town of FIRA. There weren't any meters in the taxis and the drivers are free to quote any prices they want. Being first timers there, we didn't know that and the supposed cab driver(whose car had no taxi sign on it) took us for a joy ride to the wrong hotel although he said he knew where we wanted to go. Then he overcharged us(we realised this on our last day) although there was another lady heading to a nearby hotel sharing the cab with us.Greek hospitality is non-existent even in the most expensive of restaurants and hotels. Our hotel located in Fiorestefani had a good view of the caldera but the facilities in the room are trash. Not only did the hot water not run properly, the beds were also so dirty that we had bedbugs biting us all night long. The daily change of towels was no better as we discovered stains that were not cleaned off from previous usage. The cutlery in the kitchen looked dirty and unclean so we didnt cook at all.We read from internet reviews that this greek restaurant called NIKOLAUS TAVERNA in FIRA has very nice food so we decided to head there for dinner. To our disappointment, the food was mediocre and the staff rude and arrogant. When we asked for a menu, they gave us an indignant look and directed us to a hand written menu on a small chalk board hanging on the wall and said rather rudely ""Our Menu is there and hasnt changed for 65 years""..... As if we were supposed to know?!? The other customers who came in later were treated no better ie. without respect.If you think that these are only isolated incidences, then you are wrong. Everything in Santorini is overpriced and overvalued. All the locals will take every oppurtunity they have to suck you dry of your money. I paid 8 Euros for a chocolate milkshake that tasted horrible and came in a small cup in this cafe called FRANCO'S BAR, recommended by some silly websites. The only more reasonable restaurants in santorini might be at Kamari Beach. Even then, sly restaurant owners are constantly on the lookout to cheat your money with low quality food at overpriced rates.Having said all these negative things, santorini does have a great view of the sunset and just being there is an experience in itself. It'd be a perfect place if there was better food at reasonable prices and just a minute trace of service from the arrogant locals."
50,“honeymoon heaven”,"We have just finished a 12 night trip to santorini, greece - we stayed outside Fira in Santorini Princess Hotel it is fantastic. The service was excellent and the rooms/appartments were lovely. If you are looking for an idyllic and relaxing break this is the place for you. The Caldera view is gorgeous. We hired a quad bike and visited different parts of the island everyday - the best beaches were at the south of the island - Red Beach, Perissa, Pervilos and Vichyla. We did Jet sking at perissa but you can do at kamaria also. We went on Captin Teds Catamaran in Vichyla which was really worth while. Best fish restaurant on the island for us was Katina in Oia and best quality and value in fira was Niko's restaurant near murphys bar you may have to queue but it's woth the wait you'll get a dinner for two with starters main course and wine for around 30 euro."
50,“breath taking place”,"We stayed at the Hotel Aressana. Very well located and I am so glad we chose that over the El Greco hotel. Hotel Aressana is just a few steps away from the streets of Fira, which also has the best views of Santorini. Very warm staff and we were feeling pretty good after our experience at the Esperia palace hotel in Athens. An evening at Ia, which is a 20-minute bus ride from Fira, is recommended for the beautiful sunsets. We went to Ia but we were 5 minutes late. We just saw the colours of the sun dispersing. Breath-taking. The town is smaller but pretty. I suggest stay in Fira and spend an evening in Ia.Don’t get fooled by a trip to the volcanoes and hot springs. We paid 15 euros per person for a 5 minute boat ride to the Volcanoes, not knowing that on entering the Nea Kameni (the volcano island) you have to pay another 2 euros per person. An absolute con. You walk almost 2 hours in the scorching heat expecting to see sizzling lava from a volcano which erupted as recent as the 1950s but you just see black pieces of rock all around you. The closest you can get to a volcano are the whiffs of sulphur that you get if the wind blows in a certain direction. Then, they take you to the “Hot Springs” which is not even that hot because it mixes with the icy cold sea and its just a yellow pool of water in a very small bay. Very disappointing!Santorini has the most amazing views I have ever seen. I kept trying to capture the views and was a little sad to leave the place because of doubt that I will ever see such a beautiful place again"
50,“Pesissa.”,"In 2005 my wife and myself found this special island. After 30 years of travelling round Greece and the islands. I kicked myself for not listening to Anthony who's dad owns the Blue Sky in Petra. Lesvos. When in 2001 he said ""You think this island is lovely. Go and see Santorini"". I am not going to mention the acommodation. Which was not impressive. There are many better. See the reviews. But what i will say is that. Firstly the people are really nice. There are also many places to eat and drink. The best restaurant being the Volcano"
50,“The eternal Myth”,"Visiting santorini is a unique experience.A visitor wiil find the best hospitality,friendly people ,marvelous sights.Santorini can be only described as a painting ,painted by the the great master, nature.since the first time my girlfriend -my wife now -and I faced the red volcanic rock ,the first sight your eyes focus on ,as we sailed towards the port ,we were astonished.Santorini is the last 14 years one of our favorite destinations.if you are stressed ,tired from everyday life, or in love ,or you want to love again ,walk on the paths of OIA to watch the most beauteful sunset in the world!HIstory runs for thousands of years in the southern village of Acrotiri .The myth lives there .if you like nightlife ,entertainment ,exelent cuisine(the famous mediteranean)and wine ,then the capital of this small Aegean island FIRA is the place for you.Accomodation and facilities cover every need and budget.Reaching Santorini is easy ,fast boats ,planes frequent.it is up to you .Try to visit this island ,at least once, I am sure it will take a place in your hearts!!!thank you Nick and Terry"
40,“Beautiful views”,"Beautiful island and worth the 9 hour boat ride from Athens! (4 hours on the speed boat). Besides lovely views, there are plenty of things to do; from shopping in Oia, looking at ruins, taking some donkey rides, hiking on a volcano, and swimming in volcanic spring waters. Three days here is pduring your tour of Greece is perfect!"
40,“Santorini is the best!!!”,"My husband and I went this year to Santorini for my hols with our 3 children who are 8 and 10. We had a fantastic time. It is one of the best greek islands, no beery english guys and gals falling out of Stavros's taverna and being sick in front of the children!! We went to two beaches, Perrissa and Perivolos. The better of the two was Perivolos. Not as many stones so easier to get into the sea. We stayed in Perissa, but our appt was not the best. Although it was cheap,it was extremely basic, not what I was expecting, was very noisy and my son's room had trap door in it with about an 8ft drop into some deep water!!!Lots of places to eat in Perissa, but the best place was Finikas. The staff there were so friendly and the food was excellent. Oia and Fira were also worth the visit. Fira for the excellent jewellry shops and Oia for the sunset. As well as the food, Santorini wine is also very good. I've had wine from lots of islands, and Santorini was definitely the best. All in all, it was a great holiday, I know some people who were staying at our appointment found it too quiet - not enough penny arcades for them - we found it excellent. It felt safe for the children and although it was in the middle of august we went not crowded at all. Brilliant! Perrisa was good for children, particularly if you are on a budget, but for couples and those with a bit more cash to splash I would recommend Fira or Ia. Fab looking hotels overlooking the caldera with great views. Its also very easy to get around the island the bus service was excellent. They are all air conditioned coaches, very comfortable and reasonably priced. My kids loved it as at home they go everywhere by car. all the buses go back to Fira so you can't really get lost. You have to wait a bit sometimes though as they don't always arrive when they say they will on the timetable!!! But that's ok you're on hols so no need for rushing."
50,“Things not to miss in Santorini”,"I have been in Santorini last may 2005 for 4 days. The hotel I choose was the Phillippion Villas. Very confortable with breakfast. Things not to miss: Visit Nea Kameni volcano; sunsets at Oia (Try the Seagull restaurant), Kastro and Fira (Try Kafeteria Kastro); Diner at Dyonisius Restaurant (Try the excellent sword fish); Nice beaches like Kamari, Perissa (Have a lunch at Charlina Tavern) and Red Beach; Akrotiri ruins and Museum of Prehistoric Thira."
30,“It's hot and windy”,"Windy island, which they don't tell you until you get there. Being volcanic, it is very grey and arid so don't expect to see much in the way of greenery.Trip up the volcano is hard work, around every bend you think you are there, but there are lots of bends.Island is very small, so everywhere is easily accessible.Thoroughly recommend the submarine trip from Athinios - one off experience.Akrotiri a little disappointing as cover is being built and much of the architecture is under wraps and surrounded by scaffolding, a trip back in five years would be well worth while.Iliada apartments at Perivolos are extremely good value - rooms well equipped and clean, as is the pool and surrounding area. Staff are very friendly and willing to help out when necessary.But, I did have a great holiday, only cloud seen was a small whisp in the distance on the last day - temperatures up to 38 in the shade."
50,“Athens and Santorini”,"My daughter, three of her friends, and I spent nine days in Greece in early April. I can honestly say that there was nothing about the country that I didn't like (except maybe the toilet system). We rented a villa in Oia on Santorini and used that as our base. The villa was rented through www.vrbo.com (#22796) and was a terrific deal for anyone traveling in a group--three bedrooms and three bathrooms (at least 1500 square feet) in a spectacular location with unobstructed views of the caldera. Oia is a charming village, far from the tourist mobs of Fira--except when a tourist bus rolls into town. There are several good places to eat (Anemomilos is very traditonal, and Pelekanos has great crepes), many lovely shops, and breath-taking sunsets. We were told by several residents to try the octopus at Katina Tavena, just below Oia, but it has only open air seating and the weather was too chilly for that. Maybe next time...In Fira, we enjoyed the food at Naoussa and Simos. We also ferried to Parikia on Paros where we stayed overnight awaiting a connection to Mykonos. You can see my review of the Hermes Hotel in Parikia elsewhere on this site (13 euros per person). The cab ride to visit Naoussa on Paros is worth the fare. It is a very picturesque fishing village. In Parikia, we ate a couple of meals at the Pomegranate Cafe along the waterfront. It has a good breakfast menu, as well as dessert crepes. The cafe is very tastefully decorated and you can sit outside and watch the harbor activity.We spent only one night on Mykonos, where we stayed at the Pension Matina. The price was right (about 26 euros each per night) and the place was clean, with a nice view and large swimming pool area, but it is quite a trek up the hill from the center of town, and the proprietor was less than gracious. Still, it is a bargain for Mykonos if you don't mind the walk--or paying the cabfare, which is very reasonable.I disagree with people who say Athens its dirty. It is certainly no more so than many large American cities. If you stay in the Plaka, it is easy to walk to most of the major tourist sites. We also stayed in a Hermes Hotel there. The rooms were not large, but were clean and the marble bathrooms were the nicest we had in Greece. We used a private tour guide when we first arrived in the city, so we could get a good overview. She was knowledgeable, attentive and entertaining. She can be reached at vicky@aspisys.com. Wandering the streets of the Plaka was a delightful way to spend an afternoon.All in all, we found the people, food and scenery to be delightful. I plan to return to Santorini next year in September, which locals say is the very best month to be there."
50,“amazing!”,"I went to Santorini 4 years ago, by hazard, as i was on my way to Creete. Before i arrived on the island, i planned to stay only one night and catch a ferry in the morning to recah Creete. But when i actually arrived at Santorini i felt like if i was on paradise, i stayed there one month i didn't go to Creete and i am going back to Santorini this summer!!"
50,“Белоснежный остров!!!”,"Побывать в Греции и не посетить о.Санторини, значит пропустить необычайную красоту мира!!! Белоснежный остров, сине-белые оконные ставни и двери сопровождают каждую постройку. Узкие улочки, насыщенные сувенирными лавками и церквушками. Магазины с шикарными картинами написанными маслом. Остров маленький, поэтому пары дней достаточно, что насытиться его великолепием. Пляжи с черным песком, еще одна особенность данного места.Санторини - остров вулканического происхождения, ""рожденный"" путем извержения вулкана. Сам город расположился на вершине острова, откуда открывается шикарный вид. На самой вершине установлен камень желаний, к которому стоит только прикоснуться и многое воплотиться в реальности. Желаю всем вновь и вновь возвращаться на остров, чтобы загадывать и исполнять желания:))"
50,“Um lugar inesquecivel.”,"Ao conhecer a Ilha, fiquei maravilhado, desde os primeiros contatos até o passeio la no alto foi sensacional. Andar pelas ruas estreitas, conhecer cada cantinho, subir os degraus, tudo encantado, não esqueço jamais que estive num lugar tão fascinante."
40,“Um sonho”,"Gente, aquilo tudo que aparece nos filmes existe de verdade, aquelas casinhas brancas penduradas na beira do morro acima do mar, as vielas estreitas, restaurantes charmosos, lojinhas. Você pode subir, ou descer, de teleférico, escada (são 588 degraus mas bem suaves) ou nos burrinhos (eles são uns amores, bem mansinhos e não tem sinais de maus tratos)."
30,“bella”,"Sono stato a Santorini, in crociera dopo aver visitato Corfù e Mykonos, l'isola è molto carina anche se mi ha lasciato sorpreso il costo di 5 euro per salire alla città alta. Nulla da dire sul mare, moto pulito, ma è una caratteristica che ho riscontrato anche nelle altre due isole visitate, Ottimi menù di pesce nei vari locali."
50,"“Santorini, picturesque little island”","Pulau kota Santorini/Thera, yang terletak di Selatan laut Aegean, Yunani, adalah tempat yang sanggat indah. Pulau yang terbentuk dari kaldera vulkanik, dengan bangunan2 yang dicat putih beratap biru terletak di atas tebing terlihat sangat cantik. Kota pariwisata ini penuh dengan toko2 cenderamata dan resto2. Pulau yang sangat menawan dan wajib dikunjungi!"
40,"“Trop beau, très chaud”","En croisière maritime, avons fait une halte à Fira après Oia : très belle ville avec là aussi de très belles vues. Beaucoup de monde bien sur qui oblige à prévoir une marge pour redescendre avec le téléphérique mais la vue en vaut le détour."
50,“Какая красота !!!”,"Плыть на кораблике достаточно далеко от Крита (наш отель был на Крите) - 3 часа туда и три часа обратно !!! но оно того стоит !!!!!!!! Потрясающей красоты остров !!!! Столько красок - на самом деле, как на открытке !!!!!!! В день экскурсии достаточно долго шёл дождь, но как только выходило солнышко, было просто здорово !!!!!!! Очень советую !!!!"
50,“Ilha Santirini Grecia”,"Uma ilha cheia de encantos no mar Egeu. Famosa pelo pôr-do-sol que tem como moldura as casinhas brancas de telhados azuis. Muitas opções de cafés, restaurante,lojinhas....Uma dica ( pra quem gosta de aventura) é alugar um quadriciclo para explorar toda ilha. Sugiro hospedar em Firá por ser mais central.Santorini é um verdadeiro sonho"
50,“Santorini es una de las ciudades mas originales que he conocido su particular edificacion en la roca la hace unica.”,"Una ciudad naravillosa, particularmente bella,definitivamente hay que conocerla porque es diferente a cualquier otra. Es comparable con Venecia con sus calles de agua que tampoco tiene otro igual."
50,“Несомненно стоит побывать. И даже вернуться.”,"Был в мае. Автопутешествие от Салоник до Афин. Самолет из Афин до Санторини. Пока не прилетел на остров, немного сожалел о затратах. Теперь сожалею о желании понести их повторно))). Остров большой. Разнообразный. Самолет садится где-то метов на 200 наверное выше моря... Мы жили еще выше. на оконечности с видом на ""жерло"" спящего вулкана. Дорога туда живописна и страшна!)) скалы-обрывы. На рейсовом автобусе на втором этаже обеспечивает прилив адреналина. Обратно ехали на такси. Видно меньше оттого не так страшно и кажется, что менее опасно, но таксисты такой народ... Виды очень красивы. И закат и море вокруг, общее ощущение романтики. На морские яхты и океанские лайнеры с эдакой высоты смотришь, как на игрушечные кораблики. Они даже плывут куда-то оставляя пенный след, но не производя никакого шума...Несмотря на обилие гомонящих людей на узких улочках, уже за углом этого гомона не слышно. Удивительная тишина и покой этого места живут отныне в моем сердце."
50,“QUÈ AZUL MARAVILLOSOS DEL MAR EGEO!!!!”,"En mis ùltimas vacaciones por Grecia,viajè a Santorini.Todo epectacular,los aviones de la lìnea Olimpic,estàn a la altura de los de Turquìa,de Alitalia.nada comparado con los pèsimos aviones de aerolìneas argentinas.En santorini,todo me impactò,las construcciones tìpicas en azul y blanco.La gente en las playas maravillosas.Recorrì toda la isla en 4 dìas.El hotel donde me hospedè el Hermes,excelente.Su gerente una señora,que hablaba muy bien castellano,A la hora de la cena,la noche parecìa una pintura.En el hotel encendìan velitas en los àrboles,una maravilla.Las comidas exquisitas.escribo y la felicidad de esos dìas,me impregna mis sentidos.no me pidan fotos,porque las tengo para mi."
50,“Um lugar apaixonante”,"A ilha com muitas atrações, praias exóticas (areia vermelha, areia preta), sitios arqueológicos, vinicolas com degustação de vinhos, cidade envravada na beira do penhasco e um por do sol maravilhoso...As casas quase todas brancas com portas e janelas azuis. Então de tantos lugares assim é só escolher horários par ter fotos maravilhosas. No fim do verão está com pouco verde, então proporciona contrastes maiores do céu azul e mar profundamente azul!!"
50,“Fascinante”,"He estado alli poco tiempo, solo el intervalo de un crucero, sueño con volver. Merece la pena recorrer la isla, de ser posible a pie, imperdibles las vistas !!!Cada callejuela es un misterio a descubrir, los lugareños son sumamente amables.La ciudad es muy tranquila, no he observado ninguna situacion de inseguridad, para personas con capacidades limitadas para desplazarse se deben consultar previamente las zonas posibles para recorrer, ya que hay numerosisimos escalones, desniveles, etc. que son muy bellos pero pueden resultar un obstaculo.No olvidar una buena camara fotografica y calzado comodo."
50,“semplicemente bella”,Santorini è fantastica descriverla in due parole è poco bisogna andarci e vederla. dal porto prendete la funicolare è visitate tutto il centro storico con negozi e ristoranti caratteristici e una veduta mozzafiato e poi scendete con i muli .....la spiaggia fantastica ❤️correte che aspettate......
50,“La mattina è il momento ideale”,"Consiglio di fare una passeggiata partendo da Fira, lungo il cratere e attraversando il paesino, passando da Firostefani fino ad Imerovigli. In realtà si può arrivare fino ad Oia, ma è molta strada. Il tragitto Fira-Firostefani-Imerovigli è paradisiaco.Partite da Fira intorno alle 10:00, attraversate il paesino, seguite la strada principale ad affaccio sul mare e sulla caldera. E' anche il momento ideale per scattare foto panoramiche da mille angolature diverse. Consiglio un cappellino! Poi da Imerovigli potrete tornare indietro con l'autobus."
50,“Magnifica Isola per Relax e Divertimenti !”,"Sono stato a Santorini soltanto un giorno in quanto meta dell'itinerario di una crociera , ma in quelle poche ore ho potuto apprezzare la bellezza dell'isola . Con degli amici dopo lo sbarco dalla nave abbiamo noleggiato dei motorini ed è iniziato un mordi e fuggi dei vari luoghi, dal centro di Fira a Imerovigli , Oia e Kamari . Indimenticabili il bianco dei villaggi con le loro viuzze pieni di negozi ,bar , ristoranti, etc . Per chi arriva nell'isola via mare da non perdere la simpatica salita in paese con gli asini. Bello bello davvero spero di tornarci presto, magari in aereo per un soggiorno più lungo. Un consiglio... prima di consumare nei vari locali meglio guardare il listino prezzi, non fate come me che nel villaggio di Oia in un Bar 2 caffe ( illy ma brutti) mi sono costati la bellezza di 7 €. Isola indimenticabile con splenditi panorama!!!"
40,“bah!!!Ma le spiaggie dove sono????Gli asini.....”,"Bellissima Santorini....e l'intenzione era di fare un bel bagno magari un immersione e la visita delle sue stradine pullulanti di turisti alla caccia di souvenir...niente...,bagno e immersione rinviate poichè le spiaggie sono dall'altra parte dell'isola quindi ---lontane..............da dove la scialuppa mi aveva lasciato e cioè al porto.Non mi sono scoraggiato e ho deciso di visitare la cittadina e di scendere a piedi.La discesa è stata una specie di incubo non per la ripidita' delle scale ma per gli escrementi di poveri asini, che sono costretti da bande di locali a fare su e giu' dal porto alla citta' e che sono dei criminali potenziali e maltrattano i poveri animali con fruste per accelerare la salita e la discesa con i malcapitati turisti ( 5 euri a cranio).Purtroppo non mi sento di boicottare questa ulteriore forma di forca turistica perchè ci rimetterebbero gli animali ma è sconcertante per cui .Bella Santorini, belli i muli , non gli abitanti!"

40,“Juwel fürs Auge”,"Santorin ist beeindruckend. Hoch oben auf der Caldera liegen die weißen Dörfer, in denen sich ein Fotomotiv ans nächste reiht. Vom Hafen aus gelangt man am besten mit der Seilbahn (ca. 4 Eur oneway) in ca. 2-3 Minuten nach oben. Alternativ kann man auch auf Eseln nach oben reiten, oder zu Fuß gehen. Oben angelangt ist u.U. erstmal viel Trubel, je nachdem, ob gerade die Kreuzfahrtschiffe vor Santorin geankert sind. Geht man dann jedoch zu Fuß Richtung Imerovigili, dann wird es bedeutend ruhiger. Der Ausblick von oben aufs Meer und den Hafen ist atemberaubend schön! Lohnt sich."

50,“Einzigartige Insel mit tollen Lichtspielen”,"Santorin ist keine Insel wie jede andere. Wer zum Baden oder Radfahren nach Griechenland fliegt, ist hier falsch am Platz. Die Natur hat die Insel(gruppe) zu etwas ganz besonderem gemacht: Es ist ein ehemaliger Vulkan mit Kraterrand, mittem im Meer. Die Mitte des Vulkans und Teile des Kraters sind mittlerweile im Meer versunken - der restliche Kraterrand von urgriechischer Bebauung charakterisiert und hinter dem Kraterrand faellt die Insel weniger steil zum Meer ab. Geheimtip: der Hoehenwanderweg von Fira nach Oia (der schoenste Ort der Insel), mit Zeit fuer Hafen und Sonnenuntergang in Oia einplanen. Zurueck am besten den billigen Bus nehmen!"
30,“Santorin - Das Disneyland für Griechenland-Fans !”,"Santorin - Tourismus pur ! Hotelburgen (aber in schönem Ambiente und nicht zu hoch !),Touristenmassen direkt an den Strassen/Gassen der Caldera und das auch in der Vorsaison, da auch täglich Kreuzfahrtschiffe halten.Preise bei den Restaurants an der Caldera die den Ausblick mit in der Rechnung haben. Leider meist auch mit nicht so guter Qualität. Aber der Ausblick ist traumhaft und das muss man leider gesehen haben auf Santorin !!!Die Strände sind in der Regel touristisch voll erschlossen. Ausnahme bietet hier nur der Red Beach. Hier werden vor Ort nur Liegestühle und Sonnenschirme verliehen. Zur Taverne muss man über die Felsen zurück klettern.Allerdings wird dieser auch von Ausflugsschiffen angefahren so das es sogar in der Vorsaison recht lebhaft zugeht !In Perissa gibt es zwar eine schönen Strand. Allerdings gibt es hier auch den Sound der Tavernen am Strand direkt dazu die sich anneinander Reihen - Ruhe nur bedingt. Generell ist Perissa eher auf ein junges Publikum mit mehr Party ausgerichtet. Aber wesentlich niveauvoller wie z.B. Goldstrand in Bulgarien.Oia (gesprochen Ia !) Ist der Treffpunkt für das große Sundowner-Event. Zum Sonnenuntergang geht es dort zu wie in Woodstock.Die Restaurants verlangen entsprechende Preise für Essen und Getränke !Wenn man einen guten Platz und/oder auch im Restaurant bekommen möchte sollte zeitig dort sein. Auch die Busse von Thira/Fira sind zum Sonnenuntergang richtig VOLL (Tix 1,60 Euro pro Person aktuell) !Aber auch das hat einen gewissen Charme, selbst in der Menschenmenge :-)Zusammengefaßt sei gesagt - man sollte es mal gesehen haben - aber ein zweites Mal würde ich nicht mehr Santorin für länger besuchen."
50,“Eine kleine Insel mit grosser Geschichte”,"Santorin ist eine klene aber sehr schöne griechische Insel, die nur 17 km lang un 1 bis 5 km breit ist. Man kann sie deshalb zu Fuss innerhalb von einigen Tagen gut ""erforschen"" aber geniessen kann man sie viel länger. Es ist bewunderswürdig, dass so eine kleine Insel eine solche Vielfahlt an Naturschönheiten hat: grüne Hüllen, steile Felsen, roter Strandsand, ein schlaffender Vulkan und thermale Bäder.Santorin ist besonders durch seine Caldera bekannt, die prakrish ein mit Wasser gefüllter Krater ist, in dessen Mitte sich zwei kleine Inseln befinden: Palea Kameni und Nea Kameni. Nea Kameni ist immer noch ein lebender Vulkan, der ständich überwacht wird und nur mit eine Gruppe zu besichtigen ist. Da kann man wirklich die Hitze in Herzen der Erde spüren. Danach kann man eine durch den Vulkan erwärmten natürlichen Schwimmbad besuchen, dessen Wasser an Eisen reich ist und eine Spa-Wirkung hat.Dann kann man sich einfach tagelang auf der Liege mir einem Kaldera-Blick entspannen und die schöne Sonnenuntergänge bewundern."
40,“Che divertenti i somarelli di Santorini!”,"Visitare Santorini è un'esperienza unica se per raggiungere il paese dall'approdo si utilizzano i somarelli che sono proprio il simbolo dell'isola!All'andata ho utilizzato la funivia per godere del panorama mozzafiato che offre l'isola.Il paese è caratteristico e molto bello con i suoi alberghi, le sue case bianco accecante e azzurro mare, i negozietti uno accanto all'altro...Una favola!Tanta gente, sole, mare...Per ritornare al porto sono scesa usando le scale e ...sorpresa!Somarelli addestratissimi fanno le scale portando e riportando i turisti su e giù.Quando salgono da soli sanno già che si devono posteggiare a spina di pesce:incredibile! Il cattivo odore che si respira passa in secondo piano perchè sei distratto a vedere lo spettacolo dei turisti che non sanno andare a dorso di somaro e quindi urlano,ridono, gridano,hanno paura di cadere...Chissà quante lingue conoscono i somarelli di Santorini!"

50,“El atardecer mas lindo del mundo!”,"Sugiero la visita a esta isla maravillosa. Desde el acceso a su capital Fira subiendo a lomo de burro(es mas emocionante que el funicular) todo lo que siguio fue sorprendente. Las vistas de los acantilados, sus construcciones en azul y blanco, los colores de las flores y sobre todo la hospitalidad de su gente hacen de este lugar un paraiso.

50,“Santorini isola di bellezza e tripudio di sapori”,"Santorini isola di bellezza e tripudio di saporiSono tornata a Santorini 25 anni dopo la prima visita e l’ho ritrovata con lo stesso fascino, nonostante l’assedio quotidiano di turisti di ogni parte del mondo che si trascinano per i negozietti di rabadan di Thira e Oia.Volo con Egean, Milano – Santorini con scalo ad Atene (con orari umani e ottima compagnia).Per dormire ho scelto un B e B con grande terrazzo, a Imerovigli, vista sulla Caldera ed un piccolo angolo cottura che ci ha permesso, alcune sere, di cenare sul terrazzo o, al tramonto prendere l’aperitivo nella Jacuzzi a due posti con un calice di bianco di Thira.Il tutto ad un prezzo accettabile (125 euro) per una località universalmente cara.Le case, in continuo restauro si adattano all’ambiente, anzi sono affascinanti con le varie soluzioni di pregio e qualità. Molta attenzione all’ambiente e, rispetto ad anni fa anche agli animali (ho visto un rifugio per gatti sul sentiero per Thira ).Da non perdere i paesi dell’interno Megaloxori, Pyrgos soprattutto dove ho provato la taverna di Penelopi: una signora rotondetta che prepara i tavoli, cucina e ci fa vedere cosa c’e’ dentro le sue pentole (in una cucina con le meravigliose verdure mediterranee, finocchio selvatico, basilico, foglie di vite e gli immancabili meloni gialletti).Sempre a Pyrgos sono attirata dalla bottega di Evangelia dove trovo piccoli quadri fatti da lei con materiali originari dell’isola da portare agli amici; scopro che è un’artista di origini tedesche poliedrica e simpatica. Parliamo di cucina e ci consiglia il ristorante di un suo amico sulla strada del faro di Akrotiri.Peccato che gli scavi siano chiusi da molto tempo, ma dopo essere stati alla Red Beach e ammirato il tramonto dal faro ci fermiamo alla Taverna Eolon: la cena è un tripudio di antipasti, fava, zaziki, melanzanosalata, pesce e un favoloso Assyrtico di Thira.Interessante anche:la Taverna Dimitri per la cucina, per il posto in cui si trova ma anche per la simpatia del proprietario, al porto di Vlichada un po’ fuori dai circuiti turistici.Santorini è anche isola di chiese, l’interno ne è pieno, alcune molto belle e ...Introvabili non ben segnalate, in particolare la Chiesa di Panagia Episkopi costruita durante l’impero di Bisanzio, nelle vicinanze di Mesa Gonia, dove una sdentata centenaria vestita di nero vi obbligherà ad inginocchiarvi.I sei giorni passano in fretta, tra la consueta visita al vulcano e le spiagge; Santorini è per me magica e nessuna descrizione puo’ paragonarsi all’esperienza di ammirarne i colori, respirarne l’aria e gli odori."
50,“Magnifica”,Isola fuori dal comune. Verrete ammaliati dal tramonto...mai vista una cosa del genere. Gli scorci dell'isola da ogni angolo la rendono una bellezza unica.Motlo caratteristici i due paesi principali. Si possono effettuare anche delle escurzioni in barca verso le isole vicine. Meravigliosa
50,“*Die romantischste Insel der Welt*”,"Nach zahlreichen Besuchen auf dieser Insel, möchte ich auch anderen ans Herz legen, diese zu besuchen!Santorin ist eine recht kleine Insel, die man an 1-2 Tagen ohne Probleme befahren kann.Ganz besonders schön ist die Seite zum Vulkan, man sollte wenn möglich unbedingt hier ein Hotel buchen! Die Insel lebt mit dem Blick! Und vor allem mit dem Sonnenuntergang!Schöne Orte zu besuchen: Fira, Oia, Firostefani.Süßer ursprünglicher Ort: Imerovigli.Schöner Strand (man bedenke, hier handelt es sich um Vulkanstrände, das heißt man darf keinen schönen weißen Sandstrand erwarten): PerivolosSchöner Ausflug: Am Museum Akrotiri (bis 2013 geschlossen) ein Boot besteigen, und damit zum roten, weißen und schwarzen Strand fahren. Man kann am Strand seiner Wahl aussteigen. (ca. 15 Euro pro Person)Viel Spass!"
30,"“Spectaculaire, mais hors de prix”","e ne connaissais pas la Grèce: maintenant, je sais que je n'y retournerai pas avant longtemps.C'est vrai que l'endroit est spectaculaire.MAIS:Trois choses m'ont marqué:*le prix du poisson du jour dans des gargotes ridicules: 90 euros le kg. Ca vous fait une petite dorade au barbecue à 45€. Pour info, la même dorade grise est à 5€/kg à Carouf.* C'est la première fois de ma vie que je vois marqué sur un menu de restaurant: consommation obligatoire de 45€/personne.

Faudrait pas les prendre pour des pigeons non plus.Y rester un we maxi, si vous ne voulez pas vider votre autorisation de CB!"
50,“TAVOLOZZA DI COLORI”,"Isola sicuramente molto nota, forse meno noto e' il senso di liberta', pace e armonia che porta con se regalandolo a chi vi soggiorna....Mi hanno colpito le casette bianche e azzurre che al tramonto sembrano quasi cambiare colore, la cordialita' dei suoi abitanti, la sensazione di essere in un "" non luogo"", come trasportati fuori dal tempo....Affascinante la vista sulla caldera...Isola molto romantica, ma raccomandata anche a famiglie e compagnie di amici.Imperdibile la salita a Pyrgi in moto e la vista che si gode dall'alto su tutta l'isola.Consiglio: non visitatela in agosto! la trovereste veramente affollata!Bella la spiaggia nera di Kamari, diversa dalle quelle consuete."
30,“期待度が高かった分、残念”,口コミやガイドブックで評価が高かったので行ってみました。海が綺麗、ただホテルでのんびりするだけで気分が良い、料理が美味しい、等、すばらしい景色や生活を期待しすぎてしまいました。サントリーニは断崖に町ができているので、海を高い位置から見下ろすだけで、特に海を身近に実感できません。基本的に断崖なので、歩いて楽しいわけでもなく、本当にすることがなかったです。ホテルで一日中のんびり過ごしたい人にはいいかもしれませんが、町に出て食事をしたり海水浴をしたりして遊びたい人にはちょっと向かないかなと思います。そういう人には個人的にはミコノス島をオススメします。
50,“夕陽・・・”,新しい情報でなくごめんなさい、でもやっぱりこの島は夕陽がすばらしかった！私たちは時間もなかったのでoiaからではなく、逆に島の一番南の先端から見ました。マジカル！の一言。一生に一度は訪れてほしい島です。ただ物価（レストラン・カフェなど・・）かなり高めかな。旅行時はユーロ＝112円くらいだったのでまだ良かったですが、150円くらいだと本当に何も買えないくらい高いです。ご注意あれ。
50,“忘れられない景色”,日本人はあまり多くはいませんが、とにかく絶景！島の真ん中は古代の噴火で海に沈み、三日月型の絶壁の島となった。よく”エーゲ海”として、青い屋根に白い色の建物が移ってる写真は　ここ、サントリーニです。アトランティスの伝説とあいまって、この景色は幻想的です。最近では、ウエディングでも人気らしい。
50,“schönster Ort Griechenlands”,"Im Rahmen einer Kreuzfahrt stoppten wir auch in Santorin. Es ist ein zauberhafter Ort. Leider war Nebel, als wir ankamen und bis zur Abfahrt bewölkt - bei Sonnenschein wäre es sicher noch ein wenig schöner gewesen. Ideal für die perfekten griechischen Urlaubsfotos: so stellt man sich Griechenland vor. Malerische weiße Häuser mit blauen Dächern, nette kleine Restaurants mit Blick hinab auf das Wasser. Auf jeden Fall eine Reise wert!"
50,“Ein griechischer Traum in Weiß”,"Santorin ist ein absolutes Muss für alle Insel-Liebhaber und Vulkan-Abenteurer. Allein der Blick von einem Schiff auf die verschiedenen Teilinseln lohnt den Besuch. Highlight ist die Insel-Hauptstadt Thira hoch auf dem Rand des Vulkankraters.Der Besucher ist geblendet von dem Weiß der Häuser und Kirchen. Wir haben sehr lange in den Cafes gesessen, die an den steilen Felsen kleben. Die Aussicht dort auf die Schiffe tief unten ist atemberaubend. Wir kommen wieder!"
50,“海と空と白い壁”,ギリシャに行ったら絶対行ってほしい場所です。私は夜の１２時に出発して朝の７時に着く船で行きました。空と静かな海と建物の白い壁がとても美しくてずうっとここにいたいなあと思いました。イアの街に宿泊しましたが夕日がとってもきれいで最高でした。フィラの街よりリーズナブルで、静かでとてもよかったです。おすすめです。
50,“oia，无语伦比的美丽”,比起熙熙攘攘的Fira，Oia更多几分宁静和精致。在临海的咖啡馆idle的坐一下午，静静看着火山景和深蓝的爱琴海，吹着海风，品尝一下希腊咖啡和蜂蜜酸奶。6点多，跟随着人群涌向了蓝顶教堂和风车附近，所有人都如此专注的望着海面，站在我左边的英国人笑着对我说，“大家的样子好像在等待着上帝的出现！”太阳缓缓降落，偶尔躲进几片浮云里，最终消失在海面的一瞬间，令人痴迷。夜晚的oia星星点点的灯光烛光，更添几分宁静和浪漫。人们都说希腊人不爱工作，其实对于都市人来说，不妨放满送忙脚步，细细的品尝曾经错过的美好。毕竟悠闲也是生活的一部分。

50,"“Santorini, la isla encantada”","Santorini es una de las islas Cícladas mas alejada de la Grecia continental, preciosa desde todo punto de vista, sus playas tranquilas, únicas por su arena volcánica, contrastan sus colores, arena negra, roja y blanca con el azul intenso del mar Egeo, la ciudad eregida en la cima escalonada, sus casas pintadas de un blanco brillante, sus negocios, muchas joyerías de lujo, restaurantes y bares, situados en sus pequeñas callecitas, exhiben mucho glamour sin perder la magia de un pueblo de gente increíblemente amable, y hospitalaria. Sin duda la mejor isla que volvería una y mil veces."
40,“La perle des cyclades”,"L'endroit est magnifique et magique. Déjà Mykonos c'était super, Mais Santorin avec son vilage de Fira, (niché en haut de cette île volcanique) ,ses bateaux dans le port, son volcan, ses tavernes face à mer, ses ruelles, ses petites maisons accrochées aux flancs des collines, son coucher de soleil, son système de cabines (comme ceux à la montagne pour rejoindrer la ville au port), moins fatigant que les ânes (avec la chaleur). ... Un vrai paradis et une évasion conseillée. Mon seul regret : je n'ai pu rester que 2 jours, un peu trop court pour cette excursion magnifique !.."
50,“永恒的日落光辉”,"从克里特岛乘坐了5个小时的蓝星号游船，终于在午后时分到达了希腊最令人向往的岛屿---- 圣托里尼岛。就算没有来过这个岛屿的人，估计也曾经看过关于它的许多美丽的明信片。面对着蔚蓝的爱琴海，耸立着一座白色墙身和蓝色屋顶的教堂，顶上的十字架和波光粼粼的海水交相辉映，和海鸟，游轮以及曲径的小路形成一幅祥和的画面。圣托里尼（Santorini）主要有费拉（Fira）和伊亚(Oia)两个较大的村落，两个岛都可以欣赏到迷人的海景。才刚下船，就看到民宿派来接我的人。一问才知道原来他就是老板，高高的个子，微卷的棕发，深邃的五官，很典型的希腊人。在去民宿的路途中，老板很热情的为我介绍了住宿的环境和岛上著名的旅游景点。而我则倚着车窗，一边欣赏着那深邃的蓝天大海，一边任由岛上午后的海风吹拂着头发。放下沉重的背包，我已经迫不及待的踏上寻宝之路。费拉是岛上最大最繁华的小镇，也是连接各个小镇之间的交通枢纽。步行了10分钟，可以听到越来越喧闹的人声，这里是小镇的商业中心。一间间风格各异的酒吧，装修别致的餐厅，摆满了纪念品的商店，讨价还价的游客和商贩，以及被成群游客包围的肃静的教堂，都让你感觉到人们的热情。对于本来就生活在商业城市中的人来说，这些已不能吸引我的目光，我的心早已在踏上这片火山岛之前就飞向了那个宁静之处。不再让目光流连在琳琅满目的商店里，我脚步急促的穿过曲径的山路，当登上最高之处，我的耳朵已经听不见周围的吵闹声，因为我已置身于那宽广无垠的爱琴海的怀抱里。当一间灰白相间的酒吧突然出现在我的视野中时，心里顿时咚的响了一声，那不就是在旅游书里经常出现的酒吧吗？酒吧的门口很小，门上的木板上写着FRANCO BAR, 被刷成灰白相间的石梯吸引着游客的目光，沿着楼梯往下走，看到的是由灰白蓝色组成的小院，被一束束粉红色的小花装饰成典型的热带风情。院子里摆放着铺着蓝色桌布的桌子和灰色的藤椅，你还可以选择在一个类似洞穴的蓝色‘包厢’里休息。当视线触及到那一排面向大海而放置的躺椅时，我已经按捺不住的将自己仰躺在椅子上，戴上墨镜，点上一杯冰薄荷茶，在布蓬遮挡着的阴凉之处，接受丝丝海风的亲切拥吻走下小镇，抬头仰望着悬崖边上那被当地人形容为水仙花般美丽的白色屋群时，不禁想起电视上一则广告，一名优雅的女子坐在圣托里尼岛上纯白色的屋顶上，被蓝色的天空和海洋包围着情景。在费拉度过了休闲的一天后，我坐上了公车，去往岛上最著名的小镇----伊亚。大约半个小时的山路，就到了岛上海拔最高的小镇。下车后看到的依然是熙熙攘攘的人群，原以为伊亚给我的感觉会延续在费拉时的感受，因此刚开始时并没有太多的热情。当转过教堂旁的一个大弯后，扑面而来的仍然是那温暖的爱琴海的海风。 沿着左手边的小道走下去，可以明显的感觉到人声越来越小，旅客的身影也越来越少了，纪念品商店的门前也看不到讨价还价的情景。不禁有点纳闷，在车站看到的游客都藏到哪里去了？可是比起费拉的热闹，我更爱的是像伊亚这样的宁静。弯曲狭窄的小路，稀疏的游客，坐在商店门前休憩的店主，直接趴在路中间睡着午觉的大狗，炙热的太阳，潮湿的海风，还有那不远处偶尔被敲响的教堂钟声，构成了一幅祥和安静的淡彩水墨画。而作画的人就在我们的心里。或许，这才是我心中一直向往的圣托里尼岛的景象吧。沿着小路原路走回，我再次看到了那幅在脑海中已经根深蒂固的画面。我站在路中间，俯视着，那白得刺眼的墙身，那比蔚蓝的爱琴海更甚的蓝，那竖立着的神圣的十字架，还有那慵懒的趴在墙边眯眼的猫儿，我再也发不出任何声音。心中早已设想了好几种看见此景时呐喊的方案，可是此时却像一个呆子一样盯着眼前的一切，再多的言语也无法形容那激动的感觉。终于体会到，语言在一个人真正激动的时候是会失灵的。一个人站在教堂边发呆了很久，还是忍不住随着人潮的涌动而移步。原来太阳已经快要下山了，难怪大家的脚步越来越快了。这些脚步的目的地都是一致的，就是到那悬崖边上一起静待着世上最美丽的日落的来临。我不想扎堆在一群人中凑热闹，只想找个地方一个人静静的欣赏夕阳西下的美景。一直向着西边的小路走去，已经几乎看不见有游客的踪影，除了几个零散的人坐在露天的酒吧里等待着。穿过酒吧和民舍，抚摸了造型独特的风车，我找到了一块无人驻足的空地，席地坐在围着栏杆的边上，托着腮，一边打着盹，一边等着那火红的太阳的出现。突然一阵惊呼，我猛地睁开眼，那本来还闪着刺眼光芒的圆球不知何时已披上了落日的霞晖，红的如此地灿烂，如此地耀眼，仿佛要将这世上的一切都燃烧殆尽似的。她的步伐是缓慢的，慵懒的，却又是高贵的，高贵的像那将福音撒向凡人的圣母玛利亚。当她浑圆的弧边触及海平面的那一刻，就是大自然最完美的结合。不知是那无垠的大海吞没了夕阳，还是那落日主动投身于海的怀抱，一切都如此的契合。不禁想起巴金先生的那篇《海上日出》，一个日出，一个日落，但是却处于同样壮观的大海背景中，不知道作者当时的感受是否跟我现在的一样难以言喻。随着那最后一弧红边消失在深蓝的色彩里，即使远离那拥挤人群的观日台的我，仍然听到了众人那一声声惋惜的叹息。我还不想就此离开，我要将这一刻永恒的凝固在我的记忆里，我心中的那颗高贵的红宝石仍然在燃烧着，为伊亚这幅水墨画再添加了一抹耀眼的色彩和光芒。让我就此沉沦吧，圣托里尼。"
40,“Villa Clio Perissa”,"Sono stata in vacanza 15 giorni a Santorini ospite dell'Hotel Villa Clio a Perissa e mi sono trovata benissimo.L'hotel è pulito, vicinissimo alla spiaggia e molto tranquillo.Elena, la proprietatria, è gentilissima.Lo consiglio a tutti coloro che amano la tranquillità e un clima familiare.Vera"
50,“Mi lugar preferido en Grecia”,Este lugar es fantastico! De sacarte el aliento!! Nos alojamos en una de esas casitas blancas con vista a la caldera y alquilamos un auto (recomendable) para recorrer la isla. Playas con arena negra y roja! una joda impresionante! gente muy linda de todas partes del mundo! Definitivamente volvere!
50,“イア”,サントリーニ島のイアは夕日の美しさで有名な街。フィラとは違い、街はほぼ完全に白い建物で埋め尽くされています。夏の日中は観光客の多い賑やかな場所でした。ふと街のはずれに足を踏み入れた時、目の前に広がる海に美しい夕日が視界に飛び込み感動したのを覚えています。少しずつ日が暮れ、ホステルの屋根に寝そべって海と空の両方をじっと眺めていました。夕暮れ時、この空は７色になります。土産物等の物価は時にフィラの倍ほどします。２泊ほどされるとゆっくり出来ると思います。
50,“Santorin ist Erholung pur”,"Kommen Sie nach Santorin und erleben Sie die autofreie Innenstadt in vollen Zügen. Sie finden fast alle Hotels an der Steilküste liegend in voller und absoluter Ruhe ... Sie blicken hinaus auf das Meer und hören sonst absolut gar nichts ... nur Ruhe, Ruhe, Ruhe. Dieses Gefühl einmal zu erleben und zu genießen ist unbeschreiblich. Wandern, laufen Sie gemütlich durch die Gassen und lassen die griechische Sonne auf ihr Haupt strahlen. Genießen Sie ein gemütliches Essen in einem der vielen Lokale und lassen Sie ihren Körper dadurch völlig genussintensiv frohlocken. Santorin für 1 Woche ist der absolute Traum für alle, die absolute Ruhe suchen und abschalten wollen von Hektik, Lärm und Stress. Wenn Sie diese Insel 1 Woche lang genossen haben, dann sind Sie sehr lange mit innerer Ruhe erfüllt, die niemand mehr nehmen kann. Absolut *TOPP*."
50,“Perlen der Ägäis - die Insel Santorin”,"Santorin ist ein Reiseziel, dass man zwar oft in der Werbung für Griechenland sieht, aber trotzdem gibt es dort viel zu entdecken. Trotz des Massentourismus gibt es immer noch Plätze, an denen man alleine ist und, die nicht in jedem Reiseführer zu finden sind.Die einmalige, vulkanisch geprägte Landschaft mit ihrem großen Kraterkessel, der Kaldera von Santorin, zählt weltweit zu den interessantesten Zielen des Vulkanismus. Die landschaftliche Schönheit der Insel darf aber nicht darüber hinwegtäuschen, dass wir eine relativ ruhige Epoche der Geologie unseres Planeten genießen. Nicht immer war Santorin dieser Kessel mit seinem tiefblauen, ruhigen Meer.Um diese Geschichte und ihre Dramatik zu verstehen, muss man sich intensiv mit den verschiedenen Schichten beschäftigen, die durch viele Vulkanausbrüche die heutige Kaldera geschaffen haben. Spezialisten, wie professionelle Vulkanologen, können in den Lavafelsen der Insel erahnen, wie es in der Vergangenheit auf Santorin zu ging. Um alle Details zu verstehen, kann man jahrelang studieren und wissenschaftliche Bücher wälzen oder sich einer Wanderstudienreise anschließen, die von einem Kenner des Santorin-Vulkans geführt wird. Dr. Tom Pfeiffer, der über den Vulkanismus der Insel seine Doktorarbeit geschrieben hat und sein Partner Tobias Schorr führen Gäste regelmäßig zu den interessanten Stellen der Insel. Beide verbindet das Interesse an der Geologie und an Griechenland.Im Juni 2008 führte Tobias Schorr eine kleine Gruppe von interessierten Gästen und erlebte mit ihnen einige tolle Wanderungen.Tag 1Schon der erste Abend ist für Ingo und Tagmar eine große Überraschung, denn eigentlich hatten sie damit gerechnet, dass Tobias eine ganz kleine Gruppe mit ihnen alleine führen würde. Alles passt recht gut und zur Überraschung kommen noch Udo und Traude, zwei gute Freunde von Ingo und Tagmar am Flughafen Athen beim Umsteigen dazu. Ein guter Grund, in der Höhlentaverne von Nikos bei Margarita leckere santoriner Spezialitäten zu genießen. Ein guter Start einer unvergesslichen Reise! Das schöne Hotel, direkt am Meer, lässt jeden Zweifel verstummen und die Vorfreude auf die erste Tour ist groß.Tag 2Nach dem Frühstück am nächsten Tag geht es an der Küste von Akrotiri zum „roten Strand“. Dies ist ein im Sommer oft überfüllter Strand, der mehr und mehr dem Kommerz geopfert wird. Aber noch ist es einigermaßen ruhig und Tobias kann erklären, was es mit dem roten Gestein und dem auffällig rundlichem Hügel auf sich hat. Der Strand liegt vor einem ehemaligen Vulkanschlackenkegel, der in der Mitte auseinander geschnitten ist. Man kann noch gut den ehemaligen, nun felsigen Lavasee erkennen, der im Krater gekocht haben muss. In der bröckeligen Wand aus feinen Lavakörnern („Lapilli“) hängen Lavabomben, die bei Explosionen aus dem Krater flogen und eine aerodynamische Form annahmen.Unten am Strand sucht Tobias nach kleinen Achaten. Er ist seit seiner Jugend eifriger Mineraliensammler und findet seltene Mineralien auch an Stellen, an denen sie keiner vermutet. Sein Blick ist nicht nur für seltene Steine geschärft. Gleich darauf entdeckt er einen gut erhaltenen Häutungsrest einer seltenen Schlange. Die sind auf Santorin extrem selten und ungiftig. Meist handelt es sich um die wunderschön gezeichnete Leopardnatter, die vom Aussterben bedroht ist. Der Weg führt bald an einem Steilhang entlang, der vor Urzeiten entstand, als die Gegend noch unter dem Meeresspiegel lag. Damals floss Lava unter dem Meer aus und hinterließ kissenförmige Ablagerungen („Pillow-Lava“), auf denen sich durch heiße, mineralreiche Lösungen Kieselsäureablagerungen sammelten. Achat und weißer Opal sind an vielen Stellen zu entdecken. Leider nicht in Edelsteinqualität oder viel zu klein für Tobias Sammelleidenschaft.Bald geht’s über ein Feld, auf dem Pferde grasen und an der Kapelle Agia Markela vorbei. Auf einem Fahrweg spaziert die Gruppe bergauf. Am Rand gibt es interessante Schichten vulkanischer Asche und an einer Bimswand künstlich angelegte Höhlen. Kleine Trichter im Lavasand erregen die Aufmerksamkeit der Gäste. In ihnen spielen sich kleine Dramen ab, wenn mal wieder eine Ameise zu unvorsichtig war und in den kleinen Krater stürzte. Unten wartet gierig mit seinen Zangen der Ameisenlöwe, ein Insekt im Lavenstadium.Bei einem dunkelgrünen Baum entdeckt Tobias leckere, tiefrote Früchte. Diese Sorte ist an Aroma kaum zu übertreffen und alle versuchte vorsichtig die Beeren vom Baum zu pflücken. Leider sind diese eine „Fehlkonstruktion“ der Natur. Sie haben keine Sollbruchstelle und platsch hat man einen tiefroten Flecken auf der Kleidung und die Maulbeere zerplatzt. Die Hände sehen nach diesem kulinarischen Höhepunkt aus, als ob man ein blutiges Verbrechen begangen hat. Zum Glück haben sich alle nur an lecker süßen Beeren vergangen…Auf dem Fahrweg geht’s zu einem Hügel, der vor Urzeiten durch eine aufsteigende Magmakammer gehoben wurde. Vorher war alles unter dem Meer. Auf dem Weg erkennt man an einigen Stellen kleine Lavaschlote und auch das rötlichbraune Dach dieser Magmakammer. Bei der Kapelle Taxiarches machen wir kurz Halt, um dort nach versteinerten Muscheln zu suchen, die im vulkanischen Tuff konserviert wurden. Leider hat ein Hund an der Kapelle ein Kaninchen gerissen und so hält es uns nicht lange dort. Da freuen wir uns lieber über die frische Luft und den Duft der Kapernbüsche, die wie tropische Blüten die Trockensteinmauern bedecken. Bald erreichen wir einen kleinen Bauernhof. Dort drischt ein Bauer mit einem Helfer den Weizen. Ein Anblick wie vor hundert Jahren! Auf dem runden Dreschplatz ist in der Mitte eine Achse und dort sind in der Reihe nach ihrer Größe drei kleine Esel und zwei Maultiere angebunden. Und sie laufen im Kreis über den Weizen. Ein Bild, das es vielleicht bald nicht mehr so zu sehen gibt, wenn diese Generation an Santorinern nicht mehr lebt.Es geht bald über die Weinfelder weiter und immer wieder heben wir kleine, bläuliche Stücke calcedonüberzogener Lavastücke vom Boden. Auch diese Quarzverbindung wurde unterseeisch durch mineralreiche Thermen abgelagert. Auf den Feldern sieht man die, wie kleine Körbe am Boden gebundenen Reben. Im August ist dann Lese. Santorin-Wein sollte man vor Ort in typischen Tavernen genießen. Und da ist die Taverne von Kapitän Dimitris genau richtig. Ideal für eine erste Pause.Später geht es weiter zum Kap Akrotiri mit einer Schlucht, über die in halsbrecherischer Weise ein Haus direkt an den Abbruchrand gebaut wurde. Es wird einem schon schwindlig, das aus sicherer Entfernung zu sehen. Wie man dafür eine Baugenehmigung erhält, ist ein Rätsel…Nach zwanzig Minuten ist das Kap mit dem Leuchtturm von Akrotiri erreicht. Überall geht es steil zum Meer hinunter und auf einer kleinen Kuppe liegt blütenweißer Bims. Ein tolles Motiv mit dem Leuchtturm im Hintergrund. Auch geologisch gibt es viel zu sehen. Da ist der Bims, der ein durch explosive Gase zu Schaum aufgeblasenes Vulkangestein ist, Meeresablagerungen mit feinsten, fossilen Schwammnadeln, Reste von Lavaschloten und Asche. Der Leuchtturm ist auch ein beliebtes Ausflugsziel und so ist man hier selten allein. Alle paar Minuten kommen irgendwelche Motorräder oder Mietautos vorbei. Kaum einer der Besucher hat ein Auge für die geologischen Details, die Tobias erklärt.Und auch die Aussicht ist grandios, denn man blickt tief in die Kaldera mit ihren hunderten Lava-Schichten. Und in der Mitte droht der jüngste Vulkan Griechenlands, der später noch besucht wird. Doch jetzt geht erst mal zu Kapitän Dimitris Taverne zurück. Dort gibt’s frischen Fisch, leckere Tomatenpuffer und den santoriner Bauernsalat mit viel Kapern. Der Durst wird mit leckerem Inselwein gelöscht und zum Nachtisch hat Barbara, die Frau von Dimitris eine leckere Süßigkeit aufgetischt. Normalerweise kommt kaum ein Gast auf die Idee, was da so tief orange auf dem Tellerchen serviert wird. Aber diesmal sind die Gäste kulinarisch besonders gebildet und finden schnell heraus, dass es eine Karottenmarmelade ist. Jede der urigen Familientavernen auf Santorin hat ihre Spezialität. Die eine macht schmackhaften Hammelbraten, die andere die besten Tomatokeftedes und die dritte leckeren Fisch. Nur darf man nicht dort hingehen, wo die Touristen-Massen sind.Nach dem Essen geht es über die Felder wieder zurück nach Akrotiri und am leckeren Maulbeerbaum vorbei.Heute geht es nach dem Frühstück zu einem ehemaligen Bimssteinbruch, der bis in die siebziger Jahre in Betrieb war. Bims war eines der wichtigsten Produkte der Insel und wurde als Zusatzstoff für hydraulischen Zement auch für den Bau des Suez-Kanals verwendet.Der Abstieg in den ehemaligen Steinbruch ist etwas steil, aber alle schaffen das ohne Probleme. In dem Meer aus Felsen, Sanddünen und bei Steilhängen kann Tobias viele geologische Details erklären. Es gibt zum Beispiel die Grenzschicht des minoischen Vulkanausbruchs im Jahr 1627 v.Chr. zu entdecken. Hier sieht man den ursprünglichen Boden und darüber bis zu 60 m hellweißen Bims. Genau in dieser dünnen Grenzschicht findet man Reste der ersten europäischen Hochkultur. Die Minoer waren eine Supermacht, die damals das Mittelmeer beherrschte und deren Kunst sich in den Ausgrabungen von Akrotiri dokumentiert.Und auch diesmal klappte es! Ein kleines Messerchen aus Obsidian wird gefunden. Ein tolles Gefühl, etwas in den Händen zu halten, das vor 4000 Jahren ein wichtiges Werkzeug war. Und weitere Entdeckungen folgen. Es gibt eine Stelle, an der man auf dem Boden weiße Verästelungen erkennt. Dies sind fossile Wurzeln, die irgendwann von vulkanischer Asche bedeckt wurden. Eine der Sehenswürdigkeiten ist die bis zu 40 m hohe Wand aus dem Bims der minoischen Eruption. In ihr kann man auch größere Felsen entdecken, die bei dem Ausbruch um 1627 v.Chr. aus dem Krater geschossen wurden. Dass diese vulkanischen Bomben noch heute gefährlich werden können, erleben wir einige Minuten später, als wir die Felswand verlassen haben. Einer der Felsen löst sich aus der Felswand, unter der wir Minuten vorher standen und kracht in die Tiefe. Wir haben großes Glück gehabt und in Zukunft wird da keine Gruppe mehr in direkte Nähe gebracht. Erst, als wir abends wieder im Hotel sind und Tobias ins Internet kommt, erfährt er, dass es an diesem Tag ein Erdbeben gab und deshalb wohl auch der Felsbrocken locker wurde. Die Wanderung führt die Gruppe über ein paar Felder und bald zu einem kleinen Plateau. Dort wartet schon einen nette Frau, in deren Supermarkt Tobias vorher Zutaten für ein Picknick bestellt hatte. So nimmt sich jeder eine Tüte, denn in einer Bucht wird es später ein leckeres Mittagessen geben.Gleich geht der kleine Pfad in die Tiefe, führt durch einen tiefen Hohlweg im Bims und erreicht eine kleine Kapelle. Vorher bestaunen alle ein natürliches Fenster, das der Wind aus dem lockeren Bims geblasen hat. Hier hat man einen eingerahmten Blick der Kaldera von Santorin. Durch die zahllosen Asche- und Lavaschichten geht es immer tiefer in die Kaldera hinab. Bald erreicht die Gruppe einen Punkt, an dem man die ältesten Gesteine der Insel Santorin bestaunt. Uralte Glimmerschiefer und Kalk waren schon viele Millionen Jahre vor den ersten Vulkanen hier. Allmählich hat man einen Blick auf Terrassenfelder, die bis vor wenigen Jahren mit Weizen, Gemüse und Fava-Erbsen bebaut wurden. Es gibt ein paar runde Dreschplätze und sogar eine Palme. Unten an der Felsküste stehen ein paar einsame Häuschen und in den steilen Fels ist eine weitere Kapelle gebaut. Das ist das Ziel. Unter einem der Häuschen gibt es eine bedachte Terrasse und einen Tisch. Dort bereiten wir unser Picknick vor. Es gibt kretischen Zwieback, den man vor dem Genuss mit Wasser aufweicht, Tomatensalat mit viel Kapern und natürlich typischen Wein aus Santorin.Bis vor wenigen Jahren trafen Tobias und sein Partner Tom Pfeiffer hier noch Katerina und ihren Mann Parthenios. Sie bereiteten immer leckere Spezialitäten zu, wenn Tom und Tobias mit ihren Wandergruppen hier Pause machten. Leider starb vor wenigen Jahren Parthenios und so ist auch das Geschichte. Trotzdem ist jeder Ausflug in diese wenig bekannte Ecke der Insel Santorin weiterhin ein Höhepunkt der Santorin-Wanderstudienreisen. Auch dieses Mal genießt jeder die Ruhe und das kristallklare Wasser ist ideal, um sich von der Wanderung zu erfrischen. Später geht es noch in die kleine Bucht, in der Parthenios ein kleines Bad eingerichtet hat. In ihm fließt warmes Thermalwasser in ein kleines Becken. Daneben kann man sogar Kupfermineralien wie Malachit entdecken, die einige der Felsen überziehen. Mineralogisch ist diese Gegend sehr interessant, denn in den ältesten Gesteinen Santorins gibt es sehr seltene Talk-Vorkommen und man muss aufpassen, wohin man tritt. Talk ist ein Schmiermittel und schnell ist man auf einer Talk-Ader ausgerutscht. In der minoischen Zeit bekamen wertvolle Vasen durch Talk einen weißen Überzug. Noch heute kann man einige davon im neuen, archäologischen Museum in Thira besichtigen.Gegen Nachmittag wird ein kleiner, orange Punkt auf dem Meer gesichtet. Es ist Sostis, ein Freund von Tom und Tobias, der die Gruppe von der abgelegenen Küste abholt. Er ist der einzige, der sich traut, mit seinem Boot an der Felsenküste anzulegen. Bald geht es los und er tuckert an der Küste entlang. Jetzt kann man viele Lavaschichten der Kalderawand und alte Fördertürme der Bimsgewinnung aus der Nähe betrachten. An einem Strand bei Akrotiri legt er an und Tagmar, Traude, Ingo, Udo und Tobias machen eine Pause in der Taverne Remezzo. Später geht’s hoch zum Dorf und zum Hotel zurück.Tag 4Tobias Lieblingswanderung startet im Hauptort der Insel Santorin. Thira ist das wichtigste Touristen-Ziel. Und das merkt die Gruppe gleich beim Ausstieg am Busplatz. Mengen an Touristen drängen sich durch die Gassen und werden von windigen Reiseleitern in die Juweliergeschäfte geleitet. Tobias und seine Gäste ziehen da das neue archäologische Museum vor. In ihm gibt es gleich am Anfang einige interessante, geologische Schätze. Vor einigen Jahren hat man in einem Steinbruch bei Thira versteinerte Abdrücke von Palmen, Oliven und Myrteblättern in ca. 30.000 – 60.000 Jahre alten Ascheschichten entdeckt. Sogar Parasiten konnte man noch auf Olivenblättern feststellen! Weiter geht es an einer Vitrine mit sogenannten Kykladen-Idolen, kleine, einfache figürliche Darstellungen von Göttergestalten. Diese kleinen Marmor-Figuren sind schon in der Zeit vor 2500 v.Chr. ein künstlerisches Zeugnis der Ureinwohner von Santorin. Tobias zieht es besonders zu einer Vitrine, in der man minoische Opfergefäße in Form von Schweineköpfen ausstellt. Ähnliche Gefäße hat man auf Tobias ehemaliger Wahlheimat Methana aus mykenischer Zeit (ca. 1600-1200 v.Chr.) entdeckt. Ein deutliches Zeichen, wie sehr die beiden konkurrierenden Kulturen Griechenlands Ähnlichkeiten haben. Und später, nach dem Sieg über König Minos auf Kreta, übernahmen die Festlandsbewohner der Peloponnes, die Mykener die Macht über das Mittelmeer und seine Nachbarregionen.Neben den wunderschönen, minoischen Wandmalereien führt Tobias die Gruppe am Ausgang des Museums noch zu einem sensationellen Fund der letzten Jahre. Man hatte in den Ausgrabungen in Akrotiri einen kleinen Widder aus purem Gold gefunden – einer der wenigen, Gold-Funde. Die meisten Wertgegenstände hatten die Bewohner der vorgeschichtlichen Stadt bei ihrer Flucht vor dem Vulkan mit sich genommen. Leider ist die Ausgrabung der minoischen Stadt bei Akrotiri seit dem Einsturz des neu und mit Eu-Mitteln errichteten Schutzdaches geschlossen. Damals starb ein englischer Tourist und seitdem tut sich nichts mehr. Einer schiebt die Schuld für den Einsturz auf den anderen. Was war die Ursache für den Einsturz? Man wollte das neue Dach „ökologisch“ gestalten und bedeckte Teile davon mit einem Rasen. Dieser muss natürlich gegossen werden. Und Wasser ist schwer. Da hat man wohl in den statischen Berechnungen diese zusätzliche Belastung nicht eingerechnet. Oder das Baumaterial der Träger war von minderer Qualität und brach vor dem berechneten Punkt. Immer wieder wird am Bau gepfuscht, weil jemand mehr Profit machen will, als in den Verträgen zugesichert ist. Und da wird an den wichtigsten Stellen gespart. Ob und wann die ganze Wahrheit über die Ursachen dieses Unfalls an das Tageslicht kommen wird, ist eine große Frage.Als Alternative zur Besichtigung der berühmten Ausgrabung, nutzen Tom und Tobias bei ihren Touren das Nomikos-Ausstellungszentrum im oberen Teil Thiras. Dazu geht es erst mal durch die Masse, die aus den Kreuzfahrtschiffen nach oben in die Shop-Gasse geleitet wird. Pro Tag können 3-6 riesige Kreuzfahrtschiffe ihre menschliche Ladung hier ausspucken. Eine Masse konsumwütiger, wenig informierter Gäste wird in Läden gelotst, mit denen die jeweiligen Reiseleiter Verträge haben. Die Zeche zahlt der Gast. In Thira merkt man das am Preisniveau. Da kann ein einfacher Filterkaffee schon mal das Doppelte von Athen kosten. Tobias kennt das und wandert mit den vier Gästen zielstrebig an der überfüllten Seilbahnstation vorbei. Es wird etwas steiler und schon ebbt der Strom der Touristen ab. Jetzt trifft man fast nur noch auf Leute, die entweder auf Santorin im Hotel wohnen, Wanderer und Einheimische. Bald ist das rötliche Gebäude erreicht, dass ein reicher Reeder der Insel als Konferenz- und Ausstellungsgebäude vermacht hat. Dort hat man vor einigen Jahren eine Ausstellung der minoischen Wandmalereien eröffnet. Natürlich sind es keine Originale. Die sind zum Hauptteil im Nationalmuseum in Athen. Aber mit einer speziellen Fototechnik der Firma Kodak hat man Fotoreproduktionen der Malereien auf einem speziellen Fotomaterial gemacht. Dabei lässt sich die Fotoschicht später auf eine dreidimensionale Unterlage übertragen und eine fast naturgetreue Reproduktion entsteht. Bis vor 2-3 Jahren sah alles fast wie die Originale aus. Irgendwas muss man allerdings mit der Klimatisierung der Räume falsch gemacht haben. Inzwischen hat die Fotoemulsion deutliche Trockenrisse bekommen und man erkennt, dass es sich „nur“ um Kopien handelt. Trotzdem ist die Ausstellung sehenswert. Denn so nahe kommt man den Originalen im Nationalmuseum in Athen nicht. Und viele der Gemälde sind auch nirgends ausgestellt.Bevor alle die Ausstellung verlassen, bleibt noch ein Blick auf Fotos, die bei den Ausgrabungen in Akrotiri um 1970 gemacht wurden.Bald geht es auf dem Kalderaweg weiter nach Firostefani mit seinen Luxushotels an der steilen Kalderawand. Nach Imerovgli sind die Wanderer dann unter sich und genießen den Blick auf den meergefüllten Kraterkessel von Santorin. Am Wegrand duftet Thymian und irgendwo hat ein Bauer ein Maultier geparkt. Nach etwa einer halben Stunde erreichen Udo, Ingo, Tagmar, Traude und Tobias den Gipfel des kleinen Vulkans Profitis Ilias mit einer hübschen Kapelle. Dort werden wegen der großartigen Lage viele Hochzeiten gefeiert. Quasi „Hochzeit auf dem Vulkan“, denn hier war vor mehr als 60.000 Jahren der Gipfel eines Kraters. Heute ist die Hälfte davon im Meer versunken. Inzwischen hat man den Wanderweg mit einem Steinplattenweg aufwändig erneuert und quasi eine „Wanderautobahn“ geschaffen. Gar nicht so schlecht, denn nun hat man mehr Möglichkeiten die Landschaft zu genießen und muss nicht dauernd aufpassen, wohin man tritt. In der Mitte dieser Wanderroute befindet sich an der Strasse ein kleiner Wohnwagen, den Pavlos zu einem Café umgebaut hat. Er lebt dort fast das ganze Jahr über und bietet frischen Orangensaft und selbstgemachten Nusskuchen an. Immer ein idealer Zwischenstopp!Danach hat man wieder genug Energie, um die Vulkane Mavro Vouno und Kokkino Vouno zu besteigen. Bis zu ihnen sind es nur ein paar hundert Meter. Tobias schaut mit scharfem Blick die Steinmauern am Wegrand an, denn vor einem Jahr hat er dort ein seltenes Stück Skarngestein mit großen, grünen Pyroxenkristallen gefunden. Ein extrem seltener Fund auf Santorin! Skarn ist etwas ganz Besonderes, denn er entsteht, wenn ein Kalkfelsen in eine Magmakammer gerät. Dort wird er unter hohem Druck und hohen Temperaturen zu diesem hellgelben, körnigen Gestein umkristallisiert, das dann reich an Granat, Pyroxen oder anderen seltenen Mineralien ist. Tobias Schorr findet auf fast jeder Wanderstudienreise seltene Mineralien, archäologische Fundstücke oder seltene Pflanzen. Als Mineraliensammler hat er schon früh seine Augen für die feinsten Details trainiert. Er geht mit seinen Gästen zur Kapelle Zoodohos Pigis (griech. = „lebensspendende Quelle“), macht ein paar Fotos und dann führt er die Wanderer zu einer Stelle, an der er immer wieder archäologische Reste aus minoischer und klassischer Zeit entdeckt. Meist sind es Scherben mit Linien oder einfachen Verzierungen. Bein einer vorherigen Santorin-Tour entdeckte ein 16 Jähriges Mädchen eine Scherbe mit einem Tänzer auf einer schwarzfigurigen Scherbe aus der Zeit um 700 v.Chr. Alle diese Entdeckungen bezeugen, dass auf und um den Gipfel des Mavro Vouno in antiker und vorgeschichtlicher Zeit Heiligtümer gewesen sein müssen. Vielleicht würden systematische Ausgrabungen hier neue Erkenntnisse über die Besiedlungsgeschichte Santorins bringen…Vom Mavro Vouno genießt man auch eine wunderschöne Aussicht. Unter ihm erstreckt sich in nördlicher Richtung das schönste Dorf Santorins. Ia ist auf allen Postkarten zu finden. Und von hier oben hat man einen tollen Blick auf den Sonnenuntergang. Kurz davor erreicht die Gruppe die Windmühle von Ia und bei Spyros und seiner Familie erholen sich alle bei leckeren Souvlaki-Spießen und einem Glas Mythos-Bier von den Strapazen.Ganz früh am Morgen trifft sich die Gruppe mit Sostis am Strand von Akrotiri. Sein Boot ist ideal für jedes Wetter und man hat sogar ein Sonnendach für heiße Tage. Es geht direkt in die Mitte der Kaldera. Dort ist die jüngste Vulkaninsel Griechenlands das Ziel. Vor den Touristenmassen anzukommen ist ein Highlight, denn so kann Tobias die Gruppe in Ruhe zu allen interessanten Punkten führen. Im kleinen Hafen der Insel legt Sostis an und es geht steil einen Lavapfad bergauf. Das erste Ziel ist der Krater, der im 15 Jahrhundert als erster die Insel Mikri Kameni bildete, dann geht es an dem Explosionskrater Daphni vorbei und zum Georgios-Krater. Dort steigt Tobias in den ehemaligen Krater und bringt ein Stück kristallinem Schwefel von den Fumarolen mit. An diesen heißen Gasaustritten wächst Schwefel in einer Form, die Schneekristallen ähnelt. Etwa 50 Meter davon befindet sich der Austrittspunkt der Lava von 1950 – ein Meer aus tiefschwarzen, schuppigen Lavafelsen. Ein Krater ist nicht erkennbar. Vom höchsten Punkt der Insel Nea Kameni gibt es einen Blick auf die etwas ältere Vulkaninsel, die zum ersten Mal 46 n.Chr. an die Meeresoberfläche gelang und heute Palea Kameni genannt wird. Sie ist später das Ziel für eine längere Pause. Davor geht’s zum Boot zurück und Sostis fährt in eine abgelegene, enge Bucht der Insel Nea Kameni. Gar nicht so leicht, da mit dem Boot einzufahren. Aber der Kapitän ist das gewohnt. Dort hat Sosti eine Anlegestelle gebaut, an der er Massagen und Meditation anbietet. Er macht das Boot fest und, wer will, springt ins Wasser. Denn überall ist der rötlichbraune Boden mit warmen Gasaustritten bedeckt. Und der eisenhaltige Schlamm ist ein ideales Hautpflegemittel. Tagmar, Traude, Ingo und Udo genießen die warmen Quellen und ohne Hast kann man sich hier erholen. Nach einer Stunde hat jeder genug und es geht rüber zur Hausinsel von Sostis. Er ist quasi der einzige Vulkanbesitzer Griechenlands und auch der einzige menschliche Bewohner von Palea Kameni. Ganz alleine ist er nicht und bei Ankunft in seinem Hafen grüßt schon mit lautem Bellen Sokrates. Sein Hund ist trotz Leibesfülle noch als Schäferhund erkennbar. Er freut sich über die seltenen Besucher. Über eine Treppe geht es zu einer kleinen Bucht, an der Sosti ein Häuschen mit einem Schattendach gebaut hat. Auch dort gibt es Thermalquellen, aber alle haben erst mal genug vom Heilwasser. Auf dem Tisch gibt’s mitgebrachte Tomaten, Zwieback und Sostis selbstgemachten Ziegenkäse. Dazu wird Sostis leckerer Hauswein gereicht. Ab und zu wird die Stille von herabfallenden, schieferartigen Lavastücken unterbrochen. Sostis verlässt die Gruppe, denn seine Ziegen kommen zurück und wollen frisches Wasser. Man staunt, an welchen steilen Felsen die Ziegen herabsteigen. Wie Akrobaten springen sie von Fels zu Fels.Inzwischen hört man ein Touristenschiff, auf dem die Reiseleiterin über Lautsprecher Informationen über die Bucht mit den Thermen herunterleiert. Hier können die Touristen dann mal schnell schwimmen. Die „heißen“ Thermalquellen sind ihr Ziel. Ein Dutzend neugieriger Leute springt ins Wasser und es gibt einen Wettkampf, wer zu erst in der roten Bucht ist. Die Ruhe am Picknickplatz ist dahin und Tobias lästert mit seiner Gruppe über die gehetzten Massen, die nun das klare Wasser in eine rötliche Brühe verwandeln. Schon nach wenigen Minuten werden die hektischen Besucher per Trillerpfeife oder Schiffshorn zurückgeholt. Es dauert kaum zwanzig Minuten und das nächste Ausflugsboot kommt in der Bucht an und das Schauspiel wiederholt sich.Tobias und seine vier Gäste begreifen, dass ihre Tour im Gegensatz zu diesen Massenausflügen ein ganz exklusives Erlebnis ohne Hektik ist.Sie haben viel Zeit, um Palea Kameni zu erkunden und als nächstes zeigt ihnen Tobias den Kratersee eines Vulkanausbruchs um 726 n.Chr. Im tiefgrünen Kratersee will Sostis Langusten ausgesetzt haben. Ob sie im schwefelhaltigen, trüben Wasser überlebt haben, ist ein begründeter Zweifel.Der Vulkanausbruch dieses Kraters muss damals Asche bis nach Kleinasien getrieben haben und auch in Zukunft sind Vulkanausbrüche auf Nea Kameni und auf Palea Kameni möglich. Ob sich Sostis dieser Gefahr wirklich bewusst ist? Jederzeit kann das kleine Paradies, das er geschaffen hat, zerstört werden. Zumindest lässt ihn die griechische Bürokratie bisher ohne Probleme auf dieser einsamen Insel leben. Er hat dort Gärten, Zisternen und kleine Häuschen gebaut. In einem lebt er an dem kleinen Naturhafen und träumt davon eine nette Touristin kennenzulernen, die mit ihm auf seinem Vulkan leben möchte…Am späten Nachmittag geht’s nach Akrotiri zurück und am Abend erinnern sich alle bei leckerem Wein und Margaritas Tomatokeftedes an den tollen Ausflug.Tag 6Pyrgos ist ein Dorf, das wie eine Burg auf einer Bergspitze über Santorin thront. Und tatsächlich war der oberste Teil des Ortes früher eine Schutzfestung, in der sich die Bewohner bei Seeräubergefahr flüchten konnten. Durch die kleinen Gassen geht’s aufwärts und oben zeigt Tobias ein paar Mauerreste, die eindeutig bezeugen, dass auf dem Gipfel auch in antiker Zeit Gebäude gewesen sein müssen. Die kunstvoll behauenen Marmorsteine und ein paar Säulenreste sind der Beweis. In Griechenland ist das eigentlich normal, dass auf einem Berggipfel immer ein Tempel oder eine Festung (Akropolis) lag. Auf dieser Wanderung wird der Reiseleiter noch viele antiken Reste vorstellen und auf dem Wanderweg treffen alle erst einmal auf eine uralte Tradition der Santoriner.Zwei Bauern stehen auf einem runden Dreschplatz und trennen das Korn von der Spreu. In diesem Fall ist es kein Weizen, sondern die gelben Erbsen, die hier auch Fava genannt werden. Sie hat man als verkohlte Reste schon in den minoischen Trümmern von Akrotiri gefunden. Also wird diese Erbsenart schon mehr als 4000 Jahre genutzt. Und abends ist das immer eine wohlschmeckende und gesunde Beilage, wenn der gelbe Erbsenbrei mit Olivenöl und Zwiebeln gereicht wird. Nachdem Tobias ein paar Minuten mit den Bauern über diese wertvolle Tradition gesprochen hat, geht’s bergauf weiter und an einem ehemaligen Kloster vorbei.Am Wegrand gibt es bis zu 2 m hohes Steckenkraut, wilden Fenchel und Thymianbüsche. Heute hängen die Wolken tief und so ist der Geruch der Wildkräuter sehr stark. Es geht immer weiter hoch, bis die Strasse zum höchsten Gipfel der Insel erreicht ist. Dort gibt es ein Kloster und einen neuen Klostergarten mit einer kleinen, schönen Kapelle. In einem offenen Laden kann man sich Likörwein und religiöse Literatur kaufen und hinterlässt das verlangte Geld einfach in einem Holzschlitz. Toll, welches Vertrauen die Mönche des nahen Klosters in ihre Besucher investieren!Hinter dem Kloster steht eine hässliche Radarstation der griechischen Luftwaffe und kurz vor ihr geht es an einem steilen Hang weiter. Im Frühling gibt es hier seltene Orchideen und sogar Edelweiß. Nach etwa 100 Metern hat Tobias ein Rätsel für seine vier Gäste. Irgendetwas sollen sie auf einem Felsen vor ihm erkennen. Gar nicht so einfach, denn dort kann man nur bei genauem Hinsehen einen Fuß erkennen, der wohl in antiker Zeit in einem Marmorfelsen eingemeißelt wurde.Auf einem Pfad geht es durch einen winzigen Pinienwald, über eine Bimshalde und dann zick-zack auf einem Kurvigen Weg bergab. Auf der anderen Seite kann man schon von weitem den Hügel Sellada erkennen, auf dem die antike Stadt Thera erbaut wurde. Bis dahin sind es noch etwa zwanzig Minuten und erst mal bestaunen die Gäste ein geologisches Detail, das nur ein Kenner wirklich begreift. Eine riesige Felswand ist wie mit dem Messer geschnitten und fast glatt. Hier kommt Tobias zum Einsatz und erklärt, dass es sich um einen Grabenbruch handelt. Das bedeutet, dass hier in der Umgebung ein Teil des Berges in die Tiefe gerutscht ist. Wahrscheinlich bei einem großen Erdbeben. Auch gegenüber am Eingang zur Akropolis können die Gäste das erkennen. Ein Stück „lebendiger“ Tektonik. Und jeder versteht schnell, wieso es in Griechenland so viele Erdbeben gibt. Da versinkt nämlich ein Teil der nordafrikanischen Platte unter Europa. Das geschieht im Tiefseegraben südlich von Kreta. Die aufgeschmolzenen Gesteine steigen dann in einer ringförmigen Zone nördlich der Insel Kreta in Form von Magmablasen und Vulkanen (Methana, Milos, Santorin und Nisyros sind aktive Vulkane) wieder an die Erdoberfläche. Und diese Kräfte erzeugen Spannungen und Risse in der Erdkruste, die sich immer wieder in verheerenden Erdbeben äußern.Am Weg, der auf den Gipfel der antiken Stadt Thera führt, liegt das Artemidoros-Heiligtum, das jetzt am Morgen in idealem Licht liegt. In den Kalkstein sind mehrere große Reliefs gemeißelt. Diese symbolisieren wichtige antike Gottheiten: Ein Delfin für den Gott des Meeres, Poseidon. Ein Löwe, der den Gott Apollon darstellt und ein Adler, der den Göttervater Zeus verkörpert. Neben allem ist ein Portrait des Feldherren Artemidoros zu sehen. Dieser Platz gehört zu den schönsten antiken Stätten Griechenlands. Weiter oben spaziert Tobias mit den Gästen durch den ehemaligen Markt mit seinen Geschäften und kommt dann zum kleinen Amphitheater. Es ist schön zu sehen, dass man versucht, die Ausgrabungsstätte zu erhalten und manche Gebäude teilweise zu rekonstruieren. Die Atmosphäre auf diesem Gipfel ist beeindruckend. Man blickt über die Insel, erkennt die Strände von Kamari und Perisa und kann ab und zu beobachten, wie ein Jet auf dem kleinen Flugplatz der Insel landet.Irgendwann steigt die Gruppe in Richtung Perisa hinunter. Vorher zeigt Tobias noch eine Stelle, an der man vor ein paar Jahren eine riesige, antike Statue gefunden hat. Unten in Perisa erholen sich alle am tiefschwarzen Strand und genießen das Bad in der klaren Ägäis.Tag 8.An einem schönen Juni-Morgen geht es mit dem Bus einen Kilometer weit. Irgendwo steigt Tobias mit seinen Gästen aus und es geht über Weinfelder zu einer kleinen Kapelle. Sie gibt ein ideales Fotomotiv ab. Daneben steht ein kleines Feldhaus, dessen Grundmauern auch hier auf antike Reste schließen lassen. Aber das ist heute nicht sehenswürdig. An einem kleinen Maulbeerbaum gibt es wieder Kalorien für die Wanderung. Man lässt sich die roten Beeren schmecken. Heute folgt die Route einem kleinen Bachtal, das bis vor zwei Jahren eine tief eingeschnittene Schlucht war. Leider kam einer auf die Idee, mit dem Bulldozer einen Zugang zum Meer zu schieben. Trotzdem ist die Route interessant für einen Ausflug. Denn es geht durch hohe Bimsfelsen und an einer Stelle gibt es die minoische Grenzschicht, wo gleich eine Obsidianscherbe gefunden wird. Dieses vulkanische Glas gibt es nicht auf Santorin. Es muss also in vorgeschichtlicher Zeit auf dem Seeweg von der Insel Milos hierhergebracht worden sein. Obsidian entsteht übrigens, wenn siliziumreiche Lava extrem schnell abkühlt.In der kleinen Schlucht rennen Eidechsen panikartig in alle Richtungen, wenn sich die Gruppe ihnen zu sehr nähert. Nach einigen Minuten öffnet sich die Schlucht und das Meer ist erreicht. Die Südküste bei Akrotiri ist ein Geheimtipp. Hier ist man fast immer alleine und der feine Sand ist ideal zum Liegen. Nur, wenn man ins Meer zum Baden geht, muss man vorsichtig sein. Die ersten Meter sind steinig.Die Felsen an diesem Strand sind einmalig. Sie bestehen aus bis zu 20 Meter hohen Bimsfelsen, die vom Wind und Regen bizarre Formen erhalten haben. Es gibt sogar kleine Bögen aus Bims. Ein sehr fragiles Gebilde. Deswegen sollte man sich nicht direkt unter diese Felswände zum Sonnen legen. Es kann schon passieren, dass so ein Fels in sich zusammenbricht. Für Fotografen ist hier viel geboten und sämtliche Formen sind mit etwas Phantasie zu erkennen.Auf manchen Dünen glitzert schwarzmetallischer Sand aus Magnetit-Kristallen. Mit der Lupe kann man diverse Schwermineralien im Sand erkennen. Alles Reste, die aus dem lockeren Bims gewaschen wurden. Nach etwa einer halben Stunde ist der neue Fischerhafen von Vlyhada erreicht und auf einer kleinen Strasse geht es ein paar Minuten weiter, bis ein Feldweg links abzweigt. Bald ist ein einzelnes Haus erreicht, hinter dem man ein paar antike Gräber findet. Eines ist wie ein kleiner, antiker Tempel gestaltet und daneben ist ein großer Sarkophag in den Felsen gemeißelt. Hierher verirren sich nur wenig Reisende. Und die Gruppe entdeckt schnell noch ein ganz besonderes Detail: Über einen Felsen schlängelt sich eine meterlange, aus den Fels gehauene Schlange! Bald geht es durch Felder, auf denen die leckeren, kleinen Santorin-Tomaten wachsen. Nur ein paar hundert Meter und der schwarze Strand von Perisa ist erreicht.Eine der interessantesten Touren ist eine Fahrt mit einem Boot entlang der Kaldera. Und die besten Plätze sind vorne auf Sostis Boot. Von Akrotiri fährt unser Kapitän an der Außenseite von Palea Kameni direkt zur Nachbarinsel Thirasia. Dort gibt es am Kap gleich viel zu sehen. Dort, wo nur wenig Landmasse vorhanden ist, hat sich das Meer ein kleines Tor durch die Lavaschichten gefressen. Ein toller Anblick zwischen den roten und schwarzen Gesteinsschichten! In dem kristallklaren Wasser kann man auch am Grund interessante Strukturen und immer wieder Fische beobachten. Bald kommen Felsen in Sicht, die wie Rosen erscheinen. Sie sind wohl durch Abkühlungseffekte der heißen Lava entstanden. Man fährt quasi durch den Querschnitt vieler vulkanischer Ereignisse, die die Insel Santorin gebildet haben. Die Kaldera von Santorin hat eine lange Geschichte hinter sich. Die ersten Vulkane brachen vor einer Million Jahre unterseeisch aus. Langsam erst erhoben sie sich über die Meeresoberfläche. Dann gab es wieder Ruhephasen mehrerer Tausend Jahre und dann bildeten sich große Schichtvulkane z.B. im Nordwesten des Archipels. Langsam wuchsen mehrere Vulkane zusammen, bis es wieder gigantische Explosionen gab, die Vorgänger der heutigen Kaldera bildeten. Es war ein Prozess von Zerstörung und Wiederaufbau. Dabei lagerten sich hunderte Lavaschichten ab, in denen man heute die Charakteristik des Vulkangebiets Santorin studieren kann. Auch, wenn momentan Ruhe herrscht, so liegt der letzte Ausbruch auf der Insel Nea Kameni erst ca. 58 Jahre zurück. Und, dass Santorin in Zukunft wieder Vulkanausbrüche haben wird, ist so sicher, wie das „Amen“ in der Kirche! Wann, weiß keiner. Aber es wird kommen. Und keiner kann heute schon sagen, ob es wieder ein harmloser Ausbruch wie 1950 sein wird, oder ob es eine größere Katastrophe wird.Auf der Bootsfahrt kann man sich klar werden, welche Dimensionen die Vulkane der Region haben. Und unter den Felsen, die über dem Boot vorbeiziehen, fühlt man sich recht klein. Das Boot tuckert schön langsam an der Küste entlang, damit Tobias die geologischen Details erklären kann. Nach einer Weile kommen in den Fels gegrabene Bootsschuppen ins Bild und der kleine Hafen Korfos ist erreicht. Dort legt Sostis an einem der Restaurants an, in dem später die Ausflugsboote anlegen, die die Gruppe schon auf Palea Kameni beobachten konnte. Mit dieser Vorahnung im Kopf, sucht die Gruppe das Weite und steigt die Treppen zum Hauptort der Insel Thirasia hinauf. Die harte Beinarbeit wird durch eine klasse Aussicht auf den Kraterkessel Santorins belohnt. Oben in Manolas gibt es erst mal eine Stärkung in einer Taverne, die wie ein Balkon über die Kalderaränder ragt.Später geht es durch die pittoresken Gassen mit ihren schönen, farbenprächtigen Häusern. Hier in Manolas leben viele Kapitänsfamilien. An jeder Ecke ein Fotomotiv und besonders die Dorfkirche Agios Johannis lässt die Kameras klicken. Bald geht’s bergauf zur Kirche Agios Charalambos, die Tobias mit der Gruppe besichtigt. Ingo und Tobias wagen einen Blick ins Gebeinhaus, in dem die sterblichen Überreste ganzer Familien in sorgfältig polierten und geschmückten Blech- und Holzkisten liegen. Auf Thirasia gibt es einige sehr schöne Kirchen, die nur selten von ausländischen Gästen besucht werden. Die Insel Thirasia lässt erahnen, wie Santorin vor dem Ansturm des Tourismus in den siebziger Jahren ausgesehen haben muss. Damals gab es außer Weinanbau, Seefahrt und die Bimssteinbrüche kaum Einnahmequellen für die Bevölkerung und die Insel war sehr arm. Dann kam 1956 noch das schwere Erdbeben dazu, das fast alle Dörfer zerstörte und dessen Spuren auch heute noch an ein paar Stellen zu sehen sind.Welche Kraft Erdbeben und Vulkanausbrüche entwickeln zeigt Tobias an Hand eines Felsens, der unterhalb einer wunderschönen Kapelle auf dem lockeren Bims liegt. Sein Gewicht dürfte so um die 3-4 Tonnen liegen und er wurde bei der Minoischen Vulkan-Explosion kilometerweit in die Luft geschossen. Eine Energie, die der Kraft hunderter Atombomben entsprach wurde frei. Solche riesigen Felsen sind über die ganze Region verstreut und selbst auf entfernten Inseln wie z.B. Folegandros und Ios fand man Felsbrocken aus Santorin…Auf dem Rückweg zum Hafen trifft die Gruppe auf die Ausflugsboote und deren Gäste. Und Sostis wartet schon auf Tobias, Ingo, Udo, Traude und Tagmar. Schnell verlässt er den Hafen Korfos und fährt an einer der schönsten Basalt-Rosen vorbei nach Ia.Sich Ia vom Meer zu nähern ist etwas ganz Besonderes. Oben kleben an den roten Lavafelsen die weißen Häuser und man sieht die schönsten Kirchen. An der kleinen Insel Agios Nikolaos geht’s vorbei, man sieht die Anlegestelle des Hafens Armeni und schnell entdeckt die Gruppe ein kleines Häuschen an der Küste, zu dem Rohre führen. Tobias erklärt, dass dies die Ansaugrohre für die Meerwasserentsalzungsanlage oben in Ia sind. Es gibt nur geringe Süßwasserresourcen und so hat ein reicher Exil-Santoriner der Insel diese Einrichtung geschenkt. Trotzdem bleibt Wasser ein Problem. In Tanklastern wird das nicht sehr wohlschmeckende Wasser teuer an Hotels und Privatleute geliefert. Im Vulkangestein versickert Regenwasser sehr schnell und außer im Kalkfels des Profitis Ilias gibt es keine natürlichen Süßwasserquellen.Inzwischen erreicht das Boot die interessantesten Stellen im Inneren der Kaldera. Unterhalb der Vulkane Mavro Vouno und kleiner Profitis Ilias gibt es zahlreiche tiefschwarze Gänge, die senkrecht die Lavaschichten durchschlagen haben. Es sind ehemalige Schlote und Fördergänge von Vulkanen. Manchmal sieht man, wie das Nebengestein durch die Hitze gebrannt wurde und ein rötlicher Saum entstand. Jetzt ist auch die engste Stelle der Insel erreicht. Hier ist man wieder auf der Störungszone, auf der alle aktiven Vulkane des Santorinarchipels liegen. Und einen Vulkan sieht man gar nicht. Er liegt außerhalb der Kaldera in einer Tiefe von 14-150 m unter dem Meer. Und er hatte es in sich. 1640 n.Chr. hatte er eine Eruption, bei der giftige Gase an der Küste bei Kamari und Ia viele Tiere tötete. Erst vor ein paar Jahren wurde der Grund des Vulkans mit einem Tiefseeboot erkundet und heiße Gasaustritte fotografiert. Der Grund ist mit einem Teppich schwefelverzehrender Mikroben besiedelt.Die Störung ist auch innerhalb der Kaldera weiterhin gefährlich. Schon vor zigtausenden Jahren brach ein ganzer Teil des Kleinen-Profitis-Ilias-Vulkans ab und rutschte ins Meer. Gerade an dieser Stelle hat jemand erst vor kurzem eine Villa gebaut. Kein sehr sicherer Baugrund. Aber, wer auf Santorin an der Kaldera baut, muss die geologischen Gefahren verdrängen. Jederzeit kann ein schweres Erdbeben alles zerstören.Minuten später fährt Sostis am Skaros-Felsen vorbei. Tobias erklärt der Gruppe, dass dies der Rest eines riesigen Schildvulkans ist, dessen Grenze man an den Kalderwänden an Hand der Schichtung erkennen kann. Es gibt noch alte Zeichnungen aus dem 17 Jahrhundert, die zeigen, dass auf dem Felsen Kirchen und Häuser standen. Sie sind alle in Folge von Erdbeben ins Meer gebröckelt. Inzwischen hat das Bot den Hauptort Thira erreicht und fährt zwischen riesigen Kreuzfahrtschiffen hindurch. Es geht an den langsam verrostenden Verladerutschen der Bimssteinbrüche vorbei, dann kommt der Strand von Thermia ins Auge und bald legt Sostis bei Akrotiri an.Den letzten Abend verbringt Tobias mit Ingo, Udo, Traude und Tagmar am Strand von Akrotiri. Dort bei Jiorgos und Margarita lässt er diese Reise mit leckerem Lammbraten, Fisch, Tomatokeftedes und Wein ausklingen.Fotos: © Tobias Schorr"
40,“日本の免許書を忘れずに”,美しいサントリーニ島ですが、イメージより広い島であることを理解して行かれることをお勧めします。中心街から夕焼けで有名なｏｉａまでは車で３０分ほどかかります。オフシーズンだと、公共交通機関であるバスはほとんど無く2時間に1本程度。他のビーチ等だと一日2本ということもあります。車の運転は難しいかも知れませんが、原付なら問題ないです。国際免許証でなくても受け付けてくれますので、日本の免許証を持って行きましょう。
50,“Blau und Weisses Maerchen”,"Tageueber ist es dort viel los, abends jedoch sehr ruhig.Man wird staendig von blau und weiss umgeben. besser geht ja gar nicht."
50,“梦中的天堂”,圣托里尼是我去过的所有地方最美的。简直是梦中的天堂。张开双臂，面对着火山，感受着云朵从手上飘过。。。感觉身在仙境中
50,“Det romatiska ställe jag har sätt.”,Det var det finnaste ställe vi har besökt.Inget barnvänligt! Svrt att köpa barnmat och inga micro ute på restauranger.Super bra för par!Gud ditt vill vi åka igen men utan barn!
50,“全てが絵になる島”,アテネから飛行機で行き、3泊しました。白い街並み、鮮やかなピンクのブーゲンデリア、青いドア、丸い青い屋根、石畳の道、深い色の海、素晴らしい夕焼け・・・書きつくせないほど、本当に素敵な島でした。8月に行きました。ベストシーズンだったせいもあり、世界中から観光客が訪れていました。物価は高いと思いますが、ベストシーズンのリゾート地であれば仕方ないですね。食べ物も海産物・野菜などが新鮮で美味しかったです。日本人の口に合うと思います。もしアテネまで行くことがあれば、ぜひ足を伸ばしてほしいです。日常を忘れて感動できると思います。日本から遠い場所ですが、ぜひもう1度（何度でも）再訪したい場所です。
50,“エーゲ海の三日月”,変わった島の形と絶景に憧れて、サントリーニ島に行くことに決めました。行きは飛行機で、帰りは船でした。日本からは、３回のフライトになります。夜中に到着するのはイヤだったので、ヨーロッパ内で乗り継ぐところで一泊。早朝にアテネに飛んで、アテネで乗り継いで、午後に到着。時間はかかりましたが、アテネの空港も初めてだったので乗り継ぎの時間も楽しめたし、初めて見るエーゲ海の景色は最高でした。帰りはアテネ（ピレウス港）まで船です。日本からネットで予約して、券を受け取るのが問題だったのですが、サントリーニ島のホテルまで郵送してもらいました。チェックイン時にフロントで確実に受け渡ししてもらえましたし、チケットの受け取りにはベストの方法かな、と思います。ボートはカタマランの高速船であまり揺れませんでした。途中で他の島にも寄港するので、景色が変わって楽しかったですね。時間はちょっとかかるけれど、お勧めだと思います。ピレウス港からは、少し歩いたところにある地下鉄の駅から地下鉄に乗ってアテネ市内まで簡単にアクセスできます。
50,“Une beautée sans pareille !”,"Nous sommes arrivés de Grèce , il y a deux semaines. Nous avons visité Athènes, Santorin et Mykonos.

Ces gens qui vivent dans ces îles éloignées..(.pour nous c`est loin ) et bon sens si vous saviez le nombre d`île qu`il peut y avoir....c`est incroyable..........et ce sont des gens incroyables"
50,“景色が最高！！”,景色のどこを切り取っても絵葉書になりそうな島です。夕方になると、島の最西端は夕日を見るために集まった観光客でいっぱいになります。私は、少し早めに高台のレストランに入って食事をたのしみながら夕日をみました。ゆっくり滞在したい島です。
50,“イアの夕日”,サントリーニの観光名所、イアの夕日。世界で一番美しい夕日と言われています。しかし、すごくたくさんの人人人・・・（＾＾）夕方になるとサントリーニの各場所からイアに向けてみーんな集まってきます。私は四輪バギーを借りて見に行きました。本当に人がたくさんですが、行く価値あり！です。地平線に夕日が落ちた瞬間、周囲から拍手が沸き起こっていました。
50,“santorini un piccolo presepe di Natale”,"santorini è bellissima e davvero rilassante , ma vale la pena girarla tutta in scooter naturalmente:-) al sud ci sono delle bellissime spiagge:-) Ma il paesino di Oia al Nord è un spettacolo!! Se avete le finanze che lo permettono vi consiglio di alloggiare ai Merovigli, romanticissimo e tranquillissimo!!! dipende da uno cosa vuole dalla vacanza. Invece Fira la capitale è bellissima ma più movimentata ci sono un sacco di locali carini!Io ho alloggiato al FInikia's place hotel , vicino ad Oia, non era vista Caldera ma è un piccolo ma molto carino hotel , con prezzi giusti e ragionevoli. FInikia's perchè intorno all'hotel c'erano delle bellissime piante di fico che emanavano un odore veramente gradevole.é a cinque minuti di scooter da Oia. Oia ha degli studios bellissimi ma carissimi! Il Finikia's place era veramente grazioso e tranquillo la camera dava direttamente sulla piccola ma ben tenuta piscina.Mi sono trovata benissimo le camere superior sono belle davvero, mentre io sconsiglio le camere standard, con poca spesa in più si ha una camera decisamente di un altro livello.I LOVE SANTORINI !"
50,“Luce a Santorini”,"""The paradise is here, when the sun meets the sea"" è l'inizio di una famosa canzone che meglio descrive l'incanto di ques'isola delle Cicladi. Il paesaggio vulcanico è una costante, così come pure il soffio del melteni, che ne attraversa il territorio.Firà è la capitale, centro della vita dell'isola, ricca di attrazioni per ogni genere di turista. Vi si incontrano negozi e botteghe variopinte, taverne caratteristiche, albeghi accoglienti e molteplici locali notturni. Ma ciò che più attrae di Firà, così come pure degli altri luoghi, è la luce, specie quella al tramonto.Il sole che affonda lentamente nella caldera è un'immagine indimenticabile, che tocca il cuore, che emoziona e stupisce.Si resta con lo sguardo fisso, incantato verso un simile fenomeno naturale, coccolati da una musica new age che risuona lieve tra le stradine, contorno ideale per terminare ogni giornata. Santorini, però non è solo questo. Le spiagge incorniciano un mare dal colore blu intenso: se ne trovano di roccia (come la famosa ""Red Beach"") o quelle di sabbia scura nella zona di Perissa e Kamari. Il tempo sembra scorrere lentamente e in questo modo si apprezzano alcuni scorci paesaggistici di enorme intensità. Oia è uno di questi. La sua strada principale è disseminata di varie botteghe, molte delle quali di prodotti artigianali, ma è ciò che si vede dal suo promontorio che toglie il fiato. In ogni ora del giorno è uno spettacolo di luce inimitabile. Per cui ama la storia antica si può visitare l'interessante sito archeologico di Akrotiri, per chi preferisce invece ricordi fotografici, la stradina che costeggia il mare, tra Firà e Imerovigli non è da perdere. Santorini è mare, sole e colori, anche se affascinano i paesini interni, ideali per una sosta ad una locanda o per allontanarsi dalle ondate di turismo che in estate animano tutta l'isola. Pyrgos è un borgo posto in una posizione strategica, nella parte più alta dell'isola. Curiose le stradine di pietra che portano al castello per scoprire nuovi panorami. Megalochori invece è una località più grande e piena di vita. Il suo nome significa ""grande villaggio"" e rispecchia la sua conformazione. Una sosta li meritano i 2 grandi campanili, posti proprio nella zona centrale. Il resto di Santorini è natura, silenzio. La gente riservata e accogliente rende l' isola ancora più desiderabile. Una vacanza in questo paradiso terrestre è un ricordo indelebile nel tempo."
50,"“Santorini, unica al mondo”","santorini è un'isola stupenda.Proprio come si narra nei film e nei racconti, è unica al mondo...paesaggi unici, fa addirittura dispiacere godersi le giornate di mare,perchè ci sono tantissime escursioni da fare...io ci sono stata per due settimane,ed amando molto il mare e il sole mi sono persa qualcosa...consiglio di vedere Oia sia di giorno che di sera,perchè offre davvero una vista unica...andate a ballare a Fira, dove ci sono molti locali caratteristici....per mangiare fuori consiglio Kamari...io personalmente ho soggiornato a Perissa,e mi è sembrata un'ottima scelta...un po' decentrata,ma davvero economicissima,sia a livello di alloggi,che di mezzi da fittare...i quoad costano davvero pochissimo da quelle parti...attenzione ai motorini,perchè le strade non sono ottimali,di motagna con molte curve e difficilmente protette....giratevi le varie spiagge senza farvi mancare la red baech,e magari metteteci ancheun'escursione al vulcano, che io ho saltato!!!E' un po' cara,ma basta farsi furbi...con 3 euro potrete cenare una gustosissima pita kebab take away e una bottiglina d'acqua...i kebab li cucinano DIVINAMENTE!!!"
50,“Schiffsausflug mit der PEGASUS”,"Die Insel SANTORIN ist mit Sicherheit ein Highlight - sieht man von dem ""touristischen Getümmel"" ab, das an einzigartigen Orten nicht ausbleibt. Umso erfreulicher ist es, wenn man dennoch das Glück hat, an einem der zahlreichen angepriesenen Ausflüge teilzunehmen und dabei das Geühl zu haben: Das ist's: Erlebnis, optimale Informationen - Vergnügen !!! Und das alles wurde uns geboten auf dem traditionellen Motorsegler ""PEGASUS"" mit Captain Dimitris, dem Maat Adonis und unserer Begleiterin Elfi.Die PEGASUS ist ein Schooner-Modell aus dem 18. Jh. - authentisch nachgebaut - und das einzige Ausflugsschiff, das die ganze Caldera umrundet. So taucht man neben Stopps auf verschiedenen Inseln richtig ein in die tiefen Fluten des Kratermeers. Ein Highlight ist auch die Vulkangeschichte erzählt auf der noch aktiven Insel im Zentrum des Kratermeers: äußerst informativ, lebhaft und rhetorisch einwandfrei vorgetragen !Belohnt wird man nach dem ""heißen Marsch auf den Vulkan"", dem schlammig-sprudelnden Bad in den Schwefelquellen und der tüchtigen Meeresbrise mit der kräftigen griechischen Hausmannskost auf Therasia. Untermalt und begleitet wird dieser Ausflug von zu den Natur- und historischen Szenen passender Musik - Entspannung und Erlebnis pur - was will man mehr im Urlaub ? Äußerst empfehlenswert !"
50,“ギリシャのサントリーニ島”,島全体が白を貴重とした洞窟調の建物で覆われており、所々から望める青い海とプールはとても素敵な眺望！ヨーロッパの方々のリゾート地ということもあり、ギリシャの中でもアテネのような市街地はスリなど危険がいっぱいですが、この島はそんな危険もなくかなりリッチな気分になれ、おすすめです。
50,“Ile exceptionnelle !! A decouvrir absolument.”,"Passage obligé lors d'un séjour sur les îles Cyclades. L'arrivée en ferry au port est magique, apercevoir au loin le village blanc haut perché de Fira, on croirait de la neige..Le débarquement au port est chaotique, une horde de touriste s'entrecroise dans une organisation sans queue ni tête, mais on s'en sort. Le bus nous monte jusqu'à Fira sur une route méandreuse. On y découvre des maisons blanches au volets bleues accrochés au flanc des falaises. Privilégier les déplacement en quad ou scooter pour découvrir le paysage et les petits villages afin d'être plus libres dans votre emploi du temps (les bus sont très pratiques mais les horaires peuvent être contraignants et sont loin d'être respectés..). Nous avions un hotel à l'écart de la ville, à 300m de la rue principale (hotel THIRA) ce qui nous à éviter les nuisances sonores de la foule estivale. Avec piscine, car il y a très peu de plage à Santorin. La célèbre RED BEACH est bondée, mieux vaut arriver très tôt le matin. La visite du volcan est anecdotique, rien d'extraordinaire, pas de véritable cratère...et en plus du prix de l'excursion, l'accès au volcan est payant ! (5Euro).Ne pas oublier de visiter le fabuleux village d'OIA et son coucher de soleil. A savoir qu'il est aussi beau à FIRA ou sur les autres îles...Je garde un excellent souvenir de cette île exceptionnelle!"
50,“ロマンチック”,とっても素敵な島です。是非行って下さい。食事はまずくて高いです。ちょっと眺めがいいカフェで頼んだオレンジジュースが１０００円、なんだかちっともおいしくないシーフードグリル盛り合わせ４人分が２万円って感じ。ホテルを予約する時に、ボルケーノビューとあったら、海が見える側の断崖にある部屋です。たいていはタクシーが寄せられない路地にあるので、行くのが大変です。
50,“un ristorante ottimo”,"io, mio marito, mio figlio e la ragazza siamo stati una settimana a santorini, abbiamo mangiato per 4 sere da Mama's house, un ristorante che si trova vicino alla stazione dei bus, all'inizio della città di Thira, per chi arriva da sud. abbiamo sempre speso circa 48 Euro per tutti quattro, veramente poco, piatti talmente abbondanti da non riuscire quasi a mangiare tutto. tutto molto buono, due camerieri parlano italiano, spiegano molto bene gli ingredienti dei piatti. lo consiglio a tutti."
50,“La Irrealidad Ante Mis Ojos”,"Acabo de volver hace un par de semanas de un viaje de 2 semanas por Grecia con mi marido y mi hija de 12 años y despues de un tour privado por Grecia,elegí Santorini para descansar 5 dias de relax despues del tute y el calor de la Grecia peninsular.Conocer Grecia para mi ha sido un ""viaje iniciatico"" gracias a un estupendo guia. Ahora se que es el concepto helenistico, a donde pertenece mi cultura y por lo tanto a donde pertenezco yo y lo mas importante de todo he comprendido muchas cosas que he estudiado pero que estaban inconexas en mi conocimiento de la historia de mi civilización. Gracias, Lefteris ( o como sea, el griego me resulta complicadisimo,jeje)Pero cuando por fin llegue a Santorini no me podia creer lo que habia ante mis ojos. Nos alojamos en Imerovigli ( no sabiamos que sitio elegir, pero creo que acertamos por completo), en cada atardecer que he visto siempre venia a mi mente el siguiente pensamiento: como un sitio tan hermoso que me llenaba de tanta paz podia haber sido el producto de algo tan horroroso como una enorme erupcion volcanica que acabo con una civilización. Este pensamiento chocaba en mi mente cada atardecer que pase alli y en esos moentos me superaba la emocion.Hasta ahora solo me habia enamorado de una ciudad a primera vista: Venecia, pero desde que he conocido Santorini ya tengo 2 amores en mi corazon. En cierta forma Santorini me recuerda a Venecia, sus callejitas estrechas y el agua siempre presente, esos cambios de escenario con solo variar la luz que cambia a lo largo del dia........Y ademas, mira por donde Imerovigli fue la capita de Santorini durante la dominacion veneciana.........que casualidadHe vuelto muchas veces a Venecia desde esa primera vez, y espero, deseo y hare todo lo posible para volver a Santorini.......es lo que tiene el AMORGracias a esas hermosas islas, vistas irreales y gracias a sus amables y calidas gentes.tenia muchas ganas de ir. pero la verdad es que es muuuuuuuuuuucho mas de lo que esperaba.GRACIAS GRACIAS GRACIAS"
40,“Un luogo per vivere e comodo per visitare”,"Grecia - Santorini: Kamari, HOTEL MAKARIOS 3 stelle.Data: 3 luglio al 10 luglio 2009Recensore: un membro di TripAdvisor, Manta Cuneo.Mi sono iscritto a questo viaggio, due giorni prima della sua partenza, con un last minute che faceva proprio al mio caso sia per il periodo che per la mia disponibilita finanziaria. Viaggio A/R in Aereo da Malpensa, con Pernottamento ed All Inclusive, presso l'Hotel Makarios di Kamari che dista a pochi KM dall'aeroporto. La località si trova sulla costa sud-Est dell'isola, parte opposta alla Caldera. Ho trovato il personale dell'albergo, accogliente, garbato, anche se poco disposto al servizio in caso di ""fuori orari"", vedi cene o pranzi in ritardo. Le stanze sono accoglienti e pulite, come pure gli accessori. La piscina interna attrezzata e dotata di buoni comfort, vasche idromassaggi, ombrelloni, tavolini e sdraio comodi. La crisi finanziaria si fa sentire anche qui, e specialmente sulle scelte a colazione, pranzo e cena; si nota poco ricambio di cibi, legato anche ai costi contenuti che devono mantenere per avere sempre afflussi dei clienti. Kamari ha la sua bella passeggiata sul mare, oltre due km, di negozi, bar, ristoranti. Molti punti per noleggio Scooter, indispensabile per visitare per bene tutte le numerose meraviglie dell'isola, Il nostro Tour operator era Pianeta Terra, che si è occupato di prelevarci e informarci inizialmente delle possibilità ed opportunità della vacanza, e ci ha seguito per le visite programmate. Per me, è andata bene cosi', in quanto ho noleggiato uno scooter per tre giorni ed ho girato tutta l'isola, anche di sera, e in questo modo mi sono visto i tramonti a Fira, Oia, ed Imerovigli. Attenzione ai pranzi nei localini di Fira, 60 euro due spiedini di pesce, ""Da Franco"", meglio ritornare a Kamari e cercare un localino con tavolini esterni, nelle parallele alla passeggiata a mare, dove con 4 euro si puo' mangiare un piatto di patatine ed uno spiedino con birra e caffè.Ci siamo trovati bene, chissà se fosse possibile fare un capodanno a Santorini, se c'è turismo anche d'inverno. Calimera a tutti."
40,“Ristorante syrtaki kamari”,"Siamo appena trornati da Santorini 2 ad. + 2 bamb. stupenda.....abbiamo mangiato varie volte al Ristorante taverna SYRTAKI,sul lungomare della bellissima spiaggia di Kamari, eccellente il servizio, cordiali gentili e simpaticissimi i gestori e collaboratori, ottimo il mangiare e ad un prezzo davvero onesto. Lo consigliamo a tutti....un bacione Lucia,Maurizio e Fam."
50,"“Santorini, Grecia. Un lugar de Ensueño.”","LLegamos a Santorini, Grecia en un recorrido por el Mediterraneo en Crucero. Santorini es una Isla Griega que tiene origen volcanico.Llegas en barco a la costa y en un funicular subes a la ciudad, desde ahi tienes unas vistas hermosas del Mediterraneo, con sus casas blancas con techos azules que seguramente recordaras haber visto en alguna pelicula o documental.En fin, sus calles empedradas, llenas de pequeñas boutiques, lugares donde comer o solo admirar el paisaje.Frente a la ciudad se ve lo que ellos llaman La Caldera, que es lo que queda de un volcan.La leyenda dice que esta es la antigua Atlantida.Es un sueño el lugar, lleno de paisajes, el tiempo transcurre de otra forma.Les recomiendo visitarlo."
50,“La beauté magique de Santorin en Grèce”,"Le plus bel endroit que j ai visité de ma vie, les villes de Fira et Oia ( spectaculaire) à voir. Ça ne s explique pas, il faut les voir.Marjolaine."
50,“希腊度假天堂圣托里尼岛”,圣岛上有两个主要的镇，也是游客集中所在，Thira（锡拉）和Oia（伊亚），二者之间有定期公交往来，票价1欧（or 1.5?）。我住的度假村靠近Thira，圣岛最热闹的街道在此，而Oia拥有最美的日落。于是很容易便制定路线：先Thira再Oia。反正时间充裕——实际上，踏上岛后，时钟似乎都走得慢了一圈，觉得与外界完全隔离，人不慵懒不把节奏放慢都不像话似的。虽然已经商业化得十分充分，Thira各条街道上——或者说小巷子更加确切，密布了各式旅行社，餐厅和艺术品店。但民族风格浓郁的建筑和景观，仍给人质朴而温馨的感觉。尽管也会有狡猾的导游，有势利的商铺老板，有忽悠游客的纪念品……但身居其间，这一切似乎都不重要了——在美景面前，人都会变得宽容吧。
50,“サントリーニ島なら　オイア村が一番！”,白の壁に青い屋根の家が印象的なサントリーニ島。教会もあちこちにあり、家にまで十字や金をつけるほど敬虔な信者の島です。そんな島で、一番気に入ったのは、オイア村。英語読みだとイア村。夕日が綺麗なことで有名な村です。フィラは少し雑然としていますが、オイアはかなりのんびりしています。芸術家として移り住んだ人のお店も多く、ゆったりと過ごせます。もちろん、毎日海に落ちる夕日を見にいけるのも、最高の瞬間です。
50,“ギリシャに旅行に行く際は是非☆”,私がギリシャを旅行したのは2006年の8月でした。ギリシャと言えば、で統一されているサントリーに島がよくパンフレットに載っていますね☆島全体が青と白で統一されていて、周りは真っ青な海に囲まれていてとても綺麗でした。私はどうしてもこのサントリーに島に行きたくて、現地で船の切符を買って日帰りで行ってきました。パンフレットに載ってた通り、島は青と白で、町の中心地は観光地なのでがやがやしていましたが、少し離れた所に行くととてものんびりしてて癒されました。私は日帰りだったので見れなかったのですが、島でたまたま会ったバックパッカーみたいな日本人によると、夕日が落ちる時間になると、島の先端に行って皆で夕日が落ちていくのを見るそうです。ステキですよね☆なので、サントリーに島は勿論素敵でお勧めなのですが、是非この島に泊ってこの夕日を見てください。島が段々になっているので、ホテルからも目の前に真っ青な海が広がって、きっとステキですよ！ただし、島の中心からはバスが港まで出ているのですが、時間が限られています。タクシーが沢山いるので、タクシーを使えば港に行けるのですが観光客相手なのでかなり高い金額を払わなければいけなくなります。帰りのバスの時間はちゃんとバス停で確認してから、サントリーに島観光をすることをお勧めします。
50,“やはりフィラ滞在がお薦め”,出発前にイアに滞在するか、フィラに滞在するか、随分悩みました。私共は結局フィラに決めたのですが、結果から言うと正解だったと思います。ポイントは、フィラでは夕陽の臨めるホテルに滞在できたこと、メインストリートからそれほど苦労なくホテルにたどり着けたこと、フィラの町がイアに比べて賑やかだった(大きかった）ことです。イアでも夕陽の臨めるホテルに泊まり、苦労なくたどり着けるところならば大差はないように思いますが、フィラにはいろんなタイプのレストランが数多くあるうえ、小さいがスーパーマーケットもあり、ホテルのベランダで夕陽をおかずに簡単な食事をするにもとても便利です。リーズナブルに過ごすにはこっちかなと思いました。
50,“I tramonti più romantici della grecia”,"L'isola è davvero romantica e affascinante, anche se le spiagge rocciose anche in mare non sono il massimo per chi ama la sabbia."
20,"“Santorini, che truffatori”","Mi concedo, per il mio compleanno, una breve vacanza in questa bellissima isola greca.Arriviamo giovedì 26 con volo eurofly-Meridiana. All'areoporto prendiamo un taxi, ci caricano tipo pullman, con noi due ragazze libanesi. Al centro di Fira scarica le due ragazze 12 euro (2 giorni prima ne avevano pagati 10) si lamentano dell'aumento e poi ripartiamo. Dopo 2 km tocca a noi, 15 euro. Ovviamente i taxi non hanno il tassamentro.Hotel Belvedere in Firostefani. Vista spettacolare sulla Caldera. Aimè la brutta sorpresa, la nostra stanza (uno studio vista sulla caldera) sarà pronta solo l'indomani mattina e tentano di appiopparci una stanza (se così si può definire) nel retro, con un lucernaio ( 304 € a notte). Faccio casino e l'unica cosa che otteniamo è una stanza vicino al mare in un'altro hotel del loro gruppo. Hotel aegean plaza - Kamari. L'hotel è nuovo però non ha la vista Caldera , ne tantomeno mare. La colazione è da villaggio Bravo il 15 di Agosto. Ci fanno il transfer al nostro Hotel e finalemnte ci assegnano una stanza vista mare (tra tutte la peggiore ed il giorno prima ci aveva assicurato che avremmo avuto la stanza migliore per compensare). Non voglio rovinarmi la vacanza quindi non faccio ulteriore polemica.Noleggiamo una macchina (cosa consigliabile) Tony's car tra Fira e Firostefani è gentile e bravo.Tra gite e cene, di merito una taverna greca nel centro di firostefani ( si mangia tipico greco a prezzi ottimi), sempre nel centro di Firostefani (con terrazza stupenda) trovate un'altro ristorantino dove si mangia benissimo, il Vanilia.Ad Oia Fanari Villas. Albergo meraviglioso con ristorante e vista sul tramonto unico al mondo.Vi segnalo, inoltre, IL PEGGIORE E CARO ristorante di santorini Fira, sullo scontrino c'è scritto Kristin ma credo che il ristorante abbia un'altro nome. Lo riconoscete perchè tra gli ultimi, nella parte più bassa della caldera. e' riconoscibile dalla grotta con le griglie e la verdura e pesce sulla strada. L'idea è quella di poter mangiare un'ottima grigliata di carne o pesce en invece è veramente tremendo oltre al fatto che è uno tra i più cari ristoranti che io abbia incontrato nella mia vita. Vi dico solo che 1 filetto ( doveva essere filetto di manzo ed invece sembrava carne di mulo dura e pessima), un piatto di verdure grigliate, 1 piatto di cozze (sembrava mezza porzione) 1 bottiglia d'acqua (non abbiamo bevuto vino)e un piatto di pollo in una salsa orrenda. Costo dell'operazione 180,00 euro. Il giorno seguente abbiamo incontrato una coppia che è stata nello steso ristorante e ci hanno detto che 1 aragosta e un piatto di polipo bollito e 1 bottiglia di vino locale gli è costata 300,00 euro.Roba da veri truffatori. In questa breve vacanza abbiamo notato che la media è di truffatori."

50,“suggerimenti per una vacanza da favola a santorini”,"per l'alloggio vi consiglio una villetta privata; io mi sono affidata all'agenzia locale ""villas & mansions of santorini island"" che mi ha procurato via internet una splendida villetta in una zona poco turistica ma davvero cartteristica, megalochori (la zona del vino, cantine sparse per tutto il paesino ed un'atmosfera fuori dal tempo, i colori bianco e blu dominano tutta l'area, le vigne incorniciano il paesaggio);per il cibo vi consiglio Feredini per una cena od un pranzo speciale (vista mozzafiato, ad Oia); Il decantato Selene , a Fira, risponde alle aspettative ma è piuttosto caro; e poi, fermatevi nelle tarttorie tipiche e degustate il pesce e tutte le altre delizie di questa terra (i ristoranti sul mare alla Baia di Ammoudi, le trattorie e le taverne sparse lungo le varie spiagge dell'isola....); per ballare, discoteca casanova a fira, la più ricercata per selezione musicale.per girare l'isola lo scooter non è iol mezzo migliore: scegliete una jeep e partite alla scoperta di tutte le spiagge della costa.un viaggio indimenticabile da condividere con persone davvero care, come è stato per me."
