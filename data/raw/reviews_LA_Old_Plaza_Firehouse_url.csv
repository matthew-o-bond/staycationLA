30,I dissent from the glowing reviews - this is a 'look into' not a museum,"Really, it's one large fire engine and one rather interesting very small and early pumper. But the history you come away with is largely what you take in. If you are in the square at Olvera drop by, but don't make this a destination.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scottrA3361XW
50,Historical,"The museum is quite small, but it's free and interesting so definitely worth a visit if you're nearby.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TPAT75
50,Most informative and interesting,"In the days when many buildings were wooden and thus in great risk of devastating fires the firemen and engines stationed here were key in helping to save lives.It was built in 1884 and served as a fire station only until 1897, largely because motorised fire engines were then becoming more common.During those many years until becoming a museum in 1960 it has had many uses, including saloon, market and drugstore.It has an evocative collection of fire engines and artefacts, all aided by the great guides who were always ready to relate aspects of its history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/permia
50,Neat Firefighting History,"Very interesting stop. We were pushed for time as we were part of a larger tour, but this is a fascinating stop to learn the history is LAâ€™s first firefighters.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hokiechip
40,Fascinating journey through the evolution of firefighting,"Located in El Pueblo de Los Angeles Historical Monument, the Old Plaza Firehouse was built in 1884 and is today a museum that showcases 19th century fire fighting equipment. Right until mid-19th century, the City of Los Angeles had no fire department, firefighting equipment or fire stations.If a fire broke out, the neighbours pitched in to put it out. This obviously was an unsatisfactory state of affairs and in 1869, local citizens decided to create a volunteer fire department.After the first group of volunteers resigned since the city was unwilling to buy horses to pull the fire engine, two volunteer companies called Volunteer 38s (with 38 members) and Confidence No. 2 were formed.The two volunteer companies apparently competed to see who could arrive first at the scene of a fire! This also coincided with the City Council agreeing to buy a pair of horses to draw the fire engine.The Plaza Firehouse was the very first fire station built in Los Angeles to house firefighters and firefighting equipment. Architect William Boring designed the structure.The horses were stabled inside the fire station on the ground floor and a turntable on the floor (clearly visible in the pictures attached to this review) dispensed with the problem of backing the horses in or out!The firefighters were on the higher floor and when the fire alarm sounded, they slid down a brass pole to the ground floor.Rather sadly, the ownership of the Plaza Firehouse site came into dispute and the court decided in favour of the litigants Mrs L M Bigelow and Griffin Johnston. The lease with them expired in 1897 and the decision was taken that all future fire stations would be built only on state-owned land.Over the next six decades the Plaza Firehouse was variously used as a saloon, cigar store, cheap boarding house, poolroom and allegedly even as a house of ill repute! The state purchased the building in 1954 as a part of creating the El Pueblo de Los Angeles Historic Monument.The structure was restored, firefighting equipment and memorabilia was put in place and Plaza Firehouse was dedicated as California Historic Landmark No. 730. Today, even for casual uninformed visitors, the firehouse makes for a fascinating journey through the evolution of firefighting.The Plaza Firehouse is open Tuesday through Sunday 10am to 3pm.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TMenon
50,"Not Large, but Worth the Price","The Museum is not large, but there is an little information brochure that is loaded with the history of Los Angeles fire fighting. This was the first fire station in Los Angeles built by the city. There is a fire fighting wagon and behind it, stalls for the horses. The horses would walk forward and practically automatically into the harness. There is a box that was once connected to fire call boxes all over town. In an emergency, a person would activate the call box and its location would be noted in this box. There is a fireman pole, but no longer a hole in the ceiling to slide through.While the museum is small, it is part of El Pueblo de Los Angeles Historic Park, which has almost a dozen small museums and tours, events, food, and shopping. I have spent a full day at the park and needed to come back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KennethL828
50,"LA's first (1884) fire station, well worth a visit.",Just a short walk from Union Station the Plaza Firehouse Museum is well worth a visit. the guy there the day we went was full of great info and really helpful. The displays are fantastic and the old pole the firemen came down is still there. This is a free museum so make sure you give a donation so that future generations will be able to marvel at this significant piece of Los Angeles history.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luk12017
40,"Small museum, but worth the visit. Make it part of an excursion!","The Plaza Firehouse museum is a small, yet free museum. I'd probably rate it a 3 due to how small it is, but I've recently committed to not give any free museum less than a 4 (unless there was something wrong). The man who worked there was very nice and informative. If you want the full experience, come on a Thursday when they have two workers and one of them brings you upstairs! We missed that part, but I bet it's super cool.There are definitely cool things here, just not a ton. While I wouldn't make a day trip to the area just for this museum, this area is CERTAINLY worth a day trip! My toddler and I literally visited 6 museums! There are small museums all around here and almost all of them are free! Start your journey with a walk down Olvera Street! Catch the Avila Adobe, maybe have lunch or a snack. Then walk across the way and visit The Chinese American Museum, the Plaza Firehouse Museum and the new Gateway to Nature (which is a nature center full of things for kids to do). Then walk across the street to La Plaza De Culturas y Artes museum. Maybe poke your head into Our Lady of Angeles Church. I'm very Atheist, but this is historic as it's literally what named and started Los Angeles. Then continue down Main street and hit up the American Tropical Historical Museum and end with the Italian American Museum! There are a few other things in there too I think I missed. A great day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bostonsavatage
50,City's First Firehouse,"This Historic Landmark is situated in the center of the Old Plaza area of El Pueblo de Los Angeles. Located across from Union Station and just a few steps from Olvera Street, this well-restored Firehouse Museum is a worthwhile place to visit. An original horse-drawn fire engine dominates this small museum. On the walls are displays of Firemen's helmets of by-gone eras, firefighting memorabilia, and historical photographs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/socaltravelers2016
50,Interesting insights into LA history,Great little museum located in the Plaza Firehouse which was the first building in the city designed to house fire fighting crews and their equipment. Museum guide Josh is very knowledgeable about the history of the city - well worth visiting.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RamblingProf
40,A Little Firehouse History,"This is the first firehouse built by the City of Los Angeles. The road to establishing a city fire department and firehouse took several decades until the first city-built firehouse in 1884. The building had a complex history until it ceased to be a fire house in 1897. After, it had various uses, some not too glamorous, until 1953 when the Historic Park was established and the old fire house became a museum.The building is two-story with firemen living upstairs who would slide down the pole, like you've seen in cartoons, only the pole is real and still there. The horses were stabled toward the rear of the building. In the event of a fire, a board wired to fire callboxes all over town, would indicated which callbox was activated. The houses would be brought forward to harness suspended from the ceiling and hitched to the wagon. At the end of the fire, the horses would pull the wagon back into the building and return to their stalls while the wagon was stopped on a turn table that would turn half way around to face outward again.I've visited the museum several times. The museum in at the south corner of the plaza.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KennethL828
40,Another unexpectant find,"While I went to Olvera for its Mexican heritage, I never expect to learn about historic fire fighting but that is exactly what this free museum is. It is complete with an old fire pole and a horse drawn fire engine. It chronicles the early history of firefighting in LA and Southern California. When you realize how dry it is here you also realize the importance of firefighting to early LA. Again not why you probably came here but once here take the time to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GroverR
30,Interesting insight into Fire Fighting history,"This is the oldest fire station in Los Angeles, and is now a small FREE museum (donations welcome).

A great place to get a sense of history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Merrowmum
40,A Must for Fire Buffs,"The 1884 Plaza Firehouse,the oldest firehouse in Los Angeles, is wonderful fun for anyone who appreciates 19th Century tools and equipment for firefighting. Opened as a museum in 1960, it is a California Historic Landmark. Children will be intrigued by learning that early fire engines were pulled by horses. The memorabilia items are limited, but still fascinating.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chestnuthouse
30,Informative,"The Admission: FREE!! But they do take donations.The Museum: It is a very small museum but informative. One of the museums near Olvera Street.

40,We enjoyed it,This is a very neat little place to visit. They have the old fire engines and all sorts of things to check out on the walls. My mom is a current fire department employee so it was really cool for us to check out all the pictures and information as well! It's a relatively small place so plan on being there only about an hour at the most.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaySwift
40,Authentic old firehouse,We didn't get a chance to go inside but from the outside it looked very nice. Would have liked more time to see it properly but this area is very dense with things to see,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Openfj0re
