50,Great morning of fun,"Another of Hollywood's ""Must see"" attractions. There are a few wax museums along the blvd but I think this one was out favourite.Set over a number of floors with differant exhibits for decades, films and genres it proves great fun posing with this near realistic figures for selfies.Buy your ticket before hand and save a fortune on the door fee and don't forget to take a printed ticket. We saw a number of guests struggling to get up emails and scan barcodes from phones etc.The photographs taken by the team here although a little pricy are great and a souviner worth having.There is no rush to get around and you are not pressured to move on as you are in one of the other wax mueums in Hollywood. As you get to the end of your tour dont forget to jump in the ballpit overlooking the main road and get some pictures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DonotDreamJustTravel
30,Fun way to spend an hour,A standard Madame Tussauds expereince. A good mix of statues and a fun way to spend an hour. We went at 4.00pm (ticket was for any time in the day) and it was very quiet.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/queenr0ck
40,Great Fun!,"Sir in the Grease movie car with Travolta, Box with Rocky , sit in the bicycle with ET. You can make this Madame Tussauds fun with props provided.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DDR1234
50,Quick holiday getaway,"Now I’m on the west coast. It’s amazing how quick I can go to Hollywood. I’ve tried to go to all of Madame Tussaud’s and it’s cool how different they are. I’ve done Orlando, Washington, New York, Singapore, and Las Vegas. If you’re there right before it closes with not many visitors it could like being in a haunted house. Who ever does the figures does a great job. The eyes look so real.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gurltravelon
50,Better than the other wax museum,The wax figures here are much more realistic than the other museum. Reasonable price with the voucher from the vendor on the streets outside. Not too busy either,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/agt96
40,"Do it once, count on it being busy and have fun","I think this is a must visit once kind of thing. You’ve been to one wax museum, you’ve seen them all. This is one of the nicer ones here, some are errrrrr horrifying. It’s busy, don’t expect to have that one wax figure all to yourself for photos, expect to wait a bit for others to get through. Not made in mind with those who aren’t able bodied for photo ops, but you can get some cool photos and enjoy all the same. Just not as well designed for such.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/intentionalgoddess
20,Average but worth the trip.,We went when it first opened in the morning but was not too busy. I thought there would be a lot more figures and rooms but maybe I thought about it too much. The Marvel room was very cool.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/laurynreid94
50,This place was a lot of fun,"My daughter and I had planned to just walk up and down Hollywood Boulevard, with no intentions of visiting Madame Tussauds. I'm so glad we decided to go in. First of all the cashier pulled out a 50% off coupon so that was a huge score! She was very informational on where to go and after going through the turnstile, another lady had told us where to go and where we could find different celebrities.Growing up, my mom used to take me to the Wax Museum down the street. This place BLOWS that away. Not sure what these figures are made of but their reactions, expressions and everything about them is so realistic. A couple of them we had to poke just to make sure it wasn't a real person.We took tons of pictures and had fun with some of the props. I definitely recommend checking this place out. I've heard a lot of good things about the San Francisco location, but glad we could make it to the Hollywood set. Great for all ages. You'll see old-time movie stars, newer stars, singers, sports people. It's a lot of fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BakerBilly
40,Brilliant exhibition with great photo opportunities with the 'stars'! Highly recommended.,"A thoroughly enjoyable visit. Slight hiccup with our booking as bar code did not appear on our phone but, a supervisor resolved the problem. We throughly enjoyed our tour of all the exhibits and the many photo opportunities with the 'stars'. A throroughly enjoyable morning. A 'must see' attraction. Highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaellK524GY

50,So. Much. Fun,"There was so much fun stuff, great photo opportunities and chances to step into the celebrities' world. There were no long lines, the tickets are not overly costly, and you can get around at your own pace as the place is not packed with people. We enjoyed it and would recommend it as an activity for friends and family",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peseva
50,Fun day,We really enjoyed ourselves in madame Tussauds Hollywood.It's worth paying a visit if u r in Hollywood.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/felicia1963
30,Tussauds Hollywood,"If you have the time and have not been to a wax works before, it is great. The cost for an Australian traveller is a bit steep due to exchange. But you are considering booking a day tour, a lot of the companies offer free passes. Worth looking into.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/skye773
50,Evening visit,Brilliantly done models so lifelike. Great for adults & older children very interactive with props to make great photographs. You can get really close up to statues which is great. Well worth a visit,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fluge1
50,Amazing experience,I have been to the MT in London and I loved this one even better. I would recommend getting there when it first opens 10am. That way you can do multiple pictures before it gets too crowded. The figures were so life like. Loved it,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/code33hittman
40,Great novelty,"It was good to see but a couple of negitives. If you've prepurchased online your tickets, the process to email them and get them printed at the entry is ridiculous. It took longer to get in that if we just waited in que. The other down side was it was over crowded. Could barely see and take photos without pumping into people or wait ages to see the next one.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarahmR8114TO
40,Fun with the waxworks,"Wax museums are always a fun time and Madame Tussauds never disappoints! The only problems we encountered were rude customers making hateful comments and just being not nice people. The line to make was hands was incredibly long and slow, but we understood that it was a process and couldn't be rushed! Overall such a fun time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sherrif80
30,"Fun, but...","The staff are not helpful when purchasing tickets and it’s unclear even where to at first. Skip the Jimmy Kimmel video interview, it doesn’t sync. More details on wax figures, especially on the top floor, would be great too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2804gezzab
50,A great experience!,"I enjoyed this place. I took a picture with almost every wax figure in the building. Super cool. The only problem I would say I had was after booking the tickets and getting to the place, my tickets did not show up from the trip advisor app which caused my entry time to get in longer. We never did find the tickets, but the guy there saw that I purchase them and let us in. Ling story short buying my tickets through trip advisor was my only issue. In the gift shop everything was $5. I was able to buy all my family awesome souvenirs. Kids would love this place too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mstweet23
50,Definitely a must see!,"Kids loved it, seen that for the first time. The way the models are done, the precision of their lines is just perfect.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/977matejab
50,Better than expected!,"Though I visited all major cities with a Tussaud this is the first time I visited one, thanks to my son. It is a fun visit and the fact it is in Hollywood adds a special taste to it.Must do if you have time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cew00
50,Nice wax celebrity museum with reasonable price,Madame Tussauds Hollywood is a great place to spend a couple of hours on. Here you will see one one size wax celebrities which look surprisingly real. Go get some fun there!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KirklandTom
50,Have a Ball @ Madame Tussaud's,"This is such a fun activity the whole family can enjoy. First you see Lucille Ball from I Love Lucy, mixing up something sweet in the kitchen. The elevator is a blast too because you can snap a picture and imagine yourself on the cover of VOGUE magazine. If you're a thriller fan you'll enjoy the Illusions of Horror section with Hannibal Lecter, Alfred Hitchcock and Dracula. Throughout the museum there are props to help you experience the scenes a little more. Try on a red hoodie and pretend you're getting E.T. back home! After visiting music and movie faves like MJ, Elton, Lady Gaga, Whoopie, Britney, and The King of Rock you can really feel like a kid again and jump into the ball pit. After all, Life's a Ball.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rawandhonest
50,"Wax museum was real cool, took lots of photos","We really enjoyed our visit at Madame Tussauds Hollywood museum. Many of the figures were so cool and we took tons of pictures. If I had to pic a favorite, it had to be the Marlon Brando as The Godfather. I put on a hat just like his to take the picture with him. Love that picture! My wife had pictures taken at the ET display. That was her favorite. Some of our other favorites were Selena Gomez, Rocky Balboa, Edward Scizzorhands, John Travolta from Grease, Tom Cruise, Simon Cowell, Michael Jackson, Snoop Dogg, Lucille Ball, Elvis Presley, and the IT movie balloons. If you like Hollywood, then this is a must do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HOCKPOOH
50,Great experience and so much fun!,"Amazing experience of 3 floors of stars of all times! Kids loved it: irbid not overwhelming for kids, no lines, great light for pictures and remarkable work of the doll creators!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annahanna8
40,Fun,Had a great time making silly photos at the museum. It is was a good break from Universal before we headed to the beach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TXKellsBells
40,Always fun for photos,We brought our son to check out the wax figures. He enjoyed it. It is 3 levels and there is lots of opportunities for fun photos. It can get crowded at times but theres lots of places to sit and hang out for a bit. Nice views of the street as well. It was nice to see they change it around too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrittanyWaters711
40,Family fun,"We got free tickets with hop on hop off bus. It was fun although a lot were very olden days & we didn't know them, especially our teenagers.Enjoyed the 4D movie which I got a free ticket for from spinning the wheel outside.Enjoyed but not sure I'd want to pay full price for it!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sherbsfamily
50,Make silly faces and stupid poses,"Make yourself fool and along with all the available props, pose as silly as you can and feel as part of your dream movie.Use your imagination and let the ""actor"" come out of your body.Is the perfect place to take tons of pictures the way you have never taken before.At the end there is a shop to make your own wax hand. My only complain is that there was not a hard box to put it in case you want to put it in a suitcase.(was it helpful? give your vote)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vasileiosb373
40,Pleasantly Surprised,We only visited because we got a free visit with our bus tour. Never really keen on these museums but we were pleasantly surprised. It was laid out really well and was really relevant to Hollywood. I'm still not sure I'd pay but it's worth a visit if you get a free ticket.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CharlieJ70
40,Some new characters...,I had been to MT NYC having never been to Madame Tussaud’s before. I’ve lived in London for 12 years and visited London many times as a tourist as a child from the North East of England but had never been.At least you can rely on MT Hollywood to have James Dean and Justin Timberlake under the same roof. The wax is no replacement. But apart from having been to a JT concert that’s probably the closest I will get.I agree with many of the other reviewers who have stated that if the entry had not been included on the GO LA Pass; they probably would not have gone along. But a fun hour of entertainment nonetheless.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jassimalkanani
50,"Panoply of the greatest, past and present","Uncannily realistic is how the greatest artists of the silver screen are shown here. Stars from the past plus many more from the present.From the likes of Meryl, Clint, Marlon and the celebrated Paul Newman. Onwards to Julia Roberts, Jennifer Lawrence and Angelina.All wonderful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/permia
40,Enjoyable,"Most of the wax figurines were very realistic, however a few fell short. I would also suggest that some, although only a small portion, were American or old-time famous and were quite unknown to myself, being reasonably young and from Australia. Quite a few of the wax models came with costumes or accessories that could be used to improve all photos with the models. Overall quite enjoyable, although I was expecting a few more models.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kaitiea2019
40,"Fun, but annoying entrance","I was excited to get another place of the wax museum. Upon arriving to the entrance a bunch of wannabe cosplayers was at the entrance asking for pictures, but of course the catch is that you have to tip them to get a picture with them. THATS NOT A COSPLAYER AND THATS IS NOT WHAT WE DO. I tipped the guy $1 and he got annoyed. Ungrateful? Pretty much. Stay away from those guys.After the annoyance and costume hustlers, we were able to spend the wheel and get a discount off the tickets which was great. The wax figures looked great except for Rihanna’s and Britney’s they looked a bit off. They had a scare room that had my phobia (cockroaches) in it and I was scared to death. It was fun and got great pictures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Traveling_diamond
50,So much fun for our family!,"We came down to LA for a day at Universal Studios, and were looking for something to do Sunday night when we got into town, and thought this would be perfect. The wax figures were incredible, and some were so incredibly life-like that it was unsettling. The details in their faces, and the impeccable styling were so incredible. My 8 year old daughter (who became a diva and didn't want to go when we first brought this up as an option) absolutely LOVED it here, and mimicked every single pose the figures did and insisted I take a picture of her with all of them. In each section there's at least one figure that has props and costuming you can put on for photo ops, which was great. The very last room was a special temporary display of superheroes which was awesome. Near the end, we also spoke to a staff member at length who was very friendly and knowledgeable, and answered all of my questions. I mentioned how much I loved Elizabeth Taylor and was hoping they would have had a figure of her and he mentioned how they did but several months ago a homeless man broke into Madam Tussauds and damaged her so badly that she was still in repair. Other than that, the experience was amazing, and I would definitely want to go back again at some point.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/avehonduras
40,Really Fun,We had the LA Pass or probably would not have done this. But it is definitely worth an hour of time. Really interactive. Would recommend for families or really anyone.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sky9696
50,A Walk at Madame Tussauds,It was a wonderful experience of watching wax figures of famous personalities. The wax figures out there looked real. Unfortunately I wasn't able to click any pictures as my phone died in the middle of the trip.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SilviaColaco
30,Wax as expected but price,Thought it was a 4 stop tour. But three of the activies are free. So just pay for the wax museum. Parking was not validated. Fun area to spend a few hours,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DocMom98
50,Exciting,Exciting to see all your stars i took like 200 pictures omg i spent a little over 2 hours in there so much fun and exciting to see it they look so real just like real stars,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pau_pau_salazar
50,Worth a visit,"Really good waxworks. Lots of props that you can use to interact with which makes a change from everything being set up behind ropes. Spent a few hours in here, really enjoyed it and got some great photos.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Loveholsinthesun
40,Worth seeing and buy your ticket online,Visited Hollywood to see the sights and before we went decided to check out what to see on the Boulevard. We picked Madame Tussauds which is in right by the Chinese Theater. Its worth seeing but definitely buy your tickets beforehand online and you will save 50%. Enjoy the experience as we did!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jimb2000
40,Most Were Great Likeness,"We enjoyed this museum and seeing stars’ likeness. Some were amazing and so life-like - Betty White, Dorothy (Judy Garland), Elton John, John Wayne, etc. Others were great depictions and could see their actual size. Most (esp the women) are not only very thin but it’s amazing how some are so much shorter than they appear on screen. It was a fun experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CJHami
40,What a fun afternoon!,"We recently visited Madame Tussauds Hollywood. the display was over 3 floors with different themed sections with wax figurines in each section. Favourites included Madonna, Michael Jackson, Britney, Megan & Prince Harry and the Marvel Suoer hero’s section. They even included costumes so you could dress up like the scenes with the stars! Keep a look out for vendors with 50% off discounts too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jok125_1976
40,Life Like,Madame Tussauds is incredible the figures are so life like.I was in one section and turned around as I could have sworn someone was standing behind me.when it was the model of Steven Spielberg gave me the shivers actually. really good would recommend.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/91debdeb
50,The Most Fun Of Our Trip,We took a family trip to Hollywood and did several tours/parks but this was what we actually enjoyed the most. Our 6 year old son even had so much fun that he was sad at the end and wanted to go to 'another one'. It was the unexpected surprise of our vacation and would totally go again with friends or family that haven't seen it yet.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tylerjamesellison
50,The 90s room is great,"We purchased our ticket online which gave us a year from the date of purchase as we did not know which day on our trip we would go here, this was a great choice as its so much cheaper than the on the door price.The actual experiance was really good. We have never done a wax works before but decided it was the best way to get closer to the stars on Hollywood. My family relly enjoyed it. The kids found it really exciting and the exhibits had a lot of touch and feel activities which realy brought it to life.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iwanderaroundtown
40,"Nice, but not too clean...","The museum was very nice. However, the props looked and smelled like they haven’t been cleaned in months. At the ET exhibit, the photographer (paparazzi) didn’t want to take our picture on our device. Even though we took one with the museums camera. All of the others did so without hesitation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spoken04
50,Purchase your ticket online - it's cheaper!,"Staying in nearby Loews Hollywood for a couple of nights, we were looking for some entertainment for all the family.I'd noticed that you could purchase tickets online a lot cheaper than at the door AND you didn't need to print them out (they could be scanned from your mobile phone). We purchased in advance the $19.99 (adult) tickets that would allow us access anytime. As it happened, we weren't free until about 7pm on our last night but found this the perfect time to visit. Tickets after 8pm are sold for the cheaper price of $16.99 and I think by going at 7pm, the daytime crowds had gone but the buyers of the cheaper tickets had yet to arrive - it meant Tussauds was relatively quiet.Once everyone got over their inhibitions, we had a great time posing for some photos with the waxwork stars.A good evening's entertainment!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Grays_on_Holiday
50,An amazing talent.,"Most have been to a Madame Tussaud’s somewhere in the world, if you haven’t then you have heard about it and get the concept. Having this in Hollywood is ideal, because where else would you expect to see the stars! The layout is easy to follow and it never felt too crowded. I love that some of the figures as interactive as in you can get involved, put on an outfit or get in the scene. I also loved that when I was there they had a horror inspired section including Frankenstein and IT. Loved the had Edward scissor hands there too, I grew up on that movie and now my sister loves it. Also the 90s section was the best! As a 90s kid I didn’t want to leave, my understanding is this wasn’t permanent? They change some characters around which is great if you go more than once over a few years. I have been to this one twice in a 3 year period.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mo71ey
40,Great place to go!,"We had a two for one voucher so decided to go on our last day in LA for something to do. Great experience and awesome place to visit. Especially loved the 90's section, that was cool. Went during the week so not busy at all. Would definitely recommend as you can make your own fun and take as many pictures as you want.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tonicb_28
40,Imagination,Absolutely enjoyed every minute of this tour! Some look so real it’s scary! I have never laughed so hard in my life while using the props provided for some exhibits.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/125tatiaw
50,Fun at Madam Tussaud's,"What a great and fun place to visit. Started the visit with a 50% discount, won at the wheel right in front of the entrance. Enjoyed to see the celebrities (all in wax) patiently putting up with all the fun visitors had with them....Go with the right person(s) and you will entertain yourself for a few hours easily.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/346alexanderr
40,Good fun,Great experience the only thing I was disappointed about was Rihanna looked nothing like Robyn and Jlo looked nothing like JLo!! Kylie and Morgan Freeman was spot on 😂,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Stephanierw91
40,Great!,"Good to see icons we don't have in the UK ones. Very small though. Spin the wheel at front entrance was fun as won 1xfree entry+halfprice voucher for giftshop..Shame no Hulk, Keanu Reeves, Robert De Niro waxworks. Go early mid-week as quietest time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Metoyoutometoyou
20,No idea why I thought this is interesting,"I mean, it must be for some people...For for my and my boyfriend, I think it took us 30 minutes to visit everything.Yes, the ""celebrities"" are well drown and carved into wax. But... we really could not understand where's the fun in making some pictures with some wax statues....Not for us I believe :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dekadenza
50,Super Interesting,"Loved it! It was the first time that I visited Madame Tussauds, I opted for buying the ticket by the internet that was cheaper, and arrived at 10am when they opened, so no lines! They put some hats and stuffs that you can use to take your pictures and to make it more fun.Also the staff was very polite.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/raysantesso
50,Great!,"From the time we got there we were impressed by everything. The staff, the cleanliness and everything in between. Definitely one of the highlights from our trip to Hollywood",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DonnaR957
40,Madame Tussauds are good everywhere,"We've been to London and New Yorks so we thought we'd do this one to, is was a really hot day so was nice to get out of the sun for a few hours.Madame Tussauds are pretty much the same everywhere but I think they are still good, the figures are always world class and this particular one has some really great old movie stars and is one of the best that is set up so that you can have your picture taken with them.I guess our favourite figure has to be Captain America, only because we have a 3 year old Grandson that now thinks we have actually met his hero, we're from the UK so he's amazed we've been all the way to America and met him.There's a lovely display here, probably one of the best we've been to.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheNatster75
40,Good experience however global actors are missing,"Good experience. However, only Hollywood actors are featured. Bollywood is a big industry too. One floor can be added for other country actors like India, Korea, Japan, etc. Like MT London.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/212madhubantid
20,Not worth the money,The displays were poor compared to London. We had free entry with the hop on hop off bus and would have been very disappointed if we’d paid $30 each to get in! Just figures dotted around to take selfies with,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GO50
50,Must see,Great selectionAmazing workmanship they look so realDefinitely add to your touring plans.Bought tickets through trip advisor great deal,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H9481BQmariag
40,fun with wax,"Madame Tussauds around the world is always fun to visit. This one has many of the standard figures that all of them do, but an area where it's only specific to Hollywood. You can touch and pose with the figures and take as many photos as you wish. Always a fun time. Full price can be expensive, but on Hollywood blvd you'll see employees give out coupons for discounts. Worth the visit for a few hours of fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelhound711
40,Make time for Madame Tussauds,"Well worth a visit. Much easier to navigate than London, mainly as quite low crowds on day we visited. My daughter disappointed Leo Dicaprio not on display but enjoyed her time nonetheless.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nick_k_uk
40,closest you may get to meeting your favorite celebrity,excellent. all kinds of photo ops. just wish they would make their photos available online for purchase.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danidua
50,Super fun! Bring a selfie stick!,"I had so much fun all by myself, I almost went back the next day! I was annoyed I couldn't get my selfie stick to work at the time or I could've gotten better pics, since I went solo. I still had an excellent time and highly recommend. Buy your ticket online before you go so you can save about $10. Pull it up on your phone when you get there with the order/confirmation number email.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashleebryn
40,Madame Tussaud’s Hollywood,"Went here to fill in time in between a Hollywood walking tour and cinema at TCL. We had a spare hour and entrance was included in our L.A. Go card. As a family we didn’t have high expectations but thought we’d give it a go. We had a great time with this being one of the stand out experiences with us all being silly taking selfies with the ‘celebs’, although did struggle to move my wife on from Zac Efron. Attended at about 5pm on a Sunday and it was fairly quiet which probably made it more enjoyable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GBItineraries
40,🎥🎥🌟,"I liked the place but I just thought it was the same as the one in London. So , it’s enough that you just go to one branch",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EmiratiVacationer
40,Madame Tussauds Was Museum,"I wasn't too thrilled about visiting the museum, but I went in with my daughter and was pleasantly surprised at how much fun we had. The figures are very realistic and cover a lot of Hollywood's time periods. I took a lot of photos / selfies too and in some of them I look like I'm hanging out with the Stars (hahaha.)If you go, make sure you find some type of discount to the entrance fee. They are offered all over the place. We spun a wheel at the entrance to the museum. I received $10 off and my daughter received 50% off. You can also get a discount if you sign up for a Hollywood tour that offers them. People are also passing out coupons as you walk down the boulevard. Have fun!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A8275OFdanielm
50,Nice!,I visit Madame Tussauds with my kids and it was nice. Kids are having a lot of fun to make pictures with famous people. Its a great place for the whole family.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Marko_SI1980
40,Almost picture perfect,"Our visit to Madame Tussauds was exactly as we expected. We were able to locate buy one, get one ticket vouchers on line and had a great time taking pictures with our favorite celebrities and reading interesting information about each of them. However, the photographs taken by the Madame Tussauds staff were the greatest disappointment of our visit. When we arrived at the section to review your pictures, there was no one behind the counter to scan the bar-code so we could review our pictures, there was only a person staffing the wax hand booth across the room. After waiting a few minutes, we decided to look at another exhibit in the room. When we turned around, there was now a person at the picture counter and two families in line in front of us, who were taking an inordinately long time to review and select their pictures. After waiting for both families to review their pictures repeatedly and finally make their selections, the guy from the wax hand booth decided to come over and help us. All for naught, the pictures that were taken by the professional staff were out of focus and unusable. Obviously this left quite the negative impression of the entire experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ECJoe
50,Fun photo ops beside wax statues of many Hollywood stars,Lots of fairly realistic looking prompts which you can get up close to for photo taking. Staff are very friendly. Lots of kids during our visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KodoDrummer
50,Much more fun than I expected,These wax figures are really works of art. Though typically not my type of tourist attraction I really enjoyed this activity. They work hard to provide interactivity in the experience so you can have lots of fun photo opportunities!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BethMorrison6
40,A lot of photo fun to be had,The best part of this attraction was the amount of hilarious photos you are able to take with the figures. It is what you make of it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stewari1
50,My Birthday was Fab here!,We took over Mde Tussauds for the evening inviting 60 friends for dinner and dancing and to walk amongst the celebrities and take photos...outside on large billboard my husband sjurprised me with my picture and the words: Welcome to my party! It's fun to walk around remembering certain stars from days gone by to the greats of today and taking pics with them is really fun...staff is great...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/84trudig
50,I'm Famous!!!!!!!!!!!!,This was a fun experience - every visitor should do this!! You can have so much fun with the props and interacting with the life-like figures of your favorite stars! Enjoy it - we sure did!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/235nickit
30,Ok,"Ok but not as great as we thought. It is right at the walk of fame, you have to line up for a long queue to wait for access,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cnsusan
40,My two cents on Madame Tussauds,"Madame Tussauds - HollywoodWe took LA Go Card which included the pass for Madame Tussauds. We opted for the night tour for which you have to be present at the gate by maximum 5pm. I preferred the night tour because i wanted less crowd - didnt regret my decision one bit! ☺️ It was not super crowded and we got our own time to explore and enjoy! 💪🏻Our experience was good - I loved how each wax statue was made with so much detailing! They have props with many wax statues too, which means you can equally look good in your pictures with all the celebs! ;)When you enter, the staff takes a professional picture of you, which you can get printed at the end of your tour - we skipped that because we felt that they werent worth the price.They also have an area where you can get your hand wax statues made - i think its super cute and memorable for couples - something interesting to take back home!All in all, it was a 8.5/10 for me! ⭐️",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sanaahyd
50,Brilliant,"We couldn’t believe we didn’t have to queue, having been to the one in London which feels like you have queued for days.We walked straight in after paying and spent a good 2 hours wandering around enjoying the figures and generally being silly. We went at about 4.00pm and it was perfect, not to busy but enough atmosphere.It was great posing with our favourite stars and the selection was well pitched and appropriate to 2019. A good mix of old and new. Great you can interact with the figures.Value for money in an expensive city (look out for deals and vouchers).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O3559JIhelenc
40,Fun place to take pictures..,"If you have been to Madame Tussauds in London, please be aware the this is just the ""baby brother"" of the original. Quite small, but still a fun place to spend an hour and take a lot of awesome pictures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nemi_42
30,Expected more,"I've been to a few of these museums around the world now, and I must say; being the Hollywood one - this was a bit disappointing. Not much interaction, or figures for that matter, considering the location. Exciting to learn about the prosess and handcraft, but some of the figures are really poorly made, biggest disappointment was James Dean and Chris Hemsworth. Luckily, the entrance was ""free"", this place is included in a lot of tourist passes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/beckit88
50,Excellent Museum,"Great time, a lot of wax celebrities with the correspondingstuffs to wear for amazing pictures, a 4d short film at the end for more fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cesarg797
50,We had a blast!!,"This is a must stop if you are in the area. There is a parking ramp just around the corner that has valet. It’s $20, but worth it to save yourself a headache with trying to find other parking. They take your picture in the beginning. Each celebrity really looked so real. I almost felt awkward getting so close to them to take a selfie. But after we got used to it, we had so much fun! You can also make a wax hand when you are there. There are even spots where there are props to use when you pose for pictures. We recommend going for sure!! Have fun!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R5453RXmichelles
50,Fun Exciting,We were just looking for something budget friendly and fun to do and Madame Tussands was just that. The wax figures were so life like and to top it off the visit ended with a 4D Marvel experience,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lorealb2016
40,Good not Great,"Not sure this is a must see, but it is air conditioned and the figures are sooo lifelike I expected any one of them to move and scare me to death. The 4D movie at the end was pretty cool too, even bringing this old guy to laughter.....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/660rickd
50,Awesome as always,"I would definitely visit again. My kids, ages 19, 17 and 9, and I had an awesome time.The facility was clean. Wax figures were amazing.I purchased tickets online and save a few dollars which always makes things better.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cccook1979
40,Movie Stars Bonanza,"After been to Madame Tussauds in Sydney and London, I was not very keen to visit this one but it came free with 2 days sightseeing bus tour. I am glad I visited this place, so many famous statues and unlike some places, here you have a chance to stand and pose hand in hand with celebrity statues. Loved the place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NQ8286
40,First time to visit madame tussauds,"Although this was my first time to visit madame tussauds, the experience was great. Got to meet lots of Hollywood actors. The details of the Statue was excellent. Very recommended place to visit when you are in the Hollywood area. Don’t forget to take picture with Hollywood walk of Fame.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wirawan-acen
40,It was alright,Not as many statues and you expect to see hence the reason for my 4 stars. It is somewhat interactive but way better experience if you go when is not too crowded.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AngelO235
50,Hadmy birthday party there!,My husband surprised me by hiring out Mde Tussauds for my birthday! we had 60+ friends for dinner dancing and just meandering around the lifelike statues taking pics...lots of fun and staff were great! I was even on the billboard out front!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/84trudig
10,"Do NOT PURCHASE DIGITAL PICTURES! THE CODES DON""T WORK!!!","We were there in Hollywood on Wednesday, June 5th and took pictures then bought the digital package and were told the pictures would be available in two days. A week later and multiple emails later, we still don't have the pictures. Save yourself $34 and DO NOT purchase the digital option. IT IS A SCAM!! YOU WILL NEVER RECEIVE YOUR PICTURES!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Meander610184
50,Not just wax behind glass,"The best thing about MT Hollywood is how interactive the museum is and how . You can reenact the ""Psycho"" shower scene with Hitchcock, help Tarantino direct Uma Thurman in ""Kill Bill,"" and sit in a director's chair with Spielberg.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CareyMartin
50,More fun than expected,It’s the next best thing to seeing real celebrities! What a fun few hours! My three children (teens and tweens) all found something to enjoy. My wife and I marveled at the realistic wax figures around us and hot up close and personal with so many “stars!”,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/larrywM7141QK
50,So much fun!,We visited with two of our adult children and had a blast taking photos with celebrities old and new. How much fun? Loads!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pwb58
50,Great Photo ops!,Find a coupon from someone out on Hollywood Blvd and have fun with great photo ops! My sister and I laughed and laughed at the pictures of took with all of the celebs! We definitely got a good laugh when we got to the I love the 90s bedroom. It looked exactly like our bedrooms and we were going to the NKOTB Mixtape Tour that night!! We both made wax hands since we had a BOGO coupon with our ticket. What a unique keepsake!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JamieM459
40,Look So Real,"I had done the one in Orlando, so we chose this one over the Hollywood Wax Museum. We got 1/2 price coupons from someone on the Hollywood Star Walk, so it was worth it. They look so real, and it is good to take photos.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ryanbeckyj
50,Brilliant,One of the best trips to go to in Hollywood. 100% would recommend. Staff were helpful and friendly. Wax works were brilliant!!! 5*,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gexway
40,Delightful Surprise,"I didn’t want to go to Madame Tussaud’s because I thought it would be cheesy. But our travel mates wanted to go so I forked over $20 and pasted a smile on. I was pleasantly surprised. First off, the figures are incredibly lifelike and their sculptors are true artists. The real trick to enjoying the experience is to go with the flow. You can actually touch the figures so take pictures with your favorite celebrities or movie characters. It really turned out fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HJHM
40,Excellent display of the stars,"I was very skeptical whether to go or no but ended up being there on the insistence of my colleague who was with me. It did not turn out to be all that bad, it was not as spacious and large as I expected but still had good fun. I wouldn't say its a must visit in Hollywood but definitely worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thiru_sri3
50,Can Walk Right Up to Wax Figures,"This place is really cool in that you can walk right up to the wax figures and compare heights and get an idea of how big they are. Some of the actors are huge, such as John Wayne. Others are of more average height, such as Bogart. Valet parking is most convenient and is right in the building.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LiketoeatCincinnati
50,Had such a Laugh!,We had the attraction on our Go LA card. It was so much fun! The wax figures are so impressive! It felt strange sitting or standing next to them because they looked so real! The fact that you can touch the figures I found surprising but was really good! They had many famous celebrities and a lot of interactive parts where you could put on costumes to pose for photos. We were lucky as it wasn’t too busy when we were there. I also thought it was great that you could go back to a waxwork if you didn’t have time to take your photo with it or it was too busy. I would definitely return!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EmsSher
50,Much more fun than I thought it would be!,We went on a Sunday late morning and it was a perfect time to go. Not crowded at all so we took lots of pictures with the wax models (some of them look so life like it's scary!) without waiting in line or having people wait for us. There is also a ball pit in the front window that we had fun playing in (adult and 2 teenagers). I thought the whole place would be really cheesy and stupid but we had some extra time so decided to go. It was totally worth it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/juliebQ2317DH
40,Fun morning,"We visited Madame Tussauds yesterday morning and enjoyed walking round all the waxworks. It wouldn’t normally be something we’d choose, but if you don’t mind a tourist hot-spot, then it’s quite fun to wander round.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnySober
50,So much fun!!,My husband and I had a blast taking tons of pics with celebs who look incredibly real. A must see! We bought a Go City card and did lots of attractions.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barbiedoll06
40,Worth the money,"I didn’t think it would be as good as it was, they are pretty life like and kind of spooky. I would always have to double take when I walked into another room. I would recommend the museum as a must see in LA in Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shubsens
50,Tourist traps are fun,Madame Tussauds was museum is so much fun. Seen on your favorite celebrities in such a different environment is A-blast. So many selfies with so many celebrities. Some of them are really well done while others you kind to question the face. But it's definitely a fun location to go with a group and laugh and just enjoyin afternoon.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/socalguy7979
40,Comparison,"My boyfriend and I did this museum after we purchased and walked through Ripley’s, Guiness and Hollywood Wax Museum. We wanted to compare the wax models between Hollywood Wax Museum and Madame Tussuads. I have also gone to Madame Tussauds in Las Vegas. No pictures as their on my boyfriends phone 🤦‍♀️",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WhereIsAshley
10,Overpriced,The wax is impressive and the staff are nice. But it's sooo lazy. Itz literally just statues in a room... nothing else. Compared to the London version... where you take a taxi around and the camber of horrors. Avoid.. it's just a way to take money from tourists,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shanec737
30,Interesting,"This was interesting. Often the perception of a Star is very different to their actual height. It was fun to do, but definitely a one off visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/971louisep
30,Ok for a bit of fun,"We had free entry as part of a tour (I wouldn't pay the normal $20 each entry fee) It wasn't too busy so you could look and take pictures of the works. We had some time to kill so it worked well for us, but I wouldn't make a special trip here. It is located on the walk of fame in the middle of the busy tourist area where you can't move and are consistently hassled by people wanting you to take a tour or have a picture taken with someone dressed up in a cheap costume. Tussauds have some realsitic (and not so realistic) looking statues. It's clean and cool inside.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/siz_123
50,Great Waz Museum,We really enjoyed this museum. The celebrities looked so real. The kids had a lot of fun with the props as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Siciliana70
40,great photo spot!,Great for tourists who want the LA experience. Its really fun to take pictures and pretend you're meeting all these celebrities.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Storyteller708253
30,Fun,"If you’ve been to a wax museum before, you’ll know what this is all about. It’s quite expensive but a fun stop. It’s open late so that helps in getting to go there. It’s right in the heavy tourist area on Hollywood so easy to get to.They have lots of celebrity to take selfies with. What I liked about this place is that they have costumes you can put on to make the picture better; for example, a yellow rain coat for the the It set up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tshep42
40,Fun times and great photo ops,"Live in L.A. and never thought of going to our local wax museum, great decision! Had a wonderful time with the our teen girls. The girls took a lot of pictures with the celebrity figures. Very life like. Great fun for all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rosalindam846
50,Awesome!,This is a great place to take pictures to show your family and friends you’re next to the stars! 😜😉,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vivicab2019
50,Great wax museum!,"My husband and I have been to other wax museums before, but none of them measure up to our most recent trip here! The figures definitely look like the celebrities they are modeled after. They look so lifelike, it was almost eerie.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WAChipmunk
50,Go with a friend!,"Cool waxworks, go with a friend so that he/she can take photos of you with the stars! Worth the money!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kaye2014
40,Added bonus on a Go day ticket.,"This was interesting to walk around and there was plenty to see. We spent about 45 minutes there whilst waiting to go on a Beverly hills tour. We bought a Go ticket for the day and managed to do Warner brothers, Beverly hills Skyspace and Madame Tussauds. Had hope to do Chines theatre but couldn't get a tour. Not sure if it would have been on the list had we not got the Go ticket.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janebG2415CQ
40,Fun time!,We enjoyed this a lot! This was the first time going to one of these and we enjoyed it! It would be even better if there was more!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlaskanTravelZ
20,Get a discount voucher,After visiting m/t In New York we found this one not as good we pre paid and got a discount but never worth full price,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulbN1555XH
40,Very good,Spend about two hours with my wife and son. Worth a visit. The waxworks are on three separate floors working your way from top to bottom. Loads of celebrities on display. Recommended.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X9176ZLcarld
50,Awesome fun,My husband and I visited on a whim. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and got some super pics to share. We played the virtual game and that was so fun also. Would definitely go against and thank you to Trip Advisor for the discount on tickets.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/judieb2019
50,Get a voucher,Well worth a visit and if you are clever get yourself a 50% voucher which they hand out down Hollywood Boulevard. The waxworks are based over several floors working your way from top to bottom. Loads of celebrities on display. One thing we did like was the props at various exhibits to dress up and add to your photos. My wife said she thought it was better than the one in NYC that we had also visited. Good place to visit get a coupon though.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Steve40_12
50,Madam Toussad’s Hollywood Boulevard,What a beauty to behold especially at night. Enjoyed the experience. After a long day at work it was time for some play time. A must see if you are ever in the Los Angeles area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sparkleyourworld
40,Different from rest,All Hollywood and you can take pictures with them. If you do a hop on hop off for two days you get madam tuseaus free,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/worldtraveller13341
40,this was fun,we especially loved the surprise attractions inside- an amazing virtual reality experience we could play together and a 7d polar express experience. we had a great time trying on props and taking photos with the wax models. there was also educational stuff teaching you how the models are recreated to the size and dimensions of actual celebrities. engaging visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GrnMtnGirl79
50,Good family fun!,"This museum did not disappoint. Took my teenage daughter & friend for her birthday and they had an absolute blast. Recommend purchasing the VIP package online which is the same price as the GA if you walk up, but includes a wax of your hand & souvenir pic!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jodigomez
40,fun fun fun,"enjoyed Madome Tussauds very much....lots of freedom to take alot of selfies, and pictures, very life like!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tofuman777
30,Bit of fun,Was a fun time just chilling with the wax models. Wasn’t super busy so we were able to take our time taking snaps. The addition of props helped to make photos better. Was a great way to spend some time during rain outside.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CairnsMel12
40,A great way to spend a few hours especially when it's raining,During our trip to LA we had one of those rare wet rainy days so we decided it was a great day to check out TLC Chinese Theatre (Grauman's Chinese Theatre) as it would be less crowded and while we were there we decided a visit to Madame Tussauds as well. It's a great way to spend a couple of hours and getting up close to the wax models was about as close as you'll ever get to the real thing. There's even props & costumes you can wear to look the part next to your favourite celebrity/actor/historical figure. We went in with low expectations but we had so much fun posing and taking photos next to our favourites. Well worth a visit,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C9666QRkareng
40,Creepy but Fun,This was my first time in a wax museum and I was impressed by how lifelike and accurate the depictions were. They had a huge range and number of stars on several floors. It was a good activity to kill a couple of hours in Los Angeles.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/989amyk
40,These places are just plain old fun!,"Wax museums are everywhere, in most major cities but there's a lure about them. I just love to see if the statues resemble the real actors, and love the decors they use for each one of them. Love it or not, these places are there to stay and it's the only place where you can 'meet and pose' with some of your fave artists! The object to these is taking pictures, making fun souvenirs and just enjoy every moment. Take your time, go through the museum twice and just have fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanielTripLaVie
40,lots of fun,"We had so much fun ""playing"" with all the wax figures. We got to see some of our favorite celebrities/characters/historical figures. They had a whole Marvel section with our favorite superheros, and the 4D Marvel show. At first the kids thought it would be boring, but they ended up having so much fun, and learning about some people at the same time. I love that there are props by some of the more popular figures to make taking pictures more special.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tziviar
40,Very nice!,If you have some extra time on your visit to the Los Angeles area you cannot go wrong with a visit here. Plenty of opportunities for photos and selfies.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/briandQ3255VQ
40,Very well done and lots of fun,"Had a lot of fun playing in this museum. It is cool to see the stars up close because they are so well done but more fun with the interactive stations set up. Go with your silly friends and have a great time. The museum wasn't as big as I had expected so doesn't take more than about an hour to get through. I'm not sure why, but just thought there would be more wax figures than there was. There are some discount coupons if you look around; we got one from taking a star homes tour first.I'd recommend because the figures are so well done and life-like.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Treyab73
50,Meet your idols,"Amazing to see your idols in the flesh, or in this case Wax. Certainly interesting to compare their true stature to our limited experiences of movies. More than enough life-like figures for ticket value. What I found most interesting is the encouragement of pictures, as this is opposite how museums usually are. Throw caution to the wind and bring out the ""actor"" in you as you pose and snap, a fun and creative experience. Really enjoyed our visit and highly encourage leaving with some very realistic looking photos to show off the Infamous to your Not-So-Famous friends!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BeBiggerThanAZipCode
50,"excellent venue, with lots to see","great venue with lots to see and do very hands on in some areaswell worth the money .look for guys handing out discount vouchers on the street or go onto the web site to buy cheap tickets, its well worth it",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PaulineC450
40,3 Floors of of figures,First of if you know you are going by your tickets online. It will save you about $10 a tickets. If you find yourself there buy it thru a smartphone. I saw the price and then looked online while standing in front of the place and bought my tickets with my phone. Had them scanned and saved money. It is 3 floors and the people are very life like. You can get right up next to them for pictures. Only spent about an hour here but was fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mnako
40,Lots of fun for the kids,Good way to spend a couple of hours in Hollywood. Some do look very real.Good way to entertain family visiting Los Angeles.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheFoodTraveler
30,Definitely family friendly. Most fun was watching other people taking photos with the wax figures.,"This is the 3rd Madame Toussauds I've been to, and the least interesting, other than watching other people taking photos which was so much fun. Great props for photos. I really enjoyed Alfred Hitchcock's set up, and Edward Scissorhands (Johnny Depp). Kind of crowded, but that is typical for a Sunday afternoon. Definitely take your camera.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sweitzen
40,Hollywood,"All the usual things you would expect from Madam Tussauds, they do have some one outside offering $10 off per person so wouldn't recommend booking in advance. Surprisingly the exit from the attraction was the worst part!! Once you leave the attraction you have to exit via the shop next door. The shop is a discount souvenir shop and isnt very big, the place was so busy you had to fight your way out!!! Not a great way to leave an attraction at all and very frustrating, i like to choose what shops i go into and not be forced into one!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/charlottel517
40,Great time,Had a great time visiting this wax museum. Employees were super friendly and helpful. It was hard to distinguish the wax figures from real people at times. The most fascinating fact was how short a lot of these celebrities are. An employee confirmed that they are exact measurements. We spent about 1 1/2 hrs. Definitely recommend buying admission tickets and VR tickets online for extra savings.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seo95758
50,Tussauds LA,"Madame Tussauds is an excellent family-friendly attraction, right in the heart of Hollywood. Don't forget your camera - you'll need it to photograph all of your favourite celebrities. It takes approximately two hours to thoroughly explore all that this museum has to offer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/_maka1620
10,Not worth it,"Don’t waste your money, not worth it, we expected his to be good as it was in Hollywood but it is not.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shazy2014
50,Great Fun!!!,I have been to Madame Tussards in Las Vegas previously which was good but Hollywoods was a delight!!! Our family had hours of fun here!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jamiep204
40,The opportunity to take a photo with the celebrities,"this is our second time in Madame Tussauds It was fun even though for me, some of the figures do not look like their owners but was fun. I like that they provide you the accessories so you can take pictures with them. Bring your camera",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ada92871
40,Something Different,"This was not something I ever thought that I would do, but we had a bit of time to kill and found a Groupon for it. I was pleasantly surprised! When you first walk it, it takes you a bit off guard. It is a bit freaky but then becomes quite fun. The vast majority of them look SO real.There are 3 levels that you can go between by stairs or the elevator so it is accessible to anyone unable to do stairs.As you go down through the exhibits, they become a little more interactive. They have props and outfits use to take pix with the displays.They have a few points with photographers that will take really fun, posed pictures of you with your group but be prepared to shell put money of you want to buy them. One photo printout was $22. They do have a $30 digital option that includes all of your photos too.I'd say check it out if youre looking for something touristy and goofy to do or with kids. Do look for a groupon though. I think we saved $10 on 2 tickets.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ApolloBitMe
50,Bring your camera for fun times,"I chose this museum to go to because someone was handing out coupons on the walk of fame. I was blown away and had a great time admiring and taking pictures with all of the wax figures. The quality was top notch and they even had props that you can put on for picture taking. Would go with a friend to take pics for you or invest in a good selfie stick, unless you have no shame like me and asked strangers to take pictures for you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JingleBELLz
30,Decent museum,"We’ve been to several madame tussauds, this is not the best. It’s over several floors with some decent figures. It passed a few hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1weetwood
50,Amazing and Interesting,"It’s an amazing and fun museum, that has 3 floors, one of music and movie celebrities, one of classic movies, and one of the behind the scenes and avengers. Every floor has astonishing work!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anuila04
50,Laughed a lot,This place had me and my husband laughing the whole time. For the price it was a great time. You get to walk through at your own pace and it wasn’t very crowded when we went. There are so many figures to look at. Some look so real it’s scary! Definitely worth checking out.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/serafina6
50,One of the best MT museums!,"We did this as part of our Go LA Card and were so glad we did. This was one of the most elaborate museums of MT's. Great photo op's and there were lot of props alongwith to spice up your pics. The directional signage was a little poor as few times us (& few others) got lost, but overall pretty great experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/525atulc
40,Family Friendly Attraction,"A trip to Hollywood isn’t complete without a stop at Madame Tussards Wax Museum. The wax figures were true to size. They looked lifelike. The staff was friendly and attentive. We really enjoyed the interactive movie with special effects. I was caught off guard by the water, sounds and 3D visuals. We laughed because I kicked off my shoe accidentally while reacting to the special effects. It’s a great attraction for the whole family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hazelcrest
40,Too much fun!,I actually didn't think that a visit to Madame Tussaud's wax museum would be as much fun as it was but it turned out to be a welcome surprise. Be sure to take lots of pictures when you visit here. It's a blast.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/0221Serendipity
30,Short visit,"The guide advised 2 hours for this attraction, it barely took 30 minutes. A bit disappointing to be honest.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChrisCDC
50,Must see!!,"The wax figures kind of creep you out at first and you think they are real, but when You get used to it, its amazing!! The interactive figures are cool and a change to get great pics!! Well worth it, this was my second visit. There are ways to get free tickets, if you are booking another tour elsewhere (mine was through starline for the celebrity homes tour) but still worth the price. Highly recommended!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sammi_sinister
50,So fun!,Really enjoyed going here with my family. The figures are just AMAZING and it was so much fun for everyone 😁 loved it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andreasotoc
50,A must do!!,"My kids ages 8,10,12 were not to keen on goin to see a Wax Museum on our last day of itinerary in Hollywood but they absolutely loved it there hey had so much fun posing next to he Celebrity’s and they were such amazing look a likes of he stars we were absolutely wowed and the variety of thing to do there from putting on costumes to virtual world to the 4D Show at the end to the great gift shop we all thought it was up there on our top highlights of our 2 week vacay to the States",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/11naomi
40,A good few hours out,"Stopped by here on a whimsy wasn’t expecting much. Was pleasantly surprised 😊.A little pricey, but can get concession tickets on group on if you plan. Can take as little or as much time as you want, and photo opportunities will abound. Excellent likenesses of all.Very easy to get to on the train, with the benefit of having the star walk outside.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/reneeg116
50,Lots of Fun!!!,"My daughter and I stopped at the wax museum while on vacation in LA. I wasn't expecting much, but was pleasantly surprised by their display. I assumed the wax statues would look similar to the actual stars, but some of them were so realistic I would have thought it was the real thing. We used the ""Go Los Angeles Card"" from Groupon for free entry. The building is three levels filled with wax statues of popular TV, movie, music, and Sports stars. The exhibits are actually set up so you can get up close and take photos with the statues. Check out this attraction, you won't be disappointed!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeanW_12
40,Adventures in Wax,"After a fun viewing of Coco at Disney’s El Capitan theater, we explored the Blvd and stumbled in Madame Toussauds. I took tons of photos all varying in silliness and enjoyed the time. Staffers were helpful. The photo section was very poorly understaffed and exiting was delayed by at least 15 minutes on a pretty long day. It’s a fun adventure. Pro photo tip: identify direction the statue is viewing then pose to look in the same direction. It makes for really awesome photos.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RocioM410
30,Poor variety of figures,Disappointed by Madame Tussauds in Hollywood. I think that there could be a lot more celebrity figures from Hollywood and famous people from outside of Hollywood that should be included. Not worth the entrance fee.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kaygeeIreland
50,My First Madame Tussauds Museum Visit,"It is the 9th Museum under this name. The museum has more than 100 wax figures of various celebrities in a three story building on Hollywood Boulevard in Hollywood. My kids liked the real life wax models and they took pictures with almost all models. The best part is you can rub your shoulders with the starts models. You wear matching dress, a cap or a hat, can lift a cup of tea etc. to match your star. There is a souvenir shop also. One section in museum shows the technique used to make live status.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VIPIN_GOEL_TP_Impex
30,Intersting to See...but not enough wax figures,"The wax museum is located in the heart of all the action. I do have to say that it was interesting to see some of the wax figurines and how lifelike they seem. In my opinion, some of the wax figures that they have included are outdated... Rihanna no longer has her red hair colour, and many wax figures are much older now. However the most important piece is I felt like there were some empty spaces at Madame Tussauds that could've had figurines included.I will advise of an important tip... when we were there we did not pay full price... there are vendors all over Hollywood Boulevard in front of the Chinese theatre and in front of the wax museum itself that provide discounts for up to 50% off.Ultimately although the wax figurines they do have are really well done, and it is a fun time, the factors above are why I gave it a 3",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SC1233
30,Not much there,"fro the price, i was expecting a bit more than what we got! yes its cool to see how well these are made and yes i appreciate how long it takes to make each one..... but.....there was s many gaps where things looked like they used to be. for $30 you expect to spend atleast a few hours at a place, it took us about 30 minutes at a stretch to see everything and that was staring at numerous things for ages! still a cool place to visit but.. very pricey for what it is.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mondeorock
50,Worth Every Penny You Spent,This is the place where you can bring your family with you and spend a few hours with different famous celebrities all over the world. Be there early so you can have more time enjoying the life-life wax models.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AikenJoshAndrew
40,Fun to see!,"Well, it was much smaller than I expected, but I was pretty impressed with the quality of the wax figures. It was a lot of fun though. I brought my mother, from NJ, to see the museum and she really enjoyed it. It wasn't overly crowded as I expected and we were able to take our time throughout. Again, the quality was outstanding and very impressive. Good price if you buy your tickets online.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlwaysHopeful419
50,Family U.S trip,Absolutely amazing place in an absolutely disgusting area. The wax models are so life like and very well made. The facilty itself is very easy to move around. The only flaw is having to navigate through 2-3 gift shops on the way back out.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jasonrB1253YW
50,Fun filled day and lots too see,"Always wanted to visit Madame Tussaud’s but it’s expensive in London, so took opportunity whiles being here. It’s was fun and lots of celebs to see. The themeing was good lots of different genres, one thing that shocked me was how cheap it was for one ticket only $30 that's chaps for what you get to see and get involved",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/imaddg
40,Good experience,"My first experience of Madame Tussauds museum, nothing to compare with but was worth the price.Recommend you to buy tickets online and visit after 5 PM for cheaper tickets.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eliiima
40,Fun few hours.,"Fun way to spend a few hours in Hollywood. Can't believe how some of the statues look so real. Since you can get up close to the figures, you can take funny pictures with them. That's what my family chose to do. Good entertainment at a reasonable price. MAKE SURE TO PURCHASE YOUR TICKETS IN ADVANCE or you will pay $10.00 more at the door.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/UniversityMom1
30,Nice,"Never been to a Madame Tussauds before and it was pretty cool. Some wax figures were really well made, some were crappy. 3 Flores, 30$ per adult and no line when we went around noon on a Saturday in August.A minus to the cashier that didn't mention that one could get ticket to the Hop on Hop off bus for 45$ and get the admission to madam Tussauds for free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/evilhosse
40,Some good entertainment,"Usually we don’t visit Madame Tussaud’s, but this one is really nice. Some dolls come with props so you can let out the actor within. Interesting facts to read. Bought tickets online, which made everything smooth. Prices for photos are a bit exaggerated.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MalinSanna
40,Life Like,Great Wax Figures... Modern celebrities to icons... loved Ingrid Bergman from Casablanca... Rockey ... Marilyn Monroe... spaced out nicely... not crowded... very impressive... A Must See,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lroesener
50,A nice experience,"Bought tickets online! I highly recommend that. You can spend at least a couple of hours inside if you buy the ultimate experience that include the main access, the guide book, a picture each ticket, your own wax hand (watch out if you have a lot of hairs!!!). If you start reading details along the walls you can easily reach three hours visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emanuelea660
50,Madame Tussaud’s museum,"AMAZING!The wax figures themselves are fabulous, had so much fun posing with all my favourite stars. The attention to detail is second to none, from the details on the hands and faces, to their amazing outfits and their lifelike hair (which I found kind of creepy to be honest haha).Took a lot longer than I thought to get through it all so I would recommend setting aside at least and hour (that’s how long it took us an we were rushing through because we had other things to do that evening).There was even an opportunity to have your own hands made into wax at the end (extra cost) and professional photos with ET (also extra). 10/10 recommend for adults and children of all ages.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/samanthar632
40,Fun!,We thoroughly enjoyed our visit and took a great many photos. Was certainly worth the visit and would recommend it. Some figures look uncannily real.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christinahS8130QR
50,Excellent Wax Museum,Really enjoyed walking around this place. They had lots to see and some look very real. My kids and I really had a great time. Timing was perfect not too crowded and enjoyed the Hollywood Walk.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lizmirjac
40,Fun time for a family,Took my 2 teenage children to this attraction during a trip several years ago. I was skeptical that they'd enjoy it but they had fun posing with all the celebrity look-alikes. Some of the areas has props so you could really interact with the wax figures. Not sure I'd pay full price for this attraction but we were using the LA Go Card so it was included.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TaraM1903
30,And then we have seen that,"Great figures of wax, but again then we have seen it, and I probably won't go back again.We also got caught in the touristtrap with the valetparking. So, don't park at the valet. Apparently there's a cheaper parking just before the valet where you can validate your ticket and get it cheaper.Still a good experience, just not great.Afterwards we took a little stroll up the walk og fame.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Diskolydia
40,very good enjoyable,"very good, enjoyed all the wax figures. very lifelike. the 4d show was great. would recommend. the only thing was the parking. very expensive. $18.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/juicee000
50,Fun time with celebrity look-alikes,"I thought the figures would be in a display that you could look at, instead they are out in the open. You can stand next to them and get your picture taken. There are even props with some of the figures that you can use to make your picture more realistic.There is a modern hall and then another area with classic Hollywood actors and actresses.A little pricey, but a fun hour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ericw824
40,Very impressed,"I had only ever visited Madame Tussauds in London until my visit to Hollywood recently and I was as impressed as I was when I went to the museum in London!As a non-American visitor, I knew almost all of the celebrities really well so don't worry about not knowing any of the celebs if you are not American!Different areas of Madame Tussauds are dedicated to different theme, like pop icons, Hollywood film stars, sports stars, cowboys etc. There is an area that is suited to anyone- for me, my favourite area was the pop icons where there was Demi Lovato, Lady Gaga, Jason Derulo, Madonna etc! Other areas also had Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie, Steven Spielberg, Elvis, Clint Eastwood, Audrey Hepburn...The wax figures are always being rotated don't set your heart on seeing one star in particular as there is a chance that that celebrity might not be there when you visit. However, with this being said, if you are still unsure as to whether you know any of the celebrities there, I would take a look on Google Images to see which celebrities they have there.There was also a souvenir shop at the end of it and everything in the star was being sold for $5 which was an absolute bargain for souvenirs, especially in the centre of Hollywood! This wasn't a one day thing either because when I walked past it a few days later, the offer was still on!Also, the staff were very friendly. And because there was a queue, which really wasn't very long at all, a staff member came up to us and gave us a generous discount off our ticket price!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fayeo126
40,It really was a good day,"I visited it before in Sydney,,it has the same idea, i think it is enough to visit it two teams,but for those who have not visited it before,,they will find it more than beautiful",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sherifcpm
50,Great fun loads of photos,"The figures are incredibly lifelike and the whole attraction flows really well through each zone of celebrity and famous folk. It is a great place to have fun together and take photos with the famous, most of whom have actually sat for their figure production which makes the whole story come to life even more!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BurlsGurth
50,A waxy good time,"My 10 year old son and I went here to kill time. We enjoyed it. Took about an hour. The 4D Avengers movie was great. Some really fun pictures and a few of the wax figures I had to do a double and triple check on. Simon Cowell on the couch was eerily life like in my opinion. The Lady Gaga was impressive as well as Howard Hughes. Of course my son liked Thor. Bottom line, get your tickets online and save some money. Worth the experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melodyd337
40,Visit Madame Tussauds,"Enjoyable walk through! The short animation of Marvel characters at the end was good. Left feeling like we should have seen more figures.The advertised deal can be beat if you find some of the ""two for the price of one"" flyers in the lobby of your hotel amongst local attractions. Parking around the side of the building was $18. Nice bathrooms inside the theater.Overall glad we went.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Raymond112
50,Pictures are fun,We had a wonderful time at this place. Beware that there are different prices for people. Walk up and down Hollywood and Highland and get a 50% discount from a vendor that is on the street. It will help make the museum affordable for families or get online priced tickets. We witnessed only a very small paper sign for the price of tickets that suggested that prices fluctuated and depends on time or day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shereetravel
50,What a super fun time.,What a fun time. I couldn’t tell the difference between the statues and other patrons. I got spooked several times. So much fun and worth every cent.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MargieBracken
40,Ok,"Good 2 hour experia .Expected more.3 floor wax statues.Each floor around 20 of them.Nice photo op with some of them as they ofer custune ar props to use.The last station is a 4d advandure, nice.The kids realy liked then.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/micha_kedem
30,Sometimes scary,"There are 3 floors of waxed bodies. Its sometimes scary walking around, they look like dead bodies. We thought the older persona are more realistic. We thought it was interesting to be standing next to them and see how tall or short they are. Its worth a trip knowing there are little chance you can bumped into those famous people.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NancyDayton_Ohio
40,This was a blast!,"We have one of these in my hometown, but this was a lot of fun. Had a great time acting like we were with the stars. Relatively cheap entertainment for a few hours. Got some great pics and memories.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melbo99
50,Funny,"Lady Gaga was really impressive! The rest is great also, and you can freely take photos with your favorite celebreties!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeniseBA2019
50,Loved this museum!!!,"This was by far my favorite museum in Hollywood! I had so much fun! And best of all we didn’t even pay full price! As you walk the Hollywood Walk of Fame, there is usually employees handing out coupons that includes 50% admission ticket. I would really recommend to take advantage of that! Awesome museum and very friendly employees!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alinagomez11
50,"Family with Teens, First Visit to LA, Must See!",This was our favorite place to visit in LA. Weird but we were completely impressed with how life like these figures were. My husband and 2 teenage girls arrived mid day on a Thursday and spent a little over an hour inside the wax museum. It was super fun seeing how short these people actually are. Also how real they seemed. We had fun interacting and taking pictures. Plenty of current celebrities as well as popular iconic. Highly recommend this visit with teens.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/heathersW4154PT
50,Great time,I have been to two other museums & none are the same. I love how they all have different wax figures and setups.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lisav974
50,Fun time tricking friends,"The wax museum was one of my teenagers favorite attraction in Hollywood. The famous people looked so real and it was so fun to take any pose you liked with them. I was impressed with the fine detail in their skin, hair, teeth and body!!! When they posted the pictures on Instagram some of their friends thought we saw real celebrities... !!! Very well done and worth the money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shaydel4kids
50,Amazing,The celebrities are so life like it’s creepy. It makes you wonder if they are going to jump up and say something to you. Definitely would recommend.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O2834QOjenniferm
30,Fun way to spend a couple of hours,We recently spent a couple of hours at Madame Tussauds Hollywood and although my 13 year old thought it was way 'too cringy' myself and my 10 year old had a blast! My husband was the dedicated photographer and seemed to have a lot of fun photographing us. You really have to embrace the experience and get into character to enjoy the full experience. It provides awesome photo opportunities and great memories which I'm sure will keep me smiling for years to come :) No waiting in line and nice to just stroll around leisurely and enjoy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nurunesa
10,awful,Not worth the time. Save your money. Most of the figures did not look as they should. Lines were very long,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barbaradI6725SO
30,Only if it could be larger!!,"The museum is fine with all the figures looking so real! However we were expecting many more latest/popular figures. The collection seems just too little for this museum in Hollywood which is supposed to showcase the power and achievements of Hollywood!! We couldn’t see Tom Hanks, Tom Cruise, Matt Damon, Dwayne Johnson, De Carpio, etc but more the great stars in the 70s/80s...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alyf38
50,Look who I met in Hollywood!,"From the moment you enter, you are captured by the huge King Kong, hunky Zac Ephron and beautiful Marilyn Monroe. When you ascend to the 2nd floor there is a paparazzi so lifelike that we waited until he was done with his photo before crossing his path! There are so many celebrities from today and yesteryear that you are sure to find someone you always wanted to meet and snap that iconic photo. We loved the props you are allowed to use to make it feel like you are really a part of their world. Awesome place!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ssjarama
40,"Great to visit, try to get discount voucher entry.","We were going to visit here anyway, but we discovered our 48 hour tickets on Starlight Tours included free entry tickets, so we jumped at the chance to visit for free! Got some great pics of my wife and granddaughter cuddling Elvis, Michael Jackson, and a number of other famous stars without getting the slightest bit jealous...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlenC527
40,Good fun especially if you get the evening ticket,We were staying in Hollywood so made sure to get our ticket online in advance and chose the evening admission which was a bargain price. Usual array of waxworks to pose with and they included a few props to really get in the spirit of things.....Good way to spend an hour or so...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pattenr
50,Must visit,"The is one of those must see places even if its only once, very well set out very realistic wax figures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/57chevycustom
50,Rub shoulders with over 100 stars,"We had a good time posing with many of the stars or being in costume with them. Though it was busy, we never had to wait. Absolutely buy your tickets ahead on line. We saved 35% and skipped the long line waiting to buy tickets. It was a great 90 minutes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thomaspZ9286SG
30,Nice,"On my opinion it's quite expensive even I know it's a LOT of work to make the wax figures.It's funny and some of them look really great, some just similar to ""their"" humans.You can touch the figures and get a lot of good pictures. But the place seems always crowded and you have to wait for a good pic.We had a combo offer - Madame T and Universal Studios, so it was an acceptable value. It was my second visit there and some figures changed or were added.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/misscalifornia1
50,Fun thing to do!,Definitely a fun thing to do for the family. The wax replicas were spot on! There were props by each figure so you could take fun pictures. Definitely recommend!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Begley071902
50,Fun for the kids!,"This was included in our Go City card, so we stopped in. The kids had a blast taking pictures with all of the wax figures. It only takes about 45 minutes to an hour depending on how many pics you take. A good little place for an hour of fun. Staff was very friendly!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jodilynn3
50,Best of the bunch!,"Fantastic fun and the wax figures are really accurate. Despite being middle of July, lines were short and easy to take photos with favorites.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/287stephanieo
50,They look so real.,"Seriously, some of the figures do look real. But what fun to see your favorite stars of past and present and get your picture with them. We’ve been the MT here in Hollywood, New York and Las Vegas. (I’ve reviewed those, too).Great fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Patrioticpatriot1
20,Overrated.,"This was a waste of money. The entire museum is super cheesy and unfortunately most of the wax statues are pretty unrealistic. It was nice to get out of the heat, that was the plus. Skip this and save your money for something else.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Baue10
30,"Pretty cool, but honestly pretty creepy","Awesome for kids. Everything was very clean. This was my first time visiting a wax museum, and I gotta say... it’s pretty creepy. We scored 2 for 1 tickets, I wouldn’t have paid full price for this attraction. There is just not a lot to see here. Our favorite section was the Marvel exhibit, and the old Hollywood section.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tothemaxor
50,Picture taking fun,Had a blast being silly and talking funny pictures with the famous wax figures. My 10 year old daughter was in heaven with all the pop stars and actors of her time while my son who is also 10 had a great time with the super hero’s. The photo props outside were great and we had a wonderful time!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2xsthelove
20,Interesting,"While the exhibit is interesting, it's not particularly fun. At 7pm Madam Tussauds was incredibly crowded, with people pushing and long lines to look at certain wax figures. The figures themselves are super interesting, and 90% of them are as life-like as you'd expect.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alisiyag2017
50,Fun pictures!,"Went here with my 12 year old niece. Booked online and saved a lot of money. We went around noon and it was super busy, so we decided to go back at 8 pm and it wasn’t busy at all. Had a blast taking pictures 😊",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/724adriannal
50,Great fun had by all,We had a Go Pass and this was included. We never do these and my kids were not keen on it but once there we had a blast taking pictures with our favorite wax mummies.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rockobello
50,Great fun posing with the famous figures from many eras,Not only are the wax figures pretty accurate in looks but they also appear to be the correct height for the celebrity. I joined my daughter and granddaughter in touring the three floors of wax figures. All three of us had a lot of fun. Many props are provided so that you can pose from a memorable part in a movie. Easy to move along at your own pace.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marybethIowa
30,Great figures,"Everything is great, the location, the figures, the props, the attention, but don’t go here with small children, the museum is really big so they get tired often, and there is nowhere to sit. But if it’s a family without small kids, it’s a MUST VISIT!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/valea521
40,Pretty Cool,Madame Tussauds + Starline Movie Stars' Home Tour combo package.Thoroughly enjoyed the wax museum. I could've skipped the homes tour and stayed at the wax museum. Three or more floors to linger and enjoy. Great gift shop. The online cost of $20 was a great value. Most of the wax figures were pretty realistic. I would return.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jcpadie58
30,It's fun,We did this as part of the Hollywood homes tour.It's a bit of fun but as there is so much to do in LA that if youre only there for a short space of time I would say give it a miss and do something else.It is entertaining but there are more fun things in LA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/snooks23
50,Amazing,"My daughters and I went to Madame Tussauds last summer and It was amazing because the wax figures were so lifelike of Jack Nicholson, Robert Redford, Dorothy from The Wizard of oz, Michael Jackson, John Travolta as Danny Zuko in Grease and Greased Lightning. There were many others and these are memories that we will have for the rest of our lives.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/526shawnas
50,Great time,"We had a lot of fun here. Loved that there are figures from many eras. It's also fun that you can use props for pictures, too. We made wax hands and saw the 4D Avengers movie which were both fun. All the staff were really nice. Takes about an hour to hour and a half to go through.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amandar6152018
50,A must see in Hollywood,We visited Madame Tussaud’s wax museum while on family vacation. It was a fun experience for both myself and my pre teen kids. There were 3 stories of stars and Most statues looked unbelievably real and we all had fun taking our pictures with our favorite stars.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/birthdaybride
50,For wax museums... the best in Hollywood,"I was there in May, and it was definitely a good experience.Each wax model looked very polished and well done. Unlike a few other museums in the area, the job was very pristine and it looked so real.Not really a large or huge place, but worth the visit. You might tour the whole place in maybe around 1.5 hours top.In my opinion, slightly pricy for all it has, but if you´ve never visited a wax museum, it´s probably a must-do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carlosvirgilioa
40,Fun trip,We went with two teens who had a good time. Nice mix of classic figures and modern. Will only take you an hour or so to go through.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanaQ_12
50,Feel among the stars!,You can take as many pictures as you like with your favourite celebrities' wax statues. They are amazing and resemble very close to actual celebrities.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/faiz-ras00l
50,FABULOUS and super fun,"Absolutely LOVED this place. I've been to the Hollywood Wax Museum before but this place seems to have a better was faces ... more realistic ... in my opinion. We bought our tickets online and received a decent discount along with discounted extras. I received the guide for $5, three photos free and three wax hands for $7 each along with our entry fee. You can stay as long as you like. There are three floors of figures with plenty of room to enjoy, and take fun photos with the wax stars. So very realistic, friendly staff and having the wax hands done is fun and an interesting process. Worth the cost.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mburbank2016
50,It's fun,"I confused this place with Ripleys down the road, my mistake all the way. This is exactly what you think this place is. Wax Celebrity look-alikes with people taking photos with Each and Every One of Them!! I'm only leaving a review for this place because the staff was very helpful regarding the museum and the Hollywood area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nicktt440
50,Entertaining!,"Was surprised at how much I enjoyed it! I would not do it without a coupon, which was not hard to find (got one from our hotel- I think it was buy one, get one half off). The figures are really well-done and its really interesting to see how tall/short stars actually are. Would recommend!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elisejumo
50,Fun Spot,"This is a wonderful stop for families and friends while in this area. It is very well done, all the wax figures look so real. They are all set up very well were it is easy to take good pictures with them and not have others in the background. I would go back again!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paigemcfarland21
40,Fun Time!,We have visited Madame Tussaud’s in NY and were excited to visit in LA. This is always a fun place to visit. The wax figures look real the staff was friendly.I would recommend this a s part of any trip.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevenhD4733WL
20,Badly treated by security,"When I booked our tickets from the UK for our trip to LA last month standard hours were advertised open until 8pm.So we turn up at 6pm to find the shutters down, confused my son asked in Starbucks next door who told him is was shut for a private event, prom or similar.I noticed a adjacent door which belonged to a tour company and went in to see if I could find out anything. I was faced with a security man who was really intimidating and rude and basically physically edged me out of the door whilst telling me 'its not my problem', and 'thats the way it is' come back tomorrow and finished off with a sarcastic 'have a nice day' .....I was having a nice day up until that point.Anyway we had a window of an hour before our Amtrak the next morning and after speaking with the manager we were able to visit for an hour, but the biggest disappointment was the the whole purpose of this visit for my daughter to see the wax of Leonardo DiCaprio and he was having a referb. Because of the time shortage we were not able to do the 4D experience either.Its a great fun place but for the reasons above it was a complete anticlimax for us.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/19dmt68
40,Lots of fun and great photo opportunities,Madam Tussauds is world famous as the best at creating wax works and there were only a few duds inside that looked like they were poorly created. They also set up some great photo opportunities by providing costumes that you can put on to make the photos even better - these are free to use using your own camera e.g. boxing gloves to stand next to Rocky or a mafia hat to sit next to the godfather.Official price is $30 per adult but falls to $20 if you book online. It is also included as part of the Go Los Angeles Card - this costs c$200 for 3 days although on Groupon it is sometimes cheaper. If you are going to go to Universal Studios and Warner Bros then the pass pays for itself and you get to see this essentially for free.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WorldTravellerfromGB
50,Great,We were dropped of in our bus tour by the Hollywood Boulevard so we tried the Madam Tusaaud(sorry if i misspelled it). We paid like 30 plus USD . It was great to see those wax figures. Looks like very real. We took lots of pictures. We had fun!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sumanism
40,Great!,"We came here to get some time out of the sun. I was not disappointed, there is a large collection and they are very lifelike. I would recommend it",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VictoriaFxx
40,The Other One,"This museum is adjacent to the Grauman Chinese Theater on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Lifelike statues of celebrities are displayed in different time periods. Upon entering, photos of your group are taken in different poses, which you can purchase at the end of the tour, which wasn't long enough for me. Just my opinion. You are allowed to take pictures on your own, as long as you don't touch them. Ticket prices are reasonable and this attraction is good for kids and is handicapped accessible. It's a nice way to spend the afternoon. BTW, the other museum is down the street near Vine.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ebonycowgirl
40,Madame Tussauds Hollywood,"LocationAt the walk of fame LA.ExperienceThe way they have presented and given the life to those was structures, just for a glance you will feel that they all are alive around you. Beautifully done amazing place once in a lifetime experience specially if u are a art lover. I just love the Marilyn Munro.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/worldsourhome
40,The closest you're gonna get to kiss Snoop Dogg,"Wax figures of A-listers adorn the interior of Madamme Tussauds and make for happy snapping and (in)appropriate selfies. There is also a Marvel 4D experience in there and is um.. interesting.Don't be a tourist and pay full price. Its cheaper to book online OR get coupons from nearby stores.I know there's also a gift shop but didn't really dive into it, so no comments there.Worth a visit if this is your thing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravellingTwos
50,Great fun,"My first ever visit to madam Tussaud’s, me and my partner had a great laugh, the marvel 4d experience was great too, we got a great deal on photos and can’t wait to download them.Would definitely visit again",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/helenmr2018
40,"Lots of fun, don’t pay full price!","This is a fun place to spend some time taking photos with your favorite celebs. It takes about an hour to go through, don’t pay full price. There is a half off coupon for online orders and there are also coupons in the area. Best to go during the day if you have younger children, Hollywood is nasty, dirty, and generally a disgusting place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kevinwcheryl
50,Changes since previous visits,"The gift shop has shifted to next door, there are some virtual experience options, as well as more photo opportunities. Time to visit again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jannineseymour
40,Liked it!,"It was my first experience of Madame Tussauds and didnt disappoint at all. Surprisingly I stayed there for more than an hour, and came out happy. Overall worth visiting this place, and get close to celebrities for a click",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/badshahazam
30,Interesting for those who have never been,"Theoretically, it’s an art museum, one that is WAY overpriced (makes sense though, very touristy and expensive area). We found a coupon on the street for half off (thus $15 a head), and for that I have ZERO complaints, quick walkthrough about 30-45 minutes. My friend LOVED this place, I truly didn’t care, then again I hardly care for much “pop culture.” Great wax statues, is a gimmick",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cstruyk
30,"Over-priced, Tourist-trap","We visited here a few days ago because my daughter had a coupon and she really likes wax museums. It is not really my thing, and in my opinion, it was over-priced (even with the coupon) and a big tourist-trap. That being said, I can certainly appreciate the real artistry of the figures. The likeness to the real-life person portrayed was amazing on some of them. We visited on a Friday afternoon about 3 p.m.and there was a very short line to get in. It was not really crowded at this time of day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/349ChristineN
20,PLEASE MAKE A BRITNEY SPEARS FIGURE,"I came to this Madame tussards in Hollywood, expecting with the slightest doubt that the world famous Pop Icon Superstar BRITNEY SPEARS would be in the museum. To my wasted $60.00, she was no where in the museum, and I was mislead and deceived by the many photos of her figure around the exhibits. How could they have nearly every famous Pop Star except for the Princess of Pop herself?! I really hope the Madame Tussards managers see this and rethink adding Britney to the iconic Hollywood residence because there are thousands of Britney fans who are willing to through their money into the establishment just to get a picture with her. BIG mistake for not including the one and only pop ICON.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jamesmaverick
20,Not all glitz and glam,"When you see these locations on TV or the movies you think they are going to be fancy and clean. Madame Tussauds falls in line with the rest of the walk of fame with lots of trashy rap artists trying to sell their bad EP's to you, or some bald superman that wants $5 for his picture with you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andrewbmusic
50,We had fun!,"We have so much fun at wax museums, and MT’s is no exception. We spent almost two hours inside. I wish they had more wax statues, as always!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/feljones2004
40,Free pass with hop on hop off bus,"We bought a hop on hop ticket and it included a free pass to Madame Tussaud’s. There are many figures, mostly from showbiz. Some are excellent likenesses other you know who the person is but it’s not quite right. We wouldn’t have paid the entry fee.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/791anitat
50,So much fun,Enjoyed all the costumes that you could use to pose next to some of your favorite stars . Great selection of celebrities def visit if you get a chance,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/parselll
50,Visit if you have the cash,If you cant see the stars in person. Here is the place to go for a little bit of fun. Very good models and friendlt staff. Take loads of pictures.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Latoyaa1
30,As expected,"Very touristy, but kids seem to enjoy it. It is expensive, but the kids enjoyed it and they had some impressive exhibits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pedz55
40,Great Family Activity,"Different than expected, but lots of fun to be had with a camera. The characters are posed for some awesome shots, and there are props to be used as well. Fun facts and quizzes also.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Q2016QZlisaf
30,Wax museum is cool,"I have already in 2 Madames Tussaud: one in Brazil/ Gramado and another in Holywood. In my opinion, o Madame from Holywood there are more famous wax people, but i dont recommind to go in differents places because the attractions are similars",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrunoAntonioli
40,Attraction was Fun to Visit,"We enjoyed the celebrity wax figures! Most are very lifelike and look just like the celebrity. Others not so much. You can stand/sit by the was figures and take your picture. Displays are on 3 different floors with about 6 to 10 figures on each. They try to force you to have them take your picture before you take the tour. If you are not interested, you still have to wait, but you can tell them when you get to the front of the line that you want to decline the photo and only continue with the tour. Warning Outside Madame Toussads: Be very careful, there were people trying to pick pocket, shoving homemade cd's in your face, etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sandi8697
50,Sooooo COOL!!!!,"My husband, two teenage sons, mother, and I visited this location on Saturday and it was sooooo cool!!! It was fun to see stand or sit beside wax figures of celebrities that you’ll probably never meet in person. Although some of the faces were off, MOST of them were spot on!! There were lots of celebrities to see from the last to the present. I still cannot get over how small Vivien Leigh’s waist was while filming Gone With The Wind.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/miercolesb
40,Interesting museum,The museum is ok. It is fun to take pics with your favorite celebrities. I dont think I would go back again to this location.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MartinMDQ
30,An interesting museum,"It's cheesy, but that's part of it's charm. We went at almost closing time so we got a deal on our tickets. Fun photo ops, but not really much else.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/536amief
40,Fun with kids.,"The last time I was there, I was with a very young child and bored to tears. This time my grandson (11) really wanted to go and we did. He loved it.If you love wax figures of movie stars and others, this is the place for you. That is what it is, a museum of wax figures placed in a setting, dressed in whatever they are famous for. For example, you may see Marilyn Monroe dressed from a famous scene in a movie. They have so many figures, from older stars to newer celebrities.Parking is a bear. It is expensive. But all of Hollywood is like that. Try for street parking, but mind the signs. They have a cute gift shop and you will be there an hour or more. You can often get discount tickets on line or on the street in Hollywood. It is also nice and cool inside.If you have a kid, they will love it and there excitement will allow you to have fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elizabethlascheid
40,Good Cheesy Fum,Agree with a previous reviewer (cheesy fun). There are a couple of figures Betty and Audrey that are simply fantastic. Others seem a bit “off.” Good for an hour of fun. Pick non peak hours. We visited at 9pm and did not need to work around other visitors much.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/steveandpatty3
50,Always a fun place,I have visited several of these in several cities. They are always a lot of fun. You can put on outfits and pose for crazy pictures with the wax figures. The animation movie was great.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F1683DMdavidh
50,Good cheesy fun,"Yes it's cheesy, but it's good fun for an hour. My 11 year old LOVED all her selfies with celebs. We bought the Go LA Pass and this was included so that made it worthwhile and didn't make me feel like I was wasting money on a short experience. Area outside is a little nutty with crowds, people trying to sell you stuff and just general mayhem.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/07travelchick
40,Very Cool Place,We visited here on a Friday morning as soon as it open which was really nice because we didn't have to wait to take pictures with the figures as it were not very many people there. Only took us about an hour and a half to get through it all and at the end you can stay and watch a 3D Marvel video which was very cool. Was a little disappointed that they did not have the Selena figure because she is the one we really wanted to see. Overall the kids thought it was very cool to be able to take pictures next to some of their favorite people.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emilyo825
30,Las Vegas Museum Better,"Nice visit but compared to the Las Vegas location, much smaller and less exhibits. Did not care for the pushy worker there who forces you and your family to take a photo before entering and then tries to sell you the photo at the end. Was able to get discount by paying online via their website.. so glad I did not pay full price.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SnazzyC2
40,Fun afternoon if you have 1-2 hour open,"Gate is is not funny actually boring and a queue time that exceed my expectations.Once inside everything changes. It has been 25 years since last visit.The essence is the same, but now you can interact with the character and dress upWe had a nice moment my wife and me, but my 5 year old didn't it need a section of character according to her age that the museum does not have",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ecalza2015
40,Excellent!!,"Worth the visit!! Lots of fun and you get to take great pics!! Plus it’s on the Hollywood walk of fame, right next to the Chinese theatre!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CoronitaExtra
30,Disappointed,"This was my 2nd visit and although the figures were amazing the museum was not up to date. I always enjoy seeing the current president and he was non existent. It would have been nice to see more new entertainment icons as well. Ed Sheehan, Ariana grande. Katy perry?Maybe next time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FranA935
50,Nice,"Nice place to visit. If visiting after 5:00 p.m., book the discounted option on their web site. Awesome wax models.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lapulapul
30,If you have never been to a Madame Tussaud’s you do need to go once,There is no arguing that the work is exceptional. The figures are eerily life like and you can get some cool photos of you and your family with famous people. That said it is very pricey and I won’t suggest that you need to a second time. Our teen age girls were happy with a few of the exhibits but a lot were from too far in the past.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/markandcathycalgary
30,Its ok.,"Interactive exhibits and costumes for you to put on. Not very many figures overall. 4d ride at the end made it worthwhile however, we had a Go LA card so the price was included . I would never spend the enterance price they wanted.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CodyB1124
40,Good to see,"Very well laid out and easy to navigate round so you don't miss anything. Some props available for use for taking your own photos to be in keeping with a theme. Some exhibits did look dated, but that is how most of the stars are remembered. Plenty of charactors to see. A good mix. Worth the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SJS_travels2014
30,Somewhat disappointing,"We recently went to Madame Tussaud’s in Hollywood during our time in Los Angeles. My daughter and I were extremely excited to go since we had been to the one in London and it was fabulous. The price is a little expensive at the door so I would suggest buying tickets online to save some money. Parking is relatively easy since there is a parking lot right around the corner from the facility. Once we got in we started our visit. I only gave it a three stars because I didn’t feel like there were that many exhibits. I think we were in and out in less than an hour. Perhaps only 45 minutes to do all of the exhibits. I thought this was not worth the money and was not very exciting. Having only been to the one in London which was incredible with lots and lots of exhibits and an interactive room, I was disappointed in the Hollywood one. If you have never been to Madame Tussauds you might enjoy this OK, but again not nearly as good as the London one.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanieBrown
40,"A fun time, but not a need to go","My sister was here and she wanted to go, so we did. It was fun. The models are so creepy, but it was a good time. The place is big and worth the price if you get the tickets online. Don't buy in the line, you can order online while in line and get in for much cheaper. Its worth it so just go if you can't find anything else on the list.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tykane01
40,Well worth the visit,"When we stepped off the elevator, we were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the wax figures. Several I thought were real people about to prank us. And just when you thought the exhibit was over, another room around the corner provided additional entertainment. Great for families of all ages and photo opportunities.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanK173
40,Realistic Figures and 4D Movie,"Stopped in here on a whim and while it was a smaller museum than I expected, with the discount coupon it was well worth a visit. I especially liked that there are scenes where you can ""interact"" with the wax figures for photo ops and the 4D movie was an unexpected and enjoyable surprise.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EconMom
50,Madame Tussauds Hollywood,Purchased the ticket from Groupon. Very inexpensive. Really enjoyed it. Very nice work. They almost look real.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/heathersemreen
40,Happy I finally made it to one of these!,"It was nice to finally see one of these museums in person and in my opinion 90% of the figures really resembled the actual person. It was slightly on the expensive side, although we did get a little bit of a break on the cost of each ticket because we bought a $4 wax figure book. Different wax figures are located at each location, so there is a variety between the museums. The employees space you out as you enter so you you aren't bunched up when inside, so there was very little wait for us to take pictures with the wax figures and less of a chance of having other people in the background of your photo. It look us just under an hour to get through most likely because of the rain that day that left us with a very short wait in line, but I can see this visit taking up to 2 hours if there was better weather and a longer line.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CAB2662
50,Spring Break-My daughter isn't a teenager though,Madame Tussauds Hollywood was a very cool attraction and tourist site. The wax images were very close to the likeness of the celebrities. The sets were nice and were also interactive. No one was breathing down your back and you could view at your own pace.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shawnl285
50,Perfect!!,I thought I really met all the people I saw there. They look very real and I recommend you to have the wax hand!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ludson
50,Amazing,"I have been in a long time, and we enjoyed all the characters. Even with 16year the were able to recognize the majority. My daughter really love the ability to take a picture dancing with Patrick Swayze> Don’t miss this experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/73cheriej
50,LA Day Trip,"We recently flew into LA for the day with our three children (ages 9, 12, and 15). We did the typical Hollywood things, including Madam Tussauds Hollywood. I did not have high expectations, but I was very impressed with the number and quality of the celebrities represented. Our kids loved it!! I think we took a photo with almost every figure. This was worth the price of admission.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rhpeters
50,So life like,"Great opportunity for photos with the stars. So life like, interesting seeing how tall some were, it was fun taking pics with them. Lots of stars from old Hollywood classics to the latest.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GoranYag70
40,Many photo ops to be taken!,"If you love photo ops and/ or Instagram, this is the place for you! Many famous celebs to pose with. We had a blast!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sloaner83
40,Not bad,I liked the ending where we saw the 4d theatre experience. Other than that there were a few statues and amazing facts. However there were not that many statues as the one in London or in Hong Kong. It was spread out on 3 floors and I was able to recognise everyone I saw.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sauditraveller
30,Fun,Fun to visit with all ages and take some silly photos. It’s a bit pricey but so is everything in this area! Worth a stop.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vacationplannerMa
50,Madame Tussauds is always great!,"We love the wax museums wherever we travel, and this one was great! There are all your Hollywood favorites, from now and long ago.It is in a busy area, just near Dolby Theater. I recommend getting tickets online, so you don't wait in line. Also, sometimes there are online discounts.Bring your camera! Great for the whole family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/347LINDAB
50,Totally realistic!,My husband and I enjoyed this very much. We purchased our discounted tickets on their website..basically 2 tickets for the price of one. It was so realistic and the details are extraordinary!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LunaSol2018
50,New York or California both are spectacular,"If you don't think it would be fun to go to a wax museum, think again. As you enter the world of real people from all generations and fame are there to walk by, take pictures with and live with them for a few minutes. Easy to get lost in there for hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cszostak
50,Fun Time,"We had a blast here. I want to say that we spent something like 30 bucks to get in for 2 of us. I really didn't know what to expect. The last wax museum we went to was really crappy, so maybe I didn't have high expectations. This place blew my mind! you are allowed to interact with the figures, touch them and pose for pictures with them. They were so life like......even from a couple inches away. It was almost freaky sometimes cause it felt like they were really there. Parking garage in the lower level gives you a nice place to park centrally on Hollywood Blvd. I wouldn't miss this if you are there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrianC463
40,fun with the famous,"Quality of the wax figures is amazing. It was strange to come out the lift and be face to face with Elton John. My teenage kids took selfies with Lady Ga Ga, Taylor Swift, and Ryan Reynolds. I liked Hallie Berry, Angelina Jolie, Will Smith and Daniel Craig. The cowboys were good - Clint Eastwood, John Wayne, Robert Redford and Paul Newman. It also struck me some are not that tall - Rocky, Judy Garland. the Godfather scene was cool too. We had a great time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/simonjpayne2017
40,Wax glory,"Was great to view all the wax works we had fun. The price however was a bit dear it was $54.90 for 1 adult 1 child, if you can find discount vouchers grab them. I didn't like however at the end it finishes in a clothing/merchandise shop i thought that was really odd.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SingleMumTravels
40,Good bit of fun,We got free admission with the bus tour that we did. There were 3 levels to this and the sculpture’s look fantastic. You can take photos and touch the figures but no touching the hair or faces. You will see some of the stars in the walk of fame ( to see them all is a 5 km walk). Madame Tousauds is right next to the TCL Theatre and you will see stars hand and footprints in the concrete here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spunkeemunkee
30,Tacky but fun,"Ive always avoided this tourist trap around the world, but got dragged in with some friends and actually enjoyed it.. self explanetory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Antinmelb
40,Fun Morning,These are so life like! We were literally waiting for people to jump out at us (like some videos) they are so life like. Miss 11 had a great time posing with the props and characters. Well worth the effort and $.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KiwiFamily0f3
50,Fun & Laughs!,"Had so much fun here. So many of the statues look so real. Took pics with so many celebrities. I thought our pics looked funny cause we are dressed like tourists and the celebs are dressed in sequence dresses and suits. LOL!This was our first time visiting a Madame Tussauds, great experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FP7020
40,"almost Real, fun","a nice destination while you are in the Walk of fame area, where you will be able to take selfies and pictures with many celebrities not only hollywood celebrities but many more like sport and presidents and all.they look almost real, some of them needs more modifications while others looks just perfect.they have too many of them, it is around 2 hours, honestly after one hour you will feel bored because you are just doing the same thing again and again even if it is with a new character, but still it is a good place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anasjabeiti
40,Wax museum Hollywood,Visiting the Madame Tousseau museum was more that I imagined. A must thing to do while visiting Hollywood. Great experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elained122
40,It was surprisingly pleasant,"I did not intend to visit them but because it was so close to the other attractions and I had the Go Card, I went. It was very nice! The majority of them the statues really look like alive!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/corinnetani
50,Hello Hollywood,"This was our first visit to Madame Tussaud’s Wax Museum with our family. The Hollywood Stars will lead you there as they are right outside. Our family had an amazing time. We arrived around 1:30 in the afternoon on a Saturday and surprisingly it wasn’t as crowded as I expected, lines to take pictures with the wax figures moved along quickly. We spent about 2 1/2 hours taking fun pics with these beautifully made celebrities. There were some props available and even a 4D show to enjoy ! My 11 and 14 year olds had a blast and not to mention Dad had great time as well. Very clean and great lighting. You never know who’s gonna be around the corner is what made it so exciting. We even got pics with Obama! We recommend you start your Hollywood visit here. Parking is available for $2 an hour or $15 a day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/heidisB4767CX
40,Worth a visit,We actually had no plans to visit Madame Tussaud’s but as we had booked a tour of Hollywood Hills they gave us free tickets to visit. So we took up the free offer and really enjoyed it 😊We did see many people just walking in and purchasing tickets at full price so again read the reviews to learn where to pick up a bargain.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sandy-andy-Andy
20,Museum was good but the staff was horrible,The lady at the wax hand was in a bad mood...!!!I am here at the wax hand and she had us stop in the middle (I was recording it) to go get a voucher to show her I paid already...please learn to treat tourists better.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrunoSze
40,Good Family Fun,"The Grandchildren were keen to go, we bought a combination ticket to Toussauds and a two hour LA City Bus Tour. The kids had a great time with the wax statues, putting on the props provided for great photos, it took us an hour to get through but imagine if it were very busy it would take longer, I had never been before and found most of the statues were very like the people they represented, good fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sunshineqld
40,Pictures with Stars,"We went there in the evening but there were still quite many visitors. They divided into different floors and themes (e.g. western, action, superheroes...) and my kids loved taking pictures with all the ""stars"". Be prepared to spend 1-2 hours there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CCMMZhang
50,Madame T.,This was great a great experience.Wanted to see it for years so took another trip and took kids back to see it few months later and they found it to be all we said and they enjoyed making their hand prints in hot wax to take home. All our hand wax works as been put on shelves for all to see.Enjoyed many artists from movies and people in government as well. Nice show case of works .Wished they had someone on both floors to helping in answering some of ours and the kids questions with some answers on some of what we saw that we wonder about.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/13521F2
30,Ok once,Very expensive and not nearly as good as one in SF. Kids had fun taking goofy photos with the wax figures. It was an aha moment when our 9 year old twins starting asking who some of the people were. Ouch. it was a fun family experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NovelleL
50,Attraction was great,This attraction keeps getting better and better. I've been to a lot of Madame Tussaud's and this is one of the better ones. The themed rooms are perfect and the figures looked fantastic. Great job to Colin and the team!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WorldTraveler1976
40,Fabulous Glamorous Freaky,"Ok this place reminds me of an old horror film...like as soon as I turn away they will move! Just Amazing work. They are so authentic and lifelike that I imagine standing there meeting my favorite stars.There are places to eat all around and since it does not take long to see the whole place, there is time to do something else.I was glad I had warm sweater and hand warmers. It was cold inside, so be prepared.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MSReviewer007
50,Had a great time here,"When I entered, I was really unsure of how to pose with these wax statues. But slowly I started enjoying copying these hand gestures and had some serious fun doing some. Must visit everyone. Doesn’t matter if you know all the stars here or not..just pose and click pictures!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nityaraghu
40,A great highlight to the boulevard!,Really enjoyed Madame Tussauds - lots of photo opportunities with the stars! A fun experience and works of art.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M1604RUpaular
50,Lots of fun!,This wax museum was a lot of fun- very realistic. I liked how some of the figures were standing in the middle of the room with you - so lifelike! My only criticism would be the marquee outside portraying certain celebrities whose figures were not inside as being remodeled,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/saphireblack
50,Perfect!!,"This place is busy, busy, busy, but if you pace yourself, sometimes you can do a whole photo shoot with your favorite wax figure.It's included; for now with the LA Go Card! Act fast, a lot of businesses are bailing on the LA Go Card, we had to pay for some attractions because they refused to accept the card.The A/C in this building is AMAZING!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LynNetterBug
30,So-so,"This place was okay, but WAY overpriced. It was crowded with rowdy teens who were rude and annoying. Some of the wax figures were impressive, most left a lot up be desired. At the end, the hard sell in, not one, but TWO souvenir shops was off-putting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/monab326
50,All Hollywood stars at a single place,"Do you wish to meet your hollywood star and take a picture with them. Madame Tussauds can help you achieve that, if not with real star but with their wax statue.Worth visit while you are at LA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Satish_Kolla
50,fun visit,line to enter wasn't bad and moved fast and to my surprise it was not crowded at all and was comfortabley spaced for plenty of pictures. there's a lot more figures than i thought and the selection and organization in the levels was nice. does take time to thoroughly view everyone so you dont have to rush. loved the few props set up to take pictures with. the figures are actually really realistic looking! cant comment on pricing since i got in with the go city pass,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/486ananditap
30,Worth a visit,"If this is your first time visiting a Madame Tussaud’s definitely worth the visit. As expected the museum is quite a bit smaller than the one in London but you get the idea pretty quick. Some of the models look incredibly real, while sone not so much. Beware the crowds and the long lineups. A better option would be to buy tickets online for admission after 5 pm. There will be less crowds and you save almost 50%. Great option!Adult tickets for walk in are 30.95 USD.... I would say definitely not worth it",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Traveler2009
40,LA Tour,"Madame Tusads, If you want to spend some time with your Hollywood star this is the best place. Very well maintained and not over crowded. If you want to see Bollywood stars then this place is not for you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Scenic746414
50,Funny,Brilliant place the exhibits are really good and having your photo with with is really good and really funny,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paul67utb
50,Great selection of classic stars,"If you think a wax museum is just for kids you are wrong as you are never too old to visit Madame Tussauds. I love that they had a great collection of classic Hollywood stars at this place such as for instance Vivien Leigh & Clark Gable, (Gone with the wind), Elizabeth Taylor (Cleopatra), Audrey Hepburn, Ingrid Bergman, Marilyn Monroe, James Dean, Katharine Hepburn and Bette Davis. Since we'll never get to meet these stars in real life it is fun to ""meet"" them at this museum. The wax figures also looked more life like than I had expected.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/268karins
40,OK to kill 1-2 hours,Hardcore movie fans will enjoy this place.You can do more in the area so your options are open to either spend more time here or walk to other attractions nearby.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CSC1973
50,Fun place to get great pics!,"This is a fund place on Hollywood Blvd to get some great pics of celebrities(wax, not real). Great way to spend an hour! :).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/413brandit
40,Better than expected,"I'm not a Star Watcher, but my teen wanted to visit. Expected an outdated collection but was pleasantly surprised with modern stars next to classic 1920s & 30s stars. The artwork of the wax figures themselves was amazing and worth seeing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WonderingMomma
50,Super cool!,"This was a super cool experience! Some of them look so real it's freaky. haha Poor Jennifer Lopez though, her's was really bad :( Took some of our best pictures here! It's a must see if you're doing Hollywood..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rachele279
40,Visited only because it was included in our Go Card L.A. pass and am glad we did.,We purchased a Go Card L.A. which included admission to the wax museum. We travelled as a family with two teenage boys and really enjoyed the visit but do not think it is worth the window ticket price.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ljd4
50,Interesting place to visit,"Situated close to the TCL Theatre on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and near the start route for HOHO, Madame Tussauds Hollywood is very different where you can take pictures with your favorite Hollywood celebrities. It is across 3 levels and needs about 90 to 120 minutes to see all the was statues.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VibhuBansal
50,MUST VISIT THIS SEASON!,"I always recommend Madame Tussauds Hollywood to visitors, but for the Holiday Season 2017, I consider it a MUST VISIT, even for guests who have visited before. The company continues to excel at providing an unforgettable fun experience for all ages, and the people really do treat you ads guests there.There are lots of photo ops to record your memories, and the staff genuinely enjoy making people happy to be there. For this holiday season, they have added a feature pop up shop called Christmas in Hollywood, with a whole range of ornaments that are not sold anywhere else in Southern California. They personalize the ornaments for free, so you are giving a gift that people will cherish forever.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/86michealb
40,This is your only chance to meet the stars!!,"We quite enjoyed going around seeing the wax models of the famous stars. Its quite small compare to Madam Tussauds in London. We were finished in about an hour and we took our time too. Some of the figures were really good, some didn't really look like who they were supposed to be. We enjoyed it but was not worth the entrance fee.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NucciaNice
50,Worth a visit!,"This Museum is far better than the original Wax Museum. We found this quite enjoyable, and happily took photos with many of the celebrities.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TipihaereNZ
50,"World famous and historic wax museum, probably the better one to see in L.A.","First of all, they have a very reasonable price if you go there after 5:00 and buy your ticket online. I was entertaining a friend from another country who wanted to go to the wax museum along with the Chinese theatre and Hollywood in general. This wax museum has some very real looking figures, which is a little freaky. You also learn who Madame Tussaud was and how they make the figures, from start to finish. Given that we got the evening price of $20 we felt we got our money's worth.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S5357RZlauram
50,Super realistic,"Madame Tussauds Hollywood has some amazingly realistic wax figures, i would touch some of them before i would stand next to them to take a photo - I was terrified that they were real.I recommend walking down the street and waiting for someone to give you a leaflet with a voucher (we got a buy one get one free offer). I also recommend looking on Groupon. There is a gift shop on the way out however it is expensive and there is a souvenir bargain shop just outside.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmyLouLouO
40,Pretty cool,"The wax figures were super cool, make sure you buy a GO PASS if you plan on going to multiple attractions, saves you some money if you plan on going to a bunch of attractions like this.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vacationjunkie2387
40,Good place to see wax figures of your favourite celebrities,Madam Tussauds is a must if at least once. Families with children will enjoy this as the kids can make pretend.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/941selenam
50,So Cool!!!,I have been wanting to visit a wax museum for the longest time and decided to come here while on a visit to L.A this is located on the walk of fame by the Chinese Theater so its perfect if you are in the area. I purchased the tickets online and I think you can get like $6 off. Overall so worth it the wax figures were incredible they looked so real! I loved this place will visit the one in Vegas when I travel there!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/404gretell
40,Best Combined with a Visit to Chinese Theater,"So here’s the deal: if you take visitors to see the foot and hand prints at the Chinese Theater, there’s not a whole lot else to do after paying for expensive parking in the area. And how much time can you spend looking at the movie star prints now that they seem to have them totally blocked off from the public? It may be a temporary thing, but at least on my visit in late October, all we could do was to peek over the barrier to see the prints closest to the barrier.So this is a review of Madame Tussaud’s Hollywood, but I wanted to give a recommendation of Madame as an add-on to any visit to the Chinese Theater which is next door. It was surprisingly pricy for two tickets, but I must say that my out of town visitor and I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The figures, for the most part, are quite life-like and they do represent a large variety of Hollywood personalities. The best part is that you can pose with the figures for wonderful photos, and there were a few occasions where props were available to make the photos a lot of fun. Be aware that there are a few places in the building where the staff will take photos of you, some of which are against a green screen with elaborate scenes superimposed (OK, photo shopped) in the background. These for profit photos are reminiscent of the constant photo huckstering on cruise ships – I thought the price of entrance was enough without the added costs.Toward the end of the visit, there is about a 20 minute film which evokes earthquakes, along with some fun effects such as wind blown at you, a bit of water in your face, etc. That film was very well made and the earthquake effects were terrific. Don’t leave without seeing it!At the end of the exhibits, there is a little gift shop. We did not buy anything (luckily), because as one leaves that little gift shop, you are ushered in a large gift shop with items all priced at $5, and some of those same items had been found in the smaller gift shop at higher prices! My out of town visitor was delighted with the $5 prices and bought a ton of kitsch to take home.So in summary, Madame is an excellent add-on to any visit to Hollywood and Highland.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FrequentTraveller034
50,Better than I expected,I really didn't expect much but was very impressed with all of the wax figures. I would recommend Madame Tussauds to anyone visiting Hollywood.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/markkR8756UI
40,Cool visit,Awesome attraction. Never fails me. Frequently updated with new figures and lovely effects. It's fun for all.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mostafamaher
40,Nice way to spend the afternoon,We took our German exchange student here and it was a fun afternoon of silly photo taking and lots of giggling. Some of the statues are amazing while others are... strange.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lauriepaz
40,Nice Play on the Blvd,The wife loves old Hollywood so we decided to check out the wax museum. Of course before going in you have to do the obligatory pictures.The wax figures were great. Between the newer stars and older ones the wife and me were thoroughly entertained.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/timothysT5325EI
50,Fantastic Fabulous and Freaky,"Man oh Man was this place awesome.My first trip to a Wax Museum and I was amazed.The lifelike models of artists both film and radio were awesome.I would highly recommend this tour to all walks of life, the young and old alike will enjoy this place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Eddy2764
40,Money well spent,"While we walked down Hollywood Blvd we saw marketing for 50% off tickets from a street vendor, so I'm not sure if we overpaid. Either way, we had a good time taking selfies with famous wax people; they look so real in pics. I enjoyed how they have props taking more realistic pics with many of the wax people, and the option to go home with your own wax hand.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shernandez710
40,Great Place To Visit and Act Youself,We were not planning to go to the museum but glad we did.They network with the Starline tours and offer a discount.They had several floors of current figures.Many were set up so you could pose as the actors in various scenes which was a great idea and made it quite a fun experience.The family is still laughing at some of these pictures. For instance the bike scene in ET. You can be the boy riding the bike.'Looks like they are improving the techniques but they were always very good to start with. Not sure they're not just wax anymore.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/geraldm924
50,Best wax museum in Hollywood,This is the better wax museum. Don't go to the other one. We got 50 percent off coupons and it was worth it. Figured were great and set up was fun a spacious .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BoniG77
30,Selfie Spot Along the Walk,"I have stopped by the M.T.'s in Vegas, so I knew what to expect. However, the gf wanted to stop by this place just once. As it was along the ""walk"" and we had it included with our Go L.A. Card, we stopped by versus paying the $31.00 each.I am not sure how many total wax sculptures there were along the three floors, but it was a lot from all kinds of genres. I personally through the one in Vegas had more, but it could be that location just was a smaller square footage to make it look that way. They also had a Marvel Comics movie, where L.A. had once about an earthquake movie in 4D with the wind/water experience.The place is laid out well, and there is no shortage of popular and old timer celebrities for you selfie picture opportunities, which many seem to be taking advantage of. If you have the city pass or alike with this included, it is a good time waster that will give you an hour or so of pictures for your collection. I do not know that I would make a special trip for the $31.00 each IMHO.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/runaway2travel
50,Fun family visit,"My 11 year old daughter was desperate to go and we had a couple of hours to kill before heading to the airport so came here. I booked online and saved a few dollars, then used a mobile ticket to enter. The kids had a ball and got photos with everyone! We also got wax hands done for both kids which we carefully carried back on the flight to to New Zealand! Next time London. :o)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sellarz
50,Kool,This place was super kool. They have some of everybody and the look so real.. you can even make a wax of your own hand. You can take plenty of pictures.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/836latoyam
40,Tons of FUN!,Lots to see and experience - Loved it and would do it again! Just the massive King Kong in the entryway was a blast!!! Everything was so realistic and impressive - a must experience!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dagoboi
40,Something fun when you're traveling in LA,"It was pretty good. I think I might have been a little spoiled by the time I got there and wanted to have more interactive options, but I got to take a lot of selfies with the figures and that's always fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/verniceb2018
40,What fun at madame tussauds Wax Museum,"This place was really a fun experience. My son and daughter in law live in LA and made the arrangements. I'm so glad they did. The wax figures are really life like.and certainly look like the real thing. Interesting and almost ""creepy"" :-)It is a great photo opportunity and we had a great time taking the pictures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BobbieW229
40,Great Photo Opportunities,The wax statues make for great photo opportunities! The wax statues are quite the work of art and very life-like. The museum is definitely worth the time to check it out.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lisarae68
50,fame!,"If you wanna feel like famous... I mean being famous by being with famous, this place will be great for you :) I really liked!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/795tu_eu
50,Photos,Really large and good collection of spectacular persons. We took a deal to go also to the next door Dungeon with only small addition to the price. I recommend that you go to see these celebrities as they are so alive looking!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JokkeP5
40,Fun place to visit,Enjoyed going through and seeing all the celebrities. It was a great picture taking place. The 4D movie was good too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cclakeman
40,Very nice...,"It was pricey and I thought this very Madame Tussauds would be a special one since it is in Hollywood and not any other , didn't find anything so special about it....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Malnaser
50,A must see,Don't miss a visit if you are in the area. Excellent photo opportunity with the figures which are so lifelike. Some of the other bus tours will give out free tickets after there tours,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bundyjames
50,Very Cool! Like walking into a room full of celebs,"When I got off the elevator it was very strange at first because some of the wax figures look so real and so current! It was really cool to be able to pose with them for selfies. My favorite, was Betty White. It looks EXACTLY like her. It’s a very cheesy touristy thing to do but really is a must see if you’re in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RockyMntnGirlFrom216
50,Qick Visit,Got a free visit when we did the bus tour so visited on our return. It was OK but not all the waxworks were labelled so didn't know who one or two of them were. Maybe wouldn't have gone if it didn't come free with the bus tour though.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/36Debbie
20,Didn't't expect much and was still disappointed,"this is not an attraction we would have sought out but we were given ""free"" access as we had purchased a tour bus excursion. So off we went for what proved to be a lacklustre 30 minutes of my life i will never get back. Please do not spend $35 per person to stare and wonder if Steve McQueen really had such a poor hair cut or whether Will Smith's ears really stick out that far?. what a let down.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cestrian14
50,Have to check it out,I was not expecting that much when we went into this. We got admission for free because we brought a 3 day hop on/hop off bus pass.Was i surprised with the place. I think it is definitely worth going to. The icing on the cake was the 4d cinema at the end - great thing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/glencampbell112
30,ANYTHING FOR SELENAS,"it was okay, I honestly only went to see the Selena wax figure which BTW was amazing, some of the others could have been better.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/monicarenee1206
40,Many Superstars,I've been to a few Madame Tussaud's museums around the world. This museum at Hollywood is a better one. It include a 4D movie show.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlanChua33
40,Great visit in the evening,We went at 6 pm and it was quiet. Great selection of waxworks and because of the time and how quiet it was we got uninterrupted viewing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I157DBstevet
40,Great walking amongst the Stars,Enjoyed the experience walking amongst some of the stars & how lifelike they are & some had opportunity of photo op with costume like ET,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MDickie
50,Cheesy fun,"This was a cheesy thing to do but my husband and daughter really enjoyed it. We have visited many wax museums and Madame Tussauds is the best -- but the Hollywood location is the absolute best (we've been to Madame Tussauds in Washington DC and Vegas). The figures look very realistic and there are lots of props to use to pose with and take pictures with the figures. We got a coupon from some guy on the street and saved a lot on admission -- actually the prices came out to about $20 pp and in DC we paid $30. If you like movies and celebs, this is a fun thing to do!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sandraaV6468CL
20,I wouldn't bother...,I don't normally write poor reviews.. I try to find something positive to say about everywhere I go... so the positive.. I had a free ticket to go with my bus tour.If you are paying to enter as an adult you are looking at $30 to enter and look at wax models of famous people. Which is bit steep especially as they'll try and sting you for photos as you go around.Highlights: the Marvel section and the master chief.The rest just a little creepy...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christophercL3377CG
30,Wouldn't recommend alone,Super realistic to the point that I was a little scared to go up to some of them. Sometime the music and voice recordings could be a little to much and I wouldn't recommend going alone it can be a little boring when there's no one to take a nice picture for you. Overall if I had the option to go again I wouldn't unless I had a friend with me.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrittanyG1168
50,Fun!,"After almost a week in LA, my kids wanted to see a celebrity. I thought we saw Patrick Stewart in Venice (probably not him) and Justin Bieber in Beverly Hills, but they were skeptical. So I figured the second best thing was Madame Tussaud's. Luckily they have one in Hollywood.We could not have been more pleased. The exhibits are top notch, the personnel are great (kudos to Pete the manager, who explained to my 11 year old the history of Madame Tussaud's), and the video shows are very interesting.I was initially a little concerned about the area. It is right on one of the more crowded streets in Hollywood, chock full of all kinds of characters, but Pete seems to run a tight ship, and kept the street characters at a safe distance from the entrance, especially the costumed people trying to get cash for getting photos with them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/twnyc
50,Wax at it's best,Madame Tussauds is the very best wax museum by far. They all look EXTREMELY real even up close and most pose for the figure.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1DR
40,yeah its kool,if u want pics of u and some celebs come here they have some well known ones my fav was ET cause u can ride the bike with him in the front all good for selfies and on the bottom floor they hav a 4 d movie you can watch also yeah its kool place to visit,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Marunui187
50,VERY FUN PLACE !!,"I took 2 nine year olds to the museum and they had a great time. This place lets you get up close to the figures which makes it quite easy to get photos. They even have some props to put on to go with the figure. One floor is dedicated to musical celebrities and they play their music. There are actors, presidents and sports legends. Definitely check this place out!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gb9236080
40,SO FUN!,The wax figures were so realistic that you had to look twice and make sure. Great exhibit of all the current and old celebrities. They take photos of you as soon as you come in so be prepared to pose!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barbaraq866
50,Had never been before except the week before in Las VEGAS,Traveled from Vegas and saw the museum there. It was fun. Note very big. People are really realistic. Came to hollywood and did it again and they are completely different from one another. It was a fun experience,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kimloehr
50,Great Sculptures of many Hollywood Persons,Love the museum. You can see many of the Hollywood actors and actresses here. Its a must go if you are in the Hollywood or Los Angeles area. Love it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnnybaca02
50,So much fun!,"My son asked to visit the wax museum and Madam Tussauds was the best option. I purchased tickets online at a discounted rate, which was awesome! Purchased our tickets and was able to walk right in. The wax figures were so amazingly done. My son thoroughly enjoyed himself taking photos with almost all of the figures. It was really cool that some of the figures had props to use, trust me, my son loved that added feature. This was a great mother and son activity as I laughed endlessly at how much fun he had. Great attraction!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rodjohn
50,Family fun,We had not planned to visit the wax museum as it was a little pricey. However we were handed 50% off coupons while on the street outside. So we decided to go in. Our 12 year old LOVED it. Especially getting to wear different costumes and interact with the figures. We had so much fun. We were probably inside for close to 2 hours ( including the 4D film ) We would definitely go back!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kjwall
40,Fun LifeLike,Had a fun time seeing all of the wax figures in the museum. They are so very lifelike. Highly recommend this tour when visiting the Hollywood LA area. Lots of photo opportunities and costumes with various exhibits that you can dress up to stand next to your favorite wax character.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TrailBlazers04
50,Fantastic and interesting place!,You can see here figures of lots of interesting people and dress yourself - there are fancy dresses and subjects. Fantastic and not expensive !,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/674tatianak
50,Mingling with the Stars,"Had some time to kill. My Daughter and I decided to check it out. Was not disappointed. Been in a couple of these wax type museums all over the world. The figures were so life like that my daughter was afraid to sit next to Simon Cowell. She thought that it was real. The figures were well placed, lots of room and amazed at the fact that a lot of the figures were interactive and you could touch them (except for the face). Took home some great photos and fun photos taken by the staff. Highly recommend it",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/6422016
40,Great time spent with the family!,"Spent a couple hours here while on vacation in Los Angeles from Canada.The family had a blast, taking photos with all the stars, very well laid out, not too busy and perfect location!Definitely give it a visit if in the area, passes some time while on the Hollywood strip!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Matthew_613
50,Wonderful,We loved very much and kids liked it as well. The wax work was done top notch.We went to three others down the street but this was by far worth a return many times .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/13521F2
40,"I mean, it's the celebrities you hope to see on the street, but like in your face!","A bit cheesy, but fun for what the experience is!

50,wax museum,"this place was so good! the wax figures look so real and the creators of the place made taking pictures fun. some figures had props to go with them to make you a part of their story. a little movie (4D) is played for you and that was really fun. highly recommend going. overall, the figures were done really well",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Saskville
50,Great wax museum,"We bought a combination ticket from Starline tours which included the stars' homes and tour as well as admission to Madame Toussands--we're glad we did! So much to see (really well done). We also enjoyed the ""wax facts"" that were posted on the wall as well as the trivia. So interesting and wonderful to go through!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scubamex
50,Amazing!,"I wanted to go to the musuem because of Selena Quintinia. But was overjoyed when I got in. I love Scarlett and Rhett Butler. Ingrid Bergman from Casablanca. But when I saw Charleton Heston as Moses and Jimmy Stewart as George Bailey. I was overjoyed. I love how it caters to all types. The newbies, but the classics..Well worth the money. I just wished I went slower and enjoyed more time ..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/juliianne

It took us about 4 hours to cover the entire exhibit because we had so much fun. It shouldn't have taken so long but waiting for other people to take pictures or pass by so that you could take a picture added on to the time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kendita
30,Madame Tussauds Hollywood,"This museum was not as good as the Madame Tussauds in New York. It only took us less than an hour to go through it, and we had taken pictures with practically EVERY SINGLE wax figure. Highlights were: Ryan Reynolds, Zach Ephron, all the Marvel characters, Taylor Swift, Kylie Jenner (I have teenage daughters...), Alfred Hitchcock and his shower (we had just came from The Universal Studios tour the day before and I had to explain to the young'uns about Psycho), and a few old Hollywood figures.If you have an hour to kill and a few dollars to spend, go for it. If you want to save your money and you're going to NYC in the future, go to that one instead.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/caliprincess88
50,Loved it. One of my fav spots,"Yes, if you are in LA you must go here. I get some great pics with some of my fav stars. Michael Jackson, Jamie Foxx, Marilyn Monroe, Kylie Jenner, Snoop Dogg, Barack Obama and a few other celbs. Great place to visit. I recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/738shamils
40,"Well set out, wax figures are quite well done",The whole family enjoyed this attraction. The figures ranged in age enough that we all found some that we really enjoyed seeing. Most of them we pretty good but a couple were not so realistic. The layout was great there's plenty of room to see each one and get photos.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peewee1010
50,Great Fun,"I obtained entry thru the go LA card and had a terrific experience posing with the different wax Celebs and the different displays. Admittedly, some of them were a little off, but must were eerily spot on, it's definitely a must see.Enjoy it",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YoYoBumchuck
50,Fun place to visit,My kids had a lot of fun using the dress up items they had available and taking photos of the wax figures. It was a fun hour to spend.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/heatherhJ3541NI
30,London is Better,We bought a hop on hop off sightseeing bus ticket with discounted entry to the wax museum included. It was o.k. but the one in London is much bigger and so much better. Having been there a few times this was a bit disappointing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tussox
50,"Really fun, go early","I noticed the cost here says $24.99 for advance purchase but we paid on the day of, in person and it cost a little over $30 with taxes.Anyways besides here, I've been to the Madame Tussaud's in Niagara Falls. That one was much more extensive with more figures and took us 2 hours to get through. Haven't been to the NYC one yet. This one had more Hollywood celebrities that are currently popular but it also had a lot of movie stars from yester-year like Paul Newman who I only know from dressing bottles at the supermarket. I mostly came to see Selena's wax figure as I'm a huge fan. The ""Selena"" gift shop t-shirts cost $20/each by the way.I recommend going when they open as less people are in there and it's easier to take pictures. After 12:30pm, more people start filling up the place and you have to wait to take pictures with lots of the figures (especially the figures with props like Sandy from Grease and Oscar de la Hoya).There is a parking garage directly below the museum, you enter along the side street as an FYI. They charge between $10-15 for daily parking so if you want parking in the area, I recommend there as it was an easy 5 minutes waiting to get our car back from the valet.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JacquelineJ413
50,Loved it,"As a movie and pop culture fan, I loved the museum even though it's not that big. The wax figures were spot on and flash photography is allowed. You can even touch the statues and you're provided with props to bring originality to the pictures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/770bachirh
30,not so good,"Some figures looking like other people, hahaha. The was Beyonce and we where sure it was Shakira. I am sorry, this is very funny, but they have to take another specialist to make a good copy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/577jannat
50,Fun place to visit,Spent a couple of hours here viewing the wax figures. They look so real and you can take pictures of the figures and get close to them. I highly recommend that you buy your tickets online and ahead of time before you go and visit the museum to avoid the wait.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lisamR8298US
50,Excellent visit to Madame Tussauds,This was our first visit to Madame Tussauds and it was super fantastic. We had so much fun interacting with the wax figures. Great photo opportunity and loved it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/debrabR8909NE
50,Strike a pose!,So much fun to see the different stars and get a feel for what they look like up close! A great place to slow down and enjoy family time!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AHouska
50,Creepy yet so cool,"Wax figures are overall kinda creepy yet fascinating all the same time. They look so real!! From Kyle Jenner to Audrey Hepburn and Zach Effron to John Wayne, this place has an amazing display of who's who through the decades. There are 3 floors but it goes quickly. Some figures are simply standing there Red Carpet ready, while others are themed based on their roles. We had tons of fun being silly and posing for pics. This place is also included in the LA Unlimited Go Pass--see my review on that separately.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GasolineGypsy
50,Great Experience with the Famous!,Spent an enjoyable couple of hours here and was delighted with the friendly staff and set up. Starting at the upper level we worked our way down and navigation was easy with lots of opportunities for photos with numerous props provided. Some famous people are quite small! Well with the visit for us on the Go City Los Angeles Card.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/patrickm62nov
40,expensive for what you get but was fun to see!,"We paid full price for this then found out at most hotels they have coupons in the flyers they hand out 8 dollars off or some were have price. I am really not into this type of stuff but my he had a good time even though there were long lines out side in side was fine for taking pictures. Most people were very respectful and everyone took their turn. I would not do it again but it was well worth it for a one time visit. they have stairs or elevators so easy for everyone to get around. You come out of the $5 store which was another money grab, be prepared everyday the stuff is $5 not $10 as they would have you believe happy travels. and remember if your not sure if you want to do it just jump in!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/justjumpin
40,Good experience!,"I have been into MT in London, Sydney and Singapore and really enjoyed it! This MT was just as cool and awesome except for the people out the front asking for tips for photos. Metro station really close too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brittanya257
50,Just fun...,I had never been to a wax museum before. My family had a blast. The life like figures are incredible. 3 floors of fun. Everything from movies to music to sports. I'll definitely do it again in another city.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CharlesT223
50,Very enjoyable!,"I'm very glad i decided to visit! My family and I had so much fun. Only thing that needs to be improved is the hand wax station near the end of the exhibit, long wait! Needs two stations to make line move faster. A lot of congestion at that point.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jason40westmain
50,So much fun!!,"My husband and I visited here and we had a total blast. There was so much to see. We had never been to a wax museum so this was a treat. The figures are so life like. You save money by purchasing online on the website. Madame Tussaud's does have its own parking garage offering valet parking at $15 but we self parked off of Hollywood and Highland Center and paid $1 per 15 minutes (maximum of $15). We stayed 2 hours which was $8. You actually could park here and do the Hollywood Walk of Fame, Grauman's Chinese Theater, other attractions, and shopping.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cenalestravel
50,Almost Human..,"At first I was kind of weary, but when I got in and sat besides Simon Cowell.....was weird, I felt almost like he was ""there"". Very nice work, veru nice exhibit. o much fun to use the provided gadgets for selfies.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T1883VQjoses
50,Better Than Expected!,"I know Madame Tussauds is kind of the ultimate ""tourist"" stop, but it really is well worth the visit. We did it because it was the tourist thing to do, but we actually enjoyed it much more than we expected. I especially appreciate that you can touch the figures which makes posing for pictures a lot more fun. We got a kick out of trying to find interesting ways to pose with the celebs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PowerTrippersTravel
50,Much Better Than Expected!,"Our grandsons, (14 & 17) requested a trip to Madame Tussauds Wax Museum when they visited us in July. My husband & I had been to one of their exhibits and weren't really sure that they would enjoy it. But the changes they have made really enhanced our experience. The wax figures of famous Hollywood Stars are spread throughout many large rooms in different poses. Some are standing in the middle of the room while others are posed with furniture and props. What made the adventure so much fun was that costumes and props were provided with the figures, so the attendees could pose with the figures for pictures. We all got into it and dressed the part to dramatically pose with the scene. There are explanations of the careers of each star, but the best part of the experience was to see yourself in close proximity of the figure. So if you go, take a camera and be prepared to wear the Italian Stallion robe and boxing gloves with Rocky Balboa, or the Bowler Hat and Cane with Charlie Chaplin. That's where the excitement lays!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HLII
50,Fun for the whole family,My girls had a blast! Smaller than other locations but fun none the less. The 3 floors had a lot of characters that they can related too. They offered a military discount which was great. We spent about 2 hours here. Well worth it! My only con.... ladies in the gift shop weren't friendly or helpful so it was confusing getting out of the building.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/roxanng659
40,Surprisingly fun for the whole family,I had low expectations for this visit. My testy mother in law was complaining before we arrived. Add two teenager girls and two tween boys and my anticipation was nonstop complaining. But madam tussauds was surprisingly very fun. The fax figures were so real I kept checking to make sure a real celebrity wasn't playing a trick. There were props in every room to make posing with the figures even more fun. The kids got really into it with each pose more elaborate and hilarious than the last. With three floors of figures we have tons of pictures. You can touch the figures anywhere but the hair and face so get creative and have fun. The marvel movie at the end was cute but a little lame. Be prepared to get wet if you view it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/359micheller
40,"Great time ""meeting"" the stars!",Loved walking around & seeing how lifelike the statues were. Fun photos shoots with each other. Reading the history of 'the people' displayed was intersting.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnneElisabeth
50,Great fun,My husband and I bought tickets online before going to LA and thought of this as another thing on our list. Boy were we surprised! We are both kind of shy but the feel of this place and the props had us putting on hats and jackets and even a straight jacket! We just got home yesterday and spent the night laughing at our pics. When we ordered online we spent a little more for a wax hand and souvenir photo. Soooo much fun and so with it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/staceydimattia
50,Worth it,Step into famous fun and meet your favorite celebrities at Madame Tussauds. to rub shoulders with the stars at Hollywood wax attraction.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aakagarw
50,We have fun,"I've been in Madame Tussauds London, but this is different not better it's same, ticket prices is reasonable if you're with your family, i will advice you to get the Ultimate Experience Ticket, the package comes with fast track pass, Souvenir photo, Guidebook, and wax hand. We have great time and enjoy, if you visiting L.A you must visit Madame Tussauds Hollywood",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alaa_AbdulWahab
30,Bit of a laugh,I had been here before with my daughter on her 16th and decided to repeat the ritual for my son. It is expensive for what it is but we did have a laugh posing with a few of the celebrities. You can be in and out in about 45 minutes. It was fine with just two of us but if you were a party of 4 or more it gets very expensive quickly.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nebuliza
10,Huge Disappointment,"We've been to the London headquarters of this institution so we were excited to visit our local version.Wow, were we let down. It's as if they had no money and no imagination when putting together this shoddy version of the original.Simply put, there is no reason in the world to visit this tourist trap when there are so many better choices to do in LA.We were finished in 30 minutes and all agreed one visit was one too many.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TRVLtruth
50,Great time for all ages,We are a mixed age group and there were many other mixed age groups. Had a great time posing and taking pics. I was here about 5 years ago....they have some of the same figures but many new ones. Fun time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/connief517
40,see the stars up close,"Very good museum,we went early morning and there was hardly anyone else there so we had plenty of time we each model taking photographs.Well worth a visit,but get a half price ticket voucherwhich are given out for free along Hollywood Boulevard",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/835allans
40,Pretty Impressive !,"We skipped the Madame Tussauds at Vegas but decided to visit the stars while in LA. Must admit was a good decision.We went with our 2 yr old & he was most excited around the MJ statue with the blazing lights & hip hop music. Danced and hopped to his heart's content !With a happy kid in tow , we had a great time too. Clicked lots of pictures and the props enhanced our experience!😎 We were there on a Saturday & expected huge crowds but the Musuem is spread over 3 floors which distributes the guests evenly !Do the Wax Musuem first and take a stroll later at the Walk of Fame , Dolby Theatre etc once the harsh sunlight gets mild in summer. I plan to do their other museums at NYC & London too !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tinss
50,Rub shoulders with celebrities ..... Lol,A great way to spend time with family and friends. Life like wax figures allow you to avoid paparazzi's and hang out with your favorite celebrities.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KetanDeshpandeMN
50,Great fun!,"We enjoyed seeing the figures, posing with them and taking pictures. We were amazed at the size of the celebrities! So lifelike!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/725kristau
30,Tussauds,Best way to save money is do the Starlite Hop on Hop Off pass. We were offered the wax museum for $5 instead of $30 u pay at the door. Its good. Not as good as London. The 4D film is the best part,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GieS418
50,Really Good,Thoroughly enjoyable & great fun for all the family. Snap yourself with the rich and famous & also legends from the Wild West movies. Great seeing a section/theme of Stark Industries of Iron Man/Captain America etc. The 3D 15minute movie worth a watch - special effects great.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/charles_mellor
30,Afternoon fun in Hollywood,Enjoyed walking around this museum and seeing the figures. Took lots of funny pictures with the figures. Laughed alot. Even taking tons of pictures only took about an hour to complete the tour.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/southerngal2015
40,Fun to pose with and my kids loved it,"We last visited this Madame Tussauds back in 2009, and my kids still love looking at pictures, so this was a must do for them on our latest trip. We were unable to find a deal we were happy with, but we used a coupon from a worker outside for a much better deal than on the website. Some of the figures are more realistic than others, but we especially loved all of the props to enhance our picture taking. Our entire family had a good time, and we enjoyed the 3d movie about the Avengers also.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amyw2012
40,"Fun, you might give it a try","It was a lot of fun, although I did expect a larger collection. Haven't been to any other Madame T museums, so I can't really rate how is this one in comparison when it comes to the size of the collection. The wax figures are pretty impressive, very life-like and detailed. I found the tickets a bit too pricey. The museum is located at Hollywood Blvd, you can't really miss it. It's ok to take photos at the museum. Might give it a try once you're in Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/627justynap
30,Small,"This one is a lot smallr than others we have visited in the US.It was quiet and you could go at your own pace but didn't take very long to get around at all..Glad we booked in advance and got a good deal, would not have been happy to have paid price on the door.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M0nkey01
40,Best of the Hollywood museums - lots of fun for kids,"Not only were figures of my kids' favorite celebrities on display, but they enjoyed posing with each and every(!) wax figure at this museum. The layout of this museum is well thought out, making it easy for everyone to get their pictures and not miss any displays. Many displays had scenery and/or props to make the photo ops even more fun.I would recommend buying your tickets online in advance, since they are much cheaper that way. I wish I had done that. (I'm sure a tour package is a better deal than buying at the door, too.) Also beware that the VIP pass for admission to three museums is NOT for this wax museum. That includes admission to the Hollywood Wax Museum, which is different.Probably my biggest complaint is that the gift shop is small. But if you're like my family, you walk out with scores of pictures to enjoy anyway.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Anita8IceCream
40,A fun place to visit,This was a place we went to kill time before heading to the airport. We had a fun time in the end. The figures were pretty cool and most were lifelike. They even had costumes you could put on and get into character. We had alot of laughs dressing up.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/madamshalet
50,So real,My son and I had a blast posing with the wax figures. They are so life like. I also loved the figure and history of Madam T.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/debsW3024QA
40,Celebrities immortalised in incredible detail - Check out my pics,We received tickets as part of a tour my wife took. Its not normally something I would do but it was quite enjoyable walking the 3 floors and the detail is spot on.An easy way to pass an hour in downtown Hollywood.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/949tg
40,good visit,"we have visitied most Madams Tussauds across the globe and yet this was our third time visiting and each time it is still interesting, they keep changing the exhibits and making it more appealing each time, took lots of photos, it was busy but not crowded, parking is nearby just be prepared to pay for it",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mulgrew
40,Better than expected,"I'm not into pop culture so I was expecting the worst... but I have to say it was fun seeing the ""waxed"" stars. Not necessary a must see but it was fun. Also the extra 4D movie at the end was a bonus.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Xalandri1
50,A blast,"We had a blast at Madame Tussauds! There are three levels that you can walk through with very realistic wax models of famous celebrities from singers to actors and directors to sports stars.We went in not expecting much but were pleasantly surprised with the layout, the variety of celebrities and some were interactive with costumes for photos. Photos and videos are allowed and you are allowed to touch them but not the head or hair.A fun 4D Marvel movie at the end and cute gift shop. Lots of fun for all ages! Highly recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/504becj
40,Play with the stars of Hollywood!,"On a recent visit to Los Angeles, doing the Hollywood walk of Fame and visiting Madame Tussauds was a given. Our group of 5 had a great deal of fun posing with the wax models of so many well known film stars. Some of the models are of film stars of a bygone era, while others were more up to date. We were hoping to see more of the popular artists but it is probably not possible to accommodate so many of the stars. Props were available e.g. hats and feather boas, to allow for fun poses. We were particularly impressed with how life-like some of the models were. On entering the museum, a group photo was taken which we were not obliged to buy. We were also told that the photos could be downloaded digitally after we had purchased a set of 5 printed photos. We have not yet attempted to retrieve them. Hope we don't have the same experience as Randy H. Definitely worth a visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/61RobertaW
50,Wax model fun!,"We got our tickets as complementary through a Warner Tour and a discount book from a hotel lobby.They do offer 50% off or buy one get one onsite.All kinds of celebrity photo opportunities. Loads of fun, nice gift shop too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JimDeBerry
50,Up Close and Personal.....kinda,"Our family, which includes a teenager, had a blast at Madam Tussaud's. They have a nice range of wax models that appeal to a wide range of the population from Jason Derulo to Judy Garland. You'll love getting your picture taken with the likes of John Travolta (Danny Zuko) and Katniss (hunger games). Great props are available to enhance your photo ops with the stars. Of course there are stops along the way where they take your pic with some of the props. You can buy two of them for $20, 3 for $25 or 4 for $40 plus the ability to see all your pics online. Money well spent! Will never forget it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlejandroRS1973
20,Bad experiance getting our paid for photos,We went to the museum and was given a good sales pitch for a photo package that could be downloaded digitally. We had six people traveling together from two states and two countries so getting digital images was the deal. After several attempts at retrieval we called the Museum and the contacted their subcontractor picsolve. After calling the museum back I received a copied email from museum to picsolve. I then tried again to retrieve and failed. Then I received my codes from picsolve of coarse different than printed on my receipt. The museum was cool>,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RandyH856
30,It's OK if you have an hour to spare.,This was more of a visit for my partner than myself.It's OK for a quick walk through and to take some stupid pics with stiff actors etc. (couldn't help think this would be a great place for Keanu Reeves to hang out in....I mean the actual guy. No ones stiffer on film than he is.......well maybe Hayden Christensen right?)Anyway we got a free ticket with some other purchase and that's really the only reason I went....I personally wouldn't have paid to visit.If you have run out of other things to do in the area or you have kids that might find this amusing then go for it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/281craigm
40,Madame Tussauds Hollywood,"We had a lot of fun visiting this wax museum. They had several places where you could put on an accessory and then make your picture with the ""star"". While it was fun, I felt there where not as many figures as I expected to see. Would have loved to see more than what was there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WorryWartPB
30,Quite Good,"There were some good waxworks in this one, but I expected a bit more considering that it was the Hollywood one. We finished the whole place in less an hour and were actually looking at the map, wondering if we had missed a level as it seemed quite short.However, if you are looking just to have something fun and a bit different to do whilst you are exploring Hollywood, it's a good experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jenj907
40,More Fun Than it Seemed,"After being a little let down by the kitchy tourist trap setting of Hollywood Blvd. we noticed Madame Tussauds and thought ""If we're ever going to visit a celebrity wax museum, why not do it in Hollywood!?"", and so we wandered in.At first glance we thought $30 was kind of expensive for what amounts to gawking at a couple of wax sculptures.We were pleasantly surprised. The experience was somehow actually very fun. The sculptures were actually quite nice and extremely lifelike (albeit a few uncanny valleys here and there). They really gave the sense of what it would be like to stand near some of the most iconic celebrities of the last century in their prime. The most interesting thing to me was the scale. You really got a sense of the height and body proportions of each celebrity which often can be surprising as we often only see these people on the big screen and don't always get a sense for scale.Even though they don't talk or move or anything, it still felt really fun to take goofy photos with our favorites and imagine what it would be like to meet them in person. The curated exhibit had great music, and background set design which helped enrich the experience.At the end of it we actually found it to be a satisfying and fun experience for the amount we paid to get in. Probably the most fun thing we did on Hollywood Blvd. Would recommend if you're interested in getting a feel for what it would be like to stand with the stars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chade64
40,"""Loved it""","We recently visited NY and we have always wanted to experience Madame Tussaud's Wax museum with my husband and I and 3 teenagers. While it was fairly pricey and the lines to get in were long, and the desk people slightly rude, we were pleasantly surprised at how much fun we had. The people look real, and it was super fun posing for pictures with them. I actually found myself wishing they had more people than they did, which is why I only gave them 4 stars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kriscat1
30,Madam Tussauds,The models were so spread out on different floors.Really not that impressed with it.It's ok the fill an hour or so in.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pclugston
50,Really Cool!!!,"We ended up getting tickets to the wax museum in a package with Skyline Tours for a little over $50 per person. We didn't plan on doing the wax museum, but it was such a good deal we decided to do both. We are so glad we did the LA tour and Madame Tussauds! The figures were so lifelike, even up close! For the first 10 min I was on high alert thinking one of the celebrities were going to be real and scare the crap out of me! This experience was so cool! We has so much fun taking pictures and goofing off!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/508marissar
50,Memories,It was enjoyable to see the life like statues of some of our favorite actors and actresses. Our teenagers enjoyed taking photos with the characters. It was a nice change up from everything else we have done.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ButchHogan
50,Quirky fun,"We stopped here on the City GO pass and spent a few hours viewing the wax stars. My kids & husband found humor in posing as wax people and scaring people as they walked by, otherwise this attraction could have been completed in an hour instead of 3. Great opportunities to dress up, pose and act silly. Many wax celebrities were scantily dressed so if that bothers you, you may want to avoid this attraction. My youngest was 10 and he enjoyed himself, though he didn't know who the majority of the celebrities were. kids much younger than 10 may not enjoy this attraction. This is definitely worth stopping by as part of the City Pass, otherwise, I'm not sure we would have found value in paying for this attraction. Check out the City Pass, it saved this family a lot of money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tanmansmom
40,Only had 45 minutes - but enjoyed it all,"Madame Tussauds is a great way to spend an hour or so. Many of the figures are so lifelike you will swear they should be breathing! There are also a couple of opportunities to have the staff take photos of you. Take the time to have this done, as the results can be hilarious! (TIP: There are people on the Walk of Fame handing out legitimate 50% off coupons to Madame Tussauds)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mrchanute
50,A must!,"The best thing about Hollywood blvd! I didn't expect much, honestly but we had so much fun! The wax figures are incredibly lifelike. It's a little creepy! And everyone who works there is fantastic! We had so much fun posing with the figures and interacting with the scenes. My only complaint is that it didn't last long enough!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Thechelle218
50,Let your inner child loose,"We expected that we would simply wander about looking at exhibits like most museums, but Madame Tussaud's is interactive. Throughout the stations are costume pieces---hats, boas, robes, a straight jacket-- to encourage you to become part of the tableau and take all the photos you'd like. We had such fun being silly and hamming it up with the figures. It is larger than it looks so wear comfortable shoes. There is a station for a posed photo shoot available for purchase, but you'll take plenty on your own.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lindan708
40,A great way to spend an hour,We decided to stop here and snap some photos with the stars. I have been to the one in Las Vegas and knew what to expect. I thought the staff were very friendly and i appreciated the $10 off coupons I found in a magazine from my hotel. I think this is a great rainy day activity. We did find it to be quite hot in the museum.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelingwithJeff
30,"Seen one, seen 'em all","If you've ever been to a wax museum before, you'll know what to expect here. The quality of the figures is hit or miss....some looked horrendous, while others were very good. The props and interactive elements always add to the fun. Horrendously overpriced though. Look for deals or packages before buying.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VacationerGuy
50,Amazing,"Although i was alone. But I took around 50 pic inside. There is alot of celebrities icons there nice to watch include movies characters, politician's, athletics. Etc...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/415ameere
50,Way too much fun!,"We have been to other wax museums in NYC, Vegas, St. Augustine, FL but we have never had as much fun as we had at this one. It's very interactive, with props, clothing and many items that you can use to pose next to the wax figures. Not only do you have fun doing it but the pictures come out amazing. Do not miss this. Even my 16-yr old had a blast!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/516wilmar
50,so life like,We had a great time. The wax figures were amazing. We kept feeling like we were walking into real people. Good lay out. A little pushy with their book but otherwise a nice distraction,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/glendax2
20,holly wood blvd is a bit scary,"We were traveling as a family and between the hawkers and drug addicts, it was a bit scary down Hollywood blvd. Great photos opportunities through with the shop windows and stars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/frenchsketchbooks
30,Something To See,It is neat to see how tall or short the actors were. They have so many actors from Charlie Chapman to Lady Gaga. Its is worth the money you tour on your own.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tonda3546
30,Girls Trip,"This was fun to walk through, but if you have been to one Wax Museum you have been to them all! Something fun to do if you have the time and you are going to Hollywood anyway. Personally Hollywood is overrated and dirty with sketchy people! But hey, it's the experience I guess.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/felicia82004
30,Alright,"We are visiting this attraction due to the dance studio I work at was dancing in front of it. Overall it was ok. Nothing super interesting about it, the figures were alright but nothing super exciting. We walked through it all in under an hour and went shopping after!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/712rebeccahc
20,Not so real,"Was always fascinated by the Madame Tussads Museum as I had heard a lot about it. Was kind of disappointed as to me the images didnt look as life like as they are projected to be. At USD 30, this place is not worth it",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/901aayushk
40,Great attreaction!,You may want to buy the tickets that combine three attractions such as Believe or not Museum and the world records as it is a good value.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CG1a
30,Okay ish,This was my first visit at the wax museum.. I somehow thought they would look more realistic.. It's quite an excellent work overall. I was just expecting it to look more real,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/siddhi261
20,Very disappointing!!,"Having been to Madame Tussaud's in London and NYC this was a huge letdown! Not only was it much smaller but huge actors were not showcased there and it was still very expensive. We were in and out in a very short time. Not worth it in my opinion. If you are in London or NYC, you'll love it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S210NQlisam
50,amazingly beautiful!!,"My first Tussaud's experience and was so excited to visit this while I was in LA. The ticket was $29 last July and it was all worth it. Luckily I got discount coupon from the hotel and the entry fee came down to $21 for me. A good 3-4 level experience with all the celebrity statues surrounded and mind it, they are all life size. So one can figure out how your favorite one looks in real life. My personal favorite was the Marvel's section and of course the 7D movie experience in there. A good 2-3 hour activity.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/flappingfootsteps
40,Get into it!,"Lots of displays with tons of opportunities to have your picture taken with ""celebrities!"" We definitely enjoyed walking through this museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vegasrob
40,Great attraction,"Great fun attraction, which was not overly crowded. Plenty of photo opportunities.Kids had fun, usual tourist attraction ends in gift shop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kmnev
50,Great experience,"Well worth going. Lots of famous people done as wax characters. Good mix movie stars, musicians, old school stars, superheroes for the young at heart. Have fun, be creative with your poses with the characters - it makes the most of the experience and your memories.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrendonF442
30,Good Experience,"Good experience in the heart of Hollywood.Many cheap vouchers handed out in the street, which gave us $10 off each person. That made it better value.We took kids aged 6 and 8 and they didn't really recognise many of the figures. Having said that they still enjoyed having their photos taken with the various figures.Needs updating. Still on Obama as President, and we are in April.I would rate higher for older children or adults.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/931brendanq
50,Fun touristy visit,"We had a blast. I ordered online and I got a slight discount. It is a pain to get there but there was a good parking garage close by. My whole family had a blast. My kids are nine and almost 12 and they loved it. My 75 year old dad loved it too. It's really funny to take crazy picture with the wax celebs. Some are better than others , but super fun. There's only so much time you can spend in Hollywood and this attraction is great!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/502katharinew
30,"With all the hype you'd expect something great...for $30 per person, you would expect something MUCH better!","The Wife finally talked me into going to Hollywood Blvd. First of all, it's sketchy..mind your purses, your Children and your wallet! I wasn't on the Blvd. 5 min when I was approached by a guy with a stack of CD's. He gave me one, scribbled some stuff on it and then asked for a donation. Knowing that I only had large bills on me I politely returned the CD. He offered change for a $20 bill, when I took it out of my pocket, he took off running. Obviously no change. So then we decide to go into Madam Tussauds. $120 for 4 people! Then of course, they want to take a picture of you to sell to you on the way out. It was cool, I guess, but maybe $10 cool. Took 15 min to see the entire thing. My advice is to skip this one while in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/briann688
50,Lot of fun,Had a great time here! Brought the kids as well. Took lots of pictures and we loved every second of it. Very friendly staff! Highly Recommended!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cmezoid
40,Great place with 'waxy celebrities',Like other Madame Tussaud Wax museums this one is also worth a visit well knows displaying celebreties so you can make whatever kind of selfies you want with these,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Steen123456789
30,Just 'good'. Reduced price after 4PM,I've been to other Madame Tussauds before (NY). The Hollywood one is probably not the best. Go after 4PM and get a discount (I think you might need to buy ticket online). Not necessary to print.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gustavo321
40,Wow,"The actual museum was smaller than I had expected, but the wax figures were perfectly positioned and placed into a real life atmosphere, with the occasional music to go along with it. I bought tickets online and got a wax hand at the end of the museum (which is a must do!). Just a few photos as I don't want to spoil much of this for anyone!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gingilla6
50,Wow Amazing!,It its a wax museum where a lot of celebreties are made out of wax and look so realistic that I sometimes blush thinking that they are really looking at meDont forget to take pictures to prank or show your friends that you met the most famous person in the world ;),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AriPadilla
40,Amazing life like figures of your favorites!,"It was amazing how much the wax figures look like your favorite stars, super heroes and legends. Julia Roberts, Bette White, Will Smith and Snoop Dog were my favorites",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shirley1109
50,Best attraction in Hollywood,I am a big fan of wax museums and I have to say this was the best one I have ever visited.our group of 6 ranged in age from 12 to almost 80 and everyone loved it. The wax figures were so real you felt like they were the actual people. This is a not to miss Hollywood attraction.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/heleneab
50,A great place for the entire family in Hollywood,"I went to Madame T's a few years back when it first opened. It was a great experience and is a great place to take the entire family! The figures look nearly exact to the stars they represent, great spot to visit if you are visiting LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ct2118
50,Mandatory experience!,When visit LA don`t forget Madame Tussauds. My 11yo boy loves to take pictures. Our last time I took 235 pictures with him!! Amazing. We know others Madame Tussauds all over the world.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulosM663YE
50,The best wax museum,We had the LA Go card.First time i had ever seen a waxed works i was surprised on how life like they are.You are almost waiting for the stars to reach out and touched you.We got some photos to remind us of our experience and will always tell people in Australia to go the Madame Tussauds in Hollywood.I would like to add people were nice to give you space to take photos and they would hold the camera to take some of yourself next to your favourite star.Thank you Madame Tussauds for a excellent time.......,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeffdownunder007
50,The Stars are Here - Photo Opportunity,"This Madame Tussauds focuses on the Hollywood stars. The likenesses are amazing. Since I know you may never get your picture taken with an actual star, Madame Tussauds allows you to get a facsimile that could fool your family and friends.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VA-Short-Term
40,We Laughed out Way Through,"Having LA Go passes, this was included and didn't require reservations. Our family laughed our way through posing with the Wax figures. It was a quick addition to the other fun activities down the street of Grauman's theater, Dolby theater, walk of stars, etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wendyb282
50,Superb Experience,A great place where one can have a lot of fun. We all had a memorable time and a lot of fun. Superb experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/366shriyam
50,Very fun time with the kids,Took my 11 yr old daughter and we had a blast!! Used the props to take silly pictures and my daughter was able to learn about older actors. Would recommend Madame Tussaud's over Hollywood wax.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/11sadied
30,"Expensive, but impressive!","The admission price is a bit expensive, but the wax mannequins are extremely well done. It is fun, and there are many mannequins. It is a good spot to check off the bucket list in LA, but only worth going to once. And look around at the free brochures near by, there's usually a coupon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Brittcam89
50,An Experience,Much like all the other Madame Tussauds - this one was no different. It was included in one of our trip packages so it passed an hour or so for us.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/roseyr538
50,A fun place to visit,"My wife and I had fun seeing all of the figures, and taking pictures with them. A lot of the figures are so lifelike. The customer service is great, and very friendly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/424lynnr
40,definitely fun to visit,It's one of those things you should probably see at least once. There are plenty of fun facts inside if you want to spend more time reading rather than taking selfies with the wax figures.I thought i'd see more statues but some pretty popular figures were missing. I guess it's specific to each city. In any case it's plenty of fun and it comes with Marvel 4D movie which is quite honestly cheesy and you can easily skip.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stanimirc2014
50,First stop,"My boyfriend and I came to Los Angeles for spring break. We stayed in Hollywood, we were only a 5 minute walk from The Walk of Fame. Madame Tussaud's was our first stop, and it was awesome. We went on a Sunday after 4pm, so it was $5 cheaper than the original price. There was no wait to get in. There are 3 floors of famous wax figures, all of which look so real!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashleyfrederickk
40,Better than expected,"The whole family enjoyed this far more than we thought we would! It is quite expensive, so I'm glad they have added the 4-D iron-man/Marvel experience to help you feel like you get your money's worth. It is what it has always been- A fun experience where you feel like you are actually seeing celebrities. They have stayed fairly current with new super heroes, Jimmy Fallon, and a few others that really impressed my kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bromcd
50,"What Can I Say, It's Fun!","Had no idea what to expect. Tickets were a bonus when purchasing a 48 hour pass on the Starline Bus Tour.Took my teenage son and it turned out to be his favorite activity on the Hollywood strip. The wax figures are very lifelike to the real celebrity. You start out on the 3rd floor and make your way down thru grouped sections. One section had so-called current A-listers, but I had to laugh at what they consider an A-lister. Another section had the stars from the Golden Age of Hollywood (Marilyn Monroe, Bob Hope, George Burns) while another section had western stars such as Clint Eastwood and John Wayne.The fun part for us were the movie dioramas. You are encouraged to pose, touch (but not the face or hair) and stage your own scenes for photos. You could sit in the captain's chair between both Kirk and Picard, be in a boxing ring with Rocky, sit next to the Godfather, ride a bike with ET in the basket or sit on a camel next to Lawrence of Arabia. Some of them even had sound effects and music which made the scenes even more lifelike.Another popular section was the Action Hero wing where you could pretend that an airborne Bruce Lee was kicking you in the head, stand next to the Terminator, James Bond, John McClane or Buffy the Vampire Slayer.Finally the bottom level had the Superheroes of Wolverine, Thor, Ironman, Captain America and Tony Stark. You can sit on Wolverine's motorcycle or hold Capt America's shield for photo-ops.Overall, if you're the type of person who loves Halloween and has no trouble hamming it up for the camera, you'll love this place. My son who hates having his picture taken, was excited to pose with the likes of Conan O'Brian, Simon Cowell, Sly Stallone and Steven Spielberg. Yes, it's campy...but it's also fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Redmonder
50,Madame Tussauds? Count me in!,"It's just in the middle of the Hollywood Walk of Fame and this particular museum of Madame Tussauds it's almost all dedicated to Hollywood and it's stars. You can find Chaplin, Marylin, Fred Astaire...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Danielle_Mansani
50,great place to visit,"I am a caterer, and we have catered many events at Madame Tussauds, including weddings and proms..it's a fun place to bring out of state visitors, and there are a lot of shopping places as well along the Hollywood Boulevard..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/625janetd
40,Fun Way to Spend an Hour,Visited the was museum with my wife and teenage son. Had a good time taking pictures with our favourite stars. The likeness of many of the stars was amazing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K9050ICpaull
40,Much Better than Expected!,"We expected lifelike wax figures, but these were outstanding! And when you step close to them, your eye to their glass eye, you really feel like they are about to jump at you - quite freaky.Also, the space around each figure and the sets they have them staged in mean that you really walk through memory lane with some favorite movies. Those were for the us, but they also have enough contemporary celebrities to engage our teenagers.Like anything, you get out what you put in. Have fun with the fun of it, get into it, and it won't disappoint.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/candicem59
30,It was something to do,The figures were very good but it seemed to be a little sparse. I have been to the one in Vegas and it seemed to have more figures. It was something to do and somewhere to get out of the sun. The kids were amused.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kim318
40,Save money and buy the online evening-only ticket,"My daughter really wanted to go see Madame Tussaud's but I balked at the $30 per person ticket price. I asked the person out front if there were any discounted ticket specials and she said no, so we went back to our hostel (Orange Drive Hostel, just a block away - a gem) and looked online at their website. Sure enough there were several specials. The best bet is $15.95 evening-only ticket. We bought them online, our guest services printed out our tickets, and we headed to the museum. The evening-only ticket is good for 4pm until the museum closes at 8pm. That was plenty of time to see the entire exhibit - we were in there for one hour and really took our time. The figures were amazing and we had fun taking our pictures with them. At the end, there is a 4D Avengers 10 minute movie that is very cute and entertaining. You get a little bit wet, feel your chairs shake and something tickles the backs of your legs, as well as the 3D movie. For $15.95 per person, it's worth it - but I wouldn't pay more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HeatherK111
30,Not enough going on for the price,"The price they charged to get in I figured there would be so much going on inside. Boy, was I wrong. They have a few statues spread out in a couple of rooms.... and that's it. Granted, some of the statues are so realistic (Jason Derulo & Lady Gaga are AMAZING) but still, they can come down on that cover charge some. Really. My family enjoyed the little they did see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Keepitcutecass
50,"hilarious, fun!","A must-do! Central, look for coupons online and in hotels for many discounts. Super interesting and fun, real-lifesize models of the famous stars, great!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/liltravlr
50,Better than the Orlando one,"Living in Orlando we had one open up about a year ago. It's okay, but the one here in Hollywood is better. Not only because it's the original one but because it has more celebrities. If you've never been to either I will tell you these figures are incredibly life like. From the smile to even the smallest freckle. It is definitely worth a stop and walking down Hollywood someone might hand out 50% off vouchers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LuxDres
30,"If you have time to spare then worth a visit, if not give it a miss","The thing that I liked about this Madame Tussauds is that you can get close to the figures and touch them (apart from faces) it's great to get some photos. The selection of characters was good and the attraction is well set out. They offer the chance to have your hand cast in wax however this is an additional $15. I think this should be included in the entrance fee which I already think is above what it should be. It's not somewhere I would visit again, but if you end up with a rainy day or have a go city pass which includes entrance then it's a good time filler.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravellingLX
50,"A Very Fun Experience, and a Great Way to ""Meet"" Your Favorite Stars","Let me start by mentioning that I had been to Madame Tussauds once before, in NY, when I was much younger, so I decided to make a return trip during my LA vacation - and I did not walk away disappointed. Madame Tussauds Hollywood boasts three floors of exhibit space, and each floor houses the figures of dozens of celebrities and famous movie and TV characters. I was beyond impressed at how lifelike each figure is - get up-close to each figure and you will be blown away by how every small detail is stressed and depicted. It truly feels like the celebrities are in the room with you - none of the figures look fake or strange. Madame Tussauds Hollywood also has a 4-D Marvel movie at the end of the tour, so that enhanced the visit as well. I would recommend Madame Tussauds Hollywood for anyone looking for a fun day trip!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/610elank
40,They look good in Wax.,"Madame Tussauds was not as big as I had expected it to be, I guess I thought it would be something like a big warehouse instead of the neat multi-storey complex that it is. Couldn't get over how real the characters look. The creators have certainly captured the character of their models. It was great to meet John Wayne, Clint Eastwood, John Travolta and Elvis. Even got to shake hands with Mr Obama! Great place to spend an hour or two.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/path893
40,Visit in Hollywood,"Great place to visit on Hollywood Blvd! I've been to several Madame Tussaud museums around the country, this is par with most others. I visited this place with the LA go pass which I purchased on Groupon so if your are planning to visit many places in LA consider getting pass!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/997danielleg
30,Nice for a look,Nice to have a look around but glad we didn't pay full price. Good idea to book online before hand for discounted tickets for evening entry. Benefit of going at night is less people around so you get a better chance to take photos uninterrupted.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brookeahoward
50,Fun day for the kids,"Really like going to Madame Tussaud's, I have now been to 5 different ones over the world so far.i enjoy going really like this one as Demi lovato is in it , I have met her in person when she came to Glasgow uk, but now I have saw here wax works too. A lot of good celebs in this one too",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StaceyJ825
50,Must see attraction!,"Loved this place!! The wax figures are very well done, they look exactly like the real thing! The atmosphere inside is fun and upbeat. You have the opportunity to take green screen photos before you enter which are available for purchase at the end. I found the photos to be reasonably priced compared to other places I have been. Very happy that I chose to visit while I was in Hollywood!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/courtyalana
50,Spring break,My son wanted to visit I was dreading thinking this place would be corny. Boy was I wrong we both had so much funIt's amazing how realistic the figures are! We had a blast posing and taking pictures they had characters and movie sets for all ages to enjoy! Please visit you'll love it,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vlad178tx
40,Never know who you could run into,"We were very pleased at the quality & variety of the display at Madame Tussaud. The quality of the figures were excellent. Their facial features of the celebrity were current and not dated. Located on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. We were able to stand with our favourite person for a photo, you could touch the figures except the face. This was our most likely way to spot a cleb and have a photo",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TPTravellers
50,So much fun!,I went with my 3 teen girls and we spent about 90 minutes checking out all of the stars! It was a blast! Joanna helped us get a group discount and it made it a little more affordable. The short 4D movie was a fun bonus surprise!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/825dianep
40,A bit of waxy cheese,"Kind of a last minute idea. We wanted to see the Hollywood walk of fame and heard that it was kind of a congested mob of people. So, we decided to go to the wax museum which is right next door to the Mann's Chinese theatre. This ended up being a great idea. We got to see the walk of fame and the Chinese theatre and duck into the wax museum which was not too crowded. Three levels... modern day, classic Hollywood,  and historical figures. I thought it wood be really cheesy and it was, but sometimes you want a bit of cheese. Great opportunity for pictures. The pictures that they take and try and sell you are outrageously overpriced,  but ask them to use your phone and they will.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/edmundp2015
50,Must See.,"Great Place to visit for the whole family, suitable for all ages & something for everyone.Tickets are very reasonably priced & if you purchase a ticket to see the Ripley's believe it or not museum & Guinness Book of records museum at the same time it works out heaps cheaper to see the 3.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/651yvettef
30,Fun time-killer,"Don't plan your day around this attraction, but many of the figures are amazing. It's fun for kids and teens to pose with their favourite stars, but more than an hour here would be too much.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/5gordons
50,Fun for the Whole Family!,We enjoyed this visit! There was a celebrity favorite for everyone in our group. Our tour was late in the day on a Wednesday and it was not crowded at all. We easily took pictures with every wax figure there. It is located in a fun area with lots to do and see. I would definitely go back!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tammyl98
40,Awesome Time at Madame Tussauds!,"It was interesting and full of many movie stars that we know. We did although think that there would be more stars. I don't know if they were offsite or at another location. We were a little confused by the layout getting from the third floor to the second but quickly figured it out. The staff was very kind and helpful. We enjoyed getting a wax hand. There was a wax figure in the western section that had no tag and we could no ID her, we think it could be Natalie Wood but really sad that we could not tell. A lot of the stars are very, very well done but some a little funky around the mouth. We really could not tell that was Julia Roberts something really off on that one. Really enjoyed our visit, well worth it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thekingofswapmeets
40,Non-stress fun activity,"Went today, 03/10, after a warm long walk on Hollywood Blvd, we decided to wonder in and see the stars. I purchased discounted tickets (while standing in line) on their website and saved $10 a person. The teens that thought it was going to be boring really enjoyed it. With the $20.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrandiS718
50,It was so much fun!,"It was such an awesome experience. It was so cool to be able to get that close to a wax figure. My toddler loved it! The only thing I wish the museum provided was a step stool. I'm only 5 feet tall and it was hard to get a good selfie with the figures. I know it might be a safety issue, but if it isn't, I think it would be an awesome thing to have available. Other than that, the museum was great!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elizabethtM5502IY
50,Loved it and the pictures we took here were priceless!,"The wax museum has an interesting layout. The figures stand right in the middle of the floors making it easy for you to take pictures. On your way out they tempt you with custom made wax figures of your hands...if you are interested in this, definitely get the souvenir book they sell on the way in - it includes 2 for 1 hand wax figures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DawnV541
40,Different kind of Museum,"My wife had this on her must do list in Hollywood. I was skeptical but ended up spending almost 2 hours. It's as fun as you make it, dressing up in some of the props and taking photos makes for a very interactive experience. We bought out tix online for 24.99 and it included a souvenir wax hand ( using your own). (Buy tix online it is wayyyy cheaper). We also did a photo package at the end that seemed expensive-5 photos for 40$ until we found out it also included all of the photos taken by any of the photographers throughout the visit (there were 3 of us so we ended up with 16 photos!). Overall if you go with an open mind and a good attitude. You'll enjoy this!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/celtics323
20,It's ok,We got a deal with our 'hop on hop off' bus ticket to come here. I wouldnt have come otherwise just because I am not into this kind of thing. We went right before closing which was actually a good time to go because there were not people everywhere so you could pose with the wax figures. It is three stories of wax figures and a few interactive things too. It was interesting seeing how tall they or how skinny they would be.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/189shellc
40,Surprisingly Entertaining & Fun!,"I really did not want to do this! But we had some time to kill before watching a taping of Jimmy Kimmel so I thought ""what the heck!"" I've not been to one before because it always seemed like such a pathetic tourist trap. Well, it IS a tourist trap but it fits right in with the rest of the tourist traps along Hollywood Blvd. My wife & I had fun being silly, posing and taking pictures with the wax statues. Stupid & corny? Yes! But we embraced it and had a good time. Not sure we'd ever go back to this one again (been there done that) but may go to other cities' if we are looking to kill some time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Legamania
50,great fun,really life like wax people we had a great time and would recommend to anyone traveling into the area,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maryrA8629ZN
40,A bit of fun,This was better than we thought. It was certainly fun. Set over 3 floors with a lift available. We bought tickets online and got a great deal after 4pm.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/411steves
30,Cool,"My mom has been trying to get to this place for a few years. We had time to kill at the end of our trip, so we dropped in there. Some of the wax people look pretty real, while others look like a fake wax mannequin. One of my favorites and most realistic looking was Bruce Willis as John McClain. It was fun to go through and take silly poses with the mannequins. It wasn't crowded, so we got through the whole thing in about an hour. If you go with more than two people, expect to be there longer since everyone will want pictures with their favorite stars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KNic0le
50,Amazing!,"Excellent attraction into Hollywood Boulevard. You can spend an great time taking your own pictures with every wax Hollywood character (Terminator, Bruce Lee, Dirty Harry, James Bond, Katniss, the Godfather, Avengers, and lot more) as well as historical as President Obama, Marilyn Monroe.

10,No Revert,"Have visited Los Angels for 2 days and on 26th of Feb 2017 i have booked the online Tickets for Two person .But while reaching to Madam tussauds location the show was canceled due to Academic award security reason .And there is no any intimation on internet regarding the bookings .Requesting you kindly refund the ticket amount ,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deepakj963
50,Pleasantly surprised,"I've been to many other wax museums usually just as something to do. I was very impressed with the realism of the figures here, they really do their homework when creating them. The staff was also enjoyable and friendly. The 4D Marvel movie was also more entertaining than I was expecting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrFrump
30,Good place to visit for 1st timers !!!!,"Had good time with kids, had fun in 4D show as well :)The only thing, parking nearby is not easy :(",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ArvindS1627
40,A Bit Tired but still Fun,Just like every other Madame Tussauds thoughout the world that we have been too but this was a first for our teenager. She loved it! The exhibits were probably a little tired but were fine if this is your first Madam Tussauds experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JWoody65
50,We had a great time!,The fun was in posing and taking the pictures! I seriously have avoided Wax Museums for my entire life but my niece who was raised in Washington really wanted to go. We had a blast!!! The pictures we took are priceless. I haven't laughed that hard in so long. Try it! You might be surprised at how much fun you have!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gabyr905
50,When You Can't Meet Them In Person....,"My sister, son, and I had a blast walking around and ""posing"" with some of our favorite stars. Some of the wax figures are spookingly real looking (especially Betty White). It wasn't extremely crowded so we were able to take our time posing for the perfect picture.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hawaii_BoundMichigan
50,decent time,Had a pretty nice time here. Pretty cool realistic wax figures nice views in certain rooms. I prefer the one in Vegas a little more but if your in area I would definitely check it out,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kendalllett
50,Having a gala time with the stars!,"So many hollywood stars immortalized here, it feels great to be in the presence of your favorite movie stars!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/indrajitg2014
40,Touristy but a must see when your in Hollywood,"I have to admit I was impressed. It was super fun and the wax figures are really amazing. We spent a long time taking pics with the figures and enjoyed learning about the process and history. It's worth the money, although expensive I felt it was worth it and if your going to see all the is Hollywood and your right there it's worth a visit",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tessalovestravel
30,"Well, glad we didn't pay full price...","Was quite looking forward to this as it was my birthday but, oh dear, what a disappointment! Luckily, we had a voucher, so saved a few dollars getting in - but even so what a waste of time! I'm not usually so negative about things, but will make an exception this time.Now I don't expect to know some of the characters as they are mostly American, but you have some ideas of what they look like. I was very disappointed with Fred & Ginger, Captain Kirk and a few others including Daniel Craig - I mean - Madam T's are supposed to be the experts in this: what happened??Added to that, it only took us about 30 minutes to get around as the characters were very spaced out...Expected better in Hollywood - reluctant to recommend in this case.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trotty73
50,Great Time with The Stars - Buy Tickets Online.,"Despite opening 30 minutes later than advertised, this was a great time during a drissley morning in LA.If you purchase tickets online (even a day before you go) you can save a ton and even get a wax hand + admission for less than the walk up price.Overall with the online ticket pricing this a great place to visit while in Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Adroso360
50,Weekend getaway,We decided to hop on a plane from Texas to LA on the whim. We were looking for something fun to do and decided to go to this wax museum. It was reasonably priced and much bigger than I expected. We really enjoyed it. Super realistic.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G6044VXjulieg
40,I hugged Iron Man lol,I just love posing with all the figures. I have to do it every time I am in any city with a Madame Tussauds.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ledbytheunknown
40,Great fun,This was a great place to visit and have fun! The wax figures were so realistic that you'd be waiting for them to pop out at you. Staff was fun and friendly. It's easy to get lost in the moment there especially if you love the silver screen stars. Very amazing!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fernandezbalino
50,Great day with the stars,We were a party of 9. 4 Adults and 5 kids ages 10-16. We had a great time posing with all the stars. New and classic stars. Really enjoyed the 4D movie at the end of the tour. Location is perfect.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SimiValley_CAMomof3
50,A remarkable experience !,This place is a must see! A remarkable experience that you must go through if you are in LA. We tooks tons of photos and enjoyed the friendly environment.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bassem_zamel
40,Strike a pose!,Now is the right time to take as many photos as you like with your favourite fiction characters & celebrities! Most of the wax statues are close to reality! Have fun!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lilyc693
10,Just don't do it,I visited Madam Tussauds in London a few years back and it was amazing. So many levels. A ride. A 3D show. It was amazing. I was speaking to a ticket officer out side and mentioned that I had been to the London one and if I should bother visiting this one. He said it's so much better. He also lied. Spend your money on something else.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/98sarahc
50,Brilliant few hours spent here,Spent about 3 hours in here taking photos with our favourite stars really had a good laugh. It was very busy first thing when we went so got plenty of time to pose and take photos,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cazm23
40,Waxy,Really fun to take friend here that are visiting from out of town because they get photos with celebrities.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CaribbeanFan79
50,Good to kill a few hours,I spend a few hours in here to hide from the rain in hollywood. I found this one wasn't as good as the one in the london but was good for a taster. Quite small but still fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kara929
50,See the celebrities in Hollywood!!!!,"I'm a big fan of Madame Tussaud's and always like to visit and this one was no different. Amazing statues of people such as Will Smith, Snoop, Rihanna and Beyoncé. There is a big window upstairs which has a nice little view of the boulevard.If you can go when it opens as that was what I done and I was the only one in the attraction for about 20 minutes which was nice as I could just wander around and take pictures without any one in my way and then when people did come I was a head of them which again was nice in regards to taking pictures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sharmaynes2016
50,Wow!!!,"I haven't visited the other ones, so I can't compare it. Even though, we thought it was really cool. You can see the famous as real as they are. Sometimes we saw stand people and they looked like famous too. The statues look so real. You can imagine that you are with the most famous people and imagine that they are smiling only to you. You can touch them, except their hair or face. It was a very good experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cote-Va-Chile
50,So lifelike!,Had been to a Madame Tussaud's in vegas before but thought we would do here and the experience was great again. So lifelike! Did as part of our Go Los Angeles card which was well worth the money btw!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/23tiffanyk
30,Kind of felt like a bit of a rip-off.,"It was cool to see some of the silver screen's biggest stars immortalized in statues, but I felt for the price there could have / should have been more. The random stops along the way for photo ops could have been used for more than a cash grab.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bear187k
50,Good Hollywood experience,"Really good selection of wax works. My favourites were Al Pacino, Robert Deniro and JLo. Lots of singers, actors and actresses. A must see if you love Hollywood and celebrities.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/V3661XNsoniar
40,A great way to spend one hour,"I've been to a few of these and this one didn't disappoint. Very well lit so you can clearly see all the individual features that define the celebrities. A fantastic layout too, with lots is space so that you can get all the photos you want to. We had many laughs during our visit. My youngest daughter's attraction to Hugh Heffner was strangely disturbing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/547vickik
40,Enjoyable,"Madame Tussauds surprise me . I had lot of fun with my wife taking ourselfs picture with the Figures. At the end , as a bonus , you enter a very enjoyable 4D short movie Which was lot of fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/outlander11
50,"Fun, Fun, Fun",Better than I anticipated. Had lots of fun. Plus there was more to do than just see wax figures. Pleasantly surprised!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HonestGal88
40,Essential Hollywood Experience,"The only place in Hollywood that basically guarantees a celebrity sighting. Wax figures are flawless. They run the gamut from today's stars, to athletes, to icons of Old Hollywood. Fun extras along the way, and best of all no ropes! There is nothing stopping you from taking pictures of and with your favorite stars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rem4
50,So Cool,"Most of the wax models are really good. As a Brad Pitt fan I was a little disappointed that he had bags under his eyes. Probably spot on, but he just looked a little rougher than I would have liked. Jason Derulo was amazing and Gaga looked breathtaking. I loved Paul Newman and Robert Redford. Betty White was absolutely adorable. This is a must see while in Hollywood and good for the entire family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pmcheesecakes
50,Fun Fun Fun,Great adventure into Madame Tussauds was a great few hours. Great to see all the characters and take pictures with them and have a laugh,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P1030JZjennifern
50,Awesome attraction,Great family attraction. Reasonably priced- exciting and realistic. Different rooms filled with stars from the past and present,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karenmZ7529IR
40,Visit to Madame Tussauds Hollywood,"Visited the museum in second week of January,2017 at Hollywood,LA.It is a lifetime view of different celebraties in wax models.After purchasing the ticket, you enter the building comprising of three floors.you can start from top to bottom OR bottom to top. I started from top floor i.e.3rd floor and went down to ground floor. The muesum is nicely divided with models of Hollywood celebraties, sports persons, top directors, heroes, heroines, singers etc.You will be overwhelmed by watching the actual size models as if you are watching your favorites in real life.It is worth visiting.Cost of tickets is also reasonable.S C Gandhi",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scg11219
40,Great,Thats the first time to visit Madame Tussaud'sI really enjoyed the modelsTry to buy tickets online it is cheaper (22.5$),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Moury1989
40,Like Visiting the Hollywood Legends,"The multi-floor building features life-size wax replicas of some of the most famous people in movie history. All were well done and each was placed in a setting for which they were well-known. I would have liked to have seen more wax replicas of other stars, but there is only so much room.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Karl2010
40,"Howdy, Partner","We looked at John Wayne's footprints and then came face to face with him in Madame Tussauds. I was a bit disappointed - he seemed smaller than on the big screen. Many current and former personalities were portrayed in the museum, making for an interesting hour. The visit was ""enhanced"" by small children running wildly through and not understanding what was happening. Music could have been toned down. Enjoyed the opportunity. Who knew????",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KarenK978
50,Lots of fun selfying the wax stars.,-We had a good 2 hours of fun taking selfies with the stars.-Visited late in the night and it wasn't busy at all. We had a lot of time to have fun with every single exhibition.-Definitely highly recommended.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Frank327
40,What to do in Hollyweird if you don't know what to do,"We booked the tickets tongue-in-cheek to take our friends from overseas, it was a good way to spend an hour.I like that you're allowed to touch the figures (except the face/hair) and we took some kitschy photos. (If I saw one more guy take a photo with his hand on Brittany Spears' breast I was going to vomit). There are paid photo ops too but we opted out so I don't know what they are, but they seemed pricey!Even if you're not into celebs, you'll probably find at least a couple of the figures interesting/intriguing.The museum is laid out over three floors, you take a small, slow elevator to the top floor and work your way down. Lots of stairs but I saw handicap signs so you can likely take the elevator by arrangement.The element I found MOST interesting is the history and how the figures are made. I'm confused why they don't start with that section at the top, so visitors could better appreciate what they'll be seeing. Instead that was last as you exit.This section of Hollywood feels like a mini, overcrowded, dirty Vegas these days so it was nice to walk through with our guests to check out the stars at Graumans enroute to the museum so they can say they've been to Hollywood--then GET OUT and have lunch elsewhere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SJWolf66
50,The place was amazing for Hollywood lovers.,"If you love films and famous actors over the years, then this is the perfect place for all of you. One of my favorite wax figures was Jessica Alba.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z3169TUchristianf
50,Go later in the day if you can,"Great fun, even if you have been to a Madame Tussauds before as they all seem to be different.For the best fun, use the props and take some funny photos with your favourite stars. Some of them look more lifelike than others. I also enjoyed seeing how big or small they were in real life (the models are made to the same proportions as the person).It will probably take between 1-2 hours and if you can go after 4pm (it's open until 7pm), book tickets online as they are half price. I would have said this was expensive at $30 per person but for $15 I thought it was very reasonable. And there was hardly anyone else there!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Walkingwombles
50,Great time,"Pros: if you have a sense of humor this is a blast! They allow you to take pictures with the figures and sometimes have props with different celebrities. There are figures from all genres and decades, something for all ages. They have photographers at different stages to take professional pics and they aren't pushy at all.Cons: be prepared for the crowds. Just have patience and you will have a blast",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RebeccaWCarmel
40,A lot of fun !,"A few of friends and I went there . We had a lot of fun there , taking pictures with president Obama , handsome George Clooney , Paul Newman , Robert Redford and........ .we laughed a lot and its nostalgic atmosphere was really nice . Highly recommended .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kokabu
50,Fun!,We always enjoy these. I'm like a kid in a candy store. Lol. They have all of the favorites and it's 3 floors so there's plenty to see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jamesmom1
30,Only if this is the only MT u can visit,"I have been to other MT wax museums, so comparatively this one is just ok. Visited as it was a chance for my wife to see the first MT and got a deal tickets.The figurines are just ok, most of them look fake (unlike some other museums) and the main reason for losing 2 stars is the placing of figures and lightening. That makes it difficult to take good photos.Expected better standard for Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dr_Babar_Khan
40,Interesteing,"Well worth a visit - the life like models in most cases are quite astounding. Some look a little plastic but it is a great attraction with many, many photo opportunities.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travelbags4
50,Great Wax Museum,"My inlaws had fun in this place. They made all sorts of poses. My son and hubby had a goofy time too using all the props. The wax figures looked realistic, had goosebumps I thought they made sudden movements. Lastly the 4D is fun, my son loved it. We did the night entry for $15. Good thing I did that because we breezed thru it in 45 mins.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maroselb
40,Stars tip- for the wax museum,"My husband has always wanted to go here back at home (in Australia) and whilst we were on the hollywood boulevard we were pleased to finally go to a Madame Tussauds wax gallery.TIP- If you really want to see your favourite stars. You need to find out where they're located. So all the stars we wanted to see like Rihanna, Johnny Depp, Taylor Swift, Angelina Jolie etc were at the Hollywood museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melesinaf
50,Very realistic,The wax models were very realistic. But I felt that the price was too steep. All the stars were arranged according to different theme which was nice.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/738siddarthm
40,My 13 year old daugher loved it,"Went here because my 13 year old daughter wanted to go , we had a fun time taking pictures and cracking jokes , the whole family enjoyed it , do not pay full ticket price , there are guys on the streets with coupons , some 10 bucks off but others have half off , make sure you grab oen",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ubenumber2
30,go to the real hollywood wax museum,go to the real holly wood wax museum is much better if you like this sort of thing. both are close together. but this one is open later.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/justins866
30,"Expensive and crowded, but makes for some cool pictures.","I had some guest come from out of town and wanted to take them to the typical travel attractions. The location is great since you can walk the walk of stars, see the Chinese theater and stop by the madame tussauda museum. There were a lot of wax figures which was nice but pricey to get in and lots of crowds. Try to go before it gets busy so you are able to take all the fun pictures before the crowds show up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/11rachaelg
50,wax museum,there are 2 wax museums located within a block. this one by far is the best. Its located next to the chinese theater. There are 3 floors of famous figures made of wax. Very good likeness.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cat330
20,What a disappointment!,"This wax museum is rather small and we actually went through it in less than an hour. There is not so much to see but most of the figures are pretty well done so if you are into taking photos with ""celebrities"" maybe you can spend more time here. I would rather spend this time elsewhere and skip the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TittaK21
50,Love it!,"Me and my friend were visiting this incredible wax museum last December 2016. We were really amazed by the details of replicas. We also experienced the 4D marvel superheroes too! (included in the ticket i guess). By the way, there are two good options for ticket price: 1) buy night admission via website (around $15 from $30 regular ticket) or 2) get coupon on Los Angeles tour map (coupon worth $7). Me and my friend were using the coupon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dyahp295
50,Really cool museum,Who doesn't want a museum in a place like Hollywood where there are movie stars. Inside you will see statues that look like the real faces of your favorite stars. This is somewhere you must swing by when on the Hollywood Walk of Fame....,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/buddhakouri
40,WAX MUSEUM,"What a nice replicas made out of wax of great actors and national figures. This museum is similar to Florida and Hongkong branches. The place is nice and well maintained. you can take photographs with these wax icons. Each icon is dressed up exactly as they looked in real, that is fantastic. Tickets are available on the spot and entry was smooth.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vaida17
40,Coupons available outside,My kids had a fun time here. Coupons available from street vendors. It wasn't very crowded and had many famous people.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jason_and_Tania
10,No 4d video,"Underwhelming experience to say the least.After waiting for more than 30 minutes (from 5.15 pm to 5.50 pm) to see next Marvel Super Heroes 4D video (approx 10-15 minutes playing time) that run continuously for all opening time, the waiter told me that ""she was not a machine "" and that there'll be no new shows for at least another hour.An Asian family, too, waited for the same time and must go away without seeing the video.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/66giorgioc
50,Cool Place!,This place was so cool! I really enjoyed all of the wax figures! The staff was very nice and the entire property was very clean! Was a nice touch to a trip to LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/168levis
50,Terrific,I've been to Madame Tussauds in New York City and London. This more interesting because it was really nice to see the figures of famous actors and of President Obama! not to be missed even if you have been to others.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melissahP4828PR
50,"Not ""waxy"" at all :-)","We LOVED this, and each of us were spooked at least once when turning around and being in the EXACT eyeline of one of the figures - doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo!!!!!! VERY realistic, and the fact that you can use the props provided to get into the photo just adds to the experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/996ronw
40,Fun!,We had a Go LA pass so this attraction was included. You can also find coupons everywhere so there is no need to pay the $30 admission price advertised. There are 3 floors to explore and the experience ends with a 4d superhero movie. My son's favorite part was making a wax figure out of his hand (additional cost).,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jpatter471
50,A place not to be missed,Nostalgic moments to see wax actors and actresses of yester years ! It was good to take snaps by the side of the wax look-a-likes.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YathienderS
50,When in Hollywood.....,"If you've never done Madame Tussaud's before then a visit here is sure to delight. It was good fun and when we went (weekday) it wasn't crowded which made for great photo opportunities on our part. My teenage boys loved Master Chief, Star Trek and Terminator exhibits. Heaps of fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hava2612
10,Horrible,"Don't waste your money. Terrible staff, Rude and nasty. Wax figures look like the rejects from NY and LV. To Bad.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cdalisera10
50,Great fun for all the family,"Saw this whilst walking along the boulevard had time so thought why not , wow what a great tour had so much fun in here it wasn't crowded so you had time for great photos and they had appropriate props for the figures, they have everyone in here John Wayne to Taylor Swift got a good photo of me and Marlon Brandothey also have a 15min film to watch in 3D which was very good, thought the entrance cost was a bit high but after we had been round it was worth every penny, a must do if you have an hour or two to spare,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stephenaH5280RQ
40,Awesome,"The price for admission was pretty reasonable. Went during a non busy time so it was awesome, can imagine might be a little annoying if it were crowded though. The wax figures were really awesome and very life like. Was surprised there weren't more major stars though but I know they transport a lot of the figures to other worldwide Madame Tussaud's locations. Overall was a cool experience and would recommend for something fun to do in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/blackheartsquid
40,Good,It was nice. We had a discounted ticket but still very expensive. The pictures we took were very very cute. Staff was very nice and courteous. The museum itself was very very nice. The figures were lifelike in good condition and quality. I did feel like it lacked a little bit though for the expensive price it was for us to get in. We were told at the end of the tour that some of the figures were removed from the museum. Other than that it was a nice experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/victoriar437
30,Very limited range of models.,"We had free entry to Madame Tussauds with our hop on, hop off bus ticket. I would have been unhappy had I paid the $29 charge. The models were generally lifelike but this was really a photo opportunity to take a selfie with a Hollywood star.. Apart from Barrack Obama there were no exhibits from outside the world of showbiz. Celebrity is not my thing so I was quite disappointed although the facts and figures about how the waxworks are made are quite interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Otteraswas
50,Loved the hand wax experience!,"My 17 year old had never been to a wax museum, so what better place than the Hollywood location to experience it. Our favorite part of the visit was the opportunityto have her own hand replicated in wax. It made a perfect souvenir.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/katrac23
40,So realistic,"This was amazing! We would recommend for the whole family. We mostly liked that there were no crowds, because in London, you could hardly move.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/850mayankg
50,Fun fun fun!!,This is a la must do!! So much fun!! The figures are so life like and you can pose and take pictures with them just don't touch hurt faces or hair. So many stars from so many eras. Not crowded and located right in the middle of the action! Can get a $10 off coupon from the sidewalk from the museums advertisers. Centrally located on the Hollywood boulevard. Loved this place!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andyncrystanr
40,A fun way to spend a couple of hours,We had a great time in here. Lots of laughs posing with some of the models and most are really very good. Lots of photos and recommend worth a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PDHarry
40,Took the family and really enjoyed it!,"The family went here and really enjoyed the museum. This is a great mix of new and old Hollywood and was great to go and see with the family. This is really a 1 hour visit, maybe a bit longer but definitely not an all day thing. The amount of effort and detail that goes into the creation of these stars is really impressive and many of them look very life like. I liked that along with all the current stars the museum also included a good mix of the classic stars from before I was born. It pays homage to Hollywood today and yesterday in a very nice way.This museum is fun and neat to do with the kids but it is a bit pricey and not something we would probably do again any time soon. You see it once for an hour or so and you are good for a while.Long an short, get discount coupons online and go do it to enjoy! It is definitely worth it the first time around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dbartoletti
30,Average,"We weren't expecting to visit this Madame Tussauds, but we had free tickets. I think if you have seen one you have seen them all, this is just as exciting as the one in Vegas.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Duciaume206
40,Madame Tussauds Wax Museum,"It was pretty good. There's a few floors of figures with plenty of them set up to take cute pics with. You can shoot hoops with Kobe, sit on the bench with Forest Gump, etc. At the end of the walk through there is a small theatre which we almost walked past that plays a 10 minute 4D superhero movie. It was pretty good!It was interesting enough but I don't know if it would be worth paying $30 USD to go. Out in the street and in some businesses you will see coupons for 1/2 off admission. Don't pay full price! My entrance fee was included in the Go Los Angeles card which has been great for filling our days.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DyinToTravelBy
40,Very interesting place to visit,"Very nice and clean with a good mix of ""old"" and ""new"" film and TV stars to keep everyone happy. The ""Avengers"" room was a real hit with my son. A lot of the actors are not what you would imagine they were. Pierce Brosnan is quite a lot taller than in the movies. Well worth the effort.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/245henrym
50,Fun tour!,"If your visiting the Walk of Stars, you have to check out the wax museum. Lots of photo ops with older and more recent figures as well as a staged professional shot for purchase at the end of your visit. Gift shop at the end of your tour with lots of souvenirs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/U6422JKsusang
50,Loved every minute of it,"This was an amazing experience and was my 1st time to a wax museum. All of the models were good and some of them were great. When I walked into the room with Betty White, it took my breath away. Felt like she was actually there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dmills58
30,Smaller then you'd think,"Right on the Hollywood star walk, you can't miss the wax museum. Most of the wax figures have props that you can use to take pictures. Take your time, or else it will only take about 10 minutes to walk through all of it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kaitlin8899
50,BIG BANG FOR YOUR BUCKS !,Was really surprised how fun this was. Really life like and plenty of interactive exhibits. Best to budget more time as tons to see. Bring your camera for great photo ops.You are offered a lot of paid for photos as well.Great for all ages.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/madisons709
50,The Best Fun Ever!,"This museum was so much fun! Taking pictures with the wax figures, especially the ones that looked exactly like the person. I thought I might be a little creeped out, but I wasn't. Loved it! They will try and sell you photo packages as photographers are stationed in the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yjbonner
50,So realistic,Myself and a group of friends decided to visit Madame Tussauds while on our first trip to LA and I can say it was worth it. All of the wax figures were so realistic and we took tons of pictures. I'd definitely go again when I travel to another city since the figures are different.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EarlBS
50,Madame tussaud Wax Museum,The tour at the museum was awesome.It was fun posing for pictures with the waxed icons. They all look so real .At the end of the exhibits we got to see a 10 minute Marvel 4D film. Our chairs vibrated and we even got wet during the showing of the film as if we were there. We felt like we were at a team park..,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SandraS2013
50,Awesome!!,"I wasn't sure what to expect.First of all, my son is a Marine and they gave great discounts. He got in free and family accompanying him received a 50% discount.The place was amazing. The wax figures were so life like. We took a ton of pics. What I liked is that there were several spots along the way where a photographer would take pics with your camera and theirs, load them on a card for you to purchase at the end. But since i had them uae my camera I really didnt need to buy them.Definitely coming back with my daughter.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/U7992WCpaulat
50,Wax adapted for Hollywood,"This was a wax museum especially created for Hollywood. All of the wax replicas depicted artists from the music, television, and film industries with a few sports heroes thrown in for good measure. Most of the replicas took out breath away because they were so realistic. At the end of the exhibits we were invited to see a 10 minute Marvel 4 D film. It was GREAT! This was not our typical movie choice and we did not know all of the names of the Marvel heroes, but the technology was out of sight! We could not wait to see what was coming up! We had not planned to go to this attraction, but it was part of our Explorer Pass and we are glad it was!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CyndyandByron
50,One of the best,Very good wax works where they do actually look like the stars. Lots to see and very well laid out. Try to get a discount coupon for other attractions too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vegas-Queen666
50,5 minutes walk from the Magic Castle Hotel,By staying at the Magic Castle Hotel we were given discount voutures to get into Madame Tussauds but it would have been worth paying full price as it was a great experience,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rpound
50,Loved it!,"We really enjoyed the Madam Tussauds wax museum in Hollywood. The stars are so lifelike, its incredible! Such fun to pose for photos with the ""stars"". Was such fun to go here and I would highly recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LindyL363
40,Come visit your best friends,My husband had his picture taken with star trek fellows. Quite a diversity of stars from many walks of life. Do not miss.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lawlady271
40,Great way to spend a couple of hours,We got a free ticket to go to Madame Tussaud's as part of a purchase of a hop on hop off bus tour with Starline Tours.Great way to waste a couple of hours mingling with the wax doppelgangers of celebrities across the ages. Being Hollywood there is a great range of recognisable movie stars along with sporting stars and music icons.Air conditioned (which is fab on a hot day) and a cool gift shop at the end.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suebD3058ZE
40,Apparently not all the celebrities came to the party,"It's a do-it-yourself your. If all the celebrities you like are there, you will enjoy it. If they are not, you will still enjoy it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mpho3105
50,So lifelike you expected them to speak,"Incredible, unnerving and amazing talent all in one venue. I felt as though the 'subjects' would start talking to me at any given moment, and feel really sure that some of them were looking at me....so very real.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/197lesleym
40,Interesting,Probably spent a couple hours here. There's a public parking at N McCadden Pl which cost us $20. We just visited this place and not very familiar where best to park. We came here in the morning hoping that it wouldn't be too crowded. The wax display was great and can take pictures with them. There are some that were unfamiliar to you and you take time to read a small summary of who they were.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/byDIXIE
50,Worth every penny,"This is the best madame tussauds ive every been to. The only downside is that it's located on hollywood blvd, so if you go here, park near here. If you drive so far down on hollywood blvd that you start to see characters, you've gone too far.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hothunny
50,Fun,"This wax museum is so much fun. We've never been to one before, so I cannot compare to others. You can take pictures with the stars, there are props all over the place, you can get into the bicycle with ET. My 5 year old had a very good time. I would definitely recommend to families that are visiting LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aricaballero
40,Unique place,We visit with the family my girlsEnjoy to see the wax actors and singers they look kind of real . I thinkIt is Over price to see and it only took us half a hour to see everything inside . It is nice to take pictures with your favorite actor or singer .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Salaamus
50,Outstanding,Great place to take lots of pictures with your favorite actors. Enjoyed every time every moment visiting this place. Thanks to the team member we got 50% discount on tickets for been there first time. Loved this place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Reviewer1216
40,A Breeze,Straight up you go to the third floor and work your way down to the ground floor. Finish up with the Avengers 4D and exit through the gift shop. Lots of photo opportunities. It will take about an hour.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pkislaya
40,Anything for Salenas,"My sister is a huge Selena fan, and we spent the weekend in Universal Studios and decided to go see Selena at Madame Tussauds. We loved it! And the Selena replica was amazing! We loved being able to take pictures with props and to be able to interact scenes. The guys had a blast in the Super Hero 4D Movie. No complaints, definitely worth the money! We are looking forward to our next visit with our niece!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/djlaw75
40,Bring a camera!,"We enjoyed Madame Tussauds. The sculptures are very life like, and it's interesting to read about their careers. Some celebs even have photo props to go with them. You can just walk through and look at the sculptures or you can have a lot of fun ""interacting' with the sculptures and taking pictures. They have a nice variety of current celebs and classic celebs. You move through the exhibit at your own pace. Bought tickets online and not only saved money, but also didn't have to wait in line. Double win. Was so glad we stopped in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SNBingham
40,Nice tour,"The best part of these, is the interaction with the wax statues. You have hats, jackets, signs and everything you need to take a good picture with the celebrities. Most of them are very realistic. Kids have fun also!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/edmundo_osorio
40,So fun yet weird!,"My only complaint is that it was quite expensive for the size of the museum. Otherwise, I felt it was well laid out and very well executed. The figures are incredibly life like. Very fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CaronM674
40,Great Place To See,Great time to view all the life-like wax sculptures and take photos with all the past and present celebs.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rjtd83
40,Musicians and Movie Stars!,"This was a cool place to visit and is next door to Grauman's Chinese Theater. Right outside there is a giant Shrek that was popular for kids (and adults) to take pictures. You'll take an elevator to the third floor and proceed down level by level to see the exhibit. The wax figures are scattered around each floor. Some will make you do a double take because they're so lifelike. There is a Marvel Superhero section in addition to the normal musicians and movie stars. Some of the picture taking opportunities are more interactive. For example, a background where it appears you are upside down hanging from the ceiling with Spider-Man. Near the end is a section on how they make the wax figures which is actually interesting and they have an interactive station setup with wax. Overall, it's a bit expensive for a large family but fun to check out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dchang1978
40,WORTH A LOOK,"Not as good as the Madame Tussauds in London but worth a look if you are in the area and like wax museums. I know, raving review, right? It's a wax museum. You either like them or not. I don't think there are undecided wax museum people out there. Madame Tussauds is the best at realistic figures. I just wish there was more variety at the Hollywood location. Buy tickets online and save. Or find a coupon. If you're in the Hollywood/Highland area, it's not the worst 'attraction' in the area. I do have an endorsement of another attraction in the area...the Hollywood Museum. I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheatreScott
50,too realistic for words!,"The waxworks here are extremely realistic! And its brilliant that you can interact with them and get right up close, tho no touching the face or hair! The green screen pictures you can have taken throughout the venue are worth buying. Id go for the VIP package so you get all the pics printed, plus you can download them onto your own computer, etc. A fun few hours for all the family! Oh and if you dare, get a wax of your own hand done!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traceychu911
40,Better than I thought it would be,I went into Ripley's Believe it or not first we were NOT impressed which made me not really want to go into Madame Tussuads but I'm glad I did it was WAYYYYYY better than Ripley's. All of the wax figures were life like and it was cool to see how tall all the celebrities actually are. The exhibits are very interactive and make for cool pics,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/djkBuf
20,Not worth it,The entrance ticket is quite expensive. The wax figures were not that well made. The only interesting is that in every figure they have some itneresting facts about their lives and their career. Other than that I don't believe it deserves the 30$ admission ticket.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sophieasl
30,Madame Tussauds Hollywood,"Great place! Not as many figures as Las Vegas, but a nice display. Would have liked to bought the pictures, but there was only 1 girl working, and line was backed up, so never even got to view them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KCE1994
50,Fun for all ages,"Honestly, I love this place. It doesn't quite live up to the Vegas location but it's still fun for kids and myself. A little chilly but it has to be so it's great for a hot day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/663mishelleb
50,Very cool and well done,This place is very clean and the people working there are very nice. The wax figures are so real looking. We kept taking pictures of them constantly. Funny how the height of people is not what you expect.Triple Forks Hunting,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tripleforkshunting
50,Nice Wax Museum,This location is by far the best one. Alot of interactive stations with the wax Museum. Including dressing up sitting down with props.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/livelifeh2014
40,Buy your tickets online and save money!,"Purchased our tickets online the day of our visit and they offered an upgrade to get your own wax mold of your hand which was really cool. These are normally $17 if you purchase at the place, but online they were $5.Many of these wax figures look so real it's kind of creepy, but amazing at the same time. Some are better than others but Betty White, Bruce Willis, and Steven Speilberg seemed incredibly real.Each room is themed some old western, some pop singers, etc. There is something for everyone here. We went through the entire thing in about an hour, stopping for pictures with a lot of the figurines. The wax molding of your hand takes about 15 minutes each, so if there is a line, count how many people are in front of you and multiply it by 15 because that is how long you will be waiting. If you are 4th in line, expect to wait an hour. You get the idea.Anyway, I would have liked to have seen more figurines, not to say there are not a lot, I just wanted to see more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/timsK9162LG
30,"Expected to see more current stars, and more in general","This location seems small (compared to the Orlando location we've visited before), and I was somewhat disappointed by the lineup of figures here. I understand they want to celebrate Hollywood history, but there should be more current stars too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christophercB7504LW
50,A must see in Hollywood,"This was awesome to see and a lot of fun! Pretty cool to be able to take lots of ""set up"" pictures. They encourage it and there is no hassle. Really had a fun time and would recommend for both adults and kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/384stephenj
50,good day,"we had a lot of fun at the museum i went specially to see Selena and shes beautiful i love her purple outfit specially her boots !! i wish i could buy those boots ..we took pictures with all the artists and staff was very helpful ,thank you",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/460selener
50,Amazing and something to see at least once,It is amazing that they look really real and my kids loved having photos with each of them and posing with them.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tamrenzo1
50,100% Recommended!,This was my first time going to a wax works museum and I loved it! All the figures were so cool and most of them actually looked real. It was a great experience and I recommend it to anyone whose visiting Hollywood and loves celebrities of all kinds. Amazing!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/415tahliar
50,Excellent place,"Have visited Hollywood wax museum as well and would rate this better of the 2.The wax figures here look more realistic for the most part. The 4D movie experience is very cool and good for a visit.Buy your tickets online for the best value, we got the ultimate package and saved about $100 off the wall up price and these were purchased the morning before we left the hotel, so you could stand on the street outside and buy your tickets online and save some money.Very entertaining with lots of photo ops available to interact with the figures",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Daz233
50,Very Cool Attraction,"This attractions is probably one of top attractions in the city. It really has life like wax statues of most of your favorite celebrities. My tip would be to do this attraction first in the morning when it opens. If you wait later, you may end up seeing a line wrapped around the corner of the building.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bluehova
40,"Fun day out, however was suprised not more stars were featured.",We had a fun day out here taking photos with the models. We especially enjoyed the props which are provided to help with taking pictures with the star models. The photos which the staff take on your way around the building are great (they always do turn out good when you have to pay for them lol) but very extortionate. On the way round when you are offered pictures by the staff with E.T and on the crime board for example don't be shy to ask the staff to also take the pictures on your phone along with on their cameras too because they was more than happy to do so and saved us having to purchase them at the end.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hubblesr
30,Somewhere to waste an hour,Really just another wax museum. Some of the models were very life like. Didn't spend much time here as i found it a bit boring. Seen one you seen them all,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shirleykearney
50,Better Than Expected,"It was awesome! I was with my college graduate in LA for a week. This was my gift to him so I was up for doing the things he was interested in. Madame Tussauds Hollywood became a very unexpected delight. While my son was excited about being photographed with Anthony Hopkins I was sitting at a table having Breakfast at TIffanys with Audrey Hepburn. They encourage photo taking and even have props likes hats, boas, and allow you to sit in a car from Grease to have your picture taken with John Travolta. There were so many life like characters I found myself pretending to kiss Jack Nicholson in a photo-op and my son was making me take picture after picture of him with Quentin Tarrantino and Steven Spielberg. One last thing, make sure you get one of the many coupons/discounts offered in the hotels magazine and attraction racks.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/267kar
50,Madam Tussauds is Fun,"I typically do not like touristy stuff, but was pleasantly surprised at how fun this place is. There are props allowing you to have so much fun taking pictures. It is definitely worth checking it out",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ellend708
50,They look so real,"I have been two other Madame Tussauds wax museums before, and each one has its own unique and interesting qualities, and just like the others this one is fantastic. They look so real you could almost believe they're going to come to life. This one focuses on having movie stars in the famous roles they played. I had so much fun taking pictures with them and I'm always surprised how tall or short certain movie stars or famous people are.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gumballa1
50,Really good,"Used our GO LA card to visit, the GO LA card is well worth getting btw.Never been to a Tussauds before so not sure if they are all the same but we were surprised that you were allowed to touch the exhibits, they do ask that you don't touch the face or hands. In quite a few places you are encouraged to interact with the wax works.Really enjoyed the visit and would recommend if you are in the area. There is a very convenient underground parking garage in the next street.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alex965
50,Madame tousssards,"A must for everyone, they cater for every one. Well set out with extra visuals to keep with the settings and stats",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/128lynettea
30,Amazing Models,"My 16yr old and I found this easily, right beside Chinese Theatre on Hollywood Boulevard, which was a big plus, and the models are amazing!! I kept turning around to see if they were really an actor about to tap us on the shoulder and say ""Boo!!!"". But beside taking photos with the models, which didn't interest my photo-avoidant teen, there wasn't much to do. Not our favourite Hollywood experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LateBloomer69
20,Long wait for wax hand souvenir,"Waited over an hour in the line to get a waxed hand done, and still didnt get it as there were still 2 people in front of me and I had to leave then,as my son was getting irritable waiting in the small crowded room. The ladies behind the counter were very slow and spent more time chatting to each other. Very disappointing as I had paid in advance but didnt get it done!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lauradunn2016
40,Madame Tussauds!,Having never been to a wax museum I really had no idea what to expect. It was pretty entertaining however we went after 5 so it was only $15. Honestly I wouldn't pay much more then that. There were a lot of figures and I took pictures of most of them I had an interest in. I think they did a pretty good job of spreading it out over decades of famous people. They had lots of older movie stars and shows and things like that but I would say the majority were probably more modern. Overall it was an awesome place to visit and right on Hollywood Blvd! Check out the after 5 tickets and get them cheap purchasing online!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dazyabbey
50,Super funny place! You'll have lots of fun!,"The MT Hollywood wax museum it's awesome. It has all the ""lights and shine"" of hollywood for sure. You'll have a great time here, it's a blast!Not all the Madame Tussauds Wax Museums have the same figures but this has awesome pieces and the settings are perfect to take great pictures. Check the props near some of the figures for a complete movie style/look. All figures look almost real, no defects or exaggerated qualities, they did a terrific job. It worth the money and the time.I think it's better to come in group so you can play with the space and take good photos, not only selfies.They also take pictures of you in special places so you can purchase those at the end. They are a bit expensive but they add some special frames and background so it is not that bad.Now they have a great 4D attraction of the Marvel's Avengers so check it before you leave, it's really funny.If you need parking you can check one ""public"" parking space right in the corner of the museum at N Orange Drive, it's around $15 until 2am so pretty much the whole day and it's located beneath the museum (it's not part of the museum)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChoxU
50,A Pure Laughing Blast of Fun,This is one of the best one's I have been to and the characters are so life like....we had a blast taking pictures and so smart to put out props to wear with some of the stars like Rocky and thor....awesome,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JasonJ847
50,Fantastic wax museum!,I loved this musem. It is the best Madame toussads I have been to. The figures are so lifelike. They EV.en have props next to some of the figures that you can use to take a picture. This museum is definitely worth the admission fee,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rich122014
40,Worth a visit,We enjoyed this attractionSome models are better than othersVery surprised in sporting greats they have the disgraced Lance Armstrong,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/235trevorl
40,Didn't expect to enjoy it this much,"We went here mainly because it was one of the choices on the LA GO Card, and because we had a small gap in our schedule and wanted to do something that wouldn't take long. We really had a good time. The art of the wax replicas was so impressive. Many of them looked very much like the real thing. Even the ones that didn't necessarily look much like the star still looked real. The best part was that we got to pose with and hug and interact with the wax statues, as long as we didn't touch their faces. My kids had so much fun dancing with Michael Jackson and getting knocked out by Rocky, and riding a bike with ET, etc... We had a great time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/juliathegr82
40,It was pretty fun,Great place to take selfies with a celebrity. It was part of our LA Go card so we went.If you haven't been before it is worth the visit. My kids really enjoyed it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kristinetracy
40,KMA Sees Wax,"I am always interested in going to museums, but this was a different experience. There were not as many wax figures of the stars as I thought there would be. Of the wax star figures that were there, only a few actually looked like the person they were supposed to be, they did not do such a good job with some of them to the point that we had to actually look at the plaque to figure out who the wax figure was supposed to be. The sad thing is when you finished going through it, guess what? You ended up in the gift shop with an opportunity to pay for the picture(s) that they took of you at the green screen in the beginning of your tour of the wax museum. My advice, if you want to go and see it once, it is OK. Just remember that that you may not recognize some of the stars, and not a lot of the stars are there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KarenA126
20,disappointed,we took our grandkids to Madame Tussaunds and it was not worth it. They don't have a lot of wax figures and it is very seedy. It was not worth the money.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melodiel534
40,Nice Place to capture selfies with stars !,"Good Place to visit,went there and clicked many pictures there,Also I got 10$ discount coupon just outside the Madame Tussauds street.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/399debashreec
40,Ok....,"The three-story museum was under construction for eight years before finally opening. It features 115 wax figures of famous celebrities - the first ones made for the location were of singer Beyoncé Knowlesand actor Jamie Foxx, at a cost of approximately $300,000 (USD) each. Each wax figure has its own placard placed on a wall in close physical proximity to it, containing information about the portrayed figure. A few matching props have been placed near select figures for visitors to use while taking photos.The biggest figure in the museum is of Shrek. The figure is plastic in composition, however, as it is placed outside each day to attract passersby.Joining Shrek near the entrance are one or two other figures, kept in the shade as they are made of wax. Marilyn Monroe, Lucille Ball and Johnny Depp are among some of the figures used in the lobby to entice guests to enter the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/578antonellom

40,Fun place,Definitely a beat place to visit. You can see all kinds of stars. They are so life like also. Family friendly. It's also close to shops n restaurants,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tonygA443LN
40,Well Worth the Visit,"Great experience, worth the money. Most of the figures are very real looking. They have costumes and accessories you can put on and take pics with the figures, very fun. We had a great time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Debbiea9793
40,nice visit,"i would recommence this activity. normally its not my kind of thing, but it was interesting to be able to participate in the scenes et take pictures. by example, sitting on the bike with ET, boxing with Rocky, etc",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alysd2018
30,Nice but too short,Madam Tussauds is always a fun experience and this one is no exception. You can get discount tickets from people giving them away in Hollywood boulevard so make sure you receive one of those before you arrive to the museum. If you decide to visit take into a count that it is a fun but very short visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NatalyGrisales
40,Worth the visit,We went on a Saturday afternoon. Didn't have to wait in line and the crowds weren't bad. The figures are well done and over all a fun experience. My teenage daughter also enjoyed it,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CeciliaB784
40,Enjoyed it very much,We bought tickets on line but when we got there guys were offering coupons on the street for the same price. The line was long for will call and there were 4 people behind the counter doing nothing. We finally got our tickets and went in. We enjoyed the wan museum. Totally worth the $20.00 we paid. Most of the statueslooked liked the actors. If your in the areait's worth going to.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jharris57
40,Tourist Central,The Wax Museum is always packed with tourist.... did it ONCE and will probably never do it again.... wax replica's are only soooo entertaining.... You have realize it's L.A.!!! There are 9 Million other things to so and do....,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidpR4816AS
30,Give it a Whirl,"If you've been to one Madame Tussaud's you've been to them all. It's a wax museum of celebrities that allows you the opportunity to take photos and have a little fun while doing so. Many of the wax figures look too real, like freakish real so don't freak out. If you've never visited a Madame Tussaud's, definitely give it a whirl and don't forget the camera",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WeAdoreTravl

40,Nice :),"We visited here late and night, which was good because we got to take a lot of pictures!! There are not many stars here. More like Obama, Demi, Lavato and a bunch of oldies. If you want to take pictures with the newer generation of stars i suggest going to the Madame Tussauds in London and NYC. Amust see place!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Anisa_flower
50,Amazing,Beautiful lifelike sculptures with a nice background setting for great pictures. It is also a perfect rest day after a hectic few days at DisneyLand and Universal Studios.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnkurTrivedi
40,Very Cool,My kids and I loved this place. It was neat to see how talented some people are - some of the wax figures look real!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelnmom31
30,fine if you need an activity,"There are not many sites and touristy things to do in LA. If you need a touristy activity for teens or some other reason to say that you've ""been to Hollywood"", this wax museum is fun - but very expensive for what it is.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lizo80
50,THIS IS A MUST DO - IT'S FUN,"This is real fun - while getting close up to the stars looking them up close in the eye you really expected them laugh or move as they are so life like, had photos done with all of them, some even had clothing props you could slip on like western to be part of the theme a must do and very inexpensive $29 US for adult don't forget if you are a senior let it be known for cheaper tickets",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adequate5510
50,Bring your camera - photos are allowed!,"Even though many people enter the wax museum it doesn't feel crowded and you can walk wherever you please. Three floors of real-life looking celebrities. Lady Gaga, Tom Hanks from Forrest Gump, Marilyn Monroe, and Michael Jackson! Give yourself 2 hours to see them all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fromjessicaskitchen
40,"Had some fun with the ""stars""","My wife and I stopped by here while waiting for a wedding reception later that night. We had fun taking our pictures up close and personal with the ""stars"". It was worth doing once but that will probably be the last.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rodneyj339
50,Fun Time,Had a great time. Worth every penny.. Better than I thought it would be. 90 percent of statues looked real. Taking pictures with them was fun. Great for all ages. Would go back again.NY Vistors,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/968elleng
40,A fun touristy thing to do,"If you are down in Hollywood hitting all the trendy sites, you need to see Madame Tussauds. It is fun to visit and take pictures with ""the stars"". There are also so many other things to see in the area, so take a full day to explore the entire area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/83deedeeu
50,The figures are so life like,"I enjoyed walking through this museum and being able to touch the figures and pose with them was so much fun. the 4D mini movie was fantastic, I truly felt like I was right in the action. I went solo and it was tough taking pictures go with friends or make sure you have a selfie stick if you go solo",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adelasiad2016
40,Very good.,"I've been to the one in Berlin and London before, and this was the same standard as always. Great setup. Not as big as the other ones, but have enough to see. So much fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mariiabak
50,Best in the world,Been lucky to visit a few Madame Tussauds around the world but this is the best! Much bigger and better celebrities than other locations.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vessy67
50,Excellent,"I visited with my 12 year old son. This place was extraordinary. It is well designed that you are captivated through a talented blending of videos, artifacts, displays, and layout. Very well worth it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JamLam3
40,Very good and worth the visit for the photos,Enjoyed our visit visit to a madame tussauds at hollywood walk of fame. didnt really fancy it myself but was dragged in by the mrs. thoroughly enjoyed it and took some great photos with the stars for the family album. was someone for eveyone and all ages in there. glad we gave it a go,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tonywilson77
40,Great!,"The wax figures are incredibly lifelike and totally cool. Worth the price of $30 per person. (If you walk around Hollywood Blvd there are usually people handing out coupons, take them, they work!) we scored a 50% coupon at the Hard Rock Cafe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ge0rjannam
50,Hollywood Sight Seeing,Wife and I visited the museum and thoroughly enjoyed it. Many wax figures that were very lifelike. Have opportunists to take photos with and of the figures.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C2712HPwilliamk
40,Touristy but fun,This wax museum right on Hollywood Blvd. is the pinnacle of touristy but actually fun. Most of the wax sculptures are extremely life like but a few miss the mark. I really enjoyed the layout which allows you to interact with the sculptures and take great photos. Don't confuse it with the Hollywood wax museum - there are two. A quick and fun visit. Get the LA GO pass for discounts.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HBerke
30,Not All Life-Like,"Three floors of current and stars dating back to silent movie era. Props near some that you can wear while posing. Lots of room between each so you don't feel crowded while posing with wax figure. Some didn't really look as we expected, and others not very life-like. Walked thru fairly quickly and done in an hour. Ended with a 4D film before shuffled out into the gift shop. Tip: use the restroom before going into 4D film otherwise you're outside the museum without re-entry. Bit expensive for what it was.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/herculesmom
50,So much fun for my kids,"I was a bit skeptical, but we decided to take our 4 kids (8,11,13,15) to this place. It turned out to be the highlight of our vacation. My kids must have snapped 1000 pics in that place and posted so many to Instragram. And my favorite photo is my herd of kids standing in the police lineup. Now I must add that I have a few drama kids, so photos is there thing. But even my sporty kid had blast snapping pics. Definitely a family time to remember. We did go first thing in the morning to avoid the crowds. We arrived early and walked the streets to look at the stars before entering.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PDXfam6
40,Funner than You Would Expect,"When the idea of going to a wax museum was presented to me, I was not thrilled at the idea. However, after getting there, it was a blast! Having a group that is willing to interact with the statues, dress up in provided costumes, and be silly is key to a fun adventure. Give yourself at least an hour and half to truly experience the attraction. Also, try to prebook or package the tickets with other offers to safe a few dollars!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hjk1648
50,Well worth a visit!,"We prebooked our visit before we left the UK. We got a discounted rate which gave us front of line passes as well as a wax model of our hand to take away with us. (Please note that the kids might not enjoy the wax model thing - it involves putting your hand in ICE COLD water for 30 secs and it stings, my 5 year old ended up crying and my 10 year old decided against doing it).We arrived for the place opening as we wanted to make sure it wasn't too busy. There were a couple of large groups there but our passes let us go directly to the front. The models themselves are incredible and, just like the other Madame Tussaud's attractions throughout the world, you are encouraged to take selfies. There are props there to help with you photos and I was on cloud 9 when I got to sit in the actual Greased Lightning car used in the movie Grease with my Pink Ladies jacket on! There are LOADS of models there and it is always fascinating to see how tall/small the actors/entertainers are in real life! The icing on the cake was the Superheroes exhibition - Thor, Wolverine, Iron Man....then the 4D show really rounded our visit off nicely. I felt like I was part of the Marvel gang helping Hulk smash up his enemies :0)10 out of 10!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Scotsgirl73
40,Vacation,Not as awesome as the one in London UK. Definately fun to visit with teenagers of all ages and worth the time spent.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/599kristinh
50,A Memorable And Worthwhile Visit,My wife and I loved the Hollywood version of Madam Tussauds.We knew virtually every figure and being able to stand or sit next to each one for photos was a bonus we did not expect.It might only take an hour or so to look around but I recommend it if in Hollywood and you have the time to spare.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GrantP869
50,Life Like!!!,"I didn't know how the kids will feel about this place, but they loved it. There are props for you to take photographs with the wax figures. They are so real looking. It was amazing to me!! Will do it again in another city!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Npmrmom
40,Good times,Vitied in August after 6pm on a deal. Been here before and enjoyed the last visit so thought we would come again and the same models are pretty much still there and not changed but still a fun way to spend a couple of hours and get some photos taken,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PaulH80
30,Don't go unless you have a friend that takes pictures,"We went on a Sunday afternoon to see the museum. It was busy, but not overcrowded. The parking was expensive - $20. The streets were crowded, so were the sidewalks. The figures were all well crafted. There was another group taking TOTALLY cool photos and having a great time. No one in my party wanted to take photos and so, this was kind of time and money wasted for me. Yeah, I saw it but I only have a couple pics. I did get one with Captain Kirk, William Shatner! But it was him from the movie, not the original TV series. I thought Snoop Dog was the best one. SO REAL.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LAtoEverywhere
10,"When there a year ago, it sucked. Overpriced and boring.",My family wanted to go there. I didn't but went anyway. It cost a lot and was boring. The parking nearby was expensive too. The neighborhood is scary and dirty.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SteveinLACa
40,Most realistic wax figures in LA/Hollywood,"Madame Tussauds says it all! Most realistic wax figures in the world, this location does not disappoint. I visited multiple time each time there's something new to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LizDelSol
30,Same Old Same Old,It was a fun break from the crowds on Hollywood Blvd but nothing spectacular. It's no different than other wax museums. Worth a visit if you're never been to place like this before.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CPINSL
40,Pretty cool,"I'd been here before but my husband was interested so we went again - it's a fun attraction but not something i'll ever need to do again. Its great if your favourite people are in there, makes for great photos!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/642paiges
40,We loved it,"We arrived from Australia and wen straight to Hollywood Blvd to see some sights. My son (15) and I had a ball. We loved getting our pictures taking with the ""stars"" and having props at different areas to use with the stars was fun. A little bit pricey but fun to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tashaevans
40,like the others,Nice place to visit. If you have been to the one in Manhattan it's very much the same. If you don't know any it's worth visiting.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Trindade74
40,Fun way to spend an hour or so but try to get discount vouchers!,"While walking down the Walk of Fame, some guy thrusted some discount vouchers for Mme Tussaud's in my hands. Normally they go straight into the bin but these offered 50% discount, nothing to be sniffed at in my book.Without the discount I would have felt a bit shortchanged because it isn't a very big exhibit. It was blissfully quiet and cool inside so that was a plus and many of the wax statues have props next to them so you can act like a total plonker and be ""in"" the scene with your favorite movie star.As a big Star Wars fan I missed characters from my beloved franchise but i guess they're all in London now. The Avengers 4D cinema bit was distracting for a good 15 minutes but nothing special.Like I said, paying full price will leave you disappointed because of the size af the 'museum' but at 50% off, it was a very pleasurable passtime.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GerryD90
40,Liked it!,We had a lot of fun here and it was great to see ourselves standing next to celebrities and comparing our height and size to them.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/8jane8
40,Celebrities galore!,"Very nice Madame Tussauds branche. It's always fun at Madame Tussauds but in my opinion there is a lot of difference between the branches. Hollywood is (of course) a celebritie galore! Tens of opportunities to take a hpoto or selfie with you favorite artist, movie star etc. Would definitely recommend visiting. Get the online late night saver for $18!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ben_1985_02
10,Too much money for nothing special!!,"We are there, this is worst thing at L.A.!! Too much expensive for nothing special! They dont have that much acctress singers etc like they have at London. And they are still expensive!! Bad choice!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kurkuma2000
40,It's worth a look...,"The lay out is fun and with plenty of space to not fall over anyone. Some are so real looking you almost apologise if you walk too close.... There is a photographer and everyone tries to keep out of the way hahahahah..... You get a photo at the beginning, which unfortunately I forgot about..You can also get a wax mould of your own hand done for a nominal cost.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/569adellel
30,Small,For the price I thought it would be bigger. Loved the hands on but very small and not enough displays. Three floors but not enough to figures,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/french5029
50,Cool!!!,"Very nice experience, we took a lot of funny picts with our favorites singers and actors. You really enjoy your time!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YanaraSosa
40,Pretty Cool!,"This was a great time to take many pictures with your favorite ""celebrity"". So worth the visit while visiting LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mrs-Mia2016
50,So much fun!!,I had so much fun at Madame Tussaud's Hollywood!! There are so many of my favourite stars and they looked so real. Definitely worth a visit!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Samantha_Lea_Sherry
40,Fun,We got free tix to museum after purchasing the celebrity tour guide. It was in a great location and had a lot of my fave wax figures. We also got to enjoy a marvel 3d movie inside. There is a gift shop next door that offered a lother of items for under $5. I was able to purchase many souvenirs without breaking the bank,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/N7629ZHmonicad
50,Fun,"I have passed by these all over the world and never experienced them! But in LA my granddaughters wanted to go, so we went.I had as much fun in them as they did. So interactive with props!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/granniedish
30,"OK for a rainy day, but a shame to miss out of REAL Hollywood right outside.","We got free tickets to Madame Tussauds with our City Sightseeing bus tickets so thought we'd pop in and take a look. It's an interesting hour or so mooching about, and impressive to see how much detail the wax figures have. I've also been told that Madame Tussauds is more life like than other similar attractions (though I don't have experience of this), but I guess it depends what you're after. Had we not had free tickets I certainly wouldn't have spent the money on the admission and don't think it really represents good value for money, though there was an exhibit about how the wax models were made which was quite interesting.I guess if you have kids who really want to go, or you've always been interested (it's worth visiting a wax museum at least once in your life!) or maybe it's a rainy day or even you want to get some celeb spotting done whilst in tinsel town but have been unlucky so far, then by all means pop in. However it seems a shame to be inside looking at wax when the whole of LA is right there for you to explore!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StraightOutOfKansas
50,Must see,"Great exhibit, attentive staff and affordable tickets. So many great pictures were taken here. Definitely one of the best tourist attractions to visit when you are in LA. It did not disappoint.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anaelysb2016
50,Fun visit,"We spent couple fun hours at the museum including an explanation of how and how and a short 4D movie. It was nice and fun, took pictures with the wax figures (though not the best models to pose by) and just had fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tipforgoodtrip
30,"Was fun, I thought Hollywood would have more",Being the hub of celebrities I thought I would go to my first Madame Tussauds for the best experience. It was a lot of fun taking stupid photos with stars and characters from all eras. Being a Marvel Comics fan the Avengers area was great.I was a little key down but the number of sculptures. It seemed a little sparse for a location on the Walk of Fame. The bonus was that as we exited it was right in time to see Michael Keaton get his star on the footpath.Maybe worth a visit but not for the expense.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tobyv104
50,Much more fun than you would think,"I lived in LA for many years and had never been. Decided to do it for a family birthday adventure. Was SO fun!!! You get to see the life size of the stars. (Who knew Rhianna was that tall?!) Get photo ops. Very enjoyable! It is not that crowded when you get inside, even in the summer. I've now taken friends who visit a few times. I enjoy it every time. Just have to do it once in your life! Well worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/catherinet115
20,Ah it was alright,"My wife and I had not planned to attend the Madame Tussaud's Hollywood wax museum- however upon getting a discount from a tour that is apparently owned by the same company, we went ahead and visited this attraction.Having visited a Madame Tussaud's Wax museum in Washington DC (which we loved) we had high hopes for the Hollywood edition. However there were few wax figures comparatively. Most of the wax figures were all in a big black room together and there were no backdrops or settings - like there were in DC for nearly every figure. This made it much less of an interactive and fun experience and more of a boring walk-look- and go attraction. If you want to pay top dollar to quickly go through a room of wax figures then this is the attraction for you. If you want a memorable and fun experience, try the DC location.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jsorrell92
50,Feel Like a Star,"Never have visited Madame Tussauds and it was something on the bucket list and what better way to do it than in Hollywood!For the moment you walk in have your camera in your hand and get ready to start taking lots of pictures, there are many sections so there is something for everyone it all starts with A List Party with stars of the present, Spirit of Hollywood with older stars, there are sections on Crime, Western, Modern Classics, Making Movies, Action Heroes, Pop Icons, Sports and Marvel Heroes. You will see wax figures on there own or some are set up in scene from a movie, a few scenes that were standouts Grease, Dirty Dancing, Forest Grump and getting on a bike with ET. I won't tell you everything as you will just have to discover it for yourself. But the wax figures are made so well it incredible as they are so life like.But the best part is just having fun, a tip for your photos use the props and just be a bit silly in your posing and your photos will turn out amazing. A great way to spend a few hours!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/torz70
40,Fun in Holywood,Use the internet to purchase tickets at a discount. Fun to take pictures with the celebrity figures and they have props to make it interesting. Best value is the after 6 ticket.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/angelahL4072OZ
40,BE SEEN WITH THE STARS,"My daughter and I popped in to Madame Tussauds as it was included in our GoCityCard. We only intended to pop in for half an hour or so but ended up staying over 90 minutes. There are several rooms including Pop Stars, Movie Stars, TV Stars and Directors. You are welcome to take photos as long as you don't touch the faces of the exhibits. Some exhibits look more lifelike than others. There are often discount vouchers on Groupon so it may be worth looking into if you are interested in checking out Madame Tussauds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annat150
40,Fun place!,Our teenagers loved this place. It is so well organized and we all had a lot of fun. We took lots of pictures of all the celebrities and our girls enjoyed the opportunity to make waxed molds of their hands.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JillLJones
50,weekend getaway,this is a great place to see the figures are so real. we had a blast didn't realize they exchange characters with there other museums. enjoyed seeing how and what went into making them,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sandraj780
50,Loved this place,"We thought this would be more for kids but we were wrong. Thoroughly enjoyed ourselves, although an older couple, the displays and settings were amazing and we took so many photos, it was great fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maureenf434
40,Nice and well organized,We went there without line at the entrance....maybe we were lucky or maybe this attraction is not so famous. It is placed on 3 floors and it's well organized. You can see most of the famous people but for sure some of them are missing. For teens it is perfect!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PaperogaArchimede
40,So Many Celebrities,Where can you go and get up close and take a picture with so many celebrities?! The family had a great time and everyone in the group took a ton of pictures. A must see on Hollywood Blvd.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeanieB0915
30,Good time for family,"Was part of our LA Go Pass, so felt might as well give it a try. Family had a really good time (my 13yr old daughter knew most of figures). First time for me to visit wax museum. Very impressed with how lifelike each appeared. Also fun to see how tall or short some of our celebrity favorites are. One drawback, we thought there were going to be more figures, but still enough for the entertainment. Took lots of pictures, since they encourage you to interact within scenes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/markcQ3100VN
50,Better than expected!!!,The wax figures are so real looking. I thought they were going to move at any minute. I would go again. Buy your tickets online they are cheaper.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/m0m24ca
30,Not as good as Bangkok version,"We were here for the walk of fame etc so paid a visit (was included in the LA go Pass ) was ok, but the Bangkok version is better. But if you are here go visit. it is quality.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BenHancock
40,"Worth the money, a MUST SEE!","So much fun. Bought tickets for the cheaper after 6pm special, not a lot of people and wax figures were so life like. Went with 8 year old and he loved it! Highly recommend it, plus got to see the sights of Hollywood Blvd.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jdressel1
40,Free Madame Tussauds,If you buy the 48hr Hop on Hop off bus ticket you get into Madame Tussauds free then it is worth it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/teressam2016
40,Not as freaky as I thought it would be,"We had this as an option on our Go Pass, so decided to give it a shot. The line to get in was a bit long and the elevators were confusing, but once we got in, it was okay. Some of the figures, as you might suspect, were not great likenesses -- to the point that you had to look at the wall sign to see who they were supposed to be. Some were in interesting poses and they have seats and props that you can use to ""interact"" with the figure. This is a GREAT photo opportunity if you are with friends and want a good laugh!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnsA1867KR
40,Wow......So Lifelike!,"We visited on a weekend so it was pretty busy. If you are planning to visit I would suggest a weekday when it might be quieter.The wax figures were so unbelievably lifelike, even up close.If you compose your photo's carefully you could probably say it was the real person .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mlewis66
30,Fun but overpriced,Worth doing once to experience. My teens were surprised out how lifelike some of the figures seem. Do feel it was overpriced for what you get.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vasportsmom
30,not worth the price,"There are many ways for you to interact with the wax figures and we visited when it wasn't too busy. However, for the price you pay, I would expect more wax figures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/txtravel021
50,Wax lyrical...,"We visited on a weekday, which I suggest is a good day. Less public and better opportunity to see all the exhibits.Make sure you get your hand dipped in wax as a memento.It's great fun!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/williame65water
30,Okay,"Some of the celebrities are unrecognizable. Theres few interesting though, like barrack or anthony hopkins.I thought it would really be amazing...but it was fun though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ellene_santos
40,Lots to see,"One of the better madame tussauds. We went 5 years ago and has been completely changed with new exhibits. Lots of fun can be had with the props and dress up costumes. They encourage interaction, apart from touching the faces. Good range of past and present actors/actresses and sports people.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SheilaM70
50,Star among the Stars on Hollywood Blvd,"Stand by your favorite star or stars and take your photo. Isn't it amazing how small of the actors are, but how much larger they look on screen! This is a fun place to go, but it's probably because it is on Hollywood Blvd were you can see the star plaques on the sidewalk, go to fun souvenir shops with postcards of stars, eat, shop, go to other museum. I love it because it's like an open air mall and everything is in this area so its not driving from one place to another. A bit like Universal Studios and Disney Land because you can spend days here with Madame Tussauds being one of your expected visits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Navigate00230422899
40,Very realistic!,"Love to visit these places, I'm always amazed at how realistic the figures are. I really like that there are props for when you take photos. Everyone else seemed to be having good time, also.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jollyone333
50,"Fun, fun, fun!!!","Me and my 10 year old daughter spent 2 very funny hours there! The statues looks so real, several times we would think it was a real person on our way!The museum has some hats and other props they encourage you to wear to interact with the statues and take pictures, really awesome! You can touch everything, except for the face and hair. There is also happy music playing all the time, it just adds up to the fun!The 4D movie with the Avengers was also fun!After the visit, time to search for the characters stars on the walk of fame, just there!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mtbaraujo
40,Meet the stars!,"We hadn't planned on going but we got a free ticket to the museum with our hop on hop off bus tickets and went when we had a bit of time spare. An interesting place, Madame Tussauds is very well done, lots of different areas with wax figures from TV, movies and sport. It is an interactive attraction where you can put on a Boa or a hat & take photos with the figures. Music specific to the figures you're looking at sets the scene, a wide variety on multiple levels the wax figures are very life like and the majority hit the mark of who they represent. Probably not something I'd pay to do but good none the less.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sm05060
50,They have all been good,"Whether in London, New York, or Los Angeles. All of the Madame Tussauds have been excellent! We took one teen granddaughter to London's and she loved it. We took another to the one in Hollywood and she loved it. We loved them too. All of them are different enough so that the adults enjoy each one. Bring your camera. Only complaint not enough superhero gifts to buy for younger kids",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FtWayne_INPam
40,Cool exhibits,"This is a fun tourist site to visit with people visiting Los Angeles. It's enjoyable and relaxing to walk through the museum and view/take pictures of and with, celebrity wax replicas.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelRobs
40,Spot the celebrity,"Had a good time spotting the stars, you can have your photo taken with whoever you like, old and new stars or even the President.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/78kevanr
50,GOOD DAY OUT,As expected the life like figures were good and very believable. Spent about 2 hr and that was enough.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wenzzzz
30,Expected more,The statues are close to perfection. Some are so real you can even think they are actually real.I think they should create better scenarios and put more statues.Don't miss the 4D cinema at the end. Really cool!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MRentel
40,Lots of fun,My husband and I decided to go to Madame Tussaud's tonight after spending the day touring LA.It's definitely a lot of fun with great photo opportunities all around. There are 3 stories of exhibits and you are welcome to get up close to the exhibits as long as You don't touch their face or hair. They even provide the odd prop for you to use in photos too. We went at about 6pm and it was busy but not too bad.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/estherjcgs
50,Get there early!,"I got there just as it opened and it was completely empty, such a good time to look round without the crowds! They have props there for photo opportunities and a very wide range of wax models. Cheap too! I got free entry by buying a 48 hour hop-on-hop-off bus ticket!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sophie1988_06
50,What a blast!!,"This was my first time visiting Madame Tussaud's. We purchased tickets online ahead of time and saved a ton of time skipping the line.The wax figures are very realistic looking. Some were definitely better than others. You are able to use props and pose with the figures which I thought was fun.We spent a little over an hour going through the 3 floors. There are areas that the staff will take pictures throughout with the option to buy at the end. Pictures were great, prices were steep.Fun time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michelewelker

40,Very good lots of fun,"This is great fun, lots of faces to see, i like the marvel attraction at the end however the room is a little dirty which made me feel queesy, but great fun to go and do for a hour or so",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/912ashleae
40,Better than expected!,"Kids begged to go. Got 50% off tickets on the street, so was affordable. It was a lot more enjoyable than I expected.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AllisonB2208
50,So real,The figures looked so real and you are able to get up close and take pictures with them. Was not too crowded so easy to get to everything. Buy your tickets online to attend after 7:00 and it's half price.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M1988GGsandys
50,Life like,We had a great time here. There was 3 floors with different areas. Each area had several people. They are very life like. They have props with some that you can use to take pictures with.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/83rogerw
50,Absolutely brilliant - a must see.,"We had a great time taking photos / posing with the wax figures....if you line-up the eye-line of the wax figures into your camera, the resultant pictures look so realistic. The movie is an absolute must....very entertaining. Overall, Madame Tussauds is a great experience and quite entertaining.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/248grega
30,ok,I have been to the wax museum in Las Vegas Twice and loved it. I found that this one didnt have as much and I preferred the hollywood wax museum over it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/matthewcV2456IZ
50,"Great fun, a must do!","Thought this would be a marginal activity, but my daughter wanted to do it. OMG, this was great fun! Strongly recommend. Wax figures amazingly realistic. A great way to experience a variety of Hollywood history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BestTravelsNow
40,Very Realistic!,"This was a neat place to see. We had so much fun posing with the wax figures! I liked how they were set up with cool displays and props. But we were disappointed that Katniss was missing from her display. My only complaint was getting inside. We had the pre-purchased Go Cards, but still had to wait in line for printed tickets. Although there were several employees hanging around, only one was actually working a register. So we had to wait for everyone one in front of us to purchase their tickets, before we could get in. It seems like they could have had a different line to scan the cards, or open ALL the registers until the line was gone. Of all the places we visited using the Go Cards, this was the only place we had a problem.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jans778
40,Good but overprjced,Thought that this was a 'must do'. The wax figures were amazing but it was pretty underwhelming for how much we paid to get in.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mrsneidert
30,"Okay, but not worth $$","We saw a deal only that after 6 pm tickets are $18 but you have to get it online. At the door we paid nearly 59 something for 2 people.The online prices are better deals but still pricey for the exhibit.Overall it was a nice experience, but I could tell some wax figures were missing.. so makes me wonder what I missed out on. It's very interactive which is nice but wouldn't visit it again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Valerwee
40,Some Of The BEST Wax Figures I've Ever Seen!,"What a pleasant surprise!! By far one of the most realistic wax figures I've ever seen. This place is laid out really well, so visitors can ""mingle"" among the figures and take close-up pictures. There are props in every room, so you can become ""part of the scene"" with the figures. LOVED IT!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VanEsq12
40,Very realistic; like you are really standing with the celebs,Tons of pictures with celebs; top floor is a nightclub. You are even allowed to touch the wax figures.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/phancyp
50,Nothing but amazing!!,It's an incredible place to visit... I spent hours and hours there... took pics with almost all figures... Staff were nice and welcoming...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mariastockler
50,So Life like. Not as many wax figures as we expected,I suggest that you buy a LA GoCard off the internet before you go. This was $29.95 per person. We had a large group and planned to spend all day in this area. Found LA GOCARDS on internet and purchased a One Day Pass for $79.00. We were able to do 5 different places or tours and saved us over $150.00 each All within walking distance.The figures were so lifelike that when we got off the elevator we waited for the person to finish taking a picture... Little did we know it was a Wax Figure... Yep that real.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lorisreview
50,What a treat!,"I am a grown up in my mid 30's and had a great time. I could hardly stop closing my mouth, it was so brilliant. The figures are really well made, almost out of the movies..... Money well spent on this one",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/384renatan
50,Great Visit,Went here on my last day of travel to Los Angeles. Toured this attraction solo and was able to get a coupon for $10 off. had some really good wax figures my favorite had to be Forest Gump! will visit again with family.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/863cieraw
40,Strike a Pose!,"I was not expecting to have so much fun here, I thought it was just going to be walking around looking at was figures but we really had a lot of fun dressing up and using the props and posing with the celebs! I loved it here! You don't need to spend too much time here, just enough to snap some pics. We got in using our Go LA passes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cloudpunch
50,Lovely atmosphere,"Great place to visit, when we went it wasn't too busy so we had a great time looking at all the celebrities and taking photos. Our first Madame Tussauds and it did not disappoint at all!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LilyHarris
50,Not the Wax Museum that I remember....,"For years my family has wanted to go to a wax museum....""forget it"" I'd say...they're boring....""looking at wax figures from velvet ropes from 10 feet away isn't much fun guys"".....Well....we did the hop on hop off bus with the additional fee to get into the museum....WOW HAVE THINGS CHANGED!!!!Now you pose with the wax figures....get right up next to them....go ahead and touch them....completely different....and a shocking amount of fun!It's a nice trip down memory lane to see some of your favorite characters over the years....and be reminded of some of their greatest moments.Bring your camera and have a ball....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RoadWarriorXten
30,Cool but not quite worth it,"We had a Go Card so we didn't pay admission. Although I enjoyed the exhibit and it was fascinating to see these works of art but we did leave feeling agreeing we were glad we didn't pay for it. I think you'd have to be a really big Hollywood and celebrity buff to really feel satisfied with the value.I can't fault the work though, it's beautiful and takes real craftsmanship, was interesting to see how they were made too. However I think some of the newer celebrities look a little 'better' just perhaps because they've continued to perfect their craft over the years.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Marcimo_NZ
50,Crazy Real Figures Housed in an Exhibit with lots to Learn!,"We couldn't get over the realism that all the figures expressed. I found it particularly neat to read about the process and time it takes in the last part of the experience. The timeline of Tussaud's life and approach to her artistic craft was also really interesting. There were additionally very cool collectibles and historical artifacts there as well like the guilotine blade that beheaded Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette, Napolean's pocket watch, and so on. It really put things in context, despite the pop culture feel of the main display rooms, that Tussaud was a real person who lived during that period. It was neat to see the real height and likeness when it came to the more modern celebrities. I also really liked the relaxed atmosphere of the place, and the freedom to take fun photos and even touch the figures (but not the faces or hair, were the only restrictions). It's also handily situated around other key L.A. sights like the TCL Chinese Theatre, a section of the walk of fame, the El Capitan theatre and others.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/788joshuaj
50,Mesmerizing...,We have been in LA 3 times in the last 9 years and we go here at every trip. Every time they offer something different. We had an amazing deal at travelzoo for 37$ for two tickets and two wax hands souvenirs plus the catalog ($6). My daughter is now 13 and she enjoys its visit at it is the first time. It is a must visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IngridHA1973
40,So much fun,"We have visited Madame Toussad's Hollywood a couple of times, and always enjoy. The wax figures are quite lifelike and posed so you can take great pictures with them. A number of the figures have props you can use to further enhance your pictures. We found discounted tickets through work, which made it a great value.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AZFamilyOf4
40,Enjoyed this museum!!!,Enjoyed this museum!!! They didn't have as many wax figures as I thought they would have...some people that I thought should be featured there wasn't!!! Very clean establishment!!! The photos that they want you to purchase are overpriced!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/942lakenyas
50,Not just for the tourists!,"We were a bit hesitant at first about taking our tween girl and tween boys to this, as we weren't sure how they would react. It was definitely a success! They really enjoyed taking pictures with some of the wax figures, and we liked that it is kept timely and doesn't just figure classical figures. Also an ideal place to go to on a rainy day. We parked at the Hollywood & Highland center, and also had lunch there. Recommend PokeNometry. Not too expensive, and the food is delicious!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/claudiacU7223DW
40,Fun to try and pose with the wax figures,"Fun and life-like figures. Some of the wax figures had finger scratches on them, but they weren't very noticeable. We recommend watching the movie. Do NOT skip it. Be aware, it is 4D and you will get a little bit wet. The movie is quite amazing, and is awesome for everyone, but is more for boys because it is about superheroes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ryanctrips
50,Better than the wax museum,Excellent option for teenagers...avoid buying the cards for 4 trips...out of the many activities around probably this onw is the most decent one. If you are renting a car avoid the tour buses...if you have time constraints buy the red bus ticket for one day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rafamar
50,Get a discount coupon and save,"Really enjoyed this place. We had a half price coupon so cost much more reasonable but there were hawkers on the street nearby giving away discount coupons ,so some price breaks are easily available. Most of the wax figures were very good and it was fun seeing how tall the celebrities really are since the figures are life size. Go and play the tourist, you'll enjoy your visit here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spiegs882016
40,Interesting,"My husband, 2 teens, and I visited here and it was interesting that every figure is made of wax nice quick place to stop in and see in person good for pics as well. Total trip here was probably. Location was great as its right off walk of fame.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vindes
40,"Small, but good","Small museum. Budget a little over an hour for it. Might seem expensive tickets for the collection (we purchased online and got a slight discount). Located in Hollywood, I'd have expected a wider variety of actors. But can't complain of quality of the statues. Definitely worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lighttraveller3
30,Not as big as expected good for a bit of short and light entertainment,"Visited Madame Tussauds museums in other cities in the past. The Los Angeles museum was a bit disappointing as it seemed rather small compared to these other museums. Of course it is full of stars in the entertainment industry. Personally I would have preferred a big more of a mixture, but since it is located smack bang in the middle of the walk of fame in Hollywood that would probably unrealistic!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AussieClogwog
30,Nice indoor attraction but not worth the money,If they have a groupon on this attraction I suggest you buy it versus paying the full price! It's nice and fun to get close to your favorite celebrities wax statues but that's it. We were able to take pictures of everything but it lasted all of 1 hour and we were done.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A4591FZjessicar
50,Loved it!,"We have been to the one in New York several times and although not as good as the one in NYC, this was was awesome!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kalixts
50,up close and personal,You get to see all your famous people in one place and take pictures of them and with them. Too bad you cant pose them lol. Oh and wax hand making is painful and fun. (only the first 30sec),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sena2012
30,A visit to Madame Tussauds Hollywood,"We visited the Madam Tussauds Hollywood in end May 2016 as part of the attractions covered within our 3 day Los Angeles GO Pass though another wax museum, Hollywood Wax Museum seemed more popular among the two. Having visited better Madam Tussauds collection such as in London, this one has a comparatively small display area and lesser number of wax figures with the main emphasis on Hollywood celebrities. An added attraction is a 20 minute 4D film on comic book series ""Super Heroes"". Would only worth a visit if the attraction is included with a city pass like LA GO Pass.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ArindamG517
50,Exactly what you would expect,"Had a wonderful hour and some in this museum. If you've seen one, you won't get excited over this iteration, however, it's still a nice way to pass the time in Hollywood.We got here early, so there were no lines. Can't say about busier times.Plan anywhere between 1-2 hours for this location.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danihalf
30,Had pictures taken with Marilyn Monroe and Shrek,Didn't actually go in - just outside and was glad we saw it. Wish I did have the time to go in. Husband had pic taken with Marilyn Monroe and me with Shrek. My grandkids loved it went I sent it to them. Lots of discount coupons that we could have used but didn't have the time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/9gkids
10,This is not worth the expense and it is not fun,"If you love wax figures of movie stars and others. Well, enjoy, this is the place for you. That is what it is, a museum of wax figures placed in a setting. For example, you may see Marilyn Monroe dressed from a famous scene in a movie.You are in Hollywood. There is so much more to do. This should be no where near the top of your list.Parking is a bear. It is expensive. During the summer months it can get crowded and the areas you walk though to see the figures (which are not well done) can be daunting.Finally, the service is lacking. The line is sometimes long to get in and there is little assistance when you are inside.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elizabethlascheid
50,Love this place!,We had the best time here! I was surprised it was this great. Take lots of pictures of the fun memories you can make here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Laladavtoo
50,Loved all the celebrities,Great to see almost real like celebrities. Never knew all James bonds were not so big like we see them in picturesMust see if you visit LA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vigy1
30,Always FUN for first timers!!,"In my opinion New York MT is better, seems like they have more there and the Marvel Experience is inculded with General Admission, but that's just my opinion.This place is a great visit for anyone's first time or a returning guest like me who is obsessed with celebrities!!Check for brochures at hotels, Denny's or gas stations for discounts!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AleshaAmber
40,Really Good Fun,We went here in the evening when it was a little quieter and had a really good time. There are lots of displays that encourage you to get involved in the scene. We had a lot of time for photos and on a red hot day it is always nice and cool.I think this is one of the nicer attractions on Hollywood Boulevard.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Trigger85
40,Lot's Of Fun,"Id you have never been to a wax museum before, this is well worth your time. But, if you have seen one, this is very similar to others.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/keithp867
50,A Little Waxed Up,During our stay in Hollywood at the Loews we visited nearby Madame Tussaud's. I've been to a few wax museums so I like them. Look for the big green Shriek standing outside to take a picture with. Lot of street performers also on the adjacent Walk of Fame.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H8443OUjamesc
50,Fun,pretty cool visit. Most wax dont look like the person but some are spot on. Glad i did check it out.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JasonJ657
50,Loved every,"I paid only $29 for both me and my wife as we had a ""buy one and get one free"" voucher which we had picked up from a local travel brochure. The wax figures looked real with the majority being look-alikes of our favourite celebrities. The staff were courteous and very helpful. This place is definitely worth seeing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rowan548
30,Pretty Cool,"We took a tour with ""Gray Line Tours"" to go to Hollywood for the afternoon, one of the activities was this wax museum. First of all, that toilet you can use before you start the tour? It needs to be cleaned, and have a stash of toilet paper. Wasn't a very ""glamorous"" start to Hollywood. The wax models themselves are very life like. The ones that stick out in my mind were the Pitts, Betty White and Robin Williams. We left the first room, but it was a little confusing as to where the next part was. We went down some stairs so I hope we didn't miss anything we should have seen. The rest of the tour went reasonably quick, when we got the gift shop I was like, oh, it must be finished? We bought 2 of our photo's because I like dinosaurs and the deal was two for a certain price. I would recommend this museum to others but it's definitely the only thing I would recommend in Hollywood...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Robyn_256
50,What a blast!,Visited Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum while in LA for our daughter's graduation from USC. What a cool place! The figures are SO lifelike. Took plenty of pictures. Kids will love it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R3093SJrichardd
20,Not worth the money!,"We visited here as part of our day out in Hollywood. They price was $29 each. However we were fortune enough to get a $5 off voucher each from a guy dishing them out on the Main Street. However, it took us only about 20-30 minutes to get round to see it all. Prices are ridiculous for what it is. Don't recommend at all. London is much better and much more figures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bakergirl2692
50,Very interesting!,This wax museum is so well done that you feel like you are up close and personal with all the movie stars! It is very clean and the staff there are very friendly and will answer any questions! If you get the chance you should check it out!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Arlinda78
40,Very much REAL,"Loved this place. I really thought would have more...but what they had..very nice. Use a coupon ,....needs a discount. Great location...stop by",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cajusa76
40,Fun,"I've never been into one of these places, so it's pretty fun.They have Tony Stark and Iron Man! Love it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/f_soemawidjaja
50,Better than London,"Been to the Madame Tussauds in London and the Hollywood version compares favourably. There are lots of very detailed wax work celebrities and, unlike London, lots of space to enjoy and interact with the exhibits.Not too expensive either.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/russelljb
40,Pretty cool place - very lifelike,Worth visiting if you have a coupon or deal... probably wouldn't pay full price. The wax statues were very lifelike and fun for photos:),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/22reneek
50,Kinda cool,"I must admit that when my friends suggested we go here on our recent trip to L.A., I was super sceptical. But I instantly loved it. There is something fun and intriguing about seeing these celebrity figures. It was lots of fun taking pics and interacting with these look-alikes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IreneA246
50,Much more fun than I expected,This was so much more fun than I expected. The characters are amazingly lifelike. Being able to take pics with your favorite celebrity is a blast.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K_T_8889
40,Good to visit while in Hollywood,Good to visit while in Hollywood. I found a 50% off voucher in a magazine in the hotel we were staying at and that made it $14.95. The museum has 3 floors and the models are very life like. Good you can get pictures with all the people too if you want.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rhondae680
50,Best Wax Museum!,"We've been to a wax museum in Florida, but this one beats it by 100! The wax sculptures look real and identical to the actual celebrities. I can't wait to go to the other wax museums from Madame Tussaud's!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/961nataliea
40,A very good laugh,"Madame Toussauds is in the centre of the buzzing Hollywood Boulevard. It's not too expensive, but look out for offers in tourist maps and leaflets in your hotel. We got free tickets as part of an offer through one of the bus tour companies!This isn't as big as the one in London, but you can still easily spend a decent amount of time here, especially if you intend to pose with a lot of the waxworks... like I did. There's props to mess around with and staff to take professional pictures with featured waxworks.The Marvel 4D screening at the end is an interesting touch for families. It's optional, but you may as well!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GemmaNewbery
50,Best Wax Museum EVER!!!,"I've visited 3 other Madame Tussauds and had a great time visiting all 4 floors of this one!!! We found a coupon that gave us about $8 off the price of admission for each of the 4 of us. I think it was still around $20 per person. The wax likenesses of the sports, movie and television celebrities are lots of fun to interact and take pictures with. There are props with some of them. I wore a hoodie and rode on a bicycle with ET in front of a huge moon!!! It was lots of fun. My grown son and daughter-in-law and my husband all had a great time!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarikaAlthoff
30,Just alright not a must visit attraction,"I guess i expected a lot from Madame Tussauds but for $25, i guess it was alright but not a MUST VISIT. I spent only an hour the most and basically the majority figures are not of the celebs hyped about in the current generation.. Im 22 and I honesly was looking forward to President Obama & Justin Bieber (dont judge), unfortunately I didnt find them here and i was surprised! But ofcourse the classic characters which are rememered in hollywood cinema history are definitely present. Then there was the Avengers 4D show and prepared to get splashed multiple times on your face so a tip would be to bring facial tissues.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maiaradh2293
40,Must See If In Hollywood,"Went here on my recent visit to LA. There are 3 floors of wax figures to see...stars, athletes, famous dignitaries. They also supply many props for your photo ops. It takes at least 30 minutes to see all 3 floors. At the end, don't exit right away. There is a 4D short Marvel superheroes film you can see which is about 10 minutes. Many people were exiting, not realizing there was a film you could see. It's easy to miss if you are not expecting it. Make sure u bring your camera. Also go on the internet before going to get a discount. I got $10 off and was able to get an eticket on my phone but u can print out the discount if u want.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ronnie333_3
40,A great experience!,"It was much bigger than we thought from outside, well laid out with some great displays and wax statues. We spent a couple of hours exploring and took some great photos with the exhibits. We found staff to be friendly and helpful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Leebell82
40,Goofing around,"If you want a place to act silly and take comical pictures of yourself with some celebrities, this is the place to go. Some of the work looks so real its spooky. But, I'm sure it won't stop you from standing up close to your favorite celeb and taking a photo or 2 or 3 who knows. Once you get into making funny photos with them it's hard to stop. And there is no time limit on how long you can stay. Except of course at closing time they probably will boot you out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/627deem
40,If you love celebrity selfies..this is your kind of place!!,My teenager loved Madame Tussauds. Selfie paradise!! I enjoyed it as well. Its clean and has a great variety of wax figures to admire. Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid was the creme of the crop!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/604LisaB
30,A bit lack luster. But not bad,We have been to a few different Madame Tussaud's in the past and this isn't one if the best.Some of the works are a bit old and some had been removed from there places as I think there was some work being done to create the new marvel section which was OK.There are some good waxworks there as well that look very good and you get to interact with some props when posing for pictures.Overall an average visit and probably worth a look if you got $30 dollars spare for a ticket which is a bit overpriced.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/glenc360
50,click amazing pictures,You can click amazing pictures at this place.. Oh man wonder how were the statues made!! You can even get your hand wax statue.. Its so cool but fragile.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrsnMrKhan
40,"Smaller than usual, but a fun visit",I think it's a bit expensive for the collection inside. It's a way smaller Madame Tussauds than London. However it was fun to see portrayals of Hollywood stars from way back to today. We visited the museum later in the evening so we were able to see everything clearly and take great pictures. I would recommend people to go later so it's not crowded (its open till 10PM),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/evlinu
40,buy one get one free coupon at Visitor center,"i paid half price for this ~!!! found the coupon at visitor center used it and had great time~!! 1-2 hours relaxing tour, not as big compare to the other location tho, still a great place to visit",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/steveny291
30,"It's always interesting, but it should be better","Ive been too many MTs around the world and I thought this should be the best, but unfortunately it wasn't.Also, some statues song look real at all.Overall, it's a must go and photos should be taken specially the ones offered from the museum's crew.Enjoy ;)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashrafk2013
50,Lots of fun,I was a little skeptical but I had a great time. Lots of different personalities with tons of opportunities to take pictures with. Sometimes you even can use props that are offered.Also lots of fun facts to every person and about Madame thousands.In short lots of fun,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Benny898
50,Very realistic !,I've been to the Musee Grevin in Paris and I can tell you that madame tussaud is way better ! The wax celebrities seem so real ! And you have plenty of objects to make a very cool photo with them ! I recommend ! ☺,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/s_bastienb159
50,Great fun,This was great fun - it costs $30 each but we got $10 off each as we had a hop on hop off bus pass. Lots and lots of celebrities on three floors - some of them were better than others but overall it was awesome. You could interact with them and sometimes there were props available. Do it - you won't be disappointed!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/895julieannl

50,Not without your camera!,"To me this museum is a must if you really want to ""feel"" Hollywood!There are wax statues of current celebrities and of celebrities of the past Hollywood Golden era which are extremely cool! They have a lot of statues in movie settings (the Enterprise bridge, Forrest Gump bench, etc.) which is also pretty great.You can take all the pictures you want and it is really a lot of fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AliciaMagdalena
40,Interesting experience,"It's interesting to ""meet"" so many superstars at one time. The statues look so real. The experience was very interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ekyloh20140804
30,"Average, expensive for what you get!","I'm not sure what I was expecting but that wasn't it! It was fun for 5 minutes taking stupid photos with the wax statues then it was boring! Not worth the entry price, that's for sure! Kids would probably enjoy it",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/590staceyw
40,Take your Camera,"Lucky enough to have been here twice when I got free tickets from starlines tours for booking a tour.There are lots of celebrities some historic and some more recent.There's a great area with some movies settings. Danny from Grease with Grease Lighting, Forrest Gump on the Chair with his box of chocolates, inside the star ship enterprise.Upstairs you'll fine celebrities like Lady Gaga, Taylor etc.There's an area for the golden era of movies breakfast at tiffany's, Gone with the Wind, etcTake your camera and take plenty of photos. Lots of fun to be had.Easy location in the heart of the Hollywood strip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ero40
40,Beautiful,"This is a must to go spot if you like to feel the glamour of Hollywood, and to enjoy the interesting experience of seeing many of your favorite Hollywood stars, made of wax😂😂 This makes it a perfect occasion to show your inner photographer skills, and to take as many ""stupid"" pictures as you want!.... ehm, sorry I mean...as many ""creative"" shots/poses as you want lol",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SF_BeachLovers
40,Very good work,I can compare this one to the one in Berlin and have to say that the wax figures are much better and a lot more starts and famous people to see. The 4D experience was also worth seeing. We enjoyed that very much.I recommend this place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EnnoFL89
10,Rubbish!!,The wax works aren't that great.The staff were too pushy on selling the photos through the experience and the front desk people were just obnoxious.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Betsy023
50,A day with celebrities!,"I spent hours in this place! Took pictures with almost every one of my favorite celebrities, and enjoyed every moment with my friends! A must see in Hollywood, don't miss it out!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SarahFakhr
50,Fun place to take photos,At Madame Tussauds you have full access to all the wax figures which makes it fun to take photos and pose with the celebrity look a likes. The other wax museum in Hollywood has fewer pieces and does not give you the same access.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cougski
50,Very cool!,The best Madame Tussauds museum I've visited (I've been to many)! Very cool and interactive decors that make you feel part of the movie!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bogdansstavrev
40,Gotta see this place,"My first wax museum......an odd combination of delight and creepiness. The figures are so lifelike, you have to remind yourself that they are just statues. The place is set up for photo ops of you and these lifelike figures. My only complaint is that the admission price is a bit high for a smallish venue.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LuvtoTravel99
50,We loved it!,"Its a must go in Hollywood! I've been to other Madame Tussaud's this one felt special, maybe just cause of the location. We took the smart destination Go card, most museums were covered! Pretty cool! The least cool thing was Six flags.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Drfla1
40,surprised us how life like it was,"get a 3 day LA GO card and visit this exhibit, we assure you it will be worth the trip. the figures are very life like and have a page of facts with them that tells a little story of their life.it will take about two hours to see everything including a little movie at the end. the pictures are fairly reasonable and there is about four places they take them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tctommy
50,Fun experience!,The wax personalities in the Madame Tussauds museum is of outstanding quality. The stars are well presented and there is many photo opportunities. Well worth a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rudio199
50,"What a great way to ""meet"" the stars!!!","I visited Madame Tussauds Hollywood on my first day in the United States, and I had an awesome time!!!!there was a great variety of ""stars"" to take selfies with - old stars and new!!! I loved the ""museum"" part of how the models are made, and purchasing my hand in wax was a pretty unique souvenir to take home!!!!The staff were very helpful and courteous!!!What a great afternoon!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/543natalier
50,"Fun, Fun, FUN!","Madame Tussauds in Hollywood was OUTSTANDING! Great fun! A little pricey, but well worth the price. We found coupons at our hotel giving us $2.00 off per ticket. Plan to spend a few hours in this place. We went at a very busy time (around 3 pm) and it wasn't that crowded considering how congested it was just right outside the door! The staff members were nice and you are pretty much on your own through the whole museum, which we liked. Be prepared to take LOTS of pics!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mountain_Momma3
50,Probably our favorite thing we did,"We have two teenage hams and they LOVED Madame Tussauds. We got there late morning and it wasn't very crowded. We took a ton of pictures. They have props and the wax figures are posed in a way that makes them easy to interact with. I think our best photo is the one of my son and his favorite, Robin Williams. It makes me sad. If you love movies you'll enjoy it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deltaduck2
40,Enjoyable couple of hours for the family,"Just off a very congested walk of fame, it was nice to walk around MT which wasn't overly busy.The usual mix of contemporary and historical celebrities, film stars, sports people which the kids (6-14) found entertaining.The Marvel 4D experience wasn't as good as the London version, but all in all this attraction was reasonable value (pre-booked via website) in a town known for extracting $$$s out of visitors.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pbh73
40,The best wax museum in hollywood,We went on a Hollywood Homes tour and this was an add on. Hadn't really planned to go but was pleasantly surprised. Great was figures of famous people in the entertainment industry. Visited the other wax museum a few years ago and thought this one was better. The eyes of the wax figures are sometimes creepy and seem to follow you. We enjoyed our visit and would recommend it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kbarden
50,Very enjoyable,could improve with a ride through the museum similar to the one in London. Great theme of Hollywood throughout the displays - friendly welcoming staff,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tpotgieter
40,Lots of fun,"We had such a good time here and there was plenty to see but I think there could have been more on offer. The models were all spread out making it seem a little empty in spaces, and some of them seemed a little outdated but we still thought it was great. The attention to detail was amazing and everything was kept in great condition. The place looked great and was clean and tidy. It wasn't overly busy which meant we weren't fighting to get photo time and we didn't feel like we were rushed through it. The staff were nice and helpful and the prices seemed reasonable. We'd definitely go recommend it",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HuBo16
40,Some of the figures are very realistic,"Nice museum, which has many figures of famous people with whom you can take a photo. Some figures are very similar to original people and some not so. However, it will be interesting to visit this museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/richardbT2103JE
50,Great!,Wow these models are so life like you actually thing the star is there looking at you! Our 15 yo daughter absolutely loved it 5 stars,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andrewa963
30,Expected more attractions,"Visited this attraction as part of the GO LA pass. My kids are die hard Avenges fans, they loved the avengers figures and the 4D movie which was the highlight of the visit. Having visited other madam Tussaud's locations expected mores figures as it was the ""Hollywood"" exhibition.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thilinag2013
50,Worth Fighting The Crowds,"I recommend buying your tickets online, you can pick them up at the Will Call, this will save you a bit of money. Most of the mannequins on display at amazing! You are allowed to touch them (just not the head or hair) and they provide props near some of them so you can stage pictures. There were a couple prominent figures missing the day we visited, but it was still an incredible visit, with LOTS of pictures taken. Make sure to have plenty of storage on your camera.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/prowler7
50,Get up close to the movie stars without getting arrested.,What a better way to get photos with your favourite celebs. We decided whilst walking around Hollywood Blvd to go here. It was reasonably priced and a lot of fun. The wax sculptures were extremely life like and made for some great photos for the album. Take your time have a good look around and get a lot of photos. A selfie stick comes in handy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/benbencor
40,easy to walk around and see everything,"Small museum (3 levels) and is very easy to walk around and get photos with all of the celebrities, didn't have to wait for photos. Lots of different celebrities from many eras",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carolinedK4224QY
50,You must visit this place when you are in Hollywood!,"If you are fan of movie super stars, or singers, this is going to be the (only) way, you could take a selfie with them. It's allowed to touch them, hug or kiss celebrities, so, do it when you visit this place!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luiscanelo
40,The ONE Madame Tussauds which should not be missed,"Out of all the wax museums , this is one at LA should not be missed. We were in fickle minds before visiting it as we had already visited one at SFO , but I am glad that we didn't miss this one out. It gives you the feeling of actually being among the all the celebrities (although you are only among and their charismatic statues! )Also, we saved on the ticket fee as we purchased tickets for universal studios from Madame Tussauds ticket counter. Not sure if there was some special offer going that time but you can surely try your luck :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/507aditid
50,Fun Time,"I was not sure about this activity, but we went ahead and did it. I'm glad we did. We got some fun pictures with the wax figures of stars. Also, there is a 4-d movie at the end that the kids loved.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T3580VCkellyl
50,The best wax museum,Try going in and you'll see all your favourite Hollywood stars. You have to pay to get in so prepare some cash for it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChicTravelAddict
40,Fun way to get Star Struck in Hollywood,"We had a great time posing for pictures with many of our favorite stars. Many of them are dressed an posed in movie scene positions and set up so you can get right in the ""action"" and the museum even has props that you can wear to fit right in (like hats, canes, feather boas, etc.). I loved sitting at the desk with Vito Corleone making him an offer that he couldn't refuse, and we loved posing with stars in life-like action shots.We also enjoyed looking a the behind the scenes area where they explain how they create the statues. I was sorry that a couple of my favorite stars were out for repairs, but there were enough there to keep us busy for a couple of hours. My teenage daughter loved it, and so did I.It is not necessary to pay full price, as there are several people giving out coupons on the street, and we found an even better coupon in our airline magazine for 50% off. The coupons seem to be everywhere. Also, the parking garage under Madam Tussad's was good for the money and let us keep the car there all day while we explored the walk of fame. I recommend arriving early (by 10 am) if you are going to park there since parking fills up fast. Have a great time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Laurelms
40,Good for a few hours,"Had a great time in here, had a few cheeky selfies. and the figures were lifelike. It broke up the day and let you relax as you were having fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/414jackiec
40,Fun if you can get a Groupon or discount card,"Very cool and interesting. It's expensive though, so would only recommend if you can get admission cheaper either through Groupon, or other discount voucher.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BazisGirl
30,Realistic,"This museum is something you need to do once in your life, not in every city there is one. The statues are very realistic and are updated periodically. The museum is very well presented and fun with many props and photo opportunities.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/347SandraM
50,Very Fun,Madame Tussaud is a very fun activity to do while you visit Hollywood with your family . Each statue looks very real.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PierreTheFoodie
50,so much fun!,"This place isn't cheap, but you will have so much fun with your friends here that it is totally worth it. This place is a must see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChrisD1976
40,lots of fun!,We enjoyed this experience. So much to look at and so many photo ops. the price was a bit high for a quick walk through experience but it was worth it. Find coupons. They are everywhere.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/authorhillaryd
40,"Fun time for photos with ""stars""","Had some free time in LA so decided to stop in. Don't pay full price as discounts are everywhere. If you don't have a coupon already someone will hand you one as you walk down the street. We got $5 off coupons that way. Also if you use the public parking garage get validated at the visitor center office. The wax figures vary somewhat in how realistic they look. Some are very accurate others are just good. My teenage daughter and I had lots of fun posing with the various figures. You are allowed to touch them so you can have your arms around Brad and Angelina or hug Marilyn Monroe. There is a good sampling from the Golden Age of Hollywood and modern music and film stars. Definitely bring a camera or a good smartphone. A little dark in some areas so a flash is needed. A couple areas the museum will do photos and offer to sell them to you at the end of the tour. Tour is self-guided so you can take as much time as you want. We spent a couple hours. There is also a ""4D"" Avengers animated short. 3 D glasses plus some physical effects while you watch the video. It was entertaining.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WingsOTW
50,WAX Perfection,Lots of fun! A bit pricey. Some of the wax figures are much more believable than others. Loved seeing all the old Hollywood stars! All in all it made for some great pictures and lots of fun! The short film is sensory overload.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mytrips50
50,spring break,I brought with me an exchange student from Norway. we were both on spring break. We both found this to be very interactive. you could try on things to become a part of what was presented. We took our time and really enjoyed it. Its amazing how real the wax figures really look...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/448JulieP448
40,If you don't mind the price it's a short fun,"It's definitely very touristy, but things were very well done. Maybe because it was the price, or just still early in the day, it was nice and quiet inside. But I felt that so many famous eyes were watching me as I walked around!!! It was a good trill. A little overpriced, but fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Teslamate
40,A lot of fun,I didn't have high hopes for the Hollywood branch of Madame Tussaud's but was pleasantly surprised.They have three story's of waxworks and have a lot of the bigger stars you'd want to see.With it being Hollywood there is a big emphasis on movie stars from early years to modern day.Killed a couple of hours and was good fun.They let you take photos and touch the waxworks(although not the face or hair)Nice 10 minute 4d show at the end.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brianbY752PL
30,Fairly ok,In comparison to the other places I went to in Hollywood this one was not all that but fairly ok. If I had to buy a seperate ticket for it I wouldn't really bother. But all the same it was fun to see the celebrities in wax. Rocky was my favourite! And President Obama!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karenthebem
50,Lots of fun,I wasn't sure if to get inside the Madame Tussaud's but definitely was worth it. A lot of fun! This is a three story building with many of the most prominets celebrities. Very realistic and nicely decorated.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ronnystam
50,All celebrity in one place,You can visit once to see all the wax statue.. also there are many coupons online so u get discounted price or check out for ppl handing over coupons on walk of fame you can save $10 - $15 on these coupons,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VishwakV
40,Great Place - Price too high for tour,Our first time here. Great tourist place but $30 is too expensive. The quality was very good and teens had fun visiting but for a family this was way too expensive. Would not pay that price again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/690deniser
40,Good fun to be had for a few hours in Hollywood.,"This wax museum is amazing. the real life like celebrities that have been formed in this attraction are amazing. There is no doubt that some of the older celebrities do not look as real as the more modern ones but they views are amazing none the less. Probably a little over priced for what it is. However it is intellectual, and if you want you can get involved with the statues as they have set up themes to allow people to interact with their favourite celebrities.They will take pictures of you throughout the experience and tell you to collect them at the end once you leave the venue... what they don't tell you is that if you want those pictures you may need to amputate your arm and pay for it with the said arm. so really unless you've got plenty of money to spend, it really isn't worth taking the setup pictures throughout, cause you're only allowed to view them for about 5 seconds each if you choose not to purchase them.None the less i went here with a mate and we had a great time, if you're on the hollywood BLVD it is a definite attraction worth seeing.I was at this attraction around 3 years ago with my fiancé and re attended this time around. There are some of the same statues about but many of them were new, and this time around it was more intellectual.Happy travels.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Simage82
30,Good but expensive,Really research deals before you go. It is expensive if you are just there and decide to go. The detail on the figures is incredible. Interesting to see them actual size since you can never tell by seeing people on tv or in movies. Biggest complaint was expense.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dchorton
50,Very cool!,It was better than what I expected! Lots of cool celebrities. It was fun to compare height and just get an idea of how they may look in person. I found it really fun and interesting. It really wasn't too busy when we went. It was a Monday morning around 10am. They try and sell you photos that are way too pricey so just take your own photos!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/700kimberleyr
50,So much fun!,"I would definitely recommend going to Madame Tussauds if you have the time and the money. My husband had some time to kill and had been to the one in Vegas so I suggested we go here. He reluctantly agreed but honestly it was one of the most fun things we did on our trip!I think we only saw a couple of the same people we saw in Vegas (Will Smith & Justin Timberlake) so it was good value because we got to see different wax works.There are lots of areas where you can have your photos taken by people who work there but if you individually have your photos taken then they tell you the other person can still take pictures which I thought was pretty cool. The guy at the E.T. section made sure I'd taken my photos each time he told my husband to do another pose which was nice of him.There are lots of props around the place. With Grease they had T-Bird and Pink Lady jackets, you could climb into the 'Psycho' shower and my personal favourite was dressing up like Rocky! It being Hollywood there was a big movie theme going on with a lot of the waxworks.At the end there is the Marvel 4D show. We didn't bother as we had seen it in Vegas. It's OK, quite kiddy. Only do it if you have children or are that big of a Marvel fan.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/victoriaf683
40,Interesting,Museum was very nice. But thought they would of had more figures. Price was ok. But have seen better wax museums. What they had was interesting and could take pictures of all the figures at any angle,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/723sigridw
40,Better then Las Vegas,Much better then las Vegas more exhibits for the same price only minor problem it does get very crowded.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/plavoo
40,Fun thing to do,We had such a good time visiting here and taking lots of photos.Its worth the money we paid to get in and its a great fun. You get to go round at your own speed which is great and there was a 4D Marvels movie at the end which was awesome!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/allypop890
40,A place to visit,Wonderful representation of famous people that leads us to awesome times and decades. It's also awesome that you can interact and take part of the scene where you have the famous. Really good!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jo_opaulof651
50,Very interactive,"Much better than our local one in London. Staff on hand to take pictures so you can possibly buy them at the end, props to use for your photos too. No obligation to buy photos and you can take your own pictures too",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/russellm691
50,Surprisingly fun,"I assumed this place was going to be a bunch of wax movie stars. But they encourage interaction with stars on chairs next to stars and props I the rooms. We were just told, ""please just don't touch the face, hair, and neck."" The 4d marvel super heroes movie at the end was great!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leeyparsons
50,Must See in Hollywood! Fun Exhibits and Professional Friendly Staff,"Every time I visit, I have a great time! Located literally right next to Graumann's Chinese Theater and across from the historic and famous Hotel Roosevelt, Madame Tussauds Hollywood. Three floors of theme rooms filled with life-like statutes. Great place to take photos with all the ""stars"".",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelTVproducer
40,Really good fun!,"When you get to Hollywood there isn't that much to do, but I would really recommend this. It is good fun and we loved taking silly photos with all the stars. You get some great shots - in particular we love the ones we got on the bike with ET!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/806RebeccaS
50,Really cool!,"This was the first Madame Tusauds me and my parents went to after hearing so much about it and were amazed by all the life-like statues, especially the camera guy at the start.They have loads of celebrities from movie stars to superheroes and even video game characters which was awesome.This is probably the closest we will get to the big celebrities.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/phillips714
40,Grab a discount voucher from a tout,"We grabbed a discount voucher from a guy handing them out on the Walk Of Fame. This can save you $10 off and adult ticket, so we only paid $19.95 each to get in. Better than $29.95! The attraction itself was good, some really lifelike and a little spooky when you get up close. Some great photo opportunities and a fun afternoon :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Katrinder
40,Cool!,"The wax figures are really well done! I particularly enjoyed the interactive figures, especially grease!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wilch303
30,Creepy,The figures are really well done but are really quite creepy they kind of appear to be staring straight through you!! Plus im pretty sure stephen speilberg nodded at me!!It is a good experience for an hour or so but does get monotonous and repetitive. Worth a visit,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/966zacb
50,Awesome!,"We had never visited a Madame Tussauds, but made a beeline for this one evening. It was fantastic! We absolutely loved it. Adored the ET bike, the Grease car and Dirty Dancing photo ops! We bought a combined ticket on the door with Universal Studios, which saved us money. Excellent deal and a lot of fun. Highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlannaP938
50,Worth it !!!!!!,Definitely worth the price of admission. Wife and I had a great time and most of the statues were so life like. Would go again next trip out there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anthonyrU1046VH
50,So real it's creepy!,You can take your time walking through and can actually touch the statues (not the faces). Some of them look like they might just get up and leave. The only one that looked fake was Taylor Swift which was too bad as it was one we were looking forward to seeing. Cute 4D Marvel movie was included.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HappyCampersNH
50,Fun times if you make it fun.,"If you plan to walk thru and just look, you probably won't have much fun. If you take the time to read each sign, try on the costumes and place yourself in the time and place with that wax figure, you can have a blast. We used the city pass which included this and made it a good value! Pictures in this case are better than words.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GwenParmer
50,Fun,The wax museum was very engaging. We took many pictures. My daughter made a wax hand mold. We saw a 4D movie too. My 77yr old father enjoyed himself the most running around like a child.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mushyb
30,Good,We only went inside because it was scorching hot outside LA. There are more celebrities on this location. There wasn't many tourists (which is good) as they are enjoying the weather. Staff were friendly.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/richelldeguzman
50,Cheesy but fun thing to do when in Hollywood.,"I really didn't think I would enjoy this place very much, but I have to say it was a blast. My friend and I really had fun taking pictures with all the figures. Some of the wax figures look so lifelike that it is creepy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/808vickik
30,Not shabby,"This is the second Madame Tussaud's I've been to. The first was in Amsterdam. Both are very similar. Open spaces filled with wax figures who are creepily life-like.It's fun to roam around, take pictures with your favorite celebrities and compare their sizes and looks with your own. The best one here is by far Lady Gaga who looks the most realistic.It's a good way to spend the afternoon when you need a break from the busy hustle of the Walk of Fame. I recommend it if you are not shy about the price. It is a tad expensive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/200ashleys
40,"Fun, specially if you know about celebrities","This place is fun and we were surprised by the large amount of wax figures that they have. More than you can imagine. They have a lot of what you would expect, A type celebrities but they also have character from popular movies like spiderman, Captain America and the like. They also have sports and music celebrities.You have to visit at least once.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lxjuarez
40,Fun place,"Went as part of GOLA pass. not sure i'd pay for it separately. It was a rainy day(???in LA!!!) when we went, so were happy to be indoors. Fun to see the amazing wax figures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michelleb558
40,Decent price,"I paid about $20 on the door with no queue to go to Madame Tussauds which was a pleasant surprise considering how packed and pricey the London version is. I was able to wander around at my leisure and take photos of and with the various wax figures. When it came to the Obama statue, there was a chance to get a proper photo which I took, but then when I got to the end of the tour it turned out to be $30 to access the photos I'd had taken of me which was a giant rip-off, but I decided to do it anyway because I quite liked two of the pictures. I'd recommend it if you have a couple of hours to kill and a decent knowledge of celebrities old and new!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/172lydiac
50,Impressive!,"Definitely a very fun stop along the way of our LA tour! Great photos, lots of laughs and a beautiful tribute to the many great entertainers! Highly recommend for all the ages!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/resourceforquality
30,Good If You've Never Been To One,"The Madam Tussaud museum has always piqued my interest but just not enough for me to actually visit one. So, I was excited to say the least, when I got conformation.The Fiance and I got here a little after 7pm via the metro station and the check-in line was short. We were checked-in and having our photos taken within a matter of mins.On to the event itself. After the red carpet photo op, we made our way to the wine bar to get the night started and proceeded up to the 3rd floor where we were greeted by the lovely Katie B. A quick spiel and we were off on our self guided tour. Each floor was segmented into various themes and iconic scenes from the movies. Many of the wax figures bare an uncanny resemblance to their celebrity counterpart. Even though we all knew that the wax figurines were just that, figurines, it was still exciting to see a replica of a celebrity. I couldn't help but took a few selfies with few of them.In addition to the wax figurines on display- you can get your very own wax sculpture of your hand. It was quite interesting to see how quickly the wax form and harden. The short pain of ice water was definitely worth it.Along with the exhibits, we were greeted with food and alcohol on every floor. From chicken marsala to Pink's hotdogs, chicken bites and jelly shots to vodka induced ice cream. Everything was fantastic.And best of all, we all got 4 comp tickets as parting gifts. I'm definitely making my way back here and telling my friends about this place. It's definitely worth the admission price.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/crabwalk_koala
20,Not worth the price,"I was expecting to see many of the wax figures of the Hollywood stars, but no, there were just a few wax figures in the three-floor exhibition (each floor is tiny). There are a lot of stars showcased on the Walk of Fame just outside of the museum, making the contrast more pronounced.We finished the tour quickly, ending it with a 4D clip of the superheroes, which was quite a fun experience.Considering the price of the tickets, I would not recommend Madame Tussauds Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Emmabearx
30,Wax Sculptures,"There is another Madame Tussauds in London which would have a line out the door that took over an hour to get inside, maybe I just don't get the hype but there are about a hundred other things I would rather see than a bunch of wax celebrity replicas",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/runawayblond
50,I loved the wax figures at Madame Tussauds,When I went to Madame Tussauds I was amazed how the wax figures of famous people was the best part of the Madame Tussauds.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rachaelk924
30,Movie stars,"A Tussauds you have to visit if you are in for movie stars, but not the best - here the Madame Tussauds in London is better",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karsten1960
50,Madam Tussards Wax Museum,"What a great way to spend two or three hours. This place is definitely more fun if you take advantage of the props to take pictures. Many of the figures are so ""real"" like the guy taking a picture as soon as you get to the second floor! (We stopped so we wouldn't bomb his photo then realized he wasn't real!) loved it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sharonsB6700QD
40,Almost real,"We had to choose between Madame Tussauds Hollywood and Las Vegas. We choose for the one in Hollywood because in Las Vegas there were less people we knew. And we didn't regret it! It's not so cheap (We took a combi-ticket with Universal Studios, that was cheaper, they have several combi-ticket options, check this) but it was almost real! I remember Snoop Dogg was very very realistic. Certainly worth visiting if you are on Hollywood Boulevard!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JimmyBul
50,FAN-tabulous!,"Lots of fun. Enjoyed seeing the wax images, although some didn't hit the mark for me, but most were spot on.I liked that it wasn't a quick walk in and out. This place took some time and has multi-levels.Totally enjoyed the 4D theater experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/InnerVortex61
40,good to visit if you never been in one before,"we got a deal from travelzoo and I think similar offer in groupon when we were there. great place w/ air condition during a hot day. get to post photos with celebrities all you want. if you never been to one, you should visit it once. hand molding / waxing was fun too to take it home with you as part of trip memory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tomu023
50,its super cool!,"even though i am an LA native and work across the street from this place, it is really cool to see celebrities immortalized in wax.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dorkiemiche
40,Selfie stick is a must,"A few good celebrities, so strike a pose and get snap happy! A few of the displays had props you could use to make the photos even better.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Trixiebelle01
50,Great Museum!,"We attended the museum with our 3 kids (11,7 & 4) and we all loved it. The figures looked so realistic and the variety kept us all interested throughout. Check your hotel for a brochure for the museum which gives $8 off per person.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TESS1936
40,Good place,"it's actually quite big and located on a couple of floors, maybe 3, not as big as in London or Paris. in the very end, leaving the museum but entering a gift shop, right on your left, there is a 4D theater. I had a blast three! Surprisingly I was by myself. The reason I suspect was, that it was not marked at all. I thought I found myself outside - happened to be a great spot instead.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/k0za
50,Fun time!,"We thoroughly enjoyed taking photos with all the wax stars and loved the 4D movie. Great experience, worth it if you dont mind paying the pricey price tag!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/612ashleyh
30,Great attraction however overpriced,"As per my title, great attraction. We enjoyed walking through the exhibit however it is overpriced, especially when you have a family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GSTAA5
40,Great to click selfies,"We went here on Martin Luther King weekend, and it was an afternoon well spent, museum has different groups of celebrity section based on era, genre, they look close to real but not real.Tip:Don't expect too much and just enjoy clicking selfies!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anshuly
50,to try,"to try once is good, they have this museum in different cities around the world just try oneit is located in hollywood boulevard easy to access by metro",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SPAINDOCTOR
40,Great place to visit,"A great place visit, for the family as well as couples.Lots of interesting things to see, and the Avengers show makes it that much more awesome.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pajoubert
20,Nothing great,It was a drab affair. The manaquines are not replica and looks like out of date. May be if one has not seen madam toussads elsewhere than one can see. Otherwise better to avoid if you something worthwhile to do..,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ajaycisf
50,"Expensive, but well done. Haunted?",Very nice displays and spaced well enough to feel even more like they are real people in the next room when you turn a corner. There are some historical reasons why this property may be haunted. Keep your senses alert!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kauai-Biz-Traveler
50,Great way to spend a few hours.,As you'd expect the focus is on the entertainment industry in general and film in particular. From John Wayne and Humphrey Bogart through to current stars there's a good spread with props added to get kitted up for your posing with the stars of your choice. Located near to the Chinese Theatre (hand and footprints of the star) and Dolby Theatre (Oscars) on the Walk of Fame - it's got to be on the bucket list.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tonymc47
50,Look real and variety of big stars,"The wax looks so real, and so many of my favirate movie stars. I took photo holding hands with James Bond and told my friend that that's my new husband and my friends believed that,,,,, good fun.There are 3 levels and more starts than I thought with different movie settings, such as Jackie Chen, tiger wood, etc. very good",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alholdings2008
50,Up close and personal with the celebrities.,"We were amazed how life like the figures were. You get to walk yourself around from room to room and take pictures of yourself or friends posing with each, so act a little crazy and take some creative poses, not just stand there. there are also some costumes to wear for some figures and scenes. have fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnsstein
50,Loved it!,Had an amazing time! The wax figures look so incredibly real. You are able to walk right up to them and take pictures of them and with them. There are several places along the way that you can have your pictures taken. They are for sale at the end. $40 for five printed photos and all of your pictures available for download. The more pictures you have taken the better the deal. There is also an incredible interactive movie at the end that is a must! Don't forget to look for their flyer in your hotel lobby. It saved us $8 a person.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/savedbyhim2
40,"Definitely fun, definitely crowded","This place is an awesome part of Hollywood. Like everything else on or near the Walk of Fame, though, it gets packed QUICK. I'd tell people to be willing to wait a bit to get in, and not to get too worried about moving quickly once you're in there. It's well worth it if you're looking for fun photo opportunities, you just have to deal with everyone else also wanting to take fun photos while you're there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/samakablam
50,Surprisingly fun!,". It is in the middle of Hollywood and it is actually a nice place as a start point to your tour (address: 6933 Hollywood Blvd, Hollywood, CA 90028). I’ve never been to one of those before and always thought it would be one of that boring things tourists do, but I actually had a very nice time there and a lot of fun. The statues are freakin real, that I’m still afraid of Antony Hopkins as the scary Hannibal Lecter… And Julia Roberts? Wow, she’s is gorgeous and I think she liked me!!! At the end of the attraction there is 4D cinema which was also very nice. I almost missed it, but it was really worth it (for kids and adults…)!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Robertopelomundo
40,Wonderful,"Loved spending the afternoon there, it was great fun. The figures are amazing, I bumped into one and apologised, then realised it was a exhibit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Granniebea
50,Really fun,Take your picture with JLo or JLaw. Stand in the psycho tub behind Hitch. Lots of modern and old time stars. Very realistic. There are coupons around that make your visit affordable.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lchicagolaw
40,An hour of fun!,This was my first visit to Madame Tussauds and it was a fun; I was able to get lots of photos also it was interesting to find out the actual height of some of my favorite celebrites but after an hour it get a little boring.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NicoleT184
50,This was really excellent (DON'T go to the other wax museum!),"Went to the Hollywood wax museum first and it was so cheesy and awful my daughter had to really talk me into going to Madame Tussauds. Totally different experience - awesome wax figures, fun displays, and the story of Madame Tussaud and the process of creating the figures was really fun to learn about.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TRichards19
30,Nothing like London. Small & disappointing.,"I LOVE wax museums, espec. Madame Tussauds. However, the Hollywood MT is small & disappointing IF you're expecting it to be like the one in London. However, if you've never been to a MT's, then it's worth the tourist experience to check it out. Go online to get discounts, though!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/332marleneh
50,Tons of photo opportunities and realistic models,"Madame Tussauds Hollywood is definitely where I took the most photos in my whole trip to the US. The wax models were so real that I said sorry after i bumped into one of them. True story. Also, if you do get the photos at the gift shop, get the vip package where you can get 5 printed copies and more importantly ALL the pictures that were taken at the posts there by the staff. Definitely worth the price!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jiachaol
30,Underwhelming,"The museum is not in the nicest neighborhood with street pedlars and costumed hustlers nearby, it was a little bit hectic. If you park in their underground parking lot, be prepared to climb stairs because the elevators were blocked off or out of order when we went.Inside, the wax figures were presented in bad lighting which made it harder to get good pictures. Some of the figures were impressive, some were old and smaller than than expected but we had a good time in spite of. Hardly any staff was around and there was no order to any of it. People were rude, and bumping into to wax figures causing them to nearly tumble over. We also watched the 4D Avengers show. It was OK. I'm glad I went and that I didn't pay full price for the tickets. I don't feel like I would need to again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pishkap
50,Brilliant to fill a couple of hours,Went using the LA Go Card spent a couple of hours here great models and well priced at $30 people in the street had flyers also offering a $10 discount so look out for these! Great photos can be taken avoid buying the expensive official ones and take your own the staff will happily take one of a couple for you at no charge.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/COD_and_BEX
40,Same thing whever you go.,Not that exciting as I have been to the one in London and it is exactly the same. I would not pay for this attraction as I went because it came free with a tour I booked however is a good place to spend some free time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/valq1995
50,Heart of Hollywood,I haven't been to a Madame Tussaud for such a long time I was unsure whether to go but I wasn't disappointed. It as three floors of fun and some exhibits have accessories for you to put on and take pictures. We went while the avengers 4d cinema was on which was great. The price is expensive but down the Hollywood boulevard there was somebody giving out vouchers with $10 off. We booked a universal studios ticket and got it free as a combo. So if you looked around there was other deals aswell.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/monkey2009Cheshire
50,Had the best time,Had the best time at Madame Tussauds. The figures were so life-like and my kids and I all enjoyed it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HKoreenRS37
30,Not Impressive....,"We went there while we near the Chinese theatre and got cheap tickets.Comprised of 3 storeys the museum has not much to offer.Especially if you have visited London's Madame Tussaude...like me ,it will not impress you a lot.The Movie shown at the end,I dont get its purpose in the wax museum.The administration must try to improve it from display of the static figures to some interesting exhibition.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NaureenY
40,Amazing and Life-Like,What a nice place to visit. It is a three story exhibit of was figures that look life-like.They had figurines from the past and present. The price for an adult is approx $30. See if AAA has a discount or if a discount coupon is on the internet and if not then really go and see it.After that you can walk the area to see the Chinese Theatre. Parking is reasonable at the Kodak theater.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeorgeLinCPA
40,It worth a visit,My husband and i visited this place and we had lot of funs. If you buy your ticket online it will be cheaper. Also if you buy online ticket for start or finish hours you should pay only 18$ instead of 30$. So try to buy online ticket. It has 3 floors and in about 1 hour you can visit all 3 floors and take as many as photos you wish.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/351mehrnazs
50,Free entry with the hopper bus ticket,Feel been to 1 then you've seen it all. Like the interaction with props and you get the lift to top floor and walk down. Overall it's like any other and staff welcoming,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seagull021
50,Fun to see,We have never been to a wax museum so we decided to go and it was included in the LA Go Card. It is fun to see and would recommend to do once in a lifetime.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BZSooz
50,Very nice,We had a wonderful time here. Lots of waxed stars of the present and past.Unexpected promo coupon half off.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/narup0ns
50,Really Cool!,"Had 1 day to sightsee in Hollywood and after exploring the Walk of Fame, decided to go to Madame Tassauds and glad we did. We were actually handed some coupons for half off admission to the museum while we were taking some pictures in front of the Chinese Theater which is right next door. My wife and 2 teenagers loved the museum getting to see some of their favorite stars and taking tons of pictures. Some of the likenesses were so realistic it was kinda creepy but in a good way! It is nice that the museum lets you touch the wax figures (except for the hair) and you are able to be part of the scenes that are set up. Sit in the car from Grease next to John Travolta, pose with Sylvester Stallone wearing Rocky’s gloves and robe or ride the bicycle with E.T. in the basket. Even though it was not too crowded and there were only a few times that we had to wait for other tourists to finish taking pictures, plan on spending at least 60-90 minutes exploring the full 3 floors of the museum because there is so much to see. Would definitely go back!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EaglesFan11
40,Rub elbows with celebrities.,"Madame Tussauds is a fun place to go. You can get up close with very realistic celebrity. There are many figures for all ages. It is a good place to get some selfies or group pictures for the photo album. The line out front is long, but worth the wait.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/korndogizard
50,Loved it!,This was my first ever Tussauds experience... And what a morning!Very friendly staff and the premises were easy to navigate.The figurines were jaw droppingly impressive and really give a good indication as to how attractive the real people actually are!Take a camera! You'll regret it if not!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/snowfox92
50,So life like!,"Wow this is amazing! The detail in the sculpture are so life like. When you hear the time it takes to make one of these and by hand nonetheless. This was a great place, very interactive. You can touch everything. Hollywood can be a little hectic with all the tourist but this is definitely worth the visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TelliG_12
30,Madame Tussauds Hollywood,"My daughter and I visited Madame Tussauds museum on XMAS eve. The museum was crowded with tourist. The visit starts on the 3rd with ""present"" stars, on the 2nd floor there were past starts (my teen daughter did not recognize most of them) and not much on the first floor except for a huge gift shop and a small 3D movie theater (there is a 10 minutes movie which is worth watching).I bought the tickets online for $22.50. At the box office they were $30.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Meyrav
50,Best wax figures,the best in wax statues. Dont waste your time down the street.very goof friendly and helpful staff.Must see on the boulevard.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stephans482
40,A fun experience,We were in town and were exploring the Hollywood area. The museum is near the Chinese Theater and the Dolby theater.We decided to visit the wax museum and enjoyed our visit. We had purchased our tickets on line for $22.50 each.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ct-cruisers
40,A surprisingly good experience for the sceptic,"I reluctantly agreed to go with my two daughters, thinking it would be a ""plastic"", rather uninteresting experience. I was so wrong. We had tremendous fun posing along our favorite ""friends""! I was well worth the visit for any age.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarkLONDONUK58
40,Okay for one visit..,"This is a three(3) storyed building. Tour starts off on the third floor moving down to the second and ending on the first. Top floor has the wax statues do ""current"" celebrities like Brad-Angelina, Lady Gaga,Taylor Swift etc.. Second floor has most of the ""yesteryears"" stars and not really much on the first floor. First floor is mostly used up by gift shops,Starbucks and a small theater which runs a 10 minutes movie. Not quite the attraction it is made to look like. Not quite worth $30 per head ticket. There are better things and attractions to do in the same area...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Houstonian2008
40,So realalistic,"Madame Tussaud's is a great wax museum!You can take as many photos as you want & stay as long as desired.The figures are amazingly detailed, realistic...and some are almost creepy.***TIP*** I recommend you find some coupons as it is quite pricey.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thecompgalKim
30,For tourists,"I'd say if you haven't been to a wax museum before, Madame Tussaud's wax museum is something to see. The figures are amazingly detailed and I found the place a little spooky since some of the figures are super realistic. However, the tickets are quite expensive for getting a few selfies with wax celebrities. At the end the exhibition of how the wax figures are made is very interesting. You could also make a wax print of your hand for a price. However, it's a place you need to visit once in a lifetime just to see what it is.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/summeri94
50,So much fun a must see!,"3 levels of Stars to ""meet"" you will not be disappointed, so much fun and we took so many photos! You can take as many photos as you want, the only ones you pay for are the ""special effects"" ones that the staff take but you don't have to buy them, we didn't as we got plenty with the wax impressions. Very realistic, friendly staff too, oh and be sure to check out the 4D Marvel movie, goes for about 10 mins but lots of fun, moving seats, smoke effects, bubbles and water all in 4D! Would highly recommend and would go again!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kamejaje
50,So much fun!!!!,"What a fun place! My sister and I had a blast, posing amongst the stars. So life like. Some didn't look like themselves --that is NOT Audrey Hepburn -- but others were amazingly like the real thing. I thought it really was Steven Spielberg standing there.The 4D movie was great. We laughed ourselves silly. Such a great visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/95KarenH
50,Very life like figures,This is a must do when visiting Los Angeles. The life like resemblance the figures have is amazing. It's a family friendly attraction.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Divacrew1
50,Really cool and intresting,"This is a must do if your in Los Angeles/hollywood area. Its extremely cool to see the wax figures from James Bond to Alfred Hitchcock. Just a great place to go too. Spend about 1 hour and 30 minutes and that was enough to see it all. If you have any time, visit it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/761them
40,Interesting Place to Visit,Family enjoyed a couple of hours walking through and taking photographs with wax figures. Extensive range of celebs and interesting facts on how these wax figures are made.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Oztraveller97
40,Fun to do once,Used the Go Los Angeles Card to do this. Really cool seeing the detail in the wax figures. Many of them look really life like. Some of the figures how props to put on to wear while you take pictures with them. Took my family and my kids really liked it. They have a short Marvel 4D movie that was fun to watch(its an animation). Getting the LA Card made this worth it. Not sure if it would be worth doing for their actual price. Easily did this and the Warner Bros Studio tour with this pass. Went while they were setting up Star Wars premiere on Hollywood Blvd so very hectic getting there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Spudlydud
50,So life like,"Well what a day spent in here..had photos taken with Humphrey Bogart,Elizabeth Taylor,Marilyn Monroe and many so many more.The details of these mannequins are so life like its amazing..Michael Jackson looked so good as well as Patrick Swayze,Rocky,Bruce Willis and heaps more..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaryM493
50,"Be ""up close and personal"" with the stars","The detail that went into creating the life-size replicas of stars and celebrities is amazing. Down to the hairs in the beards and the dimples in the cheeks....these are true works of art! I found some of the heights and sizes of some of the figures to be surprising. Some of the ladies have waists as small as ""Scarlett O""Hara's"" and some of the guys are really tall....like Arnold Schwartznegger!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mimi0f10
30,Fun if you have the time,"Not as many models as we thought there would be, so somewhat underwhelming but still fun . If you are wanting to go,be sure to book online as its 30 percent cheaper than at the door and if you book before 12 on the day before your visit there's a further discount",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KimDomi
50,kids loved it,"We took our 13 and 6 yr old here and they loved it. The wax statues are so realistic. It was such good fun. I also got a deal at the door after speaking to one of the employees, which saved me quite a bit of money!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chelledavies75
50,Life-like Celebrities!,"If you've ever wanted to see and meet the celebrities up close and personal, this is the place to do it!

Take as many photos as you'd like and tell your friends that you got to meet the celebs!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H1564ONmattg
50,Great wax museum,"Every time we have family or friends come to visit, we take them to Hollywood. One of our favorite things to do is go to the Madame Tussauds Wax Museum. You can go up to each wax figure and put your arm around them for a picture. You are allowed to touch them everywhere except their faces. A lot of the figures have props that you can use for an amazing picture. They also have several professional photo opportunities set up throughout the museum. Don't be shy to ask someone to take a group shot of you and your friends, everyone is accommodating. You can definitely spend a few hours here. Check out their website for discount tickets. We always purchase our tickets online to avoid the crowds and for the discount price.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BME10
40,Pretty Awesome,It was pretty cool and you could touch the figures anywhere except the face so you could get some cool pictures. They had some props too so you could dress up for more fun. Kids love the dress up part. The lighting worked well for the pictures too. The Avengers 4D things was awesome but cartoon based not movie based.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rach340
40,First Visit to Los Angeles,"The Marvel 4D Experience alone is worth the price of admission. Next generation cinema experience, shows what is coming in cinema technology. The exhibits are great with unbelievable attention to detail and friendly courteous staff.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/549nv
30,Fun,"It's a fun place to go once. They have lots of people in the museum, but it's a tourist trap. I would go once just to say you went.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jmphotoblog
20,Not worth the time and money,"I suppose some people appreciate the ""art"" of making wax figures that look like well known people but personally I felt it was a waste of my time....and money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/buffalojim67
40,Fun in Hollywood,"Fun to do - pricey but with the 4-D show at end, bit of fun. Lots of photos opportunity including paying for some professional ones. Expensive but guess that's what you do on holidays",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JMR3564
50,Real Stars looks just like Stars :),"You would like to meet Stars but you just are nobody? Just go to Madame Tussauds and you can meet actors like Brad Pitt and Silvester Stallone, singers like Taylor Swift and Selena Gomez, stars like Real Stars. In the heart of Hollywood this impressing wax museum bring you to a journey of the best kind.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R5817JYmarcov
40,Loved it!,"Fantastic exhibit. Well laid out, great atmosphere. Good range of celebrities and also loved the explanation into how the characters were made.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nicolebT3893EA
40,Amazingly Lifelike Wax Figures!,"Madame Tussauds in Hollywood is such a fun place to visit. The wax figures are soooooooo life-like! It's exciting to see and take pics with so many of the figures on the various floors of the museum. Once inside, you are amazed at the celebrity likeness of each figure (Beyonce, Jennifer Lopez, Brad Pitt, Rocky (Sylvester Stalone, The God Father (Marlon Brando), Tiger Woods, Clint Eastwood, Eddie Murphy, Will Smith, Marilyn Monroe, Audrey Hepburn, and the list goes on and on and on!). I have been to this location numerous times (each time I have an out-of-town visitor), and each time feels like the first!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/skystar2
30,Fun attraction,"Very neat seeing all your favorite stars in their wax form. They look so real! Just a tip, we bought our tickets on their website and they were about 30% cheaper than buying them there!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kkeith34
40,Nice,"Very nice collection of characters. But you can't find at this location all that are advertised.The place is quite big but well maintained. Some of the staff are not so friendly, but the tickets guy was nice.The Avengers 4D in the end of the attraction looked poor in the beginning but turned out to be pretty cool.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnaCAlmeida1
30,Interesting!,"I decided to check it out after receiving a free ticket from taking a Starline tour. Although the wax figures were interesting to look at and take pictures with, I don't know if it's actually worth paying for. There wasn't as many figures as I expected. We were in and out in less than 30 minutes.Stop by if you can get in for a steal price (or better yet free) but I'd be reluctant to pay anywhere near full price admission. Just my two cents.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Schmosby
40,Fun Experience with a Discount,This is a fun place for family members of all ages. The wax figures are tastefully crafted and appeal to all age groups. I thought the price was a bit expensive for the tour but once we were inside we were offered to pay almost half the price using an employee's discounted rate for the entire family!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jamesmcfarland2015
50,Mind Blowing,"I always thought going to a wax museum wouldnt be that much fun. But boy was I wrong. The second I stepped foot into Madame Tussauds I knew I was in for a treat. Its not something I can explain, you just have to go and see for yourself. I swear these so called wax figures are the real deal. It is so believable that its insane. If you are in the rooms by yourself, you will not feel alone. These figures feel like real people. Its a little creepy but totally awesome!! They recreate scenes from movies and music performances and they leave some props so you can take pictures of yourself in the scene. Its so much fun. Please go here, its amazing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/287adelinat
50,You just have to go...,I am not terribly impressed with wax museums but this one is a must see. It has something for everyone...Where else can you be a gangster with Brando and then get hugged by Thor? They have a 4D theater that you just have to experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TLSelf
40,"Fun Time, Fairly Priced","I visited this establishment on 11/25. I purchased my tickets online which were 20% cheaper than prices at the door. The establishment was clean. The wax figurines were very life like. Simon Cowell was so well done it gave me the chills. The staff were very pleasant. The Marvel Super Heroes 4D show is a must see. It's at the end of the tour on the first floor. Seven (7) minutes in duration, the show was action packed and the theater is state of the art. It looks newly built.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/valeriew880
50,Meet all your favorite stars,The most interactive attraction in L.A. the figures are all so life-like and there for you to pose with. You can get as creative as you'd like some of the displays even have props for you to use in your photo's and at the end of the tour there's a 3-D show!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/603lailar
40,Great to kill a few hours,"This was available on our GO Los Angeles cards so we couldn't pass it up.Most of the figures here are very life like and realistic, maybe even sentimental for some. But there were a few characters who looked bloody awful and quite questionable.I wouldn't pay to get in, it's just that it was on our passes so we thought why not.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RoxieC814
30,Interesting but expensive,"The wax figures are very lifelike and well made and set up nicely over 3 small floors, but the entire experience was over priced, from the admittance to the photos at the end which are optional. It was an interesting experience for an hour, but we wouldn't return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Essa13
50,Amazingly life like!,"We had so much fun posing with the figures. They were so realistic & detailed. We had a great experience, I would go back again!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/261nikkij
40,Enjoyed it anyway,I hadn't planned to go but ended up with a free ticket so went and enjoyed it. I didn't think I would but it's pretty nifty. Worth an hour or so of your time if you are a bit of a Hollywood buff.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/788merriet
50,We really enjoyed,"Actually, we got tickets in package with the open bus tours and utilized it when we hopped off the bus there. We didn't expect much and good surprises just kept coming. Some of characters were real that I wasn't sure is there a prank or not: Simon Cowell, Lady Gaga, Beyonce, just to name a few of really good wax sculptures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kiwis2000
50,loved it,Was easy to get to. We went late afternoon and it wasnt busy at all. We got photos of celebrities who looked like the real thing. The celebrities were well spaced out and i loved the idea of having props for photos. Would highly recommend,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y5920KVdonnat
30,Good but quite expensive,We visited in 2014. The museum is good but the price was a bit high for a family outing. The kids did have fun looking at the sculptures of their favorite actors and idols.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PartyChefMan
50,So much fun,We had a great time posing with all the figures. We had hoped for more figures but what they had was intriguing. The parking garage was convenient as its right next to the Chinese Theater and there isn't much parking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/toshab379
50,Very interactive,Loved this place. Had lots of fun interacting. Plenty of stars to choose from and plenty of pictures to take. Lots of fun for the adults.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PamelaVio
40,Better than expected,Visited on the request of my son whilst in Hollywood. Got a good deal on the entrance price. Great wax works in the main. George Clooney disappointing but most were very life like.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LesleyYOrk2013
30,Just ok,"This is set over 3 floors. The wax figures are ok if this is your scene. Like London, I have been there once unlikely to make a return visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DebraH358

50,Meet and great with Hollywood's elite...sort of,"What a blast!Thought we were killing time between scheduled events, but it turned into a 3 hour tour.The guys had a great time trying to find ways to interact with the lifelike stars. We got a kick out of their antics and ideas.What a great way to spend a fun filled afternoon.Totally worth the money. We had a AAA discount!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/minnime
30,Standard entertainment of this type,If you been to the wax museums in the past there is nothing to be amazed by in here. Just usual collection of stars you can take picture with,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kopilashvili

50,Amusing,We enjoyed this little bit of Hollywood. It is very realistic and had fun guessing some of the characters. Take your camera.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lindawA6453NJ
40,Rub shoulders with the Stars.,"The whole family related to many of the various theme displays and the characters on display. Seeing Hollywood Stars , actually in Hollywood was Special.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rusty3350
30,Nothing extraordinary,"I have been hearing about Madame Tussauds since childhood, it was always a dream destination. Moreover, since I was travelling to California, I took suggestions from friends and this was a must see location in Hollywood.We planned our visit on Sunday with the group of friends and headed to Hollywood. We didn't buy the tickets online which was cheaper than the walk-in price. We purchased our tickets at 30$ each and took the tour.The exhibits are places in 3 floors and there aren't any restrictions to touch and take photos with them (except their hair & eyes). The collection here is everything related to Hollywood. Movie stars, Pop stars, Directors, TV Stars, Movie Characters, Hollywood Icons, Super Heroes and some Sportstars too.Though I was expecting that the collections would be a more varied including world leaders and global sportstars.The 4D experience with the Marvel super heroes was a great experience for the kids and the adults too.Overall it was a fun tour as you get a chance to click photos at your leisure and fun activity for close to 2 hours your spend there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bongfooodie
40,realistic,"Quite interesting and not just a number of waxworks, one of the better wax museums if a bit pricey with the photos, great memories.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/344garyt
30,Nothing special,There's nothing special about Madame Tussauds. They are all pretty much the same and not a lot happens. Do this if you have spare time and money otherwise not worth your time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kanetreloarofficial
40,A great time. Bring friends and a camera.,This is one of those attractions that you just have to see when your are in the area. Worth every penny.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/648jamesu
40,Great fun,Great fun with the family seeing all the famous faces and getting photos with all the stars also great you go at your own pace. Some of the stars look so real its amazing. No negatives about here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/747amies
50,"Very good experience, get the discounted coupon","This place located right at Chinese theater and walk of fame area, very good location and metro accessible. The place gets more new ones and updated. To visit here, you get to visit other popular places around and lots of tour bus giving out discount coupon so you may get on the bus then pay less for this museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adac1121
40,Cool place,"I loved this place. Visited with my friends kids and we had fun taking pictures and getting up close and personal with the ""stars"". I loved the pose at the Hollywood most wanted and the show at the end of the visit. Will like to visit again. Quite a lot of celebrities were missing though- Jlo, Oprah, etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Classychic
50,Nice way to see the 'stars',"We had a good time taking our photos with all the 'stars' we saw. Some stars are easily recognised, but with other stars, in our opinion, are not that realistic. Nevertheless we enjoyed our visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alice1571976

30,It's Madame Tussauds,"Right in the middle of the hollywood walk of fame. Good selection of hollywood movie stars, but not really my thing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2013thewanderer
40,Amazing,Do visit this place. It's really amazing place and fun. Would like to visit again. Take lots of pictures,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wadana
40,Celebrities and Marvel Action!,"We parked our car in the parkade of Hollywood Highlands next door to Madame Tussaud's and when we came out from the mall, an employee from Madame Tussaud's was on the street giving out 50% discount coupons (what a treat!). Once we got to the wax museum, Johnny Depp was there to greet us (wax figure of course)! All the staff there were really friendly, you even get to do a photo shoot before starting the tour. You could spend hours here if you love taking photos, especially with some of your favorite celebrities. At the end of the tour and before entering the souvenir shop, there was a Marvel superhero exhibit with a 4D short movie. Don't skip it, It's the highlight of the tour!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jenchtw
50,Great time at this atraction,"I found this attraction really entertaining posing with the figures. The added background music & props made it even better. I reccomend people to research tickets which give you several attractions to visit so you get a good deal. The only minor dissapointment I had, was wanting to pose with The Rock as I've known his statue has been there for years, however he wasn't there. I guessed it had gone or was under maintenance as he looks visually different now. I guessed correctly & had a laugh with the staff about it so i wasn't that dissapointed as I still got to pose with my other hero's, Rocky & Bruce Lee. If I was to make a a few suggestions, it would be to try & improve the stars skin colors to make them more realistic as almost all the sculptures had a yellowish skin color. I asked the staff if they had an example of how the green background picture would look (they try & sell it to you as you begin the tour) before i bought it, but they didnt. I also asked another staff member about the pricing of another photo but they said they didn't know, it was other staff who deal with that. Communicating this info for the staff to give the guests, would be awsome. Overall it was a great attraction to go & visit & I would highly reccomend it. The staff were really friendly & actually went out of their way & asked me if I wanted a picture taken with the waxworks. They gave excellent customer service.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Intercontinental100
40,Great Photo Ops,"The place is easy to get to, right next to the Chinese Theater. The wax statues were very realistic, and provide for some great photos. Some of my favorite from our trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BucksCoTravel
50,Spot the star!,We had so much fun interacting with the wax figures and got some priceless photos with them. A fun day out where you can 'rub shoulders' with the stars.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SVKaz
50,Lots of fun with an added bonus!,"This is a great way to spend the afternoon in Hollywood. Not only do you get to take photos with all your favourite stars & artists, but you also get to watch a fantastic 4D movie before you leave! Don't miss it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/404AnneS404
40,Get your picture with the stars,This wax museum is located conveniently right on the walk of fame. The figures are very life-like and many have props nearby that you can use when taking pictures with them.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/450joya
40,It's a bit spooky staring into the eyes of the wax sculptures.,"Once you have paid your ticket you can be photographed against a green screen for various poses, before taking the lift to the 3rd floor. The main bit of advice I can give you is to read the info boards for each celebrity after you have taken all of the usual goofy poses with your favourite star. It helps to give you a better picture of their early life (did you know that Marilyn Monroe worked in a munitions factory when spotted for the silver screen?). The top floor is mainly contemporary actors, musicians and celebrities.From the top floor you go downstairs to 2nd level which has the old Hollywood stars like Marilyn Monroe and John Wayne. The final floor (1st) has action heroes and sports stars, plus Obama and the Marvel comics stars.At the end of the tour on 1st floor you can go into the 4D movie experience, which is not my scene, but a big hit with the kids (includes scary seat mechanics, water spray, and ??? spoiler alert. Just say I warned you.Last stop (of course) is the gift shop and snacks, with Starbucks conveniently next door for a hot drink. All up I did the whole lot in 90 minutes but if you want to take shots of everyone in your family group, better allow 2 hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/williamsN3015EP
40,Melting Moment,"Bit of fun had with these silent stars! Be a great place for an actor to play a prank, because they are freakingly real looking!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlendaH709
40,As wax museums go.....,"It's a good one! I never really understood the attraction to a wax museum, but I went here for an event and it was pretty fun. It's cool to see the actual physical size of the subjects, and the set up is much more open than your traditional wax museum. Go to the Hollywood Highland Red Line station and look for the people giving out discount tickets to the museum. Half price!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnRyan724
40,Enjoyable,Had a nice visit to the wax museum . Some of the figures are more lifelike than others but overall the museum and the figures where cool !,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jahmai
50,Fun!!,"I have to admit I have NEVER been to a Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum, because I thought it was dumb! But, on our recent weekend in LA my cousin took us here and it was FUN! We had a great time taking funny pictures with the wax statues and just having a good time. Tickets were $30 which I thought was a lot, but over all there was a lot to see and we did have a great time. I am not sure I would go back again, but to spend an hr or two in the afternoon is worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GuidaS266
40,Similar to other cities,"If you have seen one, you have seen them all. Good fun for a few hours but it starts to get repetitive. But definitely worth one visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deejay90210
50,Great fun!,"This place is great for some light hearted fun for an hour or two. We parked below the shopping mall next to it and it was only a minute or two to the place on foot. We chose to go after 5pm, this is cheaper than the day ticket and what's good about it is that it's a lot quieter. This gives you much more room and time to get photos with the models. There are props like hats and clothes next to a lot of the models and you can really ham it up and have a laugh. There are three floors so there are lots of famous people young and old to see.You can sit next to Forrest Gump on the bench, you can join Charlie Chaplin with a bowler hat and walking cane and so much more. For families it's really fun and I will remember it for ages. Not to mention the Facebook remarks when I posted tmy photos up for other people's entertainment. Well worth a visit.It's right next to the handprints of the stars so if you haven't done this either you can do both at the same time. If you walk to the back of the open shopping centre beside it you can see the Hollywood sign in the hills too. Yes it's a typical tourist spot but it's Hollywood and you should do it once. I loved it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sasagnew
40,Lovely afternoon,A great way to spend the afternoon and once you have seen it you would probably not return although we have seen a few in different countries now,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Michael168
40,Waxy wax,I was on a high as this was my first stop in America. Hollywood and into the wax museum. I was so impressed with the quality of the subjects and the photo system worked quite well and there wasnt much of a line up. However a couple more staff members in the museum to take photos of visitors would of been good.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/304kirkt
50,So much fun! I really loved the props to help enhance photos!,"Had a fantastic time here with my dad on his first visit to Hollywood. Lots of great ""celebrities"" to take photos of and with. They had some great props to enhance your photos and the staff is very friendly and helpful. I would come back here again in a heart beat. You can expect to spend between 1-2 hours here (you can stay as long as you like) it is right near the walk of fame, Graumans, Dolby Theater, and many other tourist attractions. I love the one here in NY, but had a great time here too. Great job on the wax figures-really high quality and look just like the people they are supposed to :) A must see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BubbaSmiley
50,Love it!,"Its cheaper if you buy the tickets on their website, its $21.95. I have been to the one in Vegas but I love this one better. I took an awesome picture with Shrink right in the front of the building. This is really fun. Be careful walking on Hollywood blvd my friend got her purse pick pocketed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/136kaylaw

40,Great experience!,"When we booked the Starline City Sight Seeing Tours, we received complementary tickets to Madame Tussauds. It’s located next to the Chinese theatre and the walk of fame, and we thoroughly enjoyed walking through the three storey museum; posing and taking photos with the wax replicas of famous Hollywood stars, reminiscing about the movies they’ve made and, of course, quoting some of the famous lines. Basically, it was a wonderful chance to play around a bit! My favourites? George Clooney, Elvis, Antonio Banderas and Robin Williams.

40,Such a cool experiance,"The wax figurines looked so life like! This was such a fun place to visit. We had purchased the LA GO Pass and so entering was fun and a breeze. I also loved that they had you start at the 3rd floor and work your way down. There was a guy at the end in the photo viewing area who was a jerk, so we decided to bypass buying any photos.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ditzgrl02

40,Enjoyable time filler,We did not overly enjoy our day spent in Hollywood however this was our highlight! It's very interesting to see how realistic some of the wax figures are and a good laugh to take a few funny photos with them.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Misstraveller1993
50,Loved this place,This is likely as close as you'll ever get to a celebrity. The museum did a fantastic job on making the wax figures so life like. Leonardo DiCaprio was my fave of course :),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SherrySwirl
30,Kind of neat to see!,"We went here as apart of a hollywood explorer pass we purchased, I don't think I would go back but there, but some people who went there 3 times in a week...not sure why but lots of people have fun taking selfies with the wax figures. They also have props you can put on to take pics with the figures...hopefully they wash them often. Some of the figures look really real and others you can tell they are a wax figure. But it is pretty impressive and it is very detailed...birth marks, tatoos etc. At the end of the tour you can purchase a your own waxed hand...its a bit pricey but great for kids. Its basically just paraffin wax they use to make the hand.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/venisonking
30,"Interesting and fun, but total tourist trap.","We wouldn't have even gone here, but we got free entry by booking our Celebrity Homes tour through Starline Tours.

50,Great fun!,"I went with my friend on a girls trip...we had a blast! I really liked the props/scenery available to take pictures with and the figures are VERY realistic. I was surprised that it was not busy at all (likely from them only allowing so many people in at a time) so we had plenty of space/time to take pictures without everyone watching or being in the way. There was a good variety of new and old singers, movie stars, characters, etc. and the 4D movie was fun. We used $10 off coupons printed from the internet but afterwards saw other available deals that would have been cheaper (eg. combining it with other attractions, etc). Take lots of pictures!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/simoneaw
40,It's Fun,"You will see near real statues of a lot of Hollywood stars and other celebrities. It is a good 2-3 hours fun. If you have not visited any other Madame Tussauds museum, then this a must do here; as there isn't much to do activities nearby anyways.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/imhuzefa
40,So life-like!,"We had so much fun here at MT...from the realistic wax figures, to the props you can use or wear to assist with that PERFECT photo - it was just so much fun! From Tupac to Beyonce, to President Obama, and John Travolta complete with a car and fun ""pink ladies"" jackets you could wear for your photo! My daughter had a picture taken with E.T which was hilarious - sitting up on the bike with E.T in the front basket and a red hoody for my daughter to wear to set the scene...very cool place. The 4D mini movie was a bonus also. And what a nice addition having a starbucks right outside when you're finished! A must do!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lindatomokino
30,OK but irritating to get inside....,"After paying, we were forced to stand in a line of people waiting to get some sort of amusement photo taken against a green screen. We made it known that we didn't care for the photo and just wanted to go in and walk around but were told we had to stand in the line anyway so the staff could ""explain the rules"" to us. Said explanation amounted to ""Don't touch the faces of the wax figures"" and instructions on where the exit was. That's it. Could just put that on a sign on the wall or have the ticket seller mention it and not compel people to waste their time in needless lineups for things they don't want.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Elwood2012
50,Amazing wax figures - rubbing shoulders with the stars,Amazing wax figures waiting your poses and photos. Much the same as other venues around the world just different characters.

30,Should visit if have never been to Madame Tussaud before,Madame Tussaud is good to try if you have never been there before. Though the one in London is the best one to go. And you have been there you can easily avoid this. Can cover this place in around 2 hours,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Iwshere

50,Madame Tussaud's - closest I've gotten to a star lol,The wax museum is a great place to stop when you are in LA if you have time and are downtown near the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Be sure to check the hours online as they do fluctuate but they are very accommodating and what you see is worth the couple hours it will take. The figures are sooo lifelike and you can even use some of the provided props to get some great photos of your trip. This was DEFINATELY money well spent!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jaleenmrss

40,Enjoy and strike a pose,We had been given free admission by starline tours on our honeymoon. It was worth the visit and we were allowed to get up close to the models. It was cool that you could see just how big or small they were in real life. Some props were provided at stands so you could get into character. Enjoyed the visit and worth trying another one.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hwnew
50,So cool!,The wax figures at Madame Tussaudes are absolutely incredible! They look so real! So real that they blend in with tourists!If you're in Hollywood and want to go to a wax museum then this is the one! They are amazing!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kahliaw2015

40,Go there for the 4D theatre movie,It's like all the other MTs and a little more I think. We had fun in the 4D Theatre which was new. Have been to the MT in Vegas and London but they did not have the 4D Theatre.We did the celebrity car tour and they gave us entry tickets to MT as complimentary,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AGeeKay
40,Fun!,"I like wax museums and I have also been the Madame Tussaud's in Amsterdam. The museum worker at the entrance was very clear as to what we could and could not touch and where to start the tour and in what order.I liked that I could take photos with the ""stars"", and many of them are very realistic. I also liked the added props that allow you fit in with the character, such as a Zorro hat or the Pink ladies jacket.My only complaint is that while the figures are spaced out and there are 125 (or around that), it didn't take that long to visit and I think it would be nice to have some more figures.There are also those people who have to take 500 (slight exaggeration) photos with one figure, making a crowd form when other people want a turn. Not the museums fault of course but maybe a museum worker could try to limit the number of photos taken. this was especially a problem at the display with the Avengers characters and wolverine. I know its popular but everyone wants a picture with Thor, myself included.We had a great time taking photos and looking into the very realistic eyes of the figures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TMD83
30,Solo Female Traveler,"Some figurines look great, some I had to read the plaque to see who it was. Penelope Cruz, Carrie Underwood, Angelina Jolie and Leo DiCaprio were terrible. Tom Hanks, Robin Williams, Dustin Hoffman, Lady Gaga, John Travolta and Jamie Foxx were really good. Marilyn Monroe and Joan Rivers were not great. It was difficult to find your way around and the museum is not clearly marked on how to move to the next level. You have to take an elevator to the third floor and work your way down via stairs- which is all fine and good if you can find them. I had to ask on both levels how to get to the next level. It took me less than 15 minutes to tour the entire establishment.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GoGurl1
40,FUN TIME,Loved the buy one get one free ticket we had. It made the experience much nicer. lol My mom and I had a great time going through the exhibits. Have fun getting silly with some of them.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2travelersasof2001
40,Very realistic,I had never been to a Madame Tussaud's before so this was definitely an experience! The figures are so realistic enough! Heaps to choose from and lots of fun to be had.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/georgi_woods
40,Top tourist attraction spot,"Weekdays are way less crowded. It only took about few minutes waiting in line to get on the elevator.3 floors on this location. Started with 3rd floor then follow the route to first floor... ended with 4D show then exit to the gift shop. Great layout! You won't miss anything.Only 3rd floor has some seating area. Restroom on 3rd floor as well. On 2nd floor, there is a water fountain. On 1st floor, there is hand wax station for purchase.There are a few photo spots (e.g. Obama, ET, etc), their staffs will take pictures for you. However, those are for purchase only. Pretty pricey too.Lots of picture opportunity. Bring your selfie stick with you!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ILoveFoodComa
40,Wax People..…....YaY,"My husband and I received two free tickets to the wax museum after taking a lack-luster tour of celebrity homes. I'm not really interested in where people live, but I do enjoy beautiful scenery, of which there really was none except for the park in Beverly Hills. Anyway, the wax museum was nice. We were allowed to take pictures and there was a good mix of old and new figures along with still recreations of classic movie scenes. I would definitely go there again if I had free tickets. Would I pay the fee they're asking to get in there......NO. Almost $70 for a couple to see a few wax figures is a bit redick to me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/caroleem99
40,Love the place,"It's really funny to play around with the wax celebrities :)I dont think the place is different than other Museum around the world, but I know the English one has better experience and fun ending tour :)If you enjoy taking funny pictures then dont miss it",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amiraazmia
40,It looks like a real picture of you and Johnny Depp,Great place when you have people visiting from out of town. My friend and I had an absolute blast. I think I even found a groupon to use before she came out. Well worth it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/497nelliem
50,Feel like meeting a celebrity,It is really good experience if you were not lucky enough to get a celebrity siding while staying in LA. They have very friendly and helpful staff,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alexandra_Zhiltsova
40,Meet your famous Hollywood stars,Meet all your famous Hollywood stars almost looking real in wax statues. Best place to have pictures with your favourite one. One of the best Museum from Madame Tussad located on road of walk of fame. Take Metro to Hollywood highland to reach quickly.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Deepak1708
40,"It's ok, if you haven't been to a bigger one.","It's ok. Once you've visited the on in London, you probably won't be that impressed by this one. But it was a free visit for us, having bought a Celebrity tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YanaN738
50,Fun time!,It took awhile to go through but worth it! I loved all the accessories used to pose with the figures.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TamiM506
40,A very nice visit !,Visiting madame tussauds was a very nice experience. There was many celebrities to see and also different sections (my favorite was the marvel section with marvel 4D experience). You begin the visit on the 3rd foor and you will explore each floor until you get back to GF. I recommend madame tussauds especially if you've never been to one in other countries.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Anthonynassar96
50,Unexpectedly fun,Got free tickets with a celebrity homes tour and thought might as well use them but had such a laugh - you're allowed to get more up close and personal with the waxworks than I remember being allowed to in London (though take a deep breath and be patient cos there's always someone who goes too far!),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barley3487
40,Good if you haven't been before,"This was ok - I really feel that if you have been to one Madame Tussauds, you've been to them all and after being to the one in London multiple times and the one in Sydney, there wasn't a lot of new things to see. There are some good passes going in combination with the Hop On Hop Off bus though so it is definitely worth doing if you haven't been to one before. We were a bit disappointed that we got ushered into a show and then when it was over we were at the exit and couldn't go back, despite not seeing the last floor.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TimandKath
40,Awesome!,"Fantastic organisation and set up, lots of different celebrities to see with interesting poses and backdrops. Loved the times when you could put on a piece of costuming to take photos, was a lot of fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ckay92
40,Lots of fun,"NOTE: Get the $8 off coupon from the the local Hollywood magazine (available in our hotel's lobby) before you go.We enjoyed visiting the museum and the quality of the exhibits was AMAZING. The reasons we didn't give 5 stars are that 1) We thought $30 for a ticket was rather pricey and 2) There is a ""Senior Discount"" sign posted, but they DON'T give a senior discount.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GrayChurch
30,Nothing new here,"Part of a 3 attraction deal with Ripley's Believe It or Not, and Guiness Book of Records Madame Tussaud's offers numerous rooms with a variety of celebs depicted Most displays are somewhat dated",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ellynvb
40,Nothing to write home about.,"We had admission as part of the hop on hop off buses. Had we not we probably wouldn't have gone. Prices to get in are quite high, so if you have seen a MT in the past then i wouldn'd bother, not much changes. They don't have a Kylie, disappointing. Very good though, but nothing to write home about.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnmK3466KN
50,family tussauds,Always lots of fun & a great way to check out the stars......excellent variety with lots of fun props.....,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emmas951
50,A fun experience and great fun photo opportunity!,"We went in Madame Tussauds because we had some spare time and it was included on our LA go card. We had an amazing time. We hardly had to queue very long which is always a plus. There is a good selection of wax works - both recent and classic. You are allowed to go right up to them and touch them apart from the hair and face. They also provide props for fun pictures. I was impressed that although we went in August it wasn't over crowded and we had space to walk around and get pictures. It was very different from visiting London's Madame Tussauds during peak season, where you find yourself walking around with the crowd and there being too many people to get proper pictures. I would definitely recommend a visit if you find yourself with a spare hour or so in Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ZoeZoeC
50,Recommended trip,"Very real, and a very fantastic experience. There are some places in the museum that are extremely scary and real.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/juanm686

40,UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL WITH THE STARS!,"Madame Tussauds – a tourist attraction, is a wax museum of realistic figures of famous celebrities and is located on Hollywood Boulevard. It is part of the Tussauds franchise set up by sculptor Marie Tussaud – there are totally 9 locations all over the world. The three-storey bldg. cost $.55 million and took 8 yrs. to complete - the cost of making each figure is approx. $300,000 (USD). You are greeted at the entrance by the figures of Marilyn Monroe and Jack Nicholson and take the elevator to the 3rd floor and walk down. On Level1 it is very interesting to see how the figures are made. Beyonce, Rihanna, Clint Eastwood, Angelina and Brad, and Elizabeth Taylor are the other highlights – there are so many, including Barrack Obama (not realistic though we shook hands with him), posed with Charlie Chaplin (amongst others) and clicked some great pics. Staff are very helpful and will take your pics if you request them. Each figure has a placard placed near it giving information on the personality depicted. Shrek is the biggest figure in the museum. There were also classic movie characters... Forrest Gump, Grease, Silence of the Lambs etc. Do not touch the face or hair of the wax figures – costumes can be felt. They also had a ""4D"" experience showing at the end of the museum – which was really nice. They have a gift shop. Try and get discounted entry tickets beforehand (Groupon, Travelzoo, etc)., since otherwise a bit pricey. We spent about two hours there. They have a garage underneath, so this was convenient. Visit preferably on a weekday.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/812jp
40,Visiting the stars,Great entertainment although expected more stars. Most good but feel Sydney tussauds is better. Still enjoyed it very much though.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DebbieFyfe
50,Good detail.,"All the figures are such good quality, it's fascinating. You keep waiting for one to turn and look at you!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/12jessn
40,Great Place to be!,"My family had a great fun being their. It is much smaller then many other locations they have world wide. Like one in London, Las Vegas etc. But it has some good wax statues of good celebrities. Location is very good. Good value for the money but wish it could be little cheaper.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/647sanjay
40,Fun attraction for the whole family,The little ones always enjoy seeing some of their favorite actors and celebrities as well as grown adults. There is a little bit for everyone and also offers some fun photo ops.We all had a fun time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/phdedieu
50,A Must See!!!,"I have been looking forward to this visit and I was not disappointed. They just look so real. I just sat and stared in awe. I think that they cover a broad range of celebrities so everyone from young and old can relate. Take plenty of pictures as your encouraged to interact with the wax figures, there are even props for you to do so. Check out DestinationCoupons for $10 off coupon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iJennine
40,"Touristy, but nice","Sure it's a tourist-trap, but I have to say that it was still enjoyable. Not only modern celebrities were featured, but also some of the classic Hollywood icons, like Marilyn Monroe, John Wayne and James Dean. Several of the wax figures have attached accessories for the visitors to create nice photo opportunities (ie. hat and cane next to the Charlie Chaplin figure).Definitely a nice place to escape the heat and hassle of Hollywood Blvd. for an hour or so.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RainyTravelJunkie
50,Such a Wonderful Place to Visit,"I loved this place!!! It was so fabulous to see the life like wax statues. I think this is a great place for the entire family and right in the middle of Hollywood Blvd. I recommend that if you do go, check online deals for tickets and go on a week day when there are less people. We went as soon as it opened up and were in and out in less than two hours and took photos through out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KCBrock
30,"It was okay, not up to the hype!",It was a good exhibit but did not live up to the hype. The guy letting you in was an idiot (or a robot),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnnaNZ91
40,Get your ticket before you go!,"Deffinitly best to get your ticket online and print it out at home before going to Madame Tussauds. When we got there on a hot late morning, we were able to skip the entire line because we already had our tickets readily available. I have been to the New York one, and in my opinion Hollywood has the better wax figures. This is a great place to take some fun pictures with your friends / family and its a nice break from being outside. Most of the wax figures were realtively new and extremely well done. There was a few old ones but at least its nice to see the difference in quailty LOL.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amandah62
40,Fun to take pictures,"It's fun to take pictures with the figures. At the beginning and some locations, the staff would offer to take pictures for you and scan your photo card (provided). At the end, the photos would be shown to you, so you could decide if you want to buy them or not. It really depends on how much you like them or if you got them on your own camera.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Meeyoru
40,Good to see Hollywood stars,Been to the one in London and this was not as good. Quite a few Hollywood stars but did seem rather small. Enjoyed the exhibit that showed how the wax figures were made featuring Beyonce- amazing process and result.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B8866VKjuliem
30,Good but small,"It is Madame Tussauds as usual. This one is Hollywood oriented exhibition no political figures except for President Obama. Overall it is nice but small, buy your ticket online it is 20% cheaper than box office.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlmudhhiS
40,Nice exhibits,"My family visited this wax museum during a Saturday afternoon and had a good time checking out the wax figures and nice settings. There was 15 minute wait to get our tickets, and we were able to use a 30% off coupon (which a street solicitor handed me in front of the museum entrance). You start on the 3rd floor, and work your way down to the first floor. The wax figures look so real, with most of the celebrities looking like you'd expect. A good mix of old classic actors (e.g., Charlton Heston, Jimmy Stewart) and newer ones (Beyonce, Justin Bieber) as well as athletes and politicians. There's also a 4D movie experience which is included at the end of the exhibit that was quite entertaining. Definitely a nice break from the hot summer heat and mobs of people on the walk of fame street.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cohoman
40,i enjoyed it with my family,"very nice..but not as good as the one in Amsterdam, i dont know why but i just had so much fun last year in Amsterdam. i loved john travolta and silvester stalone. nice place to visit and take photos. i booked online it was nearly 5 dollars cheaper. and i think that afternoon tickets are cheaper",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/998mohamede
40,"Good wax museum, but still a wax museum","Located right in the middle of the complete bedlam that is Hollywood Blvd. Nice thing about Madame Tussaud's compared to other wax museums that I've visited is the lack of glass cases and stand-offish velvet ropes. Get right up there and take a selfie with Michael Jackson if you want. Like all wax museums, the figures range form perfect reproductions to ""I'm not sure who that even is"". Overall it is about a one hour or so visit, but includes an optional 4D superhero movie experience at the end that was 10 more minutes of corny fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/debotravel44
40,Easiest way to meet Hollywood Stars ;),"It was my first visit to any of the Madame Tussauds Museum.As i got the entrance ticket for free with my LA tour bus.There i was a bit amazed with beautiful wax sculptures right from Jim Carrey to David Beckham,Arnold Schwarzenegger,Rocky and the blessed couple of Bradd Pitt Angelina Jolie and many more.It was overall fun to see those wax statues.Not exactly a must do thing in LA but if you have time or free tickets don't miss it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kvs3130
50,This is the wax museum to see in Hollywood,"Madame Tussaud's is a first-class, clean operation, and they are very hospitable. They do offer deals online, for CA residents, and in conjunction with Starline Tours, motels, and the Christmas in Hollywood store. This business is connected not only with worldwide Madame Tussaud's locations, but also with Legoland in San Diego.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/86michealb
50,More than I expected!,"I was in Los Angeles and it was raining, believe it or not! My family decided to go indoors into Madame Tussads wax museum. There were lots to see and tons of opportunities to take photos with popular stars. The vast majority were real-life looking. There were only a few that didn't pass the ""test"". A must for families visiting LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JRRosa
40,Small but very interesting,"I expected more in the land of attractions and stars , but was amazed by the selection of stars likeness to what we view in movies and TV . Are they really all that slim and tall ?Great place to get amazing photos and probably as close you will get to photos with so many stars in one place",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/reviewermen
30,Not as big as expected,This exhibit was not as big as we expected even though it is over 3 floors. The figures are very good and in most cases very life like and you can get some good photos. We went later in the afternoon and it was not as busy as we had thought it would be. Also did it as part of a go ticket so we had good value. Park in Hollywood school it was only 10 dollars for the day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joep735
50,Pretty cool and life like,I have also been to the ones in Las Vegas and Sydney Australia. They do have some of them same people but this one had a lot of photo opportunities that the staff took for you to buy at the end which was excellent and the price was reasonable also. I would do it again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/153ericas
50,Amazing!,I bought the tickets online and went at 5:30 on a Thursday. There was no line. The wax figures are amazingly realistic and you can use props to take photos with them.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CiciZe
30,Could Be Better,"I expected more, considering this branch is in the heart of Hollywood. If you've been to a Madame Tussaud's before, a lot of the models are the same.We went at quite a busy time and the rooms still felt quite empty. I thought there would be a lot more models and sections. You can get through the whole place quite quickly, we tried to waste as much time as we could to get our money's worth.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andrewjcg
50,coming to life...,my second time here and a lot of celebrity wax look-alikes were added. I love the Marvel Superheroes and Katniss of the Hunger Games. Dont miss the mini-show at the end of your tour.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mandarin_mom
50,So much fun.,I did Hollywood Wax Museum first and was really disappointed. Then decided to do this one and after 7pm it is much cheaper and so worth it. Many more wax figures in here and lots of room to take pictures and to just take your time and look around. The new mini movie (10min) of Marvel in 4d is great. A definite must.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leeannb413
50,Great fun,Fantastic and fun-filled visit. Though smaller than its counterparts in other places but still as much fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anmol89
50,Fun from top to bottom,"It is exactly what it says, a wax museum, but it is also a touchstone to the past, giving people one more chance to see people they grew up seeing on tv and movies up close. It covers a good cross section of actors and some of them are so life like it is spooky! Just a fun place to spend an afternoon out of the heat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/211careyw
40,Wax fun,"Visited as we had the LA GO pass, we enjoyed having photos with the wax works and interacting with the exhibits",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/647davep
40,"Not as big as others, still a lot of fun","Though not as big as some of its cousins, this is still a very good branch. In keeping with its Hollywood location, the focus is on local movie celebrities. Most of the statues are great as usual though some (Audrey Hepburn, Ingrid Bergman, etc) could be better. It is a rather short visit though (I took a late visit ticket for after 7PM - I recommend this option as the museum was not crowded at all at this time).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tripasucks
20,Really needs some TLC!,"Our teenage daughters really wanted to see the stars. Our best bet was to take them to the wax museum.It was easy to get in, the line went quick.The statues were very lifelike and of great variety.I do feel that some of them should be touched up.... Especially the hands. I am sure it is from hands touching their hands. Perhaps some more current stars and maybe even some reality show stage set ups??? American Idol, the Voice, Americas Got Talent...Also, they need to have more props and make the exhibit more interactive.I would spend your time and money elsewhere until they do an update.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TammyH222
40,Fun family trip,Took a family trip to L.A. and thought we would stop in and check out the stars. My husband and I took our 9 year old girls and they loved it. It's not very big but we still enjoyed taking pictures with out favorite stars. The 3D movie was a nice surprise. We would definitely stop here again the next time we are in L.A.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Briannabanana83
50,Right across from the Hollywood Roosevelt,Location A+! Quality of wax figures A++ as I have seen some really bad wax figures in my day. No one but Madame's comes close to capturing Marilyn's facial features.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/537jenniferp
50,Creepy at first then a lot of fun,We got there around 11:30am and it was empty. This was perfect for us because then we weren't waiting to take pictures and got through in about an hour. I can definitely see it taking longer if there are a lot of people inside and you want to take a picture with a popular sculpture.The whole first floor I was kind of creeped out by them because of how real they look. By the second floor I loosened up and had a lot of fun being silly and taking pictures withy the sculptures.We definitely enjoyed our time here. Since we went on the starline stars home tour we were able to get a package and Madame Tussaud's ended up only being $5 a person so look into that!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alyssa630
50,Free Visit,"We managed to get free tickets to this by booking our hollywood homes tour whilst on honeymoon, my husband had never visited a madame tussauds before and we had a good laugh while pretending we was best friends with all the celebs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Terri-AnnC
50,Fun!,"Here's my best advice for you: get there when they open. We were there first thing in the morning and almost had the place to ourselves. Second Piece of Advice: go ahead and act like a kid. Mingle with the celebrities, put on a cowboy hat with John Wayne, peek behind the shower curtain to pretend you're in Psycho with Hitchcock directing. Yes, the ticket price is high, but, if you're going, have fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DaisyB7
40,Tussauds.. Small but good,Was in MT last week and took the walk around. It's split into 3 floors and you start on the top and go the way down. A lot of celebrities is here from old western to newbies as Selena Gomez. If you ever been at MT in London this place is a lot smaller. There is no movie experience as in London. You just to go through the dolls. Walk slowly. It's over fast... At the entrance by the ticketsale they sell selfiesticks for 20$.. If you want a stick spare yourself the money and buy it next door for 5$ at the souvenir market.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stinnastinna
40,Unique,This was our first visit to Tussauds ever and although it was very interesting I probably will only do it once this life time.I did find it very interesting but I imagine all the Tussauds are the same and or very similar.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KimmyR23
50,Mixing it with the stars,"A great day out with the stars. That's what it felt like to roam the red carpet with Hollywood's a listers. We met Brad and Angelina, sat and had a chat with George. Played golf with tiger and talked quantum physics with Tony Stark. All kidding aside, these wax works are a fine display, laid out well and great photo opertunities for the family. We used the LA pass which got us access and a must for any tourists that plan a few trips in LA. We then went and spent the rest of the day at knotts berry farm, less queues and great rides for all the family. A great day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/659neilg
50,good,As you all must be knowing this is the place where you get to see wax statues of your favourite stars and personalities. we really had a nice time clicking pics with almost all the statues. my daughters 9yrs and 3 yrs old also enjoyed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JAGATPARIKH
40,Fun. Better than expected,"I wasn't really interested in seeing wax figures of celebrities so a visit to Madame Tussauds was not planned. My friends have been to one in London so they weren't that interested either. However, we were given free tickets so we went anyway.I wasn't very excited at the first part with just the celebrity figures but I liked the second part which has the movie characters with the movie background. It started getting entertaining for me when I saw figures from the movies - The Godfather, Forrest Gump, Start Trek, Grease, Kill Bill, etc.It was entertaining and we ended up having fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lourdesf920
40,"Not Quite What Was Expected, But Very Good","We took our granddaughter to Los Angeles and she wanted to see the One Direction display in a wax museum. Online Madame Tussaud's indicated the One Direction exhibit was available in Hollywood.We purchased discounted tickets online which we supposed to be good for VIP entry. there wasn't much of a main line and the VIP line wasn't open. We got in after about a 10 minute wait.What we expected: Lots of excellent wax renderings of stars, celebrities and VIP's - though not as many as we had hoped.What we didn't expect: No One Direction - depending on who we asked the display was in Washington DC, San Diego, or London. We also did not expect to be able to take pictures next to the likenesses. This was a very nice touch.At the end of the tour there is a 20 minute movie that was promoted as ""4D"". We figured, why not. We picked up our 3D glasses as we entered. When seated we noticed a little panel in front of each seat. There was also a length of little rubber tubing hanging by one end from beneath the seats. The movie was about the Avengers. The 4D was not about the fourth dimension (time). Instead it was about shaking seats, spraying water, smells and the feeling of little critters skittering through you feet. In short, it was fantastic - almost worth the admission by itself.We highly recommend this place. It is well worth the time and expense.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jcstich
50,Very charming place and so life-like,"My wife and I have been to Madame Tussauds before and other wax museums and in fact we went to the one right down the street but they all pale in comparison to Madame Tussauds Hollywood.It is unbelievable how some of the figures appear too real. The Jackie Chan figure intrigued my Chinese wife but upon closer inspection, it wasn’t really that good. The Joan Rivers figure was incredibly life like. The props that are there for use with your picture is a great touch such as the robe next to the Rocky wax figure.Unfortunately there were a few people who wanted to just zip right past us and we would let them but people really should learn how to act in public before going out. In any case we loved it and it was worth about a hundred silly but fun pictures. She really tricked out her parents in China by telling them she met so and so and they believed her. It was priceless.You can get a ticket for Tussauds and 2 other places of interests and they are a block from each other for 30 bucks a person, so it was an excellent deal.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G3743BSdaniela
50,MUCH BETTER THAN EXPECTED,"The children insisted and I relented expecting a wasted 100 bucks but I really enjoyed the tour. Some of the models are incredibly lifelike and exactly like the character (Butch Cassidy and Sundance were perfect).You can touch the exhibits and have your photo taken with them which allows for some fun shots and there is a good selection of modern day and yesteryear characters to suit everyone.With the children we went early evening but I would guess that this would be great fun for adults after a couple of drinks at night after dinner.Of course it is pure tourist, but well worth the money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarolBahamas
40,Well worth the visit,We were initially unsure if we wanted to spend some of our very short time in LA visiting Madame Tussaud's. We spoke to the guy at the front who assured us that it would be worth it. He also gave us a family discount. We enjoyed it so much we stayed inside for nearly 3 hours. It was great and the kids loved it as well. We took photos of nearly all the wax figures! The likeness was amazing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RowD2192
40,Fun activity - see the stars up close!,"This was a fun activity to do inside. You can spend 1 hour or 4 hours. Plan to take LOTS of pictures with your own camera! Some of the wax stars have props you can put on or hold to imitate their position. You can be silly or serious! Lots of stars that you see on tv! Old and new ones! It was a little pricey... $30 and after we spent a few hours there, we stopped in at a Subway and they had buy one get one free to the museum! Wish I had seen that before we went! oh, well!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CindyC1960
50,BEST Wax Museum I've ever been to,I received two free tickets here from Starline tours. It was AMAZING and I would pay money to go back again.The sculptures are realistic and very interactive! They have tons of costumes and props to go on that make it a great time and some great photos!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sahardman
50,Great fun!,"We are a family of four (parents and two teens). We had a great visit to Madame Tussauds. The entrance price was included with a Starline Tours trip, but we would have happily paid the admission fee. We were there mid afternoon on a Monday. It was reasonably busy, but not annoyingly so. It took a few photos to get over feeling a bit silly, but soon we were using the props and striking poses along with everyone else. A really fun way to spend an hour or so.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dianeb454
40,Interesting contrasts,A great way to spend an hour or so. I found it to be a contrast between some excellent real life figures and some no so life like but it was good fun all the same. Ask on the streets for discount tickets before going in and paying full price.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/derekm337
50,Very realistic wax figures!,This was on my daughter's must do list as we didn't go to the one in NYC when we were there 3 years ago. My family had a great time exploring and taking pictures with the figures. It was fun and the figures are so realistic.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CherylH396
50,Enjoyed our visit,We visited as part of our sight seeing tour and wished we had a bit longer. Was very impressed with. We had done the one in DC and was abit disappointed with it but this one made up for it ! Loved the whole vibe of the place. Lots of opportunities to get a photo with your favourite star.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/piperTimaru
40,Fun for all,Heard it was better than others in the area so gave it a go and wasn't disappointed. Was great fun and passed a couple hours. Were able to have fun and take pictures of our own as well as the offer of pictures from them.Gift shop is your usual overpriced things but what do you expect? It's Hollywood baby!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/debbiesE7874GP
50,Four thumbs up for Tussauds,"TOO MUCH FUN! Some of these wax people looked so real I thought for sure they were the real people pretending to be wax. My son and I explored our creative sides posing with famous people, and acting silly. The wax museum has kept up with the past a present greats of entertainment, and has gone to great lengths to provide props and set to enhance your visit. Sound effects also add to the experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/557CarolS557
50,Best by far!!,"During a family holiday to LA, we visited Madame Tussaud's and had a great deal of afternoon fun. 3 stories of the most realistic, life like celebrity wax works to pose next. Have experienced other waxworks which were a sham compared to this one. Even my grandparents loved exploring. Fun for all ages and something out of the ordinary to explore.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K2476QUcarolinem
50,So much fun!,This place was great! You can walk right up to the figures and take pictures! It's three stories of wax fun!!! A must see when in Hollywood!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TXRanney76
40,Great Exhibit!,"Loved it! They have the wax figures set up so you take realistic pics with them. Many of the wax figures are very believable likenesses. We had a blast posing for photos.And don't miss the 10 min 3D Marvel Comics film at the end.P.S.Tourist tip: look for the guys in red t-shirts on the sidewalk, they hand out 50% off coupons!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Clemsun
50,Amazing FUN!,During my recent trip to the Los Angeles area I decided to visit Madame Tussauds Hollywood and I'm so happy I did. There's only one word that describes this place...FUN! I'm not sure how long it normally takes for anyone to tour its three stories of amazing waxworks but for me it took about 2 hours or maybe even longer. After all I did take over 300 photos! If I had to pick a favorite it would've been Tom Hanks as Forrest Gump...absolutely loved sitting next to Forrest on the bench waiting for the bus! Too bad the box of chocolates was only a prop. :-),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pmauldi
30,Its ok,"We have visited this Madame Tussauds before and we only came back because we got free tickets with our HOHO tickets, so we thought why not check out what is new. It is amazing how hit and miss it is, so off the figures are spot on and others are ridiculously off. We had fun taking a few cheeky photos",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/keenastraveller
40,"Fun to do, free with Hollywood Homes tour!",We were given free tickets to Madame Tussauds with the Hollywood homes tour. It only took about 1 hour to get around all the displays. Most are excellent. Fun to take photos with the Wax stars!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MillyMelbourne
50,Way better than I thought,I had low expectations going into this. Most of the figures really look like the celebrities they represent. You are allowed to take photos and touch everything but their faces and hair. Really got some cool pictures. Several floors of figures. I really felt I got my money's worth.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/diane1024
50,Awesome...Must see,"A must see if you are in Hollywood. SO much fun! Visitors can interact with the figures,touch them,wear the props. My 12 year old Grandson had a blast. Getting up close to Will Smith. Pose with Forrest Gump. My Husband getting up close to Jennifer Lopez. We had a blast. What an awesome place to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ingrids498
40,Fun Family Visit,"We went to LA with our 13 year old and she specifically requested a trip here. It was really a fun family experience, and really great for a pop-culture enjoying teenager! We got lots of fun pictures and she did a wax hand there also.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lizmN2648TH
30,Average if you've already been to MTd's before,Had free tickets because I've bought a hop-on-hop-off bus ride. Was okay because I didn't pay for it. But maybe I wasn't impressed because I've visited MTd's in NY and Vienna.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/474nastyam
50,So much fun.,My wife and I had a blast at this museum. You start on the 3rd floor (which is the best) as all the latest Hollwood stars are there from Tyler Swift to Brad and Angie. You get to do poses with them and really ham it up. The second floor is for the earlier era movies stars and the first floor is more sports related. We bought the Hollywood Stars Home tour and this museum was added for free.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pastnajam
40,For the family,"Visited in April 2014. Our group were visiting from Australia on a Dance tour, the girls loved performing here. Posing with all the figures was a good laugh.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EmmaAmies
40,For Movie Buff's,If you love movie and movie starts. This is the place to be.Spread on 3 floor with different cateogories you get enough star to get clicked with.Some of them looks almost real only thing they don't talk.I loved the mockingjay and Julia.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/harishlohar
50,Had a blast taking silly photos! Definitely recommend this!,I visited the Wax museum with my 14 year old daughter and her two friends and had a fantastic time! It was so fun taking silly pictures with all of the wax figures and some were eerily realistic. I felt like Robin Williams was staring right back at me when I stood near him. The service was great and it was a lot of fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/485amyb
40,Glad I've been!,"Went to madame tussauds the day after memorial Monday and it was dead quiet, which was great as it was easy to take photos etc, but actually lacked atmosphere! There were quite a lot of old stars, so it would be nice to have some more modern day stars.Some waxworks better than others, but a good experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Silkysecret
50,Scary how alive they look,"I've never been to any Madame Tussaud's around the world, even when I've passed them, this was my first time. This was amazing! Some of them looked so real i was scared to walk up to them. This is such a good wax museum. Would recommend to my friends!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vkk1994
40,Nice experience,"You get to take selfies or other photos with all these stars, and see what size they really are and touch them. How cool is that?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eerot96
50,So life like!,My brother and I were amazed from the moment we stepped out the elevator door into the first level of this wax museum! So Life Like!! Highly Recommend this - can interact with the figures/touch them/wear the props. SO much fun!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/134caylam
50,The Wax Museum,"Went to Madame Tussauds Hollywood with my family. We were a group of 4 adults and 4 children. Had a wonderful time there. Had pictures taken with all our favourite movie stars. We spent a few hours going around, having fun pretending we were someone special also. Well worth the money, and it has special memories for us all. Jubeni sydney",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jubeesydney
50,Best Pictures Ever!,"We absolutely loved this place. We had the LA Go Card and did four attractions with the card within a two block area. This was our favorite! You start on the 3rd floor and work your way down. Look for props near some of the mannequins then take your photo. Lady Gaga and Jackie Chan are located at the very end behind a wall near the window, its very easy to miss them. Plan on staying at least 1 1/2 hours : )",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robinsU4081OY
40,Wait until night to get a better deal,"This was a fun tour for us. However, I would never pay full price for tickets. We went after 5pm and got tickets online for half the price. The wax figures were fun to see, but the Marvel 4D show was excellent. My entire family enjoyed it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oregonfamilyof6
50,Great fun,"I finally found all of the celebrities I was looking for! This was a fun attraction. It takes a while to get used to the wax figures. They are so lifelike, it's kind of creepy. It was cool to see how small most of these stars really are. The women are all so short and skinny! My whole family really enjoyed it. We took a million pictures. Absolutely do NOT miss the 4D movie at the end. It was the best!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hilohiomom
40,Pretty fun,"I love that you can interact with the wax figures (except their face ) and take all the pics ans poses you'd like. You can use their props they have there too. They are missing some good ones you'd expect and have a couple that you wouldn't think they'd have. It's better to get the free ticket with the starline tours. Also, they offer pics they take which are expensive but you can take really good ones on your own for free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jjnlina
50,Great fun and many figures to see,Whole family enjoyed the museum very much. Many wax figures and we all enjoyed the props to use for pics.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Love2travel-Mtl
20,Once you have seen one you have no reason to return,"Visited this and expected much much more for the price, the attraction needs to be made much more immersive than it is and is the same as every other Madame Tussaud's really - we missed the 4d show as it wasn't clear where it was",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/letsdothis1
50,Charge that camera!!!!!!,Loads of fun!!!!! Well worth the money. Not expensive at all. Great fun taking photos here. One of the highlights of our trip. Saw way more than we expected. Not to miss.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/albertaandharryz
30,Missing a few classics,Good attraction as they always are however some of the staff out the front of the house were quite pressuring and the exhibit itself was missing a few greats!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ligeha
40,They look so real,"We went to Madame Tussauds Hollywood as a family. We enjoy and so amaze how they look so real. Bruce Lee , Marlon Brandon, Beyonce face look so real. And so many artist they look great. The place is not really big. But you will love it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Critic138
50,Great Fun..!,I purchased a 48 hour pass on the hop on hop off bus so we received a free tix here.It wasn't on my to do list but it was soooooo much fun. I went with my 8 & 20 yo and we all enjoyed it equally.I thought we would wizz through it in an hour but you really need to allow at least a couple of hours. There are three floors of famous people and some have props for you to appear in the moment of being with them.The self tour ended with a fun 4D superhero movie.Definitely worth doing if you can get a discounted ticket. Also note that when you are asked to pose four times on entry that you will be sold a photo package on exit..!This would be another tour that I wouldn't pre book as there are people on the street with discounts.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/274sandyh
30,Great for Kids!,"If you've been to any other Madame Tussauds, it's all pretty much the same. The kids like it. It is interesting to see the differences between the different locations...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clearbrook6
40,We had a lot of fun..,"My 11 year old daughter and I visited and we had fun. It is a good 45 min - one hour experience. Pre- purchase your tickets online before visiting. The 4D Marvel experience is only 6 minutes, but very cool. My only complaint is that the line was to long at the end to see the photos we posed for and we couldn't go online to view them. Also I pre purchased a Madame Tussauds book online. It was given to me, but no one told me there were coupons inside for discounts off the gift shop and wax hands (2 for 1). I would have purchased the wax hands if I had known about the coupon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VinoInAGlass
50,"Great Attraction, Truly life-like figures!","Madame Tussauds is easily the most know name as far as wax museums around the world. Hollywood lives up to the name! A large variety of figures, everyone will find someone they recognize and of course be prepared to take lots of photos, this is a very interactive experience (even though they are wax figures)! A fun thing to see & do! I've been to several Madame Tussauds in the U.S. and Hollywood is at the top of my list!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/843staceyf
50,A fun attraction,"We spent a fun couple of hours. It's up to you how much you enjoy this place, be as extrovert as you want to be with photos with your new ""besties"" .At times the models are so life like it can be weird or scary or awesome, depending on who they are!Sitting with George Clooney was awesome and riding ET home was very poignant. Measuring your statue alongside Lady Gaga or Beyonnce is fun and mimicking their poses is a must, whatever you rage may be.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/763lynettew
40,Close enough to be real..,The was statues are impressive with close to real stars.. A well spent afternoon.Probably a little expensive but I believe its wax hollywood within real hollywood so worth the money,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/geet219
50,A must see!,"I was very impressed with the museum, the layout and the incredible waxwork! They are extremely life-like. And there are so many of them! A must see if you are in Hollywood. After this visits I would definitely go to a Madame Tussaud's in another part of the U.S or another country.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/megang989
50,So much fun!,I always wanted to visit one so I made it happen. Very glad that I did and didn't mind paying $38 to visit. I had a blast and felt like a kid again hopping around and enjoy the time I was there. The wax figures were very spot on. The costumes that were supplied to put on helped with the experience. I really enjoyed the experience. Didn't see Rihanna or Will Smith that day but had a great time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Amaru279
40,Fun way to spend a gloomy afternoon,"We came here on a chilly, gloomy day and had a fun time. You are allowed to touch the figures, be interactive and take fun photos.Most of the figures look like a good representation. A few of them make you wonder who they were actually trying to wax!They keep the scenes and figures up to date with current times.We found a coupon online for a good discount. I don't think it's worth paying full price.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lyndarella18
50,Realistic Wax People,"At first I wasn't really interested in going, but the rest of my family really wanted to so I went along. The manager was out front and gave us $10 off because they had a portion of their exhibit that was involved in a water leak. So, we proceeded to the second floor. We were greeted by Selena Gomez and various other musicians. It was impressive. We had a great time taking pictures with each of our favorite celebrities in various scenarios. My kids really got into it. I was glad that we went. My 11 year old son said that was the highlight of his day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H7956FAlisaw
20,"Too expensive, very plain setting","I guess if you have younger kids and want to interact with the figures and take pictures - sure go ahead but try to get in with a coupon. We wanted to see it, not necessarily interact or take lots of pictures but walk thru and enjoy it and the setting. Just wasn't impressed and thought it was way too expensive. Would not go back or recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MikeB915
50,Amazing,"The wax figures were eerily real, only the hands give it away. At some points i got real close to some of the figures and actually felt awkward being that close to someone haha. Its cool that you can put on costumes and get photos with the characters.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Teagzy91
40,Very Cool!,"Visited in early June as this attraction was included in our Go LA Card. The museum is expensive at $30 per person, but there are half price coupons available on the street. The wax statues are incredibly lifelike and the detail is phenomenal. Don't miss the 4-D show just before you exit the museum, it was outstanding.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I5228NQjoyceb
40,Another surprise fun visit,"Sounds a bit silly, but watching the kids take pictures with the 'celebrities' was actually fun. The museum provides props so they can 'dress' to match the theme or character.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NoMoses
40,Pretty Cool Experience!,We took a group of students there a few months ago and everyone absolutely loved it. The museum is well spread our over several rooms and you don't feel crowded in any areas. Some of the characters look so real including Tiger Woods and Jack Nicholson. A great place to spend a few hours with the whole family!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SteveRainville99
50,Awesome,Loved every minute! Almost didn't go in as I had been in others but glad I changed my mind. This one has props and was to interact with the wax statues that the others I had been to didn't. May seem a bit expensive but worth it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/is0bel77
50,fantastic,"Fantastic a must see and do, not that expensive, fantastic displays, great for photo's. Love how you can touch and get your photo with all the wax displays",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/snake43
30,Ok but disappointingly small.,We visited Madame Tussaud's only because we had free entrance tickets as part of a city guided tour offer. It was fun but I was surprised at how small it was.Most of the figures were quite realistic and the 3D movie at the end was good fun.I would have been very disappointed if I'd paid $30 to enter.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cranbourne
50,Great experience,"Was better than I expected. The figures are pretty realistic, maybe a bit creepy.Having props to take pictures with is a great idea.Would definitely recommend!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jtoland89
40,Nice visit but Get the 50% off deal,This is much better than the Hollywood Wax Museum. The figures are way more realistic and you get to interact with them more plus there are more recognizable stars here. If you can get the 50% off deal that would be great. The 3D movie at the end was great too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ayeshaalexis
30,Over priced,"Ok! I have never made it to London, but I thought New York and DC combined were better. So glad we got a discount on the tickets. They take three different pictures of your party after telling you how to view the museum. You cannot touch the hair or face of the sculptures and many look fake. The lay out of this Madame Tussauds was not the best. Yes, I took some pictures, but this will not be the highlight of my vacation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/charlot
50,"Amazing, loved this place!","This museum is amazing, and the wax figures look so real! I saw many of my favorite celebrity figures, and my daughter saw Lourde, and Taylor Swift she was elated. We truly enjoyed our visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shelbtravelin99
40,Fun place for Wacky Photo Ops with your favorite Wax Celeb!,I went here with a group of 8-13 year olds and they seemed to really enjoy all the wax figures. Some are better than others and it's small so it doesn't take that long to go through the place. They have current and older celebrities in various settings. It's fun for pictures and not too bad price wise.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PineappleShagette
50,Fabulous Fakes,Absolutely amazing. And even more fantastic is you are allowed to touch the figures ( except hair and face).You learn how long it takes to make the figures.My adult daughter and I visited and enjoyed it very much.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/836ninaw
40,Different,"I did like this attraction. Most of the statues were really life like, to the point I expected them to turn their heads and say ""Boo"" to me. There were a few that were questionable. Being honest, it wasn't overly spectacular, but I would still go. I was a little disappointed that the souvenir shop didn't really have anything (magnets, key rings or the like) specifically for Madam Tussauds. I would recommend a visit though",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/donnamd2014
40,Great visit,"We had never visited a Madame Tussaud's previously, but we really enjoyed it as a way of passing time while in Hollywood.The location is great and consider getting your hand waxed for a souvenir. (Be careful you don't have any cuts on your hand, I had a tiny cut and it was complete agony - I swapped hands and there was no pain at all)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Scottishcouple16
20,Holywood Madam Tussauds,This presentation verged on downright theft! Having been to the one in London this was definitely a poor relative and definitely not worth the entrance fee of nearly 60 dollars! Save your money and spend it on something better.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Al-Shumba
40,Hanging Out With the Celebs,"I had a fun time at Madame Tussauds. We went mid day on a Saturday and it was a little on the busy side but manageable. Everything looked so realistic and it was great you could get all close and personal with them. The only downer was the price. It was almost $30 to go into the museum. We found out later if you we had ordered online or done a bundle deal we could have gotten in for less. As much fun and unique it was, I think $30 for a at the door price is much.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C4910VZjessicaa
40,Its a Wax Museum,"As long as you don't come here with any great admiration's of seeing anything life changing, its great.There is a good range of music and movie stars from different era's.Thankfully they had a 4D theatre with an Avengers flick on which turned this from a Average to a Very Good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S2298YTpaulh
40,"All Waxing, No Waning","This place is a kick is one of the more famous wax museums. Staff is cordial, the venue is clean and pleasant. This is in kind of a sketchy area so be aware of your surrounding coming to and leaving the venue. Keep an eye on your wallet. Madame Tussauds' is really fun though and is an excellent place to take your tweens. I was here over thirty years ago and still have the photos I took then.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RubenC35
50,First Time Visiting and Will Not Be The Last!!!,"I had heard so much about Madame Tussaud but I had no idea how much fun it would be. The cost was GREAT! the even offered a really good discount for the tickets we purchased online. I was visiting Los Angeles for the first time with my sister for her birthday on 5/21/15. From the moment you come through the door there are celebrity wax figures there to greet you. We were advised that we were welcome to take pics, touch the figures but to not touch the face or hair which was fairly simple rules to go by. The are 3 floors and each room is full of figures and fun props that can be used to take pictures in. I felt like a little kid running around the building snapping pics and oooing ang ahhhing. I highly recommend to make this a must see if in Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lajoycedeshan
40,Great day out,"I loved the wax museum, especially the old Hollywood stars section - it is magical. All models made to scale so that is how tal Marilyn Monroe was, and how slim. You can hold the models for pictures and get properly close, but do not touch faces or hair - they're delicate. This is fun for pictures and gives a real flavour of Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z8168DOhelenc
20,Disappointed here,"I saved going to Madame Tussaud's Hollywood for my last day in LA so that I could leave on a high. What a mistake, I had to wait in a cue go rages before even getting yo buy a ticket, then another line waiting to go in. It wasn't worth the money. Very disappointed with the figure of Vin Diesel, so was another lady. The only good thing about this place was the 4 D show.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lois233
40,Fun place in Hollywood to take a break.,"We visited Madame Tussauds while waiting for our Hollywood Home Tour on a Saturday. It was a fun place to take pictures and for the most part, all the wax figures looked real. (Our 5 year old thought we had a real conversation with Iron Man). Perfect place to get out of the crowds and sun and get some great pictures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/keltib
50,Very realistic,"It was our first trip to LA and we wanted to make sure we got to see some movie stars so we went to the Madame Tusards museum. The wax figures look so realistic and you are allowed to take pictures. I got one with me sitting next to Will Smith and my son asked if I really got to meet him when he looked through my pictures. They have old and new stars and singers. It was well worth the hour or so being indoors on such a hot and sunny day. You can go at your own pace, stay as long as you wish.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/208krisp
50,Rubbing Shoulders with Celebs,Madame Tussauds Hollywood is a great place to take pictures with your favourite wax version celebrity. it was real fun and i enjoyed myself there except for those hustlers in front of the building the experience was awesome.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/samukelis0m
50,great chance to see celebrity people closer,"they all looks real. I assure you spend a great fun time in there. Once u go to LA, visit this museum and u feel like in LA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/happilyeverafter2014
30,Madame Tussauds Hollywood,Great for taking photos and lots of variety of celebrities but not as realistic as the Madame Tussaud's in San Fransisco.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TeganH71
40,Madam Tussauds Hollywood,"Myself, my guy, his Mother, and 2 sisters went to Madam Toussauds on 8/22/2014. I enjoyed the Wax Museum and impressed at how realistic many of Hollywood Stars were. We enjoyed putting hats etc. on while posing for photos.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/749robinr
50,Creepy and yet fun,The wax figures are truly life like and the variety of famous people throughout the last 50 or 60 years is pretty impressive. The area where they explain the process and offer a $15 wax impression of your hand is worth sticking around a few extra minutes to see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wheels3993
50,Awesome!!,This was my first experience with a wax museum and I have heard so many good things. Needless to say I was not disappointed. The prices are pretty up there but there are people all over up and down the walk of fame handing out BOGO coupons for admission. So my fiancé and I got in two for one. It was a really good time and we got a lot of great pictures! Definitely recommend this!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/935chelseaj
40,Great time,Very lifelike and wonderful. Was fewer than I really expected so was not crowded. Definitely take a camera and have fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bountyqlu
40,Fun,Visited here with family was fun. we took some pic with famous character and some of it we took for free. it was fun and not to crowded.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Edwinlk18
40,Fun visit,"If you ever go to Hollywood, this place is a worth visit. Fun to see waxed figures with the real height... Dont take the paid photo... Not worth the price.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/null
40,Surprising,"Visited here as part of a tour group. Having never seen waxed figures before, I was really blown away at the level of detail that went into these figures.It was quite eerie looking into the eyes of Morgan Freeman with him looking directly at you. My 13yr old daughter had a blast taking selfie after selfie. Part of the fun I think was guessing who was who and confirming this against the name plates nearby. Some of the older 'stars' proved challenging.The display was across several floors which seem to flow into the next level.Well worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/739careym
40,"When visit Hollywood, 1 of the places to visit","A must visit place when visiting Hollywood.Difference from Hong Kong is we get to see the Madam Tussauds figure and more information about her works.Initially, our 6 yrs was not really interested in posing with us so we adults just push along the stroller while we pose with the different figures. Approximately 10mins later when we pose & requested again for our kid to join us she got into the mood with us and started the fun of posing.Our 2 years though is not that interested.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tot2Travel
40,Very fun!,"It is a very nice place! We totally enjoyed It! Maybe not as exciting for youger kids, but we certainly think it's a place you should stop by.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I1824AHmariab
50,Fun for Everyone,"Ive visited various wax museums, several by Madame Tussaud. This one is much like the others, but so much fun with the stars in their movie character garb. The availability of props for photo ops was great, too. That alone makes the experience fun and interactive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/653debrab
40,Goofing around with celebs is fun,It's fun to pose with your fave celebrities. I actually enjoyed posing so much that I injured my finger when I did some stunt on the jeep.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MommyWandered
50,Fun!,"Our group really enjoyed visiting Madam Tussauds in Hollywood. The sculptures are amazing, so much detail. Some were very good and looked so much like the actual person. We were encouraged to take photos with the sculptures and props were provided with some. We had a lot of fun in this museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Verkco
40,Like all the others,Its so nice and exiting to visit this museam! Get ready to take a lot of pictures from the moment you step in!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/boojua
40,Wax Hollywood stars,It has an entrance fee and is a 3 floor exhibit and one should start from top to bottom. They have some really good waxed Hollywood stars to click pictures with. Must visit for all who are nearby the Hollywood walk of fame.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GGupta83
50,Fun activity,This was a fun place to spend some time. You can stand/sit right next to the wax statues and even touch them. They are very realistic so looks like you are actually posing with the celebrity! I've been wanting to go to a Madame Tussauds for a while and it was definitely worth it! They also take a bunch of photos with you against a green screen at the start and the end up on all different backgrounds at the end (for an extra cost of course). This was fun but they went through all the different poses so fast and where we couldn't see the background (was on a screen for others to watch but we couldn't see) so some of our photos ended up being quite awkward and unprepared. Not sure why they went so fast as there was no one else waiting. Still fun though!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hailz897
50,Hollywood Screen Legends,This was one of the best Madame Tussauds that I have visited. Loved seeing all the old Hollywood stars. They were all really life like here and I wasn't disappointed at all not like when I went to San Francisco.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kareno311
40,Though in wax but realistic,"Great place to have pics with your favourite celebrities,though the statues are in wax they look so real.there is great shop to buy souvenirs just outside the museum and I was having a sale with any item for 5 $ so bought quite a few things from there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/drrohitvashisht
40,Rubbing Elbows with the (Wax) Stars,"First of all -- walk around the Walk of Fame first, because you are likely to find people giving out coupons for discounts ranging from $5 off to 50% off for your entire family group. We used the one for 50% off on each of our tickets (Without a discount, the admission is $29.95 per person).Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum was a lot of fun because we were able to use props and pose with many of the celebrities. We .iked the fact that there was plenty of room to move in and around the figures and not feel crowded or rushed. We visited with our two teen age grandchildren and everyone (except our 15 yr. old grandson) was up for photo ops. Don't be embarrassed to use the props because it will really get you into ""Star Mode"".",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MimiM785
40,To do to say you've been there,"Went past a few Madame Tussauds around the place but decided the one in Hollywood was the place to go. Fun little trip and you can take some funny photos, dont need long to go through so plan on doing some other things while your down there",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leanne5081
30,a wax figure is a wax figure.,"I have lived in Hollywood my entire life, and when I saw a group-on for Madame Tussauds, I bought it. The group-on deal was a good deal, but I wouldn't have gone if I had to pay the regular admission price. Overpriced,but what do you expect. It is a tourist attraction. My girls and and I enjoyed it. But really no big deal, a wax figure is a wax figure. Went to the other wax figure place once too. This place is a lot bigger and nicer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/losinginla
40,Fun way to spend an evening with teens.....,"We had a blast exploring Madame Tussaud's. Being there on spring break we were surprised the crowds were not bad at all - which might be the advantage of going in the early evening. Most of the wax figures were uncanny in how realistic they were and there is something for everyone, from sports figures to presidents to singers. With Marilyn Monroe, Cleopatra, Charlie Chaplin and Howard Hughes, we even had a bit of a history lesson for our teens (they didn't even know who Marilyn was) and it was fun seeing how small some of these larger than life celebrities are in real life! The teens loved taking pics and there were a lot of props to use. We went to this museum over the Hollywood one based on trip advisor and we were really glad we did. The online savings were great and we purchased via iphone as we arrived - super easy. Overall, much better than we expected!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JayneNC
50,Foto galore,Been to many of tussauds wax museums love them there all kinda simular but theres something about going to the one in Hollywood on hollywood blvd thats makes it special,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luna6373
50,So much fun for the family!,"We had a blast touring Mdme Tussauds. I was completely impressed with how many different characters in various themed rooms there were. There were a fun assortment of random props throughout to dress-up and get fun pics with the figures.There was a real variety that catered to the young ones (J Lo, Lady Gaga, Taylor Swift etc), and some cool throwbacks like Marilyn Monroe, Howard Hughes and Cleopatra.We had a small mix-up ordering the tickets online, but even though this happened, Blair as Head of Operations was super responsive and helped correct the situation. Very classy.Thanks for the great time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Luther_dog
30,Can get a bit crowded,"We visited Madame Tussaud's in March on what appeared to be spring break. Although the crowds weren't unreasonable, they were a bit more than usual in this attraction. The staff (except for the gift shop) were either invisible or just not present. The wax figures were a hit or miss. The Taylor Swift one, for example, was fantastic, while Leonardo DiCaprio looked nothing like himself. We enjoyed taking photos, but crowd control could be much better, and a larger staff presence would be preferable. Worth visiting, especially for younger kids, but go on a weekday to avoid the crowds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RyanTravels24
50,Very Cool,"Very cool experience at the museum. We loved seeing all of the celebrities and were excited that you were able to pose with them and take pictures. The rooms get a little crowded, but the tour is well planned out to keep you moving.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emarcieg
50,A Must Do,What a wonderful place to visit. Kids love getting pictures with the Marvel Superheros and I enjoyed all the different movie eras. It is amazing how life like they are. Great place to visit for the whole family.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Disney4us4
40,Work of art,"Enjoyed taking pictures of superstars, may it be a singer, athletes, movie actors and President Obama. Reminiscing the Classic movies of the 70's while looking at the stars .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yamv
50,Stunning!,Loved seeing all the celebrity in their finest wax form. great attraction and conveniently located in the city. great place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/236sj
50,See the Stars,We loved this one because it was so well focused on Hollywood people. Visitors can takes great pictures and get up close to favourite stars. They even provide some helpful props for great pictures. Must see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/261LBTW
50,Amazing,I went to the US for the first time and I loved it so much all the site seeing and loved every minute of it but madame tussauds was by far the best place to visit Thank you,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Brenden91
40,Realistic Figures - Better Adjust the Exposure on Your Camera!,"OK, I admit I was rather blase about the wax museum when a friend said she wanted to go inside. Then I found myself pausing as the elevator door opened...but I won't spoil the surprise! Suffice to say, it was an enjoyable experience. My only regret is I didn't remember to adjust the exposure on my camera until well into the second floor. There are so many bright light sources focusing on the wax figures that the exposure needs to be reduced on many cameras.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GracieColorado
50,Are you real,Loved that you could touch and take your own pics! They also take pics that you can purchase. Was part of Go Card but you can also get a 2 for 1 deal when you purchase other tours on the boulevard.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melodyt977
50,Awesome-better than expected!,"For weeks leading up to our holiday to the states, I was begging my boyfriend to come with me to the museum. He wasn't keen at all and thought it would be ""lame"". When we arrived today.. He was blown away by how many wax figures there was to see and how much fun we had!The staff were awesomeness especially the girl working as the photographer at President Obamas Office today (17/3/15)!Loved the 4D show they had running too!Boyfriend was surprised, I was happy.. Awesome day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melmmurphy
50,Entertaining and good value,"I didn't expect much , I got a combo tickets with some tours so I gave a try , and it was so much fun , great statues look actually real , lot of awesome and funny pictures, if you an adult and you like cinema , you have to go , and if you have kids they will have so much fun and lot of good memories.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GuillaumeC441
40,Great statues.,I appreciated their job. Each artist was made with a great details. You might prefer to buy the tickets before you got there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brunoo534
40,cheap tickets,If you are planning to visit this....buy your tickets online its more cheaper..its located along hollywood boulevard....we have fun,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/donnar501
50,Entertaining place with great photo opps,You'll see all your favorite celebrities brought to life before your eyes. There are plenty of opportunities for photos. My family had lots of fun taking photos with the wax figures...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PJSacchetta
50,Fun and great photo ops,"I almost changed my mind about going to a wax museum, but, I'm glad I didn't because this place is awesome! The figures were so life - like I had my husband post one on his Facebook page and claim he met a star...and it worked! There were 3 floors and numerous stars. They even had props that made the whole experience more fun. Don't go by yourself, you need someone to hold the camera. Also, if you're planning to go to more than one attraction you may want to look into getting a GoPass like we did. It gave us more bang for our buck.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chyreller
30,"Interactive, but sparse","We visited as part of a package deal, and many of the displays proved to be fun and amusing, but there didn't seem to be as many displays as there are at the London museum.Teens liked posing with Obama and Lady Gaga, and they appreciated the interactive displays.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bonnycate
50,Exciting,What a place !!! We took more than 100 pictures. I don't know how 3hrs passed by. 4D movie was a great fun!!! It was money well spent !!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nomad-prem
20,Sadly Disappointing,This ideally located Mme. Tussaud's wax museum is nothing like its London counterpart. This bottom of the barrel attraction seems very low budget and has very little creativity like the other Mme. Tussaud's museums the figures are excellent but the setting is stark and underwhelming.In other words I would totally skip this on anyone's trip to Los Angeles and head for The streets of Beverly Hills or Ventura Boulevard in Studio City where you're likely to see more stars were not made a wax although they might appear that way.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TRVLtruth
30,It's ok,$29.95 admission fee was a bit much to be honest. It's just ok. I think I was expecting too much having been to Madame Tussauds in London a few years ago.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chris-EF9
30,Not as good as expected..,"Neither my wife nor I had ever been to a madam tussauds before and thought we would give the Hollywood one a go.We were lucky enough to get a voucher for $10 each off full price entry from a guy on the walk of fame which was great since we were going anyway.We weren't really sure what to expect but kept an open mind. Entry with our discount came to just under $40 for both of us. All the staff are really friendly and polite but we were a little disappointed with how sparse the displays were. They we're laid out with so much space between them that there didn't seem to be as many waxworks as we thought there would be.However, on the plus side they are so realistic. I for one was mesmorised with how much detail there was. They were so lifelike that as I stared at the eyes of one I half expected it to blink.There are interactive works as you go round where the staff take pictures for you which you have the option to buy at the end however you are under no obligation and there is no pressure selling.We are glad that we did it but wouldn't rush to visit again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luckstrike13
40,Tons of fun!,Our family had lots of fun posing with the wax figures! Some of them are very life like. I enjoyed seeing Robin williams and Joan rivers since I admired both of them and they recently passed away. There are some props at some of the locations that make pictures turn out great!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rphsweet
50,They look so real in pictures-friends thought we met the stars!,Loved the fact that you could pose with the stars. Also loved that they create a photo op for you to pose with the star from their movie that made then famous.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lorifreeman
50,"Quick, cheap, fun","We got a $5.00 off coupon outside so we decided to go in. We were practically the only ones in there and we had so much fun! The sculptures are really neat, and most of them are identical to their celebrity inspirations. It cost $25.00 with the $5.00 coupon and was so worth it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/courtneyz684
50,Great way to spend a couple hours in Hollywood,"We didn't visit Madame Tussauds last time we were in LA, as we'd heard mixed reviews, but this time we got tickets as part of a tour we had organised. We though 'why not have a look' and I must say it was a great afternoon! The three of us love running around taking pictures with our favorite 'stars'! The lower levels were great as they were interactive (throw on a ""T Birds"" jacket and sit with John Travolta, Sit on the ""ET"" bike, Putt with Tiger Woods, etc.). Great memories and would definitely recommend a visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheScriber
40,Cutw,Not as big as the one in Vegas it seems but it still measures up to the wax figures.It's fun taking photos with the fugues and feeling like you've met the celebrity or have seen themUp close.I would recommend it if you have never been to a wax museum.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/562margaritas
30,Another Madams Tussaud's,I visited Madame Tussaud's on my own and it was alright. Nothing short of just another Madame Tussaud's really.. I purely went to fill in time on the boulevard..I feel to have an amazing time and get the most of getting celeb photos you need to go with a friend...I was however really happy to get a photo with Forrest Gump!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zoes412
40,Fun!,"My daughter loves Madame Tussaud, so we go if there is one close by! Always fun, every museum is specific to the area and this one was well presented. It is included on the Go LA card, making it great value.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeeAdelaide
40,Stars central,A lot of great memories....got our picture taken with Whoopi Goldberg and Will Smith....those figures look real.....couldn't touch but I promise you I expected them to move for sure.....fun family exhibit,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sando93
50,Plenty of giggles,"We had such a giggle walking around Madame Tussauds, We'd never been to one before now. It was great to get up close and personal with the celebrities...my partner started playing the piano with Elton and myself riding with E.T. There was plenty of opportunity to take photos. The venue wasn't very busy which made the experience even better. You could even take a tour of how the wax models were formed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KTKate1983
40,"Fun place, great experience We loved it..","We didn't visit last time we were in LA because we didn't have the kids but this time around having our teenage kids with us we decided to go.Its fantastic, we all had so much fun looking at all the wax statues and the way they were all presented was very well done, the only thing its a bit expensive at nearly $30.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tanandshane
50,It was a fun experience - loved it!,"We debated whether to go or not because we thought the entrance fee was too high for a wax museum ($29.95/pp for adults). I was lucky to find a coupon and we saved $8 each ticket. The experience was superb. They do a well job of separating from movies, current personalities, sports, Hollywood, etc. We spent about 2 hours (more than I had thought). You are encouraged to take pictures with the wax figures and participate in the particular situation. They tell you the only thing not to touch is the face and hair of the figurines. I had a fabulous time and encourage everyone to see it. I must say that some of the figurines looked extremely real to the point of ""freakiness."" Very fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maggiet0813
30,Not as big as NYC,Great replicas of many famous actors and artists. Especially liked Elton John playing the piano! I felt that we went through very quick and for the money it was very expensive.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mnewshan
50,Loved it!,"Right in the heart of Hollywood, so many awesome wax figures from movies, sports and eras gone by.. entire museum is extremely wheelchair accessible with ramps and lifts. Highly recommend",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/181AndrewH
30,Interesting enough but expensive,While I enjoyed this it is pretty much the same as NYC or SF. But if you've never been to any of the others take the time to visit. You can take some interesting pictures with the stars. Winter has better prices than in the summer but it is on the high side for what you get.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chiefly1
40,Pleasantly surprised!!,"OK, when my group of high school students insisted we go to Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum, I was not really interested. But upon exiting the 3rd floor elevator into a Hollywood party filled very extremely lifelike wax figures, my opinion drastically changed. The wax figures are so realistic that you're sometimes expecting them to say, ""Boo!"" and scare you.There's plenty of figures to please every generation from current pop stars to classic movie actors to sports figures to other personalities. The best part is that the figures are located everywhere in the room so you can take photos with them. Props are often provided for you to insert yourself right into the scene.Our group had a great time taking photos with the ""stars."" I was definitely pleasantly surprised.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gallascpa
50,Amazing!,"This is the 1st Madame Tussauds I ever visit so it's amazing! It's so fun! So whenever you are in a city that has a Madame Tussauds branch, you must visit it, at least if you had never been in a Madame Tussauds museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hedddo
50,A must do,"This was a last minute decision to squeeze in as much tourist things in la that we could. We had such blast walking around and seeing who was in each room, having fake conversations just for kicks and then taking photos with our favorite celebs. Bring the kids, they will have a blast.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T5885JAjasond
40,Same thing but still a lot of fun!,"I've been to a Madame Tussauds in NYC, but my husband hadn't ever been before so we decided to go. I wasn't objected to this as I was also looking forward to it. It's definitely very similar, but fun to pose with the celebrities regardless. Great for kids, or just to have some fun for a couple of hours. I really liked the variety of people they had in there, references everyone could understand. Loved also the geek references (Picard, Kirk, Thor, Wolverine...). Made this girl very happy. It's scary how real they seem sometimes!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/U331JWjenniferb
40,Normal Madame Tussaud,We have been to a few Madame Tussaud and nothing must changes but enjoy going though them and seeing what's new. Kids would enjoy this as well,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/771323
40,Good to visit!,I went to there with my two other friends. we enjoyed to take photoes with dolls.I suggest to go there if you visit in Hollywood!you'll enjoy it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rina0902
30,Very entertaining but Pricey,There are many levels to visit different celebrity likenesses from every genre and decade. They do provide accessories to pose with the wax figures for picture taking. It is entertaining but short lived and expensive for what you get.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DiabloDeb
50,Entertaining,I hadn't been to a wax museum in 15 years and it was as good now as it was then the detail is amazing. Even if it is rather cheesy posing with wax models it does fill in a hour. Great for all ages.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/timbX493ZC
30,Not worth the money,"This was my least favorite attraction I visited in LA. It's a very short walk through, the wax figures are impressive, but the display is boring. More for adults, I think children would get bored and start touching things since there's nothing else to do but observe",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/agmilano1
30,Very good!,The price is a little steep but the wax figures are so amazing! A couple of times i thought they were real people! We had amazing time looking around all the familar hollywood stars!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/826emmaf
50,Enjoyable,"Any Madame Tussauds is worth going to because they all have their own celebrities which are appropriate to that city. We enjoyed Madame Tussauds in Sunset Boulevard. Watch out for the characters outside who try to get you to pay for a photo with them. Also, watch out for the wannabee singers who sell their dvd... not saying you shouldn't but just keep walking and say no thanks. We went to Madame Tussauds Hollywood, London and New York and they had a little similarity of celebrities but they were also very different so it was worth going to.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TK20132013
40,"Fun, fun, fun!","The cashier told us it would take about 35 minutes for us to visit, and 2 and hours later we finally made our way out. What a good time! Definitely look for discount tickets, bring your camera and get ready for the shenanigans. You'll have a good time snapping shots of family and friends getting up close and personal with ""celebrity"" figures. Although I think it's about time for an update. You'll love it if you're a movie buff!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeanneC130
40,Cool Marvel section and 3D movie,"We had an enjoyable time here with 3 levels of Cerberus to interact with.You can get up close, post and take lots of photos.Lots of different themes from western, action, classics and musicians.Did it with the go card los Angeles do made it better value for money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LozzaCam
50,Much better than we expected,"We lived in London for 7 years & never visited Madame Tussauds there as we were put off by the queues, So when we bought ticks for a Starline Tour we were surprised that it included free entry to Tussauds in Hollywood (excluding the Marvel 4D show).There were no queues when we visited on New Years Eve so in we went & we weren't disappointed! The figures were so realistic! My wife apologised to Meryl Streep for bumping in to her before she realised it was a waxwork!The highlight for my son was the Marvel 4D show which was free to enter on the day because it was a Holiday! Bonus!!!Definitely worth a visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vmcconville
30,A good introduction,It was about $20 American to see which is okCoz there were 3 floors of charachters but I expected more celebrities. There were a handfulOf modern celebs and the rest were action charachters and old school actors. It was still pretty good and so life like. U can have pictures with them which is good too,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alyssssymarie1990
50,The world famous wax museum,Came here as a part of the GO Los Angeles card. Well worth the visit. Wax figures are well made. Lots of variety and fun figures. Spacing is adequate to allow for a small crowd around each one. I wish there were more sports figures. The museum is clean. We had a ton of fun taking pictures.My kids did the wax hand creation. One tip: buy the guidebook for $5. There is a buy one get one free offer for the wax hand. Otherwise each one costs $12. The process takes a while so we waited in line for about 40 minutes for three people to go.I would visit again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/delaware-veg
40,"Your chance to get close to the ""Stars""","Madame Tussauds have a very generous rule - don't touch the faces or the hair, but otherwise, go for it!This is your chance to cuddle up to Taylor Swift, or Morgan Freeman, or One Direction. The displays were interesting, with bits of trivia explaining something of the celeb or movie they were in.There were three floors of displays, grouped by movie genre and era. Admittedly, some of the models were more realistic than others.The exhibition ended with the Marvel Superheroes 4D experience. Warning, prepare to water squirted on you.Tip: buy your tickets online for the best savings. Otherwise, pickup a discount voucher from any of several promoters on the street outside TCL theater.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KJules123
30,My expectation was higher,I liked it. But can't give all star coz... It's comparatively smaller and could be more attractive. Amsterdam one is really great and have many attraction.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tanvir1748
50,Great Fun!,Brought star-loving daughter to the museum. She and husband totally hammed it up. Had a fabulous time. They even had props!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/29charliee
40,Star Sightings,"Fun to be in Hollywood and hang out with movie stars even if they are wax. Great place with lots of space and fun photo ops. If you are going to multiple tourist sites, look into the Go Pass or City Pass.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TiffanyH447
40,Worth a visit,"This is right on Hollywood Blvd, and the wax figures are mostly real looking. It was quite entertaining and I think a good entertainment value.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LisaE3
50,Loved the figures,"The waxed figures were so real especially Forrest Gump and Snoop Dog. It was worth every penny, plenty photo ops. Highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sammied3000
50,excellent museum,"Mme Tussaud's wax museum is a must see. I have seen the one in Niagara Falls in Ontario Canada in the early 80's, that is why we went to see this one. The wax figures are so lifelike it's unbelievable. You can take pictures with them and use the props that are available. You can put your arms around them hold them, the only thing they ask is not to touch the faces. A the end if you want there is a 4D (yes 4D not 3Dmovie) which last only a few minutes. Do go it's worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/detteLasalle
30,Good attraction,"I enjoyed the Madame Tussaud's in Hollywood and would recommend it to people visiting Hollywood, but didn't feel it was as good as the London one.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JPandJEP
50,Get to see the famous,"This was one place we couldn't miss during our LA trip. The wax figures are life like and are awesome. Family loved it. We were done in an hour or so, but you could easily spend 2-3 hours. We went very early to the museum - as soon as it opened. And so the there wasn't any crowd. Which meant we had lots of time to take photographs with the wax figures. And being early there also meant, no lines for photographs with the figures. There's a 4D movie, which was also really good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trexj
50,So lifelike...,My husband and I took our 2 youngest sons to the wax museum. We all loved it. You can get up and personal with all the figures just not allowed to touch them from the neck up. Took great pictures and got a lot of great memories. We even got to see a 4D Marvel cartoon. It was very cool. Only thing I would recommend is definitely buy your tickets online ahead of time. You save almost $10 a ticket. :),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/faith6997
50,Favourite,Madame Tussauds was a must for me in my trip and it was really awesome. There is no need to explain who are there but a wonderful way to share pics with stars . The best of the wax museums. Brad Pitt was my fav .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nithi25
50,Walk with the Rich and Famous,Great exhibit of stars of today and yesteryear. Marilyn stunning as always and Daniel Craig handsome as ever.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SuzanneN65
40,Take BFF pictures with you favorite stars!,"I've been to a few wax museums before but this one was the best by far! They actually let you touch and take pictures with the figures, they just ask that you don't touch their faces or hair. I was amazed at some of the likenesses ... some where spot on and looked so real, there were a few that weren't that great but overall, we had SO MUCH FUN!The museum is three stories and they have everyone from modern day stars like Lady Gaga, Taylor Swift, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts and for a limited time, the band One Direction. They also have the old Hollywood stars from Gone With The Wind, Audry Hepburn, John Wayne and even some super hero's like Captain America and Iron Man.Because they let you get up close and personal with the figures, it means TONS of photo opportunities and a lot of fun (and funny) moments! They have chairs for you to sit on, props for you to use and so much more.My suggestion ... GO!Tip: If you are planning to visit the LA, Hollywood and San Diego area check into the ""Go LA Pass."" You pay a one time fee for the pass and you can use it on tons of attractions, museums, tours, etc. We paid $100 for the pass and in two days as much as we used it we would have paid $290 for the things we did. You can enter into the attraction of your choice once a day (but can go again the next day if you want) and you need to get your admission ticket by 5:30 but can stay until the attraction closes. Saved us a LOT of money!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/THE-TW0-BEES
50,Super sensational fun but parking is a problem,Every display is fun and good picture shots opportunity.Have talked of going for year as felt no interest in such deadies- surprise it was actually fun and funny. Staff were a patient team and keen to give explanations and helpful advice.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/prensyst
40,Worth a visit,"Enjoyed our visit. Great way to get some awesome pics with celebrities! We took heaps of photos and ended up buying the $40 memorabilia photo pack to and it was worth it.Staff we really nice aswell. We went after 8pm and the place wasn't that busy, made it a lot easy to take pics. :) the wax figures are so life like. The best for me was president Obama and Marilyn Monroe was a bit disappointed with George Clooney. A good way to spend an hour or two, worth a visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Thalaris
50,take heaps of photos,great for young and old. good way to get up close and personal with famous people. try go as close to closing time as you can because the place will be empty.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tangawang
50,Great time! Worth the $ & time,Awesome time with the kids. So cool to pose with so many famous lifelike people. A lot more fun then I thought it would be. $98 for two Adults and two teenagers with the coupon is so worth it!!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/978miamid
40,This Place is the Bomb!,I really enjoyed our time in Hollywood's Madame Tussauds. I love how they have three floors full of what seem to look just like about 300 celebrities. Much fun!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M8873BFstephaniec
40,A slice of Hollywood,"I had heard so much about Madam Tussauds from so many friends who had visited various centres across the globe. They had been full of praises, especially for the one in London.This one though was very small, but we were not disappointed. All my favourite stars were there... We were welcomed by George Clooney, I said hello to Meryl Streep, Pierce Brosnan and Daniel Craig. I missed Tom Cruise though.Visit to LA is not complete without paying your respects here... after all Hollywood Boulevard is THE place to go. :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ZoobieSidhu
50,What an attraction to ge immersed in a dream,"I've been to Madame Tussaud’s Museum in Amsterdam more than 30 years ago. I still had a very clear idea of it. Just a few years ago I had to choose between and other Museum in Sydney, AU, and I decide for the Maritime Museum As I already knew the wax museum. I am not so sure I did the right choice. There is no comparison when you are back in the scene. Madame Tussaud’s in Hollywood has plenty of new figures, most of them I have seen acting on movies and they are spectacular. They all look like o be alive and none should miss this attraction. I would go again and again every time I have the chance to visit one anywhere in the world.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Joneca
40,Fun way to spend a couple of hours,"A group of friends went to Madame Tussauds for a birthday outing in Hollywood. The museum is located in the perfect spot. The Roosevelt Hotel and Jimmy Kimmel across the street, next to so many attractions, you can make an entire day of it. If you are driving, park at the Hollywood and Highland and get your ticket validated at the Visitor's Center near the Dolby Theater.Back to the museum. They have done a beautiful job with the wax figures and each room. It is amazing how much time is put into each figure. It is worth the price of the ticket (show your AAA card for a 25% discount) and enjoy a couple of hours at the wax museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shannenavila
40,Remember to purchase online!,"Since we were travelling to New York, Vegas and Los Angeles, we thought we will wait till we reach LA to visit Madame Tussauds. If you are driving, it is cheaper to park at the Hollywood & Highland as it is $2 parking for up to 2 hours with validation from participating shops, restaurants and nightclubs! I think we expected what we going to expect although a lil surprises here and there from the Marvel Characters. Unfortunately, when we got to MT, there were several international tour groups, hence, we were quite annoyed at how rowdy, rude and pushy people are. So we end up taking quick photos and breezing through the crowd. Not a fun way to visit I must say! Definitely, take the chance to visit the Madame Tussauds Hollywood! You can even make a wax figure out of your hands too!PS: Buy your tickets online before you go! Definitely cheaper than you buy it at the door. We bought it 10 minutes on our smart phone before we head in. =)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Anathyst
40,Better than expected,We received free tickets to go here through Starline tours. And it was actually quite fun seeing all the wax celebrities. Most looked very realistic. It was a fun way to spend an hour.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Annafjordan
50,Mind-blowing!,"I was blown-away by how realistic the wax statues are, and I particularly liked the fact that we're allowed to take pictures during the visit. It's almost like the celebrities were there with us. Along the way, as we were walking thru the museum, there were pictures of celebrities with their wax statue. There are also sections of the museum where there's more interactive things, which is also fun. I don't remember where in the museum, but there's a wax figure where you see the different layers and there's explanations on how they make them. It's a fun activity that I recommend everyone to do, if it's something of interest to them.P.S.: It says that I've visited Madame Tussauds Hollywood in December 2013, but I've actually been there in the summer of 2010. I didn't have the option to choose a date going that far back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AGravelle
40,Great place to visit!,"I love Madame Tussaud's in NYC so of course while in Hollywood I had to stop here and check this one out. This place did not disappoint. The figures are mostly all lifelike (was disappointed with the Audrey Hepburn, def. did not look like her!) My favorite was the Marilyn Monroe as it looked the most real, like she was literally right there. The staff was friendly and courteous. This location does not seem as big as the one in NYC but it is still worth a visit. It is clean, very well maintained and a great place if you are a movie buff, past or present.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BubbaSmiley
40,Fun for Angelenos,"The $55-million attraction in a prime location next to Chinese Theatre was open in 2009. Madame Tussauds is named for the famed French wax artiste who made busts for a show that traveled through Europe in the late 1700s and early 1800s.We went one Sunday night. The museum was nearly empty. We really had it all to ourselves.And the fun began. It felt like we were in a private audience with celebrities in a very playful, interactive mode. Just bring your camera and a great mood and you’ll have an unforgettable night. Some characters look scarily realistic, but others not as much. Get up close and personal with celebrities. Taking photographs is encouraged and there are many props available. It’s a great place to spend an hour or two, to entertain your kids or visitors, to appreciate wax figures (at a cost of approximately $300,000 each) and play. And if you live in one of the cities where Madam Tussauds is present, you’re a happy camper!They say travel like a local. I’d say — have fun like a tourist! You’ll be surprised at what you can find in your back yard for $25.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tatianng
50,Afternoon of fun!,"My husband and I went for a few hours and at first he wasn't into it, but as we went along and he saw sports stars and some of his favorite movie stars he began getting into it. We had lots of fun putting on the props and getting photos. The cost is around $30 per person and takes 1-2 hours to walk through. Had a blast!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Julie325
40,Loved it!,I didn't really want to visit this place when we came to LA but my family wanted to see the wax works. I was quite surprised in how realistic and well presented they were! Snopp Dogg was my favourite. Loved it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fionah308
40,An afternoon of fun,"Our travel partner wanted to go in, we obliged her and ended up having a fun-filled afternoon. The wax figures were so life-like and the imagery of various movie scenes added to the realism. We'll probably never meet any of these 'stars' in real life but at least we've posed with them. Dustin & Steve at the photo check-out will always remember their 'Bahama Mamas'. Their friendliness and professionalism added to our enjoyment of this attraction.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dwandererfiles
20,Big let down!,"Been to Madame Tussauds in London, this one doesn't even come close, the wax works just look like they have been plonked about in the different rooms, went as part of the LA Go Card, wouldn't,' go again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoeL247
50,Very impressive,"Went with the family and it was very fun. The figures were very realistic and there were many celebrities to see. A little pricey, but that's to be expected in Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Orangebananas
50,A day at Madame Tussauds Hollywood,"I purchased a Groupon for entrance for two, two wax hands and a guide booklet for $37. which was a super deal since the wax hands alone are $12 each + $2 per color. I have been to the London and Amsterdam Madame Tussauds and this one was so much fun!! You can get up close and touch the wax figures, but not the face, and even use some props to enhance your own photo with the wax figures. There are a lot of figures to see and some are really good. I like the fact that you can actually see how tall they are compared to your own actual height. I live in Los Angeles and love tourist things and this was worth going to and a lot of fun. You can spend as much time as you want inside and we were there a little over 2 hours. Don't miss the free 3 D movie at the end. It was better than the movies you pay for a the theater.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kristaw278
50,Awesome fun,"This actually wasn't on my list, but as we got free tickets with our hop on/hop off tour we thought why not. I'm so glad we did in the end! It's very interactive, it's like you're part of the set, complete with props/costumes. My sis and I had a blast dressing up and posing in our fave movies. We got the best pics from this and people actually didn't groan when we forced them to sit through the obligatory I-just-got-back-from-holiday-slideshowTravelled October 2013",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Novs86
50,Great Photo Ops,"Love to pose for silly pics so this was the place for me! On my 1st trip to Hollywood went to the other wax museum down the street thinking it was this place, big mistake! You can't even pose with the figures! At Madames you're even given props. Took the 11 y/o kiddo & we had a blast taking tons of pics. :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GriseldaC375
50,enjoyable visit,"We recently visited Madame Tussauds Hollywood and luckily we were the first 2 visitors for the day. we really had plenty of room to take photos with not too many others around. The wax figurines were excellent, it was fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/908susie67
40,An Interesting Place,"Amazing wax figures that you can touch, take photos with. They also show the making process and have a short 4D movie at the end. Slightly overpriced in my opinion but still worth a visit especially if you have younger teenagers with you",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/750ralphb
50,Very cool experience!,This was included in the price of our star tour homes so we did it whilst waiting for our tour time. This is just the coolest place! So many stars under one roof and plenty of photo opportunities! Much much better than the London one I'm afraid to say. Go see it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/xuxaf
40,So many pictures!,"Of all the cities to visit a Madame Tussauds I wanted to visit the one in LA, thinging that they would have a great selection of stars. I wasn't disappointed! Really great that you can get so close to the wax figures and the ""props"" they provide to add to the experience are brilliant. Had a really fun couple of hours in here and got so many great pictures. The work that goes into creating them is amazing, incredibly lifelike. Going eye to eye with Hanibal Lecter was quite an experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SassyofLeeds
40,Very good,amazingly lifelike models made this a real fun couple of hours closely situated to all the action of the Hollywood strip. Plenty of models for visitors of all ages.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/525shanec
50,Super fun for everyone!,So much fun! We went after five and got a discount on our tickets. We had a great time taking photos and being goofy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Leighannhe
30,Second honeymoon,Excellent wotk of art all these celebrities scattered around you!Ask for the special effect show and wait for it its at 3 pm usually. Worth feeling a 4d 10 minutes show.My wife was extremely happy taking those pictures with all her best acters and actresses!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ziadj_13
40,Nice and fun,"The kids realy enjoyed the experience an d me too, they had a realy good figures wax it worth visited",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aigonzaq
40,Enjoyable and fun!!,Came here during our stay in California and had a great time looking at the celebs and taking some fun photos with them.Easy to find on Hollywood Blvd and would highly recommend a visit here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JOANNE_M186460
50,Meet the (wax) celebs,"This Tussauds is only about the celebs of these days, but what you'd expect in Hollywood? There plenty of was figures and 95% of them look exactly like the real person! Because it is very thin chance you will meet any if them in life this is your oppurtunity to have a shared photo! The entry fee is a but high but with the GO LA CARD it is in the price (with many other things).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bgama87
40,Didn't Think It Would Be This Much Fun,"I went in thinking it was going to be boring, and was pleasantly surprised. They let you touch the wax figures from the shoulders down and put on some props to take photos. It was really enjoyable and the teen agers loved it. *TIP- there are guys with discount coupons just down the street past the Chinese Theater. Get one before going in to buy your ticket to save up to $10 per ticket!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DothanEvents
50,Very enjoyable experience - awesome fun,"There are lots of wax figures you can pose with, and make sure you bring your camera. It gets crowded with some of the figures so try to be patient. There is a large variety of figures so nobody will be disappointed. A big call on this too - I enjoyed Hollywood slightly better than New York. I felt the figures were better.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chris_sharry
40,Doesn't disappoint,"Madame Tussauds is always a lot of fun. The kids loved having photos taken with their favourite characters such as Selena Gomez, Lady Gaga, Captain America etc. We were impressed with some of the older actors as well: Clint Eastwood was brilliant, as was Paul Newman, Marlon Brando and Steve McQueen.Highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cladel20
50,Great Fun,"pretty awesome experience, the wax people were very life like that it was pretty crazy to see,very fun time walking around taking all the pictures and it is very interactive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vampslayer01
40,Low expectations and pleasantly surprised! Really had a great time,"We were here for a work event. Really great fun. Dj performed, rooftop party, food was just ok. Bar was good. They let you get up close to figures and pose with them. Had a great time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Astoria1239
40,Great fun,"We spent the afternoon having some great fun with all the different wax works. Lots of opportunities to get some great photos with them and ""be in the scene"" with them with different props throughout. We hadn't been to a Madame Tussauds before, but thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. Worth a visit if you have time to kill.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Moogabee
40,A little expensive but still fun!,"We bought our tickets ahead of time online and saved $8 per ticket, so the price wasn't that horrible. The celebrities are extremely lifelike and I only thought a couple didn't look quite right (Justin Timberlake especially). It was interesting to see how tall/short they actually are, since we only see them on TV its weird to see their ""actual size"" for lack of better words. The artistry and attention to detail is very impressive. The museum is laid out really well and easy to navigate. There are employees throughout trying to take your picture with the celebrities and props. We never felt pressured to partake or purchase anything. This would be alot of fun for kids also!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrsSchlosser
50,Really interactive and fun!,I have been to a Madame Tussauds before (not in LA) and I don't remember it ever being as interactive and fun as this. There were props that we could use to enhance our photographic atmosphere with the wax people. Highly recommend to others.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/awesomeast
50,Great value for your money,"Madame Tussaud's is awesome, you get to see all the wax figures who look very realistic. Worth the price and is in the heart of Hollywood. My 4 year old daughter was not afraid and loved posing next to the celebrities.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adriannae2013
40,A must visit!,This museum is in the heart if hollywood blvd near chinese theater. Some of the figures are a little sketchy but overall it's a great experience wandering around. You can take a lot of photographs with the figures and there's stuff around like hats and scarves which you can use to add a little creative flavor to your photos.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RaihanehA
50,Good fun,We went in as we had admission included with our GO Los Angeles Pass. It was worth it! I loves the Grease & Patrick Swayze parts the most!! Was worth the visit and the free Avengers 4D movie was good :),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shanric
40,Great attraction,"We were already planning to visit but while walking around Hollywood Blvd we were given a discount voucher (40 or 50%) so definitely worth trying to get one of those before going. There was quite a few statues to see, with Samuel Jackson being my favourite! There were professional photo opportunities throughout the attraction, with them starting at around $30 to purchase at the end. The giftware shop was well stocked.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Perimegs
40,A good laugh,"My friend and I brought our Universal Studios tickets from here and got a free entry each to Madame Tussauds. It was very cool to wander round and take photos, we had a great time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HayleyNZ87
50,Loads of fun and photos,You get to really be a part of the picture. You can't touch the face or hair but you can touch the wax figures which make for great photos. They also have lots of props to make you really part of the picture. We were there when it was super hot so it was also nice to escape the heat. Really glad we went.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suzettek199
50,So much fun!,"They have all the ""current celebrities"" in there... and you can take pictures with them (not touching the face, the hands or the hair, of course)! They have some interactive stuff, too. You can also wear some gear avaliable to have a more complete experience in there.I had such a great time in this place! The pictures that we took with Obama are so funny......If you're visiting several places in LA, I'd suggest buying the Go Card LA (on smartdestinations website), and get reduced prices on each attraction. If you don't like the ""packages"" they sell, you can customize one. It's a great deal! :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aandressa25
50,Great fun,We initially only went because we got a free ticket with our sightseeing bus tour but glad we went it was great fun.We went in the evening time at about 6.30 so it wasnt busy there was no queue to get in or take photos with wax works. Some of them are so life like its scary..we got some great photos. The 4d marvel show at the end was really cool. Took us about an hour in total it was well worth it,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BUSHMCLOVIN
40,What is going on inside Johnny Grant's mouth??,"Is that supposed to be his tongue, a wad of pink bubblegum, or what??Lisa, the spying monitor from MT, you go take a peek at it -- and then report back to me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/852katherinez
50,Great Fun,"To some people , the idea of walking round a waxworks display sounds pretty boring. However , this is Hollywood so Madame Tussauds is a little different.The majority of the displays are all famous movie stars. You can get up close and personal with the displays and they encourage photography with the models. Its great having a picture taken with John Wayne or Cameron Diaz.You can even have your picture taken in the Oval office with President Obama in attendance. The models are so life like for the most part, your friends will be hard pushed to see the people in the picture with you are not the real thing. Great way to spent an hour when in Hollywood. Highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LJB610
50,Great!,Great little venue and full of interactive props. I would recommend! Only took just over an hour. The marvel section was great!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShelleyOC88
30,Not much to see,"Madame Tussauds in Hollywood is a very small version of what we have in London. It has very less stars.Ambience is also not upto the mark.Being in Hollywood, it should have been better.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deepakbansal2000
50,Meet the stars,"We went along as a bit of interest, but couldn't believe how excited the teenage kids were upon seeing the wax models. They couldn't wait to get around the next corner and see who was coming up next. Well worth the couple of hours in the heart of Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chrisdY6254YU
50,Audrey and Marilyn,"I really only went to see Marilyn and Audrey, but there are some other really cool statues at this location as well. #ClassicHollywoodThe Audrey statue has her sitting at a table that you can sit next to her and take a pic. #ReallyAwesomeMarilyn's statue inside the museum is fun too!TIP: The statue of her in the white dress putting her hand prints in the concrete is either at the door of the museum, being cleaned out of view OR it is somewhere down the Hollywood strip. You kinda have to hunt for it, but it's TOTALLY worth it MM fans! When I went I thought I wouldn't get to see it, but they put it back out at the door of the museum right before we were about to leave. Fabulous piece and perfect photo op that EVERY MM fan shouldn't be without.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Revy679
30,Once is enough,Some of the wax figures were amazing to see but some of my favorite character likenesses did not even look like the real person. I was somewhat disappointed after hearing all the hype. I doubt I'll ever pay the money to go here again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cmserene
50,I got to hug Beyonce!!,This place was great!! I got to hug Beyonce :PSome of the characters are almost eerily real looking. I am impressed!! It was a very fun time!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/purplemustreign
30,Pictures with stars.,"My teenager daughter really wanted to see this museum as she had never seen one like it. She had an amazing time playing with props and taking pictures with stars. Some are very look alike; others are not so great.The set-up for some is great and you can play with it. The ones that I preferred was Patrick Swayze and Will Smith! My daughters loved Lady Gaga and Justin Bieber.We all liked the movie scenes.Fun, but not different that other wax museums.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zaz936
30,Worth a look,"I picked up a decent deal on travelzoo so I took the family along. I wasn't sure if it would interest the kids (12, 9, 4) and although they didn't know many of the actual actors they were looking at, they still enjoyed posing with them. It took a good 1.5 hours to get through and I would of happily taken longer but miss 4 was getting rowdy. As part of the deal it included a wax mould of your hand which I actually thought looked a little creepy. Only one of us wanted to get this done thank god as there was one guy serving and doing the moulds and we waited a good 45 min to get this done. I think this is a dodgy gimmick but each to their own. Consider whether your children will want to do this as the wax is quite hot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wadeandnat
50,Good fun,Wow had a great time and they look so realistic! Loved every moment of it. Taking photos with stars was such a fun time!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/loganm618
50,Great Tourist attraction,"This was a great stop for us after doing the TMZ bus tour. It gave us a chance to see celebrities we didn't get to see on the tour. Some are very good replications and others just look weird. I would recommend this attraction, but use the $5 off coupon which you can usually get from your hotel.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shkinia
40,the predictable collection of waxworks,"As this is Hollywood expect excellent waxworks of celebrities from the entertainment worldThere are a handful of sporting celebrities, and President Obama but otherwise expect to see the usual parade of A-listerspersonally, I prefer some variety (Tussauds New York is better imo because of this) but due to the location you really can't expect any different. As usual, the waxworks are extremely good, and there are quite a fair few of themnot a bad Tussauds museum",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/the_fatdonut
50,Visit recommended,"Last time we visited a Madame Tussauds was in London over 10 years ago. This proved to be an eye opener and a reminder as to how good they are. It's always surprising to see what your favorite actors look like in (almost!) real life, whether shorter or taller than you thought and so on. The nice thing here of course was the close link with Hollywood. My favorite? The Captains Chair of course! who could miss out on such a Star Trek Occasion! Highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nazaire
40,Had a surprisingly good time,"I was not one who was gung ho to visit a wax museum, find them a little on the creepy side honestly, but now having been to this one, it was a lot of fun. Went because it was on my brother's to do list and while the admission price is a little steep it was a fun time. There were only a few sculptures that look a bit past their prime and my brother was disappointed that Britney Spears had been retired, but some of them were amazing. I particularly loved the old Hollywood section of the museum. Gloria Swanson looked fantastic. Great addition to a Hollywood trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jennifers587
50,Better than I expected!,"I'm not into the mainstream media, I don't follow celebs nor do I watch TV to keep up with whatever is out there. So I'm not exactly a typical Madame Tussaud's fan. I happen that I had some guests from out of town and they wanted to visit the museum. I joined them out of curtesy and I ended up having fun. We took lots of pictures, goofed around, felt like a kid again.Then the 4D presentation at the end gave me a headache. I'm not used to 3D/4D and this one was just all violence. The kids around had blast though which makes me wonder how why the entertainment industry for kids nowadays are focusing on violence so much?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lored889
40,Its pretty neat,"I had already been to the one in Vegas before going to this one but So i wasnt shocked by how ""real"" they look. However i did think they had some cute interactive photo ops. The how it was made section was great i like to see what goes into making one. There is a gift shop with candy and souvenir pictures you can purchase. Its right in the heart of Hollywood so its not far from other attractions. You can get a package if you plan on doing the Hollywood wax museum and Ripleys as well, its cheaper that way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bward27
40,Surprisingly fun!,"We decided to go local during the Labor Day weekend so Hollywood was the 1st choice. We took the Metro so parking and traffic was not an issue. We are Merlin/Legoland Annual Passholders so admission to the attraction was free! Yay!!! We had so much fun! The wax personalities look so real (sometimes feel creepy!) - the eyes, teeth, hair and even the veins on their hands!!! Wow! We had fun taking pictures and posing with the stars!!! Lol! Even my 5yr old who has no idea who these people are had fun especially when we came to the wolverine/iron man/Thor/captain America area. The only downside is the area is a bit small and so it tends to be crowded. And there were not so many ""stars""... Wish they would add more! Would go back? Of course!!! So I could take more pictures!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/13rinag
50,Lots of fun!,"This attraction was a lot of fun. Most of the wax statues looked very realistic and they were spaced out well so that it was easy to navigate around them, even with the crowds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LuvHaleiwa
40,Interesting,My husband and I really liked the wax figures and especially the section on how the figures are made.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annexplorer71
30,An hour or so of mild entertainment,"My wife and I have lived in the Los Angeles area all our lives and so this was a trip to see a local site. The museum is in the center of Hollywood and so it’s crowded and parking is a bit of a pain. I’d agree with the recommendation to use the Hollywood and Highland Center parking and get the ticket validated at one of the stores for $2 for the first 2 hours which was more than enough time for us to see the museum. I’d definitely recommend bringing a camera because posing with the models and then posting them on social media will probably be the most fun. We spent a lot of time discussing how much the models didn’t look like some of the stars :-) The models were almost all movie and music stars (a few from sports and the president). I think it could have benefited from a little more diversity like famous people in history: authors, scientists or philosophers etc. It is quite expensive and even though we got 40% off discount tickets through my work I still felt it was kind of expensive. To me it’s a novelty venue, we enjoyed going and had fun especially because it was so different. We picked Madame Tussauds because it had much better ratings however now I’m a little curious to check out Hollywood Wax Museum just to see the difference.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/_MTJ_99
40,Fun attraction,"They let you touch the exhibits and take fun photos! Coupons are available, something we found out about after we paid full price!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/garymlOtt
50,Good fun,"We got free entry here with our hop on hop off two day ticket which was a pleasant surprise.It was lots of fun to take pictures with the celebrity's and of course Obama! Even better that we didn't pay to to, was a nice way to end our day exploring Los Angeles!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sunshine_r92
40,Exciting,I had to run a quick tour since i had to catch a shuttle. But it was nice to see all the was figures of the celebritites. they need to include some bollywood too :),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/740naziaq
20,Would be good if interested in celebrities,"Full disclosure, the only reason we went here was because it came with our Starline tours ticket, and we wanted to cool off in the AC. I have never understood the popularity of Madame Tussaud’s, as it is ultimately just (very well done) models of various celebrities. It was good for getting out of the heat and passing some time, but not something I’d be rushing to do again anytime soon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TNEG
50,Awesome!,It is in good location; next to Chinese Theater. The figures are amazing and we enjoyed the 3D experience too!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aikaterinis2014
50,Fun way to have photos with the stars!,"A great interactive experience from start to finish. You can get as close as you want,pose for photos and even touch your favourite celebrities!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/buckleyfamo
40,"So fun, well structured, and great","Had such a great time. Larger than we anticipated. The figures are so realistic ~ it was great. Don't miss the movie at the end with special effects... Awesome. Even when it was busy, you still have plenty of room to explore comfortably. Staff was friendly. Gift shop very over priced ~ skip it. This was a blast and we will do it again! If you want to wallk Hollywood Bld ~ we parked here, walked the strip, and ended with the museum.. made it very convenient but valet takes forever to pull up your car so bring some patience. NOTE: Look for the ""vendors"" on the street from the venue ~ lots of times they have half off admission coupons. Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Always_Traveling7644
40,Funky but....,I had high expectations. Felt a little deceived with the limited sports figures. Some characters were well presented but others were mediocre. But it is a fun experience in general.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wh0208674
50,"Check out the 4D movie and take up close and personal pics with Hollywoods biggest ""stars""","I had never been to a wax museum before. I did not realize how up close and person you could get with the displays. We had a great time posing with the ""stars"". We also got to be one of the first people to check out their new 4D movie. It was really great and definitely a great stop on our tour of LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/V7978GLmichelleg
40,Nice walking tour,"The museum is on 2 floors, it have all the main characters you know, but definitely it is not the biggest Madame Tussaude. The London one is much bigger",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dookilooki
30,Quite boring,"My family and I were looking forward to this trip to Madame Tussaud's. When we arrived the staff were very friendly.The staff explained where to go and were very excited so that made us feel more excited.We started our journey and it was great. And as we went around we were waiting for the WOW factor and we got it when we had our photograph taken with the President. Then after that it was Ok as the statues were only few and far between.When we reached the end and asked to purchase a photograph we didn't get one as we didn't feel there were any there we wanted. The man serving us said ""Fine"" and then stared speaking over us to the next customer. My son wanted to purchase a photograph with his money but the staff member was very quickly not interested so my son was left very upset and didn't get a photograph.The experience was Ok and I was quite deflated when we came out after the staff member at the end who was very ignorant. I don't think it's worth the money you pay for entry as your only there for about 30 minutes. The staff in the store at the end could certainly do with a crash course in manners and customer service.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SSNelly
30,Fun... but a headache,"We had a coupon to see this place while we were in the LA area, so we figured we would venture into Hollywood and see this place. There wan't a huge line, but the short wait wasn't fun. People around with mega phones telling people about $5 souvenirs, etc. Kind of annoying. Once we were in, I thought it was kinda cool. Some of the wax statues were super realistic and was fun to see them. Others were cool but not as realistic as the others. But hey, they are wax, I'm not expecting perfection. The place is super crowded and everyone wants pics with their favorite stars, so if you want in, you gotta push in. The lighting isn't great for point and shoot cameras or camera phones, so sometimes you'd have to take a few pictures, but still not great. I thought that most of it was cool, it was just a headache to go through. At the end was a little thing about how they are made, which I thought was interesting. But making your own wax hand didn't interest me at all, especially by the end, I was ready to leave.For me, this is also a one-time stop, I don't think I'd visit again. Once you've seen it... you're good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kdub_lewis
50,A fun afternoon for the whole family!,"We had lots of fun posing with the wax movie stars and taking Pix! They are very realistic looking. Glad we stopped in, after strolling up/down Hollywood Blvd. Look for coupons, otherwise it can be pricey. Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eschlack7
40,Great quality,We had a great time here posing with the figures and watching the others who were visiting. The figures were realistic and seemed to be alive. Take your time and enjoy every minute.My only regret was the fact that my camera battery died and I could not take many pictures. The phone was not charged enough either.Would go back again. Everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leecabug
40,Unexpected Fun,"Thought a visit of the Wax Museum would be ""sterile"", and did the visit more for my teenage daughters, but was pleasantly surprised that it turned out to be fun visit and one of the better days on holiday. Booking online, certainly helps, as you were able to skip the queue. I was surprised to know that we were allowed to touch and get up close to the wax figures. We were just cautioned to not touch the face and hair. What I really liked about this Museum was that the Museum provided props, which you were allowed to use and take some interesting photographs. I thought that the Museum had a good mix of classic and contemporary celebrities, but would have loved to see more as we were having so much fund that I didn't want the visit to end.My only grievance is that when I placed my on-line order, I also ordered two souvenir brochures, but because they ran out, I could only get one. Some some smar alec, employee, brought me another advertising brochure and passed it off as a Souvenir Brochure. We were on a family holiday, all the way from South Africa and didn't appreciate being treated in this flippant manner. Nevertheless, the manager, agreed to post me the copy when they received their copies. I'll be very surprised if I do receive it though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ravesh
50,Fun,A trip to Hollywood would not be complete without seeing some movie stars. It was a bit pricey to get in but our family had a lot of fun with characters. Good way to spend a couple of hours!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JazzaT
50,Kind of hate to admit it- loved it!,My son wanted to go and we had a coupon for a free admission and a couple hours to kill- it really ended up being fun! Our only other wax museum experience was in SF where alarms went off if you got too close to the figures. Here you can cozy right up (just don't touch the faces). Right after opening it was quiet and easy to snap plenty of pictures. The 3-D (or 5-D???) movie at the end was fun too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kagardner
30,Why are criminals on display?,"So all in all, this was our second or third visit, and to our surprise, the exhibit changes. The bieber, for instance, was not on display in a far far corner behind a curtain. You blink, you miss him, or worse, walk right over him.His off-and-on girlfriend, Serena, was smack in the middle of the room. I wonder why.The dolls or figures are amazing. Some of them are so lifelike it really feels as if they are looking at you. Others, well, not so. But to be able to take photos and have fun is a cool diversion for an hour or so.Had I curated the exhibition, I would have removed the likes of Michael Jackson, but alas, he was never convicted. Lance Armstrong though, is convicted of cheating in the worst possible way. What is he still doing in the sports section??? Honestly? A worse role model cannot be found in sports. This cost you a star in my rating...We were there with a stroller and were asked to take the elevator. However, the elevator only goes up, not down, so we had to take the stairs down to the next level. Not that we mind walking, but it was odd to say the least.Madame Tussaud's is good fun. I can only hope their curators are more sensible in who they display. If an un-convicted Bieber is ""hidden"" behind a curtain, why not remove Armstrong altogether?I love some of the old classics, as well as some of the newer ones, and in hindsight of last night's announcement, I should've taken that photo with Robin Williams… May he rest in peace!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tumbleweed67
50,Excellent,"Brilliant worth visiting with your family kids love it, got to see some famous wax star. Lovely restaurant there for coffee and snacks , you don't notice a couple of hours there is goes quickly",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/187sharon
40,Mix with the stars,"Fun couple of hours, spend some time with the stars up close. Had a lot of fun as this was the first Madam Tussauds I had visited.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/493katew
40,More than expected,First time visiting a wax museum and was impressed with the likeness of the models! Also the set-up is pretty good with props available to take photos with the models. We got a two for one ticket deal from a tourist map of Hollywood so keep your eyes out for these deals don't pay full price!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Celestee89
40,Photo-ops fun!,"Visited this area to go the Walk of Fame and decided to spend an hour in the museum I expected a little more but it was fun taking photos with the wax figures. This is a good experience for those who want to get ''close"" to the stars. My favorite part was taking photos with president in the oval office. The photographer that was on staff was wonderful. She helped us with poses and the photos came out great!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bermt86
30,Nice visit for one time.,"this is kind of place, where you just fancy and say i have been there and done that. not so worth for the money but you can see the STARS in wax. the idols were fantastic and worth for single visit. cant spend that much to go second time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shanmugamrs
40,Very nice,It is very nice with a lot of high quality wax status for many celebrities. I spent nice time and it was fun. Recommended to visit when in hollywood.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/osamayoussef
40,"Great, fun, photo ops!!!!!","My family included my husband and 14 & 16 yr old daughters. We had so much fun posing with the characters!!!! I couldn't believe how you can touch them and get so close (face and hair are off limits though.....be careful). TIP: I found that if I aligned the camera so that their eyes state directly at you.....the pictures look more lifelike!!! We cracked up at ourselves!! You can sit down with the Godfather, escort Carrie Underwood, chit chat with Clooney, dance with Elvis, sit down for tea with Audrey Hepburn, and hide under Thor's cape.....just to name a few!!!!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zombie_slayer
40,Funny photo opportunities,"We loved posing with the figures. Definitely go during a weekday when it's slower to give yourself time to do that. Otherwise, you're battling a huge crowd!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/teachings4me
50,A must! And bring your camera!!!,If you are here in Hollywood or in this area for whatever reason you must stope here and visit.This wax museum is so awesome because you can pose for the picture with all this famous movie stars. You can do selfies or ask your friends to take the picture for you. Do group pictures also all of this are so much fun to do.Play with the props that they have here for you. Don't be afraid or embarrass to pose for your picture. Have fun in here,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrminky
30,nice wax museum but no digital photos available online for me ??,"The museum was worth the price. 3d movie was worth it too. Wax musuem officials (photographers) took photos of us which we bought at the end of the 4d show. However, I paid extra to getr the code to see all photos (7-8 photos) online but can only see 1 picture with the code. Not sure where the rest are. Got no response via email from photo company and so chance to relive memory is gone.Not happy. Thanks. Sam",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/subirp2019
40,How fun!,"Was so much fun to mess around and strike a pose with these famous people. Now, I know they weren't real, but holy cow did they look real! It was neat to see the true size of some of the rich and famous. And surprisingly, they were all pretty small! Had some fun picture opportunities.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tsander4
40,Up close celebrities,Got in using a 2 for 1 deal. Figures were interesting. Some were better than others. It is good that they have themed areas and encourage some interaction. One room shows some history and how figures are made! You will need about an hour and a half to go through all the rooms. We went early in the morning so it wasn't busy. All up it was OK but probably wouldn't go again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amandacO2999SE
50,You can believe they are with you,"Admission is 30$, but I found a half price coupon in my hotel room. So, for 45 $ (3 persons), it worth the price paid, not sure for 90$. You can also have discount on their website. If you are not to close, you can imagine they are real. Very interesting visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LyseMontreal
30,Just ok,"It was fun to see all of the wax figures, but once you've seen one, they are kind of blend in. We did it for the novelty but probably wouldn't go back even if they got a new figure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amberb141
50,Fun Place to Visit,"I hadn't been to a wax museum since I was a kid, and I went with my 13 y.o. son and we both had a great time. It's nice that you can get up close to the figures (no touching the faces or hair). I had an $8 off coupon in my hand while standing in line and someone took that away from me and handed me a 50% off, which was appreciated.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kay64
50,Worth checking out,We had a coupon and happened to be checking out the sights in Hollywood anyhow so we thought we'd check it out. I'm glad we did. We had a lot more fun than I thought we would have. The figures are so life like it's almost creepy. You can easily spend an hour or more checking it out. I took a picture with Betty White and my mom thought it was real. Lol,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/592renaem
40,Decent,Been to several Madame Tussauds and this one was little bigger than the others. Make sure to stop by if you have time while you are in Hollywood area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/raifusal
50,A lot of fun!,"Our family had a blast here! The figures are great and so life like! I loved the Kill Bill -Quentin Tarantino exhibit - it's one of my favorite movies! The figures of the old film stars were so fun, love Charlie Chaplin and James Stewart! We had such a great time and it was worth every penny!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scraphappy256
50,My teenagers loved it!!!,"First, we were in awe when we walked out of the (Mall) Parking Deck into a big open mall. Girls like to shop. :) We thoroughly enjoyed the museum. My teenagers took selfies with the stars!!! Oh My!!! Even I was impressed with the poses my kids came up with. It was good fun. We bought souvenirs for $5 (half-price at the $10 shop), ate lunch across the street, and enjoyed taking pictures next to the ""Hollywood Stars"" (sidewalk). The Mall service desk validates your parking ticket for two hours. That was good but beware the first 2 hours aren't free. The validation is for the first two hours for $2.00, then every quarter hour was $1.00. We were there for 4.25 hours = $11. Not too bad just know that parking decks are expensive in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WGwiz
30,Interesting place,"Very nice museum, some of the figures were so real even the eyes were so perfected that you expect them to move any second; it was surprising to find out that some stars are short in real size; however our joy was ruined by one of the workers (male) who appeared from no-where just to scare my 9 years daughter from taking my picture with me sitting at the White House desk next to president Obama stating that it is only allowed if they take the picture using their overhead camera (for money) - as if it is not enough paying about $90 for the 3 of us for less than 45 minutes visit. The female worker was sweet, polite and had no problem that we take this shot and there was no sign restricting photos. Overall nice place to visit in the middle of Walk of Fame",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/albert_sami
50,Great fun with a teen!,"This is the kind of place I always walk by in a rush, can't stand the thought of being such a tourist. But a 14-year-old daughter brings new experiences, so in we went. Amazingly, we had a blast. My husband took his look-alike shot with Bruce Willis and sat in the captain's Startrek chair. My daughter took her photo with any number of teen stars whose names I do not know. We did the Obama family shot in the Oval Office and I stood with John Wayne and Elvis, each for sending to my dad. In other words, total campy fun, and the price tag was high but not staggeringly so.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DbTX
50,holiday from the uk,Excellent exhibits excellent staff. Didnt have to queue up long either unlike the london uk one which you have to queue for hours to get in. Overall excelkent place to visit,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AkkoUk135
30,Nice place to stop and spend an hour,The museum was nice and clean. The figures were mostly good. However some looked way too small and thin. Getting to the museum was horrible. Came from long beach and the 30 min drive was an hour and a half. Getting back home took nearly 2 hours. The area around the museum is completely packed with tourists and not relaxing at all. The parking for the area is in a big garage that takes about 15 minutes just to get out of. Would not go back due to the area. Not too pricey for the work that went into the figures. You can spend as much time as you want in there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jlo999961
50,Loved it!!!,This is the 3rd Madame Tussaud's I have visited an I have loved them all.Our teenage boys weren't too keen when I told them what Madame Tussaud's was but once they saw a couple of their fav actors they were hooked!Great fun for all the family.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lisacunningham01
50,Get your celebrity fix at Madame Tussauds Hollywood!,"The majority of us never get to get close to our favorite celebrities, so this is a good alternative. The great features of this museum is that you can stand or sit directly next to the wax figures for up close shots. They also have props of hats, scarves, canes, etc to drape on yourselves for added photo fun. The story of Madame Tussaud is very interesting and I recommend reading her story at the end of the tour. To save some cash, use your AAA discount card.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2012Hotelsnob
50,Very Cool,"Three floors for around $30. We bought a City Pass bus ride for $60 which included the Museum, so we were happy. :)The wax figures tickled us to death. We were allowed to make photographs with them and we spent over an hour in there. The last stop is a floor with the history of the museum and how they make the figures. We enjoyed this immensely.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EllenSallas
40,Escape the LA heat,"In the heart of Hollywood, Madame Tussauds is worth a visit during your walk up the Walk of Fame to escape the heat and the hawkers. It's kitschy but fun to see the different figures and there's some interactive displays too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ilaeria
40,When in Rome...,"If you are going to a tourist hot spot like Hollywood, you gotta embrace the goofiness of it all! Yes, it's really expensive (at least get your tickets online in advance to same a few bucks), but it's kitschy fun! I've always wanted to check out a Madame Tussaud's, and I'm glad I did. The figures are all posed do you can get in photos with them -- almost making them look like candid photos. It is ridiculous and wonderful!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hleahh
40,Nice afternoon,"My daughter and I decided to visit Madame Tussauds to kill a few hours before attending a musical at the Pantages. We were pleasantly surprised at the fun we had there. Interesting facts to read and great pictures to take that make it a fun time. Glad I didn't pay full price, but I never intended to for a place like this. So make sure you find discount tickets. Allow about 2 hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/392KellyM
50,So Fun,this place is Awesome. the life like statues of celebrities were so cool. son took pictures with everyone from Obama to E.T. a must see place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheMobilityMom
40,It's fun..,"Madame Tussaud's is always fun, but this location is getting kinda worn down. I think it and some of it's statues need a bit of a facelift.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LisaAnn1091
40,Very Nice Place to Visit,"Went here while in Hollywood, very nice. My daughter and I had a very good time. The figures were very life like, some looked as they would start talking to you at any minute",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/960briane
40,Free as part of the Hollywood 'Homes of the Stars' Tour,We got free entry as we had booked the 'Homes of the Stars' Tour. Lots of very famous celebrities in Madame Taussaud's so we thoroughly enjoyed it. Each room was another surprise! We probably wouldn't have gone if we had had to pay the full price though.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ANH779
40,Surprised by how good this was,"We received free tickets with our Hollywood Famous Homes tour, I wasn't expecting much but was pleasantly surprised by how realistic most of the figures were. I liked the settings they were in also, made for great pictures. I'm not sure I'd be happy if I paid full price to enter though, however, coupons and deals are easily found so full price shouldn't be paid anyway. I also liked how the last room explained the process of making the figures. We were shocked to find out that they install each hair one by one!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TIA1966
50,Fun place to visit,"If you are in LA you just can't miss this place. Entertaining, nothing else. Everything in this town is about Hollywood and this is a place where we ""the ordinary people"" will get as close as possible to those stars :-). You can hug them, but no kissing as their skin is very fragile :-). Fun place, deifinitly worth seeing if you are in town.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ru66
40,Great Visit,"Excellent place to visit.Need to allow about 1-2 hours to visit depending how long you like to linger at each wax figure. Lots of great picture moments from both the ladies, lads and kids. Wouldn't recommend for kids under 6 as it would be hard for them to identify with the wax figures.Be careful of actors outside that offer to have their photo taken with them; only the to be asked for money. Take note they do get annoyed when you don't want to give them money. We didn't realise this was what was happening to begin with.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wandermore4
50,So much fun!!!,This was a perfect way to spend an afternoon! Looking at all of these wax figures it was sometimes hard to tell that they weren't the real people.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marysZ1ZR
40,More fun than expected!,"Normally, these types of museums aren't my thing, but I heard so much about them that I wanted to check it out with the rest of the group I was with. The prices are expensive, but if you go with a big group, you can get a better deal. We were able to get half off the price if we bought a $6 souvenir so definitely worth doing that!Anyway, it was a lot of fun getting to take pictures with the realistic looking celebs, although our group was a bit more creative and room some interesting pics. We have one where it looks like Justin timberlake is being pick-pocketed for his wallet! Lol. All in all, it was a great time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeyeA
40,We had more fun than we expected,"We went as a combined group, my sister in laws kids and our brood. I thought it would be some cheesy tourist rip off. WrongThe wax figures were very lifelike, perfect for photo bombing.They were also group around a particular genre. John Wayne, Jimmy Stewart in the old hollywood section. Action heros like Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bruce Willis on another floor.Tip for cheaper tickets, go to the Dolby theater up the street. It is the entertainment complex and where the Oscars are held. There is a California vistors centers there, where you can get discount coupouns for the museum and other attractions.Tip 2, park in the Dolby Center parking garage, (entrance on Highland Ave) then get your ticket validated at the vistor center and or any participating business. You will get the first 90 minutes of parking for free",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T5481QPadamb
30,"Sydney one is bigger, more realistic and better",Not the best madame tussauds i have ever seen. The sydney one has more realistic figures. It is fun you should still go but you do not need more than an hour there. Get the free pass with the 48 hr startours hop on hop off ticket,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ivana-banana
40,Worth an hour,A very good display of Hollywood Stars and US celebrities. Lifelike wax works that produced great photos and stories. We ( three mates) enjoyed the visit. Make sure you get a discount voucher from one of the Bars or vendors prior to purchasing your tics.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/873iang
40,Loved the SUPER Exclusive Bollywood section!!!,"Special Tip: Try to purchase the tickets online, those are discounted.3 floors of well done up wax creations.The guy at the entry level takes your pictures and hands out the card for you to download your pictures from the official website (really? well they were not able to trace my pictures despite me following up).Anyways, the good part, the elevator takes you to level 3 and you will be awe struck to see how real Beyonce, Rihanna, and JLO dummies look. Same floor with Tom Hanks, Nicholas Cage, Julia Roberts and Merly Streep and then exit towards Level 2.Level 2 has all the GodFathers, James Bonds, XXXs and the action/thriller genre. Before exiting to Level 1, it is the Beckhams, Woods, Bryants and the sports idols.Level 1 is my personal favorite ........... BOLLYWOOD ............. only 5 wax statues but makes me real proud. The statues could have been done up to look more real though. Also, before you exit there is a Souvenir section and the 5 dollar per item shops to ponder on. Overall, it is a joyful experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/crabclaws711
50,Loved it!,"I had my daughter and her friend who had just graduated from high school with me. They loved feeling like they were actually getting to 'see"" the celebrities through this experience. We enjoyed it. So life-like!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amymc001
40,"Pricey, but interesting.","This was really expensive, as was the parking close by. With that negative out of the way, we did have a great time. You can get as close as you like to the figures and pose for pictures, and it is always interesting to see how tall, tiny, brawny, bulky, celebrities are in 'real life'. We went late evening, around 8pm, and it wasn't busy at all. You're close to all the other stuff on the Walk of Fame, so make a day out of it. If you're not inclined to pay the price of admission, they usually have a couple of figures outside where you can pose and snap pictures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Elissa369
40,A must see on Hollywood Blvd,"Just good fun. Exhibits are well done, venue very clean. Don't make the same mistake we made by going to the other wax museum down the street first. There is NO comparison !!! Tussaud's did us a huge service by providing a significant discount after my wife explained that we went to the other wax museum by mistake. Well Done !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WendellB336
40,Even Fun For Locals,"My family of four found ourselves making the most out of all that is Hollywood Boulevard, after we were turned away from Disneyland, which was filled to capacity. Now you can imagine the mood in the car when you're told there's no room for you at the happiest place on earth. Somber would be putting it mildly. My husband and I suggested numerous alternatives, but they all met with the same (barely audible) grumble, ""we don't care - whatever"". Perfect! That means I can chose any place - so crazy and ever wacky Hollywood Boulevard, here we come. As I suspected, it didn't disappoint. Madame Tussaud's was definitely one of the highlights. The kids took pictures with very life like wax stars like Tiger Woods, The Jonas Brothers, Brangelina and Nick Cage. The shots kept getting more creative and LOL funny when they got to dress up like characters from some of their favorite movies. On our way out we caved to the pressure and had their hands casted in (color of your choice) wax and the kids loved it. This, in addition to visiting other sights on Hollywood Blvd., made for a completely unique and memorable day for these Southern California locals. I would recommend it to anyone that's looking for a fun and quirky day out in Tinsel Town.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thislifesgood
50,I loved this place!!!,Madame Tussrads was so much fun! There are so many wax models ranging from current celebrities to 70s icons etc.There are rooms and rooms full of models in poses which are fun to interact with.I highly recommend this place,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelBugged14
30,Nice to see,You can tell a lot of effort goes into making these wax figures. The detail is amazing and they can look absolutely real. You can pose with them and they provide you with costumes to help elevate the experience. Pictures won't fool anyone that you were hanging out with the stars but it is all fun especially with the family.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrentJ293
40,Wax vs Reality,This consists of 3 floors and is located right in the middle of Hollywood walk of fame.You do start from the upper klevel and work your way down.the models here are so real looking its amazing how close the creator of these amazing statues were to the real thing.My kids enjoyed this an so did I. The only downside was that it aint long enough (:,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jodecirossi
50,Really Cool,"I've been to the Madame Tussauds in San Francisco and I definitely liked this one better. The one in San Francisco is in a very old building, it's pitch black and you are all alone with these creepy wax figures. Even my mother said that she feels scared in there. This one is brightly lit and it looks more modern. My favorite part was that they allow you to touch the figures and take pictures with them. Pricey but fun. I'd visit again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GK19792014
30,Good fun - but smaller than some of the others I've visited,"I had two hours to kill in Hollywood before my flight home and decided as I'd only seen a couple of celebs courtesy of a TV show I was lucky enough to see filmed, that this would be the next best thing.I found a great coupon online giving me a $10 discount - but take note; if visiting after 6pm the admission cost drops to $15 anyway. Bargain.Well, despite being on my own I found plenty of willing tourists who would take my photo although maybe some stands to rest a camera on to take a selfie might be good?What I like about this venue is the interactive displays such as the Star Trek Captain's chair, ET bicycle and the T Bird car - although no pink ladies jackets available today :(I was disappointed that there wasn't Iron Man in the super hero section in fact except Spiderman, Thor and the Wolverine, the other characters were more action hero than super hero (but all very good regardless!). I also thought Julia Roberts was not as authentic as the one in New York or George Clooney.All in all a fun experience that took about an hour to go around. Probably more fun with two but don't be put off if you're on your own - everyone is very friendly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travel_junkie05
40,A fun time,"Always an interesting experience to see how life like and not so life like the figures are at the various museums throughout the country. A few of my faves at this particular one were Whitney Houston as Rachel Marron from the bodyguard, Snoop Dogg, Taylor Lautner, Marilyn Monroe in her ruby red dress,Justin Timberlake, and Jackie Robinson. For some reason out of the 3 museums that I've visited, I don't feel like they've gotten Michael Jackson's likeness quite right.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EricaMitchell685
40,Fun time!,"Had a great time, taking lots of photos with celebrities there. There are more wax celebs there than the Las Vegas version. Although the LV one had the 4D Avengers movie! It was an enjoyable experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/546JoyceK
50,Photo Ops with the stars!,"This is not just a wax museum. This is a place you can take seat and have your picture taken with George Clooney, make a deal with Marlon Brando's Godfather, dance with Elvis, sit in the ultimate drag race Grease car with John Travolta (with Pink Lady jacket, of course!), and block Kobe Bryant's shot at the basket. Oh, and of course watch my husband get down on one knee and propose to Raquel Welch in full bikini gear from One Million Years BC.The opportunity to interact with so many exhibits sets this attraction apart from the rest. We had a lot of fun taking pictures here, and there's something about this place that makes you want to get into character.The attraction allows you to go through the exhibits at your own pace, which is helpful. There is no guide (though I think there is an optional video tour for purchase, which we did not elect). But there are signs with interesting biography facts for each of the figures.There is something for everyone here -- characters from all types and decades of movies, sports figures, singers... even Simon Cowell in deep thought.This was a lot of fun, a great escape during vacation. Highly recommend that you visit and take a picture with your favorite character!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/midwestworldtraveler
40,Pretty neat,"This was a lot more fun then we expected. This was the last spot we hit after our week long vacation. My husband reluctantly went in thinking it would be a waste of money but he even had a really good time and snapped a pic with just about every celebrity. My 10 year old daughter enjoyed herself too. There are lots of ""sets"" where you can even use props to look like you are in the movie with the celebrity which was a lot of fun. The only down side was the staff takes pics in the very beginning and ending of the tour which we loved, they were so funny but just way too expensive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/poca1313
40,LA Vacation,"Awesome! We had a great time taking pictures and laughing with our teenagers. The wax figures are really so life like! The ending, an overview of how it's done, was kind of boring, would have preferred to see more! I say it's a great time to spend with your family! Kinda pricey...find a discount if possible!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeeAnn5072
50,so much fun,Brilliant... definitely worth seeing when in Downtown LA staff were amazing and very helpful had so much fun taking pictures.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dannia2014
50,Great fun!!!,We went to Madame Tussaud's in May 2014 and was pleasantly surprised!!! There are so many wax works and it is amazing how life like they are!!! There is also a great gift shop!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ClareMcG
40,Better than expected,"We visited Madame Tussaud's after receiving an offer for discounted passes while visiting the Chinese Theatre next door. We had about an hour to kill before heading off to a baseball game, so we decided to try the wax museum. We were pleasantly surprised.Our daughter had visited the Madame Tussaud's in New York, and was anxious to try the Hollywood version. I was less enthusiastic, but I have to say that it was enjoyable. Of course you can take pictures with wax representations of famous actors, both current and past. What we found particularly cool wasthat many of the figures were placed in ""sets"" from their movies.Overall, it was a good way to spend an hour or so, especially if you have discounted tickets - the $30 full price might be a little high, and discounted tickets are readily available.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Measuretwice8
50,Awesome Experience,"If you want a ""with the stars"" experience this is the place to go. The stars look like they are so real. Taking pics with all of them was pretty cool. A must go to place if in the LA area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kamma_13
40,Cool sculptures although a tad pricey for the size,"This year we went to Madame Tussauds Hollywood Wax Museum as part of a tour package, so we got a discount from the normal price of admission. Getting in was all right, the elevator up gets really cramped really quick. Once on the third floor, you have lots to look at, and it's pretty cool how you can pose with some of them. I got to sit down next to Simon Cowell and George Clooney, among others. The second floor was the superheroes and movies wing, which was really cool. You can stand in the shower posing with Alfred Hitchcock in the ""Psycho"" scene, pose with the Godfather, even the president. Overall, it is quite interesting, although for Hollywood I did expect it to be a little bigger, with more figures than what they had. It was worth it though, because it's great memories and lots of cool photo ops.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/minimacaz
40,Lots of fun taking pics with famous people!,"I love how they have made some of the exhibits interactive.For example, you can put on a boxing robe and face off against Rocky, put on a red hoody and sit on the bike with ET on the front, ride a camel next to Lawrence of Arabia & more.We got some gr8 fun pics from our visit.It is not huge (compare to the one in London), but definitely fun. We got a giggle on :)My tip is to get there early before busloads of tourist groups, who in our opinion were quite rude, jumping onto exhibits and taking their photos when we were just about to, seemingly oblivious to the fact that they were 'jumping' in our way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tubefeed
40,"Great place, lots to see!","Great range of waxworks, from celebrities, popstars, sportsmen, actors, royals and presidents. Nice place to walk around, admire and take plenty of photos.. Also got a chance to make our own wax hand, althought the que was very time consuming.. Still enjoyed!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gurdeepc2014
50,Madame Tussauds Hollywood is wonderfully fun,Great place to see the stars. We took tons of photos and most turned out great. A few looked very fake with the stars. Well worth the $28 to have some fun and stroll down memory lane. My personal favorite is Judy Garland. I found it very interesting that some of the stars are so tiny in height. Great times with good friend!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BeachLuvr1960
40,So much fun for the whole family.,"We came here with my husband, our 14-year-old son, and 19-year-old sisterafter watching a taping of America's Got Talent. Madame Tussaud's is located right in the heart of Hollywood and is a fun day trip in addition to other things you may have planned for that day. The day that we went they were giving a 50% discount on ticket prices so you may want to call ahead or ask if you are in the neighbourhood. It was fun to take pictures with the wax statues and admire all of the care taken to make them appear real. There is enough of a variety of statues to please all ages of fans from George Burns to Selena Gomez. There are even props that the museum provides to make pictures with Lady Gaga, Clint Eastwood, and President Obama that much more exciting. Note when taking pics w/ the statues: look in the direction that the statues are looking when you are being photographed to make them look even more real!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/siruly
40,Pleasant surprise,Saw a Travelzoo deal and decided to give this a try. Very nice facility. Staff very friendly. Loved the way you can interact with the wax figures. Definitely worthwhile.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/800BarbaraH
50,Great fun!,Went there with my family and I had a great time! I think its an ideal place to go out with family for the evening or something!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/965prayagp
40,The figures are very life-like. A fun time!,My hubby and I had a blast here posing with all of the wax celebrities. Some have props you can use too. I think we spent about 2 hours here. Silly fun!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LizGage
50,What fun!,I am sooo glad we did this! We had gone to see the Dolby Theater but it was closed for an event so we decided to tour this since it was on our Go LA card. Well I would've had no problem paying for it. We had so much fun posing with the wax figures like we were there. I think one of the best was getting on the bike with ET! Don't pass this by!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wambo
40,Great fun with the camera,"Touching down in LA after a month of travel through Mexico and Central America, I was hoping for some down time but my relatives had already planned an adventure packed welcome to their hometown which included a trip to Hollywood.We received discount vouchers on the street, which helped in cutting down the cost, which was not overly expensive to begin with.We spent a a lot of time posing with all of the Hollywood actors and pop stars. It was a really fun time and the work on the wax models is really well done, I had quite a few favourites, many who are now deceased, so this one way to get up close and personal.The building is multiple levels with different rooms, many have wearable props which adds to the experience. There is an opportunity to ride a camel and a bicycle which make for great shots.At the end of the attraction there is the obligatory gift shop and you can purchase the photos taken of you by staff at the beginning of the attraction.Definitely worth a visit and the kids will enjoy the exhibits too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kawm2003
40,Fun for Pictures!,"This was a pretty neat place! At first I was actually creeped out, it took a few mins to get use to haha. But it was fun for taking pictures! The staff is around to take some professional ones too I didn't purcahse any myself. But def a cool little place to stop in at.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrittanyWaters711
40,good,"we had tickets free with a tour we had booked with another company so decided to take a look around. upon entering your meant to have a crazy photo pulling loads of different expressions, we skipped this bit out of embarrassment more than anything with everyone else watching you pull 'scared' 'sad' 'happy' 'angry' faces. the walk around is good and theres lots to see, it can be very busy and you'll find some tourists are likely to barge you out the way regardless.. other than that a good half hour - hour for a nose! theres a small shop at the end which is well priced and has lots of nice bits!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nikkijr93
40,Bring you camera,"Spent a couple of hours here and had a great time, the wax models are really well done. A camera is a must with so many good photos to be taken inside.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gun_13
50,Had a great time!,"My sister and I took my 14 year-old son here. It was about $27 person. The facility was clean and well-maintained. The staff was cheerful, helpful and friendly. The tour is pretty much self-guided. You get off the elevator and just walk through. You can take photos and touch the figures as long as you don't touch the hair or face. We had a blast, dancing with a figure of John Travolta, etc. Some of the exhibits had props you could use to be in the scene for photographs, like a fake sword to fight with Uma Thurman in ""Kill Bill"". You could wander around as long as you liked, and sometimes we had to wait a couple minutes for photo ops. Most guests were polite and respectful to others and the displays, taking turns, etc. The figures are very lifelike and a little spooky looking, so my son thought it was a bit creepy. Overall, fun. We spent about an hour there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jyunllc
30,Realistic,"Had fun looking at the wax figures. Very realistic, was hard to tell between wax figures and real peopke at times.The displays were great and very interactive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emmafab
40,Fascinating and very entertaining,A worth wild venue for a very entertaining few hours. The settings and props that were made available simple added to the fun and great photo ops. Many actors showed up to entertain you. From Bob Hope and John Wayne to the likes of Justin Bieber and Lady Gaga. The only down side is the venue is slowly pricing it's self out of the reach of the average 4 person family.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/whiskmagic
40,Stare Gazing,"On our tour of MT we meet stars from Justin Timberlake to Snoopdog, Vindiesel to The Rock, the captions of USS Enterprise, Marilynn Monroe to Jane Russell and many many more. Worth the time,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ktfulton1
50,Great fun!,"In such a great location, right in the middle of the Walk of Fame! A good, fun attraction with so many good photo opportunities with the 'stars' including my favorite Jackie Robinson!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChloePayne90
50,Chilling with the Stars :),"Located smack in the middle of Hollywood, this is an easy to get to spot and worth the visit if you've never visited a Madame Tussauds previously. You can check out Hollywood's Walk of Fame, the Chinese Theatre, and then head into Madam Tussauds. My first ever visit (at the one in London) took me 3 hours, but this one took just an hour. Grab a city tour brochure from the hotel and you should find a discount coupon inside, which gives you about half off the entry fee. When you get in, you start at the upper most level and work your way down. The statues are cleverly themed and always fun for photo opportunities. Picture yourself sitting next to John Travolta in a scene from Grease, or having tea with Audrey Hepburn Breakfast at Tiffany's style, or commanding the space ship in Star Trek. There's bound to be something for everyone.Its also located very close to the subway. On my way out, just out the little shop, i got into the most amazing souveneir store, where everything was $5, needless to say most of my family members scored gifts from here :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RionaArjoon
50,Very Interactive,"I have been to the Madame Tussauds in New York and Vegas, and this is by far the best. The exhibits are more interactive than the other museums. Great photo opps.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/389billk
50,Amazing!!,"We went to Madame Tussauds and were not disappointed! When you first go in, you are sent up to the exhibit with the modern figures. There, you will see life-like statues of celebrities such as Beyonce, George Clooney, Justin Bieber and Lady Gaga. From there, you will go downstairs and see older celebrities, plus sports starts and action figures. Finally, you go to the final floor where you get to learn more about the process of making a wax figure! The attention to detail in these figures were phenomenal! The place is huge, there are many figures to see, so make sure to set aside a few hours for this. You're aloud to go right up to the figures and take a picture, and they also have a few props around (Such as hats, boas and other accessories) to make your photos with the figures even more fun! There is something for everybody to see here, and I highly recommend it to everybody going to Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Caribby96
50,Camera Required,"We enjoyed posing and taking pics with all the figures - but I think it would be quite boring if you didn't have a camera with you. The wax figures are very well done. We purchased a go card so this came with our purchase, if you do that, it's def worth a stop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/varipaul
40,"Amazing art, but less than we'd expected.","George Clooney, Michael Jackson, Pierce Brosnan, Brad Pitt, Robert Redford, Simon Cowell, Will Smith, Morgan Freeman, Fred Astaire, John Travolta, and the list goes on.... ladies, need I say more????",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Michayne
40,Had a Blast!,"My friend and I had a great time looking at and taking pictures with the wax figures. We went about a half hour-hour before the doors closed (they were still open inside for another hour or so until everybody left) and nobody was there. It was great to not deal with other tourists and crowds. It was also great to see how tall, short, small or big celebrities were/are.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/177janinec
40,Quite a lot of artists in there!!,"We always wanna go to one of this, we finally did, it was great, they have heaps of celebrities in there, I didn't expect that, we only had an hour free from our tour so we did this very very quick, took a few snaps then left.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tannya2013
50,WAY MORE THAN I EXPECTED,"I had a smart destinations card that included this museum and this is the only reason I went. I have been to other wax museums and thought they were all the same until now. The wax figures are beyond realistic, this is for sure worth a visit. Don't forget to bring your camera. I had to park in that mall parking its pricey but what are you going to do?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JayR1984
50,Great tours for the price,"We took a tour of Hollywood, sunset strip, Mullholland Dr,. Beverly Hills, etc. It was a really good tour and our tour guide was very knowledgeable. We got to see many Celebrity's homes. Those whom lived there currently or in the past. Our tour also included Madam Toussoud's Wax Museum which was so great! We all loved it. And everyone loved taking pictures with the celebrity wax figures that looked so real! They all had backgrounds, and Tony hawk's was awesome! There was even one scene with Spiderman that made you look as if you were hanging upside down.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dee93960
50,Way Hollywood,"Went on a Saturday and it wasnt crowded at all. Very well located on Street. Relaxed vibe. Many greats to see, Bob Hope to Liz Taylor to Master Chief. Fun interactivities. Photo ops galore.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kaidynsmom
50,Best Madame Tussauds,"I've been to Madame Tussauds in London and Sydney, and I enjoyed the one in LA so much more. There's great figures in there and its lots of fun. My ticket was included in my hop on hop off ticket, however I also looked at tickets online and found it much cheaper than the London and Sydney museums. It wasn't very busy when I went which worked out great. Highly recommend!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cookiesncream27
40,Pricey but fun,"We round $5 off coupons from people handing out coupons on the street, which was the only reason we went in. I'm glad we did go in because it's really amazing and interesting. There are facts about each wax figure and a video at the end which shows how it's all done. You can also get a wax mold of your hand! There were enough new stars to keep the kids entertained and interactive figures where you can put on costumes/hats as well as older ones from long ago.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AZgyrl
40,Had Fun Figures Are Great - But The Novelty Wears Off,I had a lot of fun visiting but after about the second floor the novelty wore off. Figures are really lifelike and our pictures came out wonderful. Make sure you go with someone fun who is happy to take lots of photos. Biggest tip I can give is don't bring along a heavy bag as you are constantly taking it on and off for photos :) Also they do have staff there taking some photos with popular figures its worth taking one because at the end you can purchase them and you may just really like one :),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MissSimmi
50,Soooo fun!!!,"We had a blast here! We were on the walk of fame and were hesitant to spend almost $40 each to get in, but it was so worth it!!! Our pictures from our time here are priceless! HIGHLY Recommend! We also went to the ""Wax Museum"" down the street because it was a part of Ripley's believe it or not, and Madame Tussauds' is 200 times better!! A must when visiting the walk of fame!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/COgirlinCA
50,Best Madame Tussauds!!,"Been to 4 Madame Tussauds, But this has to be the best! It's layout is amazing! (The later/earlier you go, the less people that can get in your way!) The location is on Hollywood blvd, much better than the other wax place a couple blocks up the street.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AshleyMitchellO
30,A little bit disapointing,"I did Madame Tussaud in New york this summer, and i really liked it a lot! So nice!I was really excited by the idea to visit another location of that museum. But it was a little bit disapointing, there is not that much statues (in comparaison to NYC), in NYC there was the Beatles, Elvis Presley, One direction, many artists, Princess Diana, Prince William and Kate, Presidents (Kennedys, Bush) Michele and Barack Obama (there is just Barack in Hollywood). There was also Gandhi, Nelson Mandela, and some other important person . It was nice and still amazing but I expected much more, because it is Hollywood and they could have done something more ""wow"". However the quality of the work done for all that statues is still amazing, and I enjoyed it !And also, the famous Marilyn Monroe statue was outside (the one where she is making her hand prints ), there is another Marilyn inside the museum but I much more prefer the other one, and we could not take ""good picture"" with it, because there was many people around. Another time maybe!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/731annec
50,Too fun!,Everyone needs to go! I loved posing with my favorite celebrities. Everything was well maintained and staff was friendly. The props were cool but some definitely needed replacing. My favorite was Johnny Depp and Marilyn Monroe but all were neat!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/616savannahj
50,Awesome for Everyone!!,"Having been to Madame Tussaud's in New York with just my husband and myself, I was super excited to take my 5 & 6 year old girls who are quite in to celebrity culture. After the initial creep out feeling, the girls had a great time running from celebrity to celebrity getting their picture taken. Hits for them were Rhianna, Simon Cowell, Lady Gaga, Snopp Dogg, David Beckham, but most of all.. Michael Jackson. My oldest wondered why he was all the way at the end, as she felt he should have been first! It was nice the different costumes/accessories you could put in to enhance your pictures. My girls enjoyed actually skate boarding with Tony Hawkes and playing basketball with Kobe Bryant, and being a Pink lady in the Grease scene was a blast. Overall it was a great experience. We bought our tickets as part of the Hollywood Citypass, so it was definitely worth the money we paid, as we got t go on multiple attractions. A great day had by all. It is too bad it is so short. Would be nice if they let you go through again,or as many times on the day you redeem your ticket.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CharlotteDouglas5
50,Really Interesting!,This is probably the best Wax Museum on earth! The statues are magnificent! They look real!!! It was an amazing experience!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/171marialuizam
40,Lots of fun,My two preteen girls were so excited to see their favourite celebs. Most of them look very realistic....especially Snoop Dog.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MiaVan
50,It was a fun time! No pressure no move quickly.,"This was a fun way to spend some time on Hollywood Blvd. There were fun costumes to put on, and nobody pressured you to hurry. Everyone was friendly and you could take time to take photos, and of course people would take your photo if you took theirs. A great time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I_get_around2014
30,Don´t like much,I don´t like much... some people in my grou like so-so... go only if you combine this attraction with other and did not pay much to it (you can combine this attraction with recomended Dolby Theatre - search on-line for tickets).,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LuxSkypeWalker
40,Great fun,Good place to visit when its quiet...as you can get the pics without the crowds. Had a good time...lots of celeb's to see. Got a voucher for 2/1 entry from our hotel.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Blackjacknz
40,Not as good as London experience but still fun,"Teen daughter and I hopped over there one evening and didn't get there till one hour prior to closing which was 10 pm. Think it was about $46 for the two of us.Reliable Chase bank ATM opposite if you need cash.We got lots of photos with all the expected celebs some of which were not great (Justin B) and some were fantastic - eg Steven Speilberg.The best part was the props they give you, the hats etc to make your pics even more fun. Loved the Oval office desk for Barack and the car for Grease.Combine with shopping in local Gap and mall if that takes your fancy but careful not get way-layed time wise like we did!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/haqsta
50,"great fun, and great pictures!","Great fun taking pics with all our favourite stars from stage and screen. We went early in the morning, so it wasn't too busy. I imagine it would be really frustrating trying to take pics of each other with crowds of people keep getting in the way! They open at 10am - be there when they open",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pennypickle
40,Overpriced Fun,"My wife and decided to make a quick run through Madame Tussauds while walking down Hollywood Blvd. Aside from the high admission price, we thoroughly enjoyed our visit. The figures were eerily realistic and make for some fantastic photo opportunities. The staff that we had exposure to were both friendly and helpful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jtex
40,A spontaneous visit turned out to be so much fun.,I was curious to visit since I had been at Madame Tussaud's in London and was not disappointed. My adult children weren't interested in going but gave in and we had so much fun. Our favorites were the Godfather and the President. I would say the majority of figures were spot on!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pennepasta
30,"historical - not only the museum, also the celebs.","I didn't like it too much, because a lot of the celebs are known by my grandparents, but not by people of my generation and the celebs I knew, look completely different nowadays, because they were made 20 years ago (Tom Hanks in Forest Gump, Silvester Stallone in Rocky, ...). I think they could use a refresh.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelgH2278CG
30,Fun for those looking for fun photo opps with current and past celebs,"I did a pretty quick run through here just viewing all of the wax figures and taking some photos with my favorite ones. It is pretty costly, so you really need to have an interest in the photo opps. I can see high school age students having fun here. It's not something I'd pay to do again, but it was fun for a mid-afternoon free period.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travelchick576
30,Waxing is fun,The admission was $26 but there are $5 discount coupon's everywhere. It's a fun place to spend an hour. The wax figures of celebrities are very realistic. You are allowed to touch them and take photos but are not allowed to touch the face and hair. There are a few stations with props that you can use to enhance your photos. The self guided tour provides details about the process of making the wax replicas and a little information about the celebrities themselves.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lightningboy
40,Scarily realistic wax statues,"It is not cheap, but overall it was worth the price of admission. The three floors of wax figures are so realistic that you find yourself apologizing for walking in front of them. You can actually get up next to them since they are not behind glass or Anything. It is amazing how real most of them look. There is a small section at the end that focuses on how they are made, which helps you understand why admission is so high. It took less than an hour to walk through and there was no wait at ten am Saturday morning. Next to the famous Chinese Theater, you swing over there to see the feet and handprints in concrete.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Live2traveldaworld
40,place of giggles,Didn't have high expectations but was surprisingly fun. If you're happy to be a little wacky in front of the camera you will have a good time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cupcakebaby1
40,Eeeeerrrrriely real,Fun way to spend a couple hours especially if you like taking silly photo's and enjoy Hollywood movie trivia. Some of the figures are done so well - such as Snoop Dog - others don't quite hit the spot but overall really well done.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sh56703
40,Alot of fun to visit,"We had to visit Madam Tussaud's while visiting Hollywood. The wax figures were great, very lifelike, and looked exactly like the personality they were meant to be, with only a few exceptions. We took many photos with the figures, and had a lot of fun. The museum was not cheap, but well worth the cost.The line to get in was not long as some others complained, however the clerks were extremely slow, taking over 5 minutes for a simple transaction. We could understand what took so long to take the payment and hand out a ticket.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HunkyJoe
40,A little fun,"Was fun took lots of pictures! Make sure you have lots of battery power! Nice mix of movie stars, musicians, sports stars and characters.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/81bethh
50,Cheesy but Fun!,"My teenage daughters hounded us to take them to Madame Toussauds in Hollywood, much to my husband and I's chagrin. It was not cheap (approx $70 for 4 people), but it did end up worth it for an hour of silly fun! We took tons of hilarious photos with all kinds of wax celebrities (current and from the past). Some looked so real, you thought they would jump out at you. We learned some interesting facts about the wax figures from the staff (if you asked), and at the end there was an area where you could make a wax figure of your own hand. Kids love this! Overall, it was great. Even my husband who hates this type of thing enjoyed himself. I would definitely recommend this to L.A. visitors, especially if you have an hour to kill in between activities. Thumbs up!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/namastegroup
50,Absolutely fun thing to do,"I had no intention to visit a wax museum when I planned the trip. But we got free tickets for buying 2 days passes with hop on bus tour, so we decided to venture in before we took the bus. I had no idea that we were going to have so much fun! Some of the celebrities look so much like the real thing it is amazing. Make sure to bring your camera. This place may bring out your inner child.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fungrc
40,Cool Wax Museum,"My preteen daughter REALLY wanted to see the wax museum, I wouldn't have picked it myself. I pre-bought my tickets from their website where it said you did not need to print your confirmation you could just take your smartphone and show them the confirmation. We had to stand in a huge line of people who hadn't bought their tickets yet even though we had the confirmation on our phone. Those who printed their confirmations and brought them, got to skip the line and go right in. Would have been nice to know that ahead of time!!Otherwise we had a good time, the kids took pictures with everyone they recognized and even some they didn't. Great $5 gift shop at the exit of the museum too.Parking - the parking garage behind the museum fills up quickly. When full, there is another parking garage also on Orange that offers parking for $12 max per day. We ended up parking in that garage.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/craftywriter
50,So much fun!,"I'd venture to say this was our family's favorite thing in Hollywood. It was nice and cool inside, that was the first great thing LOL since our visit was during a particularly hot and humid week.The likenesses of the celebrities are pretty amazing, and being able to ""interact"" with the displays is a lot of fun. You are allowed to touch the figures but not the faces. We just had a great time, it was included with our ""Go Los Angeles"" card purchase, and I'm glad. We might not have gone otherwise, and boy would we have missed out!On our way to the museum there was quite a ruckus on part of our walk from the Hollywood Museum to the Wax Museum; I had no clue what it was until I heard someone next to me say: ""Ms. McEntire! Reba!"" and lo and behold there was Reba McEntire in front of me, coming over to acknowledge the person who was yelling to her. That was a neat surprise. I guess that Vince Gill was getting his star on the Walk of Fame that day, and I believe she was there as part of that. Unfortunately I didn't get to see him (he's one of my favorites).Take time to visit Madame Tussaud's; you won't regret it! (Our visit was in September 2012, but I picked February 2013 since it was the closest date).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TamiJo42
50,More than your typical Wax Museum!!,"I've been living in Southern California for all my life and this was my first time going to Hollywood and going to Madame Tussauds is a must go, it's not just a wax museum it's more than and if you buy your tickets online you save more money ! I'll be coming here more since I did buy the gold pass (:",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GJAIME_21
50,Fun for everyone,"Great location and price is ok, not a big fan of museums but this one is the real deal. The models are so real looking really makes you think twice, forget the rest this the best. Don't forget your camera lots of photo chances",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlexV424
30,Interesting but not great,"Peaceful stroll, there are some very good likeness, Godfather - can get a photo with it sitting down. And great one of Ben Hur, Charlton Heston.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tonycim
30,nice but over priced,nice but over priced worth the deal if combined with a package. Also seems to be the same theme at other locations,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StephStx
50,Do this,"I had never been to a wax museum, and foolishly assumed they were tourist traps with mannequins made up to resemble stars. So I was completely unprepared for this tour. ""Realistic"" is a good word for what you'll find here, but doesn't do a great job of preparing you. In the director's room, I bumped into someone because I was taking pictures. I turned to apologize for stepping on his foot, and found myself face to face with Martin Scorcese. An extremely good Martin Scorcese who bore me no ill will. The museum was interactive, with lots of ways to dress up and get personal with the statues. There was also a very informative show at the end which demonstrated how the models are made. It featured Beyonce, and that was where we lost most of the men in the tour. The only criticism I can offer is that Iron Man was missing from the comics room, and I would have liked to see that. I had to settle for Vin Diesel, which is by no means a step down. The Spider Man display was pretty awesome too. (Hint: Turn the camera over or the shot won't work.)We took this tour after the museum closed, which probably greatly enhanced the experience. There were no other tourists. Highly recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rbnhoodga
50,Great time to be had by all,"My Husband and I decided to pop into Madame Tussauds after a long day out sight seeing.Wow are we both glad that we decided to do this.We had a wonderful time looking round all of the wax figures, getting photos and the staff there were more than happy to help us with any questions we had.Just be ready to stay for hours as there is so much to see and do!I would suggest going first thing in the morning or later in the evening as they seem to be the best times to go if you want to avoid the crowds.Can't wait to visit our next Madame Tussauds!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lovetotravel22175
40,Fun activity if you have time to spare,"My ticket for this was included in the City Pass and I went one evening at 7ish when I had some time to spare. It was good fun and I'm glad I went as it very movie based, not so much historical stuff as other countries have. I was a solo traveler and having people there to take photos is great, especially as the deal at the end is very good ($35 for all photos plus digital files).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarijkeLondon
50,Great afternoon activity,"Great location, more figures than any other one I've gone to in the world. Worth taking a quick visit.Loved Patrick Swayse on the log!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CassandraK777
50,Great Fun,"The best way to have photos taken with the stars :) Seriously though the figures are very well done and the fact that you can get so close and even touch, (not the face) is pretty good. We didn't have a lot of time but still managed to spend about an hour. What was interesting to me was the mix of old and new stars, a lot the I knew from 60s, 70s, and 80s and then some that my 15 year old was keen to see. Very friendly staff, interesting museum and reasonably priced. A fun afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rodgerskay
40,Good while it lasts,"My family and I went to Madame Tussand's on Friday evening. Luckily, I bought discount tickets online (saved me about 40% per person) and had no problem getting into the museum. We had a good time taking pictures with many of the wax figures and would sometimes think someone is standing next to us but its really a person in wax! Weenjoyed the variety of people depicted in wax -- theres something for everyone. There were plenty of places with MT employees that would take group or individual pictures for you and you could buy those pictures at the end of your tour if you wanted. Well, this is where my good trip went bad.We decided to buy a package of the pictures since we didn't have an opportunity otherwise to take group shots. The Holiday package was advertised as 4 6x8 pictures, an ornament, and a thumb drive with the rest of your pictures as digital prints. The only way to make this worthwhile to us was to get all of the pictures we took to take home as digital prints. One of the employees claimed she couldnt find some of the pictures we took (we were only there for an hour and a half at the most--not sure if she really tried to look for them) but she said if we were going to buy the package, we could retake the missing shots. So we retook some of the pictures and bought the package. Of course, when we get back to our hotel to show the others what we did, there's NOTHING on the thumb drive. I know buying the pictures was a ripoff anyways becsuse it was expensive but I still thought it was a nice way to remember the trip when we all go back to our respective cities. I've called back multiple times to get either my pictures or a refund but I've had no luck reaching a person to help me.Bottom line, you'll have fun but don't buy the pictures!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/loconicoco
40,"Fun,exciting,amazing","To enter I stood in line for around 10mins but once to the front you're able to get your photo taken that they later impose different scenes into, it's cheesy and quirky but fun. Then through to the museum which was amazing, the talent it would take to create these figures is beyond words... Loved the figures in little movie scenes. Hannibal lector was the creepiest by far. All in all a pretty great place to see if you have time. The wait time to enter is a downside and it was very busy but still enjoyable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/159cassandrab
40,Good fun,"We had tickets as part of a tour we were on and loved it, some of the figures are amazing, this exhibit is heaps better than the one in vegas, merryl streep, johnny depp and elvis were incredible! Along with the older stars, there were a few people there but you have heaps of time to take photos and pose and stuff.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chriso328
40,Had a great time meeting celebrities,My daughter and I decided to go here to kill time before our flight home. We had so much fun taking photos with the life like celebrities. I didn't realize how tall (or short) some of these celebrities were.We spent about an hour taking photos and enjoying the museum. Recommended. Tons of fun!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mocha954
50,amazing,amazing and so lifelike. Well worth the visit. Has most stars in there and I like the way they have grouped them. No one rushes you so you can take as long as you like and as many photos as you want.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sandy22NewZealand
50,Strike A Pose!,"Madame Tussauds is a wonderful way to spend an afternoon in Hollywood... right off the boulevard. The statues are so life like that it is almost scary, and mingling with the wax stars and posing for pictures is not just allowed, but encouraged! The settings that accompany the figures are also amazing, and they really make the pictures that are taken seem authentic! This is a definite ""must visit""!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DestinationDiaries
50,Lots of Memories,It was the coolest thing to do. There was no ropes and we took lots of pictures! It wasn't cheap but it was vacation so what are you going to do :),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alwaysdreamin1965
40,More fun than I thought it would be!,"We only went here because it was across from our hotel and I was looking for something ""Hollywood"" for the kids to do while in town for a wedding. What a hoot! My kids had the best time. They posed with every figure there and begged me to take more and more photos.Some of the figures were extremely realistic, others a tad run down. They could definitely fit some more stars in there as well. A little sparse in some rooms but still a ton of fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MichelleM650
40,Lots of Fun,"The wax museum is fun, but clearly over-priced, but so what, we had lots of laugh's standing next to the figures! I mean they are so life-like, in fact Kate is convinced that Brad Pitt eyes were following her around the room! My only complaint is that we had capacity for more of our favorite star's!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KateCharlie
50,Fantastic,We loved this wax museum it is a must it was fun nice and cool in there after walking around in the heat. As you enter they get you to stand there while they take a photo you can chose not to. We thought for the price it was good there are people handing out discount vouchers along the strip so take them you save $5 off the entry fee. Some hotels have these also. You can get up and close to the statues and take your own photos it is fun. They have a interesting fact board telling you how long it takes to make each body part also some photos step by step it is amazing. There are so many Hollywood favourites and you can get to be apart of the movie scenes grease was my favourite they have the pink lady jackets to put on and sit in the car or sit at the presidents desk and answer the phone like I say a bit of fun you won't be disappointed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pinkygirl29
50,Amazing!,"Ok, there are many wax museums out there; we get it.This one is just fun...not too expensive, given you are in LA, after all. Lots of movie stars, freedom to get up close, take pictures, and not be chastised for touching. Loads of air conditioned fun on a hot day. Info on how wax figures are made was quite interesting. Definitely recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ST23
40,View your favorite celebrities overlooking Walk of Fame,"I was in LA and wanted to view the Walk of Fame. I saw MT's marquee and decided to stop by. There is a valet parking garage right around the corner with reasonable(for LA) rates. I parked it there and went in.The tix for MT are a bit on the high side, but it's a unique experience. You are informed that you can touch the statues, as long as you don't touch the face or hair. A few of the celebrities don't look 100% like their real-life dopplegangers. Some statues should not be there anymore(Lance Armstrong) IMO. But, all in, it's a fun chance to take pics up close with your favorite celbs.The museum has some interactive displays. I took a pic in the Captain's Chair on the Star Trek Bridge. You can take a pic sitting on Elliot's bike from ET. Take a pic crossing swords with Uma Thurman's bride from Kill Bill, and a few others.The displays are broken down by genre, and there are a few great opportunities to take pics of the street below you as well. It takes about an hour to go thru, unless you really take your time. If you're into this kind of thing, it's great to experience, esp. since there's only a few MT's out there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/838greggr
30,Great fun but kind of expensive,"We had a lot of fun in the museum. It only took about one hour to go through because it's rather small. We did have to wait for pictures with the figures as there were quite a few people there.I did think it was expensive, we had a $5 off coupon for each adult which made it $21.95 per person. I see others posted they had 50% off coupons, I think $10 is a much more reasonable price for this.My recommendation is to go but really try to find a good discount, it's not worth $20 a head....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mpls001
50,A Fun Place,"My husband and I had an unexpectedly good time at the wax museum. We have been to wax museums before, but the quality of these figure far surpasses anything we have seen before. They also have many of the figures set up in ways that make for excellent photo opportunities. We had a great time posing for pictures with the ""celebrities."" It is also conveniently located on the strip next to the Chinese Theatre.The museum is a bit pricey for what you get, but we got in free with our Go card. We also saw some coupons and other discount opportunities along Hollywood Blvd, so look out for these so you can save a bit of cash. Be sure to stop in and see it. You will have a good time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/91shannonk
30,Average wax museum little small,Wax figures are well done. Museum is a little small. And I was sad that some of the figures that I knew once were there are now gone. Boo.We got this for free thank god as we booked a storyline tour.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KirstyMacIntosh
40,A lot of fun,"It was worth the trip. We got 50% off coupon from a visitor's book in our hotel, so my family of 5 got in for around $50 (although 1 was 2yrs old so she was free). You can touch the statues and many of them include props which allow you to get into the scene with the characters. There are characters from the golden age through today, from music, TV, Movies, and Sports. The statues are very realistic as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/958ryanh
40,A good once off,"Fun to go, good photo opportunities so make sure you take a camera or your phone!Isnt as big as first thought.. Maybe take 2 hours.. I think we were there for about 1.5 hours and that was taking our time.Good location and easy to find.. You can find heaps of fliers to get entry cheaper usually 25% so keep an eye out for them.. or just ask at the desk!!They also have wax hand moulding towards the end of your self guided tour which is a bit of fun for kids.. Cant remember how much it was.. maybe $20 or something.. You can choose which colour and how you want your fingers shaped etc",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lovepuffin_blogspot
50,Pretty fun.,"We got a free ticket with the purchase of a Starline Tour (which sucked). Granted I had never been to a wax museum, but I had a ton of fun. I was very pleasantly surprised. It was definitely something fun to do right there in the middle of everything. We got some hilarious pictures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/w4126
50,More fun than expected!,"We decided to go to Madame Tussauds kind of on a whim while visiting Hollywood after receiving a flier offering a discount coupon from someone on the street. We were a little hesitant to pay that much money for a wax museum, but decided to give it a try. It was absolutely not what we expected. We had so much fun taking pictures with all of the displays! The displays are well set up so that you can pose with the wax figures and really look like you are with the person. We came away with some awesome funny pictures. As with anything like this, there was some difficulty with children running around and getting in the way of pictures and some crowding near popular displays that caused us to have to wait to get a picture or to walk away without getting a picture we wanted, but overall it was one of the most fun things we did in Hollywood. It was definitely worth the price and we would definitely go back!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/669gayleb
50,Had a blast here!!,My family had a blast here during our visit to hollywood!! I thought it was more fun than knotts berry farm!! Lol. We will definitely be back!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kahea96744
40,Nice experience but can improve...,"There needs to some improvements made.. especially for the lighting inside, so you can take clear pictures. Also they need to have a concierge to keep strollers and bags for families that are with children.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/narayankumarr
50,Great but son disappointed !,This is way better than I was expecting. Enjoyed posing with the celebrities. Good range of people and well set up. One of my young boys was disappointed that iron man was not on display even though he was shown out front in advertising (apparently he was in for repairs?) We all had a great time. One confusing thing though is that it is not clear that the display is on all 3 floors of the building. you start on level 3 then we were about to leave feeling disappointed when we noticed that there were 2 other floors below. clearer signed would sort this out.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jamfactorynz
30,Nice place to spend an hour or so,I enjoyed this more than I thought I would. I bought my tickets as a package with universal studios so i didnt end up paying the full price - dont know if it would have been worth it if i had paid the full price.I was good fun to pose with all the stars and they wasnt a lot of people so we were never waiting too long to do so. Some of the waxworks are just incredible and look sooo real - the hannibal one is quite scary when you look into his eyes- others not so much!It didnt take very long to walk through everything but it was good fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/net86
50,Spectacular,This display is well set up. The stars are placed so that you can get your photo taken with them. Sometimes you had to take a second look to see if it was a person or part of the display. A must to visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aussieguyb
50,More fun than I expected!,I really didn't expect to enjoy this as much as I did. It's the interaction that really makes this special. My family and I had so much fun posing and acting silly with the figures! And they really are well done. Almost too well done! It did give me a creepy feeling at times!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CCBosh
40,Good fun!,"This is a great attraction, I had fun with taking photo's and the staff there are really great at helping you take photo.s if your solo.They put the stars in fun positions defiantly worth a visit.It was kinda of expensive though that was my only down point.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NickyC781
10,They stole money from my purse. DO NOT GO THERE.,"I was there on Sept 17th 2013, I forgot my purse on the second floor for no more than 10 minutes and when the front desk guy returned it to me, everything was in there except for $600 in cash, I know it was my fault, but I'm pretty sure the guy on the front desk took it, he was pretty nervious about the whole thing (blonde small guy with a hordeolum in one of his upper lid), I spoke to the manager and she told me I had to fill a police report in order to see the footage to determine if someone took the money, I'm mexican and I was leaving the next day so I didn't fill a police report, besides the manager told me there was almost no chance to get my money back even with a police report, so I'm pretty sure this guy stole the money and the manager could've done something else than tell me to fill a police report, so I'm never ever coming back to this place of thieves and I'm going to make sure to tell my story to anyone I know.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/11lizbeths
50,so detailed!,This was my first time visiting a wax museum. I was utterly blown away. The wax figures were just so lifelike. I also found it really cool to see how exactly how tall some celebrities are. No complaints whatsoever.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/753PeterB
50,Fun Place,I have seen members reviewing this place and comparing it to the one in London. I have also seen the one in London but as a teenager and don't remember much of it. But while visiting this place I had lots and lots of fun taking some funny and memorable photos. THe one Picture that I love the most is taken with Mr. Obama in his office :) take your time and have fun with those pics.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sharnjit_Sondh
50,Have fun - don't just walk through,We had a ball getting involved. We so many people just walking through like they were at the Louvre. These are accessible for a reason - for people to be a part of the scene. Get ready to take lots of pics. Oh - and look for discounts before you buy. They're everywhere.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MES3605
30,great figures but very small,"the figures are great. Whitney Houston's one is breathtaking, considering that it was done after she passed away and they could not work on her original face. All other figures are impressive. But the exhibit is too small and compared to London' s has less figures. I would charge less.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarioNer944
30,"Great Figures, but Smaller than Expected","We figured we had to go here while in LA, so we did. Thank God we had a BOGO deal because I would've regretted paying for two full price tickets. I found the exhibit quite small. It is 3 levels, but there is a LOT of space in between the figures so it seems a bit empty. The figures are life-like and I did enjoy seeing them, but I was hoping for more current A-list stars, rather than 50% of the stars being before my time. I didn't recognize a lot of the stars on the second floor but hey, if it's your age range, then you might enjoy it. I was told the NY Madade Taussads is much bigger and seeing as I live there, maybe I'll go there next.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rebeccaaJ9358KB
50,Great place very realistic,"We weren't planning on going here but past it n like the figurines we saw. Spoke to the guy outside n ended saving money on the entry fee. Had a great time looking at all the characters n reading about them. Take the pictures as you walk around by the workers, great offer at the end.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ljretires
50,"In a very desolate city, there is one fun thing to see.","Very fun to interact while picture-taking. Keep in mind that others are doing the same so you may need to wait a bit. Not long. It doesn't matter if you prepaid, you still have to wait in line to show them your prepaid receipt. The figures look very real. Betty White was creepy because it looked like she was looking right at you. Prices seemed reasonable. Parking is around the corner and construction is happening but it's pretty easy to get into it. All in all, I'd go back again to this site.....maybe not LA so much.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Becker4Pack
30,Look for a discount,"This was a fun tour, but a few warnings:1. There are many discounts available (coupons, etc), many for half off.2. Madame Tussauds won't validate parking for the lot directly under them (?!).3. They try to up-sell you when you buy tickets.So, five stars for the wax figures themselves, and one star for the rest of the experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ReviewBoySac
30,Decent but pricey,"I wasn't too impressed with the variety and number of wax figures at the museum. The price was $26.95 and after about 45 minutes we felt like we had seen it all. Many of the models are very realistic and it's fun to pose with your favorite stars. We had two kids with us and navigating with the strollers was a nightmare so keep that in mind if you have kids. Ultimately, I would have spent my money elsewhere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BigMikeColorado
50,Good Display,"This is one of the best Madame Tussauds locations. The Hollywood room is amazing and unlike any other locations.Don't pay full price, find a coupon or something.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jcisinthehouse
40,"Fun, bring your sense of humour and camera.","The figures aren't all easy to recognise. Posing with them and having a laugh are the best bits. Cute photo option at the start with a large cardboard Hollywood sign behind, was worth it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Forndoggy
40,Get up close and personal,Wax figures that are life size of many of the most famous people in Hollywood from then and now. Amazing detail and many photo opportunities!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmelL295
30,If you have time to waste and can't find anything else to do,Boring for most but if you're star crazy it's a chance to take pictures with people you could never get close to.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aussie1fan
50,a must see in hollywood,madame tussauds wax museum in Hollywood is awesome. my husband and I has so much fun taking pictures and the wax people look so real..they had props so you could really get into the character......... a must see in hollywood,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/crawfordsusan
40,Sooo much fun + great pictures,"So you are in Hollywood and you haven't even seen any celebrities ? Go to Madame Tussauds Wax Museum and you'll have so much more fun that trying to spot a celeb eating at a restaurant. Plus you can take so many great pictures !!! Wax Figures look so dang real and some of them even kinda creepy... Good tip: if you pose with them, don't just stay next to them smiling. Put that red sweatshirt on, get on the bike with E.T. and pretend like your pointing at his planet. But have to admit that after awhile it got kind of boring, even though there wasn't a lot (like really a lot) of figures... to me I'd rather see people like Aguilera, Rihanna, Eminem, etc than some Bollywood stars.You can still see: Beyonce, Madonna, Simon Cowell, Snoop Dogg, Tiger Woods, Lady Gaga, Brangelina, Nicolas Cage, Morgan Freeman, Audrey Hepburn, Uma Thurman (Kill Bill) and many more. You won't regret it after you see pictures. Admission is about $25.Dislike: I couldn't take a picture with Obama in his office. Some places were with a photographer from museum to take your picture and you had to pay for them. Price ? $25. Way too much. And the photographer lost my picture! They said I could go back there and retake it, but I was too tired (how long can you walk, stop, take a picture, walk, stop, snap..)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trucizna007
50,I loved it!!! Many Hollywood stars in just one museum!,I had a lot of fun visiting this museum. The was figures look so similar to the stars and so real! I had a lot of fun taking lots of pictures. I went there by myself and many other tourists help you with taking pictures. A-W-E-S-O-M-E!!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnaM479
50,Very Interactive!,"My daughter loves to go to the wax museums so we have been in San Francisco, New York and now Hollywood. This one was by far the best. They had lots of props so you can really get into posing with the stars!! It was my 71 year old mom's first time & she totally enjoyed herself!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NorthDakotaBound
40,All the Stars in one place on the Boulivard!,"Situated on Hollywood Blvd it is so close and handy to all the other attractions. A fair price and a good way to spend an afternoon. Some are so lifelike. I would rate it the 2 nd best Madame Tussauds. London win hands down in every way but Hollywood is way bigger than the Hong Kong Madame Tussauds. I Liked the Obama scene, very clever.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KerryC13
50,Best Attraction In LA,This place was AWESOME. You can get up close to the wax figures and take lots of pictures. The price was great because we found a coupon online which cut the price in half.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheTruthReviewer59
50,"""Loved it""",Plenty of great photo opportunities with your favorite wax stars. Very interesting to see the actual size ( they are true to life) of actors you see on screen. Very much enjoyed this attraction and definitely recommend it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pickyPatr0n
50,Camera Magic,"We found a coupon in the airline magazine for entry into the wax museum, but our grandchildren had this listed in our top destinations. The attraction was very well organized, even standing in the line with many international tourists. It was 3 floors of fantastic fun for two teenagers. We snapped crazy photos with our favorite stars. They even provide hats and various costumes to put you into the scene. It was great fun, and we agreed the best thing in Hollywood. Be sure to go to Madame Tussauds, even without a coupon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaryV511
30,Cheesy but fun!,"Some of the figures are really good, but some are pretty bad. It's fun with kids and teens though. It's pricey- definitely get coupons or the go Hollywood pass. Don't forget your camera!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mominct24
40,Fun Experience,"I have been to three of the Madame Tussaud's Wax Museums, New York, Las Vegas, and LA. LA was far superior to the one in Vegas. It's such a fun place to go, especially with your friends or family. It's a chance to take a bunch of silly pictures with your favorite actors. Don't pay for the tickets there though. There are lots of places to get discounts!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bubby2me
40,"Good display, easy location.",Visited Madame Tussauds in August 2013. Good display of stars on view. Can take photos with all and it was not too busy inside as they give a minute or so break between people going inside. Bit pricy for the length of time inside but that is to be expected. Overall not a bad display and worth seeing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Steve_4162
40,pretty good,I visited today and thought some of wax replicas were pretty good. Others didn't look like the people. I thought it was overpriced. If you are into the stars you will enjoy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andreaplace49022
40,Unbelievably realistic + Teens loved it,"Surreal to be face to face with the stars--they look so real, it was amazing! My kids 6-17yrs loved it, they took photos with all their favorites. I was surprised how small many of the stars actually are. If you are going to battle the crowds down the star walk of fame and Grauman's Chinese Theater then you must visit Madame Tussauds it's pretty awesome.[Warning don't be fooled by going to the other Hollywood wax museum totally fake/poorly done down the street]PS. You can get $5 off coupons near the museum by street venders handing out fliers. Also at least for now you can get tickets for only $15 following this link (copy into browser) buy and print tickets:http://www.retailmenot.com/out/4908792",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FlynnDMD
50,Better than we expected,We expected a cheesy wax place. Wow were we impressed and surprised.We got our tickets from our tickets at work web site. They have 30 percent off. And you just print the tickets.Great location if you are checking out Hollywood.We toured about 90 minutes. We took a boatload of photos. Most wax figures were off familiar stars and were very life like.You can take pictures. You can touch and put your arm around them. Just do not touch the face.The entire body is life size so you get to see the height of the star as well.Only one president and that was Obama at a presidential desk.This place has handicap access and is a few yards from a parking garage.You will be impressed. Be sure to bring your best camera.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PH-Travel-Lovers
20,Do not waste your money,"The tickets to this attraction were offered to us for free when we purchased the Hop On Hop Off bus tour of Los Angeles, so we used them. Do not waste you money! There are few wax replicas of movie actors scattered on three different floors and some of them are hard to identify such as Julia Roberts and Jennifer Lopez, they do not look like them. Others were easy to identify, but I found it to be minimal show for the original price.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/105giselas
50,Family affair with the celebrities,This was absolutely the most fun we have all had together. This museum is definitely worth the money and time. It took us about an hour or more to go thru it. The figures look so real...and YES you can touch them..just not their face and hair. They actually look alive if you ask me. Very exciting to see all the hard work that it took to create them.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Michellebenetti
40,They won't even speak to you ..rude,It was a fun way to spend an hour or so .There were 4 of us .It was a fun way to spend over a $ 100 and interact with what turned out to be very rude celebrities .Sure they would pose with you and for you .Good luck getting an autograph ....frustrating .It was fun .You should go .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tomchuck19
40,Fun,"What a fun way for the kids to experience taking pictures with ""stars"" in Hollywood! Wishing it was more to see, but enjoyed the few that was available for viewing! Overpriced, but the kids enjoyed it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mskris04
40,So much promise,"First, let me say, my 16 year old daughter ranked this at the top of her mini-vacation experience to Hollywood and Beverly Hills. Everyone has $5 off coupons, for best price, do not buy from hotel. So many vendors, so many deal options. We decided to go away from starlight packages and did our own adhoc package (liked Rocking Hollywood Tours! Good value). Back to the museum = three floor experience was really good, only a couple of the real life wax figures was a disapointment, Justin Beiber's really did not look good at all or how we imagine him. We were amazed at how tall some are (Obama is really tall). Disapointed that Lance Armstrong is still in there and wondering where some of our favorites (Drew B, Sandra B, Ted Williams, Babe Ruth, Brett Favre, etc...) Just wish there was more. What was there was fun taking pics and dressing the parts. Like Jack Nicholson on a park bench for best pictures. Maybe we will try the other wax museum if we get back to compare. But for frst timers, I would definintely come here as part of your first experience to Hollywood. Parking is convenient if your turn right at the corner ($10 valet for all day) this is centrally located and next to The Chinese Theatre and the main hub of this strip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lost_bobcat
40,"Interesting, but expensive","This was fun, but it was expensive. If you're on a budget, you can skip this one and not miss too much. If you've never been to a wax museum and want to go, then I would recommend this place to visit one time. It is good in the quality of the wax figures. They look very realistic. They are posed in such a way that visitors can take pictures easily, which is fun. I thought the experience was a bit short, though, especially for what we paid.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cool_teacher590
40,Go-- with a coupon,"I wasn't really sure what to expect. My kids were not thrilled with the idea of going and seemed ""bored"" for the first third of the museum... and then they got it. Once they caught on to the idea that they could pose with the figures and get in the scenes, then they started to enjoy it.They didn't recognize many of the figures... but the funny thing is they gravitated to the scenes featuring the old Hollywood Legends (John Wayne, Charlie Chaplin, Hitchcock).They would have gotten more out of it had they been a little older. However, it does make me curious to see the location in Washington, DC with historic figures such as George Washington, Ben Franklin, etc.We were inside a little less than 90-minutes and raced back to our car. Parking at the Hollywood and Highland center ended up being almost nothing after getting our ticket validated at the ""information desk"" near the front door of the Hollywood and Highland/Dolby entrance.I would not call this a ""tourist trap."" It was fun-- but I would certainly recommend finding a discount.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/formeryogi
50,"A Little Wax, A Lot of Fun","My 13 year old wanted to see this museum, so I only agreed because of our LA pass, BUT, she was so taken by the exhibits that we had a great time. Museum features both current and well known past performers in various poses begging to be part of your photo. At the Charlie Chaplin figure, the museum supplies hats and canes. ..Arrive early, museum opens at 9 a.mTeens love thus place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/metoread2
50,great,"Me and my son aged 11 love going to the wax museum. The museum has lot of celebrities and they look real. The tour takes around 1 to 1,5 hours depending on how many visitors and how many pictures you are going to take inside the museum.It is placed right next to the Hard Rock Cafe and the Dolby Center. Lots of people walking round on the outside. When we were visiting in the beginning of July there was lots of people on the outside trying to sell you CDs and asking you to take pictures along with different ""superheroes"". Beware that these ask for a donation after you have received your cd or taken your photo.All in all we had a great visit to the was museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LarsHA_12
40,Beware of the people in costumes outside and those selling CDs,"Ok, first the pros -This wax museum was one of the best I have been to. Models are very lifelike and you can get some really fun pictures. The cost was minimal since I bought the GoLa card which is an excellent deal if you are doing multiple attractions. The museum was not crowded at all, which was nice since everything else in LA seemed to be packed in the summer.The Cons - Having to go through a sea of weird costumed people outside who will offer to take pictures with tourists and then ask for $20 per pic. Also beware of the pushy salesmen with CD's. They act like they are giving away Cd samples, and then pressure you to give them $10 for a demo. So if someone ask you if you would like a photo or a cd, JUST SAY NO! I wish I would have read the reviews first.So if you are going to Madame Tussauds or Dolby or the walk of fame, walk past these pushy salespeople. They will pressure you to spend all the cash in your wallet and put a damper on your vacation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jenras
40,Neat.....but coupon worthy,"First of all... road work=really bad traffic. $10 public parking under museum is by valet but not signed so.still ten bucks. The guys in costume outside of museum will expect money for photos so be ready. Inside not overly crowded as it seems they stop each group to tell the rules/facts. While the specimens? Models? Figures? Were so amazingly lifelike I did not know them all, but then again I wouldn't. Lots of stars from classics, even modern classics. Lots of props for fun photos. If you live somewhere you don't have a wax museum and you are a movie/music buff then come, it will be cool. If you live in SoCal, you go too, at least once for the experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/plmok
30,Not worth the money,On the day we visited it was $5 off. This made the price almost $23/person. The figures are very lifelike and it is almost creepy. I have nothing negative to say about the attraction it is fun taking pictures with the celebrities. I just don't think it was worth the price.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RW1963
50,Wow! Not your typical tourist trap.,"I always wrote off Madame Tussauds until enough people told me it was actually good. I'm so glad we finally went - the Hollywood museum is outstanding. The quality of some of these statues, like Robin Williams, Bruce Willis, and even Snoop Dogg are so real that you expect them to come alive to prank you. The less impressive ones (poor Julia Roberts) are only a testament to how good the artists are at their peak. The best part of this museum is that you're encouraged to have hands-on pictures, to the point where they even provide props, such as a sword to pose with next to Uma Thurman in the Kill Bill set. We had way more fun than we anticipated.Only one caveat: we noticed that people who bought tickets in advance couldn't skip the line at all. There was no benefit other than a discount. In our hotel they had a $5 discount which I think was even better than the prepaid price. Just be aware of this that prepaid tickets skip no line at all - but to be fair, the wait was minimal so prepaying is not much of a benefit anyways.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/puablo
40,Great one time. Top level kids knew who some of the stars are,"Top level were current stars. Further down more stars older generation would know. Some cool interaction with kill bill star, president obama, grease star and iron man.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Denverperson
40,As close to some stars as you may get!,"My daughter and I visited the wax museum on a whim. I tried to buy advance tickets by phone, to save 20%, but the only option was to print at home. We went none the less and had a fun time! You can take as many pictures as you want. You can touch and pose with the statues as long as you don't touch the face or hair. There are a lot of classic movie stars that younger visitors may not know, but enough new stars in both acting and music to make for an entertaining visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/laura_sunshine
40,Fun,"Compared to other Madame Tussaud's this is the best I have been to. Most of the wax figures are very life like and some of them have props so you can dress up. The wax hand making is cool and Monica working in this area was fantastic, unlike the photographers located around the place who seemed unfriendly and mostly uninterested.If you use star tours hop on, hop off bus tours you get a free entry ticket.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sandras23
40,"Fun, great photos",I went online in advance and was able to book tickets at $15 per person. The visit was worth that but I wouldn't pay more.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W6787ZAsallym
50,Always a good time,"It's like going to a Hollywood party and rubbing elbows with all the stars, past and present. If you love Old Hollywood, you'll have a great time at Madame Tussaud's. If you are into today's stars, you will also have a great time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LoriDunhamWilliams
50,Madame Tussauds,"It was great! Many of the figures looked very real, and we had fun posing with them!! This is the first wax museum I have been to that let you get up close and personal with the exhibits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dpn2music
50,Fun museum,"Madame Tussauds was a very good museum. some of the figures are Marilyn Monroe, Elvis, Denzel Washington, and Barack Obama. It is a bit pricey but you can search for many coupons on the Internet. It is very good for kids as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/723RyanC
40,Fun diversion,"This is a fun way to spend an hour or so. Went with the teenage son and he especially enjoyed the sports figures and the action/cartoon ones. Fun to take lots of pics there. The statues are quite life like and several of them have props you can use (e.g., a top hat and cane next to Charlie Chaplin) to make your photos better. Buy your tickets online first to save a couple bucks and skip the line when you arrive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KatieBToronto
50,Great Hollywood stop,"We had coupons for 50% off so we thought we would stop by, having never gone to a wax museum before. We were pleasantly surprised. There are 3 floors to explore at your leisure - take all the photos you want. My family loved using the props and recreating scenes. We had a blast and it was one of the highlights of our trip to Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KentuckyOnthego
40,Wax Museum,"This is the only wax museum you should go, the rest in front of MacDonald do not have updated celebrities..so don bother going.It is quite interactive, good for those who love cam-whoring..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WangY445
40,Must see attraction when in Hollywood,"Even though I live near the Hollywood area, I have never been to Madame Tussauds. Until I got a family season pass through a Groupon special.In June 2013 my family decide to visit the attraction, and we all really enjoyed it.They have wax figures set up in such a way that you can pose with them. Some of the figures even have props that you can put on/wear to enhance your photo.The don't mind if you touch the figures, just not the faces.You can tour the figures at your own pace, stay as long as you like, and take as many photos as you like.If you are visiting the Los Angeles/Hollywood area on vacation, this attraction is worth a visit.I would recommend this attraction to all of my family and friends.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SNAFU23
40,Nice chance to be silly!,"Although it is a little pricey for what you're seeing, it was a great experience inside! It was nice to be able to pose with the statues and be silly. It was exciting to see the look-a-like wax figures of a lot of your favorite stars and all the different set-ups throughout the 3-level exhibition. Definitely search for deals online and book in advance, because otherwise you will be charged a lot more if you just pay at the door.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DBernard1029
20,Ohhh why did I spend my money here????,"Not worth it. A small presentation, not worth the full price or even the price with the 50% discount (you can get it in many magazines).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dado_de_Castro
40,Fun time at the Wax Museum,"We enjoyed the three floors of was figures and being able to take photos with them by sitting next to them, putting on costumes, etc..., Everyone in the family had a great time! Do not pay door prices. Book online and search for discounts. We saved half of the door price by doing this.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/5MaryR
20,Just Okay,"The Hollywood museum is not nearly as big as the NYC location. There are many, many more statues in NYC.My complaint, and the reason for the 2 stars, is that I specifically asked about the Hugh Jackman Wolverine statue when I purchased the tickets on my way in. I was not told at that point that the statue had been removed due to damage.When the ""tour"" was done (took less than an hour), you are exited through the gift shop. I had to find an employee and when I asked about the missing statue, I was told that it was taken down.I believe since I asked about that one at the entrance, I should have been told.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2GirlsTrip
50,Total Fun!,"Worth a visit, tonnes of fun to visit and get photos with so many famous people-and because they are wax they won't ask you for a tip, unlike the star impersonator's out on Hollywood Boulevard! Great place to go see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PetinaK
30,Madame Tussaud's,Having seen madam Tussaud's in London I expected a lot. The wax statues were great as usual however I was disappointed with the number of them and expected more for the cost,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/469JasonW
50,Loved it!,"We enjoyed taking pics,very real looking.Had fun seeing all the stars and learning the facts of how long they take to make.It was my very first time going and I look forward to coming back sometime in the future.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MerryGee88
50,Must see when visiting Hollywood,"We really enjoyed Madame Tussauds. Loved taking photos with all the celebs, and being to able dress up or sit with them, get up close. It is a great attraction.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AliBla
40,Actually Fun and not too crowded,"Been to a couple of these including the one in NY and this was pretty good - didn't feel as big, but did have lots of Hollywood celebs and neat stuff to pose with. Though I haven't seen the photos yet. Went on a Sunday afternoon and there were definitely people around - but got to pose with the figures almost immediately and no queue to get in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JnVSydney
50,This place was great fun!,We had a great time at Madame Tussauds Hollywood. I have been to several wax museums but this is the first where could walk right up to the figure and even touch them - we were told not to touch their heads.... We got great shots with the stars that looked so real people hardly believed they were wax. They even provide props for you to wear in the pictures. I highly recommend this attraction... it is in the heart of the Walk of Fame so it is two for one.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bfuqua
40,This was a pretty good place,There were several waxed figures that did look real. I would recommend going. You are able to take lots of photos with the figures as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ErickS15
50,So life like and you can touch them,"They looked so real and the best thing was you can go right up to them and touch them, place your arms around them and take unlimited photos with your stars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vaniglio
50,Worth the Visit,I really liked Madame Tussauds. I was shocked at how real most of the Wax figures looked. It was clean and spread out. Theres props at alot of the statues so you can interact and get some great pics. This was on our LA go card but I would have visited it anyway.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/716lynnb
30,Decent,"This attraction was decent. I was not as impressed as what most people are. If the wax statues are an accurate depiction of the ""stars"" then I'm really surprised at how small most of the people on tv and in movies are. I'm 5'3"" and I was like a giant beside Jennifer Anniston! There is a lot of congestion in that area as it is right beside the Chinese Theater.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarahd309
40,Worth the Visit,"We had not been to a Madame Tussauds so a must do once and we really enjoyed the experience. Well laid out, plenty of room, great displays. Done it now !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FIZZYS
40,Good attraction to visit,"I was disappointed that most of the stars I expected to see weren't there but I am still giving the museum a high rating because it was a nice attraction to go see. Very clean. If you want the biggest bang for your buck, get the Hollywood City Pass that way you can see 4 attractions in 9 days.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tdantz
50,Great figures - just as good as London's,"Having previously visited Mme Tussaud's in London, the wax museum on Hollywood Boulevard compared extremely well.Pros- the wax figures are, for the most part, quite realistic- they are set out in themed rooms eg. Tiger Woods on a putting green, Tom Hanks as Forrest Gump, William Shatner on the bridge of the Enterprise, President Obama in the Oval Office etc.- you can take photos and video- you can get shots without people in them (if you are a little patient)- there is an iPhone app available- it is easy to find (next to Grauman's Chinese Theatre)Cons- some figures are a little less realisticTips- some other Hollywood tours (eg Starline Homes of the Stars) offer entry to Mme Tussaud's as a free extra- take photos WITHOUT flash. Flash makes the figures look much less lifelike.Have fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Roddlez
50,Great Time,We had a great time taking pictures with the various wax figures. The pictures we took turned out so convincing that it looked like we actually were with the different celebrities. The resemblance of the wax figures to the real person was amazing. There were $5 off flyers that were being handed out in front of Grauman's Chinese Theatre.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/18MikeS18
50,Fabulous,Fabulous .. Very true to life on all the stars. We had an amazing time having photos with all the famous people. Everyone had a photo an bought some great memorabilia in the souvenir shop.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/laci0303
50,Flock of celebrities,"Awesome place to celebrity sightsee. What tripped me out the most was exiting the elevator..completely off guard. Loved it!It's a bit freaky at first because the figures look so darn real. I like how they had the celebrities in their elements. (ie Kobe Bryant w/ a basketball hoop, Tiger Woods putting, Spiderman on the ceiling, etc)I was a disappointed in Robert Downey's Iron Man figure because the lighting for the area is too dark for photos, but the set itself is great.Make sure your camera's are fully charged and take lots of photos. It is a tourist attraction, but I'm a local and I still enjoyed it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kisssmee
40,Great Fun,We spent a fab afternoon visiting Madame Tussaurds and posing with Hollywood superstars both past and present. Lots of great photos for the holiday album - we thoroughly enjoyed our visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrMrsHill
40,Stupid fun,"I will argue that this is an LA must; incredibly tourist-y, but it's definitely the cream of the crop in terms of ""museums"" on Hollywood Blvd. (e.g. Ripley's, World Records, Hollywood Wax Museum). And, at the end of the day, who doesn't want to stand next to Beyonce and/or the Terminator?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/966JoannaM
40,"Go ahead, hug a (wax) celebrity!","I was only marginally curious about visiting Madame Tussauds... not enough to go on my own, but I did cave when a friend insisted it was on her ""must do"" list. Turns out... it's a pretty good time. You're allowed to take pictures with all of the figures - just no touching the faces or hair. There's a lot of opportunity for hilarity if you're creative with your poses.Some of the wax figures are AMAZING - to the point that they'll startle you like, ""OMG it's so-and-so"" and others are so downright creepy you have to move away from them because they keep ""looking"" at you. I was surprised that some of the figures are so lifelike and identical to the celebrity, while others you actually need to look at the name plate to determine who you're gazing at.I'd suggest visiting early - right around 10 AM when they open. And park at Hollywood and Highland and walk the few blocks down the Walk of Fame past Grauman's to get there. (Stop in at guest services at H & H and get your parking validated.)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chel-belle
30,Fun!,"We had fun at Madame Tuassauds, there are lots of different wax models from different genres and there is plenty of opportunities to interact and take some fun photos. It probably took us around 1 hour to go through everything as it wasn't very busy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spazwok
50,Fun for the family,"We had a great time at the museum. The figures were so well done, its a real experience. I definitely got a lot of great photos of the kids with their favorite stars like Lady Gaga and Justin Beiber.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MattQ64
50,So much fun,This was a ton of fun to visit. If you are a picture person this would be the place to go. Posing with all the stars that look so real was a blast!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TL8999
40,Life like celebrities,We have been to several MT's and found this one was very life like. There was room to move inside as well which we found the others a little crowded. The difference with this attraction is the they do not offer a ride as the MT's in New York and London did. The London MT's is probably the best.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KelleyD588
50,Enjoyable,This attraction is not cheap. We had Go LA cards so it was included. Didn't really think I would enjoy a wax museum but the figures were so lifelike. Great photo opportunities I would recommend it,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/712christineg
50,Excellent Exhibits,"We had a blast at Madame Tussads Wax Museum! The stars are so life like, that when I sat down by ""Forrest Gump"", my foot barely touched his pants and I had to stop myself from saying ""oh, excuse me"" Several times, I caught myself double checking to make sure they weren't real. We had the best time posing with the stars and taking pictures. At first I didn't want to go because I thought it was for the younger generation, but I was so glad I did. I will definitely visit again if I ever to back to Hollywood and I highly recommend. This is a ""Must See.""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CathyA29
50,"Lots of fun, take lots of pictures, expensive parking","We decided to go to Madame Tussauds wax museum as opposed to The Wax Museum across the street even though this one is a bit more pricey. You can actually find a lot of coupons for 50% off on line, just go to google and put Madame Tussaud hollywood coupons, We got in for 50% off. We went with our 2 kids who were free becuase they were in strollers we had to take elevators, place is wheelchair/stroller friendly.Lots of celebrities: Halle Berry, Jennifer Lopez, Justin Bieber, Denzel Washington, Meryl Streep, Madonna, Whitney Houston, Michael Jackson okay theres way too much for me to list LOLthey're really good, look just like the real thing (i guess, me assuming from watching tv, never seen a celebrity in real life), kid friendly and my kids aged 5 and 3 actually had fun, even though they didnt know who anyone was :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emaya800
50,Fun!,We were given free tickets for purchasing 48 hours on the star line bus and we were so glad we went. It wasn't very big but was loads of fun posing with the stars. Not too crowded it was nice and cool inside. Some of the figures are so realistic you almost expect them to blink and it's quite creepy. This was my first wax museum and i would definitely go to another.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/donna1981xx
30,A good way to spend a couple of hours,"Right on Hollywood Blvd, Madam Tusaauds is right in the middle of everything. Consisting of 3 floors, you get to see a lot of the wax figures who seem pretty life like. My 15 year old niece enjoyed herself immensely. The entry fee is pretty pricey but I was able able to do it because it was a part of my City Pass. It is not a must do, especially if you have been to the other Madam Tussauds but if you have a City Pass or score free entry, then go enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sjsanchez
50,Great way to spend an hour or two.,A great place to visit while in Hollywood. The wax figures are life like and you can take as many photos as you want. The displays are well spaced out and I liked the 'props' you could use for the photos. A great visit. Would recommend.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mzcoast
30,fun and entertaining,"All the figures at the museum are very well placed, except some spaces are narrow, and there may be ppl taking pics and holding up the traffic flow, the one in new york is more spaced out as compared to this one but its got Beyonce, Johnny Depp, and the oval office with Obama, oh and Don Corlione, lots of different celebrities, from sports to glamour. I recommend it. The only con I think is the space",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MEXICANRICHBOY
50,Everything we expected,"This was the highlight of our visit, once you get pass the large number of tourist that surrounds this area and get into the museum, it's wonderful. The wax figures are quite life like and you can take all the pictures you want.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cincysse
50,Madame Tussauds Hollywood Wax Museum,The wax figures look real and there are a large number of celebrities and sports stars featured. I was a little disappointed they did not have Lucille Ball on display. These figures look so real that I took a photo of my wife with Jack Nicholson and posted it on Facebook and our friends thought we really got to meet him. The tour is well worth the money they charge. Hollywood itself is dirty and have nothing but low life druggies and tourists. Your time will be better spent in Beverly Hills.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ORGILL95
30,We had free entry,"It was fine, hardly anything like the one in London.What made it with it for us was our free ruched from the sightseeing tour bus.If you life a few celeb photos this is the place for you.OK, but having seen the London one, I know it can be way better.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ramzoozi
30,Touristy Fun,"I had always wanted to go and am glad that I finally did. Maybe if I were a tourist instead of a local, I would have enjoyed it more. Learning about the process of how they statues are made was fascinating. But it did not rock my world. Worth a visit though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NancyE425
50,So real,We really enjoyed visiting here. The wax figures are very life like. Be sure to bring the camera!! Excellent for the old and the young!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MRSTX
30,quaint,good for the family. lots of walking. pricey and the parking is okay. colorful and original but not a place i would visit often.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/188RobertT
50,Better than I expected,"I wasn't very excited about this attraction since I'd been to a wax museum before, but my2 daughters had never been to one and this is how they chose to spend our last day in LA so I gave in and took them. I was soooo impressed with how much work woes into making the figures life-like. My 12 year old was scared to get too close to the Snoop Dogg figure because she swears she saw him blink!! This is definitely worth a trip if you're in the area, be sure to take a camera....you're allowed to touch the figures and pose with them, there are coupons available, so be sure to find one and use it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aggiegrl
40,First class!,"On this day we took pictures of the fake and real Jim Carrey as the premiere of his new movie ""The Incredible Burt Wonderstone"" happened on the same day we visited! The wax figure of Jim Carrey seemed as energetic as the real one we saw later that evening. In fact, many of the figures seemed so alive that I almost thought they were pretending to be fake. My daughter was shocked that the Simon Cowell figure sitting in a corner was not really him! This was an absolute treat for me and the kids. Well, except for my 6-year old, who didn't really know who most of the celebrities were. He knew of a couple like Jackie Chan and Justin Bieber but I had to explain most of the others to him. Other than that, we had a great time posing for pictures and role-playing. Madame Tussaud's does a wonderful job not only with the lifelike wax figures but the great detailed sets that guests can take pictures with. The place is first class all the way!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/azpinoyinmesa
50,Nice!,"Better than expected. When I read reviews the statues are life-like, I didnt really believe. But some are really life-like! Well worth a visit because lets face it, you're not going to really meet any celebs in LA, so this is the next best thing. :) Great job by the model makers. And now I know how tall the celebs actually are.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/McFaren
40,it was actually quite decent!!!,"wasn't looking forward to this, but we purchased the go card and wanted to do as much as we couldthis museum actually suprised meit wasn't like the other madam tussauds i been tothere was alot more on display and was in different sectionsmy favourite section was the movie comics areaand its interesting the video at the end on how they make the life models!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/babyangel2007
40,One easy way to spot celebrities!!!,"Well if you go to Hollywood and can't find celebrities the hard way, then this is a nice and EASY way to get some happy snaps with your favourite stars!!We took photos with almost every wax figure in the show - the 3 kids were enthralled and very happy. I also managed to snuggle up to Brad Pitt, Daniel Craig and David Beckham... :)There are so many celebrities from every era that it really keeps the whole family happy. As well as Superhero's, action figures, rock stars, pop stars, movie stars - you name it - it's all here.Quite an extensive collection of celebrities, plus there are props for you to wear and some extremely funny poses - you can even get on a camel with Lawrence of Arabia - it's quite hilarious.A really good time - only cost us $25 each and we were here for a few hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Will_not_camp
50,Interesting wax museum,"Nice tour with lots of figures to see. You can take as many pictures as you like, and some even have props for you to wear in your photo. Some of the stars were so lifelike it was creepy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dvyoral
40,I had a hilarious time,"Taking photo's with life like figures was amazing. I had a fun time posing while someone else took the pictures for me. The waxed out figures were very close to the real thing. So much fun. For $10 buck extra in addtion to my Hollywood tour ($45 total), was a great deal. I hope they continue to add more celebrities to the roster.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/divine010
50,Loved it!!,"We got a half off coupon when we walked up to the line so it only cost us about $25, its a laugh and some of the wax models look unbelievably real, its kinda creepy. There's a great layout of the current stars of movies and TV and also older ones from the 30's through to now.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Majellac
50,Great Fun for All!,"The wax figures are excellent, for the most part, very life-like. There are many famous figures to see and as long as you do not touch the face or hair, to ""interact with"". They encourage you to use their props to take pictures, which adds to the fun. Well worth the trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dlelonek
40,Be your own paparazzi,"After visiting the Sydney Madame Toussards, I was not excited to go to this one, but it was great. Loads of 'celebs', great set up, everyone got involved and had fun.After we had left, my daughter went into the adjoining Starbucks to change the baby, and after being horrified at the state of the facility, grabbed him half undressed in one arm, bag in the other and ran back in to ask if she could be helped out. A staff member escorted her to the toilets, and waited for her, continually asking if she needed help. My daughter said the toilets were impeccable and was very grateful for the willingness of the staff member in helping her out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ronni68
50,Madame Tussauds Hollywood - the best of the Madame Tussauds,"I've visited MT in Vegas, London, Chicago and now LA. The LA version is my favorite. New exhibits every time you go. Lots of fun stuff to do in and around it as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/asmichalik
40,Always A Fun Time,"My friend and I love going to wax museums. I've been to the Madame Tussauds in Vegas so I was really excited to go to the one in Hollywood! Some of the figures look exactly like the celebs and others don't, but I love how you can interact w/them, just as long as you don't touch the face or hair! It's always a great time! Can't wait to check out the ones in DC and NYC! We had a $5 off coupon so it was only $20.95, pretty cheap for LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kbphotography85
40,Great for pop culture lovers!,"Most figures are insanely lifelike! A few are in need of being retired. I was quite impressed by how interactive this place was. The sculptures are free-standing, not behind glass, so they make for great photo opportunities. There are also props available to enhance the experience and make it a little more fun. I wouldn't go out of my way to visit this place if I was on a tight schedule, but it's a good place if you have an hour or two to kill.It is also the only wax museum on Hollywood Boulevard worth visiting. The other two options are no where near as lifelike or as fun as this. Don't waste your time with anything else.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanielleP638
40,Very real looking,Was skeptical to pay $25 to see this but was surprised. About 90% of them look sooo real kind of creepy! Made for some good pics.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JMRow
40,How fun is this place!?,"This is the only wax museum I have been to, so not sure how on par it is with others, especially other Madame Tussauds, however we have a blast on our visit! The wax figures were so life like, with many stars from all different entertainment and sports genres available for viewing and posing. My husband especially loved the Star Trek figures, with my favourites being Sarah Michelle Gellar (as Buffy) and ET (you can even get on the bike with him). Definitely recommended and the guide book is also great vaue at $6.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cutieb00tie
40,So lifelike.,"Have visited Madame Tussauds in London 3 yrs ago, and this compares favourable. I enjoyed that many of them are interactive with props for you to use for your photos. Quite astounded how short some of the actors are. A worthwhile visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bucketlist500
50,Fantastic if you love movies! A lot of fun!,"First, I will start by saying that the realism of the wax replicas was insanely good! I had to just take a few closeups because the detail of the actors was impeccable. All of the actors are also accessible and from many film eras - the best part is taking your pictures with your favorite actors in many scenes with some of the provided props to enhance the experience. My wife and I had a blast striking poses and just acting like fools in some of the pictures we took. We've seen almost all the movies that involved the replicas on display so we had a great appreciation for this museum and enjoyed it immensely. There were also sports heroes as well - I wonder how long Lance Armstrong will last there ;). If you are not a movie buff, you may not enjoy it as much but if you are, it's impossible to not to have fun!Tip: Order online to get a few bucks off or get a coupon from a hotel or shop to get a $5 off and up to 6 people can use it - these coupons are hanging around everywhere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NewEnglandTraveler11
30,Worth a visit,"This is a good museum, with plenty of characters to see. However it is so busy, at most times of day. I actually much preferred the Hollywood Wax Museum just down the street.The highlight of this museum is sitting at a desk with Barack Obama to get your photo taken - what a hoot!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RhiRa
30,If you've got an hour to spare...,"We had purchased 48h Hop on Hop off passes and were able to get two free entries to Madame Tussaud.Some wax statues looked very realistic, like Snoop Dog, Marlene Dietrich, a young Elvis, Tom Hanks as Forrest Gump. They did however make Britney Spears look like she was high on prescription drugs. Audrey Hepburn got multiple eye lifts during the figure-making process. The Justin Bieber figure looks like a hot lesbian.Obviously the statues are made of wax, but while some bare a striking resemblance to the stars (skin, teeth and hair wise), others are extra shiny like they were dipped in Crisco.It was entertaining and funny. But I'm glad we didn't pay for the tickets.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lemons_lavender
40,You can snuggle up for pictures with your favourite celebrities!,We purchased the Hollywood City Pass and went in here. It was really cool being able to touch all of the mannequins and wear props and be all silly.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SunLovingGurl
40,Definitely worth a look.,This is right on the strip and s great way to spend about an hour.We went through and took LOTS of photos with the wax models and had lots of fun.Tip!- we used a 50% off voucher that we found in one if our tourist magazines but found out at the door that if you mention the voucher but don't have it you'll still get the discount.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/geoffdemanser
40,Photo Fun,"-worth the money, but pre-purchase your tickets online as the lines can be long...with our prepurchase tickets we basically walked right in, saved a 20 - 30 minute wait.- can be a little packed, give yourself at least 2 hours if you want to get in all the fun photos you can take in this place!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KenK641
40,Had a fun time here,"This was a fun experience.. You are allowed to take photos with the Exhibits and actually touch them , were as at most Madame Tussauds exhibits are behind roped off areas. Kids seem to be enjoying this aspect of it as well. We had lots of fun taking photos with all the old hollywood stars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Maryjo0929
50,Loved it!!,"Excellent wax museum tour of all the Hollywood stars. Great tour of Hollywood stars from all eras. Old classic Hollywood stars to all the recent ones. Great sets, narration and costumes. Loved it. A definite must see!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SydneyJetsetter
40,Don't forget to take your camera,"We had no expetations and went here only because we got free tickets from Starline bus tour. But it was great fun. Models look real, some of them very real. You can take pictures with them, strike a pose, be in a museum as long as you want. Be sure you look around for costumes you can use for your photo. TIP: go there around lunch or in the evening, when it's not so crowdy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PetrK46
40,It was fun!,"It was fun and some of the figures are pretty real!! some others are not so real or are getting old, you can see they are falling apart or the clothes are covering scratches.But it was fun after all because there are many ""enhanced experience"" activities, like the museum lending you hats, scarfs and tons of stuff so you can pose for the photos.Be sure to go with some friends so you can take more funny pictures.Even when I like it, no Madame Tussauds museum has been better than the one in London, for me that is the best.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/laurichiz
40,So life like,"Was a lot better than I thought it would be. Very lifelike and in fact a couple of the wax figures actually looked like their eyes were following you. Fantastic cross section of celebrities and if you can't find one of your favorites to have a photo with then there is something wrong with you. The only problem is fighting your way through all the street vendors and scammers out the front, although as long as you tell them, no thanks straight up, they'll leave you alone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SGM5046
50,The best!,"I was able to find a 50% off coupon online before arriving in LA which was excellent, as 4 adult tickets came to only $12.50 each! The museum is strangely laid out over 3-4 floors with the models broken into categories, but once inside it was excellent! Some models looked so lifelike it was amazing while others left you staring at them wondering what the model makers were doing! We only had 1hr to spend in the museum but it was a fantastic 1hr with heaps of fun and laughs taking photos! I loved how they had props such as hats etc next to some models such as Rocky, Charlie Chaplin etc that you could wear and have photos in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RachelAust
30,Waxing,"The staff at the entrance were less than friendly when we arrived, in fact it seemed like we had interrupted their conversation. Once in some of the likeness are really amazing like Elvis, Morgan Freeman and yet some are not quite there like Leonard Di Capro. What did get annoying was people jumping into your photo or jumping the line to get their photo.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MsAlleycatz
50,Worth to see,"It's quite pricey, but you can find many discounts in leaflets, which you can find in hotels, we saved 50% this way. There are really cool wax figures inside, most of them look like real, you can touch them and have a photo everywhere. There are even some accesories available (like Charlie Chaplin's hat and his stick next to his wax figure), which makes your photos more funny. There's also short exhibition presenting how wax figures are made and how it is complicated and time consuming. And you can see most of the famous Hollywood stars, we figured out most of them are really short :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PrzemyslawS402
50,"Included in our Go LA cards, otherwise pricey, lots of fun!, photo ops",Fun experience. Wouldn't pay the high admission if not in our go la card. Great photo ops all through. Had a good time!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jmjesq
50,EXCELLENT!,"We went to this & found it to be interesting!The wax figures are out for you to see,touch & have your picture taken with: but the people that work there say you shouldn't touch the wax figures wigs for they can be ruined easily.Beware of they're gift shop for I've never seen a place before that doesn't have prices on their items.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnp366
50,with kids,"liked how life like the figures were, liked the props to take pictures with.. liked the variety of figures.. liked how close it was to walk to other activities",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrsp246
40,It is just what you would think,"It was great to see the wax figures, but thats all it is. My kids thought it was a lot better that I did. It was fun to see, but all the same. They had a few photo op stops, and they sold the pictures at the end of the tour when you had to walk through the gift shop to leave.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stuartt144
50,Excellent!!!!!,"Awesome! we visited Madame Tussauds in March 2011 and is one of the most interesting places in Hollywood!The figures look very real, sometimes even getting scary they look like live!With any character you can be photographed. To avoid the wax shine, try to photograph without flash, and then the photo with a wax figure museum will look real!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OOAK-30
30,Go if it's included...or if you've never been,"Good touristy fun. Since the ticket was included with our Starline tour, we decided to check it out. I had never been to a wax museum although I've been meaning to check out the one in NYC.The museum has a ton of different people represented from Beyonce to Justin Timberlake to Kobe Bryant. Each is shown in their ""world"" so Kobe is on the basketball court. I found most of the figures to be realistic but there were some that I didn't think looked very good.They let you/encourage you to take pictures with the models so come prepared with a fully charged camera battery. Some of the photo areas have props which is nice.  It's great for photo opps!I'm only giving Madame Tussand's 3 stars instead of 5 because of the price and length of the museum. Regular price is $25 which is way, way, way too steep. The museum is good but short-we were in a rush and did it in 30 mins.  Even not in a rush, I think the museum could be done in about an hour to an hour and a half.Go once to say you've gone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanaJ947
40,Take Your Time & Have Fun With It,"Take your time going through the ""look alikes"". Had fun taking pictures and seeing them in ""real life-like"" situations. It's funny how we think they are all bigger than life (tall, gorgeous etc) but some are actually very small petite folks. Everything here it to scale and the ""how-it's made"" studio is really interesting. Take your time - I'd say allow at least 2 hours to really see it all and have fun with the life-like stars. Definitely recommend it for a visit. Good for teenagers too. Do look for discounts as they are available. We've done other wax museums close by with similar name and they weren't nearly as good as this one. Bring your imagination and have fun with it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CRM433
50,Excellent place if you are new to wax statues,"I have visited Los Angeles in the first week of Nov - 2012 and the experience is great as this is the first time i was in Hollywood and to Madame Tussauds. On the day of visit, we were greeted by OBAMA but could't take a picture as he won the elections he is on his way to go around the streets of hollywood. It take 1 1/2 to 2 hrs to complete all the attractions on a normal day if you click at most of the statues. Plan it on Weekdays as it gives you a good time to get space to capture pictures and Hollywood streets are too crowded on Weekends. I also bought soverniers from adjacent store which sells everything for $5 - very reasonable. Dont forget to click pictures outside Madame Tussauds and on walk of fame and chinese theatre etc..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RajeshR238
20,Just OK!,"It is my first and last wax museum.Ok, I knew that I would see some persons, take some ""tourist"" pictures, this and that. But the museum is small and I paid too much to few entertainment.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mauro_Manzano
30,Ok,"We visited Madame Tussauds as it was included in our Go Los Angeles cards, having been to the ones in New York and London i have to say this one is only average in comparison, it doesn't take long to get round the whole place, some of the models look like the celebrities but others dont look anything like who they are meant to be. I would not have paid to go into here if it was not included with the card. I recommend visiting the Madame Tussards in London, it is by far the best one i have been to.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/outandaboutwithliz
50,Had such a fun time with pictures to show it!,"My cousin and I recently spent an entire afternoon at Madam Tussauds in Hollywood and it was AWESOME! When you get off the elevator you feel like you're the star! They have a few that need improvement (no wonder Ryan Seacrest is in the corner hidiing) It was such a great mix of old stars, new stars, sports stars, just a fun time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JMUDuke
40,Pre teen girls loved it.,"We visited with pre teen girls and they loved getting there pictures taken ""with the stars"". We visited both the Hollywood Wax Museum and Madame Tussauds Wax museum. In Madame Tussauds Wax museum the characters are more realistic, more current characters, and just more of them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LibLady
50,Perfect,"They really looks like the real actors... my favorites were Jim Carrey, Madonna, Steven Spilberg and Morgan Freeman. The couple Pitt-Jolie are too glossy, and JB is even worst than live.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EriksonSeal
40,Way better than hollywood wax museum!,"If you are going to go to a wax museum...go to Madame Tussaunds. They have a standard, unlike Ripley's hollywood wax museum. The Ripley's attraction's wax figures look horrible and not even close to the stars or obviously look fake. The one's in Tussaund's look so real and life like. It is a fun place and layed out great. Even on a busy day, we didn't have to wait on people very much and nobody was in the way of our pictures. Great price value too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SkylyrBallew
30,Average,"Went because it was on my GoLA card, dunno if I'd have gone if it hadn't been having been to the one in New York a few years ago. Most of the wax works the same, some with varying quality and likenesses.If you haven't been to a Madame Tussauds - or haven't been for a while - it may be worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SMTID
40,What Fun!,"We've been to a few Madame Tussauds and this one was definitely fun! Several of the displays offered ""props"" to use to put you ""in the picture"" with the star you were standing with. Top Hats, cowboy hats, Charlie Chapman cane, etc......I made use of all I could find! I've never seen that at the other Madame Tussauds I've been to.Definitely recommend this.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lissy0717
20,NO,Total rip off. The wax figures are terrible. They look nothing like the celebrity. Very dissapointing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ladinks
30,"if you've been to one wax museum, you've been to them all","Nothing special about this one, in my opinion. But I had already been to the one in San Francisco. Perhaps if this had been my first one, I would have liked it more. It is definitely amazing what they do with wax, but since they are a chain, it kind of takes the specialness out of it for me. But if you have never been to one, then you would probably like it. And it's a good location on Hollywood Blvd.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L2Connelly
40,So much fun and great to get out of the heat for a while!,"We had booked the 48 hour starline hop on/hop off bus tour and got entrance to Madame Tussauds included for free. We probably wouldn't have bothered otherwise, but we were so glad we did. It was great, so much fun (for children and adults) and would definately recommend a visit. Its also in a great location, right next to the Chinese theatre.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AliWatford
40,First timer visit,"They do an amazing job, but as I walked around it was hard to belive that these where the actual size of the real people. I could not belive how small most of them where. I am a big guy, so I am used to people being smaller than me, but these just did not seem possible, so many small. I had to look it up once back to my hotel to see if the sizes were correct. Turns out they are.It would have helped knowing that going in, Perhaps they have it written somewhere, but I didn't see it anywhere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Markson36
40,Lots of fun and pictures,"We had no intention to go but as it was included free as part of our hop on and off ticket we gave it a go and were pleasantly surprised. It's lots of fun taking pictures and our 7 year old loved all the props and took endless pictures , we ended up spending more time than originally intended and it was fun",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/angieMelbourne
40,Overall a good time,"The figures that were there were excellent. And the fact that you could get right next to them and take pictures was great. And some scenes had props or you could sit down like you were in the scene with the figure. I just thought there would be more figures though. Definitely a must-do, but I think once wad probably enough.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoeB255
40,Lots of Hollywood Figures,"I've been to most of the Madame Tussaud's museums. Each show many figures for their specific area of the world, and Hollywood is no exception. Had a great time taking my photos with many of the Hollywood icons... always enjoy Madame Tussaud's!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vakayplannerPa
30,slightly disappointed,I visited Madame Tussauds on a trip to LA. I was very impressed with the quality of the wax figures. A large majority were very life like. 1 or 2 looked very fake. I was disappointed in the amount of figures tho. I would have liked it if the amount of figures was at least double what they currently have,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GoldenGuinea
50,Amazing fun!,Great place to visit. $25 each for an adult. Fantastic place to get photos of all your favorite stars. They look so real. The place is very clean and tidy. You can get professional photos on the way through as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Coconut_dog
40,Very cool!,"I'd never been to a Madame Tussauds before, but was well pleased to finally visit one. Though the price of admission is a little on the steep side, the wax figures are amazing and it really is a lot of fun, almost verging on creepy, to walk through and see all these ridiculously life like celebrity figures standing around.Snoop Dogg for me was the standout!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PDMarch
40,Good and Scary..,"Like some previous reviews stated, the place is small and a bit overpriced.Make sure you get some discount coupons on stores nearby.Some ""statues"" are so lifelike that you actually expect them to move...Good activity for an hour or so.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrazilianDoode
40,Small building but a lot of fun,"We got free tickets from Starline Tours. I would probably never pay to get into one of these wax museum attractions, especially looking at the prices on the board to enter. But we went and had fun. My wife loved taking alot of pictures with the ""Stars"". Some of the newer wax sculptures are extremely realistic, my wife questioned if even one was an actor just standing there. Good to go once to check out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jstatik
40,Go if you're there,"Fun. We had the City Pass, so the cost was fine for us, but without the pass this wouldn't have been worth admission. It was much smaller than I thought, but it was fun and the figures were well crafted.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Scott2919
30,small but fun,the building only a 3 floors and every floor is really small just few of celebrities figures I don't say it's boring it's absolutely fun no doubt but not what I expected it's a really small place and not that much things to see,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nnnnnnnn1919
40,Fun (But Overpriced) Attraction,"My family of three (including my 10-year-old son) really enjoyed ourselves and were surprised that we were able to stand alongside of and even touch the figures (except for the heads). The reproductions are high quality, so it's a little strange at first. Standing face-to-face with Hannibal Lecter is especially scary. At any moment you expect him to come alive--but not that you want him to! The museum was busy but not crowded. It was easy to wander around, take photos, and gawk at the celebrities (past and present), politicians, and sports figures in wax. You're able to get a photo with President Obama in the Oval Office--you can purchase one taken by the official photographer and are also permitted to take your own. An area telling how the models are made was interesting. We visited Madame Tussaud's because it was included in the Los Angeles Go Card. If it hadn't been for that, we definitely wouldn't have spent the $25 per adult and whatever it would have cost for our son. Coupons seem to be readily available, so be sure to take advantage of them. Allow 1-2 hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jsctraveler
50,Surprisingly fun!!,"We only wandered into this as we received free tickets when we did our Hollywood Stars Homes Tour ( less homes - more front gates ). But what fun we had!! Really cool to pose with the stars and we laughed and laughed...Interesting to see how tall or short many celebrities are / were...The detail is all in the faces (don't look too closely at hands or feet). We were pleasantly surprised by how interactive we could be - putting on props, free to touch all the statues (just not the faces!!)...Quite the surprise afternoon!! Highly recommend!!It probably helps that we went on a quiet day and so didn't have to queue or shuffle around or jostle for a photo...Loved it!! Great fun - satisfies the Celebrity curiosity in us all...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gotigers80
40,A fun experience,This wax museum was awesome and a lot of fun! The figures were so life like and you're allowed to hold/hug the figures. This was the best wax museum that I have ever been to. Make sure you look around for a $5 off coupon because they are everywhere.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ianmc99
40,Something different,"We hadn't planned to go to Madame Tussauds but my teenage son really wanted to go. It was a little expensive. The wax figures were awesome! They were very realistic and it was fun to take pictures with some of the figures. I was a little disappointed that there wasn't more ""atmosphere."" The figures were just kind of plopped down in the middle of the rooms...some had tables or chairs near them but no other scenery. Overall, fun to do once but probably too expensive to go back again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scrappermom1011
40,Great fun...be sure to get a coupon!,"We scored a 1/2 price coupon, bringing the price down to $12.50/person, rather than $25... We enjoyed seeing all the celebrities up close; most are really life-like. It's great that guests can take pictures right next to the wax figures. My 18 year old granddaughter really got caught up in the the fun of it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zilphap
40,Larger than Life,"This is a fun place for children and adults alike. The was figures are, indeed, so life-like that you sometimes do a double-take to make sure they aren't real. We had fun taking pictures beside most of the wax figures. They gave you props to use with some of the figures to make it more fun. You can make your own wax hand for $15 and even have it done in a color. The kids and teens really enjoyed that!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/939SandraP
50,Best Wax Museum,This place was great. I had so much looking at the wax figures. They are all so detailed and so realistic it's almost too creepy. I really enjoyed the props that came along with the figures to take pictures. It wasn't too full which I was worried about. I'd love to go back and visit again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/QuellyAnne
50,Hands Down the Best Wax Museum!!,"The realism and quality of the wax figures at Madame Tussaud's cannot be overstated. By far, this is the best wax museum we have ever visited!! Unlike some wax museums where the figures are highly protected behind velvet ropes, Madam Tussaud's allows visitors to interact with the figures for great photos. They encourage visitors not to touch the hair and face of the figures (for obvious reasons), but otherwise, you have surprisingly up-close and personal photo opportunities with every figure in the exhibit. Hint: Search online and find coupon deals with other attractions, such as some of the touring companies. We actually got free passes to Madame Tussaud's by purchasing full price tickets for one of the tours pointing out the homes of the stars in Hollywood Hills and Beverly Hills. It was a great deal!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Brandon_Olive
20,Yawn...,"I could have bought another cocktail at Musso Franks and skipped this...Of course, if this is up your alley, it is well done. Definitely better than the one in London which seemed seedy and run down in comparison. (I got dragged to both)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trrydms
50,Photo-ops galore!,"Only went because it was included in our Go LA pass, but we only had our cellphones to take pics with. We had so much fun we went back again the next day with a better camera to have a real photo session. :) I really enjoyed the classic Hollywood movie section, but they were all pretty awesome.Take a camera and have fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Grw-Whr-U-R-Plntd
40,Enjoyable,We really enjoyed our visit to Madame Tussauds in Hollywood. It was great fun to be able to walk around and get up close the the wax figures! We had no problems with taking photos with everyone and weren't asked to pay extra. The only complaint I would make was that when we arrived there was only one person selling the tickets and there must have been about 50 of us in line waiting! But he was extremely pleasant and friendly - so that took most of the frustration of the wait away :-).,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karenko111
40,Neat,We went through because some of the figures are not in the Las Vegas one. It was pretty much the same thing and not as big. We got a discount so it was only about $20:00 each and worth it to see all the figures. Some of them look so real it is scary. When you look into thier eyes you think they are looking back at you. We had fun and took lots of pictures. It is a good way to spend an hour.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GummyStewart
50,Great fun!!,"We had so much fun taking pictures, it's an up close and personal with the stars you like. probably the closest you'll come to one. There are props to use and 3 floors worth of fun to be had. it's suitable for your visit to Los Angeles, where celebs are a big deal.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rehanahen
50,Fun attraction!,This was such a fun attraction to see while we were staying in Hollywood! It right in the heart of all the Hollywood madness. It was a lot of fun to see all of the wax statues of our favorite celebrities and take pictures with all of them. Make sure to check this place out!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/timdrake42
20,Nothing special,"I would love to say it was awesome but it was just average - we were done in 20 minutes and we have some cool photos (especially the one with spiderman), but still wouldn't pay 25 dollars for it (we had it included in Go Los Angeles pass - best pass ever).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sport_guy_23
30,Disappointing for the price,"My husband and I were pretty excited about going here, we didn't realise there was one in LA.Was not what we expected. When we entered the museum we felt a bit lost, for stairs then floors but the biggest disappointment was the top famous people had photographers there so if you wanted a photo with Obama, you had to pay for it. Not worth the money, will do the Hollywood museum next time which is what we were recommended over this but instead went with our poor judgement.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RosieG229
40,Lots of fun,It is lots of fun at the museum but the figures are too close to one another. The one in Las Vegas is presented much better. Bring your camera and expect to take lots of pics,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LTtracy
50,Great Place,"Loved the celebrities, and the attention to detail, the time and effort made the place well worth the visit",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bigblack416
40,Lots of current celebrities,"Typical Madame Tussaud's with very real wax figures of current celebrities. Last floor shows how they are made. We had been to the one in New York which has twice as many figures so found this one ""short"".",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nevillcanada
50,Fun Time with the Family!,"Probably the most celebrities you will find in one place that let you take unlimited photographs! Haha! Well, the wax museum is what is, if you are interested in seeing the celebrity wax figures these artists have created! You will for sure be guaranteed smile big, laugh hard, and just have fun checking out all the displays. The Lady Gaga figure is amazingly close to real, Madonna looks great, there is a big area for President Obama. Have fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/307JenniferW
40,Fun museum!,"Brought my daughter here for her 12th birthday (to see it). She and her friends had so much fun and it is located in Hollywood, so it is right where all of the action is and people watching.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/305HeatherM
50,Fantastic!,The statues seem so real that I was impress!!! U also get 2 c how they do the status! It's amazing! :D,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LaQueenNo1
50,Lots of fun for young and old!,"We were a group of 7 ranging from 8 to 62 years, and everyone loved it. We took lots of pictures, and really enjoyed it. Would definitely recommend a stop here if you're visiting LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Millerjace
40,Creepy and Chaotic,Very intense as some of the figures feel like they are going to grab you by the neck and find a way to squeeze out ones lifeforce. Hard to take photographs without getting other's in the shot due to the layout of the museum but overall it was something I am glad I have seen but choose not to go again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alohaJOHN88
50,Fantastic fun and great photo ops,"Took my 2 girls, 7 and 12, and they both loved it. I was pleasently suprised that there were stars that each of my girls were excited to see. I was worried about the overall traffic, but once inside everyone was on the same agenda of taking pics with the wax figures. Everyone was polite and waited shortly for their turn to take a pic. The set up was awsome, they had a red carpet area with current stars of music and film, they had an oldie section with stars from the past, and the coolest of all was the superhero section, which my girls loved. We went almost on a fluke and spent nearly 2.5 hours just awestruck at how real the figures were.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kingofthehill81
40,"Great fun, very life like",Has some great models of heaps of different actors. So life like you think they will move any second.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jedmonds86
40,Star Sightings-The Easy Way!,"We had friends from Houston visit, and they wanted to see ""Hollywood"", and am sure they were hoping for a celebrity sighting as well. So, we drove to the Hollywood & Highland complex and saw both the stars on the sidewalk Hollywood Walk of Fame and the wax ""stars"" in the Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum. It was fun, even for us locals, because although on occasion you do see a live celebrity around town, the only sure way to see them up close is to visit their very well-done likenesses at Madame Tussaud's. It was interesting to see how tall they either are or aren't and the displays are set up so that you can stand or pose right next to them and take photos in small diorama settings. The Wax Museum tour took about an hour for the actual tour and we were only in-line approx 15 minutes, having purchased special 1/2 price tickets online that included a fast-pass entry. Museum staff also takes professional photos during the tour, if you are interested in purchasing them, however you are allowed to take your own photos as well. Our guests came away with a taste of the Hollywood experience and although no live celebrities were present, it does feel a bit as if you ""met"" some of them. We also wandered around a bit and saw Grauman's Chinese Theatre signature & hand/footprints courtyard and the street performers dressed as different characters and buskers playing various instruments. It was actually fun for those of us that live in the LA area too, since we don't normally do the tourist type events and venues.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shelli_english
30,Ok,"I've been to the Madam Tussauds in Vegas and this one doesn't even compare. The figures could be better and there isn't really that many to see. We breezed through this in about 20 minutes. I thought it would be better since its the same company but sadly, no.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/03nismochick
40,Great fun!,"Believe it or not, parking on Hollywood Avenue is easier than you think, and my 13 year old LOVED Madame Tussauds -- wanting me to take pictures of him with virtually every character! Order tickets online ahead of time and save money and avoid the line!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JudithA910
50,Great Value,"We thought the entry fee to Madame Tussauds was very reasonable. We managed to spend a couple of hours in here snapping lots of photos and had a ball. The set up was excellent and well thought out. I must admit my expectations were low, but I was pleasantly surprised.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travelbuddy_1987
50,"Family enjoyed the tour, lots of pictures!","We visited the Wax Museum on Hollywood Blvd. our first full day there. I purchased the ticket as part of a Hollywood CityPASS which included four events for $59. You can buy them at most of the locations that participate or in advance online. We probably spent well over an hour wandering through the museum and had a fun time. You really get tricked out when you first walk in. Don't get in the photographer's way, he may fuss at you! lol Took lots of pictures. About 80 percent of the figures look so alive you would think you were bumping into a real person. I didn't realize how they would be stationed around the room. I guess I was expecting them to be situated in museum like displays. Morgan Freeman and Betty White were awesome realistic! Good clean fun for the whole family! My teenage daughter got a kick out getting her picture made with some of her favorite heart throbs. Lastly, we drove our rental car and parked in the underground parking on Highland Blvd. just north of the intersection with Hollywood Blvd. It is on the same side of the street and under the Kodak Theater. Get your parking pass validated at one of the participating stores and save a couple of dollars. $10 max for all day I believe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CraigsOpinion
50,Good figures with lots of well known ones.,"The wax works were very good and current when we visited it. There were the Avengers in there, including an Iron Man figure. Shrek was outside. I would highly recommend visiting this Madame Tussauds as there are many well known faces in there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/beginningtotravel1
50,The kids had heaps of fun,"This was a great place to visit with children. They recognised most of the figures, and loved having their photo taken with them, we particularly liked our family shot with Obama. The kids even made a wax model of their own hands (at a pretty reasonable cost) as a memento of their visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sandash67
50,Really great experience,"Highly recommend this place in Hollywood! Was really fun and great to see all the celebrity wax statues. Had a professional picture taken of me and President Obama wax statue as well :)Very affordable too. Definitely worth a visit for solo people, friends and family whilst out in Hollywood. 10/10.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chrisn0123

40,Fun for photos!,"This is a great place to take photos! Admission is about $40 a person, typical for most attractions. You get several floors of wax figures. You are allowed to pose with each as long as you do not touch the faces. Friends and I had fun here and thought it was worth the typical price... but not more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeorgiaLily
50,Great fun,"Most of the wax works are really good, you are allowed to touch the figures, just not the faces, so we had great fun playing with the celebs!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GemmaD585
30,Average,"I didn't find this any extra ordinary. I felt dull, and there was no glamor in the ambiance. I would like to see the one in London - I hope that one is good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mikkiforever

50,Great place to visit or bring out of town guests,"Fun, massive inside with lots of great statues etc...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joey22latin
50,So much fun!,This place is great. My son and I had so much fun. We were amazed by how much you can interact with the wax figures and take pictures. Loved it! Just about all of the figures were realistic except Zac Efron - terrible (sorry)!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lizzyborden21
40,Fun with friends,It was included in our pass so we went and had fun taking pictures with the stars and goofing around the wax statues who were really well done. Still I prefer the one in London I visited years ago but if you go with friends you'll have a good time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Marcie_x76
40,Lots of fun!,"Bought the discount tickets online.. was 42.00 for two people. I thought it was very neat! Some of the wax figures look SO real it's crazy! It took us over an hour, we enjoyed ourselves so much. Don't forget your camera, makes for awesome pics with yourself with the celebs ;) I would go back!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JLR1212
30,"Okay, Worth a Shot if You've Never Been","This was my third time visiting a wax museum, I have previously been to the ones in Las Vegas and New York. This one was just okay. The wax figures are impressive, but I don't know that it's worth the price of $25 a person. It's definitely something you should see at least once, but I can't justify going again. I was especially disappointed because there was NO JOHNNY DEPP. What the what? Blasphemy. That was my main reason for going in there because according the their site there's not one, but 2 Johnny Depps, but alas there were none. None Johnny Depps. Disappointing.It also seems like this one is much smaller then the other ones that I've been to. When we got to the exit my friend said, ""is that it?""I agreed. There are probably more interesting places to spend your time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WendyLady03
40,Enjoyed,Took many photos with wax likenesses and had a good laugh,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JAB596
50,Never would have imagined how realistic a wax figure could be.,"Best of all had up to date Stars. Also had many of the old. The set up was great, Example, they have Forrest Gump sitting on his bench in a park. Amazing. Worth every pennie we spent and then some.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/netneth
40,More fun than I expected,Most of the figures were great ....you're allowed to take pictures with them as you please and its all at your own pace ...no hard upsells...Well worth the trip if you've never been before...Loved sitting next to Brando as the godfather and asking him for a favor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Benstl
50,Worth a look,"Was great to wonder round some of the figures not so good, but interesting enough",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/broke1
50,Great fun for all,"We had never been to a wax museum and had the LA Go Card and some time to kill before the Circque show, so we figured why not?We loved it. My girlfriend and I had a ball having our pics taken with George Clooney, etc. and my 10 year old loved it - Jackie Chan, Brittney Spears, etc.There were people of all ages taking lots of pics - you can pose with the wax figures - I am looking forward to going to the one in NY this summer. Well worth the money - especially if you have kids who know all the singers (Bieber, Timberlake, Beyonce, etc.)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/connief517
50,Lots of fun!,Had never been inside and what a treat! There were wax figures of everyone from Lucille Ball to Snoop Dogg. We took teenage boys and they loved it! They are arranged for excellent photo opps! Very well done!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KendalletcW
50,UNCANNILY GOOD!,"We visited the Wax Museum while I was at Pow Wow travel trade show at LA Convention Center. I did not have very high expectations, to be honest. But when we took the elevator upstairs and walked out to what we thought was a fellow visitor holding a camera and kept asking him if he wanted me to take a picture of him with the wax figure, we were shocked to find out it was a wax figure! We found the exhibits were excellent, loved the props many of the figures had (hats, feather boas, etc.) and thought the artistry on some of the figures (Paul Newman and Robert Redford in Sundance; Liz Taylor as Cleopatra; Patrick Swayze in Dirty Dancing (unreal); George Burns; President Obama) ... and so many others were so lifelike and really captured the ""essence"" of the personality! I would highly recommend this Museum to everyone as an excellent place to 'walk down memory lane' or just see how far the art of creating wax figures has really come! It was a terrific two hours!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wpdesousa-mauk
40,worth checking out,"good location, figures were life like, alow at least l hour to see",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/soup154
40,"Good fun, maybe a bit pricey","My partner and I went into Madame Tussauds purely because we had a buy one get on free voucher on admission tickets. It was quite good fun when we got inside and he staff were friendly. It's nothing amazingly special and you get what you expect. As long as you aren't expecting to go in and see real celebs sat around everywhere then you will enjoy yourself. Okay, some of the figures are a bit dodgy looking, but at the end of the day, it isn't the actual person and you have to appreciate the work that goes into the waxworks.The pictures that the staff take with some of the figures are too price though! But it was good fun and I had a good laugh with it. Just don't go in expecting amazing things and you will enjoy yourself. Especially if there is a group of you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gemmatodd90
50,Loved it!,"Spent a great couple of hours here. Bought tickets over the internet which included a free child ticket.We were very impressed with the quality of the waxworks - there were only a handful that didn't resemble the person they represented. Great photo ops with props. My favourites - Will Smith, Johhny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow and Patrick Swayze.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/puddletink
50,WOW!!,"A must visit when you're in Hollywood. Make sure you don't pay full price though as there are many places to get a discount voucher from and just check with your hotel. Most of the figures were very life-like and it was a fun way to spend a few hours. Some of the props that they have to enhance your photos were either missing or needed updating however, which was the only slight negative. An institution that absolutely has something for everyone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kerryntrevor

50,So much fun for all ages!,"A highlight on our recent trip was visiting here. I have been others to others around the world, but nothing beats going to see it in Hollywood!From ""Joan Rivers"" greeting you on arrival, to having your photo with your group on a green screen taken (you can purchase later on which has the Hollywood sign as the backdrop), to seeing different waxes...it is so much fun!Highlight for me was the music room with Simon Cowell, Justin, Beyonce, Ryan, Madonna, and also the awards room with Meryl, Jack, Denzel, Nicole, Mary Hart. These ones looked the most realistic out of them all.I thought Brad and Angelina didn't look too good (time for a fix I think!) and some of the American sports stars I had no idea who they were.You can interact with some of them with their props including Barack, Sylvester, Glee, Pirates, The Rock, and a couple of others. A couple of them have a photographer there to capture you as part of the scene which you can purchase.I can't wait to visit the one in London and Paris later in the year!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jinxyoz
40,Fun with the Stars,This is the first Madame Tussauds we visit and we had lots of fun taking pictures with all the stars. I'm surprised how close we can get to the status and actually touch them (except for their face and hair).,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jen_Min
50,Exceeded our expectations and was really fun for the whole family.,"I haven't been a fan of wax museums, which in my experience were more horror-oriented blood and gore, or shiny-looking figures who look creepy. But Madame Tussauds in Hollywood was totally different, focusing not on horror but on contemporary Hollywood stars, and the quality of the figures was incredible. And instead of viewing the figures from afar, Madame Tussauds encourages you to stand right next to or in front of them, to feel the intensity and realisticness of the figures. You can even touch them (but not their face or hair).Well worth the visit, our 12-year old son and 14 year old daughter thought it was a trip highlight, too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeGStbsnonestdsptndm
40,Mingle with the Stars!,"The artists who made these wax figures are great at what they do. They bear a striking resemblance to their real-life counterparts. The best part is you're encouraged to cozy up to these celebrity look-a-likes and strike your best pose for the camera.There are three levels filled with recognizable stars. One of the funnest parts was being surprised by who was immortalized in wax, so I won't give away any names. They span generations (beloved early movie stars to tween heart throbs) and genres (there are movie stars, musicians, talk show hosts, politicians, and more). Some stars are dressed up as the famous characters from their most popular movies.It can take about an hour to walk through, depending on how you choose to experience it. There are descriptions of each of the characters with a brief biography, so it's possible to make it last even longer. There are deals on their website if you plan ahead and buy online. We paid gate price and still thought it was worth it. It's something different and probably one of the better things to spend your money on in this area. Plus you'll have lots of pictures to show off!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/outtatown1
50,They look so real!,"I am from DC, so I've been to Madame Tussauds before, but it's still fun to go. Great wax figures that looks just like the stars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mdcutie01
50,Fun Galore for everyone in the family!!!!!!,Honestly I had so much fun here it must be illegal. Last night I went to a wax museum was in Niagara Falls Ontario and so I wasn't sure what to expect. This was so creatively done with the staged scenes for example: Scarface Al Pacino blew me away. My other fave was Jack Nicholson sitting on a bench and you can actually sit on the fence and be with your fave star in the photo. I can't believe how life like they were....it was amazing. Excellent helpful staff and a fantastic time. I strongly urge you to check it out you won't be sorry!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cujoetta
40,Great Fun & Photo Opportunities,"I was really surprised that you are encouraged to get up close and personal with the wax figures, the only think they specify is dont play with the hair. It was great watching other people and some of the poses. Make sure your camera is on the correct setting - no flash otherwise its too blurry. You can pay to have professional photos with some exhibits however we were not informed of this when we purchased out tickets. This would have been a good idea. All in all a fun cheap thing to do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AarondQueensland
20,most certainly not worth the money,"This was one of those, well we might as well since we are here things to do - I would not have paid for it, I can tell you that.I think it's really mean that they put Brad and Angelina near Jennifer Aniston - but when the first wax figure you see is Joan Rivers, what is what to expect.Can you say tacky!! Well wax figures can.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SMacDonald

30,There are better wax museums.,"Good, but doesn't seem as extensive as NY.Pricey, if you don't get a discount coupon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Salf
30,Fun visit,"I have never been to a wax museum before. I think it seems a bit pricey for what it is, it takes about 30-45 mins to go through and for a cost of $35 for an adult and student this seems high. Where is Marilyn Monroe? They have mostly older actors, a select few of the newer ones. Robert Pattinson and Justin Beiber seemed to be the most recent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FloridianAtHeart
40,Madame Tussauds Wax Museum,"Has up to date Hollywood stars, and sections for different eras.Have a bit of fun taking photos with all the realistic looking models, seeing who looks more real than others, who is tall or short and what you didn't expect. Fun to go with a few people and have a laugh. Costs about $25 each to get in though...a little pricey seeing as you are in and out in about 30-40 minutes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travelbunny63
50,so much fun!,"My 12-year-old and I went to Madame Tussauds not knowing what to expect, and it was so much more fun than we expected! The wax figures are SO LIFELIKE you can't believe it, and you can pose with them, touch them, and take photos with them. There were figures of current celebrities as well as old time movie stars, sports stars, and music stars as well. We were very entertained for a few hours, and took lots of great photos! Definitely worth the trip!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/null
50,So Realistic.,The wax figures were so real which was suprising. It was well worth the $15 we paid to get into the museum. Great photo opportunities and nice and central location. Easy afternoon attraction as it is open until 10pm!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jessp354
40,Waxing wonderful,"This place is so much fun. It was amazing to stand next to stars that we had seen since we were children, and to be surprised at how tall, or tiny they were in real life. It is a great place to spend a few hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SueV869
50,So much fun to take photos with the stars,"My wife and I made our first stop on Hollywood Blvd waiting for our Star Line tours so we decided to go into Madame Tussauds wax museum for fun. We bought a 48 hr pass with Star Line tours so the wax museum was included since they had a partnership. I have no idea what the real price is.It was a quick 1.5 hr tour that you take at your own pace over the 3 floors but I am so glad we brought the camera. We took so many pictures interacting with the wax celebrities. They had some objects to wear so that you can get good photos. All the adults will have fun here but the only stars there for kids were Shrek, Ironman, Spiderman, and Wolverine...otherwise the kids may find this boring.Highly recommended for the touristy Hollywood experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tpinet
40,Get to meet the stars,"Plenty of space to wander, good quality exhibits that look so good in the photos with you. Professional photos taken as well for you to check out on the way out, no pressure. If you have a few taken, the memory stick is a good buy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chris_Bren_248
50,This place is soo COOL!!,"First time to a Madame Tussauds, came with a friend. It was AMAZING! The 'statues' are soo life like! We were expecting some of them to jump out at us or to blink!It wasn't as busy as we were expecting which was great! The atmosphere of the place is great! a great playlist playing too! It was a little disappointing to see that Beyonce wasn't there.Such a fun place to visit while in Hollywood!We got some real cool photos! Make sure you have a fully charged camera and lots of space on your memory card when you go!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/284BrianT
40,Meeting celebrities in the Wax,"The Museum, my first visit to a Madame Tussaud's Museum, was a pleasant surprise. Some of the figures were really great. The placement of some of them were well thought out, like the Brad Pitt-Angelina Jolie pair being looked on by the Jennifer Aniston figure. The photographer at the entrance was great. we waited afew minutes for him to finish before realizing he was a statue.The Obama Desk made a very good photo op. The in-house photographers did a good job. I would recommend them. Some of the figures like Stallone's could do with a bit more muscle. Some looked taller than what we see in the movies. Kids should have a photo taken with Spiderman and get a Print.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pnmenon
30,Fun place to go with your friends!,"I was actually surprised how fun this was! Great place to go with friends to have a few good laughs and get some fun pictures. Some of the figures look extremely life like. They also have props at some of the figures for picture taking.I would think this would be boring to go to by yourself and not a lot of the figures are geared toward kids. There are lots of great places to check out over this attraction in the greater LA area, but still a fun place and it would be a good stop if you are spending the day in the Hollywood area for sightseeing/attractions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aurora_DE
40,So much fun,"We had a lot of laughs at Madame Tussaud's, it was way more fun than I expected! If you order your tickets online, you get 5 bucks off. Admission is normally 25 for adults, 18 for students, and 15 for children 4-17. They provide props and scenes so you can pose with your favorite stars. Staff were very friendly. Bathroom facilities were clean with changing tables.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ErikaA758
50,Tussaudes rocks,Great lifel like statues and heaps of them liked the set up and staff were great. Price was reasonable too,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SharonH553
50,Great fun was had by all!,"We thoroughly enjoyed our time at the wax museum. We spent three hours inside. We also walked the Walk of Fame and had a blast! The street was much quieter before 11am and therefore a little easier to navigate, but was also a blast when the crowds were out! We ate at Planet Hollywood - I would def give that a miss!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KatherineAMF
40,Lots of fun!,"Some of the funniest pictures of our entire trip were taken here.... Our teenagers (and us) loved taking pictures with their favourite celebrities figures and in general had lots of fun!! In all a very goofy and fun visit. If you have older children or teens, DON'T MISS IT!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RoxinBA
50,FUN!!!,My husband wasn't sure about this venue but I wanted to walk through it. He came out amazed. The figures are so realistic looking that you walk by thinking it really is the celebrity pretending to be a wax figure.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mayaelena
20,"over priced, too short of a tour","over priced, too short of a tour, once is enough to go here",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SanPedroLocals
50,Fun place to hang out,"My mother and I took some really fun pictures in this museum. It's not overly crowded and most of the wax sculputures look so real. Some of them make you go ""huh."" Anyway, If you want to take a break from Hollywood Blvd., enjoy your time inside and take some funny pictures.It's three floors and you can take a pic with the wax Pres. Barack Obama, Beyonce, Lady Gaga, Michael Corleone, and at the Breakfast with Tiffany's scene.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1Rabbit
40,"Take your picture with the ""stars""!",This was a FUN stop on my trip! I used my Go L.A. Pass and was really glad I decided to stop here. It was amazing how lifelike the wax figures were---NOT creepy like other wax museums I've been to. I LOVE that they let you take pictures with the figures and you can touch them. GREAT place for photo opts!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnson062610
40,Wax never looked so good!,This was a fun little outing for my family. The kids really enjoyed seeing their favorite movie stars and singers in a life size wax figure. They looked so real it was almost scary! Plenty of fun for all ages to be had here. Don't forget that camera!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carolinelomeli
30,Don't pay to go in,We got in free with our hop on hop off bus and spent 15 minutes in here. It is average. The London one is much better. They try to take professional photos of you with some of the figures. It is not a must see in Hollywood!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Emma071
50,Loved it,We had a great time getting photos and looking at the wax figures.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KrystleJones
50,Surprisingly fun!,"We hesitated on paying $50 for the two of us to go in, but we're so glad we did. The figures were so lifelike and there were so many photo opportunities! A couple times I studied the figure to make sure it wasn't a real person and once I walked behind a person taking a photo of George Lopez so I wouldn't ruin his shot -- then I realized the photographer was also wax! We spent quite a bit of time there and thoroughly enjoyed it. We recommend it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Judy2001
50,Madame Tussauds Wax Museum,"Loved it, you can get up close & have your photo taken with each figure they are not roped off like most wax museumsPut your arm around them for a photo some you sit withMost are very life like, best wax museum I have been to.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fredsredt
50,they looked SO real,fun to photgraph with and really spacious and open adn you can do it quite quick- 45 minutes,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deeferla
40,Well worth it.,"I enjoyed Madame Tussauds Hollywood very much. I've been to the one in NY, and it's worth visiting this even if you've been there. The wax dolls are macnificent and really life like up close. Don't miss out on something to eat accross the road.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Happyhpk
50,lifelike,"The wax figures are really lifelike. The hosts are some of the nicest in any attraction you will find in Hollywood. You can take really awesome pictures and even try to fool your friends. It's a lot bigger on the inside than it appears. 3 floors of figures separated by theme such as western, mafia, old hollywood, music, etc. They also have a green screen photo opportunity where they change the background of your picture. I love that if you ask the hosts to take pictures for you they will do it on your camera...often they approach guests and ask them if they want a photo even. And there are wax people outside that you can see and take pictures with for free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Puppetgirldotnet
50,Almost scary!,This place has to be seen to be believed! The figures are SOOO life like it is awesome!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/phil3150
40,If you want to see a celeb,"This attraction was included in our City Pass ticket. After visiting the one in New York, I was a little disappointed in the size and lack of figures. While I would not waste my money next time, it was an enjoyable visity.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lauraw46
30,Not a fan,It just didn't grab us. We had discounted entry from another tour but found this a bit slow and boring for us.Only really good one was staring Hannibel Lecter in the eye!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/252michaelc
40,Same as the others - but still great fun!,Very good fun! Still cheesy and similar to the NY / London / other ones but still a good laugh and worth it when you want to kill some time,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravellingMonkeyUK
40,feel like a star,Come in Mme Tussaud in Los Angeles and you really get the feeling that you are participating at an Oscar evening.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mjnvakantiecoach
50,Excellent wax museum,Madame Tussauds' reputation is well deserved for the whole family. Pictures are even recommended by the museum and the staff.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G1987FZpierrem
40,Good experience,"It took about 2 hours to walk through the whole museum and take pictures. It was a good experience overall. The only problem was when we got our hands made of wax, it took forever to get them done, there was only one person working the stand and a very long line. We waited for about an hour. Wouldn't have waited that long had we not prepaid for it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AG162
40,45 mins of fun for the kids,"Was not planning to visit Madame Tussauds, but once the kids (and my wife) saw it they were adamant. My two teenage daughters ran around with complete abandon mimicking all the actors, singers, celebreties and sports people. Rather infectious really. Mindless Fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Harry_Melbourne_Aus
30,Wax works who worked the Wax?,"Not nearly as good as the one in London, many of the wax figures made the real stars look tired, old and haggered. Needs some real professional to work the wax here",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmbassadorBas
30,Not as Good As New York's Madame Tussauds,Not as good in my opinion as the NY museum but it's still worth checking out if you're interested in posing with celebrities and telling you're friends that you actually met these people!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/agsdiamond
40,A fun couple of hours,"We had a lot of fun at Madame Tussauds!It was very empty the day we were there, so we got to be silly and take lots of funny photos with the figures, which kept us entertained for a couple of hours.The figures are amazing, some of them are eerily real, very well done! Don't miss it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/odyssey1977

40,Small but well worth it with discount vouchers. . .,"Some great waxworks, some not so great. I liked the interactive sports section of this one, which I haven't seen in other Tussauds. I have reviewed it on the price I paid, which was heavily discounted (you shouldn't have a problem finding deals in the area). If I had paid the, I think ridiculous full price, my rating would be very different.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JJno41
40,Interesting - good for families,"After all the hype you see on TV, I was a ""little disappointed"" in some of the displays. Whilst they are amazing, some don't look as 'real' as they are portrayed on TV. However, I think it's a must see and buy your tickets when you get there as they offer discounts everywhere. Look at buying the Go LA Card - it is great value and covers nearly 40 attractions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Speegal
50,Very Life Like Wax Figures,A little pricy but fascinating replication of famous people. It was even better taking pictures next to the wax figures!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mariejolie
30,EhhH.,"This was okay but definately not something for repetition. Kindof boring and slow. Pricey however some of the was figures are representational of their characters. However, some look nothing like the characters.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TrisHAnNDecE
30,We had fun,"We had fun interacting with the stars. Some stars look fantastic and some look totally ridiculous, the more plastic surgery the star has had the more real they looked. all in all, if you have the time it's worth a visit. We received free tickets when we booked our tour with Starline movie stars homes tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/keenastraveller
50,AMAZING,"This place is truley amazing the work here is unreal! The wax sculptures are crazy real, some better than otheres, you can get your hand done in wax if you want for only $15 super cool, great place!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leelee6789
30,Some of the wax models were spookily realistic,"We got a good ticket combination at MT's ticket office ($160 for 4 adults to enter MT and do the Starline Hop on Hop off 48hr tour). Starline even after their ""discounts"" wanted $120 for just their tickets alone.Some of the models were extremely realistic and you are aloud to touch them (except faces and hair). The Lady Gaga was very good!! They also have just got the Beatles in from the London MT which was cool. The museum is over 3 floors which you take an elevator to the 3rd floor at the start of your tour, then work your way down. My two teenage children really enjoyed it.My daughter made her own ""wax hand"" for $15 which was fun and not overpriced.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pap1973
40,A must for funny vacation photos,"Much smaller then the one in London. Use the 50% off coupon in the Where magazine, otherwise $25 per person is overpriced. I liked the 4 professional photo ops during the visit. Only picture I will likely ever have with me and president. They let you touch the displays, they look very life like.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/92hb
40,more interesting than I thought it would be!,make sure to get discounted tix which are widely available.They come free with Starline purchase of 48 ho-ho bus,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/betti14

40,It does not disapoint,We´ve been to quite a few Madame Tussauds and this one did not disapoint us. If you have a chance go check it out. It was fun to have all the props available to interact with the celebs.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JensogSetta
40,very good,this was a great way tospend a few hours and how else can you sit next to will smith,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joannen396
40,Really good,"Could be expensive, but look for 2 for 1 coupons, it is really well done, not alot of ""statues"" but nicely displayed. I was amazed how small some of the actors are, I am assuming they are ""life size"".",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oldbeast
30,Blah.,Boring and dirty. Skip this and Ripley's Believe it or Not.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ad669
50,What fun!,"I had so much fun at this museum. The wax figures are so life-like. I would not have been surprised if one didn't start talking of moving as I was staring them in the face. What a shock that would have been! The museum has props throughout, so you can interact with the figures for lots of photo fun. The only rule is that you can't touch the faces or hair. I definitely recommend a visit to Madame Tussaud's.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/caram30
40,"So quiet, and unrushed","Compared to other Madam Tussauds, this one was so well spaced out, very quiet on the day we visited, and the models, were set in good scenes, rather then just standing there. You must tke your camera, my mates back home really thought i bumped into LADY GAGA whilst I was in LA.A really good place to put an hour or more in",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alisdairt
40,Good couple of hours fun!,Or maybe not quite 2 hours!! Good interaction opportunities. Our 11 year old daughter thoroughly enjoyed having her photo taken with the wax models Some more life like than others. CAMERA is a must or it would be less fun!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/loveydoveyz
30,ok,good price go look for yourself lots of fun wife said it was nice,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dingo_pup_1
40,Great fun.,"We have never been to Madame Tussauds before but as it was included in our ""Go Los Angeles"" card we decided to visit it. It was actually great fun and the exhibits all looked real. Sometimes you could get a little freaked out when you thought you'd bumped into someone and it was actually a waxwork model! There was also a theme with appropriate music such as pop singers together with pop music playing. We all enjoyed it and got carried away taking lots of photos.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leedsrubysandy
50,Fun for kids and parents!,This is a great tourist attraction right on the Hollywood Walk of Fame & close to restaurants and shops. It's something to do if you have only a short amount of time or if you want to pack a lot in on one day. Having your camera with you is a must! Wax figures are very realistic looking & scenes/settings for the caracters make great groupings. Highly recommended.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MAN318

30,The best way to see stars in Hollywood,"I visited Madame Tussaud's in Hollywood. They had some really good displays and some looked very real. It was very fun to see the actual size of the stars, and they will most likely be the only stars you will see! You can get right up close to them which is great for photos. I went here as part of the City Pass.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tinagirltravels

30,A little smaller than expected,I guess they have have a rotating exhibit - expected more figures. Some are more convincing than others. But my 10 yr old daughter had a blast so it was worth it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jacqueline_Cambodia
40,Pretty Good Wax Figures,"I like going to wax museums to check out the realism of the figures. This museum does a really good job of recreating the famous celebrities and stars from Vivian Leigh (Gone with the Wind) to Lady Gaga. If the figures are also correct proportions (height and size), many of them were quite surprising, i.e. how tall Howard Hughes was, how small Salma Hayek was and how big the Gears of War figures are! Definitely worth a visit, especially if you get a half price discount ticket they pass out everywhere along Hollywood Blvd.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Durwoody
50,Very lifelike,"Well, laid out and all sets were realistic. Almost walked in front of a photographer, wait a minute......nope, not real.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dineric

30,A good bit of silly fun,"I've never really fully understood the attraction of wax museums but as these museums go, it was quite a good one! The figures were good and were generally set up in such a way that good photos were possible. It's probably not worth the exorbitant price though...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hollyh76
30,Small,"We got a great deal on Groupon, $10 per person. Let me start by saying I've visited Madame Tussauds in Amsterdam and London, and those seemed a lot bigger to me. The Hollywood museum was quite small. Still, it was good fun. In some rooms there are props that you can use to take pics with the celebrities. I think we spend about an hour and a half walking around. My favorite was Jack Sparrow!We had a coupon for a free wax hand, it was a cool experience. The ice-water hurted like hell, but it served its purpose because I hardly felt the wax. Our wax hands did not survive a plane trip though...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PoisonedIvy

50,Great way to spend an hour or two in hollywood,This was a lot of fun. It is easy to entertain yourself posing with the wax sculptures. I did get the tickets free with my hotel booking so maybe I would think differently if I paid the 25 pp.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chelslynne
30,you might like it or not!,this is one of those iffy attractions!it all depends on what you like!if you want to see wax figures that look like they will reach out and touch you....go for it!it is good but i'd rather spend that money on something else!some like it cuz there is a long line sometimes! and people are paying the money!so--like i said..it's just not my cup of tea! but you just might like it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hbsurfer1
30,Great to take silly pictures,"I got a coupon for $8 off which you can get from your hotel concierge or tourguide. Which made my tour $17 instead of $25. Also they offer a student discount so bring ur id if you qualify.I had fun taking silly pictures here. It's not that big but there is three floors of celebrities. Well one of the floors is used to show u how they make the wax and for wax hand molds. and like 5 celebrities.The let you in one group at a time so you don't crowd everyone. They also have some props for you to wear or use to take pics with certain celebs but most of them have gone missing and need to be replaced.what's cool is that the celebs are real sized so you can see how tall they really are. You can hug them, put your hand on them....but you're not allowed to touch their face or hair.it would be cooler if you could take your pic and the celebs faces looked more realistic. but flash makes a shiny spot in their head and makes them look glossy, and no flash is just dark :(",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/monsternina
50,Fun place!,"Had lots of fun, loved that the figures are not behind glass but out where you can touch and take pics with them. They even have background settings and props to encourage patrons to interact. Self guided and just fun. Price was very reasonable, $25 for adult, $20 for seniors and had free attraction brochure from hotel that gave $5 discount off adult admission.

50,So real you'll keep waiting for them to say boo,"All I can say is WOW! I like wax museums, but they have nothing on Madame Tussauds. The wax figures were so real we kept waiting for them to blink. It is well worth the $25 admission.Once you visit Madame Tussauds, all the other wax museums you visit will seem cheap and low quality.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KenG803
50,The full Hollywood experience,"A lot of great stars and photo opportunities. If you don't spot any stars in L.A., you can do it here. We've been to Madame Tussauds in New York, Las Vegas and London and this one measures up.In front of the Hard Rock Madame Tussauds people are in red shirts and handing out coupons. Usually they are 20% off.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoyceTravel
50,Amazing place.,Now I have tons of pictures taken with celebrities! Kids love it. Everything looks so REALLLLLLLLLLLLL....,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JustinW32
50,SO FUN,"Okay we caved and took a stupid bus tour around Hollywood but that came with two tickets to Madame Tussauds which we were going to skip after a very long, hot day but we got in the long line anyway....my husband started to sigh and i lived in London for 6 months steps away for the London Madame Tussauds and never went in--stupid and tourist-y------but here i am 20 years later going in Hollywood, CA------OMG! It was the most fun we had in Hollywood-----you can touch the statues (not the face or hair) but they even give you props for pictures---they encourage you to take pictures--- my husband and i are in our 40's and we made fools out of ourselves--just like everyone else---you have to get into the mood and start posing with the statues and using the props---we had soooooo much fun and got the best pictures-----my 7th grade students are going to laugh so hard seeing me in pic with lady gaga and president obama-----if it wasn't free i wouldn't have gone---not sure if it's worth $50 for the two of us---- but tons of fun",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/irishhadc
50,Best wax museum,"I've been to a few wax museums but this is the best. The wax figures are SO realistic (most of them) and you can get right up close and personal: they tell you when you go in ""you can touch them and get as close as you want, just don't touch their heads or hair."" Definitely something you have to do once. FREE PARKING if you park at the Kodak theater (very close to the museum) if you buy anything in the building above the parking and get your parking pass validated (we just bought peach rings at the Rocky Mt. Chocolate Factory). Worth the charge to go once. Buy online and you'll get a discount (even if you buy the same day).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnonymousRex
50,They look so real it's almost creppy.....,"After visting the second floor of the museum, my husband and I thought it was the end, and we were quite satisfied with the museum. But there was much more to the museum that we did not expect. There are costumes and props you can wear to take pictures with the characters. This was the best wax museum I have ever been too. Also, if you want to do a couple of things while your in Hollywood take advantage of the CityPass, which will save you some money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/samb929
40,"Great time, great value",Not too much to say here that other people haven't already said. My wife and I had a great time here. Many of the wax figures look real...even when standing real close. We had a ball taking candid pictures and having many laughs while going through this attraction. I had never been to a wax museum before and would definitely go again to another one after visiting this location. I would estimate a typical visit time of 2 hours to get through everything if you really interact with all of the figures and exhibits.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/funlovingcouple157
40,Great laugh!,This is s great way to spend an hour. The photo opportunities are priceless. Well worth a visit,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravellinTash
50,Amazing place.,"I love Madame Tussauds Hollywood! Its a lovely and fun place to visit with your family, friends, partner, kids, etc. Its a must-see when youre in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/princesspm
40,"Very fun, great with a group of friends, a little too pricey and not quite big enough","Get your cameras ready, because this is THE place is Hollywood to get your picture taken. The wax sculptures are of course breathtakingly realistic, but the museum also sets up great photo-ops. The atmosphere of each room serves as a backdrop to where the picture might be taken if you were starring in the movie alongside that character, which makes the experience that much more fun. Friends will love this place, as it appeals to those picture-savvy groups who want to cherish their memories with scrapbooks or social network sharing. Although museum was quite fascinating, there was not enough to see to support its $25 admission fee. Don't get me wrong, the exhibits that were there were wonderful, but it left a little too much to be desired. I would only recommend this for those who plan to take many pictures, because those who plan to only explore might find themselves completing the museum within a short amount of time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BenjaminOdom
50,Awesome Wax Museum!,"It's at a great location and the wax figures look exactly like the real people and they have so much detail put into them! At the end of the tour you end up at Graumen's Chinese Theatre and right before you exit they show you how they make the wax figures and how much work goes into them! Just make sure to take your camera, because your going to get a lot of great pictures!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travel_Man1122
30,Not a Big Attraction,"We went here as we had free access via our Go Los Angeles Card. We spent about 50 minutes inside and whilst most of the models are excellent the novelty of it didn't keep us (family of six with youngest two 10 years old) enthralled to spend any longer in there. There are the expected 'official' photos with Barack Obama and Marilyn Monroe, but to be fair the photographer also takes pictures on your own camera too. OK as a filler between other stuff, but I wouldn't plan it in as a big part of your day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RooActon
30,First time to a wax works place and probably the last,"not sure what I expected but some of the wax impressions were really good, some were appalling.My overall impression was that a lot of the women were much shorter than I expected and Vivien Leigh was the most beautiful woman in there. And Clint Eastwood was HOT.Not good value in my view at $USD25 for somewhere I walked through in less than 30 mins.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nethercote
50,A FUN PLACE,Me and my family just got back from California and Madame Tussauds was such a fun spot so many stars old and new and they even have prps for you to use to take your pictures with them we loved it!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wewafinest
40,"A fun place to take pictures with the ""stars""","Our family enjoyed seeing the various ""stars"" throughout. We were able to take a leisurely tour past many wax exhibits. My young adult daughters were taking pictures all around from the newest actors/entertainers to Audrey Hepburn and others. My wife and I enjoyed it as well and now are glad for the variety of pictures taken there. Certainly worth seeing and enjoying with others.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RichThornton_11
50,Most amazing wax museum ever!!,It was very real it was like they were there with you.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/N24ascar
50,Kids had a blast in this wax museum,"We passed the other wax museums in L.A, but this one, Madame Tussauds (from the ones on display) seemed to be the most ""real."" We had so much fun running around taking and posing for pictures. The kids loved it. Will Smith is a favorite of ours and the kids did multiple poses with him. The really neat thing is that the wax figures are made to size ---- height and weight. Many of the stars were significantly taller or shorter than we had imagined. Clint Eastwood was gigantic while Peneope Cruz was about as big around as a pencil as was Audrey Hepburn. Great place to visit --- don't skip it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LoveMeSomeOysters
50,Very fun,"We had a great time here- if you can get into posing with the ""celebrities"" you will have a very good time. Some of the figures are lifelike while a few leave you wondering ""who is that supposed to be?"" Very good mix of past and current stars kept the varying ages in our group entertained. The location is terrific- right next to the Chinese Theatre.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kimmer76
50,A real must-visit attraction!,I visitied Madame Tussaud’s Wax Musuem in Los Angeles during my stay. It was so fabulous and the figures are so professionally made. The staff are very helpful and offer to help you for taking a photo using your camera. I went on a Monday morning and enjoyed spending around one hour in there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mehran_2008
50,Half of my vacation pics are from this one place :),"Our family went with our Go Los Angeles cards, so was a free attraction. Travelling with 2 teen girls, its hard to please them. But this place was so much fun..with exception to the 2nd floor (too old for them) They had so many current celebs, from sports, to actors to singers. It was great. The staff encourage you to interact minus touching the hair or faces of the ""celebrities"". It can get congested so go in with that in mind, you have to take turns taking pics but its well worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jenspen1975
50,So much fun!,"Our 13 year old daughter begged us to take her here, and as we had a buy one entry, get one free voucher, we reluctantly went in. Well we all had so much fun! You can pose with all the figures and there were even props and outfits for you to dress up in for your pics. We loved every minute and took loads of great photos. Most of the figures were very realistic, just a few were pretty fake looking. So glad we spent the money. We had already been to the Wax Museum in San Francisco and this one was sooo much better!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sooziegirl
40,A Fun Experience!,"My sister and I were visiting Hollywood and decided that it would be fun to ""meet"" the celebrities. We went to Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum and had a great time posing and taking pictures with all of the figurines. I enjoyed how there were a wide variety of wax figures and props you could use as well. Many of the wax figures looked so real that I'm sure friends looking at our photos would think we were with the actual celebrity. However, a couple of the wax figures did look a little ""off"". The downside is that it is a little pricey at $25 a person, but worth it if you love taking fun pictures!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/twin2kayte
30,I've seen better,"This is my second time at a Madame Tussauds'. The other time was in NYC. I don't know if my memory isn't that great (I only went about 2 years ago to the NYC one), but I felt like a lot of the wax figures in LA did not have that life-like quality, particularly of the classic actors. Maybe that's because they didn't have them as models when the figures were made? Still a fun place to visit, but I probably would not have gone if it weren't a listed attraction on my Go Los Angeles card.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RammsteinNicCage
40,Take pictures with the stars!,"Well I guess no trip to Hollywood is complete without taking some pictures with the stars. I would't rate it very good yet then again it was above average, tripadvisor has no in between yet rather enjoyed ourselves so gave 4/5.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YK-Northernlights
20,not worth the time and money,its just a few floors of wax figures and nothing else..really aint the time and effort and it took us less than an hour to walk through the entire museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/evabree
50,Touristy but a Classic!,"Madame Tussauds is definitely a must for people who have never been to LA. Some family of mine from Austin came in the other day and had heard of it before (obviously). We all went and it cost $25.00 a ticket, which isn't so bad for LA!The wax sculptures look totally real, and my little cousins loved taking pictures with Kobe. Definitely a must do with the family, or a must do for people who have never been to LA before.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TyrellS
50,Mother Daughter Adventure,This place was great. It cost 25.00 a ticket. I bought a LA Entertainment book for 21.00 & was able to print off a 2 for 1 offer to Madame Tussauds. Your able to get close & take great pictures with your favorite celebrity. Great time. Plus this is next door the the famous theater. Busy area with lots of tourists.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Labellamac
50,Get crazy!,"Yes, you can tell they're fake. But we had a blast coming up with crazy poses and making funny videos. When you get to the blue screen where they take your pix, Don't just pose, jump on your mates back, or in their arms, or .... The guy at check out pix desk said he'd never seen anyone do that, and our pix was awesome! We even went back and did a few more. If you're wearing white, it bleeds through the pix and whites out the pix digital scenery. If you can, wear colors when you visit. Park in city lot adjacent to Kodak Theatre, and remember to buy SOMEthing, even a water bottle. You'll get gree parking when leaving if you have receipt validated from any shop in Kodak Theatre. You can see the Hollywood sign from 2nd and 3rd floors of Theater, but it's far. Not good for a pix with a person in it, as camera will focus on person and sign is blurred out. Walk to In and Out Burger for lunch. YUM! We visited in morning/afternoon on Friday. It wasn't scary at all like people wrote. It was crowded, so I guess we picked a good day. Some event/movie screening was planned for that night. Oh, great gift store at Tussauds!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StewardessFl
40,surprisingly fun,"This was a surprisingly fun place to visit. You'll probably enjoy it most if you like movies and movie stars. The wax figures are scattered around in lifelike poses... it's a little creepy, because you sometimes can't tell at a glance if it's a real person (i.e., a tourist) or wax. Some of the wax figures are incredibly life-like, others are off by a little bit, hard to say why. Take a camera, it's fun to pose with your favorite actors/actresses. It was a little pricey... $86 for a 2+2 family. But we spent 2 hours there and had a lot of fun, so it was worth it. It's not the kind of thing we'd ever do again, but we would recommend it to others.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/flipper314
40,A very fun museum,I've been to other Wax museums and this is the best. Not only because of they great variety but because of the decoration and service. Most of them (95%) look very real and it's very cool how they put them. If you are around Hollywood come here you will not regret.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrDandy00
50,Fun place to 'meet' the stars!,"This was a fun place to 'meet' the stars. Madame Tussauds Wax Museum Hollywood is located next to Grauman Chinese Theater and Walk of Fame, so it's conviently located when visiting Hollywood. We came early in the morning and it was not crowded at all, which was good because we can take pictures without waiting for other people and we could take as much time as we like. The wax look real and there are many stars featured here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/awesome_world2010
40,"Although expensive, a fun place to visit.","The wax celebs definitely look real. We took a lot of fun pics. They even give you props to use. I would look for a coupon at the hotel to save a little. For 2 people, it was $53 which is quite pricey.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/null
40,Bit of Fun,Madame Tussauds was a fun experience where you get the opportunity to take your photo with (mostly) life-like celebrity wax figures. It's great because it's self paced so you can spend as much or as little time there as you like. We could only stay for 45 minutes as we had a tour booked but we didn't feel as though we missed out on anything. Possibly a little pricey (although you can get a discount of a few dollars if you get a brochure first).,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SydneyTravelBug3
50,awesome good time,"went with a coupon from a friend and had a ton of fun. not what i expected, i was expecting a bunch of wax people. the statues are amazingly done, my family and i had a great time taking tons of pictures. i liked the fact that there are scenes and you can take video/pics of you actually in the scene of the movie. definately doesn't deserve a museum title...too much laughing and fun! would take friends if i'm in town.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/juon
50,SO MUCH FUN!!! A MUST SEE!!!,"We were a little skeptical about going to a Wax Museum, but it turned out to be so much fun! The tickets are a little pricey $25 but we had a coupon. It was fun to see all of the wax people because they look extremely real. You are afraid that all of a sudden they'll come to life and blink! The museum had props next to the wax figurines which was fun for the pictures. We spent a good hour or so in the museum. It was definitely worth the money... I would recommend everyone to try it at least once!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AZ_432
50,Well worth a visit,"Michael Jackson was the hot wax model when we visited in September, but the whole place is cool and lots of fun with lots of the big names. Great that you can pose and get lots of fun shots. Have visited a was museum before, but this one is by far the best.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/surfbreak
50,A must see!!!,THis is definitely worth your trip to LA. We live in Vegas and we have one there but never went but after seen the one here in Hollywood - we will definitely go see the one in Vegas and other locations if we are there.The wax figures are so lifelike and the props that we are able to use for pictures make it so much better for our pics.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bmxmom38
50,I felt like I was meeting real stars!!!!,"The Madame Tussauds Wax Museum Hollywood was one of my favorite things our family did while on vacation in Hollywood. The wax figures were extremely real looking, I could fool my friends into thinking I met real stars! Make sure you bring a camera to this attractions, I think I took over 100 pictures here! Each wax figure had their own themed background, plaque with mini biography, props, and some even had props for you to wear in your photo with them. You were allowed to touch the figures, so you could give them a hug or hook arms with them in your photo op. There was a great combination of older and recent celebrities, so it adds an element of education to the experience. Some of the MANY stars my family posed with were Marilyn Monroe, Carrie Underwood, Whoopi Goldberg, Audrey Hepburn, and my personal favorite: Robert Pattinson (I'm a HUGE Twilight Saga fan, so getting to hug ""Edward"" was a dream come true).If your looking to have a memorable visit in Hollywood, I would definitely include this in my list of ""must-see's""!!!!(written by gina's daughter)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gina2
50,Go early and have a fab time!,"Used our Go Los Angeles cards to visit Madame Tussauds wwith husband and two teenage sons. Arrived at opening at 10am and had the place virtually to ourselves. Took many pictures with loads of 'celebrities', even had props available to make it more realistic! You get right up close to the models. Much better than I expected. We all thoroughly enjoyed our visit!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HampshireBird
50,We had a blast!,"We went to Madame Tussauds and were so glad we did. We got to do some incredibly crazy poses with some of the stars and take pictures, we just couldn't touch the face area. I kept looking into Simon Cowell's eyes expecting him to talk to me, he looked that real. The fact that two 50 something year old and two 20 something year olds both had a great time speaks to the fact that there is something for everyone.The only thing I was disappointed about was that we had booked a Starline tour from our hotel two days before because of the pick up service and never knew that we could have gotten in the museum for free with a tour package. We would have booked right from the Boulevard had we known this.Enjoy and don't forget your camera!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Clarabellenh
50,More fun than I ever would have expected.,"Oddly, this might be the place my husband and I enjoyed the most while in LA for 2 days. I expected to go through and be out in 30 mins. We stayed for an hour and a half! It was so fun. I was thrown off by how much fun I had here. You get in for free if you book a Starline Tour. It ws much better than the Starline tour too. I don't want to ruin it by explaining too much. I'll just say that it is well put together, and both adults and kids alike were really enjoying themselves.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/free2venture
50,"very exciting, Very good pictures to make, would go back anytime!","I had always wanted to visit a Madame Tussauds Museum and I was not disappointed at all. It is a very fun museum, and the wax figures are so lifelike it's almost creepy: you think they will come alive anytime!You can make fun photos with them, sit with them etc.I highly recommend it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/celinetmika
40,Hollywood Wax Museum,"I really didn't want to go to the wax museum. Wifes idea. However, I was really surprised and happy we went. It was a lot of fun. You spend all your time posing with the stars and taking pictures. It was great.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shivits
50,"Best Wax Museum, Don't Waste Your $ With any other!","It was my first time to Hollywood, and went to the Madame Tussaud's Wax Musuem. It was easy to find, located next to the famous Chinese theater. I've been to other wax museums before and this one was the best by far! There was no guessing ""Who is this suppose to be?"", all the figures looked like who they were supposed to look like!! All the big stars were there from Brad & Angelina, to George Clooney, Hugh Jackman and my personal favorite Johnny Depp. :) And of course the Classics stars were there like Charlie Chaplin, Bette Davis, Audrey Hepburn, and the Marilyn Monroe was so beautiful! What I liked about Madame Tussaud's is that the wax figures weren't behind velvet ropes or up on a platform, they were on a open floor and the staff encourages you to get up close and put your arm around them, and take lots of pictures! Also I liked that it was interactive with different props you can use and put on to really make your pictures that much more fun. I would really recommend Madame Tussaud's to anyone, I had a great time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/biancatravels
