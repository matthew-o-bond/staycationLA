50,Not of the faint hearted!,Not for the faint hearted but one of the most bizarre museums I’ve been to. Entry fee is a bit steep but worth it for the weirdness that you wouldn’t see anywhere else. We took our 2 older teens but I wouldn’t recommend taking younger teens or children though as some of the photos and portrayals are a bit graphic.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clairemeech
50,my favorite museum!!,"this was my number 1 NEED to visit while in LA and it didn’t disappoint! a large variety of different “death” topics covered and of course, my favorite, an entire serial killer room. a tough stomach is my only suggestion, because you’re going to see a lot of blood and gruesome death scenes. there was a lot of history and interesting exhibits. 11/10 would recommend. i’ll definitely visit again!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/noeleberhard
50,Museum is closed,I looked on the web site the night before and realized the museum is closed. Called the number on the web site and someone answered and they said the museum is closed and they are trying to find a new location and will be open in 6 months,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janellsc41
50,Must see,"heard about this place by chance whilst in LA. A must see if you are into serial killers, gore, death etc.. Some really awesome and shocking things on display. Reasonably priced to enter with cool souvenirs to buy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traveller4928
50,Love this place,This place is absolutely amazing. Not for children. Lots of real life photos of death and dismemberment,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amybQ8572OM
50,"Wow, what a great time!","My friend and i have wanted to go here for a long time and were not disappointed when we visited. You could probably walk through the place in an hour or so, but we stayed for about 3 hours looking at all the intersting items. The no cell phone policy is understandable due to the rarity of the items on display. The staff was very nice and helpful. They let me put my heavy tourist bag at the front desk which made it easier for me to be able to walk around longer. They have super cool merch and we bought some of that. This place is awesome and i would love to go back if i'm ever in the area again. Thanks for everything!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kalasaver
30,It All Depends on What You Expect,"I, personally, was disappointed because most of the items in there I had already seen through my own investigations and internet searches. I have a fascination with learning about serial killers and how their minds work, and with death itself so the pictures to me were not disturbing. It is a museum so there is a lot of reading and I did learn a thing or two so I didn't come away empty handed. But if you have a weak stomach, I do not suggest this for you. If you want to see crime scene photos, learn about serial killers, various burial rituals, how certain celebrities died, and cult mass suicides, then by all means this place is for you. It is a cramped space just in case you are claustrophobic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Phavored1
30,Disappointing,"I expected so much more.It should be named 4 cramped up rooms of death.Very small, everything is jumbled up. Some rooms had tv showing very old footage.$17 entrance fee not worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dxbdxb
20,A whole lot of nope,"I'm not sure what I expected really. I thought it would be more of a serial killer museum with artifacts and stuff. Although there was a lot of this there was also a lot of other more gruesome and mentally scarring stuff which I wasn't prepared for. i.e a video of a guy getting shot several times, half his face blown off and still alive for a few minutes after, photos of dead babies, photos of a death orgy where a couple of people chopped off a mans genitals and put it in his mouth etc etc, you get the message. I think you'd have to be pretty twisted to enjoy this stuff.I enjoyed the Manson family part, that's about it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HBRoxx
50,Mesmerizing!,"We decided to visit this place during my partner's first visit to LA. So glad we did! First greeted by a beautiful skull mural out front announcing the museum's location. Otherwise the building/location might look a bit off putting. Don't let this discourage you! Once inside, you agree to not take any photos. It's understandable as much of this stuff really should not be circulated on the internet. Plus they have cameras in every room watching you to make sure. A treasure trove of information about serial killers and death rituals. A room devoted to autopsies and another for taxidermy. What blew me away were the crime scene photos! Really crazy and macabre and fascinating. worth a visit for less than $20.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JessieB112277
50,Thoroughly engaging,"It’s well worth spending some time here, and it covers what every one of us will be subject to.Many aspects of ritual and ceremony surrounding peoples’ demise are shown. One of the most explicit segments concerns autopsies and their developments over time.Criminal deaths are a main feature and there are fascinating accounts of the most notorious mass-murders. The Charles Manson killings are given a whole room of videos and posters, outlining in detail the horrific events and their investigation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/permia
10,Awful!,Overpriced. People working there are unfriendly and rude. The place is dirty. Smells. Avoid this place like the plague!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JANE11112222
20,Has Potential,Went today and was left a bit disappointed. It has potential to be so much better. Lots of photos captured death but had no description of what we were looking at which left us a bit confused. The ones that did have descriptions weren’t written very well so hard to understand the story behind the picture to really educate about what we were looking at. If you just want to see pictures of the dead and not really interested in stories behind it you’ll like it but if you want to know more then you’ll be left disappointed. Has great potential if improvements are made. Don’t be disappointed if you don’t have time to get to this attraction.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nb5555
50,Macabre in capital letters!,"Fascinating both factually and disturbing manner. Being from the UK I've never been exposed to such graphic images but they have context and are respectful.Would recommend this musean if you fancy an alternative experience. Many different information sections, we easily spent several hours here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shallwegothere
30,Interesting but a little dated,"I visited on a whim and while the entry fee is a little steep it is Hollywood so nothing is cheap anyway.The museum is full of shock exhibits, it's mostly about horrific criminals, with around 40% being about actual death. It's still interesting and takes about an hour to go around.My only real issue is that it's fairly dated. Nothing is more modern than the late 1990s, with a lot of the focus being on serial killers from decades ago. While most of the names are still infamous, I'd have liked to have seen some more up to date exhibits.Maybe not an absolute must see in LA, but if you happen to walk by its worth a look.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fish_EDI
10,Overpriced mediocre and boring,Not worth $17 more like $5 its a small mediocre collection of death related things its boring overpriced and you would be better off going to a graveyard or taking a tour of a mourge,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MikeHuntSmellLikeFis
40,Excellent if you've ingested poison and need to induce vomiting!,"Not for the faint of heart, or faint of digestive juices. $17 entry fee seemed a bit steep initially, but while it's small, they pack a lot of bang for the buck in each small room, and it starts strong with the serial killers room (I didn't care however for the crass homophobic A-Z serial killer poems, though clearly from another era). I wasn't a fool and kept my phone concealed because dems the rules, but I did sneak a few photos of the shrunken heads, though the photos were fully blocked by the lining of my pants pocket.I was probably the only person there without goth/metal/punk attire, or a passion or even passing interest for true crime, cults or dead people. But if you have a crush on Charles Manson, morbid fascinations or are just a little sick in the head, this place will leave you happier than a pig in mud. You can watch live surgery and embalming on 1970s educational videos, look at gruesome crime scene photos and read about interesting patents for casket technology, my favorite of which was hands-down the anti-grave robber underground casket torpedo.After about 90 minutes of engorging my brain with bloody atrocities, sliced open human guts and some very cute Victorian child coffins, I left so dizzy and bewildered that I immediately stumbled from this museum onto a Hollywood celebrity tour, which was a pleasant reminder that someday they will also die. Would not do again but someday I will enthusiastically recommend this to my future 22-year old deadbeat son to get rid of him for a while.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/benofalltrades22
50,Intense. Don't be Fooled by the Other Reviews.,"We decided to do this museum to get us in the mood for Halloween. You will read a LOT of reviews on here that the employees are rude for kicking people out. These people are the problem, not the employees. You are told when you buy your ticket (which is a little pricey, but it is LA so not unexpected) that if you take photos you will be asked to leave, they tell you specifically that you can come in and out of the exhibit if you need to have your phone out to answer texts or calls. It is a pretty simple ask, and understandable as the material inside the exhibit is very sensitive. If people would listen to instructions and not act like they are above the rules, then they wouldn't be asked to leave.That being said. The museum is full of very interesting exhibits. You will see artifacts owned by serial killers, get an education on medical examination, and see an elephant skull in person, just to name a few things. It got a little gruesome for me, and I typically can handle a lot of gruesome. But worth the visit, in my opinion. Something you don't see every day, and a good way to spend a spooky October evening.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hannah-the-Brave89
20,Not worth a visit,"Cramped, poor lighting and not worth a visit. There is a lot of exhibits in a very small space, so much crammed into each case and so full of people you cant see a lot. Lighting is poor as reflects back off glass everywhere. Expensive for what it is",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B251GCclaired
20,IMO not worth it,"Well it’s $17 per ticket. In all honesty you could probably find on the internet the majority of the material they had displayed. In one room they had a video playing on a loop on procedures that a mortician would encounter during what I imagine is a usual scenario for the profession. Newspaper clippings of murders is several rooms and a room dedicated to animal taxidermy, I mean c’mon. I knew that it was going to be a bit ridiculous, so this was just confirmation. Save yourself the $17.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GrignardRxn
50,Interesting,"This place is very interesting, morbid but interesting for sure, gruesome but reality. It’s awesome you can take as much time as you to read & see everything because this place is packed from floor to ceiling. I wouldn’t recommend children go at all maybe teenagers? They tell you no photos no video no taking out your phone what so ever & warn you that they are watching you on camera, kinda creepy but I get it. I would recommend those that are curious to go see this place, we’re looking forward to seeing the one in New Orleans next! It’s unique, unusual, real & it teaches you about some history too. I’ll be back I’m sure we missed seeing something",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MalissaC26
40,Fascinating!,"Small but what is there is very interesting. My friends and I truly enjoyed ourselves. Lots of pictures, and ghoulish things to see. Will definitely recommend and visit again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Climber773426
50,Makes me glad I didn't go into law enforcement.,"This museum frankly makes me glad I didn't go through with my childhood wish to become a detective like my hero, Sherlock Holmes. Seeing the crime scene photos of people like Sharon Tate and Elizabeth ""The Black Dahlia"" Short made me queasy. And normally I'm made of sterner stuff but it just - got to me.One item I was fascinated with and wish I knew the story of is a bottle in the shape of a handgun filled with different locks of human hair. Were they mementos of dead family members? Cut from people shot by guns? Did it belong to a serial kill and these were his (or her) trophies?There were times I wanted to cry. A video played about the Holocaust in one room - how I'd love to lock some Holocaust deniers in there! - and I had to leave it because I could barely control how I felt knowing some of my relatives, whom I'll never get to know, went through that while others escaped, changed their names, and pretended to be Catholic in public while practicing their true religion in secret.In one way I'm sad I couldn't take pictures inside. I've been having trouble online with anti-vaxxers (they started attacking me over the fact I got the TDAP booster before the birth of my great nephew) and I would have dearly loved to have photographs of the tiny coffins for children and close ups of the photos of children who died before modern medicine such as vaccines and the vitamin K shot came along to send to them to let them know this is what their children will face if they don't wake up and vaccinate them.And I wouldn't have minded getting a shot of me flipping off a photo of monster Charles Manson, may he burn.But most of the items and photos are just too gruesome to allow on sites like Instagram and Facebook and it would be tasteless to photograph them.The Heaven's Gate room struck me as I'm old enough to remember when that happened.The taxidermied pets made me want to cry again. I can't imagine doing that to any of my dogs, past or present, and don't understand why anyone would. I keep the ashes of my Bitty, Audrey Rose, and Minnie The Moocher in nice boxes in my room.Whenever the subject of death comes up I tell people my first preference is to discover the secret to immortality. (That always upsets them. But I LIKE being alive, being able to touch, to taste, smell, hear - why would I want to give that up even if Heaven is real?) But otherwise I want to be mummified - preferably in such a way as my limbs would still be poseable so I can be dressed up for different displays and be known as The Cosplaying Mummy. Maybe, if I ever get around to writing a will, The Museum Of Death should be the place I choose for my body to end up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/697jamir
10,Ridiculously unprofessional,"I went to the museum with my friend and his girlfriend. We were told no pictures or video. We were barely into the first room when I got a text. I looked at my phone and this guy comes over and says no pictures you're out of here. I told him I wasn't taking pictures, I'm looking at a text, I'll show you my gallery. He then becomes incredibly rude and accusatory. He says again you have to go. My friend says well then you're giving us a refund since we haven't done anything wrong. He said you were told no pictures so you have to leave. I said you couldn't have seen me take pictures because I didn't take any. He was completely unprofessional. I started talking to another employee and asked who was in charge. Seems like nobody was so I never got to talk to anyone who could handle the situation professionally. I showed the 2nd employee my gallery on my phone. ZERO pictures from the museum. He was willing to let us back in but the 1st guy starts yelling at him ""I'm handling this and I'm kicking them out"". No refund, nothing. So if you want to spend your money where customer service is meaningless and you'll be treated poorly well then this is the place for you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JMoney24
50,Not for the faint of heart,"I would hesitate to recommend this museum to someone who is not interested in the morbid subject matter, but for those with interest, the collection here is extensive, eclectic, and often arranged in creative and interesting ways. It is clearly curated by someone who is deeply interested in the subject matter. Expect to easily spend an hour here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Q2465UIjohnm
10,DON'T GO!!! Heartlessly kicked out of the museum,Be forewarned that not only can you not take photos within this museum but you can not even bring your phone out FOR ANY REASON whatsoever or they kick you out WITHOUT A REFUND!!! My boyfriend and I and a friend entered only to be kicked out within the first minute just for pulling out a phone to make notes of the credit card transaction. Even after showing the man working there that there were no photos taken he REFUSED to let us continue thru and wouldn't give us a refund either. Highway robbery in my opinion and poor business practice. It is very evident that the employee who kicked us out took great pleasure in belittling us and the other employees present who tried to come to our aid but were ridiculed for doing so. Save yourself the headache and don't waste your money!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/247WorldTraveler
10,Terrible treatment of paying customers,"I decided to treat my friends to admission into the Museum of Death not knowing what to expect. After paying admission and being told that we couldn’t take pictures in the museum, the three of us entered the very first room only to be confronted aggressively by an employee for having a phone out. While I attempted to let the employee know that I only took my phone out to log the admission price transaction into the notes section of my phone(as I do for every purchase), the employee did not care to listen and told us that we all had to leave and that there would be no admission, or refund, despite not violating the verbal warning regarding photos we were given. After a second friend, and then subsequently another fellow employee tried to reason with him, he became hostile and escorted us out of the building keeping our money. After explaining it was a simple mistake and suggesting that if we took our phone out again we would leave with no questions asked, the employee raised his voice and began shouting at and berating us in front of all of the other customers. It seems to be a business practice that this museum likes to employ. Take your money, then find an excuse to kick you out with no refund, despite having seen almost none of the museum itself. This is not a review of the merits of the museum, since we weren’t allowed to see it, despite being paying customers, this is simply a warning of the type of business that is run, the type of people employed, and the type of scam they seem to be running.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/craigwY9126KE
50,It's Ecactly What It Says!,"As a true crime nut, I was really looking forward to seeing this museum but was also worried it wouldn't be worth the entrance fee. It totally was worth it! I learned a lot about things I thought I already knew, and heard tales of things I hadn't known about at all.It gets heavy at times and I think I lost a little of my innocence, but what did I expect from The Museum Of Death.The fellows running it that day were so kind and cool and were concerned that we enjoyed it. We did! Thank you both!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zeddemore
50,Amazing for ADULTS.,"The weirdo in me really enjoyed this, especially as I missed my chance to go to their sister museum in NOLA. I honestly could’ve stayed for hours. The admission price is $17, which felt like a bit much but it was worth it for me. For my family? Not so much. Both mother and brother left after probably 10 minutes, they had gone through 2 or 3 rooms “in the time it took [for me] to take a step”, per my brother. The first room? Serial killer artwork and personal belongings. Honestly it goes up from there. My family couldn’t do it, but for me, it’s a full 5 stars. Please don’t bring your kids, though - I saw a few and they didn’t look pleased, neither did some of the adults. There’s a bench outside the door if you need it. Also, it’s not the best accessibility wise, with stairs leading up and then cramped aisles. You’re basically in a claustrophobic, cramped space - but it was so worth it for me, even with the clutter.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elizamarsh
50,Cool museum,"I really liked the serial killer rooms, a lot of intresting stuff there! The other room were interesting too, but the crime part was my favorite",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elisabethrB2220SQ
50,Amazing for the weirdos who are interested in gore and serial killers,This was such a fun place to visit - a highlight of my trip to Los Angeles. It was not just a place to look at memorabilia but a place of knowledge and insight. It was exceptionally intriguing yet informative. The information on display ranged from taxidermied animals to autopsy videos to serial killer memorabilia. I saw people skim through it and they are probably the ones who are to write bad reviews but if you actually take your time and read and soak up the information on display it is absolutely exceptionally. Better than the information you can find online. Also the man that was working was really fun and interesting and you could tell he really liked his job. Whenever someone mentions they are visiting LA I without fail beg them to visit the Museum of Death.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ellamareep
10,Only for true gore and serial killer fans - others beware.,"This is the kind of museum that will have some people excited and others deeply disturbed for the exact same reasons, so ultimately it's up to you to think about what your experience will be and if you want to support a museum like this. I study dead people and their bodies for my research so I'm not exactly squeamish, but I found myself firmly in the disturbed camp. With that out of the way: the museum is a poorly curated collection of drawings, notes, and newspaper clippings that seem to mostly glorify serial killers; crime- and accident-scene photos that show the severed heads and mutilated bodies of people who died violent deaths not that long ago; video about autopsies with the volume turned down low so that instead of the actual original function of the video (teaching people how autopsies are conducted and why), you're in a room of people gawking at a corpse with its chest cavity spread open and organs being pulled out. There are also some sections on historical and crosscultural approaches to death, but unfortunately the signs and other information are very sparse (most of the texts seem to focus on murderers' MOs instead) so you don't learn very much from them. My fellow visitor described the museum's attraction as ""The same thing that attracts you to poke at roadkill as a child - 'now poke there - eww!'"" which I think is not inaccurate.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ellie734
30,Interesting,"$17.00 per person admittance fee. It took about 45 minutes to go through. It was a bunch of rooms divided into different sections. Funereal, serial killer, autopsy etc. There were many letters and art work of ""famous"" murderers to look at. It is sad how desensitized we are to see pictures of dead, bloodied bodies anymore. If you are queasy this may not be a place for you to visit.(Christa)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidjensen399
30,Visited while pregnant,"I’m not sure if I should have skipped this. I did watch horror films but during pregnancy I was a bit more sensitive, especially to smell too. There was a strange stench so I had to cover my nose with my clothes throughout most of the visit. It also got very crowded on the Saturday afternoon, and some hallways were very narrow, so at times it was difficult to look at the exhibits without blockage. I made it out of the exit in about half an hour, and saw a really long line queueing to go in. One advice is probably avoid weekends and bring a mask if u are sensitive to smell.Anyway, some of the photographs were quite graphic. I didn’t want to look at them too much. Many of the stories were written in small font placed at foot level (?!) or in a printed book so it’s actually not easy to read them. However I felt sad for the victims that their photographs were displayed this way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yohfng
50,Amazing collection!,"The hubs has a modest collection of serial and spree killer memorabilia of his own and was eager to check out this Museum’s array of reminders of humanity’s end game. We thoroughly enjoyed perusing the many rooms paying homage to Death as well as chatting with the knowledgeable staff about the collection. This Museum is not for the squeamish but is a must-see for adults with more than a passing interest in psychology, science, physics, history, and celebrity.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MF701
30,Very Interesting Museum,"I originally found this place doing an online search for things to do during our trip. I found a coupon at our hotel, so we decided to go. I, personally, love this type of stuff so I thoroughly enjoyed it. The museum is small but there is a lot to see. It was really interesting to me but may not be good for someone squeamish or easily grossed out. Everything is related to death so, as expected, some of the pictures and displays are very graphic. I would definitely check this out again. It's worth mentioning....there is no photography allowed inside of the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sugar04
10,Sickening...,"We went as a group of four and were so excited to check off the Museum of Death from our bucket lists.After paying $17USD, we walked through a cramped space to find serial killer archives which was pretty interesting and an impressive collection of paintings/drawings and letters done by killers in prison etc.Unfortunately It all goes down hill from there.. This museum is basically just a few rooms filled with disgusting photos of victims of murder, crashes and suicide.The photographs depicting dead babies, victims of murder being dismembered and violated by their attackers and the mutilated, naked and sodomised corpses of unsolved murders were extremely disturbing, not just because of what was shown but the complete disrespect for the victim and loved ones to show them in such an awful and degrading way simply to satisfy the morbid curiosity of strangers and to exploit the horrifying end to their lives in an effort to make money.Part of me suspects the museum doesn’t allow photographs taken as if the victims families were to ever find out they had the photos on display, they would be looking at some extreme law suits.We managed to get through the entire museum, all under the same impression of the museum glorifying serial killers and murderers and showing no respect for the deceased while exploiting them for profit.All four of us see death and tragedy on a daily basis for work and do not have squeamish stomachs whatsoever, but this museum left us all sick to our stomachs and feeling sorry for the victims that have been so disrespectfully displayed like a piece of art.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/465nikkia
50,Must See for Thrill Seekers,"Co-worker told me about it so we visited while in L.A. for work. I personally love small, unique museums. This place is very morbid. But if you are intrigued by these types of things it definitely is a must see for you then. The collection is put together very well. Some parts are harder to view than others but it all depends on the spectator. Definitely a unique experience and in the end happy I visited. Not for children or anyone sensitive to this type of macabre. Affordable as well and easy to find.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/972lisaf
40,Worth a visit,Not really kid friendly (thank god) but full of interesting exhibits. There is some pretty disturbing stuff crammed in to this small museum. Certainly worth a visit,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PeteSheringham
50,A well curated morbid collection,"I could’ve easily spent a solid 3-5 hours in the Museum of Death - for a relatively small space there is so much to pore over! The museum is sectioned off into subject areas: serial killers, executions, war, suicide, famous premature deaths, cannibalism, shrunken heads, taxidermy and animal death, and more. There are items owned by and correspondence from infamous serial killers. It’s a well curated collection of everything morbid and murderous.It’s fascinating but VERY graphic so I don’t recommend bringing any children under the age of 15, as there are loads of crime scene photos and specimens in jars.The staff are delightful and “have a nice life!” is such a great touch. They have a great line of merch/gifts too: T-shirt’s, hoodies, mugs, magnets, pins, postcards, and real specimens.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Janelledazzlepants
30,Too much stuff ruins the experience,"I’m a truecrime binge watcher so I had high expectations for this museum.The collection of stuff is impressive - but it’s just too much... stuff. The walls are filled with newspaper clips, photos, drawings etc. and at least for me it was hard to make any sense of it. I’d appreciated less items and a more organized layout with a clear order in what to read/watch. Less information had given me a fuller experience.The space is quite small and you’d have trouble navigating with a wheelchair. It’s also quite hot inside and I got a bit overwhelmed by the heat in combination with the graphic content.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/176helena_
40,A well put together collection but NOT for kids or the faint hearted!,The owner has really put a lot of thought and effort into this collection! Some really interesting stuff and some terrifying windows into the human psyche! I wouldn’t however take any children under the age of 16 or even 18 due to the really graphic nature of the pictures and videos of mutilation/decapitation. But it’s an interesting take on a subject we will all face eventually!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chris2pherharrison10
40,"Not for Everyone, But That's Not a Surprise","Really liked the look of this, as i'm quite interested in serial killers and things that are a bit 'different'. I was a bit scared, if i'm honest, as I visited alone as part of a family trip to LA, as it's obviously not suitable for children. The entrance price was reasonable and there were around 1-2 hours of exhibits to view. The first room, featuring letters and artwork from famous serial killers was really interesting, as was how death is celebrated in other countries (e.g. Dia de los Muertos in Mexico) was also fascinating, but some of the other rooms featuring mostly just photos of people killed in car accidents and murders, were too much. Saying that, it is something very different, which appeals to the dark side of human nature, but it's certainly not everyone! It makes you appreciate life, that's for sure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jalapenojo
30,"Average museum, but nothing much fascinating to me","Average museum, but nothing much fascinating to meWill be good to visit if you have time on hand. cos the location is pretty convenient in Hollywood area",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bennyvectra
10,Different but kinda much,"If you're like me and you're looking for something different and exciting, this may or may not be for you. ""Not for the faint hearted"" had me fooled, it's way more serious than that - images of actual, real injuries, videos of actual death AND THE SMELL, uh(combinations of carpet and no windows). That was one sick afternoon, afterwhich I just wanted to stand in the sun (no gift-shopping for me, not celebrating serial killers).So, if you're curious, be aware that you might end up not liking it, and you can leave in the middle (I stayed till the ended and did not enjoy it).Would have preferred reading the horror stories with no images and a feeling of glorified serial killers, which is at least how it felt like for me.Prices - single entry 17$, if you pay with credit card it's any extra 1$ - big bags are left with the crew at the entrance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/miryeh
40,Interesting museum not for the faint of heart,"I am a true crime lover and I was curious about this spot while visiting Los Angeles.

50,A must see!,"As someone who is fascinated with true crime, serial killers, etc., this place did not disappoint! Each room was filled with something to see! The guys at the front desk were also super friendly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/coley303
50,A must see for those of us who find death and anything that goes with it interesting!,"My friend and I arrived late on in the evening, after a long day on a tour busWe were made very welcome by the guys working there, they said we could ask any questions etcIt is such an amazing place and such a privilege to have goneIt was always on our list of thing to do when we got to America from the UKAnd it’s safe to say we were not disappointedThe Monitor playing a video of a post Mortum and embalming was a little too much for my friend!!! But we found the whole place and exhibits fascinatingIf you have the stomach for it please goI cant remember the fee to get in but it wasn’t expensive and personally I would have paid double",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FRONTSTER
50,Death on Hollywood Blvd.,"Being a an avid true crime follower and podcaster when I visited Los Angeles I knew I had to stop at The Museum of Death.Our first day of our trip my friends and I got dropped off in front of the museum and it was daunting to see from the outside. After convincing my one friend who was nervous about going inside we paid the admission fee and began our experience.The collection ranged from grotesque to informative and I was blown away by some of the items on display. The skull collection was impressive to say the least.I bought a few t-shirts and pins to bring home for my friends and spoke to the staff and they were all friendly and helpful.If you have any interest in the grotesque and macabre, this is a must visit in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DoctaWhom
50,Not for the faint hearted,I am a big fan of horror movies and death scenes in particular and was not fearful of what I might see. There are several real photographs and evidence from crime scenes and it wasn’t pleasant to see these things. It was interesting to see letters and other things some notorious serial killers wrote or made in jail. Again although interesting there were a few moments I felt I needed to take a minute and try not to freak out about what I was looking at as these are real life images not movies or photoshopped images online. Overall I am glad I visited. My teenage son wanted to visit and I am glad I chose not to let him come along. Staff was very nice and informative. There’s even a little gift shop. After visiting here I feel my views on death have changed and I appreciate life a lot more.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marsbar112
50,A must see when in Hollywood for the gore hound in us all!,"I just love this place to death, every pun intended!! Every visit I make there is something new to enthral and disgust in equal proportions. As a gore hound it shows the seedy side of life to perfection. They have a tremendous gift shop where year on year I spend a fortune!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vegas-Queen666
40,Interesting but not for the weak stomached,"True to its name, the museum covers serial killers, famous murders, suicides, funeral homes, autopsies and rituals related to death. Please do not bring your kids along here... Some folks brought their kids and even the museum employees thought that was a bad idea.Some images may make you feel nauseous :) Photography is thankfully not allowed otherwise people would be taking really inappropriate selfies.It is a well arranged museum except for the one image I saw of the goddess Kali.. I'm not sure why it was in the same gallery as serial killers who decapitated people - she is not a goddess of death and the heads she carries are of ""demons"". She's more of a fierce mother who protects her children, and she is worshipped by billions in India, so yes I did not find that too appropriately placed. It did not have any explanation either, unlike the lovely exhibit they have for the Day of the Dead.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NidhiC_12
40,Serial Killers!!,"Surprised my wife with a visit here while in LA, and she loved it! If you love watching crime shows and ID investigate non stop, you will love it too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/285ethanc
40,Interesting but disturbing,"This is not your light, fun touristy museum. This is very real information and displays about death that will leave you disgusted and reflective. There are crime scene and death pictures that are graphic. You don't leave with a sense of ""that was fun!"" but more of a feeling that you've been informed of some of the evils of the world and the reality of dying. There's also an appreciation of the people that work in professions facing this daily.Plan to spend around an hour there. It is interesting if you can stomach the graphic details and pictures of death. Some videos you can also watch. No Hollywood fluff here. Very Real.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Treyab73
50,Unique Experience,"The Museum of Death is not playing, you will be intrigued. Disturbing but true, this visit upped my intelligence of unfortunate and untimely deaths - but instilled respect of those who lost their lives to dark individuals. Subject very well presented and very well preserved. Not a ""Hokey Hollywood"" museum, many incidents I was aware of - and many not, truly done in good taste and was glad to have taken the time to understand more fully events that have shaped our history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BeBiggerThanAZipCode
40,Awesome visit wasn't expecting it,"The museum is awesome I wasn't expecting to visit something like that, I walked by it and got curious.Was wort it, they dont allow pictures inside the museum but they have rooms and rooms full of death objects and stories that are worth visit and a look.very recommended if you are in hollywood area",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/reviews506
50,Not for the faint hearted!,"Museum of Death - I read all of the reviews but still wanted to visit. I was pretty nervous about what I might see, but there was something intriguing & I enjoyed visiting the museum more than i should have...Very strict no photos policy & you must leave backpacks at the door.There is a strange smell that lingers in the air as you wander round the museum looking at all of the newspaper cuttings & artefacts. The museum itself is not very big but there is lots to see. Some of the photos were horrific. But i found them all fascinating - having never seen anything quite like this before.I was amazed by the photos of the shootings & the devastation caused by these acts of violence. I wonder if photos like these were put on general release, if it might go someway to reducing the amount of gun crime? Until you see a photo of a corpse with a bullet that has ripped through it you don't realise the mess it makes.A fascinating place to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bl0ndie72
40,Grim... But that's what you want.,"This is a museum collection of death, it ain't no jolly. The images, stories and artifacts can fill you full of dread. If you enjoy exhibitions of this nature, pop along, if not move along... Oh and no pictures!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chuckofcorby
40,Lots to see,"If you spend the time reading all the signs and learning about the exhibits then it's worth the money. If you skip through without stopping to read, then it would be over pretty quickly. Some rather gruesome photos and exhibits - but I guess that's the attraction.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nz_travels_a_lot_08
50,A must see!,"I was really looking forward to this place and it didnt disappoint. It had so much more than I expected from serial killer documents, crime scene photos and items from cults...this place had me looking everywhere trying to take it all in.I do only recommend this if you have a good stomach as some of the photos are pretty extreme. No photos are allowed which is understandable considering the content and the tshirts they have for sale are really cool too",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E3936BXkyleh
50,"If you're into weird stuff, you'll love this","As someone who is into all things creepy or weird, the Museum of Death was a must-visit for me when we went to LA. It's exactly what you'd expect plus a lot more. They have anything you could think of related to death and dying as a subject, presented as respectfully as possible. We spent about an hour and a half there and felt it was plenty of time.Some of the included items include serial killer artwork, a real electric chair, an assortment of various caskets, items from mass suicides by cults, shrunken heads, taxidermy, and anything else you can think of. The place is seriously packed with items, many that will make you think ""...how did they get this?"" This is definitely a museum for a very niche interest and NOT for everyone - if you are at all triggered by death or suicide this is not the place for you. But if you've got a strong stomach and an interest in ""weird stuff"" - I'd give it a chance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kaelaceleste
30,Pretty cool,"If your into this sort of thing, its pretty cool. It is not for the faint of heart and 100% is not for children. Its very large, someone could easily spend hours reading and looking at everything inside. Bring cash to pay or they will charge you a fee.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Killer505
20,Parts of it were interesting...but others parts went WAY too far,"Had I actually known what was in the museum I wouldn’t have gone. I thought it would mainly have items related to killers, but not the victims. I found the serial killer rooms fascinating...all the letters and drawings made by the most notorious killers out there. I didn’t have much interest in taxidermy or embalming...but that’s just me but I thought it was an appropriate exhibit.All that being said, I found all the photos of the victims were inappropriate and shouldn’t be on display for a bunch of us to look at them in this manner. These poor victims were already murdered and now we are revictimizing them by putting them on display and showing them in such a vulnerable position. They have already suffered tremendously and to make them suffer through the indignity of a bunch of looking-loos examining their final photos seems like the penultimate abuse. I view autopsy photos through my day job and we always show this type of evidence our upmost respect (so it’s not that I can’t handle seeing these types of photos). I really don’t care that the museum is putting the killers on display (they lost their right to privacy when they committed the heinous acts) but the poor victims didn’t.I think if they removed the photos of the victims - this would be an interesting place to visit. However, the way that it is now can’t allow me to recommend this place to others.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/airykah
50,"Interesting, cool! Pit stop on a long layover","Made a visit on a long layover. Staff (Oscar) was wonderful & very helpful! Very interesting items, displays. Not for everyone but worth a visit! Thanks Oscar!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MonicaM3506
30,Collection of murder memorabilia,"This place is essentially a massive private collection of photos, newspaper clippings and artefacts relating to murders. It includes a lot of very confronting photos of bloodied/damaged dead bodies at murder scenes, miscarried foetuses in jars, coffins and plenty of items belonging to serial killers. It also has video footage of people being shot and decapitated. This would be of great interest to many people but it is not an educational museum which explores concepts or rituals relating to death, and it definitely not for the faint-hearted or those who don’t cope with really gory images. It is very much themed around murderers/victims.it is made up of small, stuffy rooms with a strange smell and these rooms are quite cluttered, but there is a lot of stuff on display so could take an hour or two to read everything if you were interested in all the clippings. We spent about half an hour browsing before I couldn’t handle any more. I wouldn’t take a child there but adults with an interest in serial killers will find this a treasure trove of information and worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AngusMilly
40,"Interesting, and not to be taken lightly...It's a whole lot of death in one building","Ok, so I have been contemplating how to properly review the museum. It is truly a 'one of a kind' experience... not to be taken lightly, or for those squeamish, or sensitive to the whole subject of death. This is NOT a house of horrors where things jump out at you, or like that. It is a serious museum of artifacts, history, and oddities. We probably spent over 90 minutes here. There is a whole lot of reading to be done if you want to actually learn something. The photos and articles are quite graphic. I didn't have any issue with the graphic nature of the museum, but what sticks with me, is how truly deranged and terrible we as humans are to each other. I think most people probably come here 'on a dare' with their friends... I say, take the time to actually think, and learn from what is being presented.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dragonfly972
50,Very interesting,"Off the bat it’s not for everyone. It’s a very particular, very niche kind of material.But it is very interesting, they have a lot of material, a lot of really exclusive, special things.If you are in any way interested in creepy, horror, scary real life death, you will enjoy it. It’s very detailed and a good use of the time for anyone interested in the subject.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/snowweisz
30,Visit to feel that you are still alive,"I wouldn't recommend this museum as part of Los Angeles tour, there are far more interesting places. Besides, there are a lot of homeless people in this neighborhood.However if you feel stuck or very upset with your life, you can go here to get a push, to feel released that you are still alive and your problems are something you can deal with.17$ admission, parking lot nearby - 10$ parking fee. Free parking is very limited.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/priesta2015
20,If your employees have a crappy attitude it doesn't matter if you have a good Museum,"They oversell you on the museum, with warnings of fainting, dizzy spells, vomiting, etc etc. The Museum was Sup par. I can see why they ban any cellphones or photos. If people could look online and see how underwhelming the museum was no one would come in. If you enjoy being crammed into a small building with only one way in/out elbow to elbow with other people you may enjoy yourself. The guy behind the counter was cocky and condescending He was very annoyed that pulled out exact tender from my wallet and counted it to make sure I handed him the right amount, he told me people like me are the ones who become victims. any question he was asked by anyone was responded to with sarcasm, and the attitude that he was doing everyone who came in a big favor by allowing them to enter the museum. If your employees have a crappy attitude it doesn't matter if you have a good Museum",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/14meshaw
10,No where to park,"I really wish I could have seen the inside of the Museum of Death, we’ve been waiting months. But with a major lack of parking, we couldn’t find a place to safely put our rental car so we could venture inside. So I guess I’ll review the entrance and parking lot.After making an illegal u-turn in the middle of Hollywood Blvd (because we missed the entrance the first time around) we pulled into a very narrow, short alley that led to a small parking lot. The museum only has 3 parking spaces while their neighboring building has I think around 6. I had to make a 12 pt turn to turn around and attempt to find street parking. I asked a man walking through the lot where else I could park, he said on the street behind the lot where the church is. So out and around we went. Of course there was still no place to park and then to make matters worse, there were about 6 tents set up on the sidewalk in which the homeless occupied. We gave up.I guess if you want to see it, maybe a weekday morning at opening is your best bet or taking Uber or Lyft.We don’t fly to LA often so I’m not sure when we’ll have the opportunity to enjoy this museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Getawaywhenwecan
40,From George Vreeland Hill,"Very cool if you are interested in this sort of thing.The museum has a lot of items about dying and death.You will get a pretty good history lesson here as it covers death over the years.Lots of things from serial killers too.Good staff.The only reason I am not giving the Museum of Death five stars is because they won't let you take photos.Come on guys, this is Hollywood.Let cameras in.George Vreeland Hill",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeorgeVreelandHill
40,Very interesting place,My daughter really wanted to come to see this museum. It was very interesting. Lots of really good items from many different serial killers and some fantastic picture from old collision scenes. Staff was super helpful and extremely friendly. They don’t just work there they are very involved in the process. A really good educational experience. Really glad we made the trip.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robertc641
10,"If you have a death fetish, you'd like it. Otherwise, don't expect to learn anything.","This place is, essentially, the poorly curated collection of someone who has a death and gore fetish. The serial killer room is knick knacks and doodads that were once owned by serial killers, along with photos of some of their victims. Paintings by John Wayne Gacy and action figures of others. The only ""information"" that might actually teach you anything is basically the printout of a Wikipedia entry. There's a wall of car accident photos from the 1950s and photos of people being headed in China. There's a corner devoted to the Black Dahlia murder, which was pretty much just a photo of her corpse. No context, little history.If you think for five seconds that the museum might explore death rituals from cultures around the world, or perhaps have a section discussing afterlife myths, then save yourself those five seconds. This is a ""museum"" dedicated to the pop-culturification of death or at least gory subject matter. From movie posters to schlock TV shows to tabloid magazines.Most of the guests were goth teens and twenty somethings dressed in black giggling at the displays. I'm not kidding. Your $17 is better spent being given to the half dozen homeless people littering the street just outside who look like they could be on display inside.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/molacde
40,Creepy but so interesting,"This place left me feeling both very intrigued and a little sickened. I would say overall I was completely fascinated by the exhibits and the articles! Some of the photos are obviously disturbing, but admittedly that is the point.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zonadl
40,"A bit unsettling, but worth it","The museum has a vast collection of all things.. well.. death! When you walk in, you are greeted by friendly staff members, who give you plenty of fair warning about the contents of the museum. Walking into the first room, we saw the artwork and drawings of some of the most notorious serial killers of our time, including John Wayne Gacy among others.As you make your way through the tiny, cramped spaces more and more gore and death is presented. It becomes a bit overwhelming once in a while, and there was a certain feeling that some of it was displayed simply for shock value. And it is quite horrific, make no mistake. But other things on display such as the letters from prison written by Jeffery Dahmer before his death were quite interesting.All in all, it is a very good collection, but don't think you're not going to see some stuff!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dan1724
50,"Off the beaten path, but worth it.",We stumbled on this while in Hollywood. It was very interesting and different. If you’re into the darker side of things (and not squeamish) I would definitely go. It might be disturbing for some that are sensitive to graphic images. We dug it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/171tarat
40,80% graphic photos of the deceased,"Tickets for entry are $17 cash, $1 surcharge to use a debit/credit card. There’s a parking lot in the back of the building although spots are limited if it’s busy. No photography/texting/phone calls are allowed inside the museum. The museum itself isn’t very big but the majority of their displays are extensive graphic photos of dead people. This place is not for the faint of heart. They have artwork from John Wayne Gacy, a hallway of photographs of carwrecks with dead bodies inside the vehicles, baby coffins, a Mason room filled with artifacts and a taxidermy room. I thought this museum was going to be mostly about information on serial killers, etc. but it was 80% very graphic photos of dead and murdered people. If you can’t handle gore I wouldn’t recommend going here. They also have a gift shop in the front entrance where you purchase tickets and where the museum exits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jackielO4322BC
20,Nothing special,"I was really excited to visit this ""museum"", as I am fascinated by serial killers and crazy people in general. I would not recommend visiting this attraction. It was small, cramped, and I didn't find the exhibits very informative, creative, or interesting. Also, the price was steep given the quality of the experience. I remain disappointed :(",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/955michaelan
50,Different to the very last step!,Despite the title this is not a gratuitous place! Well set out in limited space. A lot of pictures/photos that you have probably often wondered what they look like! Interesting write ups with all exhibits.Very much worth a visit. Takes about 60/90 mins,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KathyCliff
30,Some Fascinating Bits - some Utterly Gratuitous Gore,"Some of this museum is great - interesting, informative and fascinating. The Serial Killers Art work and correspondence was a highlight. However, I felt that many of the subsequent images were placed more to shock than inform. There were a few that were utterly disrespectful to the victims shown. Im not squeamish, so although many images were gory thats to be expected, what put me off was the sensationalist nature of some of the images.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/683caroll
50,A magical place,"First, I do not have any type of social media and so did not feel inclined to take any pictures while I was here but after reading the reviews about how people who did choose to take one were treated I am appalled. Dont be a Sh**head to people. If you are running a museum or otherwise. And that poor tortoise! However, I am not writing about their experience there but mine. So for me I came here after taking a murder tour as suggested by our tour guide. Also an aside, I know A LOT about the American murderer especially serial killers. This was actually the topic of my masters' thesis which was chosen for a symposium conducted with the top thesis of that year. So naturally I was fascinated. Seeing Gacy's clown shoes and Richard Ramirez's intake form where he answered ""a unicorn"" when asked if he could be any animal what would he be were pure joy. The heaven's gate room and electric chair complete with death clothes were mesmerizing. Also- dont they have these murder t shirts for sale in their gift shop. I wish I collected them all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Therese_Piece
40,"No Cell Phones!! (So, don’t even try!)","This is prob the only down side (and they have camera everywhere, and staff will come out and ask you to put away your phone if you even take it out), but there’s so much to read and to look at it, it’s nice not feeling obligated to photograph everything. There’s everything death-related on view at this museum, from serial killers to cannibals, body parts in jars, coffins, and SO many macabre photographs (some of which are extremely graphic, so don’t look too closely if you have a weak stomach). We weren’t looking to see the typical tourist attractions, so this seemed like a good choice. The $17 admission fee seemed a little steep, but there is A LOT on view, so much that the space doesn’t seem large enough to fit it all WITH visitors looking at it, just take your time walking through and don’t miss the Siamese turtles in the tank on your way out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lifebyangelina
40,Not for the faint of heart,"I was recommended he Museum of Death by a friend and recently made a visit with my boyfriend while in Hollywood. The museum begins with artwork and letters from various serial killers. I particularly enjoyed the paintings of John Wayne Gacy, as I work in behavioral health and have an arts background.As the museum continues, the content becomes more graphic with pictures of killings, suicides, and mutilated bodies. I was fascinated by the mortician area where a video played of how to embalm a body.I would say if your the slightest bit squeamish then this museum is not for you. There were many graphic photos that may cause some to feel faint. I would definitely not recommend this museum to anyone under the age of 18.I would have given the museum 5 stars but I found it difficult to fully observe all the content as three was so much packed into a small venue.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maryoliviaj
40,It really should be called Museum of Killings,"More than a museum devoted to all things related to death, the Museum of Death is, in actuality, more akin to a Museum of Killings, with about 75-80% of the place devoted to serial killers, mass murderers, and the like. The collection here has some interesting artifacts, such as original letters from serial killers while they were imprisoned, televised interviews with people associated with the Manson murders, memorabilia from various funeral homes, and some embalming-related equipment.As other visitors have noted, parts of this museum are truly gruesome, and this is NOT a place for children or teenagers and it is NOT a place for the feint of heart. My partner actually became woozy as a result of a video showing people having their legs chopped off by guerillas, and even fainted twice during our visit. (The guy at the front desk said to us that this happens an average of once or twice a week, and that is not at all surprising to me.)There were numerous interesting things to see and read about in this museum, along with many grim and disgusting things too (e.g., actual autopsy footage, photographs of severed body parts). If killings and death are your thang, then this is the place for you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/187hughk
10,There are much more you can spent time and money.,Go there only if you occupied with suicidal thoughts to see the ugly dead pictures. You may change your mind. Otherwise you will leave disappointed. A very small museum with a lot of graphic pictures and minimum to nothing exhibit. Ticket price is hight satisfaction is in negative scale. I will recommend to everybody to AVOID going there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oxanau
50,Death journey,"The ticket is 17 bucks, it's totally worth it. It might be a bit scary if you are afraid of bloody pictures..

10,We were savagely kicked out of the Museum of Death.,"Be sure to listen carefully to the receptionist’s nonchalantly delivered instructions of not taking photos LEST YOU FORGET and want to be callously frogmarched out of this museum and spat out onto the pavement.We went here and mindlessly forgot about the instructions of no photo-taking once we’d reached the third room of the exhibition. We took a quick irrelevant snap of one of us in the mirror of a coffin and the worker took it as his moment to catch the big fish.He seemed to take an unsettling pleasure in marching over and telling us to get out, dismissing all apologies we were desperately issuing for having forgotten. He displayed not a morsel of human compassion, which seemed slightly strange considering he worked at the Museum of Death where he would have had an educated understanding of the extent to which humans stray in the realm of morality and rule-breaking, this in relative terms seemed something of an overreaction...He escorted us out most humiliatingly through the visitors of the museum and proudly presented his findings like a cat with a dead bird to his owner, to the receptionist who had issued the original BINDING instruction.The receptionist smiled a rather frightening flash of a smile upon hearing how one of the details in his casually delivered opening monologue had been perfidiously disrespected.There was an unmissable delectation being derived from the requital being served.We clumsily, embarrassedly and profusely apologised as he slung our bags over the counter at us, which we’d been told to leave at reception. At which point he delivered his humdinger of a speech, like a judges final adjudication:“Maybe you forgot, maybe you didn’t listen, or MAYBE THERE IS SOME INCONSIDERATION IN YOUR SPIRIT” which was rather severe. We couldn’t believe it.The two of them seemed pleased that they had caught the Vile Villains of the Museum of Death and chucked us out with what we imagined, a side smile, rubbing their hands under the counter with glee.We walked out ashamed, defeated and shocked while passing the THREE-HEADED TORTOISE on the way out, who was trapped in an eternity of hell, inside a cage they had kept him in where the poor animal couldn’t move forward, sideways or backwards in what looked like a lot of distress and pain.Interesting that photo-taking was ungodly and yet using a struggling animal living in a deep hell of an existence in captivity as their Opening Sight to welcome guests went unchallenged.The chief of the operation (the receptionist) couldn't help himself but to shout after us in our final part of our mortifying walk of shame out of their bizarre museum with a caustic remark: “AND PEOPLE SAY AMERICANS ARE RUDE”, his obvious point being that us Brits had brought the reputation of our nation down with what we had done, and as ambassadors for our country had proven how wrong “They” (whoever They are) were.Because we were the worst.It was a savage ejection and I’ve never been thrown out of a museum before.If you ever go to this museum run by maniacs who WILL GET YOU IF YOU CROSS THEM, be sure to listen to the rules and don’t slip up or RETRIBUTION WILL BE DONE.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NateBaylass
40,TIP: Opens at 10. Go then to avoid the crowds!!,"The Museum of Death is an interesting 'alternative' attraction in Hollywood. Suitably to indulge one's morbid sense of curiosity: if you are squeamish this place is NOT for you!I would really reccomend going as soon as the place opens (10am). It appears to gets quite a lot of visitors and as the building is quite small and enclosed it would very easily get cramped, with lots of people getting in each other's way. I would suggest maybe visit mid week rather than weekends also.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/df86
50,If you're into death...,"Interesting place if you're into death (which is why I went). Great display of serial killer biographies and correspondence, including artwork. An entire room devoted to embalming and funeral homes, coffins, etc. I agree with others that things could have been organized a little differently. Some rooms were too crowded with info and artifacts, but my sister and I loved it.If you like this, go to the Dearly Departed Tours on Santa Monica Blvd and for $5, you can go into their museum. It's great!! And when we were on their tour, we went past the Museum of Death and the guide gave the museum a nice shout out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoanRN_48

I was holding it together until I entered the ""sample room"", where maybe something wasn't preserved quite enough. Too crowded even though they try to thin the line. Definitely stuck with me, and hard to shake off. Seriously, be prepared to see the things you can't unsee. Cameras/photos are not allowed, hopefully for the respect of those who have passed in these horrific manners. And a little ""Faces of Death"" on your way out. Never again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jennmGR8adventure

Several exhibits stick out to me like the shrunken head of a serial killer, LA County Corner's stretcher that carried thousands of bodies in a few years of service, a collection of hand-written and hand-made letters/items from serial killers like the Killer Clown and Manson, and actual items from the Heaven's Gate Cult. The tour takes you about 1-3 hours depending on how much you can take in all at once. At the end upon walking out of the maze of hallways and rooms onto the hustle and bustle streets of LA, you are left with a surreal moment that you are grateful to be alive, yet fully aware of mortality. I was left with a heavy sense or burden that quickly went away upon visiting the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels! Please note, at the time of my visit, NO PHOTOS are permitted while on tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChristopherF2352
40,Interesting but scary as well,"This is a great museum, the owner are nice. You cant bring you backpack inside but you can leave it with the owner. One more thing no phots inside. Ps this museum is interesting but it might be too intense for someone though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/minmintt
40,Unique & Then Some,"My daughter who is fascinated with crime stories and horror movies chose to come here for her birthday and so I brought her and two of her friends (17 & 18 year olds). They absolutely loved it. I’m not really into the whole death genre but did find the museum to be a unique collection of items. The entrance fee is $15 a person and it is likely you’ll spend about 45 minutes to an hour in the place. The rooms are small and the walkways narrow so at times it was hard to really get a good look at stuff ‘cause it was really busy on a Saturday afternoon. They do let you stay as long as you want though so you just have to wait for the crowd to pass. They also don’t allow any photographs to be taken. The first room you enter has artwork and letters from serial killers. Each room seems to have a theme and there’s lots of items to look at including photos of crime scenes and horrific accidents. There’s a room filled with taxidermy and the last room has seating where you can watch “traces of death.” The museum wasn’t my cup of tea but I can see how it is for many with their extensive collection of unique items. They do offer T-shirt’s, mugs, sweatshirts, pins, and more for sale.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carolinelomeli
40,Interesting!,A very unique look at the obscure. Customer support was informative and polite. Only downside was the narrow hallways and narrow spaces that made viewing hard especially went there was so much to see and read in each space.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jpyyc
20,A Graphic Serial Killer Shrine,"I hate to rate it poor but I do not like to sensationalize murderers. I had no idea what to expect but with my medical background and after reading 'Stiff: The curious lives of human cadavers' I was expecting an interesting scientific or fun facts/info type material. There were a few interesting items that we noticed including a few things you can do with the ashes of your loved ones and an old board with holes they put cadavers on that was hung off the floor, allowing blood to drain and rats not to eat it. Who knew?! But the majority was graphic stories and pictures of murders and their crime scenes. I do not get queasy in general but my stomach turned and I was so horrified that I did not want to purchase any momento to support this cause. Anyway, if this at all interests you then it will surely be interesting. At least you were warned.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cuevas210
50,SO GOOD!,"I have always found this sort of thing so interesting and have never found a place like this! I dragged my reluctant OH along to it and I literally could have spent hours in there reading everything, so glad they set this place up and are doing well! I wouldn't advise going if you don't have an interest for this sort of thing, but if you do you cannot miss it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MollyW28
50,You will never see anything like this !,"You will never see anything like this museum! They have original items from all kinds of murders, mass killings and cult deaths.I have never seen anything like this. Documents and diaries from the suspects. Collections from all kinds of murders not just local crimes. You are NOT allowed to take photographs when inside. It would really slow down the experience. Its a bit crowded, worth it!.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/saw55
50,Unusual and Macabre,"The Museum of Death is one of those places that is not for the squeamish or the sensitive. Exhibits touch on the history of serial killers (Bundy, Ramirez, Gacy, etc), cult murders and death (Jim Jones, Heavens Gate, etc) and displays of vintage mortuary equipment and a large assortment of memorabilia regarding high profile murders and deaths (Black Dahlia, Manson Family, etc)The museum is rather small but worth your time if you are so inclined to spend an afternoon dwelling on death. They even have a cool little gift shop where you can get death themed merchandise like t-shirts and bumper stickers. Small parking lot in back with free parking while at the museum.Be warned, the museum does not sugar coat the reality of death - for example, there is an instructional video showing embalming techniques very graphically (utlizing a real corpse) that plays in a loop in the mortuary room which I don't believe was ever meant to be viewed by regular folks outside of the funeral industry that is rather explicit. I strongly recommend that you do not bring young children to this museum as I feel that it may be too overwhelming for them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S2131POstevens
50,Horrifically interesting and not for the faint hearted..... loved it !,"If you are interested in death, murder and mayhem and all that that ensues then this is the place for you. Full on, in your face and very 'enlightening'. I enjoyed ( probably not the correct word ??) my few hours spent there. Glad I went....... thanks guys !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoannaS284
40,"Good museum, interesting content","Visited this museum in the evening, thinking it would be less busy, which it was, but there were still some areas that were cramped. Visit was based on a lifelong fascination with serial killer and true crime, and the content did not disappoint. Lots of details regarding various serial killers, some of which I was unaware of, so that was great. Informative section on Charles Manson, Black Dahlia, etc, fascinating. My only issues were that there we a lot of pictures around, with very little context - sure, they fit the bill of ""death"" but even a simple caption would have been really helpful. Cramped spaces in a couple rooms, but that was okay, because you can circle around the interior as much as you want, and we waiting until the particular room we liked was no longer that busy. For posterity's sake, I'd like to comment that GG Allin is for fake punks and was a piece of abusive human garbage.Also, a pretty great shop to buy materials related to museum!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/224darreng
50,Quirky and interesting,"I'd heard about this place before visiting Los Angeles and had to go and visit. Located just off Hollywood Boulevard, this place has ample parking behind the premises.The member of staff on reception that day was friendly and welcoming and asked us about our time in L.A etc and where we were from which was nice. It was reasonably priced to get in (I think it was somewhere around $15). The museum was insightful and eye opening - if you are squeamish then this definitely isn't the place for you. It contains lots of pictures/videos/news articles of real life crime scenes and dead bodies, and also a section dedicated to funeral preparation and the killing of death row inmates.As you exit the museum you end up in the gift shop which has a wide array of badges/postcards/fridge magnets as well as hoodies/posters/mugs etc.If you are into this sort of thing then definitely swing by and check it out - it's one of a kind!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ParmaViolet26
50,Very interesting but absolutely not for kids (just in case you were thinking of it),"Probably a 20 minute walk from the Hollywood Boulevard. We went at opening time and it was just my friend and i for the whole duration. Disgustingly strange, interesting, disturbing and intriguing all at the same time. The rooms are small so bear that in mind (it's more like someone's converted house) but there is a lot of information contained in here regarding serial killers, cults etc. $15 entry fee. The gift shop was quite interesting as was the siamese turtle (had to feel sorry for them though in that tiny enclosure). I would recommend the Museum as it is something a bit off the beaten track.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lisawV160OG
50,Beautifuly gore,"I really wanted to visit the museum, knew what to expect and was not disappointed. I have had a special fascination with serial killers, and I learned so much stuff that I didn't know.I read the reviews before and saw the place was a bit cramped so I went there at opening time. It was a great experience, the staff was extremely nice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ColineJrd
50,Death well documented,"My daughter, who is currently studying Forensic, wanted to visit the Museum of Death and I was a little worried about what it was really all about. I spoke with an employee there who was very open and honest about what to expect. Being a Police Officer, I knew that I could handle it but was concerned about the delivery of such topic. I was blown away by the lay out, presentation and the vast amount of information on display there. All exhibits and stories were presented in a respectful manner. I thoroughly enjoyed my experience there and I know my daughter loved it. If your interested in the history of burials, serial killers, world events that deal with murder or just plain curious about death, this is a must see. Go see it with an opened mind and be respectful to the victims of these horrendous crimes and events.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/6422016
40,True crime fans will love it,"I have always been a major true crime fan, so when I went to California for the first time I knew I had to go visit this. I took my boyfriend who has a weak stomach for this, but even he found it interesting. There are some great things to look at inside, only downer is there is a no phone rule (so no pictures) Probably do not take your children along, but that is without saying. Just down the street is Hollywood Blvd so easy to go do something once you are done.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hollybA6250FX
40,Museum of Murder,"Not at all what we expected. Hoping for a museum of skulls, education on the process of death and the science that comes with it, strange ways people have died, things like that. That's on us though, not the museum itself. The sets included very morbid and disgusting pictures (which is fine of course but we weren't prepared, lmao) including kids which is what bothered me most. The Black Dhalia area was the most interesting to me, but we definitely rushed through, I'm clearly not as tough of a person as I thought! Four stars because of the size and how cramped it was. If you're into these kinds of things I think it'd be worth the price!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OrlandoNia
50,Everything I Hoped It Would Be!,"I heard about this museum online, and when I was planning a trip to San Diego in July, I just had to go. The museum is located right on Hollywood Blvd, so you're close to the walk of fame. If the parking lot is full, there is a parking lot on the corner, only $20, worth it if you visit the attractions nearby. $15 admission, but you have to check your bags, but hey, their rules. The museum is super small, so I lingered around in one room for a period of time until the next room cleared up, but there are so many artifacts and such, you'll want to spend time reading and looking. Now, I'm a mortuary science major, I worked in a funeral home, I'm very comfortable around anything related to death, but goddamn, some of the artifacts and photos even freaked me out. So this is definitely not for children(unless they understand some of these things) or anyone who easily faints! I also learned a lot about some suicide cults, musicians, and rituals. If you're going, I suggest you bring something to write so you can take down names and whatnot. No photos allowed, so you can't use your phone at all. I like learning about deathly things, so I would write some stuff down.Lastly, before you leave, definitely buy a shirt, the merch is so cool! Someday I hope I can visit the New Orleans location",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/d0ublevee
50,"Must see for horror, true crime buffs","I doubt you've ever been to a place like this! Awe at an autopsy video, gander at Gacy's art and grimace at GG Allin's life work. It's all right here. Oh, and don't forget one of LA's favorite serial killers Charlie Manson. I'm a somewhat-new Angeleno, so I bring my out-of-town friends here every chance I get. I've been multiple times, and I'll go back a couple more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/720alyssad
50,What Would G.G. Do? Probably Buy A Hoodie.,"It occurred to me only after that I should've bought a hoodie. I have so many, hoodies are better than tshirts as souvenirs. It has to be a good fitter though. I'm tall, around 6'3"", so the hood is the tough part. It's got a lot of neck and head area to cover. This place is a hoodie goldmine, I met a roadie for James Taylor a week later who had one, I was immediately full of regret. Anyway, enter through the gift shop, you're greeted by the cheerful staff. NO PICTURES! So just don't, it'd be lame to get kicked out for that. The serial killer letter portion is worth the money alone. They all have pretty good handwriting, and some crazy illustrations. There's a lot more macabre as you make your way through. It gets tough, but hey so is life. Especially if your hood is too small.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnnK3982JZ
30,It's ok,To be honest it's really tiny in there and it's not the best. I truly thought it was going to be better. The images in there are gruesome for sure but it could be better. This is a one time visit place and that's it. Location is great though. Parking next door is 10 bucks and walk of fame is a 5 min walk away. Had to make a trip out of Hollywood since the museum of death was so small.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/theyayaborjon
40,Museum of Death - NOT FOR SMALL KIDS!,"So.... what can I say. I took my family which consisted of 16 year old twins, 10 year old girl, and a 5 year old boy. The youngest didn't really have an opinion but it was quite disturbing for my 10 year old. The staff did very good at warning us prior to going in and they stressed it several times that some things were graphic, and they were! I'm just going to say that we weren't expecting to see certain things protruding from someone's oral cavity. (I cant really say it without being graphic and I want the post to be posted.) After we went I had to do a lot of explaining and although it is good for adults I really wouldn't take children. The 16 year olds were ok but my 10 year old was definitely traumatized by 1 photo in particular. For me, it was interesting. I am intrigued by the ""dark side"" and thought it was very interesting. Once again, not a place for kids in my opinion! Also, its a lot of reading which can be very time consuming. Its a lot of articles and different things to read as well as videos playing. I would have spent more time there if I didn't take the kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FeliciaW540
40,Very Intense!,"Well, my friend to us here and well, I gotta say I got a bit queasy while walking through room to room. Not sure what got me, but it is an interesting place for sure. The place is very tight, and there was quite a lot of people there. Not sure I'd recommend for everyone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gol1ca
20,"Should be called ""Closet of Death""","Think of it as a haunted house from a travelling carnival, but instead of trying to scare you they try to make you throw up. I'm not squeamish and I have read book on most of the featured serial killers, not much new here if you were ever into the macabre.Oh yeah and they have this guy who looks like he's trying to be an emo Vincent Price. He's scary! lulzI guess they have to pay the rent, but $15 is a bit steep for what is offered.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AskYosef
30,Wow Intense,"It not my thing. My niece picked the place and it was more then what I expected. We were warned before we even walked into the museum of what to expect. The girls wanted to go, so I couldn't chicken out. I was very graphic, the picture are intense and disturbing. If your into serial killers, death, gross body part picture then this is the place for you. Not my thing but it was an experience I will never forget and some of the pics are imbedded in my memories. Very friendly staff though",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Noodles_travel
30,It all depends on what you are into...,"As soon as we entered the museum it was seriously cramped and there is a curtain over the entrance...This place is small and not laid out well. If you are the smallest bit claustrophobic this isn't the place for you..It's mostly reading and graphic photos..There are letters, some artwork, descriptions,etc...We are into the history part but some of the pictures were just too much and the embalming/prep of a body for a funeral was just yuck. Lets say those images will never leave your mind..Alot of people squishing around cases to read what was inside. You can not take any pictures which was kind of a bummer since you pay $15.00 per person to get in and parking is not included in that. We had to park pretty far away and it cost another $10.00.A little bit on the high side for a ticket considering what they have. If you are not REALLY into serial killers don't waste your time otherwise it's a cool spot to stop at for hour or 2 if you are.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dazzlingdiamond
40,Interesting,"Not for the prudish or squeamish. Included a room on serial killers including their art. Another room was about capital punishment and burial procedures and customs. The film on embalming was very interesting if somewhat difficult for some to watch. I have not seen the process shown elsewhere. Manson and the Black Dalia murders are covered in great detail. Mass suicides and wars are also featured. The staff was kind, helpful and attentive. Public restrooms available. Only one place to sit at the end of the exhibit. Lots of pictures of dead nude people so be aware.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/175MarieB
50,Super Fascinating.,If you have any sort of fascination with death or serial killers this is a must see place. With memorabilia and art work by some of the most notorious killers it's an interesting sight to see. Reasonably priced at $15 per person. But no pictures inside the actually museum since there are pretty graphic crime scene photos (such as the Tate murders by the Manson family).,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tiffanya976
50,Deathly intriguing!!,"I was unsure of this place but my daughter really wanted to go. I'm glad we did. Although some of the stuff was very disturbing, it was very interesting. Learned some things that I didn't know and confirmed that there are some seriously ill people in this world.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IMAIslandLover
50,If death is your thing this is a must see!,"All about death! For sure not for the faint of heart or kiddos! Only thing I wish was the spacing to be a bit bigger, it was really hard to look at things with other people in the room. Also they might want to lower the a/c in there it got kinda stuff in the rooms were there was a lot of people. Air flow would be great!!Its a self guided tour so take your time looking at all the artifacts. Drawings from John Wayne Gacy, crime scene photos of the black daliah. Skeletal remains of animals, Heavens gate replica. Everything your sick little mind could love. So educational too.No phones are allowed out, no pics inside. Each room is themed, I believe there was 10 or so rooms. From celebrity deaths, to amazingly detailed information on funerals. From the embalmer to the customs of a funeral. I would love to come back one day!MFM sent my sister and I to come see this amazing place and we were not disapointed!!! Fellow murderinos SSDGM, BYEEEEE!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carmended85
50,CREEPY!!,"OMG, I wasn't quite sure what to expect, but this was definitely an experience I will never forget.If you're into death then this is the spot for you, with sections on serial killers, cults, and even morticians reports it is not your average museum.I loved it but one visit was more than enough!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ultravioletmoon
50,World's Scariest Field Trip!!! Kids in Therapy!!!,"You can certainly imagine the nightmares and bed-wetting produced by this gala tribute to the ""willies""... and not just for Little Geraldine. Well, do not listen to Aunt Jan on where to take the children or you end up with 5 kids all under 15, an aggravated Sally, and her aunt in a wheel chair. The staff was professional, kind, merciful, and not overly macabre themselves. The skullery was magnificent, and Thom & Jody were unnervingly fascinated by the accoutrements. Colleen and Lisa treated to fish tacos afterward, but before that, I thought, ""I'll never eat again."" LIKE THAT LASTED!!! lol. Pricey but priceless. Thank God for the great counselors in our district because that was fun!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DenCoak138
50,A must see in Hollywood,"If you're into gore and serial killers then this is a must see. It's definitely not for the faint of heart, as they have posted all over the place. If you not good with blood and guts, I'd skip it all together. Some of the photos were quite gruesome. Otherwise, awesome experience! I'd love to see what New Orleans has to offer!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kozzzzz
40,SPECIALTY MUSEUM FOR A SPECIAL AUDIENCE,"No doubt I have passed this museum many times and never knew it was here. I saw a blurb about it in a magazine and had to pay a visit. Without a doubt, this is a specialty museum that many offend and upset many people, but if the name catches your interest, you might have an interesting visit.This is a small museum squeezed into several rooms and hallways. It can be a tight squeeze and claustrophobic on busy days. The displays are somewhat haphazard but none the less interesting if serial killers and mass murderers catch your interest. It can be hard to read the info signs especially when things are below waist level. Graphics and info signs are old style and probably could be updated but it's still interesting.Probably the ""prize"" exhibit is the head of the French serial killer guillotined in 1922. Yes, it gets bizarre and includes a pair of John Wayne Gacey's clown shows. One small room is dedicated to Charles Manson ""family"" and the Tate/LaBianca murders. Pictures of dead people adorn the walls throughout. Again, this museum is not for the faint of heart or the easily upset.I did find the video of Hollywood Celebrity deaths to be interesting though the TV is in a hallway and there is no place to stand without blocking an exhibit. The final room has seats and has a video playing of autopsies, murder and accident victims. It can be a very seriously upsetting experience for some.It was interesting but try to go when it's not busy. The first room can be packed and it is hard to look at any display. I was surprised to see people arrived with babies in strollers and toddlers. I would NOT recommend this museum for kids.Entry is $15 plus a $1 fee if you use a credit card",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jackbear
50,I would stay all day if I could.,"As someone who is fascinated by why people do the things they do in regards to true crime, this museum is an absolute must see.From the get go the staff are so friendly and welcoming, you're told the rules, which while few are easy to follow.You then go through the different exhibits showing you various things from various different criminals/killers etc.If you plan on visiting I would free up a lot of time as there is a lot of writing to read and it can take a while if you really want to read every little bit.While this place is fantastic it's not for the easily squeamish and faint of heart, however they do allow you to leave and enter as many times as you want with your ticket if you need to fresh air.They also have a small gift shop with some amazing prices. As a bigger girl it is really hard for me to buy clothes from places such as this, however I found that I was more than able to fit into the clothes they sold. Maybe it wasn't such a good idea after I almost bought the whole place!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/593christyp
50,Fun that Feeds your Morbid Side,"This place was amazing. I loved the tour, but then again I'm a huge horror film buff, serial killer enthusiast and a fan of the macabre. This place is definitely dark and not for the faint of heart. It covers death and mostly in the brutal way. Taking a look at many serial killers, execution styles and mass suicides. There's even a roomDedicated to the process of a autopsy complete with a video on how to get a dead body ready for burial. There are picture of real life murders and accidents so if your squeamish, close yours eyes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/InASenseLost0909
40,Interesting if you're morbidly curious,"This museum has a lot to see, I spent a long time in here trying to read as much as I could. The first room is mainly about big name serial killers, the next room had a section about death penalty in the USA. There was a room about funerals and the different death procedures. There's videos, photos, documents and displays along the way. My favourite was probably the parts about famous people dying. This definitely leans more on the gruesome/shock side of things. I really didn't like the inclusion of certain photographs such as the mocking full frontal nudes of an ex partner that couple took after killing the person and who were ultimately caught because they developed the pictures. I just felt like they didn't need to have those on display. The museum was a bit pricey too and no photographs are allowed in the main museum. You can take pictures in the gift shop",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bmflynn
30,Fun way to pass some time - staff were rude though,"Went here after it was recommended by friends, and had a pretty good time.The staff annoyed me on the way in, because they made me put my small backpack behind the counter, then I walked straight in and saw two girls with massive hand bags, bigger than my backpack. I went back to argue it and they got pretty rude about it and made out like I was making a fuss over nothing, and said it was the rule that backpacks have to be handed in because people can knock things over with them. Why should i hand my small backpack in (which had all my travel cash and passport in) when there are girls walking round with massive handbags knocking into people? Meh!Anyway... the museum itself is very small and cramped, and was very busy when we went. I would have enjoyed it more if there were more space to take everything in and actually read all the information on the walls (there is a LOT). But I kept feeling like we were being forced along from room to room due to the volume of people.There are some really interesting bits in there, just try and go when it's not busy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jennyferjay
50,Bucket list !,Ever since I heard of this place it's been on my bucket list and finally 4 years later I get my chance and was not disappointed. Wish I could have taken pictures but it wasn't allowed. Very eye opening cool museum! Can't wait to go back and to get to New Orleans one to check it out !,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brandiswest
50,A great find,"I'd heard about this museum and really wanted to go but kept missing out on it. But on our last day we were down the end of Hollywood Blvd and on the walk back had to do it. It's full of interesting things, from letters to toys, coffins to cult and serial killer info. An interesting trip out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sianarealla
40,Something different to do in LA,"If you want something different in Hollywood, this is definitely the place to visit. Some historical artefacts, but mainly photos and stories. So many things to look at and read, you could spend hours here if you went through it all. Some rooms are overwhelming with the amount of information there is, and not for the squeamish. If you like a bit of gore, it should be on your list",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/briony_beckett
50,Gorephile paradise,"If you're fascinated with serial killers, cults, original murder scene photography, taxidermy pets (some famous even) and all things death related- look no further! This place has some pretty amazing artifacts from the Manson Family, Black Dahlia, and heavens gate cult. It's not for the faint hearted, there's some disturbing stuff in there so be ready to be unsettled if this subject matter makes you uncomfortable. Free parking, and a helpful and knowledgeable staff makes this place a no miss in my opinion!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danicomeplaywithus
50,Awesomely morbid!,"This was the highlight of a short trip to LA! I'm so glad we saw it on the bus ride to our hotel! If you are queasy at all, I wouldn't recommend it. Great memorabilia and very nice, knowledgeable staff. If I'm ever in LA again, I'll be coming for another visit. Don't miss the Siamese turtle when you first walk in!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jnjdewey
50,Unique experience,"I have always had a fascination with true crime and was beyond excited to visit the museum on my latest trip to LA.We went on a Friday afternoon and there were a decent amount of people in there. The rooms are small and can feel pretty crowded with more than about five people in them.The museum is not for the faint of heart. They have real crime scene photos from some of the most gruesome crimes in LA, mortician tools, etc.The serial killer archives room was my favorite. Getting to see letters written from famous serial killers from prison was fascinating.I was pretty bummed out over not being able to take pictures inside, but that was the only negative of the entire time we were there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/storyk1203
30,"Small and pricey, but still interesting","The mere fact that this is the 'Museum of Death', you can expect to see an interesting array of visitors all out to satisfy their morbid curiosity. It's also not a very large place, so you may want to plan your visit on a weekday when you're less likely to be shoulder-to-shoulder with the masses. I was there on a Saturday, which made for a rather congested visit. The addition of the pod of frat boys whispering ""keep it tight...keep it tight"" throughout, was less than welcome.Tickets are $15 for adults, which I feel is a bit pricey for what they offer. Considering I had just come from the world-class Petersen Automotive Museum and paid the same admission, I think an $8-$10 entry would be more appropriate for this place. I think they rely on the uniqueness of the subject matter to command the higher price, but it could be a better value. On the plus side, they do have a private lot in back with free parking, but you may have to look elsewhere if you go on one of the busier days. They also have a 'no photos or videos' policy, which I respected, hence the lack of photos with this review.As most reviewers have said, this place is not for the faint-of-heart. Given the very graphic nature of some of the photos with gruesome death scenes, and even full nudity (which is usually in conjunction with the gruesome death scenes), I don't think they should allow children in there at all, but they do. I don't even think this should be a parent's decision. It's just not appropriate. I saw a woman with her 5 or 6 year-old daughter in there who was covering her face the whole time and almost in tears. Nice parenting.As I said, it's a pretty small space, and was busy/crowded on the day I went. I would suggest they do timed-entry (maybe every 10-15 minutes) to eliminate some of the backlog. It wasn't a comfortable experience. The museum is partitioned into several rooms, each with different themes, but that essentially makes for somewhat of a restricted walkway and practically forces everyone into a single-file line. Perhaps the best analogy I can make is that it feels like you're walking through a small haunted house at Halloween with circus side show memorabilia on display. You half expect someone to jump out and scare the hell out of you and, when I forgot that there was a life-sized Charles Manson cardboard cut-out behind me, that's pretty much what happened.I was impressed at some of the items the museum managed to procure: clothing worn during an electric chair execution, original artwork and correspondence from convicted serial killers, and the severed head (by guillotine) of French serial killer Henri Désiré Landru (The Bluebeard of Gambais), to name a few. I mean...you don't just find this stuff on ebay. You'll also see vintage caskets and mortician's tools, autopsy photos, stories and photos of some of the more famous crime scenes (Charles Manson and Tate/LaBianca murders, Nicole Brown Simpson/Ron Goldman, The Black Dahlia, etc) and a plethora of other death-related paraphernalia. I do think that some displays could use a little more attention in making them more professional (i.e.: letters and drawings slipped into sheet protectors and placed in binders, cheesy mannequins in coffins, etc), but most are presented as expected.The museum even has a gift shop with shirts, videos, postcards and the like, although I'm not sure I want to meet the person who buys the Museum of Death onesie for their newborn baby.All-in-all, I think the museum delivers what most visitors expect. The biggest negatives are the price/value and being there when it's busy, so plan accordingly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M2452NFcraigc
50,Expect the unexpected,I wasn't sure what to expect and was pleasantly surprise just how tasteful and educational the displays were. It's well worth a visit and the $15 charge. Staff are friendly and know a lot on the subject. Facing the taboo subject of death in this manner is highly recommended but truly not for the faint hearted.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VampyreNance
20,Interesting,"I really thought there would be more displaysIf you like reading this is a place for youif you google ""death museum"" you find they have ""bodies"" in display like in the science museum.Don't expect to see any of that",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/veronicav261
40,Unique and morbid. Very interesting.,"If you are like me, and have an interest in documentaries and books about this sort of thing, then this museum will be right up your street.It's unique in that you don't see many museums anywhere in the world that focuses on this subject matter so that alone makes the $15 entrance fee worthwhile.BEWARE though. This museum does not sugar-coat anything. The exhibits here are disturbing, gory, gruesome. chilling and hold nothing back . Perfect for some, a thing of nightmares for others (a few had to leave when I was in there).The place is small with about 7 or 8 themed rooms, but they pack a lot in. Go when it's quieter though (a weekday, early afternoon) as it can get crammed and very hot.I won't list the exhibits (The website does that), but think serial killers, suicides, death row, celebrity deaths, cannibals and death death death.Everything inside is available on the internet if you know what you are looking for, but that said it's presented in a very macabre and unique way, which a lot of people will get a kick out of.I agree with some people's comments here when they say that some exhibits within this museum are disrespectful and glorify some of the events described.... especially the theatre at the end showing the ""faces of death"" movie. If that sort of thing is too much for you I would avoid this museum, as this place can easily upset and disgust.Not for the faint of heart, so think hard before you go.Me personally, I thought this place was very well done and put together. Great and friendly staff too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeadSoulsSocialClub
40,It is harsh...be prepared.,"I get what the previous reviewer is saying.....you can sensationalize the subject of death, or be more respectful. I agree that the ongoing video at the end was a bit disrespectful, playing heavy metal music while an obnoxious voice-over glorifies the death scene your viewing.At the same time, death is a fascinating subject, and this museum offers a window into something that is inevitable (death), and a window into the dark side of human nature.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/product-of-canada
40,Unique but maybe a little distasteful?,"It's not like there are Museums of Death on every corner so this is definitely a unique attraction. I'm not a faint-hearted person and I have worked in the forensic profession. But in that profession, they teach you to have respect for the dead, and there were sometimes when the whole thing seemed distasteful. I know that seems ridiculous as its called the Museum of Death, but there are ways to talk about serial killers and show death photos without almost glorifying it. I mean they have a video of car crash deaths as they blast heavy metal music and someone talks over it like a 14-yr-old boy talks about a horror film. That's just my opinion, but I may be alone in that. I still think the whole museum has gathered some interesting artifacts. You could spend forever in the place, but it was so packed when I was in there, you kind of want to move it along. And it will get and stick with you if it's not something you usually see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brittanyzz
20,Freaky,Small felt very claustrophobic.. lots of letters and art work from mass murders lots of artifacts. To crowded when we went didn't get a chance to read the stuff on the wall some of the films were pretty disturbing... no pictures allowed,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vlad178tx
40,"Not for the faint of heart, but damn, it was fun!","Ok, I used to teach mortuary science students, so death and gory stuff doesn't bother me, but if you don't know what you're walking into, be advised. There is some very graphic photography here, and it could make some folks very uneasy. I've always had a fascination with the Tate/LaBianca murders and the Manson family, so it was interesting to see an entire section devoted to that crime. All the usual suspects are here: Dahmer, Gacy, Manson, Jim Jones, OJ, Heavens Gate, and even that creepy punk rocker GG Allin. You'll see taxidermy, shrunken heads, body parts for sale, and all kinds of weird stuff. But good weird. Friendly staff, too. Not suitable for kids or folks who have issues with gruesome visuals.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mercurysqueen
40,Excellent museum for what it is,"This is kind of an odd museum and morbid to say the least but you kind of know that before you go. They actually have done a good job with the museum itself though. Warning though, I literally had a dream about someone trying to hang me the next night.. It's not for kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jimmyr460
50,Not for the weak hearted,"Didn't know what to expect and boy did we get a fill. Museum is well put together with different room about serial killers and car wrecks and anything else involved with death. Some of the videos maybe tuff for the weak hearted but just look away you'll ""LIVE""😀",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/coopervanning
40,Pretty Decent Way to Spend an Hour,"If you have $15 and a hour to spare, this is worth attending. Not every exhibit is fascinating but a majority will certainly capture your attention, shock you or teach you something. It's not for everyone, I'd keep young children away, some gruesome imagery and details. Simple lay-out, well put together.It's a fairly small museum and isn't the most interesting in the world so I wouldn't go out of my way in LA to visit this but if you have the time then you could spend it in worse ways.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yewha
30,Not for everyone,"This is definitely not for everyone, if you are easily offended or squeamish you should not go. If you are fascinated by the weird and unusual this a perfect stop. It is packed with all manner of things related to death. There is serial killer art, autopsy equipment, a film on embalming, and much, much more. Just the Charles Manson film is enough to creep you out. Be sure and pay attention to the other patrons, as some of them were just as interesting as the exhibits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MitchDFW
30,Bizarre,"When you read books or watch TV on serial killers, you get fascinated. Well, I do. But, to actually see photos or videos of death, it is unnerving. The museum was a collection of photos and videos with skulls and props. I think I'll stick to my books. For some reason, I really got uncomfortable and I thought I could handle a lot of things.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nozzydiva
50,Four Words.,"This place is awesome.So so so awesome, it's very confronting in some instances but I thoroughly enjoyed it. Great for history buffs like myself. The staff were awesome as well, super friendly & welcoming! A must see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kellilucas
40,"Very honest and educational, though not for those with a weak stomach","We spent about 2 hours here reading through only a tiny portion of the thousands of documents they have here. They have put together the displays really well and if you do have an interest in forensic pathology, they have a great archive of cases.I would give 5 stars if not for the movie they show at the end which is just death after death caught on film with no explanation as to why. It seemed to be showing death for the sake of showing death and I found it to be a bit disrespectful to the deceased.But if we skipped that room the rest was 5 stars",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/611hayleyj
10,MUSEUM OF DEATH,"came here last year, but found it dead boring, I wouldn't do it again. wouldn't recommend it unless your into that sort of thing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lindsey150765
50,A Macabre Delight,"Being the macabre and dark person I am I had been wanting to visit for a long while. I was very excited for this part of the trip and I was not left disappointed. I should say you really have to like to look at things and enjoy learning. You should not go if you are easily offended or grossed out, seriously. The front lobby has a nice display of wet specimens you can purchase. They also have a live two-headed turtle as well and some MoD merchandise. The whole place is divided into themed rooms you walk through at your own pace. There is quite a bit of collected material. I believe the first room is a serial killer room. It goes on and on through different themes relating to death in different manners and stages and time periods. I personally loved it and would love to go back. This is not for children, this is not for people who just like horror and think it will be cool, there are a LOT of very very graphic pictures and subject matter there. Not for the faint of heart.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BoobaFatt
30,Extremely Interesting place...maybe not worth the entrance fee though,"Full of pictures that you thought weren't available to anyone. 10 out of 10 for shock value if you're into that. We enjoyed reading the various documents that were on display. No photos allowed or food & drink, so drink up before you enter or leave them under reception desk like we did.Well worth a visit but take it all in as it's not cheap to see stuff.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HappyCouple2014
10,Waste of time,"The museum is quite small with about 7 or 8 rooms. Most of it is very cluttered, it contains details of a few serial killers, newspaper cuttings black and white pictures of beheadings from 19th century china, as well as a film of a person being gored by a bull. There's pictures and details of an autopsy as well as pictures of a nude girl next to a mutilated corpse. Overall not my sort of thing at all and definitely not for children. It is also pretty expensive at $15 each person, was packed with people and hot when we went and we stayed less than 10 minutes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zeezeezee1
40,Interesting,"I can't add much to the other reviews. It isn't for the squeamish and maybe there should be an age guide, even allowing for the strap line that everyone dies. I enjoyed it and found it fascinating however, I did feel that the focus was on sensationalism and I would have preferred some more information and context, e.g. why is there a recreation of JFK's head after shooting. We know he died but what was the purpose of the model? It was just there without any obvious comment. And maybe there could have been a little more sensitivity in presenting the photos and footage. Overall, it was good value for money and fascinating.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fabmum66
30,Not my cup of tea.,Sorry but this just isn't for everyone. I don't enjoy autopsy photos or other grisly crime scene pics. If you're into that then maybe you might enjoy it. The staff were friendly though. One of my sons thought it was fun but the other bee-lined for the door as soon as he realized what kind of museum it was.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leep6802
50,Awesome!!,"Awesome museum, really big collection of serial murderer artwork, photos and videos. Amazing place!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dede-peanuts

50,Unusual Museum,"Admittedly an unusual topic for a museum. However, this museum is fascinating and has so many exhibits and artifacts that it is certainly worth the 15 dollar admission fee. No photograph policy is disappointing. This museum has several rooms dedicated to serial killers and a fascinating room about autopsies and various cultural burying rituals. Well worth the hour and a half self guided tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/harveyj656
20,"""smothered to death""",Too much stuff cramped into a few small rooms.Too many people cramped into these same small room trying to take in all the items/info combined with a non- existing/working cooling system and you end up with a very unpleasant experience!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jbmvan
30,Loads of information,I was expecting this place to have even more shock factor but it wasn't as grimm as I was thinking it would be. Don't get me wrong it's not place for faint hearted. They have tons of information and you can easily spend an hour just reading all to documents. The exhibition is mainly focused on the american serial killers. Didn't regret visiting!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HenriSuopanki
40,Very interesting,"I was interested to see what was in this museum and had a great time. The information is from serial killers, autopsies, suicides, mass murders and assorted other ways you can die. Some was graphic in an interesting way and other was educational. Really neat place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/erawson77
40,interesting place,"My son wanted to visit this place while we were in town for a festival. location was easy to find, and they have free parking in the back, which is a huge plus, though its a small lot and you may not find any on a busy day. Admission was $15 per person, which is fair. We spent about a half hour in there, the rooms are small and can get crowded quickly. its mostly articles and interviews around serial killers etc. some interesting history on the electric chair as well, and an interesting section on what happens after death. The staff is very friendly and welcoming, and there is a small gift shop as well on site. They warn on their website that its very graphic, but i did not find it an issue. They have a room dedicated to Charles Manson which was extremely interesting.. Overall we enjoyed our visit",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KaraleeP2
40,Morbid curiosity?,"Where do I begin to describe this eerie place? It was a very random impromptu stop while my friend and I were searching for a place to grab lunch. We happened to see it on the map and thought it would be a funny spontaneous stop to add to our day.This place is extremely morbid and very gruesome. The first thing you see when you enter are the CLOWN paintings by John Wayne Gacy and you end with the ability to view some sort of autopsy video.You have little themed rooms that you wander in and out of that have (graphic) photos of auto accidents to cereal killer headshots and news clippings. Some of the displays seem almost shrine-like with how they are set up.I honestly glanced over many of the photos are they were too much as well as some of the detailed descriptions. One additional and unsettling observation was how many people were there on a random afternoon. Since the museum is located on Hollywood Boulevard, it does have a high chance of tourists coming by to to visit the California killers room to their Black Dahlia related Charles Manson tours complete, but many wandering about seemed very intrigued in the gory details which I found as off-putting as some of the things I saw and read.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MadamVeuve
30,Not As Bad As I Thought It Would Be,There is some gore and other gruesome items on display but most of it is in photos. Pictures of crime scenes and executions. Went on a Saturday afternoon and the place was very busy. Very hard to see the exhibits and maneuver as it was very crowded and there isn't much room to move around. Very limited parking in the back. Had to park on the street.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OnTheRoadAgain1056
50,FACT BASED !,"Nothing is made up here or sugar coated. If you are squeamish or sensitive you are warned many many times over this is not for you.This is detective based physicality of crime scenes. If you think you know a particular case you will see previously unseen articles or photos.Strange but true on all our tours Museum of Death has the most helpful, knowledgeable and just plain courteous staff. In their advertising, it states stay as long as you care to and take as many photos as you would like.When you walk in it clearly states no photos, this maybe new policy.There are plenty of good photo ops outside.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/madisons709
20,Some interesting stuff but mainly sensationalist gore,"Some interesting stuff but mainly collections of gory photos that were quite disturbing, little or no explanation, seemed just for shock value. Would be better with more explanation and point to it all. Ie. not just graphic photos of traffic accident victims, murder victims, rotting corpses, etc. Some of it was really tragic and could have been dealt with a bit more sensitively. We weren't expecting rainbows and unicorns (it is the museum of death!) but there seemed to be a lot of gore just for the heck of it. Don't recommend unless you want to spend $15 to look at some horrific photos and not much else.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JuliaA907
50,Not for the faint of heart,"As soon as we walked into the Museum we were greeted by a very friendly staff, We were told to take as much time as we wanted looking at all the displays.I was totally taken back by how sick and cruel our world really is and all of that was on display right in front of us, Be warned this is not an attraction for people with a weak stomach. From serial killers and the art they did to an assortment of other crazy and disturbing artifacts.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jayr30
30,Both Fascinating and disturbing,"If you don't like blood and guts and gore and other such morbid things, especially as its all pretty much real life, then avoid this.I was OK but other half was struggling to keep his lunch down.Absolutely fascinating, especially the drink driving autopsy photos and i think everyone will remember the photoshoot the couple did with an ex ex partner, incredible and disturbing on every level.One negative apart from the gore is id say only 30% was labeled, a lot of the time i didn't know what i was looking at and i wanted to.Good as a bit of a novelty while in LA :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/helenbW5071HB
50,Wow! Very Interesting...,"This place is AWESOME! It's located at the end of the Walk of Fame, so it might be a bit out of the way for some people, and there is an admission fee. Staff is very friendly and will tell you before paying that most of the content is pretty graphic - and they are certainly not lying. Although our family (with adult/teenage kids) was fine, we saw a younger family send only half their group in once they had arrived. I do NOT recommend bringing children here. The museum contains about 12-13 rooms filled with a wide variety of letters, images, videos, and random interesting items pertaining to the subject of death. There's a good deal of information/items/pictures concerning murder, but not just the popular serial killers you hear about often. I found the final room to be the most jarring - there is a TV set up that plays various clips of people being executed/killed, and they do not censor anything. You really do walk away appreciating life just a little bit more! This is a great, unique LA spot unlike any museum I have seen before (and I've seen my fair share)!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SnappleSpice
30,For a Certain Type of Person,"If you're the type of person that likes to google photos of crime scenes, this museum is for you. If you're the type of person who likes well thought out, organized exhibits this place isn't for you. Didn't tie death or murder into any larger picture of society or try to give it any meaning or context, just lots of pics and gore everywhere. History of the electric chair was interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Magellan1492
50,Gore!,"Parked at Hollywood & Highland so we had to walk quite a distance to get here, but it was all worth it!The museum was great and had lots of grusome videos and pictures and a lot of interesting facts and history about all the notorious serial killers. We spent a good hour here. The price was $15 per person, but it was all worth it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sabrinaisabellab
50,Great place,Really interesting and well worth a visit but not for the faint of heart! Looks of cool photos and things to look at,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sallym458
40,Not for the Faint of Heart,This is a collection of 30 years of death. Many are crime scene and autopsy photos donated to the owner. Some of the exhibit is cheesy. Much is very interesting such as the memos that were circulated about Jeffrey Dahlmer. There is a very large area on Charles Manson and The Black Dahlia. Get there when they first open. The rooms are small and become crowded.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TrippyLawyer
40,Death in all its guises,"What a place, very interesting and definitely worth a look, but allow a couple of hours to make your way through, and definitely not for the faint hearted.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jodiee517
40,Unique Must See Museum,"Definitely not your average museum for the whole family. This is more geared to adults.The staff were excellent and helpful throughout the visit and as well arranged a taxi to pick us up.Interesting to learn about all the crazy killers in North America at this unique collection of artifacts, art, letters and collectibles from murderers and mass murderers.Not for the faint of heart and a great unique thing to do for an hour in Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mwellaby

30,16 yo daughter loved it; I'd had enough halfway through,"This is a weird one. Artifacts from serial killers, mortuary photos... if you have a fascination for such stuff, you'll enjoy. I got as far as the concentration camp room before calling it a day.NOT for children. Or sensitive types . Or really ANYONE unless you have a morbid fascination for the remnants of generally sick, insane people or other unfortunates. $15 a head to get in, a series of rooms pretty well stuffed with stuff to look at. But why would you, really?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AgC2012

50,Birthday Weekend,"Took my grandkids, 13 and 16. It was awesome. I think you have to be into this type of stuff though. It's not a regular museum. They have videos of a mortician preparing a body, serial killer art, autopsy photos, a taxidermist room, celebrity deaths, etc. Anything to do with death is here. Everything is very graphic. If you are easily scared or can't stomach blood and guts this isn't for you. Probably not for most children either.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deharo70
40,"Great, but don't go before eating!","A meticulous collection of all things death related, yes a lot of this information can be found on the internet but it's not the kind of stuff I would ever look up.I especially enjoyed the cannibalism section, the photo of a tribeswoman chomping on a severed leg urghhh!Having recently lost my father, there were a couple of moments when I actually regretted going in, but I was OK once I got past the funeral section.Some of it was so gory I kept getting flashbacks of blood & guts during the rest of the day.Certainly a unique and disturbing experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jannyrocks
40,Very Strange but interesting place!,"This place is not for the faint of heart! It is an interesting walk-though which shows a huge range of objects which were owned or used by very famous serial killers! It also contains very gruesome pictures of crime scene which are not for everyone. Was very good source of information on the killers so found it interesting! Would recommend but once you have been, you don't need to go again!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/XStark1ll3rX
40,Must-see for the Morbid!,I am fascinated by serial killers and this museum was one of the most interesting exhibits I have ever seen. They feature photos of crime scenes that you cannot often find and all around intriguing information set up in a nice walking tour through a spooky building. I would definitely go again!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kmcgrew90
50,Morbidly Fascinating,"The Museum of Death was not something I had heard of before I looked up things to do in Hollywood. It is located just a block from the start of the walk of fame. The entry way starts with a gift shop. The entrance fee is $15 dollars but you can easily find a $1 off coupon at hotels and tourist centers.The museum rooms feature a morbid assortment serial killer art, electric chair, coffins, real autopsy photos, taxidermy animals, skulls, and fairly gruesome photos from murders and car accidents including famous cases such as The Black Dahlia and the Manson murders.I would not recommend this for children or people who don't like gore. If you have a weak stomach, you will be severely grossed out by the subject material, and some of the artwork and topics is NSFW.Fans of the genre, those who don't scare easily, strong stomachs and morbidly curious, you will likely very much enjoy the assortment of curiosities on display, I certainly did.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/20melanieg
40,"Jam-packed, full of interesting stuff","I'm always intrigued by these small, home-made, single-subject museums, but they are often disappointingly lame. The MOD was fascinating -- well organized, and the staff were very knowledgeable and helpful. It prompted some interesting discussions among our group of 4.O There was so much to see, I feel we only really took in a tiny fraction. The video montage at the end -- running a loop of video captures of people dying in hideous accidents -- while probably all available on the internet (people getting gored by bulls, etc.), was the only thing that felt like ""too much"". I couldn't watch. Overall, though, VERY WELL DONE! And great gift shop",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bos2nK
40,Cool museum - mature audiences only.,"This museum has a TON of things to look at. My favorites were the serial killer room, the Heaven's Gate display, and the quilt made by the Manson Family Women. Obviously don't bring your kids here, and don't push yourself or the people you are visiting the museum with to look at things you or they don't want to. Admission is $15 and it's well spent - you can easily spend 2 hours in here. Rooms and hallways are small. There is a small souvenir shop. Also - a live Siamese turtle!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/haleysicle
40,WOW,"I have no idea why I chose to go to this place but I did. It was kinda creepy but also very interesting and informative about certain things like the serial killers, mass murderers, mass suicides, crime scene photos, autopsies etc.. Even the staff seemed a lil creepy. I think the creepiest for me was the room with the life size version of GG Allin. When I came out of there I just looked up at the sky and I was happy to be alive!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SenoritaBlackBarbie
30,Wasn't quite what we thought it would be..,"First, the price is waaaay more than it should be.. $15 for what they say are 12 rooms is almost highway robbery. Secondly, as other reviews have mentioned, most if not a majority of the random pictures have little to no backstory.. You can find some pretty gruesome things online, with detailed stories. Third, some of the rooms are way to jammed with stuff that I had a hard time seeing it all, with people behind you and all around you they are moving fast some slow, it was a bit of a mess. I was pretty surprised at how it was all put together but if the other people in our group hadn't wanted to go so bad we would of most likely sat this one out..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nathan2053
30,More Museum of Serial Killers than Museum of Death,"This Museum is worth a visit; however, I think it needs a new curator or a sort out. It is more a young boys bedroom who likes to collect information about serial killers.If this is the case then I think the owner needs to focus on this. There is a lot of material of interest. Especially to a foreigner. For example the use of the Electric chair and the death penalty.The museum also flags up a number of prolific serial killers, but it all gets lost in the over filled cabinets.Lastly there is a pointer towards past death practices, however, when I asked the guy on the desk about modern death practices and if the US is heading towards more environment friendly burial, he looked at my like an Alien!I really think this good be made a lot better. They need to look at what they have. Throw out the clutter and showcase the past present and future of American death.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sooxanne

30,A little disappointing,"$15 cover charge is a big much for what it is. There's lots of gruesome pictures, but most had no explanation for what they are or the story behind them. Others did have explanations, but were easy to miss. The staff were very friendly though and asked a few times if they could answer any questions we may have. The video at the end was just a lot of footage of dead people, once again, no context or explanation as to what had happened.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Andrewjochelsea
30,Not for the feint hearted,"It's a small museum, $15 entry charge is a little steep for the size. Interesting exhibits but some very graphic photos which some people may find upsetting, but the name of the museum should be a clue, so don't go expecting not to see depictions of murder scenes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Reb1975
50,Deathly different!,"Visited this awesome little museum with mybpartner not really knowing what to expect.The memorabilia , pictures and furniture are eerily creepy and intriguing . I would highly recommend a visit to this museum.I was really interested in the art completed by the executed killers . Very interesting .....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mattyjoel
50,"Creepy as hell, but in the best way.","This museum is really interesting, and really well put together. I was amazed at everything they had inside. Whoever put it together did a really great job and is very creative in a weird (but good way haha). I was amazed, totally grossed out, and disgusted at the same time. Definitely worth visiting. I would NOT recommend bringing kids though, it would probably really freak them out. Really well done.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kayla_Chrisman
40,Good but Grizzly!!,"We walked along Hollywood Blvd from Graumans Chinese, a good walk if you want to see the stars on the sidewalk, Its a bit far, Taxi or bus is better. Is it for kids? not really very well done themed attraction but is a bit graphic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alan1961
50,Awesome museum! Not for the faint of heart.,"I've been to the Museum of Death a few times now, and it's always a fun time. I always enjoy taking a new person when I'm in town to see their reaction to the exhibits. I won't sugar coat it, it's kind of creepy. From the serial killer artwork, to the step by step process of an embalming room, to the exhibits on cults and cannibalism, this place is awesome. If you're up for an intense look at death, this place is a must!I rated this as ""Not Sure"" when it comes to children. That's up to you. If you think your child can handle an intense look at death and be able to understand what they are seeing, then by all means, take your kids and educate them, but this is not a elementary school field trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/timdrake42
50,"You have to go, but not right after lunch",This was very interesting and very grotesque. But its a must if you have and hour or so to kill and want to learn about some of america's best murderers.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Stephanny123
50,interesting museum,"it was a very interesting and kind of creepy experience but overall it was very satisfying museum, learned a lot from every section/room they had and the images were very gore. so just go with an empty stomach!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vampyro
40,Interesting,This museum on Hollywood bvld was mainly dedicated to serial killers but had some other interesting things about death it was only $15 so to me it was worth it,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Steevz
50,Museum Of Death was very cool and creepy,Last year I want to the Museum of Death with a friend and I thought it was very amazing because the museum has a lot of interesting facts about death and cool artifacts.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rachaelk924
40,Interesting but really creepy,"I was thinking about this museum for days after I went. Exhibits are really creepy,especially the serial killer artwork room, and the death photos. Also creepy are the eclectic group of visitors with you. Lots of goth enthusiasts, and people way to interested in the gory photos. All in all it is a unique experience. Had fun here",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/494williamr
30,Death becomes her..,"Out of all the museums we visited, I was really looking forward to this one. It sounded so different.First I will let you know I am not a person who advocates things about serial killers or merchants of death but we all have a strange fascination in why these people are who they are or in some cases were. We went on probably the wettest day in L.A The gentlemen who greeted us was really nice and informative about the museum and how to get around. We did love the music on entry it was loud. So it started off well. The first part of the museum is about serial killers, lots of letters, art, a doco playing but it only touched the surface. Moving on it got a little gruesome but interesting, the role of death in different cultures and burials, autopsies. Then on to the biggest I suppose murderer Manson a whole room for ol' Chuck lots of tidbits of correspondence with the ""family"" . We get a bit of the death cults next, Jonestown and stuff all very tragic really. Celebrity deaths the main one being Jayne Mansfield which I am not sure but Hollywood still seems to be infatuated with her, we encountered Jayne a few times on our travels in L.A.The room I did not expect was G.G Allin, who would of thought, this is the room I found most interesting, My partner has lots of his stuff and I will be honest I never really got it but this room added to what I didn't know.There is some ghoulish and gruesome aspects of the museum but it is easy to move on. It didn't answer my questions on serial killers or death really but maybe they are curiosities not meant to be answered. I do not recommend this if you are bit squeamish but if you do have a little interest in that stuff, it is different and well worth the visit",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarolineM852
50,Not for the Weak,"If you love talking about death, serial killers, have a strong stomach and have a dark sense of humor...this place is for you. The Museum of Death educates those who enter on what it means to die when it comes to where your spirit may or may not go and how your body is prepared for cremation or burial.The museum boasts an impressive collection of serial killer memorabilia, a small room for taxidermy, a collection of the occult, and even a small area on how cultures all over the world treat death.You walk yourself through the museum and can take all the time you like. It's really not for those who get squeamish easily, there are pictures of corpses and graphic murder scenes not for the faint of heart. I wouldn't recommend children, but this is a great place for anyone who has a dark sense of humor and or those who are fascinated by these taboo like topics.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CaledoniaH
40,"Good, but lacking something.","I have a keen interest in horror, gore and serial killers so I was so excited to visit this museum.It was full of pictures, articles, artefacts and other odd objects.I'm really good with handling disturbing images and videos, but there was one room that was very confronting as you are surrounded by images of decapitated, crushed, bloody bodies, I found that room to be overwhelming. It could have been a car accident theme room but I can't remember.It's worth a visit, but it was lacking a certain something that I can't quite put my finger on.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SSCW
40,Well....,"It lives up to its name, it's pretty gory but it was good. I learned quite a bit in regards to a combination of different things I never had even thought to inform myself over, my friend and I came in later in the evening and the guy working was so kind and stayed late for us so we could go through. Good experience in the one and only Hollywood!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/579tarak
40,Dark Obsession,"As with many small museums, this one seems to have emerged out of a personal obsession - here, focused on the dark, disorderly, and chaotic. The Museum of Death is a twisted intersection where sensationalism, the cult of celebrity and murder all meet. I loved certain exhibits (skull display, burial material, Day of the Dead, & Liberace's stuffed Persian cat) and found others distasteful (crime and accident scene photographs). You will have to pick and choose to make the experience your own. Don't be afraid to skip what you don't like; there is plenty of strangeness to go around.As previous reviewers have noted, this is a not a place for children or the faint of heart. Some visitors will be enamored by the willy-nilly displays crammed with information and graphic visuals; while others are sure to be disturbed by what could well be described as exploitative material.Surroundings are tight & hard to navigate so not really wheelchair friendly.Admission fee - $15",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pookala
40,"Great stories, gruesome images!","The name says it all.Room 1 - Stories of serial killers, copies of police reports, newspaper cuttings.Room 2 - Death row killling devices, Chinese beheading photosRoom 3 - Autopsies, videos, tools, burialsRoom 4 - Car accident photos, Mansen stories, suicide cultsRoom 5 - Cannibals, specimens, more gorey stuff.That's a quick overview, a whole lot more to see and you could literally spend hours in there. Really interesting but i did feel a bit queasy when i left!!$15 admission for self guided tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeeLad82
40,hollywierd -museum of death,"there's enough curiosity about this place, that you just have to see it to believe it. this is definitely a place that you would not take the kids. for those individuals who like the darker side of life, this would be right up your alley. i'm not a big person when it comes to things like this, but my wife talked me into going in, and then apologized. none of the exhibits made me queezy, or sick to my stomach, much less make a bee-line for the exit, but it did make me realize on just how sick, twisted, or misguided that some individuals can be.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/909SteveC
40,Gory and Graphic,"Located right in the middle of Hollywood, the Museum of Death lives up to its name. It's a small space, with a handful of rooms dedicated to serial killers, dead celebrities, and other morbid features. The news clips and photos of actual murders were a lot to handle, and I felt anxious going through each room. The only area that did not gross me out was a section highlighting how different cultures handle funerals (the examples they had on display were for Chinese, Jewish, and Mexican burials and it was interesting to learn about their processes). In the final stretch, there is an area set up to resemble a funeral home that also serves as a tribute to GG Allin (whom the owner is a very big fan of). I don't understand the appeal of it, but everyone has their interests. If you're in Hollywood and want a place to escape the heat/rain, or want to check out something a little out of the ordinary, then this is for you. Eating beforehand, however, is not recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/phanteana
40,Very interesting,If you have a weak stomach do not visit. I found this place really interesting. I am not a morbid person. But learnt a thing or two in here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tuit2013
20,Not for everybody,"So I love scary, creepy things... but even this was too much for me. It was more centered around serial killers and extremely graphic morbid pictures that were mounted on the wall. At one point of the museum I started feeling so sick. Not sure if it was too much for me or if I was just dehydrated lol but it was definitely gruesome. I would not recommend it to most people. It was over priced and not well kept. The bathroom was dirty, some of the mountings were crooked... just small details I noticed. I did like the skull exhibit but that was small.Overall it was small and not worth the price.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TirzahD
50,Gruesome But Worth It,"This place is incredible. Not for the faint of heart though. There are many photos of blood and guts, chopped up corpses and crime scenes. There is also a running film of an actual embalming. I did start to get a bit nauseous towards the end, it is a lot to take in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/642marlam
50,Highlight of Hollywood,"I couldn't wait to come here and it did NOT disappoint. There's a great collection of artefacts and oddities, take your time and look at as much as you can. I enjoyed the Manson Family area the best, and really enjoyed walking around and all sorts of weird and wonderful things. This was my favourite place in Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tristonford
40,Interesting Museum,Admittedly I have a morbid fascination so this type of museum was going to suit me. I had a great time here and learnt quite a bit (most of the serial killers etc I knew about already).I would suggest that all adults went here however be aware that there are a lot of photos of dead people.A great way to spend an hour or two in Hollywood,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fletchiekins
30,I'm not sure how I feel about this place…,"The day that I went there were very few people there… It is a very compact museum and filled with information on psychology, psychiatry, and the drug industry. There was a brief survey given at the end, but I was afraid to fill it out, because I didn't want them to have my name and address… It just felt a little funny. However, it was well done and captivating. You will definitely have something to talk about.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/daveholden
50,Great museum for every true crime buff,"As a true crime enthusiast the Museum of Death turned out to be the most exciting museum I've been to. Had to go alone as my friend had zero interest in the museum. It's definitely graphic and weird but for anyone interested in crime or oddities/weird stuff, this is your place. I love how much original things these guys have gathered. The items in the serial killer room were very interesting. For a mere 15 dollars you get to see a lot of cool stuff. Loved it! I am sad taking photos wasn't allowed tho.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tuyazh
30,ok too fixed on graphic pics,serial killer section good rest info i felt can pick up in general too much emphasis on graphic photos of people passed away in accidents recon 10 dollars fair entrance fee not 15,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peppersurrey
40,18 year old neice loved it,"To be fair we were well warned about the content and so do not regret going. Our whole trip to LA was planned around my nieces desire to go here for her 18th. It was far too much for me to enjoy. Initially the first room was really interesting, lots of reading and great items personal to serial killers. Unfortunately the images moving forward were too much for me. The film at the end was really graphic also.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Darbo1969
40,Super interesting,I had to cover my sons eyes a few times but the content of the museum was really interesting! The serial killer room kept us captivated.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jennifermP3871SW
40,Interesting but graphic,"It is not a big museum and very compact. The exhibition is impressive and has a lot of contents. I found it quite interesting but did feel some of the crime/accident scene photos would qualify as graphic image (CSI or other crime shows are nothing in comparison) so wouldn't recommend taking kids or for someone squeamish. Depending on how closely you observe each piece of information, it could be a long visit or a short one.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Meeyoru
50,Must see for those who can handle it,"It truly is a fascinating museum. Of course it's about serial killers, death and all things macabre, so unless you're sure you can stomach it (for somethings really are quite gross) I wouldn't go. That being said, the staff was amazing and actually would occasionally check up on everyone and go through the rooms just to make sure everyone was doing okay. It's a very different kind of museum, and I would highly recommend visiting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z997BCmaryc
50,Excellent!,"We came here in June but I've just thought to review now. Absolutely incredible experience, but definitely not for the faint hearted. I love a bit of gore and even I walked out feeling a little queezy. Incredible collection of true crimes/murders, executions, correspondence with convicted killers.... the list goes on but I won't give it away. Please visit this place. It's a great talking point!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MichaelaAus
50,Fantastic but not for people who get grossed out easily.....,"This place is fantastic! Not for the faint hearted, it contains some very heavy stuff. It takes a while to get around, which I liked because so often you pay for museums which you can get around in half an hour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P6500SOsarahb
40,"Super interesting, but not suited for anyone with weak heart, stomach and knees","Pros: The museum was definitely interesting and it had every death-related information in there. It also has free parking. (Admission is $15)Cons: I'm pretty sensitive when it comes to seeing bloody and gruesome photos of real murder scenes and fatal accidents, so I felt pretty dizzy and faint at one point. Before you decide to go, keep in mind that you WILL see a lot of disturbing things. Definitely not a place for kids.Lastly, you'll have to spend extra to watch a fun movie (we watched Inside Out) afterward to get rid of the heavy and gloomy feeling that came with the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/517kathryng
50,Will change your life.,"Before you say ""Yeah right.."" and roll your eyes. Read further. The museum was created to show you a new perspective on life itself. Yes, the pictures are gruesome and yes it's not for everyone. But when you leave this place, you'll be reminded that life is precious and easily lost. They go deep in the meaning of death itself. They show you artifacts and pictures. Disgusting ones as times. They explore the psychology of death and people chasing and causing it. It's not just a building with weird pictures. They actually teach you what death is really about. When I left, it made me want to appreciate what I do with my life even more. And no, I'm not one of those pro life person at all. I went for the gore and serial killer artifacts, which I'm a fan of. But I understood the meaning of the museum. I hope you will do too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NadiaLikesToExplore
50,"Amazing, quirky place","I loved this museum. It's bizarre, it's confronting, but it is meticulous in what has been collected and is absolutely fascinating. I am really surprised by the comments about a lot of the images/stories being available on the internet. Yes, there is a lot of information alongside the exhibits, but to look at every artefact alone would take several hours. There are John Wayne Gacy's actual clown shoes, along with several of his artworks, and those of a number of other serial killers, the horrifically stained clothing of a man executed by electric chair, vintage embalming kits, taxidermied animals belonging to Liberace and Jayne Mansfield, the Manson family quilt, shrunken heads, antique coffins, mourning jewellery, and items from the Heaven's Gate suicide cult. Saying you can get all this online is the equivalent of saying you don't need to go to the Louvre to see paintings because they're all online.The attendant was really helpful and the beagle at the door so lovely. It's fairly gruesome, however, so don't expect a sanitised or comical set of exhibits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/caterpillargirl
40,Interesting,"Came here on a Saturday afternoon with the wife. Free parking to the east of the museum, always great. $15 per person for about a 1 hour self guided tour. Lots of interesting articles to read and photos to look at it. Interesting perspective at death and those who commit it (serial killers). Got a bit crowded in the small rooms. Mostly a younger range of people, so expect a lot of childish comments. Overall a fun and new experience with the wife.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ErickMiranda
40,Do not visit if you have a weak stomach,"Wasn't really sure what to expect when we stopped there. Although our family is glad we stopped, it is not something for someone with a weak stomach. It's a museum of DEATH.....obviously there will be many things displayed of a graphic nature.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LaurieP441
40,Well that was interesting...,"Went here on a recommendation from an employee at Amoeba records. Very interesting place and never would have thought about this topic being a museum. They cover it all (murder, suicide, autopsies, burial...) Plenty of warning that this is not a Disney fun place, but truly a museum about the topic of death and it's history. Honestly a very interesting place, just realize what your are walking into. People working there are great and are more than happy to give some history about the place/topic. Lots of stuff to see and read all over the rooms/walls/ceilings. You most certainly will learn something new. Couple of the rooms have videos running. One about autopsies and how they are done, basically a training video for morticians. That room contains lots of tools of the trade from long ago. Many old caskets and funeral items and info of how bodies were placed or photographed long ago. Lots of stuff about serial killers and cults throughout the ages. Plenty of shirts and swag to purchase after your self guided tour to remember you were here.. Broaden your horizons and visit this unique museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jennifero55
40,Different and dark,"It's not big, but not as small as some other reviews would imply. There are a number of graphic images, but they're pretty upfront about that, so it should be no surprise. Take the time to read the information provided about each station - some of it is disturbing, yes, but also fascinating and well, that's kind of the point. The folks who run the place are super friendly and helpful and can answer just about any question you may have. The parking is free, but limited - if you go in the evening be sure to park on the same side as the museum, as there's a club next door.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cristal0505
20,Somehow not what I expected..,"OK, so I got that it was going to be gory and somewhat morbid, but I think I was expecting a bit more fun to go with it, perhaps like the London Dungeon. This is just a collection of artifacts that mostly consists of extremely gruesome photographs of real dead bodies, along with items such as letters written by serial killers. It feels more well-suited to murder-obsessed weirdos than those of us with an innocent touch of morbid curiosity!The museum works as a self-guided tour and is not very big (a fact I ended up grateful for!), but there is lots of reading to be done if you're really interested, so you could easily go straight through in 10 minutes just glancing at everything or stay for several hours if you were to examine every single photograph and read every word. Most 'exhibits' are fairly old and there was a sickly sweet cloying smell throughout the place that coupled with the images on show made me feel quite ill after a little while, so I personally didn't stick around too long (and I'm honestly not that squeamish in general!). I was also disappointed that you couldn't take photos inside, although I can understand why, as if you looked up pictures of everything that's there on the internet there would really be no need to go.On the positive side the guy working reception was surprisingly really friendly, happy to answer any questions and even gave me permission to take photos of the live Siamese turtles they have in a tank in the gift shop, that for me were the highlight of the whole thing!The museum is also a lot further from the main Hollywood strip than I imagined from looking at a map, but they do offer something extremely rare for LA - free parking!! So if you have a real ghoulish appetite and are determined to go, be sure to drive if you can.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LadyRose333
30,Avarage,15 dollars is a little bit overprised for a museum that is quite small and full of photos of serial killer and their victim that you can see on internet not impressed,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aniazasada
40,A well-compiled introduction into the dark and disturbing...,"For anyone who's never spent hours scouring the internet for the most disturbing images and topics out there, this is a perfect introduction into the world of death, torture, and suffering. I personally found this to be more of a review than a place for new discoveries, but the collection has obviously been curated by people who really care about the subject matter.My only gripe would be that some sections of the exhibit seem to blend seamlessly with one another. For example, it took a moment to discern where the Ed Gein section ended and the Jeffrey Dahmer section began.Otherwise, really well done: Great gift shop where I purchased several items for my friends. Extra attention to the Manson murders and authenticity of the Heaven's Gate cult. The real death film ""Traces of Death"" on repeat for viewing. My favorite part was the section of photographs right before re-entering into the serial killer art section: ""A biker bimbette decided that she'd rather be rid of her husband..."" Make sure you see that!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/flappym
40,Interesting...,"I have to start by saying I'd never have gone to this museum except that my teenage daughter picked it as the thing she really wanted to do on our trip. We read a handful of reviews online before going and there were some who mentioned they felt ill or passed out. I think I'm fairly average for tolerance and my daughter is only 16 1/2 and we didn't have any trouble getting through. If you're choosing to go to a museum of death, there will be gorey things to see. The two guys working there were super friendly and helpful and even checked on us partway through our self-guided tour through the exhibits to make sure we were okay and they told us they'd adjusted the a/c. We didn't notice any unpleasant smells or uncomfortable temperature. I had a couple of questions by the end and they answered them thoroughly and took the time to make sure I was happy. Some of the photos are disturbing, but that's not surprising. The gift shop was pretty good for shirt selection, etc. The free parking was a big plus. We did see one couple bring in a baby who I'd guess to be just under or around a year old, which I found a bit odd. The baby was facing outward in the carrier, looking at everything and it bothered me to think it might be taking some things in, but that's just me. I hope there is a strict age restriction for kids normally. My daughter looks over 18 and is mentally beyond her years, so I was okay with her handling it but I'd worry about other teens under 16 being allowed through.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tkpruden
40,"Morbid curiosity, satisfied.","An eccentric's extensive personal collection is on view for a reasonable fee, a little east ofHollywood and Vine.This isn't a high end, natural history museum, with slick, state-funded exhibits.

40,Worth the walk,I guess you need to have some interest or curiosity in Death/Murder/Suicide History to visit here.It was a bit of a walk from the hub of Hollywood Boulevard but worth it. Pretty basic premises a bit smelly(old items)but very interesting. The staff were really friendly & keen to answer any questions.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cma411
50,Fascinating,"I found the Museum of Death absolutely fascinating and interesting. No, it's not the normal type of museum to visit whilst on holiday but I would recommend for anyone who is a little bit interested in this type of thing. The staff were also very friendly and advise prior to entering of the graphic nature of the content.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/enjoythesilence123
50,"If you are fascinated with death, this place is great!","If you're interested in the stories and pictures of serial killers and celebrity murders and deaths, this is a place to check out. It's a ways down on Hollywood Blvd from the Walk of Fame but worth the extra effort to check out. The guy who works there is really cool!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HeidiD245
50,Not the normal Museum,This is not your every day museum. We were just going for a walk and found this. I love true story's and love the crime ones so this was very interesting. I would not take kids. Great to do smoking different.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/771323

Will definitely be going back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/25kaylap
40,Must see oddity.,"I think this place is definitely worth at least one visit. It's been a couple of years, but if the museum of death remotely piques your interest than you're in for a treat. There's something about death when looking at it in the abstract. It's morbid, it's gory, it's interesting. Spent most of my time in the large room displaying the autopsy as there are all sorts of morbid collections in there. The taxidermy room could use some ventilation or air purifier but that would be my only gripe. Don't forget to read up on the famous Hollywood crimes. They had photos on display I never knew existed. Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chrissjamess
50,Very Uniquely Morbid and I Loved It!,"Since this was listed as one of the top 1,000 Things To Do Before You Die, I had to check it out especially since I have a morbid curiousity. And I was NOT disappointed!!! Its located at the end of the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The small staff is very friendly and check on you to make sure youre ok and didnt pass out from the amount of gory, murderous, bloody, death that surrounds you during your self-guided tour. With that being said, its done in a ""tasteful"" way! From the serial killers articles, clothing of an American executed inmate and their last words, a room full of mortuary items including autopsy videos, random pictures of murder victims, Manson & Black Dahlia articles, photographs of executions from other countries.....and the last room of the self guided tour is a video of every kind of death being committed possible, nothing was uncut. I was just fine for the whole tour and loved it while my strong, weightlifting, masculine 25 year old son felt lightheaded by the end! PS. If you dont want to see certain things, simply walk by to the next area!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Miss_Tweeti
50,A macabre collection of curiosities,"This museum consists of one man's curious collection of items related to death, dying, and murder most foul. Here, you can expect rooms of serial killer art, clothing from those executed on Death Row, newspaper clippings on mysterious deaths, a room full of morticians' equipment, rooms dedicated to various death cults (including Heaven's Gate and the Manson Family), old PSA's on drunk driving, a canister of Zyklon B, a taxidermy room, photos of famous stars who committed suicide, and a room full of memorabilia from the life and death of late shock rocker GG Allin, in which an endless loop of ""Traces of Death III"" plays on a big screen TV. This museum, while not for the faint of heart or for children, is full of great conversation pieces, and is an authentic part of Hollywood's weird cultural scene. It's more fun to go with a friend (or a first date, which worked great for me -- my boyfriend and I went there for our first anniversary, too!) so you can talk to someone about your thoughts and reactions as you view all the disturbing material contained therein. Don't forget to check out the books, posters, and art in the gift shop if you want a truly unique souvenir of your visit to Hollywood's weirdest museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/theaf2018
40,Quick tourist stop on the way to Long Beach,"I had seen an article online about neat places to visit in the LA area, and since it was on the way to our main destination, my best friend and I decided to detour a bit to check it out. We weren't sure what to expect as there are not many photos of the inside due to them not being allowed, but we weren't let down. We both are very into things like this, not to sound weird but for educational and interest purposes, so we really liked this museum. The photos and displays were incredible in the darker sense of the word, informative, and really really neat (also in the darker sense). I thoroughly enjoyed the Charles Manson and Black Dahlia room as those are two interesting cases I've researched before. I would say, though, if you have a slightly weak stomach and are not a fan of gore, this probably isn't the place for you. The only thing I would suggest to be changed is the ventilation. It was REALLY hot in some parts without much air and made us feel a little light headed. But overall, I would definitely come back and spend a little more time looking at everything and reading the snippets along with the displays.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnnDisaster1321
30,Interesting,"Spent about an hour here, found it interesting but some stuff freaked me out a bit.The place feels quite eerie when walking around too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pinkgirl86
40,the morbid part of me loved it,"definitely not for everyone as many others on here have said. Gross, morbid and creepy photos and descriptions. the video of embalming was enthralling yet disgusting thinking of your loved ones going through that process. being a nurse and having seen my share of dead people, I was still taken aback by some of the photos. still in all, you know what you get when you walk in the door. a very eye opening and unusual experience",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emilyc209
40,not the usual tourist attraction in hollywood...,"a little creepy, but something different to do in while in Los Angeles plus they have a two headed turtle!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MichelleH791
40,Interesting,"Definitely not for everyone. Was very morbid and graphic, but very interesting and informative! And there are Siamese turtles and a dog to make you smile again when leaving!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Skibunny742
50,We loved it!,"We knew going in that this was not for the squeamish.... So we were prepared. There's so much information and tons of things to look at. I loved learning about the Heaven's Gate mass suicide. There were lots of videos I would have loved to watch all the way through but it was a busy day today. You can tell that it had taken tons of time, energy, and money to get this great museum to where it is today.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/797dyland
40,Interesting and uncomfortable,"This museum is definitely not for everyone, but I knew I had to visit because old Hollywood crime interests me. And my best friend is kind of spooky, so I knew she'd want a souvenir. Paying money to gawk at original artwork by John Wayne Gacy made me pretty uneasy, but I did it, so who am I to judge? There were definitely things I didn't or couldn't look at -- suicides and political executions mostly. And at least one part of the ""Hall of Carnage"" which featured some really, really graphic necrophilia photos. Or something. I fled! And watching a screaming man get shot in the face by a firing squad is not something I want to remember.A lot of the items displayed were interesting and creepy -- the Manson room, the Black Dahlia photos, the Heaven's Gate leader's video. I loved some of the ""humorous"" pieces like Liberace's taxidermied cat! And Jayne Mansfield's stuffed chihuahua. (Both donated by Anton LaVey himself!)Overall, the museum-lover in me didn't like how things were displayed -- the ""plaques"" as they were were reeeeeally long printouts of info. It was a LOT of reading. And lots of it poorly written. Itemas were really jumbled together and hung sort of haphazardly. I definitely agreed that the carpets reeked and it was ungodly hot and there were lots of mildew stains. I almost used the bathroom but decided against it.And, yes, a lot of this stuff is already online. So make the experience nicer for people who actually come out. Some fresh paint, new carpets and a real curator's touch would make this a better museum. I will also say that the man working up front was friendly and gave us a nice ""Enjoy the rest of your life!"" as we left. Cute.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scifigirl
40,Brimming with Info - Not for Everyone,"The curators here obviously took a lot of thought into organizing these collections into an interesting and informative way. The collection is brimming with photos, ephemera, and objects such as coffins (showing different coffin types), skulls, and a wide variety of odd objects.There is a lot of stuff about serial killers and murders in general (Charles Manson, a local character, gets a whole room of his own.) I appreciate the cross-referencing, too (whereby, for example, Jeffrey Dahmers gets a nod in both the serial killers and the cannibalism exhibits).Many photos are very graphic and will disturb and offend some people, so this isn't a place for someone who doesn't like this sort of thing. There are quite a few displays that beg for additional information (dates, names,etc. or in a few cases any type of label/caption).We spent a couple of hours wandering around. There is a lot to read and take in. The free parking in the back is convenient and plentiful. There are many restaurants and other places to explore in the area.Staff is helpful and enthusiastic. Small gift shop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oldhousegirl
40,Unique experience. Well worth a visit.,"A very unusual museum I have ever been to. I was very impressed with all the details and how very well planned it was. The owner's have painstakingly created this museum and you can see it from all the items they have gathered. Beware that there is a lot of gory materials and images and is not for the faint hearted. I would highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a different experience and is not afraid to see blood and mutilations. It also makes us feel grateful for being alive, sane and in good company.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelSwag84
50,Fascinating,"I didn't really know what to expect when we went to the Museum of Death. I had read about it online and knew it was definitely somewhere I wanted to check out because I've always found serial killers and historic murders fascinatingly disturbing. When we arrived I liked the environment off right off the bat it wasn't fancy, there was a two-headed turtle when you walked in, and you felt like you were in a unique place off of the beaten path. The amount of information and stuff to look at could take hours, and I hope to go back because I know with the information overload I missed out on some things.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/317chelseac
40,"Standing Ovation for the owners bold ""Dare to show what America hides museum""","Quite a collection of older and more recent crime photos, info, videos, death artifacts...just frankly too much to list. It's not for everyone, but it is part of life so to speak. Some of the images here are the type you can see on rotten dot com but there are so many interesting collectibles I had no idea existed. The guy at the front desk/gift shop area is so friendly and extremely helpful. You can ask him anything and he is knowledable as well as enthusiastic.There is parking on the left side of the building, free of charge! In LA thats awesome. They don't rush you in or out, self paced tour, and there is plenty of tshirts etc to remember your visit, although I think I will manage to remember them just fine!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Michelle_Haley
50,"Morbid, graphic, and fascinating","The museum has different rooms which explore death in all forms. Letters from serial killers. Video clips on mortuary science,historical photos of different methods of execution.A room is dedicated to the deeds of the Manson clan and un solved murder of The Black Dahlia..There are autopsy photos of JFK and a grisly, black faced Marilyn MonroeThere is free parking in the back of the museum",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T5481QPadamb
50,Cool,We went with a open mind very interesting if you have week stomach not for you but if your interested in some crazy people then it's the right place,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StephenR3128
30,Amazing and kinda disturbing Museum,"Before you enter there,check the warning and please care of it!The museum show us so many artefact related to serial killer.Im a bit confuse about it,Its like offering a cult to those guys(in a way we shouldn't) and at the same time i cant deny that the collection was so impressive.I enjoy the medical part of it,really interesting.The museum is mostly related to brutal death,serial killer,suicide than the death itself.Not enough stuff about the whole stuff.The main problem i got is ..is it ok to show those image.Is that respectful for the familly of those dead people?I dont think that's cool.Mostly the cutting body couple that put the hand in the nose of his victims.At least when you enter to the museum you know what you pay for.The truth is human will always be fascinating and curious about death and gory stuff.I enjoy it at the same time not!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sam333lion
50,Can't miss!,"If you're a fan of true crime and don't mind the gore, it's a MUST SEE. Relatively cheap admission, free parking, and amazingly interesting artifacts, photos, and displays. I went to Vegas/LA for a week (bounced between the two) and this was by far my favorite attraction. Being one of the true crime weirdos, I had read about a lot of the cases previously, but there were also many that I'd not yet researched. Info on murders, autopsies, accidents, suicides, Manson, Dahmer, the Black Dahlia, methods of torture...I could have stayed for hours if I'd had time/a chair.The ONLY negative is that the gift shop was small and overpriced. But the museum itself was awesome.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clearing_boxer
50,AWESOME,I love it.. Never before seen all this interesting stuff all in one place at the same time.. Must see.. I brought my nephew and he wants to go back!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jasonberti
30,Average,"Visited here after reading previous reviews on trip advisor. However I don't see why people say they got queasy and that its not for the faint hearted....... or maybe I'm a bit twisted!!! Loads of memorabilia and interesting letters and drawings from real life serial killers. Short tour but you could spend hours there reading all the articles, letters, etc. Would visit if you were in the area but don't go out of your way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/darren1702
40,WOW!!!! Interesting yet a little freaky!,"We visited LA for the first around this time last year. This place really made us think!........... interesting and scary! The lovely man that assisted us was extremely helpful and was very excited to mark us on their world map as the first ever to visit from Adelaide, South Australia. We walked in it was all very very interesting, original notes written by serial killers, photographs etc etc. There was one section of the museum I personally could not stomach, which was fine (left my husband to it and moved on). I seriously enjoyed the museum. Would definitely recommend (for those not too weak stomached) to check it out. Definitely glad we did!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/654sarahm654
50,"Super interesting but kind of short, still worth a visit","The guy working was the nicest person I met on my trip to Los Angeles, very accommodating(we had a 4 month old in a big stroller). This museum is not for the faint of heart but if you can handle real crime scene photos with blood, and gore go! I loved it. So interesting, my favorite was the mass suicide room. I also liked the art by real life killers like Charles Manson. The museum was a walk away from my hotel, so the location rocked. The shirts they carry are also cool, you can also get different oddities to take home.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/616savannahj
30,Not for the faint hearted,My family dragged me here and at $15 per head it's over priced & I'll never get that hour back! What a waste of time really.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Happywanderer_aus
20,Overpriced,Decided to check out the Museum of Death because of the good reviews online. Found it overpriced for what it's worth. Some of the exhibits were interesting (like the mass suicide exhibit) but I found that there's more Google-able text and pictures than exhibits.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kathc2014
50,Must See...If You Can Handle It,"Went to LA for my first time. Upon doing some pre-travel research, I found out about this museum of TripAdvisor, with so many good reviews about it, we decided to stop by.Upon arrival, the outside of the place grabs your attention. It is overgrown with ivy, and has a unique entrance sign. We where greeted by two very nice people working inside, they asked us where we where from and we had a nice small talk before going inside. The amount of care put into the exhibits here is amazing. You could spend HOURS reading and studying everything they have. We spent a good 45 minutes inside.They do warn you before you enter, there is ALOT of gore and intense macabre stuff inside the museum, so I warn other people who are reading this and interested in going. There are loads of emotional stuff like funeral related caskets, ie-even a infant casket. So go inside prepared you will be bombarded with death... hence the title of the place!If your in LA, have a macabre interest, or just want something shocking and fun, I highly recommend the Museum of Death.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hgtravl
40,Very interesting!,"There is so much information in here, you could spend hours. We took about one and a half. It has good historical information on funeral homes, embalming. There was a room with serial killer memorabilia (an interest of mine) so I spent some time in there.It's not for the faint of heart. I'm usually pretty sturdy with stuff as I am a nurse and have seen things. But there are death scene photos which are pretty graphic (if anyone remembers the website Rotten.com you will know what I'm talking about). This attraction is only for people who don't get grossed out easily or who enjoy the subjects of serial killers, death, embalming methods, etc.I got a take a couple of souvenir post cards and bought a magnet (I'm a collector). I would definitely go here again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/965amberk
40,Does Exactly What it Says on the Tin,"My review may sound a lot like the others on here.There is so much information in this place that you could literally spend hours reading it all.If you're a fan of the macabre, I would definitely recommend it.I am very interested in all the things that were in this museum, but I must admit, even I felt a little squeamish looking at some of the pictures and reading some of the materials.My friend and I decided to re-name this place ""The Museum of Happiness"" to overcome some of the things we saw.However, all in all it was a really interesting place to go. Although I'd maybe recommend that teenagers/easily disturbed people should stay away from some segments of the place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BeccaG788
40,The Name says it all.,You could spend hours in this place just reading the information they have on the walls. From the first room that is all about serial killers to the room covering mass suicide to the video and photos all about embalming and different funeral rites it delivers exactly what you'd expect and maybe a little more. It is definitely a very interesting and educational place to visit if you are interested in such things. I would recommend this place to any of my friends who were visiting L.A.$15 entrance feeFree parking in the backNo photos or video on the inside.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lyn_Blue_13
40,Great for those with a morbid fascination,"This is an insanely intriguing museum, my partner and I were fascinated with the huge range of artifacts and stories they had here, if you have a morbid fascination with the insanity of some people then this is a great place to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/woodinnes
50,"Coolest museum ever, not for the faint hearted though!","This is an essential place to visit for those fascinated with the morbid side of life and the dark side of humanity. There is everything from serial killers, rooms devoted to suicide cults, animal and human bones and murder scene photos and videos. Be aware though that there is a strict no photography rule which is fair enough. Oh and when we visited Michael Rooker (Walking dead, Days of Thunder) was there with his family so keep your eyes open, you never know who you'll meet!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Voodoochilled1
50,Very cool,"That was a very cool museum and well worth the $15. I had never been to a place like this before and I am glad I went! If you are into these kind of things, you should definitely go! I learned a lot about serial killers and all kinds of death related things :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LostRealist85
50,"Interesting, very interesting..",First time visiting the museum & was well worth the 15 bucks. Saw things I've never seen before in my life. If you're into serial killers & dark things I would suggest seeing this place for yourself.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Northern_Ute
50,Super amazing!!,Went with the family!! Mom and cousin loved it. There was some crazy stuff In there. But that was expected! Very graphic information and pictures. Expect to stay a long time to really take advantage of all the info! They also have some cool videos to watch that are pretty cool.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FayeR899
50,Museum of Death Hollywood,"Wow what an interesting self guided tour. If you are looking for something unusual to do while in Hollywood. When asked the host how he was doing, he said ""I am a live"", which is a great way to say welcome to the museum. The museum takes a different spin on death with a focus on serial killers and their methods of madness to a room called ""Putting the fun back in funeral"". There are a few Hollywood stories of stars death.There are graphic pictures and stories, and would not recommend this to tour for children.It was fun, different and interesting to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelforfun2009
30,"Was good, would have been better if longer","It was interesting, to say the least. Has paintings by John Wayne Gacy in there - sort of like a mini alternative art gallery! For a museum, i think it would have been better if it was bigger, and more organised, so that the user doesn't have to do so much reading. I think if this aspect was adjusted you could easily spend a full hour there. But as it was, I went through it in half an hour. Maybe i'm just too lazy to read so much. I agree with a previous comment here that it should have been 10-12 dollars instead of 15. However due to the location and subject matter i assume they cannot attract enough visitors to secure a lower price.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vingummi
40,So...much...death...,"I love all things crime TV so I was really excited about going to this hidden museum. My girlfriend and I had a great time, but please be aware there are some really graphic elements about this museum. Even the hallways are decorated with death paraphernalia! They have everything from serial killers to taxidermied animals and even a hallway devoted to drunk driving deaths. I was surprised at how much knowledge both the exhibit had as well as the employees. Definitely a must see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LitttleBeee
30,Morbid,"The exhibits were interesting. However, it seemed more like a way to immortalize serial killers rather than expose ideas on death. The only part that was truly educational was the part on funerals. There is one room in the back that seems very satanic with crazy rock videos and lots of those stuffed deer-like animals that ""represent"" illuminati.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dbuttafucuo
40,Memento mori,"I went here last month with my fiancé; both he and I are people who are fairly interested in death, gore, etc. He's a horror film specialist, and I'm a longtime listener of death metal and grindcore who also enjoys horror films in a less academic context. We also enjoy true crime and books and films about all kinds of esoteric stuff, so it's fair to say that we are difficult to shock and horrify with discussions and depictions of gruesome, horrible deaths. That said, some of the exhibits here gave me the chills! It's potent stuff!The first room is devoted to serial killers: biographies, letters, art (including some by Henry Lee Lucas and John Wayne Gacy), and various artifacts. Each room has a bit of a different theme; while I don't remember each themed room in order, other rooms featured exhibits devoted to the industry of funeral homes and mortuaries, different cultures' and eras' rites and rituals around death, murder, mortal accidents, suicide cults (including a copy of the video left by the Heaven's Gate cult and the letter they left), the Manson Family, deaths of celebrities, celebrities obsessed by death, celebrity murders, the Holocaust, other genocides, and taxidermy. Now, to me, the taxidermy, the paintings by the serial killers, and the canister of Zyklon-B were the scariest parts of the museum -- I really got the willies from them! However, I also got comic relief from the portion of the celebrity exhibit devoted to GG Allin, and felt rather instructed by the section about mortuaries. Finally, as you are about to leave the museum, you can stop and sit in a theater playing the seminal snuff classic Traces of Death. Um, if you want to, that is. I only spent a couple of minutes watching it... it's a bit hard to watch. My fiance is not into that at all, so he left me in there and went out to the lobby.The gift shop offers shirts bearing the museum's logo for all ages and sizes -- including onesies!! -- as well as tote bags and other collectibles. There is also a fascinating selection of used, sometimes quite rare books that deal with the subjects covered in the museum's exhibits.In short, if you are fascinated by gore, the sinister, the macabre, various deranged personages throughout Western modern history, and the generally outlandish aspects of death in the Western world, this is a fun place to spend a couple of hours. If you are more interested in an anthropological examination of different cultures' practices related to death, there is very little of that here. I would recommend not spending $15 here if you are looking for that. In fact, I feel more like this museum is worth $10-$12 than $15, which is why I knocked off a star. We only got a couple of hours' worth of entertainment for the price we paid, so I feel the price is a bit inflated. However, we do read very quickly, and we knew a lot about these topics beforehand, so we may have plowed through the exhibits more quickly than some people might. The staff are friendly, there are a lot of rare items and tons of information in here, and you are supporting a small, local, mom & pop business by going here, so I do think it's worth a visit for those of you with strong stomachs. Sadly, it is not really well-equipped for wheelchair access, so that must be narrowed to people with strong stomachs who are fairly able-bodied. (Guys! Get on that! People with reduced mobility like spooky stuff, too!) Perhaps this goes without saying if you have already read my review, but this place is not appropriate for children. There is a lot of violent, downright scary content here. Consider it R-rated. So, able-bodied people with strong stomachs not accompanied by people under 16 or 17 or so.If that's you, and you have a bit of free time in Hollywood, by all means, check it out!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/theaf2018
30,interesting!,"This museum was very interesting. They show you a picture prior to entry at the museum of the aftermath of a woman being hit by a car to give you an idea of the intensity of what's inside. If you can't stomach the picture, they recommend that you don't go in. For people interested in serial killers, there is a John Wayne Gacy painting, and some letters written by serial killers including Richard Ramirez and information about the Manson cult. There are a lot of photos of suicides and murders, human and animal skulls and a room with a looping video playing with lots of different images / clips of deaths. The rooms are well laid out and organised. I was skeptical before going in about how the museum approached this topic in general, but I found the owners very respectful and they mentioned to me that they thought it was important for people to be educated about death and for it to not to be treated as a taboo subject. I think all the serial killers stuff in here is just to draw a crowd, but the other parts of the museum were quite educational, particularly the video about the embalming process. Keep in mind that the majority of things in the museum are photos/letters/newspaper clippings. Some of the images were very confronting, so I would warn that some people might find it traumatising. I also think you have to be over 18 to enter.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DrKazzawazza
30,A little too sensational,"Was hoping they had more about death, but seemed to mainly concentrate on murder and mayhem. Even at a museum supposedly about death, there was surprisingly very little about death itself and our attitudes and rituals around it.But if you are interested in mass murders and other gruesome aspects of death, then it is worth a visit. Would be nice if there was more narrative to go along with the artifacts.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wmleler
40,Human cruelty exposed,"Museum is very well organised, it tells you are story from the moment you enter until you exit. Story is building up from funeral, to maniacs and ending with mass murders. Accurate facts and interesting facts. The only thing that is bad and very disturbing is that is all true, makes you think about us humans and cruelty we can commit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NorthFood
40,As Sadistic as You Want it to Be,"I have to say, this museum was just about exactly what I expected it to be. It had enough information to be interesting while not overwhelming. There were enough photos, letters to inmates, serial killer art to make it a truly unique experience. Much of it felt one of a kind and very likely you won't see personal letters to inmates like these anywhere else.A couple of hours here was perfect and there's just enough sensationalism to feel ever so slightly creeped out but never over the top.Definitely not for kids or anyone squeamish - the displays get more graphic as you go on and there were a couple of things I couldn't bring myself to look at. However, those were the exception to the rule.All of the rooms are well organized, laid out, properly maintained. All of the TVs have the perfect background atmosphere presentation sounds and most of them were worth watching for a couple of minutes.You know if this is your kind of thing and it lives up to exactly what you think it will be.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeremyD863
40,"Challenging, disturbing, fascinating","I consider myself to have a pretty strong stomach.. but there are definitely things in the Museum of Death that I found hard to look at.The exhibits begin with a room dedicated to serial killers, featuring things such as their art work, their personal history, news articles, photographs. Other rooms cover funerals, autopsy (including video!), mass suicide, gruesome murders such as Black Dahlia and twisted murderers. Very graphic real photos.The most disturbing thing by far, however, is the video running in the final room featuring murders, suicides, war and mutilation. Uncut and uncensored, I imagine these videos are akin to something used to train army marines for combat to de-sensitize them to shock.Negatives: it can get a bit hot, and some places look crammed, dusty and crowded. There are no windows. The embalming video is disgusting but really boring.Overall, this is very definitely worth seeing - if you can stomach it! It's educational, very interesting and totally unique. I'm glad I saw it, even the hard stuff.As the receptionist said to me as I was leaving, ""Have a nice life!"" Having seen all that stuff, I definitely will.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DestinationVictoria8
50,So good! Loved it,"Its quite small but has so many authentic pictures and letters to see and read, I loved it but could see its not everyone's cup of tea. Also the guy there has a siamese turtle joint by the shell she's awesome!! Loads of great real dead things animal and human, could have more signs to explain more about some things on show but great all round.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alicinn
30,Pretty cool place,"This place is just chock-full of death memorabilia. It actually wasn't as gory as I was expecting, after reading some reviews, but I work in an operating room so nothing really fazes me. I thought the film running on a loop about embalming a body was incredibly boring and showed absolutely nothing of interest. I did like everything else though.However I have one complaint about one item included: In the area dedicated to cannibals (or cannibal killers) they have a display about the Uruguayan rugby players who crashed in the Andes in 1972. I really don't think that they should've been included since they didn't cannibalize by choice. Nor did they kill anyone. But that's just one person's opinion and didn't take away my overall enjoyment of the place. I could've easily spent more time here reading every little article on the walls but my husband was getting kinda bored.Also, really loved the very friendly owner's beagle lying around the front of the place. :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/goddess0063

40,very interesting place to visit a bit disturbing though,"not the run of the mill museam, its all a bit over whelming really, so much information so many distrubing pictures which illustrate the frailty of the human body, Also a great deal of information about serial killers and cults which is facinating. well worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SlimShaneo
50,Interesting... just the facts.,"It may not be everyone's cup of tea but it is very interesting and you have to keep an open mind. There is no judgement, just provides the facts and stories of various murderers, victims, accidents pictures etc. The guy who greeted us was very friendly and chatty and provided information on other activities and sights.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CdnTrvlr62
40,A history of death & dying,"A short walk from the Hollywood & Vine subway stop, this museum is full of the macabre as well as the historic. A room dedicated to serial killers is a highlight for the macabre, and funeral displays (including a video of an actual autopsy) provide the historic. Cost is $15, although coupons are available in many tourist publications.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KSFF_jane
50,Very Cool!,"Although not as shocked as most, I was very intrigued by the material included in this museum! Manson, The Black Dahlia Murder, Autopsy photos and the video of preparing the dead for funeral was most interesting! JD was very welcoming and sincere! Would visit again upon our return to LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/smcameron
30,Interesting but lacking,"Son and I enjoyed, but feels like something is missing. Lots of typos on the descrtions. Manson roof is sparse...not enough background or history about Tate-LaBianca, Bugliosi, or cultural relevance, or even the trial. Serial killers section very cool, but again feels very home-made, lots of clutter without good movement around the room. black Dahlia - never really knew history of this case, was glad to see this.Not a bad way to spend an hour or so...don't forget to see the Siamese/2headed turtle up front.Also not for squemish",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bryan_S
50,Exotic and Fascinating!,"I’ve been told I had to see the Museum of Death on Hollywood Blvd. by friends and I’ve had it on my must see list, and I’m happy to report I went and saw! It is fascinating!! I highly recommend checking it out and asking the owner as many questions as you may have about anything. He’s great and very much available. We’re all heading that direction (death) anyway so why not know more about it?? I learned how to do humane hanging, learned that it was customary to send hanging postcards, and how embalming is done. There is a lot more, but those things rang my chimes. There is a plethora of information on serial killers, articles, magazines, photos, and even some grizzly blood-stained items… but all that is just so much novelty from everything else that is really impressively handled and presented. Not for the squeamish or fearful and they will clearly point that out before entering. Don’t hold back!! Check it out! Oh - and no photos.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DoctorBuckles
50,Totally Freaky,My sister and her hubby took me here on their recent visit to Hollywood. This place is just sick Pictures of car crash victims autopsy photos dead celebs displays of taxidermy and shrunken heads rooms dedicated to Manson and cult suicides Halls with coffins and a room dedicated to dead babies. It's morbid it's graphic it's crazy and its cool lol yeah I walked out ready to vomit and yeah If this is your thing then I highly recommend it. The people who run the place are super friendly and super cool. Yeah it's 15 dollars to get in but they let you park for free and I have to say again it was awesomely morbid and gave me the creeps,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Darin_and_Christi
50,Morbid but very interesting!,"Found this museum was close to our hotel so thought we'd check it out. Glad we did it was very interesting with a range of different subject matters including serial killers, death penalty, photos of suicides and murders, sculls of humans and animals, death cults and a video with lots of different images / clips of deaths. Personal highlights were the exhibit on car accidents and post mortem / embalming. Also loved their siamese pet tortoise - so cuuute!Not for the feint hearted as it was pretty gruesome at times! But the guy is really friendly and shows u a test photo before you go in and warns you it will be grafic. He was happy to chat at the end about any questions you have and your favourite exhibits. He also offered to take our photo at the front of the museum after we left.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bullet25
50,Great museum but not for the faint hearted,"Initially $15 seems a little expensive but there is lots of exhibits and information on offer in this museum and it is worth the fee. There is lots of unique and graphic images and displays of various forms of death, including suicides, murders, car crashes etc - definitely not for the faint hearted! It took us around 1.5 hours to explore this museum. Worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gillian_Speed
50,"Very interesting, true and scary",My favorite museum of all time. It is so interesting that u wont fall asleep what most museums do. I defintely would come back for second time with other friends. I recommand u to visit if u are open mind :),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/laboy251985
50,"A cool, off the beaten path for those not grossed out by death but fascinated with it.","A short drive from the Chinese theater, this musuem has a very intresting presentation of death. It contains very real pictures from car crashes and police scenes. Also it has very intresting informative pieces relating to serial killers, cults , and excutions. Its not just things you can find on google but letters from serial killers and paintings and sketches. Also a room of items acquired from the heaven's gate cult. The staff is super friendly and accomdating.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/James6rob
50,"If you are into gruesome, but done in a tasteful way, don't miss this!!","Fantastic. The highlight of my trip to Hollywood, after seeing Judy Garland's Star. The gentleman working there was courteous and helpful. The physically smaller museum is packed with informative, well done information and displays on everything from Heaven's Gate to a normal embalming. Do not miss this. And as the gentleman said to us as we left, ""Have great lives.""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/behindeverycloud
50,"Well worth the 15 chips, but made my tummy hurt","this place is very unique and very interesting. My wife and I are into visiting unique and off the wall places. This was just right up our alley. This was unplanned visit and was last min. We went in right when it opened and the guy at the front counter was very friendly and informative.. Again he was a cool dude and made you feel at ease. He did warn us that if we couldnt take the visual horrific exhibits that we can always step out and come back. He also gave us some water for our venture within. The place was stuffy.... After about an hour and a half we threw in the towel and called it quits.... Too much to handle and we felt ""uneasy"".... AND I have a strong stomach, but just felt odd and funky after viewing all the images and stuff... My personal fav was the richard ramierez letters...If your into this type of odd ball stuff then go check it out.. $15 per person with free parkin in the back, cant beat that! Whoooo hooo!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Santa_Barbara_Native
40,Horrible but compelling- you can't look but you can't look away...,"The museum is a rather airless, low roofed series of interconnecting rooms in a white one storey building close to Hollywood and Vine. it could have been the lack of air that made me feel faint, or the subject matter- it's a weirdo collection of car crash photos, murder photos ( check out the lady sawing her ex's head off, for a start), stuff on famous cases like the Black Dahlia, the Manson murders, other serial killers and their art work, types of execution methods, photo of beheadings from China in the early 20th century...autopsy procedures, coffins of varying designs, displays on wacko cults like Jim Jones, a tawdry room of stuffed animals, and a room, viewed through a glass partition, of lots of different skulls...I must say a number of the rooms gave me a very unsettled feeling and like the Museum of Torture in Prague, after entering it I kind of wished I hadn't, but I did like this one more....it's certainly worth visiting as it really helps you understand that ""noir"" underbelly of LA....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/khmersrei
50,Not for the weak stomached individual - SO AWESOME,"The people at the front desk were super friendly - after our tour the guy showed us some things that had just arrived and were not yet in the exhibit!There is a lot of interesting thing here - obviously to do with death.... there's a serial killer room with letters, artwork, clippings, etc. there's a room about embalming, there's photos of car crashes, charles manson photos, articles about suicide bombers, killers... Anything to do with death, you will find it here!NOTE - If watching an episode of CSI makes you feel icky - DO NOT GO HERE!Also, try not to drink just before going in, there's no washroom :( at least we didn't see one....Be prepared to read, lots of the items in there have some sort of story attached... There is one video - how to embalm!Overall VERY INTERESTING!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dawne_n_travis
40,"Good and informative, but got a little weird!","When you enter the museum it looks exactly like how you might imagine a death museum to look, dark colours, and lots of grim merchandise. The staff on the front desk were lovely and very helpful too. The museum itself started out really well and was really interesting, though there were a few exhibits that could have done with more description and not just pictures because I didn't know what they were.All of the museum was great, until we reached the film room that made the place seem a little disrespectful to be blunt. We didn't stay to watch the films because there was loud heavy metal music playing and a kid head banging whilst watching a video of what I think was a person being pulled out of a car wreck (dead of course.)All together I thought the place was really interesting if not a little grim, but I think the films at the end should be changed to inform rather than entertain.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SSmith0106
50,Definitely something different!,"I actually stumbled across The Museum of Death on tripadvisor and I'm always down for something off the beaten path. I personally really enjoyed the museum. I think it was rather intriguing and there is something interesting about delving into the minds of serial killers and other twisted things. Although the room dedicated to embalming made me slightly queasy, I actually liked the science of all of it and learned something new.On the other hand, the museum totally turned my husband off. He said it left him feeling slightly disturbed and creeped out. He said he also felt like someone was going to abduct us since we were the only ones in the museum at the time and it does leave you feeling like you are in a horror movie at times.Overall, I would definitely recommend the museum. It's not like any place else I've visited and it was just so different. The owner was also extremely friendly and I'm sure more than willing to answer any questions you may be left with.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mopogra
30,Creepy and not for all!,"So while looking on Trip Advisor for suggestions on where to take a friend who was visiting LA, I stumbled across this little place. As a joke, I mentioned it. To my dismay, my guests were super interested. Sigh, great. Admission is $15 per person for a self-guided tour. You are shown a test photo prior to entry to make sure that you can handle to gore that you will see.The place is small but jam packed with pictures, videos, and displays. The first room is the serial killer room, which was pretty interesting. From there, it just gets gross. The next room is the funeral room, where they have a video playing that shows you how to embalm bodies. There are super gruesome photos in the rooms to follow, which were gross. My friends were studying every single picture in detail. Eww. I couldn't. The last room was like a mini-theatre that continuously shows disgusting, gruesome videos of car accidents, murders, etc. While I'll agree that some parts were pretty interesting, I just couldn't get over the photos and videos. I cannot explain the awful feeling I had while in there. I just can't imagine the appeal in seeing these horrible things. I couldn't wait to get out of there. Another super creepy thing: there are side doors pretty much in every room and the staff were walking in and out of these doors...maybe they live there? Weird. Anywho, I'm not saying not to go, because to each his own. It just wasn't for me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tigersbbfan
40,Fascinating Collection of Morbid Paraphernalia,"When you see an ad for a museum like this you have to wonder if it is authentic or if they are just trying to milk you for money. I'm happy to say that I thought it was fascinating. Their website says it is a 45 minute self guided tour but I was there almost 3 hours and could have spent more time reading all of the information. I am very interested in the topic and have a strong stomach, but some of it was surprisingly disturbing. The guy at the front told me they have had many people faint in the past. Check it out--it is worth the time and money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lizardtiff
40,Stroll Hollywood Blvd. and ponder your own mortality,"For me, this museum is far greater than Ripley's or Madame Tussaud's tourist traps. Your self guided tour starts with artwork of serial killers. Fascinating stuff. There lots of other ""themed rooms"" like car accidents, cannibalism, executions. The Funeral room held my attention the most. I've wanted to see the embalming process for many years. So I got more than my money's worth by viewing the professional training video which detailed all aspects of preparing bodies for funerals. The Heaven's Gate display was rather chilling. Made up of genuine articles obtained from San Diego. Which I believe was the original site of this museum. Quite a few photo displays appeared to be printouts from the old ogrish.com website (now defunct) and newspaper clippings. But there was a lot of stuff I had never seen before.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mimicry
40,Interesting and the owners are very friendly,"My husband and I visited last week because he has a fasication with serial killers and what makes them tick. The tickets are $15 each and although I wouldn't have paid that much if I were on my own, my husband very happily shelled out the $$$. It is self-guided so you can take as long as you like to meander through the rooms.Parking is easily accessible and if you go in the evening, after the clinic next door is closed, you can park in the ""clinic only"" parking spaces, but make sure they're closed. It's a shady looking joint from the outside but once in, you are welcomed.Read the other reviews and you will get a very detailed idea of what is displayed inside. I won't go into all that but I do want to say that as a middle aged grandma lady, it was not as gruesome and gory as many people think.If you've lived this long, you've seen slasher and horror pics and lived to tell about it. Maybe you've seen the 'Hostel and Saw"" movies...if so, NOTHING you see in this museum will blow you away or even turn your stomach.All the different rooms with the various topics are interesting and such but at the end, I left feeling very sad for humanity. Much of the materials displayed are printed off the internet, old newspaper clippings, letters, notes etc. The pics shown are gross, sure...IF you are a 10 yr old kid who has never seen a horror movie.Because of the feel and vibe of the place, I honestly felt as though I was walking through someone's personal collection ~at home~ so I never felt creepy or rushed.The Charles Manson room is ultimately one of the saddest displays I've ever seen and there is even a 'funeral' room which I was fascinated by. At the end of the tour (and there is a restroom behind the heavy velvet curtain by the Manson room) there are movies which are looped over and over.There is an electric chair in that room, a coffin and a couple of couches and chairs.I'm not sure but I think that the movies are from the ""Faces of Death"" series or at the very least, seemed to be movies we were shown in high school in the new driver classes.I bought my husband a very cool tshirt, cc are accepted and the owners are lke everyone else said, super friendly and informative.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CBTL2019
40,fulfilled my morbid curiosity,"I must admit I was a little hesitant/ nervous to go inside, given the reviews that I had read about having to have a stong stomach to see this museum but after stepping inside, all my worries went away. It was a very interesting and surreal environment. I loved the serial killer display, and loved all the gory and disturbing photos. this museum is a definate must see!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/taranm
30,Gruesome,"Very graphic exhibit about different forms of death including electric chair, the Mansons and cults. Not for the weak ones for sure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AG162
50,Extremely interesting and enjoyable,"While visiting Hollywood, this place is a must-see. Though not for the faint of heart, it serves as a fascinating escape from the glitz and glamour of the surrounding area. When we visited, we were welcomed by one of the friendly owners of the museum and told what to expect- at the front desk there is also a gruesome photograph depicting the remains of an unfortunate man mutilated by a truck which also gives you an idea of what you'll be dealing with. The museum is organized very well- the rooms are 'catergorised' so that there is a room all about serial killers, executions, embalment, etc. They contain eveything from fun facts and newspaper articles to photos of actual crime scenes and many artifacts like autopsy instruments and shrunken heads- the works! The people who run the place are very friendly, knowledgable (one of them even corresponds with many of the serial killers and visits them in jail- the letters are also displayed!) so be sure to shoot them a question or two. Overall it is a very intriguing journey and certainly made us value our lives that little bit more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Liberafan
30,you need a strong stomach for this one,"We came across the Museum of Death via a brochure which was prominently placed in the lobby of a very upmarket hotel, along with air balloon trips, Getty Villa, etc.The museum is in an easy to access location, right in the middle of Hollywood. It appears to be closed at first glance, but I think that is only to increase the sense of suspense that one gets knowing that the contents will be very graphic.The front desk was manned by a fellow who couldnt be nicer. His hobby is writing to and visiting death row inmates to collect stories and artefacts for the museum, but he was cheerful and open, and happy to answer any questions.Under the front desk is a very graphic photo of a man versus truck accident scene, which has resulted in, umm, some scattering. They have it prominently displayed to warn off those people who can't cope with difficult photos. By the end of our visit, I was left contemplating the fact that the front desk photo was tame in comparison to the museum contents! They have a lot of artifacts and letters from serial killers, including an infamous John Wayne Gacey clown portrait. they also have a very interesting exhibit on the history of the undertaking business in the US, and on the practicalities of embalming.Much of the remainder of the museum, however is devoted to the most gruesome, graphic photos imaginable. They include murder scenes, mortuary and post mortem photographs, photos from the black dahlia case, famous suicides....The photos were on one level interesting, particularly in relation to illuminating the truly horrible things people regularly do to each other, but I left feeling faintly voyeuristic and greasy, like I was looking at things that were no business of mine. I suppose that the museum illustrates the fact that there is no privacy in death.Overall, if you are interested in death and happy to view disturbing material, you will very much enjoy the museum of death. If you are not sure about your stomach- probably not.And by the way, the owner told me that people pass out here on a fairly regular basis.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lindalou086
50,VERY GRAPHIC & MORBID...I LOVED IT!,This was a very interesting museum. If your stomach can't handle extremely graphic pictures/information/videos DO NOT GO IN!!!! There's a whole room dedicated to autoposies and mortician's instruments!!! It's really graphic and they have videos playing the whole time!!! It has a lot of information about a lot of the famous crimes committed (Charles Manson to name one). They have artwork/letters from serial murderers and a wall that has original crime scene photographs! The last room you go in before you exit has a ton of newspaper articles for crashes and murders and even stuff from 9/11!!!There's really a lot of information! You could be in there for 2-3 hours!They offer free parking and it cost $15.00 to go in! It was worth it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lullabystar
40,Graphic and extremely interesting,"This place is not for the faint of heart, which is why they show you a picture of something you might run across inside of the museum before letting you enter so that you know what to expect. There are real artifacts of serial killers, accidents and murders. There are famous cases and unusual death scenes. Lots of pictures. Lots of displays. I spent a long time in the museum (although not long enough) & spoke with the proprietors who were super nice people. They love what they do & it shows. I even bought t-shirts in the gift shop! I recommend this place highly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/omahagurl
50,Gory but great,Really enjoyed our visit hear. The owner was full of knowledge and was really friendly. Full of interesting info on all the serial killers Inc letters and artwork. A bit gory but we loved that. Only 15 bucks with free car parking. Well worth a visit plus it's located at the end of the walk of fame. Buddy the beagle is great too!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Danny_and_Bronia
40,DEATH DEATH DEATH !!!!!,"wow pretty crazy There's nothing like it !!! i mean if your not up for Gore and the macabre then i wouldnt go at least not alone !, when you walk in your greeted by a friendly staff ,after you pay $15. you enter on your right there is room after room of death photos, videos. a large viewing room set up like a funeral parlor with movie projected screen. allot of real props dealing with death ! there's plenty to see . its worth seeing . I felt weird after leaving because your faced with so much death it makes death a reality !!!! oh there's free parking in the rear which is great !!!!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ocmddude
50,Fabulous hidden gem of a Museum!,"My husband and I had gone to the museum about 2 years ago. We loved the place. We must have spent a good 2 1/2 hours browsing, reading & gawking. The owners have done a wonderful job gathering relevant materials & documents & pictures to go along with many famous deaths like the Black Dahlia, Manson Murders and the Heaven's Gate cult mass suicide. The have a wonderful assortment of funeral home paraphernalia. And they have an actual, real, severed head of the Blue Beard of Paris in a display case! For those of you who are into the ""Faces of Death"" movie series, their mini-theatre will be good for you. They are always playing movies in there of various things. Last time, I remember walking by the doorway to the theater, and I saw someone get hit by a train. That wasn't my forte necessarily, but it does add to the ambiance of the museum.I think my favorite was the photos on the wall of a man & woman who had killed this guy and decided to break out their camera and snap shots of the killing & mulitation, only to take their film to a photo place to get developed (way before digital cameras!) and the photo place called the cops after seeing what developed! Like, duh!! Criminals can be so stupid sometimes! And of course, the museum curators have the photos and story on display. That is awesome!They have ample parking in the back, and a restroom if you are hanging out there a while, it's nice to know they have the facilities. They have a nice gift shop you can buy tshirts, mugs, shot glasses, videos, etc. They have a dog on premises that is sweet & mellow and may follow you around a bit. Oh, and ask to see their two headed turtle!We ended up bringing my mother in law when she came out to visit from Texas in January, and she loved it too. And we were fascinated about how much we missed on our first visit, when we were walking through with her. Take your time and take it all in. Yes, it is a little morbid, but we all eventually have to die. This museum allows you to come to grips with your mortality, and makes you hope that you don't die like alot of the people in the exhibits did! Definately a must see in Los Angeles!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/toatiedog
30,Intimate and morbid!,"This place small. The corridors are narrow and it's by no means a fancy and strategically well-arranged museum.Although all of the displays are crowded because of the place's small size, it still boasts a variety of interesting things like a mummy or two, skeletons, animal taxidermy, funeral paraphernalia, execution devices, and lots of visual and informational treats for those with a taste for the morbid and macabre. There are rooms with walls covered in propaganda, merchandise, articles, and uncensored crime scene photos related to serial killers and famous murders. Definitely enter at your own discretion!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jennagenio
