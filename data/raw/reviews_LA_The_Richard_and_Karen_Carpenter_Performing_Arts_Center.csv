50,Not a Bad Seat in the Theater,"We were fortunate to obtain discounted tickets through an online discount ticket company. This was our second time finding reasonably priced tickets for a superb performance. The first time we saw West Side Story, and this time Ragtime. We attended a Saturday matinee.Parking was $10. The crowd is primarily older and the patrons dress in nice attire. Everyone is very pleasant, to include the event staff.The theater is in immaculate condition. Each row is staggered above the other, and the seats are offset so one doesn't look at the back of another's head. My only complaint is it would be nice to have an walkway at the halfway point of the aisle. The acoustics are excellent.We have been in every major theater in the Los Angeles, Orange County area, as well as we have seen plays on Broadway. One can't go wrong seeing a performance at this theater.",luv2trvlRedondoBeach
40,A very good regional theater,"I've been here several times, including last night. There is some cool Carpenters memorabilia in the lobby. The theater itself is open and spacious. The acoustics are excellent. The seats on the floor go from one side to the other; there are no internal aisles. So there is a fair amount of people who need to squeeze by you, The sight lines of the seats are excellent. Admittedly, I have only sat on the floor, relatively near the front. The staff are pleasant. I've not had a bad experience here. A local company, Musical Theater West, makes its home here. I don't generally want to see most of their ""season"" but they occasionally do some very good regional theater. I saw a nice reproduction of ""In the Heights"" here recently. Last night we saw ""Ragtime"". Both were very good plays/musicals and very well done. The Center definitely contributed to the experiences, with great music from a live orchestra and generally excellent facilities. The Center has its own shows too, which I've been to a few times. This is a very nice regional theater that has some shows are worth seeing there.",steviegjd
50,Masters of Harmony Brotherhood Concert,Parking charge is interesting at $9.00 per vehicle. Why not $10?We have attended several concerts at the Carpenter Center and the quality of sound exceeds every other venue including Segerstrom and Pantages. Additionally there are no bad seats.Donâ€™t miss the chance to experience this wonderful performing arts center. There are plenty of restaurants nearby for after the show.,KarenK518
50,Pleasant Theatre Venud,"We've attended a few events at this theatre and have found it to be quite pleasant. The seats are comfortable, plenty of leg room and they're situated in such a way that you don't get an obstructed view of the stage from pretty much any seat. The acoustics are good and the productions they bring in include many Equity actors, so it's definitely professional. There's plenty of convenient, close in parking (paid - cash only) and it's well lit.",Joanne W
40,Pleasant Small Theater,"We have attended a number of musical productions at this theater. It is not very big, but the performances are usually very good. Parking is ample, but attendants only accept cash. In this day and age it would seem like Long Beach State (who is in charge of the parking) would be able to have hand held card readers for parking payment.",dmhn
50,Great Venue; No bad seats.,"The Carpenter Performing Arts Center is a fantastic theatre on the north end of CSULB campus that hosts various types of productions. I was there recently to see a production of Bright Star put on by Musical Theatre West.Although I had excellent seats, one look around this theatre would tell you that there are no bad seats. The theatre is not huge, but also not terribly small. The acoustics were good, seats comfortable, and lobby was sufficient.The production was excellent and the actors were quite good. I had seen Bright Star twice before with Carmen Cusack in the lead role, and was pleasantly pleased with this casts work bringing this wonderful story to their stage. The sets and costumes were purchased from the original Broadway production, which definitely was a nice touch, especially the musicians shanty. If you've seen the show you know how important this structure is to the telling of the story, really a character itself.The musicians were top notch in this production, which is incredibly important for this musical to play as well as it does. If you haven't seen Bright Star and it's flown under your radar, I highly recommend seeing it.Tickets for this production are relatively inexpensive compared to musicals at other venues in the southland. Parking at the event is only $8.",Bubuflu
40,Great Resource in Long Beach,"This theater is on the grounds of CSULB, and the offerings are varied and always good. The venue for cabaret is cozy and you can dine pre-show on some very tasty food. The large venue is lovely, and the staff is very helpful. We have been many times, and have never been disappointed with our seats or the show.",Fearless730216
50,Beautiful venue!,Truly one of the best entertainment facilities in the area. There's not a bad seat in the house and the whole center is gorgeous. I love coming to the Carpenter Performing Arts Center.,DeeAnn A
50,New story about George M. Cohan Yankee Doodle Dandy,"I went to see this play because it sounded like a fun story. I wasn't disappointed. It has an old George telling his life story. The actors are all extremely talented . Theater offers different plays and music offerings every year. They have angel groups that support new actors with scholarships and music programs for young children to learn to play and perform as well. In the lobby of the theater is a museum of the Carpenter's memorabilia. This play offered discounted tickets for some shows and for certain areas of the theater. If your a theater enthusiast, I would recommend joining this theater by buying season tickets.",charitywalker
50,Fabulous musical theater presentations,"The Musical Theater West uses this facility to present their outstanding shows. Each season they have a series of theatrical shows that are amazing. Everything about them is excellent - the production, the cast, and the theater. We sit in the last row of the theater and see and hear without any problem. There are no polls interfering with your view. You can see perfectly from anywhere in the theater. There is no center aisle to get to your seat but there is plenty of room to walk by those already seated. The acoustics are very good too.The price of the shows is very reasonable considering the quality of the presentations. To find out more information about dates, shows and prices you go to Musicaltheaterwest.com. You will love these shows. We have gone for several seasons.",GrandmaDi
50,Excellent Venue with Decent Acoustics,"My husband and I were here for the first time last weekend to see Mummenschanz perform. We were impressed by the collection of Richard and Karen Carpenter memorabilia and by the interesting architecture of the building. The interior of the performance hall is well lit and spacious, the seats are mostly comfortable, and there seems to be no bad seats from which to view the stage.Parking is ample around the performing arts building and available for events for a small fee ($8 while we were there). And getting in and out before and after the event was so easy with no wait. We can't wait to go to another event here.",JLFERG
50,Just perfect!,"I am a HUGE Carpenters fan. We didn't actually go here to see a performance. I wanted to tour the building and view memorabilia. I was not disappointed. Our tour guide was so nice and let us take our time looking at the exhibits. My love of the Carpenters was instilled in me by my late mother. She would have been in heaven. The exhibits are small, but still wonderful. If you are a fan take a few minutes and pop in for a tour. They have gold records, Grammy's and other memorabilia on display. It made my whole trip!",801bdw
40,Beautiful facility - but...,"This is a great space for the performing arts. We recently saw Mary Poppins there and we enjoyed the show. We sat about half way back, yet still have a very good view of the stage.The only issue with this space is that there is no center aisle. Our row had over 50 seats, other rows had over 60 seats. That means that if you are sitting in the middle, you better get to the show early, and return from intermission early unless you want to climb over a lot of people's legs. Seating capacity would be reduced by adding an aisle in the middle - but patrons would be oh so thankful!",bsimonis
50,love the venue,"We went to this theater for the first time last night and we were not disappointed. The center is beautiful, the sound is wonderful, the volunteers that help you find your seats were all very helpful and friendly.We saw Carousel last night and it was wonderful. The music could not have been better. Billy's character and voice pulled you in to the show. The most outstanding voice was the fisherman, Mr. Snow.I can honestly say we will enjoy this venue again.",grpandnana
50,Outstanding Performance,Just attended Carpenter Center with a friend to see Evita. The performance and singing where outstanding. We attended the matinee easy parking (cost $7) after the show go out for a nice dinner.,Patti O
50,Great Performance,"All of the performances are of the highest quality of musical shows. Easy parking, excellent staging, high quality performers and excellent price for a fun night out. If you like musicals give this a try.",Patti O
40,Ladies restroom can accommodate a crowd.,"The Carpenter Center hosts a variety of performances from dance to comedy, musical theatre to individual musicians.And it boasts 1057 seats in the theater.....and a 20 seat/stall restroom for the ladies. Now you wonder, ""why's she reporting that?"" because most venues are sorely lacking in this accommodation....they guys have ample space here too. Just saying as I""ve been in a similar sized theatres that had only six stalls for the ladies and needless to say during intermissions....precious minutes were lost waiting in line...so the performances may appeal to you or not, but you won't be uncomfortable due to lack of restroom facilities.",Dagnytags
40,Not a Bad Seat in the House,"We have been to many performances here throughout the years and just love the venue.Plenty of parking, lovely lobby with memorabilia worth taking the time to see. Here's a plus for you Ladies, I've NEVER had to stand in a cue to use the facilities!The seating area is well planned, in my opinion, seats are comfortable and have plenty of leg room. Good line of sight from all seats, the place is large to host theatre crowds, but small enough to feel intimate. Acoustically on point.Didn't give it 5 stars because bar/ snack area needs to have greater variety and needs to be bigger to accommodate the crowds.",selewynnb
50,Excellent Value,"I've had season tickets for the past six years, the quality of the performances, actors, staging, music are Excellent. Parking is only $5 vs driving to LA in heavy traffic and pay $20 to park. I attend a lot of plays including going to Broadway in New York paying $240 per ticket so the Carpenter Center is an Excellent value in both cost and performance.",Patti O
30,A tribute to their music,"We were extremely grateful for the generosity of the Manager, who personally welcomed overseas travellers visiting his centre ! We were given a guided tour of the facility and enjoyed seeing the gold discs of yesteryear proudly on display. Pity our tour guide was too young to recall the Carpenters fabulous music ! But we were very greatful for the courtesy extended to us during our visit.",Ian B
50,Musical Theater West productions are FANTASTIC!!,We regularly visit this theater and have never been disappointed. MTW puts on top of the line shows with seasoned actors and actresses. They have a wide assortment of productions every year from old classics to new hit shows. Definitely worth the price of admission. Broadway theater at an affordable price....Love it!!,Bzymamacee
50,Always Classy,"The Carpenter Center is such a wonderful place to enjoy a show, there is no such thing as a bad seat anywhere in the room. You're guaranteed to enjoy.",Pointlessly
50,Excellent Performances. Excellent Facility. Additional focus on free,"The Carpenter Center is amazing. It has a phenomenal assortment of theater... Sunday Afternoon Concert Series, Cabaret Series, Wit and Wisdom and many other categories.Lily Tomlin was amazing.I can't wait to see George Takei later this year.Arts for Life Program offers activities and theater arts for everyone for free. What a great way to be inclusive and provide opportunities for everyone to enjoy the theater.",gmeredith
40,Excellent facility and great programs,This place is intimate with comfortable seating and great acoustics. We saw Sister Act here last night and it was great.,ianbeavis
50,"Great venue, amazing talent","Since the theater is in a local state college, I expected a show by amateurs. Boy, was I wrong. We saw ""My Fair Lady"" and the actors were incredibly talented! The theater was full and the seats and acoustics were excellent as well. During intermission we became subscribers for the remaining season.",17suzan17
50,Don't miss My Fair Lady performance!!,"Went to The Richard & Karen Carpenter Performing Arts Ctr. in Long Beach, CA on Sunday, to see My Fair Lady, a fabulous and most entertaining show. If you have the time to go, I'd highly recommend it. Everything about it was spectacular and very professional. The performers were outstanding as were the costumes, singing, dancing and scenery. Overall it was a most enjoyable time.",Johanna W
50,Loved it.,"The sound in this venue is wonderful. Roomy seats. Easy parking. Friendly, helpful staff. I've been here several times. Sometimes its more economical to travel here than to see any show in Las Vegas.",CarlaStone
50,Great Venue,"I have been here for a number of concerts, the seats are roomy the sound is great and the parking is easy. There isn't a bad seat in the house. The only negative is the lack of enough restrooms.",Wingdam
50,Outstanding Venue,"You don't have to go to downtown LA to find a fine classical music experience. Also, if you liked the Carpenters, there is a museum-type showcase in the lobby of awards and memorabilia of the music duo. I was particularly interested in the sheet music on display. Plus convenient parking out front for only $5.",Carolyn440A
50,Love this place!!,"Shows are top notch, mainline actors/actresses, sound and seats are outstanding, and parking is great. We've been here numerous times and will continue to go!",dmdobler
40,Not a bad seat in the house,"My husband and I have been going to this facility for many years to see musicals. They have an excellent sound system, good parking and any seat is a good seat due to the size of this theater.",gojojogo
50,a must to visit if you are a carpenters fan!,"I always dreamt about going to this place, finally got a chance to stop by and see the carpenters exibition, see all those things that are part of music history was simply awesome",Cesar R
50,Wonder Theater!,The seats are amazing. You can see from every where. Also you can see over people's heads.Plenty of leg room. Great theater and performances. Just as good as any theater in the city or better. Saw Beauty and the Beast. Wonderful cast. They were all very talented. I have seen this musical three times at various places. This was one of the best performances.,clacdancer
50,Our new alternative to The Pantages,"Thanks to discounted tickets on Goldstar.com, we recently visited the theater to watch a performance of the musical Beauty & the Beast held by Musical Theatre West.The performance was off-Broadway calibre and we were pleasantly surprised with the quality of the performers, props and costumes. The theater is very comfortable and there isn't a bad seat in the house. And the theater is much more convenient for us, living in the South Bay area, than The Pantages in Hollywood.Parking is great (compared to the Pantages), and there are also many good restaurants just a few miles South along the harbor. It's on the campus of CSULB, so the neighborhood was nice and the streets were spacious. We're considering purchasing season tickets!",WanderLust Mike
20,An Accessibility Nightmare,"This facility was built before there were requirements to accomodate the handicapped. The parking spaces are fine and there is barrier free entry to the building and restrooms but the auditorium is a nightmare in all ways. Rows are 60 seats across, no center aisle so you have to pass over all the other people if you sit in the middle. EVERY row has 2 - 3 staircases minimun to access the row. They also jog at angles from each other making it visually confusing. Some entries to rows adjacent to handrails are only 18 inches wide. The ushers are very compassionate, and will park people's walkers downstairs for them. But the sight of senior clinging for dear life to the handrails to try and hoist themselves up 12 steps - it was almost like MOnty Python. Plan very very very carefully if you have elderly or handicapped in your party. Also, there were a whopping 25 headsets for the hard of hearing for a house of 1300 . It is very clear that management is clueless on handicapped accessibility.",Reenactress
50,Great Show!,"If you are in Long Beach any of the first three weekends of November, you have to go see ""Young Frankenstein, the musical"". It is a great cast, wonderful choreography, incredible music and gorgeous theater.",sbtraveler132
50,Great Theatre,"This local theatre is a wonderful exerience. All the seats are good, the entertainment is top notch and the prices are reasonable. We have season tickets and enjoy the plays very much.",Karen S
50,Local Gem,"The ticket prices are not cheap, but are reasonable. Parking is usually $5, sometimes free. They have a wide variety of performances, from music to guest lecturer/author/musician. No freeway driving involved for us Long Beach residents!",AmeliaAirheart
50,No bad seat in the house!,A great place to watch a dance show or anything else on stage. The rows are placed so that you can actually walk past people in the same row without them all having to stand up. Great acoustics,Pat T
