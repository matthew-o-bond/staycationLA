50,A dream made real,"Motoquest provided our motorcycle for a 2600 mile trip from their base in Portland to Long Beach... I ride a Triumph Nightstorm in the UK/Europe... but as me and my lass were venturing out onto a USA road trip we went with the ""all American"" experience of hiring a Harley Electra Glide Ultra Limited ( Big Blue as it became known). The trip was planned through a UK operator Magellan Motorcycle tours. Down 101 and route one to SF...onto the Yosemite and Southern Sierra...death valley, Vegas, Hoover dam and Grand Canyon...Laughlin via 66...Joshua Tree, Mojave, Ortega Highwat etc..etc... Even before we had arrived in Oregon Kelly and the rest of the team had helped us arrange a suitable bike...2017...sea blue...40,000 on the clock. It was the largest of the 7 bikes on the tour...others opting for BMW's.The bike was perfect, yep it was clunky as I expected a HD to be...but it kept us safe, never faltered in driving rain and even snow in Oregon...kept us warm in death valley (LOL it was more akin to riding a log burner in 36c heat) at the end of the trip I was sold...the HD we had was half of the experience...I now understand why HD is the bike of the USA ( wee tilt of the hat to Indian too). The bike was well maintained, well shod...if I had had the cash I would have bought it when we dropped it off...Out of all of the experiences of such an undertaking a couple of things will last with us for a lifetime...firstly the people of America are amongst the most welcoming and friendly I have ever come across...nothing is too much, and that started when we picked the bike up...Motoquest people are ambassadors for the US .. the service they provided was A1...to such an extent I would recommend them to all who wish to follow...thank you Motoquest , thank you Big Blue, Thank you US citizens.Blown away as we were with the internationally known places such as Yosemite, the grand canyon, death valley etc... it was the redwoods of Oregon and the Southern Sierra that made the most impression... riding up to one of these gentle giants on Big Blue was for us the all American experience...Motorquest provided the means and the USA provided the backdrop to what was for us the best of times...the greatest of all of our many travels...Tell Motoquest what you want to achieve and they will give you the ticket...Thanks to you allKarl and Lorna..and BIG Blue.....",Karl
50,"Fun ride, good customer service!",Nice and easy rental experience. Staff was knowledgeable and stored my suitcase during the trip. I did have a flat front tire but it was fixed in about 2-3 hours from when I called it in with the included roadside assistance. Had a great time and saw a lot of CA on 2 wheels!,Logan V
10,Do NOT rent from Motoquest,"I phoned and rented a BMW in Los Angeles on Thusday Fedruary 8 for that Saturday/Sunday. The next day, the weather forcast showed rain all weekend. I called back and cancelled the rental. They said no problem. After checking my Visa bill for next month, I realized the deducted $325.65 from my account, and never credited it back. When I called Motoquest back, the gentleman (Tony) I talked to said that they do not refund money back less than 30 days before the rental. I explained to him that I booked the rental a day before, and he didn't seem interested in helping me out. I asked if I could discuss this issue with another person, and he referred me to their ""info"" email. I asked if there was someone specific I could talk to. He said he isn't authorized to refer me to anyone, or able to offer any resolution. What a SCAM of a company. I will never do buisness with these guys again, and I do not recommended anyone else do either.Scott",Scott S
20,WOULD NOT BOOK AGAIN,"This posting is factual with no malice.Booked a BMW 1200 GS for two weeks holiday. Booking process and payment went well.When I booked I asked was there USB in cockpit of bike , told no and had to bring my own cable for this. I enquired at pick up why was this and told people steal them , well you cant steal them if they were simply attached to the frame which is a simple thing to do.Also on pick up I asked for the spare key , told only one key to bike because people lose them , well if one dose lose one , holiday ruined till they send a new one out to a postal address , crazy thinking that for me , give people extra key and deposit it.Also big problem for us , the luggage supplied could not be locked on the bike and you could not lock you stuff in the cases , so that meant the bike had to be in sight all the time as stealing from it was so easy , nightmare.When I picked bike up I noticed new tyres which was all good and one of the people at pick up point advise take it easy for first 100 miles which make sense.We left the depot and I felt the bike was a bit spongy , so called into very first garage and checked the tyres , should be 36 front 42 back , front was 28 and back was 34 , I was not impressed with this preparation , mentioned when returned the bike and they said we will have to watch for that , that is basic safety.Like to add , been riding and racing bikes for over fifty years , have built race bikes , tuned engines raced all over Europe and done thousands upon thousand of road miles so very experienced rider.I hope the company reads this and then maybe others will benefit from my comments.",gygo2384
50,Excellent Customer Service,"We used MotoQuest services to rent two bikes from Long Beach to San Francisco (20-26 April 2018) and we had an amazing ride. From Big Sur, Paso Robles, to Napa Valley and San Fran. Motoquest team Adam and Keegan were phenomenal from beginning to end. Picking up the bikes was a breeze, both bikes came with saddle bags and tanks full and it great condition to start our ride. The team should us every feature we had questions on and we were on our way. The drop off in San Fran was even easier, the team there inspected the bikes for any dents or scratches, a full tank of gas and we were done. I would definitely do this ride again but especially with Motoquest. Thank you Adam and Keegan for the excellent customer service. Francisco",Francisco
50,Rent a motorcycle and go have fun,"I borrowed a Suzuki V-Strom650 from MotoQuest to ride down the Baja California peninsula and back. They recommended this motorcycle, which turned out to be ideal for the purpose and also in perfect shape. The overall service was excellent, both friendly and efficient.",Peter T
