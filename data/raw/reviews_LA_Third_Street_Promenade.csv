20,Just 2 streets of shops,"Early morning stroll before it gets crowded, similar to Beverly Hills it’s largely just shops on both sides of the street with a mini playground in the middle for young kids, helps add to the family-friendly factor here.As I walked to the end of the street, I stumbled upon a weekend fresh food market. I assume it’s weekend only cause I haven’t read about it in any previous research.Interesting display of fruits and vegetables, saw some odd veg I’ve not seen before but too shy to take pictures of. The strawberries looked really good too, but they sell only in punnets of 3 or 6, which is too much for me as a single traveler.Done in 15 mins. Not worth the time if you ask me. Perhaps a good option for lunch or dinner after visiting Santa Monica Pier but otherwise, can skip it.",dyhx

I would recommend spending time at the beach (for us, it was walking on the pedestrian walkway) then walk around the 3rd street promenade to find a place to eat. Plenty of parking in several garages around downtown within a block or two of the promenade. We stayed at a hotel that was not walking distance but was less expensive, about 1.5 miles form down town and had no trouble parking and then walking around. Just take your parking ticket with you so you won't forget where you parked as the parking garages are city owned I think, and look alike.",goldsmanh

40,Lovely Outdoor Mall - Something for Everyone,"Third Street Promenade is a lovely outdoor strip mall perfectly located just near the Santa Monica Pier and ocean front. Of an evening all of the fairy/party lights come on and has somewhat of a romantic atmosphere about it.The gardens are manicured well and kept immaculate and there is a wide selection of stores from designers to surf shops, there is something for everyone here. Great for kids as they tend to have little activity areas scattered throughout the walk. And there’s so many eateries to choose from!Nearby parking is affordable and usually available, I have never not found a parking spot even on the weekends! The only real downside is the public restrooms are few and far between, I walked for about 20 mins trying to find one! Even Starbucks doesn’t have a restroom so more signage would be useful.Definitely worth a visit if you have time, dusk/early evening is lovely with all of the lights!",GeorgiaSZ

Right at the beginning of Third Street Promenade has a shop called Santa Monica Place (395 Santa Monica Place, Santa Monica, CA 90401), there you'll find stores like Michael Kors, Louis Vuitton, Nordstrom, Hugo Boss, Tiffany & CO, Bloomingdale's, Nike, Disney, among others, can even make a snack at Johnny Rockets, which has very good hamburger, and excellent milk shakes. There are many car parks in the area, I left in the mall itself, very cheap. Another call option is T.J. Maxx (1251 4th Street, Santa Monica, CA 90401) between 2nd block and 3rd street behind Third Street Promenade. In TJ Maxx there are macaws and more macaws of clothing from brands like Nike, Adidas, Puma, Tommy Hilfiger, Michael Kors, DKNY and others not so well known. They also have travel bags (I bought some huge cheap Samsonite for travel), backpacks, shoes, accessories and household items. It's a big mess and you'll need patience - even though the store is the most organized of its kind. Better prices than Outlet. There are many street artists who make the tour even better, very talented.",Hilberaldi

10,Homeless - don't go.,I have always loved Santa Monica - I grew up there. I went this last Saturday and was so dissapointed that the homeless have made it their home.

On a nice evening, it is just pleasant yet stimulating to walk these 2 or 3 blocks. Fanciful street lighting and music everywhere lift your spirits while midline eateries beckon. Window shopping is an extraordinay bonus. THis is NOT a place if you are in the mood for reflective solitude...walk a couple of blocks over to the palisades!",Kim B
50,Best place to shop in Santa Monica,"This is probably the best place to hang out in Santa Monica if you like shopping. Lots of good stores on a wide pedestrian promenade, prices generally within reason, cool restaurants with terraces, high quality buskers including one singer who should have been on a stage somewhere. The wife and kids loved it, but we did not stick together so everyone could go where they wanted. They wanted to keep returning and stay longer than I would have liked, but when I had had enough at the clothing boutiques, I lost myself inside a funky second hand bookstore called BookMonster just off the promenade on a side street (212 Santa Monica Blvd) where I picked up several great classics for cheap.",Praecox

There are a lot of homeless people who have very poor hygiene who hang out on the seating areas throughout 3rd street, and I'm guessing who also use the bathroom everywhere, hence the smell. Makes me not want to let my kids sit down on any of the seats due to this type of cleanliness issues. We also went to a public restroom there down a corridor and in front of the information booth...the disgusting smell of the restrooms slammed you in the face from outside and 20 feet away from the restroom entrance! By far, this in not the most pleasant shopping area I've been to and would not care to return.",jaymied2017

There’s a some restaurants for dining.

30,Not what we expected and lots of homeless and street performers.,"After hearing a lot about the 3rd St. Promenade on U Tube my 15 year old daughter and I decided to go while visiting Santa Monica for the day and to be honest we were pretty dissapointed. Yes there were lots of shops but it felt pretty dirty and we did not feel very safe although there were hundreds of people shopping and it was daytime. Lots and lots of homeless people (very sad) and street people performing with loud speaker systems and people preaching various things at every corner and the whole area smelled of urine. The promenade was not as aesthetically pleasing as I had imagined. We probably should have stayed inside the main mall at Santa Monica Place. On the plus side it was walking distance to the beach/pier so we parked at the beach lot ($12.00 for day) and walked up to the pier and then to the promenade which took about 10 min. Again be prepared for the above (homeless, preaching...) On the way up. If that sort of thing doesn't bother you too much and shopping is what you're after in that area then I say do it but be prepared. We also visited the Beverly Center and the Grove and preferred that much more.",AmyAllie

40,Lots of choices,"Fun outdoor experience with lots of restaurant choices. The sidewalk was clean, but the public bathrooms needed attention. The outdoor entertainment was fun, but some of it was loud and made conversing with family members difficult. Finding inexpensive parking was difficult too.

We did not shop but there was even a Tesla store in case you are looking for one!",Melaney68
30,Nothing impressive,"I didn't find Third Street Promenade that great but I am not a big shopper either. There were not a lot of people so we walked around, browsed in some of the shops and spent maybe an hour there before we decided to leave.

40,Love this area,3rd street promenade is an area where LA natives enjoy as well as tourists. It has a plethora of stores and restaurants. And it’s located adjacent to the beach. Pretty close to Santa Monica pier. ￼,Johnnyboydc
20,I Can't Believe How Many Stores Have Closed on 3rd Street Prominade,"To be clear, Third Street Promenade is a tourist trap. No cars are allowed on this shopping and entertainment area. Historically, there were some pretty good stores there that appeal to locals but now it is pretty much all stuff for tourists. It is amazing during a national, long-term boom economy how many stores have closed. Many good ones moved to the mall at the end of the promenade which is OK but lame compared to Century City. Locals shop on Montana now or on Amazon.",FlyersFanInLA

30,A sign of the times,"Third Street Promenade once was a fantastic open community mall space near the ocean. It was vibrant and had a lot of great places to eat, shop along with activities. Part of its appeal is that it is a communal place for people to gather. The Farmers Market still has a bit of that. But unfortunately it is a victim of the retail times. There are increasingly larger number of for lease spots along the Promenade. It has great potential to recapture what made it special a decade ago which is the communal gathering but in a different way. But for the moment it's a bit sad if you remember its hey day.",StationToStation
50,"Lot of Shopping, Lot of Social","If this was about the shopping only, I might rate it lower - it's true, you could find many of these shops in most covered malls. There is a scattering of other interesting names, some theaters, and places to eat. What makes this place great, is the way it takes advantage of the classic, walkable, sunny weather. the former street, given over to nothing but the pedestrian experience reveals how useful such wide expanses are. If nothing else, California is about people watching, and this place is made to order for that. Second, these days, would be instagramming and selfies - and there are certainly opportunities for that among the topiary dinosaurs, period style kiosks, art, and colourful street furniture. Knowing what this place was before the redevelopment, it also shows the power of smart city planning and design techniques to create walkable, healthy places for people.",John T

40,Great Evening in the Summer,"We have visited here several times and always enjoyed it. There are lots of restaurants , bars and shops. Also, many street acts keep you entertained. However, this time we were there in early February and it was pretty slow. Still had shops and street acts, but many fewer people and several stores had been closed. Not sure if it's just a winter thing or on it's way out. I will definitely give it another try when I'm in the area in the summer.",Pudditat

30,Shopping mall type stores at high prices,"Visiting family in So Cal, we were taken to the Third Street Promenade for what we were told was a unique shopping experience. It was unique, as the street perfomers displayed more hype than performance. One fellow spent almost thirty minutes working the gathering crowd to collect money. During this time he kept doing standing backflips, implying that his act would be some type of gymnastics with five visitors standing in a line nearby in the middle of the street. After pushing his collection bag at most everyone, he then crawled between the legs of the five ""volunteers"", took a bow and counted his money. Oh boy!",John F

50,Great Shopping,This is probably the best place to shop in the Los Angeles area with most of the major shops available and you are able to walk in 3rd street which has no vehicular traffic.

30,Ordinary,The shops are now largely chain type stores that one finds in upscale malls and they seem to have a large number of vacant storefronts .

20,Downhill,We have been strolling the Promenade on trips over the years and were very disappointed on last month's visit when nearly every shop was a national chain which we didn't need to fly to California to see. I'm guessing that the high rents have driven out the local independents. Too bad because without them it's just another generic mall.,834bob
50,Something to do,We stopped here because we parked close by. We found many fun shops and restaurants to check out. The mall area was pretty clean and not as many panhandlers hanging about. Plenty of sculptures to look at and an easy walk from parking and hotels.,OnlyMeDSW

There are some performers too but I feel like sometimes it’s a trap cuz they ask for donations and they put you in a spot. You keep on walking down 3rd street and it will lead you to the mall.

50,"Shopping, restaurants and close to the beach!","Whether you're looking for accessories, shoes, jewelry or clothes there are a variety of shops for both women and men.Favorite parking structure: Arizona and 3rd Street. It's away from the main visitors going to the beach and there's less foot traffic. *Look for the stairwell that leads to the promenade.There's plenty of hourly parking in several covered parking structures. Currently, you receive the first 90 minutes free and after that, you pay an hourly rate. Carefully read entrance signs as the prices can change.Wear comfortable shoes and clothes because it's an outdoor mall. There are buskers who usually sing or dance if you have time enjoy a free performance.Tip: Within walking distance, you can go to the Santa Monica pier and or nearby furniture stores. For the upcoming holiday season, there's also a skating rink nearby.",Erica Dozier
50,Another must-see if you're in Santa Monica,"Go to the Promenade to snack, or take in a movie (you never know who you'll see there, hint hint), or just get some coffee and people-watch in the sunshine. There are performers with crowds gathered around, anything you'd like for food to nibble. Of course there is shopping available - but Montana Ave, where the locals go, is better for that. Lots of free parking is available, too.",Startupper C
50,Touristy but great shops,"All visits to Santa Monica should include a wander along 3rd Street Promenade, which is full of tourists but includes most of the standard stores and restaurants. Easy to park and get to.",Karen C
40,Worth the stroll,Plenty of retail therapy on tap here and with the road closed to cars ideal for shoppers.

There are tons of great shops, and a few tasty restaurants to choose from. Or you can just walk around and enjoy the atmosphere. There are usually some street performers of some sort, and there are lots of plants and kiosks with food, etc. It's really nice and appealing over all. Of course, like everywhere else in Los Angeles, you have to pay for parking. Fortunately, there are lots of parking lots and garages surrounding the area.",FilmScoreComposer
30,"Parts are fenced off, good for shopping but not eating",We walked along here a couple of times on our trip. First in the evening looking for somewhere to eat with the kids (teens). Lots of the middle bits were fenced off so you couldn’t see the dinosaur fountains properly. We struggled to find anywhere to eat and soon found out it’s a shopping street with a few places that are really bars and not for kids. Went back the afternoon after for shopping though.,EssJayWhy
40,Lots of good things here,"The promenade has shops and restaurants of all kinds, and is usually bustling with a nice crowd of people. Shops range from high end jewelry, to the Apple Store, and normal mall eating locations. There are also some really outstanding restaurants on the promenade or in the attached mall or out on the nearby pier. Everything from hot dogs to haute cuisine.I especially like the cupcakes at Carlo’s (Cake Boss) bakery.",DavidVanM
30,"average shopping atmosphere, with overpriced clothes","I window shopped in this area and one of the anchor stores in July 2018. I had planned to update my wardrobe and buy a dress and/or skirt, several tops, new purse and a new pair of pants. I am a petite 5"" 3 , 62 yrs old and work in a casual work environment. I bought nothing. Too pricey and the selection was geared toward a young, Beachy, crowd. One of the anchors had no petite section. Many of the prices were more like rodeo drive.I was very disappointed. There are no target and/or walmart stores in Santa Monica. I even went to REI, but the prices were too high and after 5pm there was NOT a single sales person on the floor to answer questions. My husband really needed a pair of pants, but I could not get help with the sizing question and left. Extremely disappointing, especially as I had no car and walked or bussed to visit these stores.",Linda W
40,Absolutely Friendly,"Visited for the day, the local people are friendly and so helpful.

40,great pedestrian street of dining and shopping,"We had a great time walking the promenade and dined there twice during our time in LA. There are some pretty good buskers performing around the restaurants and that was fun. The shopping was good, if a bit more on the expensive side. It would have been nice to see less chains and more independents, but we knew what we were walking into, so it wasn't a surprise. A very pleasant area to spend time in, though and close to the beach.",LJ G

A few of these scooters flying around or abandoned on the pavement and that's about it.I hope they're not claiming anything too much for it, or people, I fear, will be disappointed. Traffic-free, though and a pleasant enough place to stroll and take the air.",Copey53

Its a must see if in Santa Monica and just a short distance from the Pier.",15receptionist
20,Combo of fun and nasty,On the weekends this place is absolutely overrun there's a combination of wealthy people tourist people and homeless people.There's a very apparent lack of police presence although I'm sure they're watching on cameras but there's not enough Security on the ends of the venue and in the Areas with heavy density.There should be people cleaning the streets and cleaning the trash and not allowing things to accumulate and to make sure that homeless people and people with shopping carts and dogs are well-behaved and not offending anyone else it makes no sense that I said you like Santa Monica would not have a much better presence of people cleaning and providing security that would be visible,Irvinggetthecar

Palm trees, no cars,variety of live music and restaurants!",travelchamp1

30,A surprise...,"You know the show, 'It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia'? Well, we travelled to 'sunny' Southern California, specifically Santa Monica. Among the few places we walked to was the Third Street Promenade.High-end and moderately priced stores line both sides of the street that include clothing and food establishments. In the middle of the street are kiosk-like booths selling clothing and chatychkes. Singers/musicians are also there your your entertainment.The not so sunny side of Santa Monica is there as well. Lining one side of the street as the evening closes in are the homeless, sleeping, waiting for the 'soup kitchen' to open so they can have their probably only good meal of the day, asking for a helping hand, and a couple, screaming at no one in particular about their frustrations. In the daytime, many of them move to the walk along the beach to get some shade from the trees lining the streets.",MattKauf
50,Skip Central LA and head to the coast,"All you could ask for without the hassle of driving from LAX spending hours in traffic only to do it all over again. Third street offers all the high street shops, restaurants, clubs, pubs, and of course the Pier, a must for all to visit. I’d suggest a rental car, which will not only give you freedom of movement, you’ll also save a fortune and time on Taxis and forget the Bus.

There are also musicians, singers and acts and all sorts along the promenade..At present the dinosaur topiary and fountains are being repaired.

Worth a visit.","Great place to visit - shop, catch a movie (several movie theaters), eat - just a few blocks from Santa Monica beach (you can see the ocean from there). Parking can be a bit of a nuisance during the weekend evenings - if you have a choice - worth taking the metro (recently extended all the way to the mall from within LA - ends right across the street from Bloomingdale's). Good on a nice day, but probably not when it's raining - as it is an outdoor mall - but as it rarely ever rains in L.A. - probably not relevant on most days. Go to the Santa Monica Pier afterwards. Note of caution - be careful right before you get onto the Pier - as there are some homeless people/most seem harmless, but some, you may want to steer clear.",ubbabe

There are a lot of empty storefronts and during my walk I noticed many empty restaurants . While this used to be a vibrant and fun area it appears that a handful of bars and the movie theater Are the only places that get any business.

50,Great spot!,"We just ran up on this spot while walking one night in SM. It was great! It felt very safe, even late, had great restaurants, cool shops and a famous YouTuber my son was dying to meet! Great spot!",Lindy031
30,Used to be Good,"Wow, went here on the Thursday evening before Memorial Day weekend. It was dead. We had to pass several homeless people. Shops were not even enticing after one trip in a typically attentive friendly store that didn't even acknowledge us after 10 minutes. Weird. Time for managers to work at getting back business and making this place nice and fun again. So many malls to choose from that I may never go back. If visiting definitely a summer weekend activity only because you were in the neighborhood for restaurants. Would recommend The Grove or Santa Monica Pier over this any day. Gave it a 3 only because I believe they still have entertainers at least on summer weekends, and it has been decent before. This trip though was poor, not worth the detour, and smacked of recession.",travelw411
30,Mall Stores in Outdoor Setting,"The stores you know are here (H&M, Anthropologie, Levi's, Gap...), as well as some jewelry and sunglass kiosks. Lots of aggressive sales people giving out samples and trying to get you in the stores. Good options for a quick bite to eat. Be aware that there are many homeless in this area. We saw a man punching himself in the face repeatedly and it was quite disturbing.",JJworkandplay

What I love about Third Str, that you could find almost everything here (great Sephora, Pacsun, Muji, Urban Oufitters, Steve Madden etc) plus Nordstrom, Bloomingdales with luxury shops like Gucci etc. So you really could go here on vacay getting both beach and shops within walking distance, yeah! Loads of places for food & drinks everywhere, and music - a lot of street misicians which sometimes ( on weekends) is a little bit overwhelming.

20,The smell of urine is just TOOOO MUCH to bear,When we visit Santa Monica we love going to the 3rd Street Promenade BUT our last visit maybe our last. The smell of urine as we walked along the promenade was just absolutely nasty. I was perplexed how people could sit outside and eat at some of the restaurants. After two blocks of the awful smell we headed towards Ocean Park and didn't return to the promenade.,josephine1996
40,Great place spoilt by homeless people,"This is a great shopping parade, with great shops and eateries. Beautiful lilac trees in full bloom line the street. The only thing that spoilt it was the large number of homeless people camped out on every chair and on every corner. Most of them are completely stoned and some of them liked to harass shoppers.",Cathyandpeterw

40,Definitely stop by if in Santa Monica,"We headed over to the Third St Promenade after spending time at the Pier. It's a super cute area of Santa Monica, with lots of cute shops and stores. We visited just before Independence Day and it was decorated with flags. There were also plenty of restaurants if you want to grab a bite to eat. The only reason for rating the 3rd St Promenade with four rather than five stars is that there was construction down the middle of the road, which had a negative effect on the ambiance.",traveler2901

50,Out for dinner and stroll.,"This is a great place to eat, shop, walk, watch, and listen. Several street type performers. I liked the beat laid down by a dozen or so Krishna’s.

40,Retail therapy after braving the crowds at the Pier!,Lots of shops and eateries to browse along the Promenade for some retail therapy. It’s a great place to explore after visiting the pier and the restaurants and cafes here are so much better than those ‘touristy’ ones at the Pier.,YChan2016
40,"THIS IS IT IF YOU LIKE TO WALK, WINDOW SHOP, EAT, OR DRINK, TOO MUCH","City closed the street off to cars and opened it up to walking, restaurants, shops, and a few too many street people.

20,Disappointed,"We were looking forward to our return trip after visiting 5 years ago; but it definitely has gone downhill.

50,Honestly just lovely.,"I really liked this area so much more than I thought. Yes, it's filled with lots of stores if you like to shop. Mostly I would say are overpriced. The real gem of the third street promenade are the musical performers. There are so many great performers in this area - those who sing, play violin, play guitar, etc. It was a joy. I spent a good amount of time here just people watching and enjoying the show. I would recommend that that you go!",Erica I

30,Get ready for homeless haggling,"I recommend if you come here to park and stay within the Santa Monica Place shops. There you will have ample, safe parking at a low cost and the center is safe and free of homeless people. You also will have a great view from the third level near the food court of the Santa Monica beach.The promenade itself is fine, it is an outdoor mall with lots of street performers, persistent beggars and homeless and street vendors, along with your usual eateries, some unique Santa Monica eateries and stores like Anthropologie.Really its a nice place if it wasn't for all the homeless and druggies wandering the alleys, it really takes away from the environment of this promenade.",Ashley S
50,Something for everyone,"I wanted to see the Pier and eat at a recommended restaurant in the area and this shopping district was in between them both.

30,Just not what it used to be.,"Used to have the newest in trending stores, now it is mostly a tourist type destination. I guess it should be a destination during the summer as the beach weather is sure better than the Valley or mid city. But, a much better vibe and scene at The Grove.",Michael M
50,Lots to see and do,"Lots to see and do. Plenty of shopping places and restaurants. Was there on sat morning and there was a farmers market. The key is to get there early on the weekends and get a parking spot in the nearby structure. Close to the beach also. Park in the mall parking and short walk to 3rd street promenade. Got there at 10:00 am , just as places were opening. Left at 1:30 the place was packed all around. You can eat and then go for a nice walk looking at all the stores. Movie theaters also.

40,If you like shopping and street entertainment,"If you like shopping, the promenade is a great place but many of the same chain stores can be found in any city so no unique boutique stores where you can find that one of a kind experience to buy and bring back home as a memory.

50,Lovely place to stroll and shop,So many lovely shops all within walking distance. Parking in public car park on 2nd street is free first 90 mins then only $1.25 an hour after that. Great place to park and so handy leaves you right out at 3rd street promenade.,gillm77
40,"Many time visitor of Santa Monica, 1st to the Promenade!","What a beautiful place to walk!

30,Mall Shopping in a Pretty Setting,"I enjoyed walking down the promenade simply for the aesthetics and location, but the shops are all basically the same as what are in a mall. We went in the winter, and the Christmas decorations were really nice. We meandered, grabbed a snack, people watched, and bought some mugs.",golightly1907

40,Under Construction but Retail is Alive and Well!,"I must have walked the length of the Third Street Promenade (back and forth) at least 3 times during my 3-day stay in Santa Monica. The number of top-level retailers located along this pedestrian way is quite remarkable. However, it appeared that there was a fair portion of the middle sections that were blocked off for renovation. I don't think I experienced it in its full glory, though at around 7pm on a Friday night, it was a very happening place with a remarkable number of street performers. A very happening place that should not be missed when you visit Santa Monica.",NellT

We enjoyed how every 100 feet there was a new performer and they area was fun during the day as well as the night. We felt safe at night. There is a nice mix of College students professionals and vacationers as well as local in this area. The out door dinning is why we came back at night. Really felt safe at night and the parking in the garage is easy and inexpensive for the area. We ate at a place that had table top smore making and it was super fun.,Julieanne H

30,Yawn to the Corporate Vibe,"This area is extremely popular. However I found it to be lacking in character and charm. The stores are mostly corporate chains and retailers. If you live in this area I’m sure you would enjoy shopping here in place of those antiquated indoor malls. As a traveler I didn’t find this place to be especially interesting. How about letting small businesses and unique shops flourish here, or perhaps those days are long gone. I hope not!",KevinsGirls
40,We enjoyed this location,"Have you ever been to a city and wonder why they don't close ONE road and turn it into a pedestrian walkway with shops, places to sit and enjoy a coffee or outdoor dining? Just a few blocks north of the pier is this location. We parked strategically on 2nd ave near Arizona with on street metered parking. We first traveled to the pier and then this wonderful location. No worries of cars, trucks, cabs and other vehicles getting in the way of your good time shopping, dining or enjoying the pedestrian space. Most of the cross walks offer diagonal crossing to assist you across the street to the locations you have spotted or are returning to an old favorite. Good for all any time of year.",Jerseybob175

40,Great shopping and great atmosphere,"It’s a great area to do some unique shopping while in Santa Monica.

30,Good find,"We stumbled upon this area after deciding we weren’t spending the day at the pier. We found a ramp that had free parking for 90-minutes then was reasonable charges after that. We found the area clean safe and delightful. It had a wonderful collection of shops - both national chains and unique stores. It also had a lot of places to stop and eat from snack restaurants, to linen tablecloth sit downs, to burger places. The street performers were a treat to watch as well.",MNmover

50,Friday night is a must see,"If you're in Santa Monica, you have to walk up and down 3rd street promenade on a Friday night. Apart from all the shops being open late and all the lights, you have the entertainment. We call them buskers in England but they are a little bit more up market and most are very good. It's an excellent atmosphere, people join in, the crowds dance and sing too. It would appear each act is.given a 20 minute slot on their pitch and then they have to move on. So you have, every 500 yards, some variety of entertainment. Then it's all change.",chrissandi

40,unique,"as one who has observed Third Street in santa monica evolve since the 1950s i have to express astonishment at the amazing success of the Promenade, if not undiluted admiration. It is indeed unique as a sort of outdoor international shopping mall, place of people watching and street entertainment - all very closely regulated. it certainly draws people as honey does flies, but there is a sort of impersonal feel to the takeover of big chains, etc. still, one should check out The Promenade and decide for one's self...",dl5490

50,"Fan,Fervour and Food","Third Street Promenade is a must visit for the tourist or any one visiting Santa Monica. It is the heart of Santa Monica downtown and along with the Santa Monica Pier and the State beach forms one of the most visited tourist attractions of Southern California. The Farmer's market on a portion of the Promenade itself on Wednesday and Saturday adds spice to its flavour. Three blocks of shops with varieties and affordability of products in many stores bear testimony to this fact as the visitor's are seen walking with large numbers of shopping bags. They are also seen flocking together,to enjoy the performance of the mostly amateur artists, even participate in their songs, dances and other lively acts.Restaurants catering to the pallets of every visitor make the Third Street Promenade a complete must visit place. I, being a local resident would like to observe the need of additional parking, particularly in the weekends which could be taken care of if the banks and offices would let their parking premises to be used for public.",Sufee Ahmed
30,To see and be seen,"There was a huge assortment of people enjoying the promenade. Performers played and danced as young and old, rich and poor, natives and visitors, attractive and ugly people strolled the short closed-to-cars 3rd Street Promenade in Santa Monica. Parking garages are close by and the beach is a few blocks to the West. There are plenty of eating establishments to choose from. Visit on a warm evening and enjoy the scene.",23Feb45

40,Pedestrian friendly shopping area,Located on a vehicle prohibited section of 3rd Street in downtown Santa Monica.

50,Always Interesting,"I live in Santa Monica. Going to the Promenade is a regular tradition for me, and it never gets tired or old. Pedestrian only; three blocks of shops; and an upscale, open-air mall at the south end.The mall is my least favorite part of the Promenade. I tend to ignore all of the stores except for the two anchor stores, Nordstrom’s and Bloomingdales. It’s other saving grace is the Multiplex cinema complex on the top floor.The three pedestrian blocks are always a treat. If you want a full, good meal, walk a block east to 4th Street, where there are a bunch of good restaurants. But, for a snack, a light meal or your obligatory Starbucks fix (there are two), the Promenade is fine. It is a popular place for street musicians (who have to be licensed to play there, and the number of whom can be there at one time is limited), so you might well have the opportunity to hear good music while you are eating. Or occasionally, really bad music.But, the main attraction is shopping, or in my case, mainly window shopping. That is where the Promenade really shines because it has a wide range of stores, in various price ranges. My wife, who is from Europe originally, had five favorite clothes stores in Europe. She already has added three more in the Promenade. Fortunately, none of them are high-end stores.I’ve lived in Santa Monica since before The Promenade opened. It’s never gotten old.",Michael B

50,Lots of activity and tons of shops,I walked around a lot of Santa Monica today and the third street promenade was one of my preferred areas. I stopped in a few shops but mostly just walked though and enjoyed people watching and being in a bustling part of town. The shops are mostly chain stores and I was looking for something more original or Beachy but the kiosks in the area had some fun beach items. I mostly liked that it was a pedestrian friendly area with a lot of people and activity. I went to some other areas that had been recommended for shopping and was not impressed.,SouthernBelles98

30,Typical Shops,The streets that make up the Third Street Promenade are typical stores found in your local mall. I was hoping there would be some local shops but it was only composed of commercial giants who could afford the rent.,Jackie B
40,Santa Monica Staple,"I've grown up around Santa Monica and this is pretty much a staple to the city. Driving around here can be stressful, especially near the holidays and summer months so be aware that it may take a long time to go down some of the streets surrounding it. Also during the summer there are many bicyclists and people crossing which also makes it difficult to drive. There are many parking structures with decent parking rates, but during busy times in the summer these can fill up and you might have to park further away. The actual promenade is pretty much just like an outdoor mall on a street. There are a lot of stores that you see a lot in regular malls, but there are more unique stores that are scattered in as well. They usually have late hours, which gives you the freedom to come later in the day. Most of the more popular stores are closer to the Santa Monica mall at the end of the promenade is where the department stores are. Then as you keep going down, the stores get more sparse and there may be empty store fronts. There are a couple of movie theaters with 2 AMC's, an Arclight at the end of the mall, and Laemmie which is one street over from the promenade. The tickets are a little pricier since they are on the promenade or close to it, but it's only usually a few dollars more than usual. Most of the places to eat on the promenade are pretty pricey, but there are a few fast places like bruxie, chipotle, and a pizza place next to the AMC. But most the sit down restaurants will be expensive. There are usually entertainers on the promenade which can be sometimes be fun to watch. Everything is outdoors, which makes it nice and makes you feel like you aren't really in a mall. Overall, you can shop, eat, and a see a movie which is the usual for a mall, but it does have the added value of being outdoor and entertainers as well as most of the stores are pretty good if that's what you are there for. Also, it's easy to visit the pier and beach from the promenade so you wouldn't have to drive again to do those things.",Holly T

My son had lamb, me and my husband, we had pizza, and my mother had a soup: none of us can't say that the food was at least enough if not tasty...so i do not recommend this restaurant...Except the restaurant not so nice experience, i highly recommend a walk on the Third Street Promenade",MadyLessing

You have your boutique shops as well as your usuals, but there are places to sit and watch the street entertainers, have a drink or go for some eats.

40,Vibrant Community Hub,"Festive crowds stroll through this shopping space at all hours. At the holidays the decorations are bright and tasteful. There are both local boutiques and chain stores in walkable distance. Parking garages make it easy to visit.

40,Love the shops,The shops here are great with some unique stores mixing it with chain staples. There’s also s9ne lovely bars and cafes . Good vibe too,Travelozzy
40,Nice shopping pedestrian mall,"It reminds me of Lincoln Road in South Miami Beach. However, the restaurants and cafes are mostly national chain. There are some interesting public artworks in the middle of the promenade. Though most of the shops do not look too interesting (as you can find most of them in other parts of US), it is sill a nice stroll after a day at the beach.",Saricie_Q
30,Too crowded,"We used to go there every week 10 years ago. It was amazing place to take a walk and see so many talented people performing. We haven’t been here for 5 years. Decided to go see one of our most favorite places in Cali and were very disappointed. Too crowded. Tons of people, everyone’s rushing, pushing each other. Just shopping, shopping, shopping. Not so many artists and performers. Like 2 of them. For us it lost it’s unique character. Unfortunately.",Anastasia T

50,Uncharacteristicly an urban downtown,"Uncharacteristicly an urban downtown in a Midwest styled City. Once called the Santa Monica of the Midwest, with still a lingering drawl, the City has reinvented itself as nearly a vibrant city. Trendy shops and lively pedestrian activity are the core of its vibrancy. Being seconds away from the pier and Palisades Park still keeps its spirit as Santa Monica by the Sea. Still, it’s a fun place to shop, walk, eat, drink, and recreate.",Cavydad
20,Just an outdoor mall,Chain stores. Lots of people. Really just a city street blocked off for an outdoor mall of national chains you get in any city.,Mikelemberg

40,A great walk,"This is an iconic area. At one time it had a little local flavor but now it is just an open air mall. It is a nice one though, and it does offer some people watching. If you go in the streets perpendicular to 3rd you can still find some of the non chain stores.",VNORVI

40,Three pedestrian blocks of shops/restaurants,"Third street promenade is one of the few pedestrian streets in the LA area. It’s filled with street performers, shops, restaurants, and movie theaters, but it’s only three blocks long. It’s worth combining a walk down the promenade with a stroll along the pier.",loveDCA

Whether it was for breakfast, afternoon coffee, shopping or and evening dinner, we were there at least once a day. There are so many shops to choose from and the variety of restaurants is excellent.

Plenty of eateries, juice shops and espresso bars to fill you up. The odd busker and a sprinking of homeless add to the atmosphere.Plenty if Xmas idea's in one compact area.Recommend.",Michael M
30,Not that special!,"We walked the promenade after dinner a few weeks before Christmas. The decorations and lights were nice. Other than that, it's the same old stores.

40,Lovely shopping strip,"Over the years 3rd street has just got better and better. With high end shops, relaxed and safe feel, this area is one of the better LA shopping strips. Very clean, little bit of art and American architecture.I particularly like the American sports bars and eating options in the area.",griffon_remy
50,Superb causal stroll,"Had a laid back feel to the place with medium to high end range stores.Best since it has a pedestrian walk compared to Abbot Kinney stretch, which are along streets and more unique but higher priced shops.",Benny
50,The best outdoor mall,This is by far the best outdoor mall that I’ve been to. Something for every budget and it’s even possible to sit and people watch if you’re not spending. A great way to spend the evening and just a few blocks from the Santa Monica pier! I’m not a big shopper but this was pure heaven!,damckin_99
40,"crowded, but festive","It is crowded, full of tourist traps in terms of food, but also nice shops and street vendors, which add a festive touch. A lot of benches and seating areas (in the sun/in the shade), so it is good for people watching.

40,Great dining and shopping area in Santa Monica,"Parking at this area is expensive. If you go on a week day park at the pier which is only $7 whole day if you will visit both the pier and the Promenade. There are lots of good restaurants and this area on the Third is closed to traffic. Shops mostly closed at 9 pm, so in the winter time where sun sets before 5 pm after watching the sunset at the pier you have plenty of time for shopping and dining at the Promenade!",Canucks301
40,Nice walk,"It is a street where you will enjoy a nice walk. You can find plenty of people singing in the street, or any other type of artists. Also, there are a lot of shops and it's near the beach.",Nicoleta J
50,Most European part of the West Coast?,"First, Third Street Promenade is just a stretch of road with shops and most of the shops are not that exceptional. However, it is pedestrians-only which is largely unheard of in the USA; it has great people watching, great musicians and performers, good restaurants, and -yes- shops. And it connects to a beautiful open-air mall, Santa Monica Place. My favorites are a particularly good Barnes and Nobles, Puzzle Zoo (a game and toy store), and the REI (on 4th St).",dirkj0t
40,Great shops and food spots,"This was a cute little find, dotted with loads of shops and food spots galore. Nice to be able to stroll down (and back and forth) without having to worry about cars.

50,Very nice shopping/dining area,Area was really cool and a pleasant surprise. Few blocks of no cars with quarantined dining and shopping. Excellent area. Very nice food options. Solid retail options. Good street performers. Felt safe at all times. Visited multiple times during our stay.

40,Shopping,I remember coming here as a child to wonderful street performers and a bustling promenade. Things have changed greatly. Many stores with few performers. Restaurants mingled among the stores. Unless you are there for shopping or dinner it wasn't an evening out. May go back tomorrow for that specially. We did stop and get dessert at Carlos Bakery that just opened and the cannoli was fantastic!,amber1127
40,Crowded but fun!,"I live several blocks from the Promenade, and go there regularly.Great for people watching w/ lots of street performers. A variety of restaurants, from casual to nice sit-downs. PLENTY of places to have a drink. Movie theaters as well.No cars or bicycles allowed, so safe for kids, who do have fun running around.A word of caution for tourists: you cannot smoke on the Promenade, or anywhere in Santa Monica within 20 feet of a door or window. No smoking in outdoor restaurants, either. You can get a hefty fine from police patrolling on bicycles.",karenmartha
50,If You're Looking For An All Around Experience or Family/Date Night,"3rd Street Promenade has VARIETY. There are numerous stores, restaurants, vendors, and lots of foot traffic. Everything from live music to yoga class to salsa dancing. Depending on the season, you will see different street performers doing/singing different tunes.The most festive times to come here are during the end of the year (holidays) or the summer (beach crowd).Traveler Tip: There are a lot of people here so just if you are looking to avoid the crowds, I'd head elsewhere. I prefer a more relaxing environment on the day to day, but when I go out with friends or for a date I like lively music and energy. For those nights, Third Street is a great place to be.Overview: I'd recommend this place to a friend for shopping, food, a date, or family night.I'm a fellow traveler so I appreciate when other people have given me tips/recommendations while in a new city.

The Promenade itself has a nice mixture of shops, from the higher-end to the more affordable. If I need something, I can almost always find it somewhere along the Promenade.It's also a very beautiful and relaxing street to walk along. You feel very safe since it's pedestrian only. Also, there's always street performers and very talented musicians performing throughout the Promenade, giving a very relaxing and chill vibe.I love the Third Street Promenade for both the experience and the shopping options!

But the outdoor Promenade has something for everyone, and the people-watching is always great.Just a short walk from Santa Monica Pier's attractions and the beautiful municipal beach, this area is also now accessible via the new light rail system, with the Metro's Expo line terminating just a stone's throw from Third Street Promenade.",Cheryl M

I always enjoy the people watching too especially the tourists. Nice for a walk on a pleasant weather day. As others say, a change from indoor malls which aren't doing so well lately either.

40,Vacation,Third Street Promenade has many local restaurants which we tried a couple Stefano’s pizza which was very good. Shopping is plentiful but is the same stores you get at almost every shopping mall in the country not a lot of local as far as shopping goes. Street performances like singers and dancers were fun. I was surprised you didn’t see street artists though.,keithpowell0429

There is everything from high end designer brands to local to more affordable brands such as Old Navy, H&M, Uniqlo, etc.Seems kinda limited at first but as you walk around, there are a ton of shops to visit. There were restaurants too but didnt get to enjoy any due to time limitations.I recommend this place for shoppers definitely! You can also visit the Santa Monica Pier as it is walking distance from all the shopping :)",Satraveler318
40,Always fun,"Been here several times. Fun shopping experience, good restaurants too. Saturday evenings are always interesting with street performers and musicians - does get crowded though. So far, have always managed to get parking in the area, lots of parking lots.",KomalShahKapoor
30,Great shopping choices,A great way to shop without being stuck inside those giant monolithic westfield like centres. Easy to walk the shopping strip and a pleasant thing to do on a sunny day. There are a variety of food/drink options but a definite negative is a lack of free restrooms. Many restaurants have signs up saying restrooms are only for guests so this must be a well known problem.Very close to Santa Monica Pier and very easy to access a cab or Uber. I would rate this location higher if they improved the restroom availability.,Besal68
30,Noisy and no good food,Place is rather boring. It lacks good restaurants. Shopping seems to cater to teenagers. Too many noisy street entertainers playing over each other. Lots of homeless people. It lacks good bars or other entertainment. Maybe a good brewpub would help. On the plus side parking is ample and quick walk to beach.,Romeo909

40,Great shopping but a lot of homesless,"Walking down this street felt a lot safer than other parts of Santa Monica. I did not like Santa Monica in general as it felt dirty and unsafe. There were a lot of homeless and we saw a drug affected person nearly get hit by a bus, yet it seemed normal behaviour as people did not react when he did it. This street was clean and had a lot of people, mostly tourists. A lot of shops, all the big ones. There were some good street artists playing music and the food options were good also.",56Katrina_M11

It’s got everything you could want in terms of restaurants, clothing stores and entertainment but a mall is a mall is a mall and it is really not that different to others of it’s kind apart from the fact it’s in a great location not far from the Pier. There is a shopping centre, Santa Monica Place nearby as well which is worth a look. If you like malls, you will like Third Street Promenade a lot.

40,Fun scene,There is always something going on on the promenade - early morning to late at night. Plenty of different restaurants and bars and shopping. One thing that bothered us about Santa Monica was the number of homeless. Every where you looked you saw them and were even asked for money. We saw police giving parking tickets but ignoring the homeless. I felt bad. But basically the promenade is a great fun place to go.,CynK65

40,Great Stroll,"Created about the same time cities across the country were turning at least one downtown street into a pedestrian mall, this one has flourished while others have withered and died. There are many reasons for the success of the Promenade: Santa Monica's pleasant year round temperature, lack of rainfall, plentiful parking nearby and a demographic that attracts and holds major stores. The mall is attractively landscaped and makes an pleasant venue for street performers. Stores include a big Nordstrom's and a huge Apple store as well as most major clothing stores. Along the way there are smaller stores, attractive restaurants and some seasonal pop-ups. I live around the corner now, so the promenade is a great convenience, but even when I lived miles away, it was worth the drive to get to this 5-block long place to walk, shop, eat and watch people.",Cornelius T

If you need help keep your eyes open for the ambassadors, in orange with green ""i"" buttons. They have a ton of information and some discount coupon books. The south end of the walk seems to have more 'energy' than the north but you have to do the whole thing regardless.My only complaint? Singing buskers that need an iPhone to remember the words of a song. Gone are the days of true artists and work ethic it seems. Oh well, the music can still be good.",SenorGancho

It is never boring here. The energy is wonderful and you get to understand how a little breeze from ocean and good attitude can make your day. There is limited free parking in several City Lots and also validated parking. More than two hours would require paying. Still it is quite reasonable. Highly recommend to spend at least three hours. And just ENJOY.",YMRob
10,Want to be in an episode of the walking dead?,"Then go for a stroll here - or anywhere in SM really! Add some spice and make it late at night on your own.No offence to the homeless or the liberal attitudes and weather which make this a relatively pleasant place for them i guess, but really it is not pleasant to witness or can be classed as a tourist attraction.You can pay stop sign lottery on the corner of every block - will you get a pass and can WALK ? Or will you get the red hand of STOP - here the ""penalty"" will range from a gentile unnerving from the chattering madman behind you in he queue, to the aggressive verbal abuse from the deranged. These are probably both 10/1 shots to be fair. But it's only 2/1 that you are overcome with the stench of BO or urine from the well behaved.Try stopping for a rest or to eat on one of the many publicly provided seating areas - they either will not be available or you wont want to .. trust me. Best lace for this is actually the promenade along the sea front at dusk - bet you won't.There's a deeper review to be made here for sure - i wasn't comfortable here on many levels not least with the juxtapositon of the living dead with the high end malls. I'd recommend it to challenge yourself on the problems of the modern world but not as a tourist attraction",gamblermk2

50,Promenade a Shoppers Delight--A+,"Santa Monica's ""Third Street Promenade"" is definitely worth checking out. Parking can be tricky but definitely worth any hassle. It has lots of culture with great energy it creates a wonderful shopping experience. Plenty of unique boutiques and exclusive retailers to choose from. Live entertainment to enjoy and outside eateries make it chill yet very welcoming. The environment is relaxing and beautiful. My rating--A+",luckee77
40,Fun afternoon - especially if you love shopping,"A fun way to spend a few hours on a sunny afternoon. Loads of shopping, great restaurants, and a short walk to the beach. Definitely worth a check out, whether you just go for lunch - or spend all day cruising around.",Stephen S

40,"A place to walk, shop and eat but no soul","I knew this street when it was all the old original stores and it was cool, funky and authentic. I understand 'progress' but there is nothing authentic anymore about this place, other than it's one of the ONLY pedestrian spaces in LA other than the Grove (ugh) which is another debacle called 'progress'. The Promenade is a safe place to stroll, do shopping, grab a bite and see a movie but....you can do that at almost any outside mall now. Thank god for the farmers market, which is one of the reasons I still hit the Promenade.",Aricot
40,Great selection of stores,"Spent the day in Santa Monica and had to walk and shop the Promenade. There is a nice selection of stores, both chain and boutique. You also have a variety of food options and large department stores. In addition, as in many beach cities, there is an eclectic blend of eateries. This is a great place to idle away spare time, get some exercise in, show off California to visitors, get you shop on or indulge in some interesting food and drink.",SrGrammyLinda

30,Promenade Review,The Promenade used to be really a great place to spend an evening. Its regressed in the last few years.The stores still offer plenty of variety and there isnt a lack of street performers but it just seemed better before.Food places are plentiful and the real entertainment starts at dark.Parking is over at the mall on the far end of the Promenade but is a nightmare to obtain. It makes coming here a little daunting.,Jonathan W
50,Attractive upscale mall with high end retailers,"Hugo Boss, and many others it is a very pretty and modern promenade. You can also find an Old Navy if you want some savings. There are many exclusive boutiques and kiosks.",Mark E

40,Shopping and entertainment street,"Santa Monica is like an upscale and focused version of LA, and these shops and restaurants reflect that.Was round this a couple of times, once in daytime when it was starting to get busy and then at night when it was very busy. Preferred the night as more atmosphere.It's a lot of upscale shops mixed with more well known brands all in the same place, with a myriad of restaurants and bars mixed in.It's classy enough and you'll find what you need if you know what your looking for!",andhewittscores
40,A nice spot to shop and eat,"We enjoyed walking around this promenade without having to contend with traffic. It's easy to get around and walk from one side to another, see the shops and eat. There's even a movie theatre on this street.Parking nearby in a garage was easy and reasonable.Would return.",FloridawithKids

50,Fabulous to shop & listen side street concert,"When ever my family in Southern Family, we would go there to shop, dine and just plain people watching. From high end brands store to middle. So the choices are there and shopping in open space is just add into the true of Southern California. I used to love the Grove, but this is bigger and that side walk shows are just fun to watch. Sometime you'd get to hear old timer jazz singer and that would be a treat. Prepare to shop or meals and listen or watch at the same place. Indeed fun place to go for family outing!",Dharmadji5
40,I'm glad they made it a promenade...,"No cars! In LA?? You bet! They've done a great job putting the 3rd ST Promenade together. Plenty of shops - a lot of the usual ones, some decent and interesting places to eat and drink. Plenty (I mean PLENTY) of parking. And cheap. Makes it easy to visit.Give it a whirl and you might find you like it.",joe a
40,Wee and weed,"3rd Street Promenade is a great laid back shopping Street, with multiple retailers as well as boutique shops, Cafes, restaurants, street performers. A real Californian feel. Easy parking nearby. There is a subtle Wiff in the air of urine (street dwellers use the benches to sleep on and the trees to wee on, as you do!). As the Street gets busier with shoppers the smell of marijuana gets stronger, a sign of the loosening Californian laws on marijuana use. There must be a lot of unwell people in Santa Monica that require the medical use of the weed!",Ian H
50,Great walking and shopping,"This is one of my favorite places to stroll in Santa Monica. California has excellent outdoor malls and shopping streets, and 3rd Street Promenade is one of the best. There are fun sculptures, great cafes and shops, fountains, and you will find plenty of space even when there are lots of people around.",Daryl J
40,Full of life,"I've loved visiting third street promenade everytime I've visited California. So full of life and street musicians, performance artists, shops, bars, and. restaurants. It's changed a lot since the first time I visited in the 90s. Full of people and parking and traffic is definitely an issue but still worth a visit if you can.",mzzshawny

40,Calm Main Shopping Street,It has many more shops than you realise including an Apple Store. It also has a small shopping mall at the end of it and many coffee shops and restaurants to enjoy. It's a pedestrian zone so you can see one or two buskers also. Fun relaxed shopping area.,PFTraveller62
40,Great shopping experience,I visited Third Street promenade with my wife and 12 year old daughter who was keen to buy some new clothes and enjoy a US shopping experience. She wasn't disappointed. There's a great range of shops on Third Street and my daughter found everything she wanted. There's also a great range of restaurants and snack bars. We stopped off for a slice of pizza for lunch and the whole experience was a delight. Thoroughly recommended for idling away an afternoon.,waddo100
50,"Spend 2 Hours, or a Relaxing Evening","The Third St. Promenade is quite the cosmopolitan place. A cool outdoor pedestrian walk that captures the LA vibe. There are benches & seats which enticed me to linger along the way & people-watch while I indulged in a smorgasbord of treats such as Crepes 😋.I watched street performers who were really talented. The colossal dinosaur-shaped shrubs were amazing.The festive lighting @ night really brought the Promenade to life. Many families were strolling, shopping, eating. There are evening events in a variety of musical genres. There is no reason to be bored if you're in the mood for Free Fun! It was a relaxing experience to cap off my day.",ChanEvan
40,Worth it if you are in the area,We parked there to go to the beach. Was fun to walk by but I wouldn't recommend to drive there just to see the promenade.,Phil F
50,The place to be,"We were in Santa Monica for several days and this was a nightly go to spot. Packed with restaurant, shops and people the are made for some great people watching. It had to be very popular with wealthy folks too as we saw several exotic sports cars including a few with tags from middle eastern countries. Now that was amazing. If you like hanging with the tourist crowd this is the place for you.",David C

40,Very nice evening walk,Offers variaty of inexpensive to mid priced local food options rather than usual fast food choices. There are varied light shopping options. Didn't see the usual chain stores. But there was good size Apple tech store. The street was well lite in the evening. The area had a good number of other people so your not alone on unfamiliar street.,MIke23693
30,Nice on Sunday,"Just a pleasant place to stroll. It's a couple of blocks away from Ocean Ave which parallels the most magnificent view of the Pacific Ocean. At the far end of the 3rd Street Promenade us a ""mall"" with your typical stores plus high end shops too like Louis Vuitton. At the top of the mall is a great place for lunch from the typical shopping center fast food places... but the views are spectacular!On 3rd St Promenade on the weekends there are street musicians and dancers. The st is blocked off for pedestriansEnjoy!",judysinger
50,The place to be!! - A Must Visit,The whole street has a festive vibe with numerous cafes & outdoor seating. There are several musicians & street performers out there. It has a lot of visitors out to have a good time. The place immediately make you in a good mood.Highly recommended,Gailani Art

20,Yogi Berra was right,"Out-of-town tourists may find the Promenade fascinating, but locals won't go there. It's crowded, noisy, and the stores are unremarkable. Or, as Yogi Berra, said, ""Nobody goes there anymore. It's too crowded.""",Peter A

50,Visit to the Promenade,"The Third Street Promenade is filled with activity, one of a kind shops and boutiques and restaurants. You can spend an entire day here and not see it all. It is also within walking distance to the Santa Monica Pier and because of the Purple rail line it is very accessible. I parked in one of the many parking structures which are less than a block away from the Promenade. Fun place to visit.",Marie T
50,Get An Eye Full,"This has to be one of the best outdoor malls in America for several reasons. The stores are top brands with great inventory. My favorite store is Adidas they have the newest releases and a great staff. Eats are all over the place so you will not be disappointed. Entertainment is outdoors with talented people taking donations all day and night. People watching is fantastic and you may see someone interesting. The best tip is park in one of the many city parking structures and the first 90 minutes is FREE and reasonable if you stay longer. Use google maps and enter parking for locations. Extremely crowded on weekends. Go, it's great and have some fun even if you not a shopper.",David S
50,Great strolling and shopping,"You might not automatically know that this shopping attraction exists when heading to the Santa Monica Pier or beach. This multi-block, converted street is a delightful place to stroll, shop for mid ranged goods, and enjoy bars and restaurants. Don't forget to add this area to your itinerary. It is a very short walk to the beach as well.",Steve S
40,"Beautiful Area, Great Shopping, But Not a Must See","The Third Street Promenade is a 3 or 4 block area that you walk though. It is like a huge outdoor mall. There are movie houses, places to eat, chain stores, and a few unique stores.The area is lovely, you can walk right to the beach from the Promenade. Some of the eateries are super good, nothing out of this world, but very good. You can fine cheap eats and some pretty nice places to eat if you want.There are street entertainers and that is always fun, there are a few very cool shops for clothes you might not find elsewhere, but for the most part it is upscale chain stores.It is usually not too hot in Santa Monica.Parking is a bear, so if you try the streets, mind the signs, there are parking structures that are a fair price, use one of those.While you are there go to Ye Ol' Kings Head for fish and chips lunch, yum.It appears ever so safe and looks can be deceiving. Your wallet is always in your front pocket, don't leave you packages just sitting around and at night stay right around there.Have fun.",elizabethlascheid
40,Great place for early morning coffed and cake,"Was recommended we visit this location when we were staying in Santa Monica, As it was just around the corner from our hotel on 2nd Street it was an easy stroll.We arrived about 10am and the street and shops were just waking up. The promenade covers 3 blocks from Wilshire and Broadway. We had a very pleasant hour's rest taking in the views and activity enjoying coffee and cake/cookies at Sloan's.Whilst we were sitting here we saw an site of a Phalanx of LAPD cycle past in a squad of about 20 bikes.This is a good place to stroll around and relax.",Martin G
50,Lovely atmosphere!,"I really enjoyed the hustle bustle and activity here. There is lots of shopping here, ranging from big brands, to little boutiques and my favorite the roadside carts. Great place to buy souvenirs and trinkets. There are street performers and benches to sit and enjoy a coffee or an ice cream. The ambiance was just awesome! We were heading to the beach after this, and I had come a little unprepared. Stopped at GAP and a few swim wear shops and we were good to go!I would have liked to spend longer here... but the kids were just too keen to get to the beach!",AbbyUmer

40,Pleasant pedestrianised shopping and dining,"Runs for a few blocks to a big mall at one end, all the usual shops and eateries. Good atmosphere and clearly a Friday night destination. Unfortunately as with everywhere else in Santa Monica LOTs and Lots of vagrancy and begging, most of the public seating seemed to be owned either by a (very good) street musician or a hobo",Williamsfam
40,Great shopping,"Recommend this area for great shopping, and just taking in the atmosphere, lots of street performers to enjoy. Three cinemas close by. I ate great food just off Third Street, on Arizona Ave; Tender Greens and Burger Lounge.",Terry G
40,A bit for everyone,A shopping strip is a shopping strip but being located in Santa Monica makes this strip a virtual pleasure to stroll along. There are a wide range of shops and there is something for everyone. We needed to but gifts for family and fiends and we found everything we needed at the Third Street Promenade.,Nebuliza
40,What a gorgeous area!,"We stumbled on this gem by accident when we booked dinner at PF Chang' just around the corner from here. It's beautiful! No cars allowed on the street so you can walk with ease to go shopping, eating or watching free entertainment. There's many artists performing and they're very good. Some were bands, some were solo artists, but the music was fantastic. There's someone performing at every block it seems.",Fretheriki

30,"Walkable, but reminded me of a standard shopping mall","Yes, this is a great place to stroll while in downtown Santa Monica, but much of it is standard mall stores. Think Barnes & Noble, Sketchers, Apple Store and other chain stores. Most of the stores are upscale. The layout is far enough away from the harbor and sheltered by buildings, so it doesn't get the cool ocean breezes. It was very hot to walk around on a late July afternoon. The fountains are a nice touch. Parking, when available is expensive. There are many restaurants with outdoor seating, but again some are national chains. If you like mall shopping and the comfort of shopping in retail chain stores, this is the place for you",Green1Ma

40,The brand catwalk,I went to the Apple Store at Third Street Promenade. Many brands are located on this strip. Cars are not allowed. It is a shopping street.,Viajanos
30,Expecting a little more,"The area was well planned, but I was hoping there would be a little more to offer in terms of variety of stores. I liked the fact there was no motor traffic through the area. The store choices were not as interesting as I was hoping for. A balance of food and shops, but just check out the offering of stores before you plan your time. I suggested my mother-in-law see a movie while the rest of us shopped, then regretted it as the stores and surrounding area didn't hold my attention for the two hours she was in the theater. Good place to sit and watch people. If more unique shopping was offered it would have been a hit.",scottcmorrison

50,Yep. Place to be.,Been here a few times over the last six weeks when we have been in & out of Santa Monica and the broader LA area. I love it here. Such a cosmopolitan place. There is a huge range of culture here. Spent a number of hours doing coffee & bagels whilst watching the parade of the local community. There are some truly awesome buskers performing at various places. The number of times I heard people say the buskers should be on TV would be in triple figures. Great range of food options. Great range of shops. There are smoked salmon bagels which are to die for.,Gerry K
40,Good shops and restaurants,There are some great shopping opportunities and restaurants around here. Some celebrities come here apparently but we didn't see any,Byrne A
40,A walk on the street.,"So my friend said go to this place at night you'll LOVE it. We went. But during the day. It's very pretty, but it was mediocre as far as entertainment goes. Bear in mind, I went to see the sights and do a bit of window shopping, but barely took notice of any stores.There is a super Tesla storefront that treats every human being that walks in from baby to senior as if they already purchased and are about to purchase their next Tesla. No exclusivity, and I loved it. However sadly, tesla doesn't make pickup trucks yet.There was a young Asian man playing contemporary music on a viola, and I stood spellbound for at least five minutes. Otherwise, the promenade was just a long street with alot of people walking around. Maybe we caught it at the wrong hour. I don't know. But I certainly wont think of it as the highly of my trip.If I return one time at night, I'll report back to let you know what I think. But for now, they only get four.",SamKHealy
50,Fun Shops!,"This is a really nice shopping hub not far from Santa Monica pier. It is a very clean and inviting part of town, considering how many homeless there are on the streets and beaches of this town.

There are also pretty statues and signs and, if you ate lucky, some talented street musicians.",Heather S
30,Teenager Enjoyed It,"The teenager in our family really enjoyed us. The rest of us had a pleasant stroll throughout the largely traffic-free area. There are street performers in various areas and many non-chain restaurants and eateries where hungry shoppers can find something great to try.

In addition to third street, there is also a big shopping mall at one end. There were a number of street entertainers in this vibrant and lively part of Santa Monica.

Of course we stopped in on Nordstrom's, Brandy Melville, and had lunch at Lemonade. Some street performers entertain shoppers and walkers. A couple of blocks away is the beach itself. This is a nice outdoor mall and preferable to any indoor mall.",MGN777

The beach is just a couple blocks away. Parking in this area is not the easiest thing, but there are a number of garages. If you park in one of the garages, the first 90 minutes is free.",Alan S

40,"Nice place, no stars sighted... 😢","So, I was hoping this would be the place where I finally got to meet my future second-wife, Selena Gomez. My family was told that this is a good spot to catch a glimpse of the occasional actor and/or actress/famous person. We saw no one of import. Not even like a step-Baldwin was to be seen. So my hopes of finally connecting with the hottest woman on the planet (even though I'm old enough to be her... uh... much older brother...), Ms Selena Gomez, we're dashed aside like, much like the career of Dom Deluise's son after The Wizards of Waverly Place...However, there was a really cool candy shop here and my family really enjoyed our time walking around this area. I wish we had had more time to check out the ""farmer's market"", 'cause it looked like there were lots of cool treats to be found there ☺",AdventurerRich
20,"Nothing important for a visit, especially with kids, just high end shops","This is not a must see by any stretch, if you are looking for things to do in Santa Monica. If you are a couple, this would be a nice stroll after the beach, to kill some time. We came across this by accident on our way to the beach. I thought, so this is it? We spent a few minutes there. A nice singer was entertaining a crowd. There was a fountain guarded by bushes cut into dinosaur shapes. Nice shops and place to go if you live in the area. If you are tourist, go bike the path and visit the shops along the beach.",Jacquelyn F
50,"Great atmosphere, good food and shopping.",It's really worth a stroll down Third Street Promenade during the day and in the evening. There are some nice shops to browse through and a good choice of bars and restaurants too. The area is festooned with fairy lights at night so looks really pretty. There are always several really talented musicians busking and groups of people stopping to listen to them. Only downside is the number of down-and-outs who gather here later in the evening .... although not intimidating it does make you uncomfortable. That said we would certainly amble up and down Third Avenue every time we go to Santa Monica.,MikeandWendy01

The vibe is busy, fun, vibrant, multicultural, and casual. Parking is plentiful and right off the promenade in public garages.The best thing to do is arrive around three, putter in the boutiques, check out the restaurants on the way DOWN, then eat an early dinner with something you can take out in your hand and get really messy with. Jeans..shorts...wet wipes. It's like a carnival, only entrance is free and the events change every day/ week! In the evenings there are musicians and solo artists...also free...and a sense of belonging to something greater than yourself...and by that, I mean the remarkable metropolis of Greater L.A.

30,Kind of bland and tired,"Although it's great for a leisurely stroll and people watching, the shopping here is pure American mall oriented with virtually no local flavor or variety from what you can find at any other retail area across the nation.

But, for me, personally, the Memorial Day weekend 2017, will be unforgettable, not along for the shops, and eateries, but for the amazing talent that one had come into contact with on both sides of the Promenade. If country music is one's thing, you found it there . . . if jazz, blues, opera, or neo-soul, and even a little spoken-words were there, too.As a short-film documentarian, I was able to capture little segments to feature on a local cable show.The safety . . . the clean streets . . . the diversity among both tourist and locals were amazing.",davidbE6543HD

30,Strange shopping area...,"This place is definitely a tale of two separate commerce areas - on one side, storefronts for the budget-mid range shoppers, and on the other side, storefronts/piazzas for the well-heeled. There really isn't anything ""charming"" about the area - doesn't quite match the ambience of Faneuil Hall in Boston.There were quite a few families with 'tweens milling about. Great selection of stores for them. There were plenty of tourist-y vendor carts as well.While searching for a restroom, I ended up in what appeared to a ghost town filled with high-end shops. It was a rather dark (from the shadows of the bldgs) and eerily quiet area. I had to ask 3 or 4 people to direct me to the restroom area - signage was confusing at best. I ended up going up & down the escalator at least a couple of times before I found someone who could give me explicit directions to a rest area.I noticed the shops in the upper crust section were virtually empty - no shoppers to be seen. There were a few skateboarders hanging around the seating area in the middle of the plaza. That was it.There are quite a few restaurants in the area, both in the promenade and on the side streets going toward the ocean. You can also walk down to the Pier from here - about a 3 block walk.We had lunch at an Italian Bistro on the corner of 3rd St and Broadway (?). It was very good. Service was excellent for tourist area.Perhaps this place is better at night - there are strings of lights hanging over the streets.If I go back, I will definitely go back at night.",KuriousKat2
20,Not a must visit if you have limited time,"Time may be better spent elsewhere if you have limited hours in LA and wondering where to go nearby after visiting Santa Monica Pier.Only stuff that may appeal to a budget tourist is the street entertainment and the affordable pizza and burgers joints. and not the chain shopsYou get singers, wannabe David Copperfield/krisangel , mime and the occasional belly dancer (do leave a tip if you r watching to any of these if you are watching and been entertained)Not a 'must go to next' advice for foreign tourists unless you r a shopper for expensive goods geared at those with deeper pockets",Highadventurer
50,Unexpected surprise!!,"With all of our careful planning for our trip to Santa Monica/LA, we somehow missed the existence of the Third Street Promenade.

10,Tourists and transients,"Disappointed in the experience of the third street promenade. It is very crowded and it appears that everyone is a tourist, no locals around either. Oddly the taxes are higher here than just a few short miles east in Westwood or south in Westchester. There are some very talented musicians that perform on the promenade but hardly worth the visit.More disturbing is the obviously mentally disturbed individuals that panhandle in the area.

40,Cruising and people watching,"Parking has vastly improved and the toilet situation has become a little less daunting with restaurants opening their doors more for casual walk ins.... this has n't always been the case. There always are many homeless on the side streets.. but they don't bother or harass.... and certainly don't panhandle on the promenade itself.The entertainment is still going strong and i was surprised how busy it was between 11am and 2pm. There are many parking structures and valet spots along the back alleys running parallel to the promenade... but be patient and circle around to see what best fits yr need. it can be $20 to first 2hrs free... plenty to choose from just keep those tickets folks.behind the Broadway end of the promenade the area has had a serious makeover ,modernity has brought the metro line service to Santa monica.... wonderful pedestrian areas and excellent eateries now flourish in this area.Btw - there are surveillance cameras everywhere along the promenade and alleyways... perhaps why the homeless are so well behaved and the place being so busy. Sure pick pockets are working overtime... but the days of purse snatching and back alley loitering are rare I would imagine.The Santa Monica Police cruise by often and contrary to what some have said... there is zero gang element on the promenade these days.Over a period of 3 weeks we visited about 6 times, day and early evening and had a great time people watching, eatingand enjoying the beautiful warm weather !",kiwilelei

Beside ""tragically"" being over crowded by cars from all over you still can breath the Pacific Ocean clean and crisp air day and night, walking on the beach is a good walk where you can walk 26 mile or just cross the pacific cost highway (PCH) to the famously known Santa Monica pier, at night the place can become the Pacific Ocean light, look for the lights of pier lighting up the ocean front. The restaurants are not recommended by one but depending on your appetite and your choice of food, this place is the Mecca of restaurants with good foods and friendly people.",bkphotography48

30,Typical shopping street not tremendously impressed,We were excited to check this out because it seemed like it could be a lot of fun but there was not really anything that special in terms of the retail environment or the environment in general.Of course we were with a teenager and that meant to stop at the Abercrombie and Fitch store which did result in a few purchases but other than that it didn't seem like anything I would do again and probably could've spent a few more hours doing something more culturally interesting.I suppose if you live somewhere where there are no fun walking malls with retail shops it might be a good diversion for a couple of hours.,bookpublisher

My wife had been here many years ago when she had visited and thought it was a cool area. The Promenade was nice , decorated for the holidays. Many of the stores were just chains. We walked around for a bit, in and out of stores. There were some holiday events going on. The area was nice, as was Santa Monica as a whole, though similar to other Promenades I've seen before, but probably with more chains. I didn't feel like it was a real unique place.

It is a thriving beach community, in what is a rapidly recovering major city (LA). We have stayed in Santa Monica many times, The Promende offeres an enticing mixture of high end stores and a wide range of restaurants, one of which, called Pure Food, was so good we ate there four times in one week! The street performers consist of musicians, with small bands inviting people to dance in the street, which is blocked off from automobile traffic.Lots of fun things to do, including a Tesla and Apple Store. Only downside, it's very popular, with hordes of people now taking the Light Rail from downtown LA, making Santa Monica their destination. So, plan your dinner activities accordingly, with reservations.",Jonathan575

50,Great For a Stroll With People Watching,"We visited Santa Monica 10 years ago, but were eager to return to the Third Street Promenade. We had planned to have lunch at True Food Kitchen, but other than that, just walk the promenade and see the sights. There are several parking garages nearby. We parked at the Parking Structure 2 and had no problems getting a spot even though it was lunch time. You can just search the address on your iPhone. There was also Parking Structure #6, but there was road construction so we ended up in #2. I think it ended up costing about $15 for the day. We just left our car there after walking the Promenade and went to see the pier, followed by a walk along the beach path to Venice. By then we were tired and got an Uber who brought us back to our car at the parking garage!The Promenade has many fun shops and restaurants so do your research in advance or just walk and explore.

50,Great people watching and more!!!,"Our lovely little promenade area is fabulous for people watching (I live in the area and visit the area regularly). There are also a variety of restaurants and ice cream shops, as well as some great shopping and amusing street entertainment. Evenings have been especially crowded with lots of people, some on vacation and some just getting away from the city heat. There are also four movie theaters in the area (2 in the promenade, one in the mall at the south end of the promenade, and our independent theater one block west on 2nd Street). The restaurants and some of the shopping extend both one block west and one block east (from 2nd Street, through the promenade and on 4th Street, and the related side streets).Parking in the city garages on 2nd and 4th streets is free for the first 90 minutes.Bathrooms are a challenge, though, so it is helpful to use the ones in the departments stores in the mall (south end), or in the movie theaters or restaurants, if you partake in any of those.

There are plenty of stores to browse here much like an outdoor mall with restaurants and snack eateries intermixed. The trees have vintage style lights hanging from them which is probably the best feature. We were like fireflies attracted to walk the entire area because the mood is just happy. We brought our teacup Yorkie here and he had just as much fun meeting new dogs which are very welcome here.

I've been going to 3rd street promenade since it was first opened (yeah, I'm that old). I'd like to make a suggestion to the merchant association, and city council - How about planting some broad leaf trees? On a hot day there is zero shade. Second, can you please make it mandatory that street buskers attend a talent audition before being allowed to set up shop. We were eatiing outside at Barneys and there was a guy with an amplifier chanting some endless mumbo jumbo for our entire meal. I know we're supposed to be all ' wow, that's a cool street scene with great undiscovered talent', only it's not. It's just annoying.",FABourdain

10,AVOID!!,"I used to live in Santa Monica and this was the place to go shop! But on my recent return to this area I was so very disappointed!

50,Of course,"There is no reason not to go to the Promenade. The locals do. From out of town? Take a walk down the promenade, and ""promenade"". Listen to the great live music (constantly changing), drop into the Apple store (big), and play with the gadgets you can't afford. Try on some torn jeans (I'll never understand that). Have some Italian, Greek, Japanese, American, very healthy, very unhealthy food.... of your choice. Spot an actor you know trying not to be recognized (maybe just a little). Then walk down to the beach and collapse on the sunny sand. Santa Monica!",ROG13

40,A Huge Outdoor Mall,"If you find yourself needing to ""shop until you drop"" then by all means visit the Third Street Promenade. It is really a glorified High Street without the cars. You'll find all the name brand stores hocking their wares and everything seems to be on sale.The best part of it all are the street performers who make the occasion almost like a street party. You will find loads of food and drink options close by and with no cars to contend with you can just wander across the street without hesitation.",BreezeRidge3
50,Fun place with great shops,This outdoor shopping street is a nice place to eat and shop. Lots of little eateries and on the night we went there were different street musicians. The setting is very hip and clean! If not to shop at least go for a stroll of you're in the area.,lauleas808

50,Great shopping/eating choices,"I was visiting my niece in Santa Monica, CA and walked through the Third Street Promenade several times. It's a MUST SEE in my opinion. There were lots of shops and lots of restaurants/food places. A big plus was all the free entertainment by talented people. The weather was wonderful in June while I was there with a wonderful ocean breeze. Santa Monica beach and pier were just a few blocks away and was an easy walk. I have such fond memories of the beach because I grew up in Southern CA and went to the beach often. I'm 63 now and really enjoyed the Promenade area on this visit. I will return next time I'm in the area.",Jacki C

30,"Upbeat, Diverse and Colorful","I've visited the Third Street Promenade several times over the past few years and found it to be pretty much unchanged as of my last visit a couple of weeks ago. It's just a few blocks east of the Santa Monica Pier starting with a two level mall at the north end that flows out onto street level as you head south into the heart of the Promenade. As you venture south you'll instantly notice the change from mainstream stores to boutiques and specialty shops as well as a spattering of outdoor cafe's and even movie theatre's. Some of the shops are very hipsterish, but there's also a nice Nike store, toy store, card shop, sand and surf clothing, art boutiques as well as live entertainment that work for tips. In my opinion the Promenade is age appropriate for all and although at times a bit crowded, there's always room to move at forward at a leisurely pace. I wouldn't categorize it as an ""amazing"" experience but if you're looking for something between exciting or sitting by the pool, 3rd St. is a nice alternative. I've yet to encounter a problem finding parking as there are lots everywhere as well as valet parking depending on what street you travel to get there. You just have to keep your eyes open. I've always depended on Google maps to give me whatever information I need to find everything from the shops, restaurants and directions to the closest available parking areas. If you're planning to spend the day in Santa Monica as a tourist I highly recommend setting aside at least a couple of hours to have a look-see. The breeze from the ocean keeps the temperature moderate on most days but a hat and sunscreen wouldn't hurt to have along and, as I said before, you're walking distance to the beach and the Santa Monica Pier. You might also want to rent some bicycles as cruise along the boardwalk at the edge of the beach. The rental shops for bikes are ample and fairly priced. All in all, The Third Street Promenade has yet to disappoint and is true Southern California.",Joe S
50,Very nice,Very nice selection of shopping and dinning options. The area was very clean and there was security on patrol.,Elizabeth A
30,Unique shopping experience,"There are tons of places to shop and eat here. You will also be entertained by a wide variety of street performers! It is easy to spend an entire day exploring the area but I was a bit surprised that there was not a lot of ""local"" stores. When traveling, I like to shop local but there was very little opportunity for that here. We did enjoy Barnes & Noble, Urban Outfitters, Forever 21, Abercrombie and Fitch, Sephora, and Apple, but we can find those stores in most larger cities. Overall though, I would recommend stopping by if you are in the area.",Gvllgirl
40,Good shopping,"Lovely promenade. Great shops. Varied was good. Would visit again. Bought great clothes for both males and females, shoes and watches.",donnam25
30,Good if you need a quick restaurant or shop,"I used to visit third Street promenade when I lived here 20 years ago... From what I remember it was a classy, nice area for shopping and tons of great restaurants... It still has lots of shops and restaurants however it's seems more commercialized and less like I remembered. It's ok but if you are visiting from out of town and want some good sites stick with the pier, the beach and bike trail, go hike and for restaurants.. Other than a few in the area... Check out your reviews and go elsewhere.... If you want a mall type place that outside than you are good here... Loved Barneys Beanery though and had to stop at lush while we were here for some bath bombs.... It is what it is....",Ctinac777

It was so nice to be outside and the atmosphere was great. Everything was so lively here. Some people here of course were not so nice, we were standing off to the side to get something out of a bag and a girl smacked the sunglasses off my boyfriend's head and they hit the ground. It was shocking. A guy walking towards us said ""I totally saw that"". It was just crazy that someone would do that.. And it was quite cool at night so bring a sweater.",cloudpunch

50,Good place for a Sunday stroll,"3rd street promenade is really popular (and somehow crowded) on Saturday and Sunday in the late afternoon. People just come here for a stroll. It's actually a very nice one: you can find some of the most popular brands and you can enjoy some street art!If you come here in the morning, it's really peaceful. So I'd suggest to visit it in the late afternoon on weekends.",Francyfre
30,Just okay if not a shopper,"We liked the way that the area was set up and the street performers, but that was it. My husband and 18 year old son weren't into this at all. If you're a shopper and not too worried about budget, then this is for you.",Cld1966
40,Entertaining,Fun atmosphere although sometimes overwhelming. Lots of activity and street performers but with enough stores and little cafes to get away for a rest. Also the beach is just a short walk away to take in the sunset and the ocean breeze.,CignoNero
50,Great shopping,Great place to go if you are after some designer brands. Had a lovely time browsing the stores. We went on a weekend and they also had a market lane right at the end of the promenade. Nice and clean throughout which made the experience so much easier to enjoy,LilyHarris
50,Shopping and people watching,"A great place to visit for shopping or just walking. there were many sales going on! The street artist were busy at work, some were a little loud for my taste, but they were interesting. Many tourist present. It is expected especially during summer. People were generally pleasant and interesting.The parking is a nightmare. We took the bus on this particular day. I often walk from my home, about 2 miles, it is a pleasant walk on the beach or main street.There is a large variety of food for the hungry ones.",shotinthedark1956
50,"Fun, tons of people, places to shop and eat",A little bit of everything for everyone. Start with Barnes and Noble or CPK in the north. Saunter down see nice shoppes and food. End up at the mall for boutique shopping such as Burberry and BCBG. True food kitchen is delightful.,happyk8e
50,Love it ! 💕,"I love Third Street Promenade as its so lively with fabulous shopping with all the brand names & also smaller boutique shops all gathered together in one small pedestrian mall.One can spend hours here people watching , shopping or dining in one of the many trendy restaurants.

40,Fun Shopping Area California Style,"Adorable outdoor shopping area that has all the shops you could possible want up and down third street. There is a mix from high end designers to popular chain stores. Tory Burch, Burberry, Ted Baker, H&M, Abercrombie, Express, Brandy Melville even more. Plenty if restaurants scattered about. Big retail anchors are at one end. Nordstroms, Bloomingdales and Sears. It also has multiple movie theaters.",lizd3
30,The California version of Times Square,"I came here desperate for some things I had forgotten to bring with me, so I headed down 3rd Street to do some shopping. Almost every store you can think of is on this street which is of course nice and convenient. However, it was way too packed for me, so I did my necessity shopping and tried to get out of there as soon as possible. Also, if you're coming from another big city, you'll be disappointed in the Bloomingdale's, Nordstroms & H&M here because they are just way too small. The location is cool because you can head here after the beach, otherwise, do not go out of your way to come here unless you desperately need some items like I did.",Erika G
40,Nice place to walk through,"I have to admit I didn't feel it was a great location for shopping but I very much enjoyed walking up and down the promenade a number of times during my trip. There were a number of interesting buskers and artists of different kinds, none of which I felt were too pushy. There isn't the greatest selection of food I felt but the atmosphere did draw you into eating there anyway.",Marcimo_NZ
50,Vibrant fun shopping street,"The music on the street will make everyone happy here. Loved the street musicians. Last night was walking around this street during the evening, suddenly you hear this beautiful music starts, the dark blue sky, and night lights turned more romantic at once. The shops are fun to check out as well. Some good restaurants around here the shopping area! The end of the street is a very nice little square that you can check out high end stores. People watching here are also fun! Very cool street.",Kelly P

Lots of parking ( all pay lots of course), but just a short walk to the beach or Santa Monica pier.",TravelQueen90211
10,STAY AWAY!!! NO CAMERAS!!,"I'm writing this in hopes to save other people and families!!!! We traveled from Florida and love to stop at different towns to shop/eat!! This Promenade was great although do NOT park in the garages! We were literally sitting ducks! We got back to our rental car to realize it was broken into and NO ONE CARED!! I called the police 5 times! The parking garage supervisor 8 times... No one came, called, or cared!!After realizing an 1 hr plus passed!!! It was becoming dark soon and I thought best to leave to make my own report at the police station.. While attempting to leave the garage, after already paying for my time... They stated u owed a dollar... I went nuts, and then FINALLY THE MYSTERIOUS MIASUPERVISOR came out.. He knew who I was, & the incident... I said,""Sir,.. Why did you not come up to my level""... I called about 8 times.. He stated he was busy and that this happens often..... They are cameras only pulling in/out only!!!Nothing in betweenIf you are paying to park, you should feel somewhat secure!!!Nothing was left out!!!These Thieves hand selected our personal items... Clothes out of our suitcases!! Took my 3 kids school computers, phone chargers, head phones, purses!!! Even my Excederin!!Which means to me... This was an inside job! Too much time on there hands, nothing was smashed. They used a slim Jim of some sort..On way out... Speaking to this supervisor!!! Finally, he was not apologetic, he stated this happens a lot!!! Then I realized maybe he knew something??? & I stated to him that I would offer a reward.. Because I already shut down the computers and credit cards... What they took was Not going to worth much.... He took my number!!!!Seems fishyDon't park there",JenniferAP28

40,Good Outdoor Experience,I have always enjoyed my time at the Third Street Promenade. There's plenty of stores and restaurants to choose from. Live performances and lovely weather. Parking garage is near by which is helpful. You don't have to worry about cars at all. Plenty of places to sit if memory serves me correctly.One of the restaurants I would dine would be the Crepe place. It typically stays pretty packed after 5 p.m. but tasty nonetheless. It's right around the corner from Burke Williams Spa as well in case you walk to around before or after your massage.I would recommend enjoying the scenery if you're in the area for sure.,MsTia79
40,Nice walkway,"Third Street walkway is a vibrant place with a good choice of places to eat and shop.

One guy walked into a yogurt ice cream little place and loaded up a container, spilling it on the floor and himself and left. This seems the norm but the prom is filled with high street shops and cafes and street singers. June not great time to come can be foolish and no sun .... June gloom x",chelseatraveller121
50,Good place to shop and people watch,Been coming to the Third Street Promenade my whole life. Now as an adult with a family I realized its not the best atmosphere to bring young children to as there are a lot of druggies and homeless throughout and not something you want the little ones exposed to right now.

10,Far too touristy,"There's nothing unique about the promenade except it's outside. All big box stores and chain restaurants. I used to work a block away, and it's always full of both foreign tourists, and tourists from the Valley. Great for local business, but not worth the trip.",Princessdreaa
40,Uhhhhhhhh a real live tourist spot.,Only a few blocks from an ocean view; on the promenade you will find all the national chains including one of those very large Apple stores. You will also find many theaters. I think the biggest attraction is people watching. Tourists from all over the world flock here to do their shopping. As it is expensive I would guess having no VAT makes it relatively less expensive for those from other places. Anyway there are street performers doing their thing in a very appealing street scene. The area is well patrolled with little crime. Good place to take the kids.,paul_nancy1

50,Brilliant Place To Visit,Shoppers Paradise for a day well spent wandering around. If you are young and slim baby are you in for a treat.

30,Peewee's big adventure was filmed here! Ahhhh!,"Every single thing seen featured in the movie from 3rd st prom has been changed since 1985.

Also the intro to fast times at ridgemont high was filmed where the Nike store is now. Cool!",My Info B
40,A nice walk,"Walked through the promenade after our bus dropped us off for the pier and beach time. The promenade had lots of shops and stores to look at and check out. The main walking area had lots of entertainment (clarinet player, mini-michael jackson, etc) and it was a cool change. Was actually looking for a place to buy sunscreen - no drug stores or anything, which was strange. Still a nice area.",Andrew B

50,There's nothing like the Third Street Promenade,"the Third Street Promenade is a must see for all my guests to Santa Monica. Great energy, excellent performers on the street, great shopping and wonderful assortment of food available. Weekends are very busy with lots of people and events going on. People watching at its best.",socalnanynan
40,Pretty interesting,"Somehow we ended up here and walked around. It was awesome to be able to check out all the stores they have to offer but you have to have money. They have some shops with mediocre prices but Louis Vuitton isn't in my realistic budget, just fantasy. Nice to place to go and just walk around.",NicoleT89_89

40,Name brand shopping,Plenty of the usual suspects had stores on the promenade. Traffic is closed which allows for street performers to play which was everything from bad to amazing. It also allowed plenty of homeless a place to live which did not add to the experience bits hard to buy new shoes when you are surrounded by people going through the trash.,JArcana
50,One of my favourite places in the States,You can't help but feel good when visiting the promenade. The amount of eating places and bars is fantastic and coming from down under the bargains to be had in terms of clothes and footwear is amazing.We will be back!,730dalem
50,There is always something fun to do.,"There are many good restaurants, both casual and non casual. Great shops and live entertainment. During non-Summer months, you need to bring a nice warm jacket since you will be only 2 blocks away from the beach. Good place for dates, or family outings. During warmer days public parking is hard to find. Get there early.",Marie M
40,"Entertaining for eating and eye-picking, not so much for shopping.","It is a nice place to find good restaurants and stores, however the prices inside are a bit unfriendly. It is quite good for a sunny day going for a coffee or some ice cream.",Felipe A
30,Nice,"If you're visiting Santa Monica, I would recommend bike riding on the coastal trail and the beach first. If you want to shop, the promenade is a great place to do it. It's a pretty outdoor atmosphere with the same stores you would find in most American malls. There are quite a few homeless people, which made me feel uncomfortable while eating outside at a overpriced restaurant in front of them. There are parking garages conveniently located so depending when you go, you should find a spot.",Marc0mama
50,A must for visitors to Santa Monica,"If you are going to Paris you visit the Eiffel Tower.

40,Great shopping,"Lovely promenade with a great variety of shops. Plenty of department stores and a great variety of eating options. There was a farmers market on the day we were there, what a treat. Best place for parking is in the multi level car park. The street parking is too hard to find and the car park is cost effective also.",Lynnola
50,Nice atmosphere,"It was a lovely area to stroll, window shop, enjoy street-side entertainment. We stopped at Starbucks to have afternoon coffee - asked for iced coffee - what a surprise, it was liquid coffee over ice not like NZ-it was gross.",blondy36
40,"A buzzy street, perfect for people watching",We ambled down this street taking in all the sites. There are plenty of buskers and quirky market stalls. At this time of year the trees are in full blossom and the wide street has quite a European feel. Worth a stroll on a lazy afternoon,Sarsywarsy
50,Has something for everyone,"A little bit of everything - lots of shops, cafes , music (buskers), cinemas and a great bookshop, Love the shopping here as it seems more personal and friendly than say the brand shops on Fifth Avenue and Michigan Avenue.A good variety of cafes but more value ones than say an expensive over the top restaurant.",RonWamberal
40,"Day of shopping, dinner & movie","My wife and I went to the 3rd street promenade to do some shopping. The promenade has something for everyone. There are stores for shopping, restaurants for dining, theaters for movies and so much more.What began as a shopping trip, ended in dinner and a movie. It was a wonderful experience.

40,Clean and safe,Walking along Third Street Promenade is a very pleasant experience. You do not get hassled by salespeople and can stroll along at your own leisure. Shops are varied and plentiful and there are buskers every few hundred yards to lighten the mood and entertain the crowds. On Sundays in the morning there is a fresh fruit and veg market with a wonderful variety of food. In the afternoon there are a couple of groups of people who dance and encourage bystanders to take part.,Amanda1051

50,Prepare to empty your wallet,"This is one of the nicest shopping areas we've ever visited, paved, lots of plants and trees, good (mostly!) buskers, plenty of benches to rest weary feet, as well as loads of restaurants and, of course, a vast array of shops. We (naturally!) gravitated straight towards the Apple Store, but this is a street where you name it, they've got it.An almost carnival-like atmosphere makes a stroll down third street a complete delight.",Mike_Kwasniak
50,Soooo expensive but great food and shopping,"Be sure to visit the awesome girls at Lush and try their products. They got me hooked! Also there is a little cafe with the best crepes EVER (Nutella and coconut!!!). Be aware that the prices are outrageous in the shops for clothes and they are NOT plus size friendly... size 10/12... that is ""plus size"" LOL and they don't go any larger than that as far as I could find.",Renee K
40,An upscale open space and homage to our consumer culture,"Great for strolling and people watching. Yes, there is a glass-fronted Apple store, the latest incarnation of American Apparel and other youth clothing retailers, bars and restaurants, fountains, kiosks and buskers. Oh, the buskers. They run the gamut from very talented open-mikers to people who can't carry a tune. A fun place to walk about and do some people watching.",terere2
50,Can't Miss This One!!!!,"You just can't pass this place up! Yes it's just another mall.... But wait! It's more than that..... It's an outdoor mall, in SoCal & it's in Santa Monica!!!!Ok it has the typical shops & a good many of the high end stores too. There are restaurants, general ones that are just local, not the usual run of the mill food court places. On the weekends, in the evenings it's not uncommon to see street performers.... Or even a band to entertain. Another great stop to make while in Santa Monica!",JT. K

Loads of shops to indulge and street entertainment, great atmosphere.",Joanne marie K
40,"Shopping, Free Entertainment, Great Food Options","Every time I visit the area near Santa Monica, I make a point to go there. It has almost any store you are looking for, free live entertainment, and great choice of restaurants. My husband, children, and I can find food that we can agree upon eating and haven't had a bad experience. Park in one of the garages. Some allow free parking up to, I believe two hours, and it is just around the corner from Third Street Promenade.",7books

30,Used to love it,"Unfortunately there is little of California left on 3rd street which has become more of a high end outside mall. The setting is still fantastic, Anthropologie still has a flagship store, but who needs Champs, Footlocker, Adidas, Apple and all others there... :-) Rents have pushed the local tenants out.There are a few stores left form 7-8 years ago, the Greek restaurant for breakfast, the Toy Store...Will not likely go back soon.",Hilaire2009

50,Many options for everyone!,"My friends and I are major shoppers... so when we heard about 3rd Street, we had to go.

We really enjoyed ourselves here.",SunnyTravels1
50,What a buzz!,"This was a great find on our first night in Santa Monica. Only one block back from the beach and our hotel this was overflowing with atmosphere with street stalls and performers of all shapes and sizes. What a buzz. A great choice of restaurants, coffee shops and bars and even a Tesla outlet where you could check their latest range of vehicles. Thoroughly to be recommended if you are visiting Santa Monica.",MikeH1949
40,"Great, clean and open shopping","I am a natural born shopper and I loved this area. Plenty of shopping variety, nice open plaza area for plenty of sunlight and space so its never too crowded.",Leebell82
50,Leisurely stroll,My wife and I went there for mothers day.. The weather was good. Really enjoyed people watching and the street performers. Plenty of cafes with outdoor seating..

50,Tourist Mecca in Santa Monica,The Third Street Promenade has become a tourist mecca for travelers all over the world. There is a variety of shops movie theaters and restaurants. A Jason is a fairly new Shopping Center with major department stores and boutique shops alike. The only thing I don't like is the parking and the congested traffic in this area. I would suggest taking an Uber to from this location. Take a stroll along Ocean Avenue and enjoy the Magnificent views out to eat Santa Monica Bay and its coastline. The Santa Monica Pier is in walking distance from this location.,David G
30,Too many chain shops,It had been about 10 years since my last visit and was saddened to see that the charm is gone. Nothing but a street of chain stores connected to a mall. Most of the nice local restaurants are replaced with chains.,YULtravels

20,Overrun with homeless people and mall stores,"Another disappointing thing in Santa Monica. It's well put together and designed, but almost all the stores are straight from the mall. Montana Avenue is much better for variety. If you are a mall person come here. Also a ton of homeless people, 2-3 on each block, some begging aggressively. The street musicians were good but again there were 2-3 on each block and they were playing over each other.",Tim B
50,Great for shops and restaurants,We discovered Third Street Promenade in the evening and there are bars and restaurants in the area. It also looked great for shopping but we weren't there long enough! A great area to check out.,HolidayCaz

50,Lots of shopping/eating options,"3rd Street Promenade has all of the stores most malls have and a few others. Mixed in is multiple restaurants and snack shops. It is well kept and a nice, safe area. Much better than shopping on Montana Ave. It is all outdoors so not a great option if rainy. Located just a couple of blocks from the Santa Monica beach. No entrance fee as expected.",ctaylor0159
50,A Walkable Experience,We visited on a Friday evening and it was a fun place to see. We parked at the north end in a very reasonable parking garage so we could walk the entire pedestrian only Promenade. There's a ton of national retailers and restaurants but the best part of the street are all of the street performers. We saw everything from a 6 year old dancing Michael Jackson to folks that we're still thinking about what they were doing. It's a fun outing but don't go too late as everything was finished by 10 pm.,Jay V
50,Fun shopping and dining,"I stayed right around the corner at the Ocean View hotel. Super nice, and great walking distance from Third Street Promenade. We ate at Cafe la Crepe and enjoyed the French toast crepe and smoked salmon bagel.On another day, we shopped at the stores along the street and enjoyed the street artists performing along the way. I love Lush and was happy to find one here.On our final day, we found a vendor right off of the Promenade that sold travel items - we needed a travel pillow and were able to scoop one up at a better price than the airport. Starbucks also came in handy to grab a drink and charge our phones",Ashlee K
30,Cool visit,"Nice little spot to shop & walk around. Very safe, nice statues, pretty walkway, lots of shopping stores- on the pricey side, but with a variety of food- Greek, Spanish , Italian & Japanese.There's a nearby dance school & they put on a show right in the middle.",christinarodriguez29
30,A Little Tired,Look I live in Los Angeles and I come here periodically. While nice and a place to kill a few hours and get a dinner I think it wears after a while. In the mall they have made that higher end. I think they ruined the mall in my opinion. The street has a lot of stores geared to surfers and skate board people.The places to eat is where it is at. They have a wide variety of great places. Lots to discover in food here.Be ready for a lot of homeless people. That part very sad.,Jon Simmons

40,It Keeps Changing,"I've lived in Santa Monica for many years and the Third Street Promenade keeps changing. The mix of businesses, restaurants, theaters and offices changes on a yearly basis. I remember the days when it was just a 'walk street' with the concrete benches until today where the modern retailers are with the street carnival/entertainers. You have to come out on Wednesday and Saturday mornings for the organic farmers market.",Mitchel N

40,good people watching,If you like high end malls this is a step down. It has everything you need--except truly high end. Some fun street performers and lots of people give it a vibe. The mall that anchors it to the South is solid: Bloomingdales etc and the promenade has a range of offerings. Not bad,expectquality1942
50,Great shopping and fun!,"We live near one of the largest malls in the USA (King of Prussia, PA) and we loved the Promenade! Great high end stores, places to snack and eat outdoors, entertainers and more. There were shops of interest for the entire family and a great place to just sit and watch the people! Not like the mall at home where you are on a shopping mission. This was actually relaxing!!!",Gruuveeone
50,Awesome walking experience!,"You don't need to splurge to have fun in this beautiful shopping street! The entire street is walled off for pedestrians only for a few blocks, and it's filled with so many cool shrubbery and various art pieces. In addition to some interesting looking shops like the massive glass-only Apple Store, Third Street Promenade is simply a cool place to stroll through and check out!Plus, parking is free for 90 minutes and it's super close to the famous Santa Monica Pier, so why not swing by and walk through this promenade? I definitely recommend walking through here as a part of your Santa Monica experience.",jayyen93
50,Cleanest mall I've seen!,"I stumbled across the promenade after leaving the shopping centre looking for the beach! It is immaculate. Tree lined, beautiful known name shops, buskers, restaurants. It has it all and just near the beach. It's great for a stroll and people watching.",Stagmouth

50,Always fun! You can see stars here,"We have been visiting this fun place for many years. The city of Santa Monica has closed 4 street blocks and made them into a walking mall, entertainment and eatery place all in one. On weekends you can see all sort of people here as well as stars. I have seen 3 famous people casually walking out of the theater or seeping a drink at one of the many restaurants with patios. There are a lot of high quality street performers just waiting to be discovered by a recording studio or movie producer. There are some acts that may never make it there, but some are quiet impressive. You can park here and walk to the famous Santa Monica Pier. Great to walk with the family, go to the beach and grab a bite and entertainment all in one place.Venice beach is near by as well as Malibu.",lxjuarez

20,No personality!,"The promenade itself is okay...a nice, wide pedestrian-only zone...nice for walking. But it lacks and personality or local feel. The retail shops are almost all big low-mid tier brands and retailers...almost nothing local or unique. Likewise with the restaurants. There is a little art and some moderate landscaping, but very little that's truly interesting or special.",Dollyamas
40,"Stores, restaurants and people","In short, a shopping street with some restaurants, cafés, a few bars and lots and lots of different shops. Walking up and down the street, looking at the crowd is rather nice be it day or night. The area is not exactly touristy but you get your fair amount of travellers passing through the area as the beach front draws a large crowd at lunch and dinner time. Great shopping and nice restaurants for sure.",AndyLA76

20,Nothing Special,"Although convenient for tourists without a car, the shopping is the same as you can find in any good-sized mall. I found it too crowded, too commercial and lacking the character of the ""real"" Santa Monica",Janice O

It's a short walk to the beach.",Nikkitz
30,"So so, good for one hour walk","Well this is a copy of european city promenade, there you will find the same international brands that you find everywhere in the world, nothing specific, no native art, nothing really out of ordinary.

30,Lots of stores and street entertainment,We were here last year and it seemed to be better then. This time the street entertainment wasn't as good and some of them was quite dumb.

Eateries galore! Plan to be here mid-morning through lunch, you won't be disappointed. Everything from coffee shops, specialty food places, to fancier ""business lunch"" type places. The Big Blue Bus can be an okay way to get there & back to LA/Beverly Hills area. Just do your research on the routes, and ask the locals if you run into trouble (we ran across a very very rude driver when trying to use a transfer). The Promenade is only a couple blocks from Ocean Drive/Palisades Park. Worth spending a few hours in this area to relax and get some retail therapy.",koya65

30,Not as cool as it used to be.,"I have not been back to this place in over 10+ years. Since then, it looks like this place has turned into an outdoor mall full of your typical clothing and restaurant chains. There were a few street performers but it is no longer unique and special like it used to be. I live in Orange County so it is unlikely that I will make the 1-hour drive to this place again since we have other outdoor malls like the Block or Fashion Island. Disappointed!",jt99941

Then, I head to my favorite restaurant here, the Lottoria Grill, a small LA Mexican chain, but the Santa Monica location does it best. This is high class elegant Mexican food and not the garden variety Mexican food. They have indoor and outdoor seating and the spicy margarita is amazing! Enjoy this place!",CarterJonErickson
50,Everything a shopper could possibly want,"Loved shopping here for two days. There is just about every franchise store here that you would expect to find in the U.S. The Promenade has multiple street entertainers for all ages, eateries, two cinemas and interesting garden sculptures to view along the way. Not so good if it is raining as there is no cover, so take your umbrella or buy one before everyone else (they were sold out).",B L

30,Pretty typical for a big city,"Have you ever been to a shopping mall in 21st century America? The third street promenade is just like an outdoor mall.

But certainly not a transcendent experience.",DoctorM

30,Nice stroll through a shopping and dining area,"We passed through Third Street Promenade on the way to the beach. There are shops, cafes, and restaurants (as you would expect), but other than that, nothing too noteworthy other than a few street performers. Parking is also much cheaper in this area ($7 for 3.3 hours, versus $4 per 15 minutes near the beach) if you don't mind the short walk to the beach.I wouldn't recommend coming to Santa Monica just for the promenade, but rather if you're already heading to the pier or beach and will be in the area.",Daniko8

40,Lots of the same shops as everywhere else but nicer environment,"One of the nicest things about this shopping area is the street performers. They must curate who plays because many of them are surprisingly talented. Most of the stores are outposts of national chains, but some of the restaurants are unique to the area.

40,What a fun shopping and dining location.,"We were visiting the Santa Monica area and asked the Concierge at a nearby hotel where we could go if we didn't want to brave the crowds on the Santa Monica Pier. It was suggested that we try walking about 2 blocks from the beach to check out the Third Street Promenade a local shopping and dining area.We were very surprised on how nice and clean the street was and how many stores, coffee spots and dining were there. We walked a few blocks and saw street performers playing music, singing and generally entertaining people as we strolled the street.I don't remember if automobile traffic was allowed to drive through but it seemed like lots of people were there to enjoy the nice weather and be near the beach.If you have time and are in the area, I would definitely stop by and enjoy the shops.",gyee50

30,"Nice outdoor mall, but mostly chain stores","The title pretty much sums it up. The best thing about Third Street Promenade is its location near the beach. Most of the stores are chain stores. For a while the food offerings were awful, but some really good restaurants have opened over the past year or two. Just not actually ON the promenade. The good food is near, but not on, the promenade. Actually, pretty much everything good is near, but not on, the promenade.",Tommy T

40,Worth a Visit....,"Its a wonderful experience to visit this lively shopping,cultural and dining district.Our tour bus dropped us on a warm afternoon there.Its a wonderful pedestrain only street,worth a visit at least even if you dont wana shop.Beautifully decorated with Dinosaur themed fountain and trees.The vibe outside attracts you so much that you can spend hours and hours here.For shopping Gap,Apple,Zara,H & M all leading brands are here.A 2 storey shopping complex is also there featuring Luis Vitton,MK etc.Kiosks at street are offering beautiful handicrafts which are worth seeing.I bought a hard plastic case for my Note 4 which was beautifully painted themed California Yatcht Club.One can find great eating options and pubs as well.Tip:For shopping one must remember that every USA state has different tax ratio on purchases.For example in California the tax was 9.8% but in New York its about 12%.",Naureen Y
40,Lets keep it like a village,Great pedestrian street with accompanying live entertainment at certain peak times.Would be better if kept to private stores instead of so many multinationals creeping in which can be found in most shopping malls.A unique shopping experience it isnt but reasonably villagee.,David M

20,"Good streetscape, Seedy atmosphere","Third Street Promenade should be a really great place to see and be seen. It has a wonderful location and atmosphere which promises much. Yet on a recent 5 day visit to Santa Monica we were really disappointed. By day it feels safe. By night, not so much. There seems to be a homeless person picking through each garbage can or lounging on the public seating. One night very late a large unappealing group of mostly men gathered to watch a disjointed street performance by a middle aged woman who seemed to be doing some art of gypsy dance. It just felt weird and unsafe and we all trundled home. The whole scene was a far cry from how I remembered the place a few years ago. Big box retailers have put down stakes here and that cheapens the mood, too.The Santa Monica police and urban planning commission have some work to do on this zone.",Thegoodegg
50,Excellent shopping!,"I absolutely love the 3rd St. Promenade in Santa Monica. There is excellent shopping here. It is a pedestrian only street with all kinds of shops on both sides of the road. At one far end there is a 2 storey outdoor mall. There are plenty of restaurants and cafes along the street, and it is central to all the great Santa Monica attractions and beaches. There are plenty of parking options both street metered parking, and an 8 storey parking garage within very close proximity. I will definitely be returning the next time I visit Santa Monica.",willeykim

Most had their doors propped open to the night air.Most stores accept small leashed dogs and we saw plenty of them — some in proper dog shoes, even!We parked in a multi-level garage off the promenade. Easy in and out. There were plenty of opportunities to snack or have a meal. It was clean and vibrant, we felt safe.",travelredcard

40,"Great area to stroll, shop, eat","Clean, well-maintained with dinosaur topiaries, a decent range of eateries, shops, movie theaters and one of the few remaining bookstores in the area. Three blocks to beach with more restaurants and shopping enroute to ocean as well as high end mall anchoring promenade to the south at Pico. Street performers and small cart vendors add to the interest, drawing large crowds in the evenings and weekends. One of the nicest outdoor areas in the city, safe and smoke free on promenade.",Catbird28

40,Great shopping,Only blocks from the pier. Nice stores. Again something for everyone. You will be sorry if you dont. Ditch the car and take the metro train/bus. Metro card pass for day only $9. Will cost way more to gas a car and park,Amir E

40,Great walking street,"Santa Monica is a favourite tourist destination if one is in Los Angeles. We drove down from Torrance and used PCH 1 for quite some distance to avoid the dense traffic On reaching Santa Monica, parked the car in one of the many public parking buildings available (not cheap) and headed towards this great walking street. It is a great shopping street with a mixture of stores catering to all pockets. There are street musicians, tourist carts and very happy go lucky, fun atmosphere on this entire street. A stroll on it is recommended even if one does not do any shopping.",Banrist
50,Great Shopping and dining,"Third street Promenade offers a great selection of shopping, dining, and entertainment. I love the street entertainers too. Reclining seats at the AMC was my big find on this visit.",Shoshana P

50,Something for everyone,"We spent Christmas afternoon shopping here, not a lot was open but it still offered a great afternoon with a few street artists and a number of shops with sales on. On a normal trading day it would be a great shopping location with a number of food stalls. These are main stream shops, not market or pop up stalls.",Globefisher

40,Great shopping and walk!,"One of my favorite open shopping areas in L.A. It's safe, clean and something for everyone. Great hidden food gems from Umami Burgers and Pono burgers (casual) to more expensive BOA and robata bar but most accessible by walking. Just be careful with knowing where to walk as things can get a bit sketchy real quick and if you have small children you don't want to be walking around the dark off the beaten path.",Toyo3

30,Essentially an Outdoor Mall,"I am not s a shopper, but, even so, I know a mall when I see one. Depending on where you are from, you can probably take most of the chain stores in your local mall, double or triple the floor space and place it on a curb rather than in a kiosk, and you've got the Third Street Promenade. So, if you like that sort of thing, the Promenade will be a great opportunity to see each merchandiser's entire collection at one site. If mall shopping is not your thing, the Promenade is still a pleasant walk.",westsidecouple
40,Christmas shopping,"I didn't want to go to another mall and was recommended to go here by an Uber driver, and I'm glad I did. It's a bit like an open-air mall. The usual shops and places to eat, but it's outside and there's a lot of entertainment competing for your ears. There are also stands which sell crafty things. Good place to spend a couple of hours and do a bit of Christmas shopping.",Kiwigirl341

The Promenade ends at Santa Monica Place which has a Nordstrom's, Bloomingdale's and other upscale stores.

Definitely a place to visit.",Morris K
40,Good place to take a walk/shop,"Probably one of the most famous touristy places Santa Monica. Lots of street performers. Mostly shops/restaurants.

50,Shop til you drop,"I don't usually like to go shopping with my wife because she loves to shop for a long time and spend money. I have to say though it was actual not so bad. We bought Christmas presents for the kids, it was a very nice sunny day and there was a Starbucks. It is an outdoor mall with no cars zooming past once you get to the Promenade. Just be careful crossing the streets to get there as all drivers in California are always in a hurry. Starting Friday nights the place is crowded but it has a certain buzz to the area and the street performers are pretty good. Remember to just go and have fun and be yourself.",Markjmco
40,Great shopping,Terrific for a day of shopping. Always specials on offer and a great selection for all tastes. Nice to sit and watch the crowds go by with a coffee and listen to the buskers singing. Keep your eye out for the odd celebrity. There is always one there.,fisher1962
50,Fabulous for some light shopping and a nice walk outside,This is a lovely location when you want to do a little bit of shopping in a relaxed atmosphere. There is also a Pizza place (unfortunatley I cannot remember the name) which is the best I have ever had. It is a small boutique with space to eat Pizza slices outside. Love it and would highly recommend it.,SN1

The Christmas decorations are nice, not over done. There are some homeless people around but not as bad as near the pier so I prefer this destination with children over it. There is plenty to do and see here, even if you just get a Jamba Juice and walk about, it's a fun place to spend a few hours. On the top level of the nearby mall, there is a nice wine bar where you can relax and have a reasonably priced meal.",EZGoingTraveler10001

This time, I parked at the pier for six dollars and walked up to the pier, and then walked to the promenade, and back very easy and pleasant. The street music and's to the general upbeat vibe.

40,Very unique and crowded area,"Had dinner at the Beanery. The entire Promenade was absolutely hopping. Not a fan of crowds but tried to take it all in a positive way.

40,Good attempt at a European pedestrian shopping area.,"This was a refreshing change - shops located close together without cars driving up the middle of the street.

50,Everything you need!,"We must look like tourists, but before we could even say Third Street Promenade, a 'concierge' came up and asked what we were looking for along the street, and then gave us directions for this particular store!

30,Average stores with streets full of street performers.,"We were told that there was great shopping here on the Third Street Promenade, they were sorely wrong. You can find any of these stores at practically any mall in America. The streets are full of little kiosks and street performers hoping to get a buck.

50,Amazing Shopping,Such an amazing place to go to.Plenty to shop & see.I would recommend putting a day and taking your time throughout the area. I would start from the stop and slowly making your way down then eventually hitting Santa Monica BLVD to eat and wondering around the beach area.No special sales at such but stores are more grand such as the Nike store is huge (2 storey) which makes more options.,ellieyngu
40,Good Shopping Samo,This is one the most concentrated shopping areas on the westside lots of great chain stores and options. that being said it is only mainstream chain stores you will find on the promenade so if you want more boutique shopping experience in Santa Monica go to Main St or Montana. Always clean and they have staff walking around to help tourists find their favorite spots,allison r
50,Amazing pedestrian way.,"Many blocks long, packed with every store imaginable on both sides, the promenade is a worthwhile expedition. Start by parking in one of the cheap city garages on 4th street (follow signs for parking as you get closer to ocean), and just walking. There are a few stand alone booths in the middle that are also worth checking out (my daughters scored some cute dresses in one). The only downside is the extensive homelessness here. It's everywhere in LA, but seems to be in greater numbers on the promenade and lining the front outskirts of the beach. This is a kind of homelessness you don't see in New England, where the winters force the homeless inside and into a shower, at least for a few months of the year. These are people who haven't taken a bath/washed their clothes in years. Even the destitute want to hang out in Santa Monica, it seems.",KBBostonBoston

40,Amazing! Worth a trip,"My mom and I lovedddd this shopping center. Especially when it's outside, it feels amazing and walking around watching people perform their talent such as singing or playing the yoyo. The only downside is that it needs more bathrooms. The closest one was the Starbucks one, and we waited about 30 minutes in line with the rest of the people. However, the shopping is amazing. Good stores, most are two stories.

Now McDonalds, Chipotle, Guess, Old Navy and all the chains have moved in to make this like any other corporate mall. The have destroyed the very thing that attracted them here.

30,Really gone down,"I was very sad to see how this place had gone down. One of the reasons I had selected to stay at the Fairmont for this visit to Santa Monica was its proximity to the promenade. It had been a few years since I had been there and it has changed, and sadly, not for the better.Gone were the variety of independent shops and restaurants. There mostly seemed to be chain stores and only one fine dining restaurant with outdoor dining. Frankly, the smell of urine was so pervasive along the promenade I couldn't imagine eating any where along there, especially outside. This used to be one of my favorite places in Santa Monica, now its just sad.",LucySLasVegas_NV

The clothing shops cater mostly to a young crowd, teens through twenties, offering the basics such as jeans, tops, sneakers, and caps. The restaurants include Italian, Greek, American, and seafood, many with both indoor and outdoor seating. Cafes offer a choice of hot and iced coffee-based drinks, ice cream, frozen yogurt, crepes, and snacks for most every taste. Other shops provide great places to shop or just browse, offering books, cards, leather goods, and souvenirs. On the day I visited, there were street musicians and entertainers, some drawing large crowds but displaying little talent. When I needed a quiet moment, I ventured down a side street from the main promenade and enjoyed a good cup of coffee, The New York Times, and relief from the hubbub at the Interactive Cafe.",Loraine H

There are plenty of people most times of day to people watch and numerous street performers. When we were there several played music, and another added humor. Every evening there seemed to be different performers. We enjoyed several good meals including breakfast before the crowds at a crepe restaurant, burgers, and pizza.

Apparently Santa Monica is very homeless friendly which is great and there is a soup kitchen set up near the promenade some evenings which means that rough sleeping folks congregate later in the evening. It was just a strange mixture at first, high end shops and people down on their luck but there was no hint of anything nasty, quite the opposite, shoppers/diners, tourists and rough sleepers all in a strange harmony.",craigcargill
40,Place to shop and eat~,"Our family of 5 (with 3 small kids) visited the Third Street Promenade in the late afternon for shopping and dinner after spending time first at the Santa Monica Pier. The Third Street Promenade is a very lively places with tons of shops and eateries. My wife loves the variety of shops here. Since this place is all outdoors, it feels a bit different from the many indoor shooping malls in the area. It is also a good place to people-watch and just to sit around in a cafe to relax. All in all, this place is a very good place to shop and eat.",saesolbyeol

I am one of those 5 minute shoppers: go in, look what I need and I am out of there in 5 mins either I find it or not....BUT this is not bad place to shop. It is outdoor shopping which keeps things airy and less claustrophobic. There is a nice selection of high and low end shops. Something for everyone. At Broadway end there is Santa Monica Place which is the ""more mall like structure"". With more shops. And one great gelato place Ugo's and restaurants. And soon movie theater. Oh and there are lots of street performers at 3rd Street. Can be entertaining - or not.....depends on you. You can park at 2nd and 4th Street and Santa Monica Place with quite reasonable price (1,5 hrs free).

Moderate sized shopping centre at southern end, superb bookshop (Hennessey and Ingallis) just around the corner at northern end. Well landscaped (flowering dinosaur fountains) and street performers from the weird to the wonderful add character. Essential for all Santa Monica visitors and far better than the tacky pier.",Warwick C
50,Third Street Promenade for Shopping,"Excellent pedestrian space for people to enjoy shopping brand-name clothes, and have a fine dining experience while in Los Angeles.My favorite store here is Mac, for beauty supplies (for women, as well as men).The second store I like is the MAC store, where you can attend daily courses on how to use your cell phones, or MACBook Pro. Bands are playing along the promenade, and people are strolling quite content to have their pets, as most restaurants are pet friendly. Lovely site-seeing, very L.A.",olazin

30,Let's be realistic about Third Street,"It's somewhat extraordinary that the Third Street Promenade — really, nothing more than an outdoor shopping mall — is essentially thought of as a must do attraction in Santa Monica. Now, there's nothing wrong with the shopping experience, if that's what you're after — but retail-wise, there's hardly anything offered here that can't be found in any major city's shopping district, or in a typical upscale-ish shopping mall.An irony is that, less than a mile south of the promenade, Santa Monica's Main Street becomes an honestly interesting shopping strip, with many truly distinctive and independent shops. By all means, check out Main Street if interesting shopping is what you want. Skipping the Promenade, you won't necessarily have missed a lot.",Damfino
40,Crowded Fun!,"Third Street Promenade is ""A Must"" while visiting the area. It is a pedestrian area with shops, restaurants, fun Kiosks to view or shop and street entertainment galore!

The prices are not as low as the ones in outlets but you can enjoy an open area shopping experience under the palms, spend some time taking pictures in front of the beautifully decorated botanical works in the middle of the street (the street is closed to traffic by the way), having food or drink in one of the many restaurants for every different taste.

40,Super-trendy Outdoor Mall,"Lots of places to eat, street performers and cool shops. A little loud with the different performers competing for attention.

30,Fine for upscale shopping,"I have a rule I don't go places when I travel that I can go to at home... Ergo, most of the 3rd St Promenade falls into this category. If you like upscale shopping at all the regulars, then this is for you. I prefer local, interesting places that you can't find on every corner in every city. One exception is Penzys Spices on 4th, just one block over from the Promenade. If you like to cook then definitely check Penzys out!",Cindy W
40,Great strip to cruise,"I love this street, as it has atmosphere, great street entertainers, eateries, bars, shops and many other attractions to just get lost in the moment with.

40,Cool Place to spend an afternoon walking and shopping,"Although none of the stores are unique, it is a nice place to walk and eat and shop. I was lucky enough to hit the massive Farmer's market one day and was surprised at the crowds. Fun place to hang out!",Lorraine B
30,Bit dissapointing!,"I was hoping for a few more local boutiques and quirky shops but it is really just ""high street"" style shops and fast food. Not as big as I was expecting either.. Worth the trip if you are going to the pier anyway but nothing spectacular",Coralie D
40,Farmer's Market an Additional Plus,"Walking around the third street promenade enjoying the music and watching the people is a great way to spend the morning but when you add the farmer's market on Wednesday and Saturday mornings you are in for a real treat. Blocks and blocks of fresh fruits, nuts of all types and vegetables that are available make this a weekly stop for us. We forward to loading our shopping bag with berries, beets, avocados and whatever else catches our eyes.",geckobvi
20,"Tourists, boring shops and mediocre buskers","I have seen the change here over 25 yrs. It was revamped and pedestrianised in the late 80's. Old shops like Woolworth and JC Penney went, and for a decade or more, the street had interesting, quirky shops. The tourists caught on, footfall increased, and the big boys moved in. There is an Apple Store, Gap, Victoria's Secret etc ( all the usual suspects) and no soul or interest any more. The place is completely devoid of anyone local. It has( mostly) poor buskers (why does anyone think they are necessary?), average restaurants and the planners are now allowing dreadful store designs, which will completely finish the job. The Apple store is too big and the design has no place in the area, and the abomination of the Chile Beanery (which, bizzarely, sell glasses) is an affront to all. Shame on the planners.If you want big name shops, average restaurants, average/poor buskers and to be surrounded by tourists, this is the place to come . Dire",clarksdale

20,Like a typical mall,Was disappointed to see this place turn into just another strip of predictable chain stores. It could be the same outdoor mall in Miami. I have seen the evolution of this area since before the prominade was built. It was much better in the early days.,DCgogirl

30,Just Another Mall,I had high expectations for the Promenade. I had heard so many good things. I was very disappointed. It was just another outdoor mall with the same stores that are everywhere. Too many pan handlers and street people for me. I will say they have people at each corner to give you advice and to help you find your way. I think that is to keep the hawkers from bothering you. I found Main Street to be more to my liking.,Susanretired2013

40,Fun place to visit and do some shopping,"We were here during our recent holiday vacation. We had just finished eating dinner, and wanted to walk off some calories. TSP is always a nice and fun lively place. Whether during the day or during the evening, it's a nice place to do a variety of things. Entertainers line the area showcasing their talents. As nice of an area as it may seem, there were a few aggressive donation seekers, if you know what I mean.On this particular visit, our walk turned into shopping. We found some great buys, which probably was helped by the holiday shopping season.Parking was not too hard to come by,which was nice.Grounds area was clean and nicely decorated.

I love going in to Tiffany's (for fun) and strolling all the way down and enjoying the street vendors too. Loads and loads of street performers are in the center of the street. I have seen stars like Matthew McConaughey, Reese Witherspoon, and Kate Hudson. Keep your eyes open. There are loads of SM parking garages on 4th St., and you get the first two hours free.",calgal405

30,Open street shopping mall,"Probably one of the most expensive retail real estate in Los Angeles, the old mom and pop shops that used to line the street have long gone, replaced by the Apple Stores and Forever 21's, so if you expect to find unique stores, you will be mostly out of luck. But, the street still retains some of the qualities that attract so many locals and tourists alike. Street performers abound at night and weekends, drawing crowds that linger for a few minutes to watch the shows. Most of the restaurants on the street are forgettable, but there are several good ones on the side streets. People watching, the proximity to the Santa Monica Pier, the cool weather, and relative ease of parking on the several city owned lots are the reasons to come by.",Michael K
50,Excellent Choice,"Heaps of choice for food and also really good shopping. Be careful of the guys ""giving"" you a CD and then asking for a donation even though they are ""free"" CDs, when refused money the CD was taken away. Just walk and say you're not interested. People trying to scam money from you as well - just ignore everyone you don't know.",Jake S

50,Great Selection of Eating Connected to Many Nearby Attractions,"3rd Street Promenade is an enjoyable outdoor mall with fun dinosaur topiary and lots of shops and photo ops. But it's best seen as part of the connected attractions that are all right here. From here, you can walk to the Pier, the lovely park overlooking the ocean, and the beach and the bike trail. There are high quality restaurants, but also inexpensive counter-type places serving all sorts of food. One of the best surviving Barnes and Noble bookstores is here connected to a Starbucks. There are also two movie theaters. So 3rd Street Promenade is best seen as part of a very full day excursion to Santa Monica or as part of a vacation made by staying in one of the many great nearby hotels.",Robert B

20,Skip it.,"Unless you are looking for stores/shopping that you can find anywhere in the US, don't waste your time. Parking is a pain in the butt, traffic can be horrendous, and there is nothing truly authentic about it. You would be better served spending your time on Montana street if shopping is what you want. Or, just drive up the Pacific Coast Highway and enjoy the view.",Brian C
50,Check it out if in Santa Monica,"We were glad that our uber drive suggested that we check out 3rd street after we checked out the pier.

50,What a Pleasant Surprise!,"We visited the LA area for 3 days. Two of these days were dedicated to Anaheim (Disney Parks). We weren't very sure on what to do with our 3rd day. We wanted to see the beaches but were not decided on which.After some debate we decided for Santa Monica. And we knew of the existance of 3rd St Promenade because a store locator of a shop gave us that address.We visited 3rd Street Promenade after spending some wonderful time at the piear and the beach (which I highly recommend).We had no time for reading reviews so we didn't know what to expect.This is a wonderful stroll on a really nice street, with all the shops and restaurants you can imagine, streets performers and really nice decorative lights at night.We did some shopping, and at the very end there is a mall with more shops (Disney Store for the little ones) and a Food Court, where we grabbed something to eat, seated on a gorgeous terrace.If not for the shopping, the place is worth a visit just to absorb the atmosphere.I think there is parking at the mall (for which I don't know the rate), but we left our car in one of the public parking lots for $2/hour. It worked out great and the machines accept credit cards.Even though this was a day trip (and the last full day of our vacations) it was very hard for us to leave for the hotel.I highly recommend this walk to anyone!!Mx",MX1977
30,Tourists and Obnoxious Noise,"Street performers compete for attention and handouts, overlapping their amplified (and sometimes obnoxious) sounds in the center mall area of the Promenade. It is overwhelming and noisy. Crowds mill about aimlessly, blocking access for those who are actually going somewhere.",whitemice46
50,Great mix of shops,"Great mix of shops...everything from H&M to Louis Vuitton and in-between. Dessert shops, too. Also offers a mix of shops for men (including Apple, surf shops, etc.).

30,Come in the Summer,"This used to be THE place to be and be seen, but in recent years (due to the recession) many of the shops have gone out of business. There are still a number of empty storefronts. There is still decent street entertainment on the weekends, but not so much during the week. Paid parking is available in a number of nearby, tall, parking structures.",RabbiWendy
50,Amazing place,"I pass these streets every day and I never get bored. It always has a refreshing atmosphere. The streets are very clean and pedestrian friendly. There is always good music (from the amazing performers there). A sea breeze always blows gently, which is amazing. You'll never feel like you're breathing in polluted air here! Moreover, the beach is just 3 blocks away.Stores: There is both high-end boutiques and affordable clothing stores such as H&M. Food is both diverse and delicious (mostly). There is an indoor/outdoor mall called Santa Monica Place at the end of the promenade, which is amazing too.",Athenalim
30,First Visit Tourists Only,This crowded main street of common retail stores is set in a bucolic beachside setting with palm trees and blue skies. It is perfect for first-time visitors looking for a retail outdoor experience with all fresco dining.There is a scummy element of Santa Monica with its ample amount of homeless people and dirty streets--but this is also part of the scene that many refer to as the Peoples Republic of Santa Monica.If you were looking for a more refined and unique experience perhaps Montana Avenue is a more accurate and realistic Los Angeles experience. But if you basically one and outdoor Westfield mall set on the spectaculars Cliffside location than this crowded and noisy place might be perfect for you.,TRVLtruth
40,Promenade!,"The Third st Promenade has just about everything you might need. There are stores of every kind. Super crowded on summer nights and weekends and you will definitely need a reservation for any of the restaurants during those months as well. I mean its pretty much a giant outdoor mall. It very clean and well taken care of. There are guides whom roam up and down it constantly if you get turned around or need help finding anything. Lot of parking nearby but these also fill up during the busy times. Check it out, its one of things Santa Monica is know for. Plus there are dinosaur hedges/fountains!",Jack S
50,Fun place to hang out,"I've been to the Promenade many times, but never to the Farmer's Market. A couple of vendors at my local farmer's market had told me about the SM market at the Promenade on Saturdays, so I went and wasn't disappointed. Lots of vendors. Beautiful produce, locally made herbal teas, pistachios, jams & jellies. Frankly, the shops on the Promenade are mostly chains, so other than the fact that it's more fun to be in than a mall, I don't particularly shop there. But, I LOVE the people watching and he street entertainers. And, because there's no vehicle traffic, it's a great spot to take kids. Also, there are public restrooms available in the parking garages.",P P

Street performers in the after noons and evenings. Shoppes , theaters and lots of eateries of all kinds.

Its worth it if you are having fun!",Barry684

Bring wipes or hand bacterial liquid and be careful where you sit as it has a high population of homeless which are pretty much harmless , but you still want to be aware. The shops on the promenade are not rare or different and you can find the same things for less else where and the sales tax is higher in Santa Monica than in other places in So. Cal.

50,There is something for everyone and only a couple of blocks away from the ocean.,"I love going to the third street promenade. They have a variety of stores, where you can find something for everyone. There are many name brand stores like Old Navy, Nike, Clarks, and upscale stores like Sephora. There is even a discount shoe store. And addition to stores, there are many restaurants or you can sit outside on the patio or dine inside. There are many Mexican and Italian food places among other varieties. There is also a large Apple store here and a Barnes and Noble. As it is getting harder to find bookstores, it is a breath of fresh air. There are many many cafés to stop along the way.What makes the third street promenade unique is that it is closed to traffic. Therefore, you walk in the street and there are many street performers. The best performers are on Saturday and Sunday. You may see street dancers, magic acts, opera singing, and much more as you stroll down the street. At the end of the promenade you will reach a modern mall that was rebuilt in 2010. This mall also has department stores, name brands, Disney store, and a food court.From here you are a couple blocks away from Palisades Park in which you have a beautiful view of the ocean. This is a great spot to view the sunset.You are also in walking distance of the Santa Monica pier. It is a great day for anyone who wants to enjoy a stroll outside, shop, see some entertainment, and enjoy the fresh sea air.There are parking structures nearby. The first 90 minutes are free. I usually spend 4 to 5 hours in this area. I pay between four and six American dollars. There are other places to park further away that are cheaper. Santa Monica also has great public transportation. I hope this is helpful.",Janet M

30,Love the promenade - but worried - is it declining?,We go to the promenade every time we are in Santa Monica - I absolutely love going there. Sad to say that this time I felt like it was becoming a little run down? Several stores are closed down. Hoping this was just a fluke and that my impression was off base - because I have never felt this way before. Bloomingdales and Nordstrom were as strong as ever. Just the stores along the street felt a little more empty than usual - esp with so many closed down. :(,SusieQ2223

Whether it's for breakfast, lunch or dinner, movies, shopping, or to just sit in the sun and listen to or watch the buskers, this will be an area you will return to more than once if you're visiting Santa Monica. Definitely more upmarket than last time we were here three years ago, particularly as regards the shopping experience. Very clean and without the 'rough sleepers' evident elsewhere in Santa Monica.

Pleasant weather, good strolling, the light effect on the ferris wheel is a lot of fun if you stare long enough to forget there is a structure behind it. I spent a couple hours before a red eye out and it's decently close to the airport so you don't feel pressured. Parking is reasonable. Plenty of available food & drink. I actually might check out the hotels in the area next visit, as it's nice to have a little night life going on in the evening.

My phone was broken and I needed to purchase one right away. I had no upgrades available so I purchased one for over 600.00 dollars. When I returned home I had problems with the phone so I called Apple customer service. After being tossed from one service personnel to another. After over two hours, an Apple representative said that he would call the store where I purchased the phone and we would have a conference call. The store employee said that I would have to come to the store and physically return the phone. I had my phone for 14 days and it was already broken. I live on Kauai with no Apple store. I was sold a defective phone and they would not accept a phone by mail. The guy on the phone was so rude that even the online support help was appalled. I will never ever buy an Apple product again.

40,Nice area to walk around and shop,"Went on a beautiful Saturday while at Santa Monica beach and pier and had a good time. It's a convenient location close to the beach so we walked there easily. Unfortunately because I had no room for anything extra in my suitcase, I couldn't shop in the stores like I wanted to :( So I definitely recommend this more for people that didn't fly. Then again, most of the stores are the same ones you can find anywhere else. Since we were only there briefly, the only thing we bought was some gelato from a stand, which was tasty. Street performers were cool too.Just another place that's really nice to spend the day outside in Cali :)",Toni-ann C

50,Fun Street - Cool Shops,We visited in Wednesday August 20 and had a great time. The stores were amazing and it was clean and well kept. Loved going into the J. Crew Store and the Urban Outfitter was awesome as well. It was a fun afternoon and we will be back.,Janet H

50,Fun and interesting; every city should have a street like this,"We visited on Friday, August 29, 2014 in the evening.This street is blocked off on both ends to make it a pedestrian friendly walkway. It seems that they have themed weeks or weekends. On this night is was Pharaoh's Festival - Greek influences. Belly dancing, ethnic foods and ethnic hand made products for sale.Lots of street performers and fun things for the kids. Restaurants, stores and fun! Every city should have a street like this!",Steve0315
50,A day trip in heaven,A georgous closed off walking area filled with nice shopping and restaurants. Gets crowded on weekend but what doesn't if its any good. Not needed on every trip to Santa Monica but a nice change of pace.,BIGMIKE275
40,Getting a little tired but still handy to my hotel,Outdoor pedestrian malls will almost always get my vote but it seems to me that this one is getting a little tired. I did snag a great little poncho at the The Old Navy so it's certainly worth the time to go there. But there are probably better places to eat and some of the 'ambiance' could be improved - although it might just be the time of year. I was there in late August in the middle of the day.,silvergypsy45

They even have public restrooms that have a visitor center type desk that is maned until late in the night. The parking is very affordable in the garages. We'll be back!*hint* If you don't mind the walk you can walk over a few blocks and look over the ocean. There is a nice green park above PCH that looks down on the beach / ocean. You can't walk to the ocean from here easily but it's a nice view at sunset.Please give me a helpful vote if you enjoyed my review. Thanks for reading!",Erika S
50,Enjoyable!!,"We shopped at the Promenade during our visit to the Pier and also Venice Beach. A really neat area for shopping and eating. Two blocks or more of shopping that is completely closed off to traffic. If you are in the area, this is a place that you will want to see.",Kay S

40,Love wandering the shops and checking out the people and street performers,"The promenade is a fun place to wander, and there are performers of all ilks - gymnasts, rappers, dog trainers, Andean flute players... every day is different. Many good deals can be found at the local albeit mostly corporate stores, and there are some tasty food options - try the fast food place Greek on the East side in a small food court. It is delicious, buffet style and cheap!",maracujagirl
40,It is so close to the hotel,"It was brilliant. Very clean city. Very handy to the hotel. I cannot comment any negativity. We visited Santa Monica when the weather was at its best and took advantage of this. People were very friendly and always welling to help with queries on where to find places. There is also the poor that seems to linger down by the beach. When they spoke with us, there were some of them that seem to have hope clutching their bibles. Does the govt help them in anyway? We would love to visit again and travel around your country. Many thanks for making our stay stress less.",Sandra N

That is because if you have any interest in shopping, dining, or just killing time and maybe seeing a movie, this is really a great place to do it. (Initially four stars, because, well, it is just a mall when it comes down to it.) The street performers add to the ambiance of the place; between them and the location near the beach in the perfect weather of Santa Monica, it would be tough for any outdoor mall in the USA to be any better. That said, we just walked through quickly to look around and grabbed a snack before we headed to the beach.",Jon P

40,Lots of shops and restaurants,"The Promenade is a short walking distance from the Santa Monica Pier. So after walking the Pier, we walked the Promenade too.

40,Great for shoppers,"If you enjoy shopping you'll love this precinct, which is dominated by a giant Bloomingdales store. There are also numerous restaurants and specialty stores that give the promenade a village-like feel.

We even found a massive Barnes and Noble store where we browsed the latest best sellers and hunted down some magazines.",Kathy S

40,So SoCal Outdoor Shopping Street,"The shopping here is very upscale and/or youth-oriented, but it is worth a stroll if you are in the area to see some of the Art Deco buildings and enjoy the ambiance of outdoor seating. The large topiary dinosaurs are surprising but will delight children, and the street performers add to a pleasant day or an evening carnival atmosphere. On the weekday I visited, the area was clean and calm--not rowdy like Venice Beach. There is a well-stocked Barnes and Noble bookstore if you are inclined to brouse.",Susanwt

So, you can easily walk 3rd St, have lunch, then head to the beach and enjoy!Parking is always a challenge. But, we found a great parking garage on 4th St between Wilshire and Arizona. It's reasonable and what's great is you can start your walk just a block away on 3rd St at Wilshire (basically where the promenade ends) and walk along 3rd St and you won't miss anything!",ChristineH

It is probably best from early afternoon into the evening. Aside from the plethora of stores and street kiosks you will find ample street entertainment and people watching. There are movie theaters and many restaurants and coffee spots. Many of them are chains and moderate priced. You are also only a few blocks walk to Ocean Avenue for more upscale dining.

40,Great Late Night Adventure,"While I wouldn't go spending the day here, as it mainly consists of a combination of stores, chain food places, and restaurants, it is a great place to head to around dusk.My brother, a friend, and myself headed here around dinner time, ate, and watched the place come to life. Dozens of local musical artists set up in the middle of the promenade and play. Hundreds of people roam the long stretch shopping, eating, or just hanging out. Great night life once it is dark. And me personally being a car guy, it was a bit of a surprise and a good one at that to see the Tesla Showroom.Tips:- Go in the evening, when music is playing, and the night life is out- Do not fear the homeless people. While there are more than I was expecting in the area, they don't bother you. There are plenty of police in the area and not once did i encounter or see an issue with them- Look for the deals, prices at the restaurants and bars can get expensive, but some of the more local places have great deals.",Alex S

40,fun if you like shopping,"This place is great if you like shopping and walking. There are dozens of shops that line both sides of the street. The center part of the street is set up for people to walk. No cars are allowed in this area. There are often musicians, actors, singers, and other people trying to earn tips. This makes for an interesting time if you like to watch people.I have personally seen:1. Acrobatic group - these guys dance (break dance), do back flips, etc...2. Singers - Any number of singers have been here when I have frequented the place. Classical, jazz, country, rock, etc....3. Actors - There have been many actors, mimes,4. Special Acts5. Religious groups - this has become a place for public expression of belief, so there are many religious groups that do express their views in this forum.There is a large Apple store here that is fun to visit.There are also two theaters here. I can't tell if they are connected. When you google them, both come up... AMC on the corner, usually has the more up to date movies. The theater in the center of the promenade may have more esoteric films or older films. This theater is not that nice...There is no shortage of restaurants within walking distance of this area.",J S

However, there is enough stuff going on that it's worth checking out.

Very nice area to stroll about with the cool breeze off the beach making even a sunny Summer day a very comfortable walk. Really liked the whole vibe of the area, just wish we weren't on a tight schedule when we visited so we could have bought a pint and watched the World Cup match that was showing in several fun pubs we passed.",txyz
30,Ever been to a Mall?,"Well, this is an outdoor mall - with entertainment in the middle. If you want to shop, amongst many tourists and have a fair meal - come here. Otherwise...you came all the way to California - go somewhere else.",bckathleen1982
50,Fun on the promenade,"Looking for food, drinks or just casual walking about (not to be confused with the walkabout). Good place. A couple of theaters, lots of food, street musicians. You name it",Barry S
50,"Great place for shopping, eating, drinking, & people-watching",We went to Santa Monica in May for our wedding anniversary. We loved walking up & down the Third Street Promenade. There were ample choices of restaurants and bars to choose from. Lots of street performers to enjoy. It should not be missed if you are ever in the Santa Monica Area!,I4761TYsusanb
30,Very touristy/chain stores/crowded,This street has very little in the way of originality. It is basically a mall that is laid out across several streets. They have all the major chain stores. There are street performers (watch your wallet) and mostly tourist. There are no views while you are shopping and I have never understood what attracts people to this area. There are a lot of restaurants but none as good as others you could find close by without enduring the crowds.,travelingworkingmom
50,Love Santa Monica!,"This is our go-to place when we're out of ""what to do"" ideas. People gazing, shopping and the beach....all in one place!",Teresa H
50,Something New To See Every Time,"We stroll 3rd Street every time we're in the LA area. I always stop in the Apple Store, and it's fun to explore all the shops. There's always a great movie showing in one of the theatres--we took in Jersey Boys this time. Fun stop!!",cynsha
50,Great addition to our LA trip,"Third Steer Promenade was a highlight of our trips. With outside dining and stores, it was the perfect place to relax in the evening.",Daniel A
30,Just another Mall area,This isn't a great area to shop or eat really. It is just average. There are no stores that are out of the ordinary and you are much better off doing your shopping elsewhere in LA.,Sydneyside
30,Overrated…,I’m trying to figure out why this is so popular. I stopped here for the first time and it was loaded with homeless people and street musicians. The large Forever 21 and H & M were great but definitely not worth an out of the way trip. Parking was reasonable. 90 minutes free and $1.50 per half hour with a $14 daily max – there is no validating. You’d pay way more in San Diego or LA. But really? Not that great.,riceburnergrace
30,Overrated,Third St Prom Street acts seemed all too complacent for my liking. Seems that all you need to do is turn up to turn a buck. Not much real talent or enthusiasm witnessed when we went. An overtired spectacle in my view.,Ritzy12
50,Promenade Parade,"We visited the Promenade in the evening and were happy we did because there were so many people out and about shopping, eating and enjoying the impromptu entertainment. Worth the visit.",Cheryl D

50,Pedestrian Mecca,"Just a few minutes’ walk from the beach, this is a mecca for shoppers. The street is closed to traffic for some blocks – except for cross traffic on the east-west avenues of course, and boasts myriad shops, bars, boutiques and restaurants. There are multistory parking lots adjacent to the shops. Fancy topiary and statues along the median make for color and visual esthetics. Baskers provide background music and entertainment. One singer was so great we bought a CD off him. Whatever you might be shopping for, you’ll find it here.",Esty666
50,Shopping,Must see if you have time and like to shop or have teenagers. Pay for parking a few blocks away. Take pictures.,David W
10,"Anywhere, USA","The Third Street Promenade was once a quirky montage of old standards (Woolworth's, JC Penney) and outstanding originals (Midnight Special Bookstore). Now it's a theme park without the rides, an unimaginative money trap populated by the same shops you'll find at the Grove, Universal City Walk or any big city mall. As an alternative, wander down Santa Monica's Main Street in Ocean Park. Though it too is succumbing to chain store syndrome, there are still some independent shops and restaurants worth a visit.",VagabondKatt
50,Post sun shop,"Good selection of stores, great places to grab a bite, good buskers playing, and an easy walk from area hotels.",CameraOn
50,So Much Fun!,"The third street promenade is lots of fun for pedestrians, shoppers, eaters, musicians, people-watchers and all-around tourists. It's quite long and there are multiple musicians along the street, each with their own brand of music, none of which bother the other. There are restaurants and shops and just a wonderful, safe place to visit. There is a parking garage off of 2nd and Arizona St. and if you still have energy after the promenade, go on down to the Santa Monica beach, the pier....it's endless fun!",lindawJ811LW
10,SO Disappointed!,"This place is nothing but an outside shopping mall! There's nothing quirky or special about it except the rude, masses of people running into you to get to the next store!My advise: head to The Grove.....much more fun!",mom-2-4boyz

Plenty to gawk at.",anamshaz
30,Overrated!,"Never having conducted a search of local activities and landmarks, I recently googled LA's top attractions and was astounded to find the Third Street Promenade as a top listing. I don't feel that this destination is a poor choice, but if you are from out of town with only a few days to visit, then I would exclude this from the itinerary. The legitimate attraction within walking distance is the Santa Monica Pier, offering Americana and fun. (And you could still venture to the Third Street Promenade to judge it yourself.)Otherwise, if your mission is the eccentric street performer experience, you might as well venture down to Venice Beach. If you seek an outdoor shopping and dining romp, then I would recommend downtown Pasadena instead.",humu1
50,Very good for both shopping & dining,Excellent local & very modern shopping mall. Lots of dining around also. Could not fault. We also found a Sears store nearby which had a sale so a bonus!,evieroselily

40,Great people watching!,"Wonderful outdoor pedestrian ""mall"" in a nice area. Weekend evenings are the best time to visit, as the variety of street performers is great.

But it still has some redeeming qualities.While I hardly find a shop on the promenade that is NOT a big box store, I mean who could pay the rent here?, It is still good for shopping, pick up a bite or a movie and great for people watching.Close to the beach so that it has a nice cool feel in the warm weather.",Shana S

40,Like an outdoor mall,Has all the shops & more in an outdoor set-up. Kinda felt like a European shopping street. Some good restaurants - along with all the usual fast food options.

40,Cool Promenade,"Since we dont have Promenades like this where i'm from, I was pretty much blown away.The place is super clean, there's no smoking allowed and police tries to keep the homeless people away as much as possible.You have tons of shops and little stands where you can buy stuff, a couple of restaurants and some interesting artists and street performers from time to time. Plus when you walk the promenade all the way to the end you'll get to the 3rd Street Mall which is one of the best looking malls in states.Also on Thursdays (?) you have the farmers market on the promenade which is also pretty neat.Overall it's a great place to go. My suggestion, go in the afternoon, do some shopping or just people watching, get a drink or bite in one of the restaurants and finish the night in the movie theater which is also on the promenade.",Norm T
50,Near the Santa Monica Pier,"3rd street Promenade in Santa Monica was a walk away from the Pier, all in all a wonderful end to the day.

I returned last week after a 22 year absence to see that not much had changed, although the area seemed to be dirtier and in need of street-sweeping and cleaning.

A couple of really fine street musicians were heating up the atmosphere with tunes and that added to the great mood. Everywhere you look are unusual and amusing sculptures...from the large metal foliage draped water-spewing dragons down the centre of the promenade to whimsical sculptural tributes on the sidewalks. No shortage of shopping at the high end or just plain interesting gear. Great place to sit and people watch too. Spent the better part of an afternoon there and would do the same again.

During a 3 month period I found completely diffenent boots in the same store in NYC and the Promenade. This store explained that as shoppers travel into one of their same stores even in LA, the boots and shoes will have a more urban, sophisticated look rather than the casual beachy look found Santa Monica.Overall, this is a great area to shop on a sunny day at the Promenade. Very relaxing, great stores, shops, restaurants. Close, easy parking at the Santa Monica Place Mall parking garage adjacent to the Promenade. Multi-level parking garage with rooftop food court!",RikiUSA

50,"Nice mixture of street, stores, garden and people","One can't visit Santa Monica without going to Third Street Promenade. It's a combination of good stores, some performers (if you go there during Sunday), many people walking around and a small garden usually with some flowers on it. Those who love Apple stuffs can find a nice brunch there too.",Ritadecassiagarcia

50,Super cool shopping,"Santa Monica's shopping mecca is just amazing! A great selection of stores including the most amazing Barnes and Noble I've ever been to.

40,pedestrian shopping street in LA,"This small pedestrian shopping area is a welcome oasis in busy, urbanized LA. Aside from the multitude of shops and cafes lining the promenade, there are street performers that add to the festive atmosphere of the place. It is relaxing to spend an hour or two just strolling around and browsing in the shops.",Cutie888
20,Disappointed in Changes,"I used to spend quite a bit of time at the Third Street Promenade, but was disappointed recently. Many of the shops are gone, there were more vendor carts before...and now, a block or so off the Promenade, the Tudor House tea room, which was a typically British tea room and the best thing about the area, is gone. Just not what it used to be.",portergirlbooks
40,LA 2014,Another great people watching place. Many affluent shops. Pubs and restaurants. Lively street performers entertain throughout the day and into the evenings. Lots to do.,J G
30,3rd Street Promenade,"Was disappointed in this area because the shops are all big name stores and I was expecting more artsy, locally owned stores and boutiques. It was like going to an outside mall of big name store chains. The had kiosks in the street just like a big mall and the same kind of stuff. Very disappointing in that respect. They do have some interesting looking places to eat so it might be a nice place for dinner but not for shopping.",James G
30,Lots of choices that can be found anywhere,"The good news is the promenade is in a gorgeous area. Fantastic weather is always on tap. And there is free 90 minute parking provided by the City of Santa Monica up to pm everyday which is almost solely responsible for the 3 stars. The bad news is plentiful. While there are a lot of stores of course, they are all places that can be found in any mall across America. The promenade is also extremely crowded most nights and weekends. You will also be panhandled quite a bit so be prepared for that. Do yourself a favor and take advantage of the free parking to enjoy the sunset and use the side streets to avoid the crowds.",Noah S
40,Great vibe,"Didn't really know about it and stumbled across it in our walks. Great street appeal, plenty of shopping if youre into that and some fabulous eateries off it.",Julie L
30,Nice place to walk,Nice selection of stores to shop in while walking outside. There aren't many restaurants along this section. There's a farmers market at the end but everyone was packed and ready to go about 12:30.,JMRow
40,Nice walk around area,This promenade in Santa Monica has a lot of nice stores to visit for shopping. It was very cool to visit the Tesla store - very cool car.The promenade is very cool designed and have a lot restaurants to visit.,Mads
40,Nice location and shops.,"If you live or love Santa Monica, then you've likely been here a number of times. While the current stores are nice, I do miss a number of places that used to be there over the years and have since closed. One of my favorites was Broadway Deli, which had such a great selection of Salmon and used fresh tuna in their sandwiches. There are still a lot of great places to go to. If you want to casually shoot pool, there is a Yankee Doodle. The Puzzle Zoo has a great selection of toys. There are a ton of clothing stores and restaurants. They used to have a mall at the 3rd and Santa Monica intersection, but that was torn down and revamped into a new outdoor, two story area.",Laura B
50,Great local mall.,This street is really pedestrian friendly and has just about every shop you could think of. Has heaps of buskers and was full of life and people when we visited.,415GerardC
40,Fun afternoon walking around here,The shopping is pretty good but I had more fun watching the street entertainers. Some were really talented and entertaining. Really fun way to spend an afternoon!,TDakin
40,"Not the shopping, but the street shows are fun","Third street promenade had a great vibe. The shopping was average, mostly expensive. There was a lovely two story book store located in the middle. A bunch of fancy restaurants, at the same time you have the quick and cheap food available as well. The best the promenade has to offer is the street shows, quite some talent there. You have great guitarists, dancers, and of course the legendary tin man/robot guy.",Kallau R
30,Average shopping experience,Good in that it is a pedestrian street and so you can amble along with safety. Not a great variety in shops or restaurants. From what i saw in Los Angeles it is good but compared to other cities in the world very average.There was one site for a street performer when I was there and sometimes someone good would be playing.but not the variety of street performers seen in many other cities.,highst25
50,Fun stroll,"Nice to not have to deal with traffic while on a stroll along the shops. Some good restaurants, eclectic mix of shops with the big mall at one end. Love that much of the original architecture was preserved.",kellypea56
40,The Heart and Soul of Downtown Santa Monica,"Let's get this out of the way: yes, it's touristy. Yes, it can be super-crowded. Yes, you should absolutely come on a weekday if you can (unless you actually enjoy the atmosphere when there are big crowds, in which case, sunny Saturdays on the Promenade are for you!)I used to live in Santa Monica, and while many locals shun the Promenade, I always enjoyed it. It is the heart and soul of the downtown area, with most of the chain stores you could possibly want to shop at, near-constant live music and entertainment, a fairly decent selection of food options, and of course, dinosaur-shaped bushes. What doesn't say heart and soul if not dinosaur-shaped bushes?It's a great place to go if you need to get some shopping done and want to do so in the sunshine or before/after a trip to the beach, since it's only three blocks from the ocean. If you can, I also recommend the Watson Adventures scavenger hunt that takes you all around the promenade and Santa Monica pier as a fun way to get to know the area.",sokarys
50,A shoppers paradise,Great shops and wonderful atmosphere busy with people and street entertainers. Also several good restaurants. Try Monsieur Marcel for lunch -good location and reasonably priced.,CEMARMITAGE
30,Just okay,I think this is a hyped area. There are a lot of street acts going on which are entertaining. Restaurants pick carefully as we visited several different ones and were not impressed go to The Lobster or Blue Plate Taco. Lots of shops but same thing you can go to at any decent mall. If celebs are lonely you may spot one or two here to be seen but usually it's so crowded unless you visit during the week. Fun to go once but.unless shopping is your thing once is enough!,Bankerchic77

50,The best mall in the USA,"In my opinion for offering, setting, weather, proximity to the sea, food, it is the best mall in the USA.",Pellavan
50,Top notch street perfomers,"On this pedestrians only (!!!) promenade you must take your time to walk up and down. I have never seen so much talent and entermaint in one place. You'll see singers, dancers, musicians and many other categories of street perfomers. Most of them are very talented (some just a little less). Just pick out the performances and be amazed or just have a good laugh. But whatever you do, don't go to fast or you'll miss out on the good stuff.Also you'll find some very nice shops if you're into that.",Roel J
50,Always fun,We like to come to the 3rd St Promenade every time we are in town. Great mix of stores and you just can't beat the people watching. One of our favorite teen/womens' stores is there and we found so many cute things. Plenty of places to get a meal or a treat. On a nice day- a great way to spend an hour or two!,bloomcrew
40,Great place to walk/shop/eat,Took a day trip to Santa Monica with my husband and 12yr old son. Parking can be a bit stressful but we found a parking garage on the next street over at a decent price. Lots of stores to shop and cool stuff sold by vendors up and down the walkway. Tons of places to eat too. Fun to watch the street performers as well...overall a good place to check out when in Santa Monica :),FranzenRN

40,A nice interesting evening walk,"We visited the promenade on a pleasant Sunday evening in September. There were plenty of, and a variety places to eat. The promenade was a great place to people watch, with street performers on every block. Some were very talented and others just unique or funny. We walked to the Santa Monica Pier before visiting the promenade. Everything is within a short walking distance.",HunkyJoe

This is an interesting people watching area.We visited two different evenings.Walk here after a visit to the Santa Monica Pier .",Stategt
40,A pleasant diversion,"Santa Monica has successfully rekindled the downtown experience on the Third Street Promenade. This pedestrian friendly outdoor mall has numerous dining and shopping options with the people watching and street performers making the visit more enjoyable. Multistory parking off 4th and Lincoln offers free parking for the first 90 minutes, but you'll need much longer to fully explore the area.",KLE2013

40,Our day shopping in Santa Monica,Nice Restaurants and a great Selection of Retailers. It has really changed for the better! We used to live nearby and haven't been back in over a decade. Happy to see the progress firsthand!,JDPMiami
40,Great higher-end shopping with typical store options,"Third Street Promenade is a great place to check out some brand-specific stores. The outdoor mall is very clean, with many of the typical, higher-end offerings (Apple, PacSun, Sketchers, etc.) Because you're in LA, the stores will include flagship-type products that may not be found at other locations. For example, the Dr. Martin store had a selection of vegan shoes that are probably only available online and at a few stores. There are also a lot of great restaurants nearby.",50DaysofBoarding
50,Excellent Shopping,Great for shopping and restaurants. It's the reason why I stay in Santa Monica and not Hollywood or LA.,Retrokittykat

50,Best thing to ever happen to Santa Monica,"In a busy city, it's nice to be able to find a place that's a bit more relaxed, a pedestrian thoroughfare with small shops, street performers and best of all... no smoking (strictly enforced, even though the promenade is out of doors). This is a great place to bring the kids or come with a date. Restaurants abound, along with pubs, bars and specialty shops, and your usual chains—Hooters, Starbucks, a new and improved Apple Store, Victoria's Secret, Pinkberry, Abercrombie and Fitch, plus several movie theaters... all on three vehicle-free blocks that face the massive Santa Monica Place Mall (featuring even more shopping and eating establishments).",Barry G
40,great ambience,"3rd Street is a fun place to take your family or a date for some casual shopping or eating, but there's also live entertainment that includes talented musicians, dancing, and acrobatics. My dad plays guitar for one of the singers occasionally and has a blast, especially when the audience grows and really gets into the music. The place has a cozy feel at nighttime with all the twinkle lights everywhere. I like to go every time I visit LA.",ajenshus
50,Nice shopping,"For shopping i can higly recommend Third Street Promenade in Santa Monica. Great stores, laid back atmosphere and not that crowdy. Easy and cheap to park your car in one of the parking garages close by",Yava1983
40,Great place to browse and eat,"I grew up in Santa Monica and coming to the promenade was what my friends and I did every Friday and Saturday night throughout high school. It is great to hang around if you want to to eat, see a movie and do a bit of shopping. Unfortunately, it has changed so much since I was in high school. Many of the shops and restaurants I grew up with have shut down over the years and it has become pretty unfamiliar. I do still enjoy walking down the few blocks that make up the promenade and watching the street performers. I am actually going to be meeting a friend there today. If you are in the area I do recommend at least taking a look especially since it is right next to the mall and pier.",lifeisapancake

40,"Love it or hate it, one of the best chain store shopping spots in LA","The immediate critique most have of 3rd Street is that it's almost entirely chain stores you can get in any major city, including in the rest of LA. Well folks, it is the beach, rent is high, so that is what you get.It is fantastic for what it is, and has more chain stores than any other shopping district in Los Angeles considering you have the newly renovated Santa Monica Place right there as well. These are the best versions of all the chain stores, many are super sized versions of them and all are perfectly organized and have attentive staff if you need help. No pushy sales people with the exception of Lush in my experience (they follow you and won't stop the conversation, I had to be very direct).",OrchidGardener

40,Attractive Area with Shopping and Restaurants,"The Third Street Promenade is a pedestrian-only areas that is located along 3rd Street near Wilshire. There are several restaurants available as well as many shops. We ate at two restaurants and both were very good. The area is well-maintained and cleanly. We went there in the morning on one day and they were washing the streets, which is something I assume they do on a daily basis considering how cleanly the area was. There are many entertainers in the area during the day and night, though there were there during the night. All of the entertainers we saw were musicians and singers.If you are in the area visiting the Santa Monica Pier or beach, it is worth a visit. I wouldn't go out of my way to drive there.",Shannon K

It's about a 4-5 block of walking.Parking was easy. There are quite a few parking structures right in the area...didn't have to walk far. And parking fee wasn't that expensive. We only stayed about 2 hours.",elly3
30,good shopping,Bought two beautiful pairs of boots there - probably could not find similar styles in VA where I live. Promenade was jam packed - why people are not on the beach is beyond me.,Cari D
50,Amazing,"Love it here. the place comes to life at night. great steet acts, restaurants, bars and of course shops.",Jennifer R
40,Good place to eat and just hang out,"The promenade has everything: food, shopping, street performers, coffee, movies and more. You can have a really nice or really casual meal and hang out for the night. It's definitely a place to go to kill some time. New parking garages are surprisingly cheap.",musclegirl68
30,great for people watching,"Lots of bars and resturants, nothing so special in the way of shopping, but a selection of national and local shopsIn the evening a lot of street entertainers, also there are ""helpers"" wandering around to make sure you find what you needWorth a visit while in Santa Monica",Ascot_Flyer
30,Third Street/Farmers Market,This is a great shopping centre but beware the parking charges are exorbitant. We failed to get our ticket validated and was charged $10. We went to the cinema the next day and because we parked in the wrong car park we were charged a massive $24 dollars. They take advantage of the fact that you do not know where to park or what to do and rip you off. Not happy at all about the parking charges when we spent money there.,Karen H
30,Good if you are bored,"If you are not from Los Angeles, this isn't anything special. If you are from Los Angeles, go if you are bored. There are shops and restaurants along the streets, and performers at night. It is just a retail-friendly area to help stores thrive and gather a crowd. Nothing special. I try to avoid it if I can and only go if someone invites me or that is where a get-together will be.",Kelly A
40,Lots and lots of people,"The street is an open mall. You can find many brands and restaurants in the area.Usually its incredibly crowded, especially on weekends.",ragdias
40,So LA!,Good collection of shops for everyone to enjoy and wonderful restaurants up and down the strip. Plenty of street artists trying to catch their big break and also plenty of homeless (harmless) people. The homeless tend to leave you alone unlike San Fran and NY.,InMelbWeTrust
40,What a great place to wander...,"Santa Monica is an amazing place in general, but I know from a friend who has lived there for years that it has not always been that way. No, in the 70s and 80s it was kind of rundown. The pier was a mess and the downtown didn't thrive like today. So good planning was what turned it around, and the Third Street Promenade was a central factor in that revitalization. My first visit there was with my friend, who showed me around with a kind of parental pride in the creation they had made. And it IS beautiful and IS a happy place! I have been back many times and it is just ""good vibrations"" always! However, I gave it 4 rather than 5 for one reason....it lacks a drugstore or a ""general"" store...an easy place to get a bottle of water or sunscreen, and that has always bugged me. Sooo, if you are listening Santa Monica, how about a CVS?? Otherwise, it is great fun...enjoy!",mvlNewHampshire
40,Very nice way to spend some time shopping,"This was a very nice way to spend some time window shopping. There are some great places to stop for coffee and a snack or a full meal, dining al fresco and watching the street performers and the tourists.",spudcatCentralCove

And all the shops you want to find are somewhere in the few blocks that are here. I also loved the restaurants, such as a raw food restaurant a block away.

On a sunny day, strolling the street and poking into stores is great fun. If you go on a Wednesday, you'll find the Arizona Street farmer's market open.

40,NOT FAR FROM SANTA MONICA PIER,"If you are going to Santa Monica Pier, make the effort to walk another three blocks to Third Street Promenade for a look. There were a variety of well known shops and it was in a pleasant area and the shop assistants were all friendly and welcoming.

50,So much to see,"We're not big mall shoppers, but took the grandkids shopping and had a great time! So many stores, it was so much fun just window shopping! Had a quick lunch but had such a great time window shopping that we stayed and had dinner there too. Food was great, and we decided to walk off some of the extra weight, but found our way to some delicious ice cream, while we listened to some wonderful music. It was a great time for all of us - no matter what the age!",2x2ontheroad4u
50,Easy outing with friends or alone,"Every time I get guests in L.A. from Europe I make sure to take them to / or recommend to them to go to 3rd Street Promenade in Santa Monica near the beach.

You can listen to the live music being performed, have ice cream, catch a movie and combine the whole thing with a visit of Muscle Beach in Venice etc. Enjoy!!",Skinmeister

50,If You Love Shopping,Third Street promenade Santa Monica is def one of my favourite places to shop. I have been to Cali two times now and been all over and Santa Monica was just a really nice place to shop. Its calm and there is alot of variety but not too much so you don't get overwhelmed and after a day of shopping you can relax at the each a perfect day :),Maz825
40,Nice outdoor stroll but typical mall stores,A nice place to take a stroll. Street performers run the gamut from good to bad. Fun to people watch in the early evening.,jegnm

40,Lots of restaurants and expensive shops. Many frstivals and entertainment by street performers.,was there for Labor day long weekend and it was extremely crowded.Too hard to get into a restaurant look for any just off this area and they are cheaper.,Vicki J
40,Pleasant Walk,"The Promenade is very pleasant and fun for the walk and great weather. Most of the stores, however, are very typical mall stores, although the Apple Store is gorgeous and there is a Tesla showroom.",bfhc
40,Sales tax is higher than rest of L.A.,"Really pleasant place to shop along an outdoor pedestrianised street. Chain stores, not independant shops though. If you are shopping for big ticket items such as Apple products, and the sales tax percentage will make a difference, be aware that the tax in Santa Monica is slightly higher than rest of city and the entire country. I got stung bigtime! Go there for lunch and some retail therapy.",Christine L

Everything you could want in the way of food, shopping, and entertainment all on one street. Bring your walking shoes because it's a long street and you don't want to miss any of it.",cooldoggirl
30,Like a traveling gypsy caravan,"On the plus side, the Third Street Promenade has wonderful metal sculptures of dinosaurs, covered in jasmine, which blooms in season. There are many small kiosks, selling everything from i-phone covers to plastic lamp shades. But mainly, you see street performers (some good, so not so much) ranging from Bolivian flute players to belly dancers to skateboarding dogs and balloon makers, all looking for tips. Noisy and crowded, but can be fun for a short visit. We pass through this stuff to get to our restaurant.",Ambersea
40,Makes a nice difference to shopping Malls.,"A nice place to go shopping, its slightly boring during the daytime as there are only a few other shoppers, so one often finds the shop assistants gathering round watching your every move.However there is a good range of shops and they stay open late in the evening which in my opinion is the best time to shop here. There are far more people and a few street performers, although I can't stand these loosers they do add to the atmosphere.",L13Y
40,Good fun,"3rd St is a touch too tourist like but good fun and has all you need. Plenty of shops, bars and the like in a nice pedestrian area.",smedley26
40,Shopping Galore,Lots of variety of shops although seems to be a lack of childrens shop. Need a bit of cash to splash in these shops but bargins can be found,Sundial040
40,"Street Performers, Musicians but lots of people","Is this a tourist trap? Absolutely! However, if you visiting you have to the Third Street Promenade and Santa Monica Pier at the same time. Parking and Traffic will be a problem but these two places are landmarks and you get to watch all the starving entertainers, musicians and etc. One guy does nothing but backflips; it is funny watching him. There are plenty of places to eat, shop and even movies. You have everything here from Hooters to AMC Movies to Bloomingdales to a place called True Food Kitchen. There are many photo ops here. Save your money don't spend too much. Remember everything is ""on sale"". Again, this is your normal typical shopping place but the street performers trying to collect some money from spectators similar to New Orleans makes his an interesting stop. Many tourist here from all over the world. I would recommend using the bus if you have time. Warning this is SOCAL so you will see everything here be warned!",jdreynoldsjr
50,Lively place in Santa Monica,Great place to hang out and relax. Lot of street entertainment and beautiful view of the ocean. Great selection of restaurants. Santa Monica pier has lot of activities for kids. Some great shops located in this area including Apple Store.,ksrajiv

50,The Perfect Escape,"The Promenade has a little bit of everything, from high-end to economic stores. I love Desiduals, clothes that are based on Cirque du Soliel designs, but it's a very expensive place to shop. I find myself at Forever 21 a lot and can pick up some really good bargains there. There are good street musicians worth stopping to listen to, and there are lovely little bistros in the center of the street where you can relax with a glass of wine and light snacks before hitting the stores again. There are also several theatres on the Promenade that show 1st-run movies. So much to do, so little time.",Karen G
50,Amazing!,I had a wonderful vacation in California that consisted of much shopping and dining. The third street promenade is long and filled with many stores as well as entertainment as you walk.,Cheerboy101

40,"Just Shopping street, can spend a few hours, hard to find parking sometimes","3rd Street promenade is just shopping street. It stretches for 4-5 blocks with stores some chain some local, If you are not a big shopper you can take a stroll or just look at the people, which can make it really interesting to just walk or seat and look at some California nuts. There are quite a few Street performers entertaining you as you walk. Some are good some are bad. Lots of homeless also here. Also performing singing or just begging. I guess you find lots of Homeless in Santa Monica. I guess it is a good place to take a stroll, do some people watching, shopping if you like or just to kill some time. There are quiet a few restaurants, but all pricey and nothing to memorable. If you do not want to spend to much money you can go to the food court of the Santa Monica Place. Promenade ends at the Santa Monica Place. Newly renovated outdoor mall. A few good stores on this place like Nordstrom and Bloomingdale'sI would say an OK tourist Stop. Not bad but nothing extraordinary.tip:It is a little difficult to find parking on the weekends. If you try to park on the Santa Monica place parking lot, enter the parking structure on Colorado Ave. If I recall correctly, If you are getting off on 4th street from 10fwy Westbound make a right then a left on Colorado Ave. The parking structure will be on your right",ericucho n
50,For the passionate spectator,"If you like crowds and enjoy people-watching - what has been called ""the gastronomy of the eye"" - this is an urban explorer's heaven. And because it's in the heart of Santa Monica it's perfectly safe. Oddballs and cranks and a few crazies, yes, but it's fun and there is plenty for the kids to enjoy.Mornings and afternoons on the Promenade are pretty sleepy, arrive after 7:00 and the place is buzzing.",zadkine

40,A European feel,"Although you'll find most of the shops in any city, it's the fact that all these shops are located on the Promenade or on one of the side-streets. The only time that you'll have to look out for traffic is when you've got to cross one of the 3 Avenues with at times heavy traffic. The promenade itself is a delight. You can sit down and do some people watching or stroll and enjoy some of the street performers, some are pretty good.",Li_Isings
40,"A Nice Place to walk, bike, and stroll","This Third Street Promenade is so long and big that you won't feel as crowded like the Santa Monica Pier. A very nice place to walk, stroll, or bike on a beautiful evening in Santa Monica. A must-visit in Santa Monica.",2CanadianTravellers
40,Nice walk,"Undoubtedly in my opinion the highlight of Santa Monica, this area seems more befitting of the location compared to the outdated shabbiness of the Pier.The Promenade is clean, wide and has room for all, even on the busiest days, whilst the boutique array would keep any shopaholic happy. Restaurants and cares abound, making the whole experience very enjoyable.",Richard N
30,Nice time to waste a couple hours,"You walk around to browse small shops. These are not local shops but shops you would see at a mall. From Foot Action to Quiksilver. A wide variety of restaurants. From local mom and pop restaurants to Chipolte. Street performers entertain you as you walk. It is much like the walks in Hyannis or Cape May but more commercial and less local. Fun to just walk around, get something to eat and then leave.",Josh L

40,Nice Shopping & restaurants,Great place to spend an afternoon or early evening. Really enjoyed the new TESLA store located on the Third Street Promenade and got to see these amazing electric cars up close.,lovesdogs101
40,A Fun Place to Visit,"This is the place where LA, Santa Monica residence and tourists are gathering for a fun time. The best attraction there are the street performers. You never know what you are going to watch, but it is always fun. The shops used to be unique once, but not anymore, the trendy brand name kind of stores took the place over. Plenty of restaurants on the Promenade, however, pricy because of the location. There are so many excellent restaurants in Santa Monica, you can do better going to eat somewhere else.Right near by is the new mall, which is a bit too modern to my taste. However, on the top floor, there are plenty of good restaurants, or you can just seat there and enjoy the views. There are plenty of seats that you can sit even without eating in any of the restaurants.Just continue to walk around Santa Monica, you will love the place.",Tirza_ha

30,"Tourist's dream, resident's nightmare","I've been a Santa Monica resident for over 10 years, I will NEVER go on the promenade Fri- Sun and most locals would agree with me. It's full and packed with tourists and pushy street performers on the weekend. It's nice and quiet during the week, which is so much better. However, if you're a tourist, you might want to experience it with the crowd since it is more exciting.There are tons of homeless on the promenade. Santa monica is also home for the homeless, but homeless are cut off at Wilshire Blvd where it turns into residential. The Apple store is nice here and the outdoor mall at the end of the trip is worth a visit.The restaurants on the strip all over priced. The only good one is Mistfits and Tender Greens. I would say come here to shop, but go eat somewhere else. Main Street in Santa monica south of Pico has better restaurants.",Cameron L

40,Good shopping with some acceptable restaurants,"I live in Santa Monica and still come to the Promenade to shop as there are some good stores here that are accessible. Parking is easy as there are public garages on both 2nd and 4th street that allow for 90 minutes free parking. The shops I frequent most when I come to the Promenade include the Apple Store, Sephora, American Eagle Outfitters, and Anthropology. The vibe of the Promenade is lively and doesn't seem overly run by tourists (except maybe at night). One restaurant that has been a fave in the past is Monsoon, on the north end of the Promenade. It has a mix of Asian foods, including sushi. Santa Monica Place is at the south end of the Promenade and has a number of stores that may be of interest, including Disney, Kitson and Nordstroms. The Promenade is apparently one of the most visited places in southern Cal; it's actually a pretty good place to shop as the locals often shop here. Of note on Wednesdays and Saturdays is the farmer's market that surrounds the Promenade during the morning. This is a good place to pick up some local produce.",Deborah W
30,Run of the Mill Shopping,I was hoping for more unique stores. Nordstrom is everywhere.Enjoyed the street musicians and the general cleanliness of the area.,J F
40,A great outdoor mall,The promenade has a great variety of shops and restaurants not to mention it is only a few blocks from the beach. You could easily lose a whole day waking from end to end and taking a stroll in the sand. The promenade is clean and the locals are friendly and it's fun to stop and watch the street performers.,Tori2885
40,"Great place to browse, shop and eat.","As part of our trip around LA and other parts of California, we spent a good few hours in the promenade and the newer shopping centre. The newer shopping mall has what you would expect in terms of the brand leading shops and a selection of restaurants and is quite contemporary in its feel. The pedestrianized promenade itself is more of an experience. With street performers and some interesting fashions on show. It is a great place to spend some time soaking up So Cal. Again there is an excellent range of shops. One shop that is globally known for its casual footwear offers customization for your sneakers. If you take the time to converse with the in-store designer you can get a pair of sneakers made to your own unique design; how cool?If you like shopping it is most definitely for you, if you don't like shopping it's not a bad place to go and simply soak up atmosphere for a while whilst the people with you that enjoy shopping have their fun!Have dropped by there twice in the last two years and would go again.",Iharper

It is always crowded. 3 blocks a way from the ocean. You'll find all types of stores; Apple store, Victoria Secret, Abercrombie, Gap, just to name a few. All the way on the south end of the mall, you'll find many brand shops such as Louis Vuitton, Coach, Tiffany as well. There are 2 great deapartment stores;Bloomingdaleas and Nordstrom. If you enjoy shopping, and watching street performers, you can easily spend a couple hours here in Santa Monica. Walking distance to the Santa Monica Pier. Enjoy shopping.",MiaPianist
50,Nice Shopping Area,Parking is difficult but nice area. The mall has all the major dept stores and a great variety of restaurants and specialty stores. The promenade stretches about 4-5 blocks. There are street performers and vendors. It is walking distance to the pier or boardwalk,haileythegolden
40,Nice place to chill out,"Though crowded, it was a nice area to walk, sit, relax and just watch people. Stores are same as most everywhere else but I wasn't there to shop so it was OK. I'd go back to people watch if I had the opportunity as the ambiance was enjoyable though crowded.",Deborah S
50,Great Shopping Experience,Entertainment on the streets while you walk along the street. Great Shops and Restaurants for everyone! It was quite enjoyable.,Joanne S
30,Tourist Spot,"Lots of great stores to visit in this closed to traffic pedestrian mall, but also lots of pan handlers. Parking is difficult even though there are public garages, they fill up fast and you could drive forever before finding a spot on the street. Visit the newly renovated Santa Monica Place for a more enjoyable shopping/strolling experience complete with ocean views.",eastcoastali
40,Nice shopping street,"Nice relaxing atmosphere and place to watch people. It's great that there are no cars rushing by, too bad you still have to cross a couple of busy streets to visit the whole promenade.",TravellingDutchie
50,Fantastic place for people watching!,"The Third Street Promenade in Santa Monica is vibrant and full of life! What a great place to take a stroll and people watch! But there are also great stores and restaurants. There are street performers on every block, some so talented, others not so much! We enjoyed our time there and it's a definite must see when in Santa Monica!",Josephine
50,Great Shopping--Fun Atmosphere,"There is something for everyone on Third Street. Our family enjoyed the street performers, as well as the range of ""high end"" to affordable shopping choices.",SabrinaC411
30,Sadly nothing special,"Like other reviewers I visited this place a number of years ago and remember a much more interesting and vibrant place.During this visit the shops are rather uninteresting, there were quite a few homeless people and surprisingly very few places to get a decent late breakfast. Other shoppers had clearly formed the same conclusion as we were all crammed into a very busy Starbucks.If you want a shopping experience I think you would be better off going to the Grove.",GeorgieA1
40,A Happy Street to Stroll,"A great place to visit in the evening. There are many great and varied street entertainers, most of very god quality. Great restaurants and shopping, too.",Sar182433
50,Shopping,Plenty of shopping and cafes down here. Parking a bit of a problem but buses are close by. Short walk to beach and promenade,Vicki C
40,Kill some time - little bit of everything,"Nice area blocked off from traffic. Stores are OK along the promenade. Park and walk 3rd. Mostly clothes stores and some small boutiques. Plenty of places to eat either light snack, ice cream, or full dinner. Street performers, some a lot better then others. Stop in the Tesla pop up - something different in a car.Some of the restaurants are just for tourists so pick carefully.At end of the street is a mall attachment with higher end dept stores: Bloomingdales, Nordstrums, and some high end specialty stores. Check out the upper level food area. Zengo's is a must try. Overall, you can loose a few hours walking through. People watching is always interesting here too!",Lou M
40,Shop/Eat/Be entertained,"Beautiful outdoor blocks of shopping, dining and entertainment, including very good street artists. It ends at a huge outdoor mall as well.",Tim F
40,Something for everyone,"Spent an afternoon here with the whole family (adults and teens). My kids favorite stores (Urban Outfitters, H&M, Old Navy, Cotton On, Madewell, Barnes and Noble) made for a good shopping experience for them. Lots of restaurants to choose from in a variety of cuisines and prices. The UK shop was quaint, expensive and fun. My daughter loved the international newsstand where she picked up some British magazines that she had been looking for. The only reason for the 4 star rating was an interesting experience at Barnes and Noble. I know that Santa Monica has a ban on plastic single use bags. But spending money in the previous named stores warranted a nice paper bag when we left. Not so in Barnes and Noble, when we checked out the clerk said ""would you like to add a paper bag for $.10?"". Ummmm, no, I'll just stuff these things in my purse, thank you.Still it was a fun experience and I would go back when in Santa Monica.",Redpatch7
30,Outdoor Mall,"We last visited Santa Monica 15+ years ago when the shops along this pedestian walk were an eclectic mix. Unfortunately, most of the shops have disappeared and have been replaced by what can be seen in any local upscale mall.",Eric K
40,Fun several hours,"Don't miss at night funand so many options.. Food and shopping, place free shows. Visit early if you want the outside seating spots",Sara H
40,"Beat the heat, walk the street!","If you don't mind crowds and want to get away from the heat in the valley, then the Third St. Promenade will surely beat the heat. Why and what is this street? Well, it is automobile free for about 3-4 short blocks. Stores aplenty and restaurants galore. It starts on one end by the new and improved outdoor mall which appears to be the ""in place"" and it is jammed on the week-ends. Mostly the under 35 crowd when last I was there. (6 months ago). Noisy and busy top of the stairs restaurants/bars but hey, it's California and everyone is dressed in jeans, shorts and sundresses!There are street entertainers, some of which are very good. There are the occasional musicians, and the rhyming magicians, dancers and singers and when the weather is getting a bit beachy chilly, it's okay to walk the streets without anyone thinking badly of you. Bring a sweatshirt or maybe a hoody as the night chill will make you glad you did.The Third Street Deli (if it is still there) has the best bakery and bread section to peruse while waiting for a table. You may want to buy a treat and walk down the street with a to-go cup of coffee.During the daytime, it's usually not as crowded as the evenings, but check to see the day set aside for the well known Farmers Market when growers set up stands one or two blocks west and there also, cars are kept away.It is a food and flower feast for the eyes. The colors of the fresh picked vegetables laid out are ""eye candy."" The flowers with both soft and vibrant colors can melt your heart and the entire area screams of nature. It's an exciting place to walk around. So much in fact that when you re-enter back onto the normal Promenade stretch, suddenly it is boring and drab. But at night, the lights are on and excitement is back but without food and flowers.Enjoy life and pretend that instead of living here, you are a tourist and get out your comfort zone (your pad) and go on a mini vacation by the beautiful sea place!.",385eileenz
50,Entertaining,Loved the fairy lights in trees at night very pretty. It has some good shopping there. Nice restaurants.,Sarah M
50,Mall,"Did you really come to California to go to a mall?Unless you are from Scandinavia this place has a pricetag that would drive most people to mid America.If its shopping you are after, try Abbott Kinney in Venice or Santee Alley in downtown LA.",Ron K
30,If you like to shop,"Nothing great, but it is a good way to pass some time. Just a bunch of shops, there were ok performers and there were some restaurants.",dlee1967
50,Open air mall by the beach,"The promenade is a unique LA experience - a pedestrian mall, steps from the beach and Santa Monica Pier, with a great selection of shops and restaurants. Part of what is so remarkable is it wasn't always so nice. Twenty years ago it was down right seedy, with more thrift stores than new brands and an anchor mall that was run down and depressing. Now that old mall is gone, replaced with a cheerful multilevel complex that makes great use of ocean views and outdoor spaces. The promenade can be rather crowded both with shoppers and street performers but that's part of what gives it it's character. Don't miss near by, the beautiful ocean side Palisades Park and the famous Santa Monica Pier - or at least the iconic arched sign that indicates the start of the Pier.",lwturner
50,A Must See in Santa Monica,A walking mall with great shops and restaurants. Go on Wednesday or Saturday morning to see the Farmer's Market set up adjacent to Third Street Promenade.,Redhead1566
30,Just shopping,"Don't expect that much from the Third Street Promenade. It is basically an open air mall. There are live performers (they usually aren't entirely 'live', having an amp and a soundtrack to back up their vocals) and also beggars singing (it is sometimes hard to tell the two apart) but for the most part it is all about shopping. Many of the stores are chains, though some, like Lush, are fun to visit. The new addition on the south end has 3 stories and includes a Disney store and many restaurants. The Brittania pub (on Santa Monica Ave just north of the mall, between 3rd & 4th street) is your best bet for a relaxing pint after your hectic shopping spree.",jdvanvalin
50,Shopper's Heaven,"The Promenade has just about every mid-range and upscale store you could ever want. There's even a Tesla dealership! There's also an Apple store, if you drink the Kool-Aid. Shoes, clothes, theaters and restaurants line the street, and since it's pedestrians only, you can really enjoy the walk. The food isn't that great, unless you go onto the more expensive rooftop restaurants at Santa Monica Place on the south end of the Promenade. Also at Santa Monica Place you will find Bloomingdale's and Nordstrom's. I am a local, and I frequently shop at the Promenade. Check it out for the people watching and street performers, if nothing else.",Suziselt
50,"Though touristy, it has some nice stores","I live around here and I go to the promenade like its my local mall. It has a nice selection of stores, and always be open to noticing that a lot aren't actually on 3rd. 2nd and 4th have a lot of great things to offer as well as the blocks on the perpendicular streets. I love going to see movies at the theater at Arizona, and Barney's Beanery is always a must! 3rd Street is also great for people watching!",nevinbleau
50,Typical SoCal,"If you're from out of state, and you want to observe all you've heard about California being the land of ""fruits and nuts"", just spend a few hours on the Promenade and you will see it's true. Can't think of a much better place to people-watch. Street performers of high quality and quirky. Also, the shopping is first rate-the new mall on the end of the street is high class with quality stores in a beautiful setting. Variety of foods offered is excellent-much better than one might predict for a touristy destination. It also has three movie theaters showing all the latest. can't imagine a trip to Santa Monica without a half day at the Promenade.",Rich J
40,Still a fun walk,"Besides the beach, the pier and the restaurants, this is the most important reason to visit the area. Still charming but if you are looking for high end, go up to Beverly Hills. Still a nice afternoon stroll with plenty of places to quench your thirst and hunger!",DJBradachNaples_FL
50,My favorite palce in Santa Monica,My favorite palce in Santa Monica!I love to visit 3rd Street Promenade everytime we visit the US. We like watching all the talented people performing everyday. Lots of nice food and shopping is great.,KievSlavik
40,Ideal Outdoor and Indoor Shopping,"When I first moved to Los Angeles I spent almost every weekend at the Third Street Promenade. It is filled with lots of interesting shops, restaurants and coffee places. If you like shopping Santa Monica Place has almost everything you need. There are also many more shops outsideTo be honest some of the places I ate on the 3rd Street Promenade weren't that great so I can't reccomend them. Some of them had great seating for people watching but offered food that was either not that great or very expensive. But overall Santa Monica has lots of good restaurants. My favorite is Fritto Misto which serves great Northern Italian cusine (located at Colorado & 6th). I also like Rockenwagner a lot, although it can be pretty expensive.If you are near the Third Street Promenade you are not far from the Santa Monica Pier. So take a walk on the pier or just enjoy the view of one of the best beach towns anywhere.",JohnB00007
30,The usual collection of stores,Same old stores you see everywhere else. Nice that it is a promenade with pedestrian traffic only. Would like to see more local stores that aren't part of a big chain.,Gloria L

40,Nice Shops and Atmosphere,"The shops and atmosphere are very nice. On the weekend there were street actors singing, acting, or selling crafts which was charming.Unfortunately the homeless are a sad part of this area. They are present at all times of day and all the places we walked. It was sad and disturbing - I'm not sure if there is any help for them.",goldendiv
50,Love this area,"Every city/town should have a community spot like this. Great shops, wonderful restaurants and entertainment everywhere. We happened upon their movie night on the street - great to see all the families enjoying the evening. No visit to Santa Monica is complete without a visit to this area.",N O

50,Great shopping,"Great shopping and eateries. Watch out for the hobo's though, there are alot of them, mostly they don't bother you",AJW12
30,Another place to shop.... meh,"The area is nice in that you can jaywalk streets without worrying about cars... Lots of stores...Lots of places to spend money....great for a cloudy (or foggy) morning/day, but I would say Santa Monica and the surrounding area has much more to offer than this single shopping area. By the way, parking in Santa Monica is a general nightmare, so one good thing about the Promenade is once you've parked your car, you are done with it and can go shopping. Personally, I don't travel to new places just so I can go shopping, but I will sa, if you're in Santa Monica and need/ want to buy some things, from hair salon to GNC to surf shop clothes to Chipotle and McDonalds, this is your one-stop place. It's really nice, but not the main reason to visit Santa Monica.",Travelr101
50,Busy with shoppers and acts.,"After dinner at the Mall we strolled along the Promenade and enjoyed all kinds of acts, from simple music performances over acrobats to skateboarding dogs. Some atores were open until late and invited to late night shopping.",Scorpiotic

40,"Pleasant, but nothing special","We spent an hour or so here so the kids could get in some shopping. It was pleasant with nice shops and no cars, but none of the stores was anything you could not find elsewhere. My favorite part was sitting on a bench listening to a fabulous bass player do wonders on eclectic tunes while my kids were in the stores. For that alone it would get 4 stars.",Ejeffrey
30,Predictable collection of clothes shops,Do not expect too much and you will not be disappointed. Vast number of similar fashion and clothes stores with some cafes and restaurants. Hardly a balanced shopping street but great for lightweight leisure-shopping.All very neat and tidy but then so are many other pedestrian shopping streets the world over. One visit enough unless you are a local. Apple store is memorable.,Stephen J
50,Everything you'd want from a shopping street,"Great choice of shops, restaurants, bars, outdoor seating, cinemas.. especially nice in the early evening.",prettyinpink23
30,What a disappointment.,This is no different than any large mall. I don't see why it's supposed to be such a big deal. We were hoping to see some different shopping experience. It's the same old chain stores located in every other mall,RW1963
50,You must visit 3rd St Promenade if you come to Santa Monica,"Very nice place to go for shopping or eating with your spouse or your family. Very important shops are located here and frequently have sale offers for tourists, depending on the period of the year. The promenade is very ample, neat, well lightened, and comfortable. A big Apple shop and TJ MAX or Levis or Diesel and other brands have shops here. Nice restaurants are at hand as well as a big Starbucks facility.

50,give yourself time to walk here!,"If you're into casual shopping, the streetfront rows of surf and casual attire will totally take up a good 1 or 2 hours of your time. If you want more high quality stuff, step into the mall at the end of the promenade, which is gorgeous and open air. The rooftop ""food court"" looks like a lounge at a 5-star resort (while you're still able to get your typical greasy food court meals, perfect combo haha!). Then wait until evening/nighttime and walk slowly back along the promenade, There are so many really good live musicians- make time to watch at least a few!",KellieM612
50,Definitely where the action is,Third Street Promenade was definitely where you'll find the most action in Santa Monica.

40,"Crowded, but nice; great for shopping","We walked a lot of the third street promenade on our way from our parking garage to the Santa Monica Pier. The area has such a clean feeling and it seems the weather is always perfect. There is plenty of people watching to do, along with multiple street performers. All types of eating places, shopping and pubs are all in or around the promenade. Be sure to check out the Nike store as it is like an art museum of Nike gear. If you are in to that sort of thing of course. The reason for 4 stars over 5 is just that after you’ve been here more than a time or 2 it becomes a bit touristy for our taste and is something to see once on your trip and then perhaps avoid. Always nice to walk through if it’s not too slammed.",HanKelly
50,Got Money?,Make sure you walk through the Promenade before going anywhere else. This is a nice walk toward the evening hours (even on Sunday). Plenty of places to shop and window shop. I guess it could be akin to you going to the mall on your vacation. If you travel with women or daughters this is something you can’t avoid. Keep in mind there is a TJ Maxx in the area.,findkirk

40,"Shop a while, then shop some more","I surprisingly found this not too traumatic, not really into shopping but it kept me entertained for a day. There is heaps of shopping, and the street entertainers make it more than just a trip to the mall.

Run the gauntlet of street performers, most of them only separated by a hundred yards or so...the cacophonic (if it wasn't a word before, it is now) overlap between pitches can be really irritating. I enjoyed watching the Christeas, a brother-sister-sister family right out of The Brady bunch, and just a bit too cutsie-pie for this jaded Londoner. Word to the wise - the line at Starbucks was daunting and it took about 20 minutes to get served. Towards the evening the salsa dancer show-offs come out to play, but by then we were already making our way to dinner.",PlanetLondoner

It's a car-free walking mall with great shopping and numerous restaurants at all price points.

Also close by is the Santa Monica Pier with a fabulous ocean view Ferris wheel, antique merry-go-around and other fun rides.",Karen K

30,Good for people-watching,"It gets awfully crowded. The musicians are so close to each other that cacophony sometimes results when they're in different keys. I do very much like the teen band The Cristeas. The Jesus freak about halfway down the promenade is incoherent, and doesn't make eye contact with those very few people to stop to listen to him.",LordWallington

30,WARNING! We had all our luggage stolen from our car in the parking structures!,"I wanted to write this as a warning to other travellers. We visited the third street promenade as we were too early to check in to our hotel. We parked in one of the official parking structures (multistorey car parks). When we were at lunch our car was broken into and ALL of our suitcases (4) were stolen from the trunk. Absolutely NOTHING was on show, all of it was hidden away. When we reported it to the police they said it was common and they had police cars circling the car parks for this very reason, but obviously not all the time. They said the thieves recognise hire cars and target them and would have had our suitcases in their vehicle within a few minutes. Watch out everyone!",Fen-and-Borge
50,Fabulous shops!,"This place is a shopper's paradise! It has all the shops you could want in one place including Abercrombie, American Eagle, Levi, Old Navy, Victorias Secret, Barnes & Noble, Converse, Forever 21, Papyrus and lots more! The mall at the end of the promenade is great for those with slightly more expensive tastes with Bloomingdales, Sears and Tiffanys. The promenade is peppered with an array of great restaurants - be sure to stop for a margarita in the Mexican bar and don't miss Barneys Beanery and Travastere.",travellergirl62

30,If you are in to mass production stuff,"I was not all that impressed with Santa Monica's Third Street Promenade. Most of the stores are national chains that most every big city has. Parking is difficult. The AMC theater only has a few screens. There are a few individual restaurants, but also some chain restaurants. There were a couple of street performers, some homeless, lots and lots of people, kids, dogs, cops, etc. If you live somewhere remote, this might be exciting. Not so much if you live in any medium sized city in America.",Erik C
50,Don't miss it!,"Forget the pier...head to the 3rd street promenade. Felt safe when it was later walking around.

40,Definitely worth seeing,"The shops, bistros, coffee places all made it a lovely little street to visit. There are plenty of shops and you would struggle not to buy anything.",Lindyloo1
20,Too Crowded,Parking was a nightmare. The promenade was so crowded with people you could barely move (I went on a Saturday). The street performers were awful and made getting around worse. The stores were totally generic. There were a lot of choices for places to eat though which is why I added a star....,Miss K
40,Shopping Stroll,"The Third Street Promenade had a fair amount of chain retail stores that we have at home - we skipped those. There was also a good amount of local shops which were quite enjoyable. They have mall-esque kiosks along the middle of the walkway with a few unique items that are worth a look. The toy store called ""Puzzle Zoo"" was my favorite shop. The staff there play with all the toys and give great recommendations.",Regina M
40,"Nice shopping, restaurants, and entertainment","We made an evening of it, parked at Santa Monica beach, walked the pier, then over the bridge and a few blocks to the 3rd St Promenade. The area was very lively - many street performers who were entertaining. Lots of shopping, movie theaters, and restaurants. There are police walking around as well as easily identified Promenade personnel (they are all wearing the same shirt) who can help you with directions or whatever you need. The public restrooms are clean and constantly attended. A fun place to walk around - probably something there for everyone.",Tabby_D_1271

40,A touch of european culture,"I like the fact that it is an open space pedestrian walkway of eateries and browsing. I like the fact that it is relatively cigarette free and the police presence. There is an element of obnoxious youth activity at times with the skate boards and some people looking to pick pocket and some suspected drug dealing, but they try to get it done quick and slick. There are some homeless people, but not as much as in downtown Los Angeles and Venice Beach. This area is delightful in the sense that it does attract a variety of cultures and there are some live street performers.",Annabell77
40,Easy going and excellent shopping,"The Third Street Promenade is perfect for a leisurely stroll to people watch, It's even better if you're looking to shop for a few items.

I loved the Puma store and it was neat to see everything from a Tesla dealer to Diesel to the Apple store. Great way to pass some time in SoCal.",Trayson H
30,Shopping Variety but not Customer Service,The variety of shops was great but the service was not. I entered no fewer than 30 clothing stores and only in one was I asked if assistance was needed. I would have appreciated help. You wonder which store asked? Nordstroms. Nordstroms #1 in customer service even in Santa Monica!,Delores_2468

50,Promenading on the Promenade,"LOVED the Third Street Promenade! Tons of shopping for all budgets. So many food choices it was hard to pick a restaurant.My friend is a smoker and tried to smoke as we walked along the promenade. A waiter from a restaurant came out and told her that she could get a ticket for smoking on the Promenade. So she put it out ASAP. We appreciated him telling her that.Also, for those who are disabled and have a handicap tag on their car, it is free to park at any of the meters in Santa Monica according to the policemen we saw walking along the promenade. This woman with a handicap tag was starting to put money in the meter and they went up to told her she didn’t need to. I thought that was really nice of them.",GregTerriGrimes
40,Street Music and good food,Walking up and down the Promenade offered a great place to hear some great music. Musicians from around the world come to the Promenade and seranade people walking by. It was lovely spending an afternoon (or evening) strolling the Promenade and listening to all kinds of music.Definately worth checking out if you are in Santa Monica.,aprilstein
50,Great spot for people watching,"I live close enough to the promenade to come by on the weeknights, but I really love visiting on weekends. There are all kinds of street performers, from the out-of-touch 80-year-old belly dancer, to some very talented musicians and even (my personal favorite) english bulldogs that can skateboard.There is tons of shopping. I love to browse through Kitson and some of the other more eccentric stores if I don't have anything i need to look for. They also have more fun California souvenirs than you would find on, say, Hollywood Blvd.Tons of great restaurants, too. Loteria is a favorite, and the creperie on the South end of the promenade. I also love Johnny's for an affordable and filling meal. Their calzones are enormous. Definitely enough going on here to make a night out of it.",alyssa_boone

I do just about all my shopping along Third Street. Visit Whole Foods Market, Traders Joe, the carwash on Edinburgh, Joan's on Third for a meal, and California Wok and Mimosa Nail Salon where Third runs into the Beverly Center. Of course, you MUST GO to The Grove and The Farmer's Market on Third. Trust me, just go. Oh, eat at Unami Burger at the Grove. Best burger in Los Angeles . . . and it has a great vegetarian burger option.",mermaidsylvia

40,Cool place for locals and tourists alike,"I always tell my out of town visitors to visit the Promenade. Fabulous people watching along this several block long pedestrian only promenade filled with shops, restaurants, theatres, street performers, coffee shops, etc. bookended by Wilshire Blvd. on the north which has a giant Barnes and Noble Bookstore with a Starbucks and Santa Monica Place on the South which is a several story lux shop complex with great food places on the rooftop (there is a wine bar with views to the ocean). There are 3 theatres (check AMC for listings as AMC owns all three) so you can go and eat, shop, catch a film and just meander with an ice cream cone in your hand. Go a couple of blocks west and you will find yourself on PALISADES PARK overlooking the ocean...a great place to stroll. BTW near the Pier you will find a large homeless population so if that is a concern to you be warned. Also as in all big cities watch your pockets on the promenade. But to end on a good note - just a tip that there is a place to get bicycles on the first floor of the Santa Monica Place which you can take down to the bike path at the Pier.",AFoolForTravel

It makes for a lovely afternoon stroll, or warm evening walk, sit on a bench.(they also have very cold foggy nights too, typically june thru august).

40,What a Pleasant Surprise,"I'm from Northern New Jersey and I was working my way down the Pacific Coastal Highway. As I went through Malibu into Santa Monica I was pleasantly surprised by this wonderful shopping area. They permanently closed off the street to traffic and for several blocks the streets are filled with only pedestrians and lined with an assortment of shops, restaurants and movie theaters. At one end of the promenade is a full mall with Bloomingdales and Nordstrom and some other high end stores. Frankly this is what I thought I'd see in Malibu based on hearing so much about Malibu having the most expensive real estate in The USA. There were also numerous performers singing in the streets and all of them were very talented on the day I was there. I'm not a big shopper but I enjoyed walking through this area.",AtomicReviewer

50,A Favorite Destination,"My wife loves our visits to the Third Street Promenade. We've vacationed in LA many times over the past several years and most every time we've included a visit here. Certainly many of the stores here are those you'll find elsewhere. However, I go along with my wife for a couple of hours to see if these sames stores have something that she's not found elsewhere. The street performers are a mixed group, ranging from some who are rather talented to those who offerings puzzle me.We've found a few places that offer rather good food. We tried a restaurant that has opened since our last visit to 3rd Street, the Hummus Bar Express. We shared a delicious salad late one evening.Parking is within a short walk. The City of Santa Monica has a number of parking structures around and about the Promenade.If your visit includes a Saturday, make sure to take in the Farmers' Market, between 2nd and 3rd Street on Arizona Ave.",fallfan54

You can walk around just for the view...or do some real hardcore shopping. It is a great place for people watching. Street musicians get permits to play...Recording Artist Andy Grammar was discovered here on the Third Street Promenade. It is three blocks from the beach, and at the end of the Third Street Promenade is Santa Monica Place which expands your shopping and dining experience. I have been here bunches of times.

30,Average,We were on a short transit in LA and went to the 3rd street promenade for the day to see Santa Monica pier as well. It is within walking distance to the pier.We were there a couple of days before the new year so perhaps many performers were on leave. We saw a handful of performers on the street but only 1 or 2 were interesting.Its mainly just a short shopping street with some entertainment. We could only occupy ourselves for an hour or so there before getting bored and heading off.There were only one or two souvenir shops.,T5555

Not every restaurant is dog friendly, but some will let you sit outside if you have a small one. I loved the Kitson outlet shop and bookstore. They had celebrity authors doing book signings often. There are so many cute little shops, friendly and talented street performers and great places to meet up for lunch or dinner with friends. Parking can sometimes be a pain, there are lots in the area that are your best bet. They even offer a free security service to walk you to your car in the garage if you ever feel unsafe at night.

We walked up the stairs and stroll on Ocean blv promenade (very nice pathway with palm trees and other plants and trees and benches), looking down at the ocean on one side and at very nice architecture across the street, wating for the sunset (one of the nicest place to watch it). After this wonderful view, we walked to 3rd street and went to eat a very good italian restaurant called Trastevere (see other review) and finally did some shopping during the rest of the evening, before returning to our car, down by the beach (walking 5 to 10 minutes max).",Ben0844

30,Not Impressed,"We found the Third Street Promenade to be a nice place to stroll in the evening. There were lots of people eating, drinking and listening to street musicians. During the day I went back to shop. I found the stores to be standard mall stores with nothing really unique. I love to shop, but did not buy one single thing there.

That's why I chose to shop on 3rd street. It's very pleasant and less stressful, since you can enjoy fresh air and, if you get lucky, art presentations in the streets! My tip is: do your shopping before it gets dark, and at the time of the sunset, run to the Santa Monica Pier. You're going to see an amazing nature show!",Manuela Hollós
50,The place where its happening in Santa Monica,Lots of stores - restaurants and street performers.

50,Great pedestrian shopping area,"Third Street Promenade has all the standard shops you'd find in a mall, and then some - but since it is a public space, you also get the benefit of street performers and ""real life"" that would be regulated much more strictly inside a mall. (I suppose there are still regulations because all performers I saw had a pretty high standard - but it still seems more varied and lively than any mall environment.)To me, it seems much like European shopping areas that give pedestrians priority, and I think that is a very good thing. There are also a bunch of good restaurants and some movie theaters with nice old-fashioned neon lights, and I love the dinosaur fountains along the promenade.Even if you aren't into shopping, this is a good place to walk along to watch people and enjoy the atmosphere.

The friendly guy at the desk urged me to take it as I was already there, so for 15 dollars I had a fantastic salsa lesson. In my touristy shoes and outfit and all!

50,Menagerie of awesomeness,"The promenade is an integral part of the Santa Monica community and culture. There are movie theaters, book stores, clothing stores, restaurants, artists, and street performers. As a matter of fact, I used to be one of the street performers back when I was a teenager in 2000 and early 2001.The collection of people is so diverse and ranges from trendy to industrial goth, skater, and hip hop. The neighborhood is safe, so you can stay and hang out until its dark when it transforms into a whole new place. The bus runs right by the entrance of the promenade so it makes it easy to access. Its not as cool as it used to be in the 90's, but its still pretty snazzy. When I visited friends for New Years in Lawndale, I made it a point to travel up to Santa Monica, just for the promenade alone. Yer only 3 blocks from the beach if you want to walk down there and swim, shop, or hang out. Id recommend the promenade to everyone. (PS... to any tourists with kids, be sure to check out Toys R US, located right by the promenade. Its 2 levels of awesome. The far end of the promenade also leads to the mall.)",lilith_fury

Stop at Starbucks, sit outside and people watch. For a girl from the East Coast, this was fun for me. All kinds of different outfits will stroll by, some with the popular accessory of the moment, the tiny dog.",Songbird811
50,favorite,"Hands down my favorite place/ experience in So Cal. This street is blocked from car traffic for pedestrians. The shops are great, not too cheap or expensive, but a few of those here and there. I really like the street preformers, usually great singers. The cops patrol and check their volume with some type of decimal reader (believe it or not!) so it doesn't get out of hand. They also must have permits from the city. Plenty of great restaurants with seating outside on the sidewalk. They all have menus posted by the door, so there's no suprises. They're aren't too many homeless people harrassing in this area, which is nice. They are usually lurking around the outskirts, but I haven't had any serious problems with any. I love that this place is just a 10 or 15 minute walk to the pier. The trees are beautifully lit at night. I would recommend getting here during the day and staying through the night. Remember to bring a jacket, it is always colder than inland/ LA area, sometimes as much as 10 -15 degrees cooler Farenheit.",threeseas
50,Fun place to spend time shopping and walking with family and friends,I have now been in this area a few times and absolutely am in love with Santa Monica! The atmosphere in this whole area is so desireable. The 3rd street promenade is basically an outdoor mall that you can walk up and down. There are tons of shops and places to eat as well as live performers for entertainment. There is something for just about everybody here! There are many stores that I had previously heard of as well as stores that I had never heard of. It is fun for me to browse these stores and see what is for sale and what kind of stuff the locals are into. This is a fun place to be at night when it is all lit up and the weather can be fantastic! I recommend this for a stress free night out. You don't have to worry about much at all besides walking and enjoying the company of whoever you are with. It can be a bit chilly (as it was for us) so you might want to bring a jacket just in case. I would come here everytime I am in the area and recommend it to all of my family and friends.,lesliea277

30,Good for people watching,"TSP is good for people watching, getting bumped into by clueless tourists and buying generally overpriced merchandise. Nothing you can't find in an average-nice mall, but does have nice surroundings. Parking can be very difficult- the public lots all have a sign telling you how many spaces are available, but there are usually about 20 fewer spaces available than shown. Even the City of Santa Monica (owner of the parking structures) admits this is an issue. Cheap for the area, though.

There is a lot to do around 3rd St. Promenade thou, from fancy restaurants to cheap eateries and from Armani Exchange and Banana Republic to Old Navy .There are a myriad of performing artists singing, playing instruments, doing acrobatics, etc. Some are a bit loud and not that good, which the city really should get rid of. At the Broadway end of the Promenade there is one of L.A's premiere shopping malls, the newly opened Santa Monica Place, with a tremendous variety of upscale shopping like Hugo Boss, Michael Kors, Tiffany & Co., Barneys, Bloomingdales, Nordstrom, Burberry, Coach, Emporio Armani, AllSaints, Kitson, Kenneth Cole, Louis Vitton, Tory Burch, Ted Baker, etc., and really good restaurants like Ozumo, La Sandia, Pizza Antica, The Curious Palatte, etc.3rd Street Promenade is a good place to go for a stroll and excellent for people watching.

50,"It's a Street Mall, but a block away from the beach","Has lots of original restaurants along with the touristy type restaurants like Hooters, pubs with outdoor patios, two movie theaters and boutique shops and stores like Brookstone, Barnes & Noble and Anthropologie. It stretches a few blocks and then at the end of it is a gigantic indoor mall with also new stores and a top rate food court. The parking is all along the next two blocks over and the garages are pretty cool in that they have a lighting system that points to open spots so that there's no guess work. Also they have a camera system that will find your spot for you if you can remember your license plate number and are not parked on the top floor. The Promenade is two short blocks away from the beach, so you can walk down there and stroll in the sand after dinner. They also have EXCELLENT street performers (the Chinese guy who flips the bowls onto his head is amazing) and I heard that people like Cobie Callait got their start playing on the Promenade. so who knows? Maybe the next person you watch while cooling your dogs near the dolphin fountain will be the next chart topper and you can say, ""I saw them when I visited the Third Street Promenade!""",Babbbles

It is usually crowded with tourists due mainly to the presence of street performers who pass the hat after each performance.As a local and an adult, I avoid going here. I consider it the perfect place for getting your pocket picked. Tourists sit outside the various side walk cafes and sip their drinks while people watching. Homeless people wander around wearing cardboard signs requesting cash. Teenagers shop and flirt.There are police present everywhere and this reduces drug dealing, public intoxication and other unsavory activities.There are also several first run multiplex movie theaters thrown into the mix for good measure.",cuppajoe2

At one time there were half a dozen book stores here, but they are gone, however, the cinemas and restaurants are still here to provide entertainment. The management licenses many different street performers, artists and performers so there is almost always something going on, especially on weekends. If you are looking for something to do in Southern California, this is a good place to come and spend time and watch the incredible diversity of people going past you. The surrounding blocks are interesting too.",og84

You can play at the Apple Store, browse at Barnes & Nobles and the like, while listening to some of the street performers, or just walk and soak up the atmosphere.If you are a regular shopper in the LA area, Third Street does not normally give you the staple ingredients: no Target, no Macy's, etc. This is offering a specific selection of shops, and if you are looking for the somewhat more upscale, or very upscale, not typical shopping experience, this is one of the places to go!",Philip_Coppens

50,"Nice place to eat, shop or just take a stroll","Everytime I have visited Santa Monica, there were already so many things to do that I never got around to going here. My son is now 14 and has a friend he wanted to hang out with. I was with my daughter at Pacific Park on the pier. They wanted to go walk along the Venice Boardwalk but since it was getting dark, they had to choose a safer place. This was it. My son said he had the greatest time. My daughter and I went there later in the evening and never ran into them because the outdoor mall is at least 3 blocks long. My daughter and I also enjoyed ourselves. There were places to eat or get a beverage, clothing stores, specialty shops (such as candy stores and toy stores) and since it was the end of the holiday season, there was even an ice skating rink at the very end. There is also a multiplex movie theater. The shop fronts are all very nice. The area is very clean and beautifully landscaped with strips of vegetation and big statue type fountains.They had it beautifully decorated for the holidays including a huge Christmas tree. Third street is closed to vehicles. It is covered with a cobblestone type surface mostly. All of the eating establishments also have outdoor seating and most have outdoor heaters. My daughter was cold (an evening in January) so we stood by one of the patios to warm up. At the other end of the Promenade was another outdoor mall with a Nordstroms and other stores. So you literally walk from one mall to the next. Even if you don't like shopping, this is a very nice area to just walk through. I felt very safe here and also did not worry about my son and his friends. Also, the employees at all the establishments we visited were very nice as you can tell they enjoy working there. We were on foot so did not have to worry about parking but there were quite a few parking structures in the area. You can also easily walk to the Santa Monica Pier from the Promenade so you don't have to re-park your vehicle. We took a bus which was only a dollar each person and a great way to get there from where we were staying, which was about 2 miles away. You should check out this place. I am so glad that I finally did.",akidcagal

What is unique about the Promenade is the street performers. They are all amazing! Every one of them has a permit, and you can see an entire circus. There are many musicians who have been signed to record labels, there are acrobats, and the big draw when we were there was a couple guys doing acrobatic break dancing.

50,An enjoyable shopping and entertainment destination,"Some of the old-timers complain that the Third Street Promenade has lost its unique small business vibe and has now turned into a more generic outdoor shopping mall dominated by chain retail outlets you can find anywhere in the country. It's a fair critique, but there is so much more to the Promenade and the experience there.Santa Monica has wisely provided many multi-story garages with two hours of free parking, located on both sides up and down the spine of the Promenade ... on 2nd and 4th streets. With the exception of movies and long meals, you can get most of what you need to do within that time. If you go over, parking isn't that expensive ... surprisingly. After six, there is a single parking fee that isn't that bad.There are many performers who set up shop throughout the Promenade and most of them are of a very high caliber.Besides some of the more obvious retailers like Apple, Lucky Brand, Restoration Hardware, Pottery Barn, etc ... there still are some very cool bookstores and private retailers and loads of restaurants for any kind of taste.The weather ... of course ... is as good as it gets.

50,"If the exchange rate is good, head to 3rd street with an empty case","Flying into the USA from Australia, Los Angeles' Santa Monica is a great place to start your journey. Overlooking the Pacific Ocean, it is also home to the excellent shopping of the Third Street Promenade.Covering three long blocks as well as a newly updated shopping centre located at the strip's southern end, Third Street features fashion retailers running from budget to pret-a-porter, an extensive variety of bars and restaurants, plenty of specialty stores, several cinemas and lively street entertainers.A leisurely stroll for the shopping-ready will take a half-day, as the variety is enormous. Shopping highlights include: Banana Republic (chinos etc), Zara (affordable high-fashion), H&M (of-the-moment youth fashion), Abercrombie & Fitch (frat boy fashion), American Eagle (affordable Abercrombie & Fitch), Urban Outfitters (hip clothing & homewares), The Gap (duh), Benetton, Guess, Footlocker, Adidas, Diesel, Armani Exchange, Victoria's Secret and Barnes & Nobel (one of the last remaining book superstores).The new Santa Monica Place shopping centre is a triumph of 'lifestyle centre' design, mixing high-end retailers in with department stores, retail favourites and some great bars and restaurants. Highlights: Bloomingdales (upscale dept store), Nordstrom (more upmarket dept store), Niketown, Kitson (cool fashion, gifts & homewares), CB2 (slick homewares), G-Star demin and Tiffany & Co.At the time of writing, America is on sale thanks to a dire federal financial situation. Thusly, never assume the price on the tag is final. Some stores have discounted prices that are discounted further or discounts that may not even be advertised on the ticket or rack, so it's worth checking a price with a staffmember before deciding that something is too expensive. If you can afford it, plan on taking an empty case to the USA and start to renew your wardrobe right here in sunny Santa Monica.A special shout-out recommendation for Cabo Cantina, a bar and Mexican restaurant between Old Navy and the Apple store (Northern-most block of 3rd Street Promenade). This loud, lively place is a great spot to experience life amongst the locals. Full of flat-screen TV's showing mainly American sport, the food is delicious and plentiful, as are the huge margaritas. Get amongst it and hang out with the locals with a 36oz. Mega Margarita, enjoy some music trivia and win some beads. You can either engage with the always-chatty Americans, or simply sit back and people-watch for a night you won't easily forget.",KICon

40,Great area for some casual shopping / eating,"We stayed on Ocean Avenue so we were very close to the Promenade and visited it often during our week long stay to Santa Monica.We liked just walking up and down the promenade and people watching - taking in the sights and sounds of the area. As far as shopping goes, it mostly is all retail chains as the local stores have gotten pushed out as time goes on. While retail chains are not always bad - they just don't have the charm or small local stores. As far as restaurants, again there are several chains - but we did find a good local one we really liked - Monsoon Cafe (Asian). I would recommend going there. We also caught one movie there which was very convenient - and there are three theatre options to choose from!We even seen several celebrities during out visits there - who just hang out and eat / shop like the rest of us, which made people watching even cooler! Apparently this area is frequented by celebrities all the time. The area is also frequented by performance artists - most of which are REALLY BAD. I just have to mention this as it did get a bit overwhelming / annoying at times, but no one over pressured us for any money or donations.We really liked this area - even though now that I think more about it - I cannot say exactly why. It just had a fun vibe to it and is a nice way to spend some time in the beautiful sunny California weather - while doing some shopping, taking in some eats, and maybe seeing some famous people hanging out just like the rest of us!

Because it is pedestrianised it is easy to get from one side to the other. I did find the stock in alot of the shops was not as good as their other stores and as this was my last stop i had waited to purchase several items until i got here. Ended up disappointed :( Mostly all highstreet stores then you have Santa monica place, the new outdoor mall at one end. This had bloomingdales and Nordstrom. Was delighted tosee an All Saints store! Plus it had a great sale while I was there.

50,Don't miss the Farmers Market on Saturdays!,"We stayed near the Promenade during our visit, so we came here a few times. The shops were cool. We weren't overly impressed with the dining selection, but did enjoy a nice sidewalk lunch at Lago one day. The favorite thing at the Promanade was the Saturday morning Farmer's Market. It was a feast for the senses - it was beautiful, fragrant, tasty. It's every Saturday from 8:30 to 1:00. Don't miss it! Most of the vendors there provide samples. We had to buy several batches of strawberries for my 5 year-old to eat along the way, they were so delicious!",KAHLJH

I even stopped by the Equinox gym and got a day pass. It was there where I met a trainer named Dillon who informed me of all the other places I should check out. He told me to check out the Santa Monica ""stairs"", which ended up being one of the highlights of my trip. I told him next time I come back I am definitely training with him. Whether you are with your friends, family, or even by yourself, 3rd Street has something for everyone. As far as prices go, I was expecting a HUGE increase, but it wasn't even noticeable, so for all of those scared that the prices are ridiculous because of the location can relax :) Hope this helps!",SarahBethAnderson
50,One of the best places to shop & eat in Santa Monica,"I'm a local here, and this must be one of the best places to frequent.They have all the best places to eat. I love all the shops there.It's a great Sunday Afternoon outing, or an evening on the town",SuzanS59
40,Nice place to shop/eat,"This place is nothing spectacular, but it is what it is so idk why so many complaints. its a pretty nice place to spend a few hours walking around. Plenty of stores if you are into shopping, but I just usually browse around until we are hungry amd then choose from one of the many restaurants in the area. Yankee doodles is great if you want to catch a game. There is a good place for crepes also at one end of the st. I recomend . Yes, there are numerous homeless people that frequent the area, but personally i've never had any negative experience with any of them amd cannot recall having been alked personally for any $.",rayandgabby

You don't have to shop to enjoy this place and there are a few lots that offer free/cheap parking before 5PM. It's also a minute walk over to the beach and pier too.,vancouverVioletBc
30,Average mall stores but nice to walk around,"This three block long, outdoor mall was pretty nice. Street performers were interesting. The stores were pretty average. We only went into a few. A lot of people bring their dogs, which is fine, but look out for dog poop. There is not faster way to ruin a day than stepping in dog doo, they did try to keep the place clean though. Parking was cheap but getting to the parking structure was miserable.",dodg1988
40,Great atmosphere - ordinary shopping,"The atmosphere is definitely very great. The lighting at night time is a treat for the eyes. There are many movie screens and average street perfomances. This promenade is closed to traffic and open only to pedestrians, and may slightly remind you of the Broadway in NYC. Recommended for a relaxing stroll in the afternoon or late eveningsHowever, the shopping there is quite ordinary and nothing special, much of the usual variety you can get anywhere else also,",vs_hi
50,LOVED the promenade,"This was probably one of my favorite spots we visited in Santa Monica.

50,I really liked Third Street Promenade,"Being from the East Coast, this was quite a pleasant surprise. Taking full advantage of Santa Monica's insanely nice weather, the outdoor promenade was a natural. And what's not to like about an LA attractions where cars are off limits? The live music, the shops (not very unique, but still), the restaurants and the proximity to the beach make this a must-see for visitors to the LA area.",PhillyDweller
30,Ordinary Promenade,"Quite ordinary Promenade with the ordinary chain stores. But nice to be able to stroll and people watch without having to watch out for any cars. A lot of street performers and musicians in the evenings. One word of warning - do not eat on the Promenade, had a terrible pasta experience at the 100% fake ""Italian"" restaurant called Trastevere. Chose a restaurant on Ocean Avenue Instead.",sun010
20,May as well just go to the mall. Corporate America lives here.,"The stores here, at least 98% of them, are just stores you would find at any mall across America.

20,Not worth visiting,"There were 6 of us who visited the Third Street Promenade and we were all disappointed in the experience. The stores were the same ones you'd find in any city (Banana Republic, Gap, Pottery Barn, etc.) and the prices were high. There were many street people and too many aggressive ""donate money to help the (fill in the blank)"" collectors. There are no cars allowed in the Promenade area, but due to the pan handlers, the walking experience wasn't very enjoyable.We wanted to eat at one of the restaurants, but the meals were all extremely over-priced, so we left without eating. I would not recommend going out of your way to visit the Third Street Promenade.",Hi Flyer
50,Pedestrians rule,"I love all the fountains and pruned bushes in the shapes of animals that are in the middle of the street. There is a nice variety of shops and restaurants, but the best thing about the Promenade is that it's closed off to cars, so you can freely walk and explore the establishments and enjoy the southern California atmosphere.",interviewtraveler
20,Dr. Jekyll / Mr. PromenHyde,"My mom and I stayed in Santa Monica on a Thursday night, and decided to take a stroll down the promenade at about 9PM. We had heard so much about it, so we were excited to see this hot spot!Boy were we disappointed when we turned the corner and heard bums shouting expletives at each other, then were followed by another bum making farting noises with his mouth. He followed us for about 50 feet, getting closer and closer until we ducked into a coffee shop to lose him. We asked the girl at the counter if it's always this weird at night and she snorted and said ""It gets MUCH worse!"" We decided to head back to our hotel, and were confronted by another bum who stood in front of us, not letting us pass, screaming a disgusting story about what his grandfather made him do to a dog when he was younger. I'm trying to keep this review PG, but what was happening on those blocks was questionable, even for HBO programming!During the day, the promenade is a touristy, interesting spot to shop and watch people, but at night, it turns into a different creature all together! Though most of the bums MAY have been harmless, they were noisy and nervewracking and something I would never want to expose my family to. They would touch you and confront you, which to some people may be no big deal, but for two ladies alone, can be very scary.We were expecting a quaint little stroll down a street, but felt like we had wandered into an asylum. Enjoy at your own risk.",illgetthere
50,Something for Everyone,"The Third Street Promenade is definetly worth a few hours after you visit the pier. On the promenade, you will find tourists and locals strolling to a variety of shops movie theathers and restaruants. Frankly, it is a cross section of southern california that is not to be missed. There is also a place call Fatburger on the promanade. Locals know it well and the experience and food is fantastic. Would could have ate anywhere we wanted and are glad that we stopped at Fatburger.There is also lots of shopping on the Promenade and something for every budget. The stores become more upscale as you head north. Everything is nice and the area is very safe. Appropriate for families, couples, singles.",A Tripadvisor Member
30,Really nothing special.,"Just a typical shopping area : some restaurants, stores, and a few street entertainers. That's it. Same ol same ol. The shops were all standard like Puma, Prada, The Gap, Macy's, etc... The restaurants were all ordiary as well, with very expensive drinks - mixed drinks are $10....but that's what it costs every where in Santa Monica.So, it's no big thing to see.",LuvDCaribbean
