50,Left jnspired,"Such a treasure. Go experience this and leave inspired. The owners are there, willing and eager to answer any questions. They don‚Äôt rush you around the house. Make your reservations so that the traffic is controlled. Neighborhood is quiet, so respect the neighbors.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/june_b0t
50,Must see spot,You must reserve your mini tour and viewing of the house before you go. They are only open Saturday‚Äôs from 1-4pm. It‚Äôs $20 but it‚Äôs worth it in my eyes. You‚Äôll never see anything like it. Two artists live here and they have put their life‚Äôs work into tiling and putting mosaic work everywhere. The benches- the walkway- fountain- kitchen shelves- tables- floors- bathroom- you name it. I was amazed. Don‚Äôt miss it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Harttmann
50,Exactly the kind of thing you will see in Venice and no place else,"I love it that this couple followed their own ideas (and not some magazine) and created their dream. This is not just a hodgepodge of whatever shiny thing was lying around - this is thoughtfully created. Even if you get there when they're not open, there are two beautifully crafted benches for photos. And you can see through the fence to some of the yard. This is Venice!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SusanK751
50,Beautiful homeüè°beautiful coupleüíë,"The Mosaic Tile House is a gem in Venice Beach. Gonzalo and Cheri are lovely people and through their home share their love for each other and art in the most colorful way. Gonzalo walks you through and then you have time to explore. The longer you look, the more you will see. Definitely something you have to see in person to appreciate the work they have put into this home.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/taimewu
50,Don‚Äôt miss this!,"We heard about this house and visited after emailing the owners - who were kind enough to open their home (even though they were closed and only open on Saturday) on a Friday. This is really something special. Whimsical, beautiful, warm, bright (yes - I know that those are opposites!), mind-bending and eye-popping (in a great way! ) all at once. Do not miss this. I will never forget it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joanne2222
50,Really cool exterior,"I can‚Äôt imagine how much time and effort it took for the owners to create this amazing mosaic masterpiece. Every single inch of their yard, walls, house is covered with mosaic (except for the roof). It‚Äôs great for photos. If you want to do the tour, I think it‚Äôs $20/person.We visited on a weekday afternoon, so we only saw the outside, but that seemed to se enough. There was plenty of on street parking, as we were the only people there and it‚Äôs a residential street.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JenRed2014
40,Worth a look even if closed,They only do tours on Saturdays from 1 to 4 and recommend reservations. We got there too late to get inside but you can see plenty thru the fence. Worth a visit (get out of car and take a closer look).,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/babygame
40,"Fun, fun fun!",Very colorful and inspiriting! great for photo ops and they have done a fabulous job! I recommend visiting this area,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annemN5239QJ
50,A must visit,"Amazed by the creativity, by the effort, by the patience. It‚Äôs absolutely a hidden gem. Highly recommend",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/monrabdog
50,Worth the trip,"This house is BANANAS. As crazy as it looks from the outside, it‚Äôs even more crazy inside. Initially I thought it might not be worth the entrance fee, but after experiencing the tour I‚Äôm happy to I was wrong. The husband and I ended up riding Birds out there (don‚Äôt judge - it was only the once). The couple running the joint was super friendly and seem happy to share stories of how the house came to be the way it is. Take the tour. You‚Äôll get a great experience and great photos.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iliketara
40,Fun & Beautiful!,"I loved it! A charming experience, the couple that lives here is so sweet. The house is gorgeous and ornately covered in hand-made and recycled tile. I was unaware of the $15 fee to enter, but it's definitely worth it. Bring your camera, because there are a lot of photo opportunities.The house also has a gift shop where you can purchase pottery made by the couple. On the tour, you get to see both of their art studios. The outside of the house is the main attraction though, and either of them are happy to take your picture. A must-see quirk of the neighborhood that is worth the trek!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheSarahb501
50,Over The Top fabulous fantastic ART,"If you enjoy coloring outside the lines this is the place for you! Opens up the mind & so creative! I took someone for her Bday , part of the days outing ~ she could not contain her excitement!!! Call again and check times~make reservation! This is someone's personal home! Have fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YardSaleLdy
50,A Special Visit,"This house is awesome and special. It‚Äôs literally a house pretty much covered with glass and mirror mosaic. What started as a small project in the bathroom evolved into a beautiful therapeutic project. I won‚Äôt ruin the story more but it is definitely worth getting the tour from the husband or the wife, they will tell you some interesting things. If you want some real local art by an artistic love story that is unique I suggest you visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/XavierNY
50,WOW!!!,"We were in southern CA to visit folk and outsider art installations. This place takes the cake. This place is a cake, frosted in the most outrageous application of tiles and so-forth ever envisioned by mad bakers of mirth. I was happy to pay the price to exit (a hug).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peripatetictexan_12
50,A Hidden Gem...Make Time to Visit,"We almost didn't make it but so glad we got there just in time (you need reservations to visit this personal residential home). When we first arrived, the front yard was adorned with mosaic tile mixed in with the plants and flowers. The outside of the house was also covered from top to bottom. I wasn't blown away until the owners came out and started the tour of the interior of their house, their attached studio and art shop, and gave us the history of the house. It was incredible!! Not just the art and mosaic, but the personal connection the husband and wife team had all these years. You need to spend some time here to really appreciate the house. You will catch glimpses of the owner's love story, their lives together, their travels, etc. It's so inspiring and uplifting. Every corner tells a story and every wall is different. You don't know mosaic until you visit this house, tucked in a modest neighborhood in Venice. Definitely a highlight of our trip!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CultureLush
50,Make time to visit!big treat!!,"Just returned from a visit to the Mosaic tile house.It was truly amazing!The owners were so personable and lovely to share their home with strangers.There were about 20 visitors that afternoon .They invited us in on time,encouraged us to take pictures of anything,and the husband even took photos of us at their house,if we were alone.The house is true ly amazing.plan on being there about an hour.Bring a camera!Make a reservation too,only tour day is Friday afternoon.I took an uber to get there.It helps the uber drivers to have the exact address.The house is in a very nice residential neighborhood.I enjoyed walking around their neighborhood after the tour,many of the house are beautifully landscaped especially with succulants.I also found an amazing huge antique consignment store about a block away on Lincoln.Be prepared,it is HUGE! The house is a true labor of love for this couple.Fruit trees in the front yard,entire front yard covered in whimsy.Small gift shop in foyer.Kitchen and guest bathroom are crazy!Even the ceilings are tiled!Attactched to the house is their studios.Huge paintings and murals.One entire wall of husbands portraits over a span of 20 years.Husband has his own workshop of amazing metal art.Even a side yard of murals and tile!Back yard has a hot tub surrounded by a pergola of tile!I absolutely loved my visit.Everyone that was there had big smiles on all their faces.It was the highlight of my visit to LA.Lots of visitors from many countries.If you are also looking for a great lunch close by,you may need another uber,but I heard Lemonade was a really nice place to eat before or after your visit.I never made it,spent 2 hours in the antique shop!Hope you have time to visit this amazing home!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EileenL381
40,Bizarre but fascinating,"The couple that lives here have been putting tiles on every square inch of their house for 23 years. It is an odd hobby, to put it mildly, but the place is intriguing. I talked to Cheri for a while and she was outgoing, friendly, and of course, very knowledgeable about all aspects of putting tile on houses. If you are in Venice Beach, it is definitely worth a visit, but check the Website for opening hours. It is not open all the time as the couple actually lives there and doesn't run tours every day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Globe_trotter_100
50,OH EM GEE!,"I can't begin to say enough about this fabulous house! One Word.... GO! It is a candy colored masterpiece created by a beautiful artistic couple who will be your intimate tour guides. They have put their lifeblood into this project and it shows. It is constantly evolving to this day. It's just fabulous and a must see when in the area. It does not take long to go through and you are welcome to stick around and take pictures. Our hosts, the artists and owners were delightful, warm and welcoming. We are an artistic family so we could have stayed all day. Just go!!!!!! We Ubered from Abbott Kinney. The fee is $15 which you will gladly pay. The tour times are limited since this is the artist's home. Love, Love, Love!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cloverleaf3218
50,Wow! What fun!!!,"We had a hop on/hop off ticket for LA but this place wasn't near any stops so we had to use Uber to get there. This place is UNBELIEVABLE! So much to look at! The homeowners, Cheryl and Gonzales, are so welcoming and friendly! They give you a general tour and then let you roam about taking it all in! Really enjoyed looking at all these fun objects they have incorporated into the walls, ceiling, floors, furniture, gates, doors, fencing and yard! I took a lot of pics! They have a small gift shop of art items for sale too. They answer any questions you have and even let you use their restroom that is completely done with mosaic art! Highly recommend going to see this very unusual place!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EpicSpirit11
50,Well worth a visit!,"We found this place on Trip Advisor and we were not disappointed. We made reservations a day ahead with no problem for a Friday visit. It was easy to find and parking was a breeze. Cheri and Gonzalo were so nice and inviting. They are both very talented artists in multiple mediums. It's wonderful to meet people who are passionate about their work, and enjoy life. Their home and studio were immaculate and fascinating. We stayed over an hour and I'm sure we didn't see everything. I highly recommend visiting. They offer tours Friday-Sunday from noon until 4:00.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/katNashville_Tn
50,Hidden Gem near Venice Beach - worth the visit,"The Mosaic Tile House is easy to find in a quiet neighborhood, and there is plenty of parking along the residential street once you‚Äôre there. My husband, teenage daughter, and I visited and we all loved it. We booked via email about a month in advance because visits are by appointment only.Gonzalo and Cheri have created this amazing work of art all over their home, and are kind enough to share its whimsy with the public. When you walk up, you are amazed at all the mosaic tile and creative twists that you observe in the front yard and along the front fence. The front gate is locked and you ring a bell at your appointment time to be greeted and allowed entrance.When we were there, charming Gonzalo showed us around. He pointed out a few cool things that we may not have noticed on our own, and shared some of the history of his home. After a 15 minute casual tour, he allowed us to wander the grounds and indoors as much as we wanted, and we were able to take lots of photos. There are so many nooks and crannies full of creative artwork and tiles ‚Äì just mind-boggling. There is also a small shop inside where you can purchase handmade items if you‚Äôd like, but there is no pressure to buy.We spent about 30 minutes at the house, took tons of photos, and really enjoyed Gonzalo‚Äôs information. Highly recommend this quirky, special place. You feel really good and full of wonder when you leave. The $15 per person charge is well worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Steamboat323
50,OMG.....SO worth a visit. Amazing place and people. Book in advance.,"OK, first, I confess upfront I am ""into"" mosaics and especially the form of mosaics called piquette-assiette which uses broken china and found bits of anything and everything.This year we visited the piquette assiette house in Chartes, France and I have also visited a number of sites in Italy as well as Barcelona, Spain to see the work of Gaudi.So when my internet searches turned up Mosaic Tile House in Venice California I was interested in visiting and also looking for someplace we could take our Los Angeles relatives that they might not have visited before.I emailed Mosaic Tile House and received a quick reply with directions and booking information and organised our visit with no problems. On the day we arrived to a warm welcome from Gonzalo Duran who showed us around, and couldn't have been more hospitable.Mosaic House is a mosaic lovers must-see. It is colourful, exotic, fun, artistic, and full of light, life and energy. My non-mosaic cousins just kept walking around saying, ""amazing, amazing....amazing"". I took dozens of photos and bought a few things to bring home. The studio is a mosaic artists ""to die for"" and the whole place just leaves you feeling happy. Our brief visit with Cheri and our chat with Gonzalo added to our enjoyment of the time we spent. Two hours flew by.It's open by appointment and there are also set opening hours. All the information is easily accessible on the internet on their website. A highlight of our visit to California.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/binduAustralia
50,A Happy Place To be,"Cheri and Gonzalo were so warm and welcoming. I totally admire and was in awe of their 22yr Labor of Love. The vibrant color, textures create such a fun, whimsical place......how could you not be happy just being there. Well worth seeing. <3",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carolwU9291FA
50,Amazing concept!,Really cool concept. Awesome off the beaten path cool thing to see in Venice. It's crazy to think about how much effort had to go in to make the house look the way it does. It's a bit pricey to go in but worth it. Such an incredible site.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jvalliant
50,Very interesting,"Make sure you book a tour ahead. This house has been totally covered in tilework, rather like Watts Towers and extended at the back with a large workroom. The artists work in different mediums and it has taken them about 20 years to complete. The tour is led by one of the artists herself and is quite entertaining. This place is not normally listed on places to view but definitely worth the effort. Sheidow9 said they couldn't find it but it is definitely here, on Palms Blvd. Would suit anyone including children.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Joan1914
10,Not sure it exists.,Spent an hour walking the streets looking for this house and asking locals but no-one had heard of it. Very disappointed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sheidow9
50,OH you have to visit The Mosaic Tile house - Take the tour,"If you have a friend that needs some cheering or likes Mosaic/Art, his is the place to gofor an hour or 2. The colors the Artist everything is unbelievable. It's truly a ONE of a kind experience! The artists are friendly & fantastic. You can take a tour for very little $ & after get lunch at nearby restaurant.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YardSaleLdy
50,Fanciful Art House in Venice Beach!,"Venice Beach is full of art, crazy free spirits, and murals, but our favorite place by far has been the discovery of the Mosaic Tile House, owned and curated by artists Cheri Pann and Gonzalo Duran, full of handmade tiles, mirrors, toys, flattened bottles, wires, and offbeat layers of unusual found objects covering every square inch inside and out of their home! We found them online, and called for a personal tour, which the lovely Ms. Pann conducted, taking my son, my husband and me through the most beautiful art house we'd ever seen! 20 years of hard work and much fun is visible on every surface, and their own personal artist studio in the back is full of large paintings and art pieces that are wonderful as well! Get to know the spirit of Venice Beach by meeting these fabulous people!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShannonS425
