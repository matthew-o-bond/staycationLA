40,Lifestyles of the rich and famous,Take a stroll down this beach and you'll be able to see the luxury malibu beach houses (more like mansions!) as well as the beautiful ocean views.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/soccermom13
50,Worth the effort to get there,"This beautiful beach takes some effort to find. It‚Äôs blocked by a long series of expensive beach homes and has only a few points to access it ( visible on Google maps). Street parking is extremely limited and there do not seem to be any parking lots to access. No amenities nearby such as restaurants or bathrooms (bring snacks and drinks).It‚Äôs a narrow beach, saving you a long walk to the water. When we were there, only handful of people were there. Spotless place, no garbage.In our view, a much more relaxing place to be than the big public beaches like Santa Monica",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/flatlandermanitoba
50,One of the very best public access beaches in Malibu,We were lucky and grabbed a roadside spot next to a beach access point. Stroller down to an extremely clean beach with amazing views in both directions. The expensive beachfront houses come all the way down... almost to the waters edge...... the iconic view of Malibu in my opinion. Water was warm but it seemed to go very deep very quickly with a moderate undertow so be careful with kids. Worth a trip,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/283deanw
50,Amazing California Beach,"Beautiful, clean uncrowded beach. Parking is challenging but worth being patient. This beach is quiet and clean. Beautiful view. Walk and see the amazing homes or just sit and relax. This was a great break from the crowds and traffic of LA. Be aware internet service is almost impossible to get because of the location. Just another reason to disconnect and relax!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jennyr358
50,Great public access beach! Awesome sunsets!,We always go cruising threw Malibu. Then we do you can find different public access points to beaches if you pay attention to the brown and white signs. Free parking with peaceful beaches. The sound of the waves softly hitting the sand. Great location on any day of the week!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Yehbut
50,One of the nicest beaches I've ever seen,"We parked on the road and walked down an alley to get to the beach, minutes away. It was beautiful, very clean, very quiet.We lay on the beach for hours in blazing heat and there were only two other people there doing the same and one or two people walking a dog.Very nice to listen to the waves without the sounds of screaming kids.Fun to watch the sea gulls running away from the tide.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/abichloe1990
50,Watch the surfers from the pier!!,Watch the surfers from the Malibu pier. This is one of the classic LA beaches. But for all of the TV series shot at Malibu there sure do not seem to be as many really nice Malibu beach houses as one would imagine.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlennHAnderson
30,Wonderful Beach,What can you say but this is a beach in the Malibu area. It is beautiful and the sunsets beyond romantic.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dahuntraveler
50,A must see,This is a must see. A simple classic gorgeous ocean which smells so delicious and warms your face with sun and cools your skin in the evening. Count the stars listen to the waves and be if you are really quiet you just might hear the mermaids singing. üòâüê¨üå∫,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/302giannal
50,It's Malibu!,Carbon Beach is a world famous beach in Malibu. Beautiful place to visit to see the Malibu Vibe. Can get crazy busy on the weekends.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tessalovestravel
50,Beautiful Beach,"Amazing that this is actually accessible to the general public. There are a few entry points from the main road and onto the beach, so look out for those. It was as if my boyfriend and I were the only two people on the planet apart from the odd dog walker. Take your time, gaze up at the stunning houses, listen to the crashing waves and soak up some Californian sunshine. A must visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/969suziea
