10,Massage,"Very expensive for what it is. After filling out the paperwork, type of massage, amount of pressure requested, and areas to be massaged, I was led to a very clean and quiet room. When the therapist came in she asked what type of pressure I would like. I told her I wrote deep pressure on the paperwork and she said that she “didn’t do” deep pressure. I asked her what types of massages did she do. She responded “relaxation and light.” Well not what I requested and not usually what I like but I thought well I’m already here lying down so I guess will give it a go. The nassage lasted less than a full hour and she did not request any of the areas I had circled on the paperwork (face, hands, and head) I was very disappointed. I’ll stick to my $40 full body massage places from now on!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Liljennqt
10,Terrible,"Terrible terrible customer service. Doesnt honor promotions. Most people have stresses in their life, and need a massage. Why go somewhere that will create more tension.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nadyas409
10,Terrible,Employees are clueless to existing promotions. Manager is hard to get a hold of when you call. It took several calls to finally make adjustments to my account. Massage Envy needs to have better communication with nearby or all other locations.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/351quinnm
