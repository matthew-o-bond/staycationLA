50,Little Gem in a Small Town,"For a small, local museum, this was jam-packed with interesting things. We particularly enjoyed the exhibit about finding dinosaur bones as well as the steam room and the train. The medieval room was chock full of interesting information that would appeal to both children and adults. Thoroughly enjoyed our hours there and would highly recommend it. It does not look like much from the outside, but was excellent inside. The only negative comment is that I thought $12 was a lot for a child's entrance fee.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Xanadu4444
40,Medieval Olympics,"The day of our visit to the La Habra Children’s Museum happened to include an event with Medieval Times Restaurant knights and a princess! There was a swimming-noodle horse race, sword fighting between the knights and numerous opportunities to have pictures taken with the knights and the princess. The Museum itself is filled with many activities for young children to explore.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lenak63
50,Great day with my family,"Super fun and interactive way to enjoy old fashioned play...great for children's imagination they have several dress up areas they also have interactive learning areas as well as a beautiful park attached...Overall a fun and enjoyable day, the kids had a blast",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/360christik
50,Great for kids! Plenty to do!,"The La Habra children’s museum was pretty fantastic. It’s always great to have a place with so many activity options for kids! At $10/person it felt worth it, though if you want to go more regularly, I’d suggest the $80/year membership. Some highlights were the science room, the store, the lab... and MY personal favorite was the amazing taxidermy room! Unlike most taxidermy at museums, you’re encouraged to gently pet and touch them! It was a fun family day! I recommend going to the nearby Farrell’s Ice Cream for lunch after!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bostonsavatage
50,La Habra children's museum,"A perfect place for young children...probably preschool to fifth grade or 6th,. Lots of interactive projects to enjoy. Can pretend you are on a bus, shopping in a store, making a train work, viewing live stuffed animals of the woods, riding a old-fashioned merry go round, pretending drive a bus, etc. etc. Outside perfect place for a picnic, Close parking area, lots of animal sculptures in the front lawn area,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/purplenancy13
40,Tiny Gem in North Orange County,"Small quaint museum in Northern Orange County near the Civic Center. This place is small and great for young kids (8 and under). Lots of things for smaller children to see, touch and feel.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tonya2011
50,My day of exploring,"I stopped at the Children’s Museum today but only toured the outside of the museum. There are a couple of dinosaur sculptures, a butterfly sculpture, a train sculpture, some old rail cars, a caboose. Pretty neat to look at everything outside. Did not visit the inside of the museum (that’s for the kids).It was just fun to take pictures outside with the railroad cars and sculptures. The inside of the museum is probably pretty cool for the kids.Enjoyed my time there!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/119yvonnej
50,Hands On For Fun Learning,"With dinosaurs in the garden, a big wooden train to climb on, and little sculpture gems hidden in the hedges, the fun learning starts even before you go inside. The museum building is a 1920s-vintage railroad depot, and is loaded with hands-on activities. Kids can drive a bus, play math games, uncover fossils, get up close with stuffed wild animals, stage a play (complete with costumes), ride a carousel, and stay busy (and learning) for as long as you want to stay.We used to bring our kids here, and now bring our grand kids. The building and grounds are clean and well kept, the exhibits change frequently, the staff is friendly and knowledgeable, admission prices are super reasonable, and the museum is easy to get to, with abundant parking. Portola Park, next door, has ample shade trees and picnic tables. Well worth your time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnMacMurray
40,Children's Hands On Playground,This little gem in La Habra has hands on interactive activities for children. Mostly younger children and some grade school. They change themes and there's always something new to learn about.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Stntplr
50,First Time to Children's Museum of La Habra,"This was our first time with our grandchildren (ages 3 & 5) to the Children's Museum of La Habra. We arrived around 10:30 AM and stayed until closing time (5 PM)! We read the reviews and didn't expect to stay that long but the kids enjoyed it so much they went through everything several times. We also took one lunch and one afternoon snack break at the picnic tables next to the museum. This gave the kids a chance to see the dinosaurs, train, and run around outside. Our granddaughter, who is 5, finally got up the nerve to dress up and perform during the last hour of the day when it was less crowded. She was sad when it was time to go and wished she had the courage to try the theater room earlier. She did manage to learn the lighting and sound controls in the sound booth earlier when she was too shy to perform. They both enjoyed the room presented by STEAM even though there were only a few things they could do (beans, flying scarves, rolling a wooden ball down zigzagging PVC pipes). There were too many people in the room to try the 4th activity. We discovered this museum through Groupon. It was a great deal for 4 people ($20). We will definitely come back again and we would definitely recommend it to others. The staff are all very friendly and professional.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ca1842
40,Fun for little ones,The museum is always featuring new exhibits. I have been there with my own kids and on field trips with students I work with. The staff is friendly and helpful. If you have kids under 10 I would highly recommend taking a little trip to La Habra,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HelloAmyDawn
50,A day out with my Grandson,"My grandson loves this place, especially the Merry Go Round and digging for dinosaur bones. Always new things to learn.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kathrynmS1320OM
50,Great place for children,"I have a season pass and take my grandaughters regularly, they are 6 and 4, they love the museum. The museums changes their displays frequently. very clean.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mauricion307
50,Fun for the Littles!,"This is a delightful place for young children! Older kids, say 3rd-5th grade can attend, but I think it's geared more towards younger kids K-2nd, or even 3-4 year olds. There are permanent displays, like a stage & dress up area, grocery store & carousel. But there are also temporary displays that are educational, interactive, and fun! Great place to spend a couple of hours one afternoon!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/U5796JKpatriciap
40,Great Low-Traffic Spot for Kids,"The Kidseum is a great little spot to take kids of all ages. My 3 year old daughter loves it, there are areas for kids to learn as well as play, and the playground outside the museum is great too. You can find tons of butterflies on most days, and there is a huge butterfly mosaic along with dinosaur statues and footprints out front.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/N4964BSjamesd
50,Love this place for preschoolers.,I was there with two small children and I loved it. The rooms are small so your able to keep an eye on the children at all times. They had a blast in the bus. The stage room was the most fun for me. Watching them perform was great.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mslalo
40,"love the ""stuffed""animals and the bee display",Lots of fun without too much time commitment. My son liked the merry go round and the stuffed wild animals that you are allowed to touch! Even the body displays and dress up activities were fun for my 8 year old.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marymG3021HD
50,A Fun Place for Young Elementary School Children,"This is a great place for young elementary school children to visit. It is a very ""hands on"" experience with Science, History, and performing arts exhibits. Children can have a fun time either with their family or school group. The staff is very helpful to school groups. As a teacher visiting the museum with kindergarten and first grade classes, I really enjoyed the experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ruthg394
40,Great for Young Kids,"We literally live miles from La Habra Children's Museum but have never visited. We took our 5 year old and he loved it. We spent about 2.5 hours there just letting him explore and play, they have a ocean explore area, a real bus you can go inside, a play theater, train sets, wild animals and lots to play and learn. Best part of all you can touch everything and just let the kids play with each other and all the fun stuff there. I might consider joining the membership so we can take him often.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Andre2411
50,Oldie But Goodie,"Quaint and unusual and highly entertaining! Not your cookie cutter museum. Each room carries its own charm and you don't really know what to expect as you move from room to room. They have everything from a miniature carousel to a little insect exhibit you can walk through with a flashlight. Best suited for younger children ages 1-6. LHCM is also part of the passport program, so if you're visiting from out of state and belong to another participating museum, you can actually get free admission!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/991mackenziej
50,"La Habra Children""s Museum",took my grandchildren here and they were delighted to be able to go to a museum where they can actually touch stuff without some Docent disciplining them for trying to touch the exhibits,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/831alecw
50,Amazing!,My wife and daughter had the most amazing time here. I was busy at a conference and couldn't go but they have went a week ago and still haven't stopped talking about it. Our daughter is 11 months old and had such a great time. Highly recommended!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/517jaredn
40,Learning and Fun,"Great place for grandparents to take their younger grandchildren - you can share and watch the young ones learning as they meander through the museum -- it is not overwhelming for them, everything is there to stimulate their curiosity and coax their participation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L2435ZKbarbarah
30,nice little local place but don't expect big city amenities,not too much going here but friendly and small and perfect for a toddler…nice interactive activities for parents and grandparents to play with their toddlers…not a high flying overhyped circus here…just good friendly wholesome fare..highly recommend,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoeT327
30,Small,I thought this museum was really small. I could probably finish looking at everything in the museum in an hour or two. It might be fun for younger kids. They have alot of animals that were stuffed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/twogirlsandaboy
30,Young Children's Museum (Think 5 and under),"Somewhere between 3 and 4 stars, let's call it 3.4 and round down?This is a small and fairly inexpensive childrens' museum set in an old train depot which in and of itself is neat. They have an interesting toddler play area that has little cars they can ride and a few toys. Better is the area explaining bits about energy and water conservation though I think the message is a bit lost on the target audience.The hourly carousel ride is the most popular attraction which bridges the energy conservation room to the grocery shopping area and a bit of a construction and design type room which then leads to a model train area before giving way to a multicultural area and a room full of stuffed animals (not play toys - think like game trophy display type).As I said, it's small. It is a bit in need of a facelift as the toddler area was partially closed due to damage. It's a bit unclean if you take a closer look. There are some art making rooms but they didn't appeal to our toddler daughter; anther room is a ""dress up"" theatrical stage which didn't seem to appeal to anyone except for the errant mom wanting to get away from her kids for a moment to text and look at their phones... During rain, we couldn't see the old train which was a bummer for me.I'd go back, but it wouldn't be my first choice of activities in the Anaheim area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Danma11
50,A small treasure,"Don't let the humble exterior keep you from stopping in. For a very low admission price you can sit back and let your children of all ages learn at their own pace and unleash their creativity. Completely interactive and varied. Both my children and grandchildren enjoyed many hours there. Don'g miss touring the train outside. I've spent as many as 3 hours there with 2 young grandchildren, a great way to entertain them safely and inexpensively while they learn.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/403dignac
40,Nice,"This is a nice local place, with a great place to picnic, or have a young child's birthday. Also it can burn a lot of energy from the young one's, with their hands on things to do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pkkissell
50,Fun Place For Little Kids,"Great place for little kids. They have a real bus to pretend to drive, a mini carousal that runs every half hour and a real caboose for the kids to check out. This was my daughter's favorite museum out of the three we visited on our trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StacyCorbin
50,Grand ma's helper,"My grandchildren loved this place. We have been members for years. Great fun for the kids, parents and grand kids. Get an annual membership",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/153lillianm
50,So much fun for kids in such a small place,This is one of those places you can take elementary age midst over and over again. They change themes all the time and lots of hands on fun things to do. A must do if in La Habra.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/713kathyp
50,A Fun Morning or Afternoon,"Gem of a small children's museum, located in a park so you can add picnic or snacks and a little outdoor playtime. Great to while away an unbusy morning or afternoon!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/420maryanned
40,AGreat Place for Kids!,As a grandma I was always looking for interesting fun places to take my grandson. The LaHabra Kids Museum is the place. So many wonderful activities from toddler up to elemenetary school. It is fun for the kids but also very educational. You will find they will ask to go time and time again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Grandmaleslie
50,wonderful for kids AND adults,"i have taken my grandkids here since the oldest one (28) was young. not living close by i don't go as often but it is always a fun place to take kids. i used to have a year ticket and used it alot but not anymore so when i go i pay each time. love taking them and seeing how their imagination gets going. a must if one is in the area with kids.take a lunch as the outside is also inviting. they have some trains outside to walk around and look at, a small park to run off excess energy and there is a theater where they put on plays during the year at a reasonable price.with changing exhibits to keep one learning they really go the extra mile. the best (for me) was about 15 years ago of time at the turn of the century. made me remember my childhood with all the furniture and appliances that my moms aunts had at their houses! my daughter laid her newborn baby on one of the beds and people started to yell when she awoke as everyone thought she was a doll prop! they have a wonderful ""supermarket"" another granddaughter loved as i had one at home for her.fantastic place to go with kids of all ages as i have dragged my tweens there with the young ones and they have enjoyed it tho it killed them to admit it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/grabuela
40,Great Little Community Place for Kids,We recently took our daughter here partially because there were a few days of summer left and partially because we got to spend some time in some nice AC on one of these blazing days. I really wish that there were more children's museums like this. It's not super fancy but they have some great stuff there. It's so nice to be able to take your kid to a place where it's okay for them to run around and play with everything in sight. It's all community volunteers that are in their teens mostly but that's okay as the kids pretty much entertain themselves. Heck my wife even got me to put on a fireman's outfit. There is plenty of parking but probably not so much if there is a little league game. Outside you will find some smaller statues of dinosaurs and some restored rail cars. The museum gives tours of the caboose as well. We will definitely be coming back in a few months as they are closed this September to put in an Egyptian exhibit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CO151982
40,Interactive children's museum!,"The children's museum is a nice trip for families and schools. It is interactive; so, while they are having fun, kids are learning too. As the museum has a nice open park area, it's a great place to sit outside under the trees and have a relaxing lunch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DADouty
30,Not worth the drive,"If you live in Orange County and have heard about the La Habra Childrens' Museum, don't make a long trip to visit. It is not worth the ticket price or drive of more than 6 miles. It is somewhat of a staple here in La Habra for those who live here and know when to come visit on free days. I took my girls many years ago when they were elementary age. None of us were impressed. The museum is small, has not changed much and the ""adventure"" is over in a short amount of time. There just isn't that much to do or see unless you attend for a specific event.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/molly943
40,Fun for the little ones,"This is a great little museum tucked away in north Orange County. They have plenty for kids to do. My kids really enjoyed digging for fossils in the sand, riding the carousel, and dressing up in all the real firefighter gear.You can see the whole thing in just a few hours. Target sponsors the first Saturday of the month and they stagger entrance times to avoid overcrowding.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/USCarlos
40,My kids love coming here!,"We went a few weeks ago when it was free on Saturday. The place wasn't too crowded as they hand out wrist bands and let people in slowly. My children love going and seeing all the exhibits. They were also letting each child plant a flower inside of a toilet paper roll, it was so cute. We would def go back on a free Saturday but I am not sure if I would pay $28 for 4 people to get in on a normal business day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YumYuminWhittier
40,good children's museum for younger kids,"We have been to this children's museum several times over the past 10 years with our kids and have enjoyed it each time. Many different rooms and exhibits. My kids especially like the dress up room. We went this time with our kids ages 5, 7, and 10. Our 5 year old LOVED it. The 7 and 10 year olds were a bit bored after about 5-10 minutes in each room and they were too big to ride the carousel. So I would recommend it for kids ages 2-7. And if it's a CA school day, go in the afternoon to avoid the field trip groups!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DCP75
30,Good choices of fun things to do for kids,"I have been there with my 4 year old daugthter.There are some fun things to do such as pretending to be on a stage with lights and the microphone or drive a real bus. The merry go round is for youngers kids. There is a nice craft room where they can cut, paste and draw. The nicest room was the nature's one, real stuufed bears, a lion and a big moose. The room was though too small to appreciate them.The facility had a stroller parking outside, i was there with a eight month daughter too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ValentinaCalifornia
50,fun,great for the kids. lots to do for the little ones. staffed by volunteers so hours are limited altho during the summer the hours are extended.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/188RobertT
40,Inexpensive & great for kids to explore independently,"La Habra Children's Museum is free the first Saturday of the month - but if you do decide to pay it is only $7 per person. THe museum is small - but this allows the kids to explore independently.This is great for ages 2 to 7.The main exhibit changes every few months to give kids a new experience.They also have an art project each day and depending on when you are there they have face painting for free.If you have not gone, it is worth the trip. Mark it as a rainy day place to go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ALinCA5512
20,"Worse Childrens museum, i have ever been to.",I have been in the obe in the bay area and the one in miami and the one in pasadena. This museum is not up to par with the other ones. I am glad i went on a free day. Why so many good reviews? Maybe most of these reviews are from city workers. The best thing they had was the exotic animal show at 1:30 pm. I would go back and even pay to watch this show again. Fantastic for kids. But over all very pricey for what you get.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/liferiderone
50,Small and sweet,"This is s small but very sweet and nice Children's Museum. It has a lot of hands-on science, health, community based 'rooms' which allow you and your little ones to enjoy. It's a great place, however, they don't have a cafe/canteen/restaurants nearby, so bring your own snack or picnic in the front/ grass area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kitty-hello
50,Everything a children's musuem should be! Big and fun! Creative!,"This is a great children's museum! Space for kids to be creative! Huge theater room with stage and lots of costumes. Old train car outside kids can explore. Little carousel indoors that my 5 and 6 year old were excited to ride (included in admission). Art room that currently has interesting art history, but beyond young kids... Taxidermy room with an impressive collection of animals from around the world. Not only that, but the kids are allowed to pet them all! Very hands on museum! Things that can't be touched are behind glass...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dg_in_ca
50,Great for kids,"They have a FREE day on the first Saturday of the month. Parking is FREE.I took my 2 year old and it was very crowded. I would recommend going if it is your first time on a free day since there is nothing to loose, but for a more relaxed time go on a weekday.Things my 2 year old loved - Shadow box (I loved this too), trains (he loved pushing the buttons and seeing them go), the real and stuffed animals, and the bus.We took lunch with us and had it at the park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/socalpcktmemories
50,Theater Room Rocks,"My kids absolute favorite part of this museum is the theater room with literally hundreds of dress up costumes including shoes, hats and other accessories, a stage with a working microphone (the best part!!), and a working sound effects room.The merry-go-round is included in museum admission, but it only runs a couple of times an hour and only has about 5 animals to ride. The train tour is only open a couple of times a day too and is fun. They have craft or science activities throughout the day, but they sometimes run out of materials, which is disappointing when the kids see other kids walking around with something fun that isn't available anymore.The museum also has a separate toddler room, store, bus, model train, animal and nature area, instrument room, as well as a changing exhibit area. Kids can't stay off the dinosaurs in the garden outside the museum. Though we explored the other exhibits, I couldn't get my kids out of the theater room--they could have spent the entire day there.Note that parking is free, and that a decent playground is located behind the museum next to the parking lot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jebslg
