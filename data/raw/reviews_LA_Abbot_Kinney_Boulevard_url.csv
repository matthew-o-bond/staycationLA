30,A victim of its own success,"I discovered Abbott Kinney many years ago when its main street still had a mix of thrift and vintage stores, local coffee joints and surfy bars. Frank Gehry was doing his thing in Venice, and the Eames Office was still open in nearby Rose Street. Back then, you could really feel that this place still had the authenticity that was starting to disappear from LA's beach cities. Those quirky places are gone now - replaced by high end retailers and boutiques. The bars and restaurants have been scrubbed clean for the hordes of tourists that have discovered (and killed) whatever it was that made this place unique. If I could put a roof over the main street, this may as well be a high end mall. So, my visits have become less - opting instead to go further west on Lincoln where interesting shops are starting to pop up, or to DTLA where the artistic vibe is still exciting but edgy enough to stave off the total gentrification that has become synonymous with Abbott Kinney.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/reyledda

Time’s up on Abbot Kinney,"It was fun while it lasted but now Abbot Kinney Blvd is awash with the sort of people who wouldn’t have stepped foot in it just a few years ago.I’m sure they’re all lovely but it’s transformation has been sudden to dilettante visitor like me.Gone are the quirky and specialist thrift shops, the 1970s surf-boarders who tell a good yarn and the gloriously edgy cafes.Now it’s all about big money and the whole character has changed. For the worse. It reminded me of Bond St in London. Urgh.Mercifully there’s always Silver Lake which shows that LA can still do attitude.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/major_rawls

Lots of great shops and funky restaurants. Velvet, Sweaty Betty, Margaret O'Leary just to name a few great shops. Highly recommend!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NYgirltrappedinFL
30,Not So Hip,Abbot Kinney is meant to be one of the most hip streets in LA. In actual fact it’s a street full of would be hipsters and overrated cafes and restaurants.Several of the coffee shops eg Industry have wanky coffee offerings where coffee is individually blended.Novelty Alley!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sydneywanda

20,Just an overpriced outdoor mall now,"OK, got to be honest, years ago Abbot Kinney was unique with lots of oddball stores, interesting restaurants and other quirks. Then it was crowed one of the ""top shopping streets"" in the world, rents skyrocketed and all those places got pushed out. Today, some of the quaint beach-town architecture remains, but virtually all the stores occupying those buildings are owned by major global brands that can afford to pay ridiculous rents just to have a ""presence."" The traffic along the street has also gotten out of control.So, basically at this point it's mostly an expensive outdoor mall for high-priced brands. If that's your thing, you'll enjoy it. Otherwise, maybe you'll like laughing at the prices. Otherwise, it's harder and harder to find anything really special about what's here.If you look carefully, you can still see a handful of house/store fronts that exhibit the artistic quirkyness that it interesting before most of it was redesigned by corporate marketing departments. If you want to find the places where the current ""hip"" people are shopping, it isn't here anymore. Try Echo Park or Silverlake, maybe Eagle Rock.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelgO2056FX

There, food truck after food truck gathers to serve you tastes from around the world - and some tastes only found in LA. From lobster rolls and philly cheesesteaks to sushiritos and fusion tacos, every bite will be an experience. Bring a friend so you can split some meals - you'll want to try about 15 different courses. Most trucks take credit cards, but I always bring some cash in case.There are also great shops and restaurants during the day, and some art studios that I always end up finding my way into. The canals are close by, and the area is a little more local than the beach. If you can't make it on the first Friday of the month, but still need dinner, I recommend Abbot Pizza Co. for a great slice instead.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/432gabrielles

If you've been to Seattle, Portland, or any somewhat sizable city I can think of, you've seen most of these products/stores. It's a perfectly lovely street to go get a $186 pre-distressed sweatshirt (really - saw that), or what is probably a good slice of pizza, or a hand-made ice cream. I just can't figure out why it's a tourist destination. The neighborhood is lovely, the people were nice. We were staying nearby and enjoyed a couple of hours of wandering. It just wasn't remarkable enough to warrant a special trip. Unless, of course, you are from a very small town, in which case, please enjoy yourself and do not die of sticker shock.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmyOV

Walking the entire stretch both sides of the street was quite entertaining. Judging from the establishments and its patrons, one can surmise that it's a bit on the high-end side as compared to Venice. The neighborhood is actually nice. There is a wide variety of restaurants and bars to choose from- all hip and trendy. A haven for millennials and hipsters. This is one place I wouldn't mind hanging out every once in a while if only for the experience... and because I love to people watch.

In the 60's there were a couple of bars (one is still there) and some antique shops scattered among a few small homes. The area went down and then in the 80's starting to rise again with more shops and fairs during the summer when the street would be closed.It is now a wonderful place to visit. It is some of the best of Venice. Tourists are welcome and the locals are uber friendly and can direct you to food or drink. There is a great Gay bar there and it is okay for you to go, Gay or otherwise.You can sit outside of a few little places and have coffee and a muffin or lunch.You can spend the whole day there.

If you don't mind stepping into phone sized stores, then you will really get into the vibe of this part of LA.Abbott Kinney is a collection of old houses and stores retrofitted into shopping and dining. My favorite shop has been Zingara, which is a women's and children' fashion shop. Great vintage dresses for the bride and daughter. I love buying their woolen products for family Xmas gifts. Another new favorite is Happy Socks. They sell crazy socks which make my day a little happier.They have high end fashion items in these stretch of stores. Parking is extremely limited.

There is a large range (apart of hipster men walking little dogs) of unique clothes shops (not cheap) and very nice independent cafes and restaurants. I felt really comfortable wandering the shops along either side of the boulevard. Not everything is outrageously priced - I got a very nice unique fox print shirt for $99 and I'm 100% certain I won't see it anywhere else in the world.

40,Tough Parking and pricey but very cool,"AK has a vibe all its own. For example, you can spot the local men by the a) beard b) man bun and/or porkpie hat and c) small dog. Essentially, AK is a shopping/eating zone with Venice/SoCal flair. What's great is that for the most part there are no chain stores, it's mostly unique, eclectic shops. Like, the restaurants and coffee bars are great; it's hard to go wrong with almost any choice. My advice is that if you have the time do half of AK one day and the other half another day so it's more relaxed and you can have a great meal as a break. Lastly, do bring your credit cards.

30,Fun but expensive,"There are a lot of unique shops here. I would recommend a walk as the weather is awesome and there is a lot to see. However, most shops were really expensive. As an example, my daughter found some cute short-shorts. At a normal store I'd said they should cost $30- $50 since they were unique and of high quality. That said, they were $145. For shorts!

Boutiques, clothes and jewelry, hair salons, specialty shops, and again, a lot of great restaurants - all down one strip of road 4 blocks long. Kreations has fresh pressed juice selection to keep you rolling.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Clark54
50,A personal LA highlight,"As a lot of other reviewers mention, this is a 'hipster' street, with lots of great boutique shops and restaurants for teenagers through to people in their 30's/40's.I personally loved it and so did my partner and we spent hours weaving into and out of shops as well as the cafes and bars. The atmosphere is nice and the shops are great and original, it was finally what I had expected LA to be.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HSed22
40,Shopping,"I wasn't impressed, but my 15 and 21 year old daughters LOVED it! Very close to Venice Beach which is a lot of fun to walk and souvenir shop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D4525FHtonyb
40,Great for walking and window shopping (and eating),"Less than a mile from the ocean is a single street filled with expensive clothing shops, increasingly popular and delicious (but not inexpensive) restaurants and a growing number of coffee and juice shops. What's the big draw then - hip, cool people-watching, occasional celeb sighting, all dressed to impress in whatever is trending at the moment. If you can't get a table at any of the places on Abbot Kinney then you can wander over to nearby, up and coming Rose Ave where the restaurants aren's as crowded.On the weekends there are plenty of people wandering around with kids in strollers and toddlers - but there really isn't anything for kids to do on this street (except the ice cream shop).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/curious_tee
30,"Nice to walk through, but not to shop",I personally think the place is a little overrated but I had to go there because my girlfriend wanted to.Tons of hipsters on that street and the shops and boutiques are basically made for that group of people.The stores have some pretty interesting stuff to sell but most are completely overprized.We did have fun just walking around and looking at stuff but i probably won't go there again because it's just not my kind of spot to shop or hang out,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NormTRG
40,Dress up!,"Good grief - this is one of those places where I felt under-dressed just to walk down the street. There are a few places that are not crazy-expensive. We REALLY enjoyed ""Tortoise General Store"" which has incredible USEFUL products displayed in a museum-like space. It was the coolest place. Tom's has a ""roastery"" or some such thing, a very L.A. type place with people just hanging out on their laptops drinking their coffee drinks out on the back deck. We also enjoyed Sunya Currie which had reasonably priced gift items - scarves, jewelry, clothing, books, and very pleasant staff. There were other places with $700 pairs of shoes, and $300 scarves - WAYYYY over my budget, but fun, I guess, to browse.We found parking on the street at about 4:00, not sure how amazing that was, but maybe amazing for a tourist town.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tntcyclist
30,Nothing for families,Not a family friendly area. Overpriced boutiques and rude foreign tourists and locals. Some interesting architecture but that's it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dumptrumpco
40,Not to miss if your in this area,We walked from Santa Monica along the beach boulevard. It took about 30 minutes. It's a beautiful walk. Cute shops and adorable architecture. Great shopping for clothing! The stores are pricey but unique items. I loved the jewellery kiosks. Beautiful original stuff for a great price.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/4fortravel
50,What a great place to visit in the evening hours!,"I visited on the first Friday of the month looking for some shopping and grab a bit to eat. Boy was I surprised to find a bunch of food trucks everywhere! It turns out, the first Friday of the month is Food Truck Friday!! I nibbled my way up and won the blvd. I even tried some famous food trucks that were featured on the Food Network! What a treat! Besides the food indulgences, there were also lots of cute boutiques. No chain stores, just charming boutiques offering uniqueness. If you don't want food trucks, I cant imagine why, there are also lots of restaurants to choose from. I would suggest making reservations because in some places the line was out the door. Street parking could be an issue unless you get there early. I arrived around 4pm so I didn't have a problem. I also parked strategically so I minimized unnecessary walking. Not sure if there was paid parking available since I found free parking. I would recommend getting there earlier if you want to shop since most of the stores closed around 6-7pm. The food trucks were opening around 6pm. The restaurants were opened when I arrived around 4pm. So I would recommend, grab some truck grub, get something to drink, grab more grub, then have dinner in one of the restaurants! After all, it was a Friday nite!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/8umble8ee
40,Art shops and boutiques,"Had a good time strolling along the boulevard and stopping at the local art shops and boutiques along the way. If you like natural stones in jewelry, you have to check out Made in Earth, which was my favorite store. No chain stores on this street. We visited on a Thursday morning and had no problem finding a parking spot along the street, which was free 2 hour parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barnet38
40,Take a stroll down a unique street,"All the stores and restaurants along this strip are appealing for browsing and taking time to drink in the atmosphere. the shops aren't any of the chain store names you find in malls, but are unique with artsy crafts items that will allow you to find something unique for a gift or yourself",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robertaj740
50,The funky boutique shopper's MECCA!,"Loved everything about it! My adrenaline started pumping the minute we turned onto the street and there was a lineup of shops as far as the eye could see! lol. We had GPS'd the location, and parked at one end so we could work our way down the street. Unfortunately, it was our last day in town and it was a Sunday, so we didn't have enough time to REALLY canvas the area like we wanted to... but from the shops we DID hit... we were in heaven! LOVED LOVED LOVED it and can't wait to go back! We normally stay in West Hollywood when we visit the LA area, but I think I'm going to try the Santa Monica/Venice area next time for something a little different. There are SO many fun places to shop and eat... all with a little taste of local flavor... love the offbeat designers and casual atmosphere. I DID think some of the goods were a bit overpriced (and I'm not normally one to complain about price)... probably thinking they could justify it because of location?! I've seen similar items on etsy for FAR cheaper! Some designers though... their prices were well justified... and I just LOVED the boutiques!!! OH, and definitely opt to park in a paid parking lot w/an attendant (and don't leave purchase bags or luggage in your car!)... better safe than sorry... there are a LOT of ""interesting"" people wandering around ;)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/greenacres007
20,overrated,"Honestly, I didn't see the appeal. I imagined a street with more fun shops. We didn't try a restaurant. We walked the street, both sides, stopped into a couple of blahhh shops, and were done in half an hour. Not for us.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nancy34110
50,LOCAL FLAVOR,"Abbot Kinney has a lot of local flavor with art, local designers, lots of good food, interesting shops. Robert Downey Jr. owns a home on this street and I doubt when people walk past that they even know it's his home since the old homes on the street have all been turned into shops or offices, his place is more modern so I think most see it as an office space. It's a good spot for good food and a walk after.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelSecrets78
40,The trendiest strip in LA,"Snazzy up & happened area. You may want to flex your AM EX or window shop. I opted for the latter! High end independent boutiques, modern architecture butts up against old style beach cottages, funky cafes & achingly trendy design & 'concept' stores. All this makes for a fascinating walk down ""lifestyle' avenue. The hippies have left the house, the yuppies are thriving & the brands are stealthily marching in. A sign of the times?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SiAlLl
40,Very nice street!,"It's very nice street with some nice boutique shops on, some very overpriced! Definitely for the wealthy!Overall very nice and well worth a look at.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/immies2013
50,great walking street,"no chain stores, very bohemian retail choices, GREAT restaurants, good people watching, some movie star sightings (they live in the hood) excellent for gift buying",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janieB1123
50,The anti-mall shopping experience,"If you don't want to see chain stores or hear mall Muzak -- like almost all retail venues in L.A. -- then this is your place. Lots of funky little shops (not cheap) and good bars and restaurants. if you want to see how the legal medical marijuana market works in CA, walk into The Farmacy. You can't buy, but you can look.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bagan
40,Fun Browsing,Great shops for window shopping and finding that special thing. Lots and lots of fantastic eateries. We had brunch at Joe's which was excellent.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/calpoidog
30,Shops are neat but way too expensive!,The shops were nice and some were privately owned while others were chain stores. I found the shops to be very expensive and my kids and family were bored. It did have a community vibe and people were friendly. One review stated there were several food trucks. We only saw two. That was the highlight for the kids as they each ordered a special hotdog from the hotdog truck. There was also a very nice farmer's market a few miles away that we enjoyed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Seibs
50,Unique experience in LA,"Venice Beach is depressing. Santa Monica is touristy. Rodeo Drive is chi-chi. Abbott Kinney Boulevard is a stretch of independent, unique shops. Jewelry, vintage clothing, one-of-a-kind pieces all along one very walkable boulevard. Try the lemonade, have a stroll, and spend some time here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rachelmarilee
40,Come walk around,"Park the car and walk around the entire area here. Slip into a gallery or two, taste some wine and have lunch or dinner. A nice area to spend a day shopping and tasting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/livasida
50,Loved by Locals Like Me,"There are so many good restaurants here, and I do my Christmas shopping on this street for those individuals in my life that I REALLY love.Loved by tourists and locals alike",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/53HollyS53
50,Fun and great people watching,"Interesting, unique stores. Some of the best people watching in LA. Try the Tasting Kitchen restaurant.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelinSusan2010
50,FUN,WOW this was fun. Wandered all the stores and all the food trucks were out. Even cupcake truck. It was really the artistic district and fun for any tourist or native.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/saw55
40,The classy side of Venice,"Far from the madding crowds of Venice Beach is this great little shopping street with cool cafes, restaurants, bars, clothes shops and hairdressers. GTA is a particular highlight for me, with awesome pizza and cake. The clothes shops are very cool = very expensive. There is an amazing pop up designer clothes store there at the moment and if you are under a size US 4 you will love it! Spend a couple of hours down there, then go walk round the canals.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/moogharrison
50,Too cool for school,Über hip southern california ecosystem of beach meets beautiful intellectuals meets disposable incomes.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Here_in_SF
50,Best shopping street in Los Angeles,"This would be the best shopping street in Los Angeles.If your looking for a European bohemian worldly atmosphere (stores carrying the likes of Isabel Marant, Vanessa Bruno etc). The shopping, delicious food, G'linas a must & great people watching a little piece of downtown New York in LA. Newly opened boutique Flannel a highlight. Just read was voted by GQ best strip in America. Enjoy. I did!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LorraineA663
40,Fun way to spend the day,"Abbott Kinney has really changed in the last few years, with more small vintage shops, art galleries, and one-of-a-kind boutiques. It is a perfect place to find unusual gifts, or eclectic and artsy accessories for your home. It is fun to wander back and forth, and stop for lunch at one of the many wonderful restaurants along the way. The quality of the food has really arrived, with farmer's market produce and young and talented chefs. My favorites are Gjelina, Tasting Kitchen, and also, Joe's at the other end of the block. Parking sometimes can be a little tough, depending on time of day, but there are a few lots around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/winenutt
50,My favourite place,"This is no ordinary LA street. Like many shopping areas it offers a collection of designer shops, cafes, local shops and residencies. But it is all do-able on foot. The big feature is that it is incredibly creative from the architecture, the contents in the shops and the people. This is not just my favourite place in LA, but possibly the world.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/major_rawls
50,Abbot Kinney new it spot,"This area is full of quirky shops, boutiques, vintage surf clothes like Aviator Nation, and a number of cute gift shops. Very chic, very trendy, and full of character. Definitely worth taking a peek",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KellyD667
40,Great place to walk,"Interesting shops and good restaurants along the blvd.Had lunch at the French Cafe and Market, and sat on the outside deck with friends and our dog. If you are looking for hard to find French food products, this is the place.Overall, spent and enjoyable day walking along the street.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/346ernestf
40,"A fun, hip destination for shopping and eating","So much of LA is spread out across so many different areas,its always a relief to find a pocket of food, fashion, and general flair where you can actually wander up and down sidewalks for more than a few blocks in a row. Abbott Kinney has such a unique silhouette...low, one-story buildings, none of the glitz of Beverly Hills or even Santa Monica, but the restaurants and shops are a really exciting mix, not a dud in the bunch. The culture is young but not off-putting for anyone over 40, and a couple of the stores are truly exceptional - worth the drive from whatever part of the city you're in. Most tourists don't discover this little gem, preferring to stay in the more ""known"" areas, so it's very insider-ish in feeling, like Soho in the early 80's. I always make sure to cruise over there whenever I'm in LA - and during the week, street parking is generally easy to find.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Writerontherecord
40,Fun unique shops and restuarants,So many unique and interesting shops and great places to eat. Plus they have fun first friday with great food trucks.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/samwabs
40,"upscale,yet funky",Its a happening gentrified area-lots of interesting shops and restaurants,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mflickermd
50,Boutique Shops & Great Food,"Abbot Kinney is the best place in Venice Beach. Keep away from the madness of out of towners checking the scene on the boardwalk. This 1 mile stretch of boutique shops,art, trendy restaurants, and bars is a fun place to spend the day with the family! Lots to do and see. Street Parking and if you like Valet is offered in some places. The boulevard comes alive at night with music and bars, and what a beautiful scene. Leave the babies at home. Every first Friday of the month the shops open late and a parade of gourmet food trucks park and serve up feast like truffle potatoes on a stick, BBQ, Mexican Food, Greek Food, etc. COME HUNGRY!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/streaker3
50,"""Hippest "" street on the west side, to walk , dine and drink.","Many options, for shopping, dining and people watching. Go to Gjelena for the best over all food, Hal's for bar and food, Princeppsa for women's shopping and the Mystic Journey bookstore, for readings, candles and of course books!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/creativetravelor
50,A must see spot,"Love this street! Diverse, funky, stylish and tasty. Great hip young crowd, lots to see and try. One of my favorite places in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/887irynai
50,The Heart of Venice,"Abbot Kinney Blvd in Venice Beach is just a perfect example of the boho chic lifestyle Venice and Los Angeles provides. It has a vast array of shops, dining, and culture, all of which are excellent experiences.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/caitliwinx
