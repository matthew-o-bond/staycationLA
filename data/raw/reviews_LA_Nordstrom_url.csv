40,Nordstrom Cafe - Who Knew So Delish???,"Yes, I'm writing about lunch at the cafe on the 3rd floor - don't remember the name, but I remember the grilled panini and chicken salad. FANTASTIC! After shopping with a friend, we needed a quick bite before our next adventure. We asked a store clerk where to go and she assured us that the cafe upstairs in the store would be great - she was right! We know that the store will be closing down and relocating to the Century City mall - the server assured us that the menu would stay the same. Go there! Seriously - try it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christineess
20,Saddest Nordstrom Store Ever,Very limited selection of everything. The store is depressing. I love Nordstrom! We live in a state that doesn't have a Nordstrom so I was super excited. Such a disappointment. The staff was just standing around talking to each other and the selection of everything was so slim. The mall it's in is 3/4 empty. Depressing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R4280PXmonicap
50,Grilled Shrimp Salad!!!,You wouldn't think that a department store would have a good restaurant but they do!

Would highly recommend! Enjoy!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/talon951

50,6th and Pine,"Nordstrom Westside Pavillion has a great restaurant on the third floor. They serve a limited breakfast menu, full lunch and same for dinner. Each day they have a special; I recently enjoyed s roasted chicken with a thin pasta served with caramelized onions, spinach and cheese. This fish rivals those I've had in an expensive Italian restaurant. If you need to do some shopping and want a delicious bite, I highly recommend this place. Everything is fresh, salmon, tuna salad, soups, etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HappyUCLAretiree

I love it so much I am a Level 4 shopper, which means you get great perks like spa days or shopping parties with lunch or dinner for you and 5 friends.
