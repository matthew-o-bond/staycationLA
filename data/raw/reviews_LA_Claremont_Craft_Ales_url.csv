30,"Pretty crowded, no places for a small group to sit","Came in with my kids as we were in the area and I wanted to check out a local brewery. Kids got free fruit punch and they also shared a pop (soda). Beer was good. Great selection. We came in on a Saturday afternoon, and the place was quite busy. Many of the tables were reserved for functions so we didn't have anywhere to sit. I can't fault the brewery for being so popular on a Saturday afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JasonR542
50,Beers and beers,"If you want to take a beer and you're in Claremont, you surely need to go to the CCA! They have a lot of beers and a vast space to hang out with some friends, the prices are good, taps are around 5 dollars and they're delicious!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/diegokpu
50,Local Loves Beer,"This is a great craft brewery. The range of beers is such that there is something that will suit anyones tastes. I hate IPAs, because I don't need more bitterness. But I love the Jacaranda or many of the other beers here. You can get half kegs for parties and your friends will stay longer and admire you. I have been here many times and bought beer for parties. There is usually a food truck out front.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnnIreland19
50,Best Craft Beer Along the Foothills,"We have hit many craft breweries along the San Gabriel foothills, from Eagle Rock to Fontana. Claremont Craft Ales gets our vote for the Best and Favorite. There are a few reasons for this.SELECTION: 20 or so beers on tap, every time you come. Plenty of options for whatever you're feeling like.PRICE: rare to see a pint priced above $6. On the date I wrote this, 19 of 20 beers were that price. (Exception was the TIPA) Superb value, here.QUALITY: And this is why the ""best"" vote... We have not found a more consistent brewery. Just...always spot on great beer.I am gushing but they deserve it, here.Favorite brews: Carlisle English Pale, Baseline DIPA, 35 Miles Hazy, Pistil Pale.That's a pretty good flight, right there!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/randunethecat
50,Great vibe,Busy and welcoming tasting room. Extensive selection of beers and knowledgeable staff to help you pick your first...and second!Generally a food truck outside and a well thought out calendar of events.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/673PaulC
50,"Warm, welcoming and delicious beer","I came on a Sunday night, since one of the pastors at Claremont UCC was preaching there that evening. Itâ€™s a lively place, packed with people of all ages, lots of kids and lots of dogs. Some were playing bean bags on the patio and there was an excellent band (did not get their name).Love the place and love the beer.Be sure to check it out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/taz525
50,This is how beer is done in Claremont,First visit. Will be back. Great brewery tucked away off the main drag in Claremont. Atmosphere is great-- open and airy. Bartender was friendly and provided several tasters before making my selection. If you can't find an IPA here you like you don't like IPAs. Great offering. They now beer and how to serve it in an inviting atmosphere.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/icuski2
40,"Very ""Claremont-y"" Pub","This is the local pub for Claremontians, and their beer is tasty. The atmosphere is welcoming, and the staff remembers you when you return. My only wish is that they provided more seating as it is a VERY popular place to hang out on almost every night of the week.They don't serve food, but food trucks do make an appearance almost nightly, so you can get some grub from a truck--they get some pretty good food trucks, so you'll be pleased.They offer a large selection of beers with plenty of IPAs for those who crave the more ""hoppy"" beers. They also let you taste the beer before ordering, so I've been able to branch out to other flavors I might not have ordered otherwise.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mrs_Kenobi
40,Very good beer and pub atmosphere,"This pub is pretty much around the corner from us, but I have not been there for some time, having had a mediocre experience the first couple of times we went there. However, the place has changed a lot. It has expanded significantly, offers lots of seating inside and out, and works with food trucks/caterers to provide meals. More importantly, the number and variety of beers on tap is large, and the quality of the beer I had was improved over my first visits. The one downside I must mention is that the facility is in a warehouse location and so it is isolated from other establishments. But, of course, that makes their product more affordable and their prices are reasonable. Finally, even though the location is not acoustically designed, it was quite quiet compared to other similar pubs I have visited.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lorne29
40,Great neighborhood brewery,"So, before we get to the beer, CCA has done a great job of creating a pub atmosphere. They have loads of seating, even at their busy times you can usually find a spot. There are a variety of visiting food trucks with one there every open day. Events such as craft fair, yoga and others give variety and make this more of a destination.The beer is great with a good variety always on tap. Now there is a variety of bottled and canned also.Plus points: good atmosphere, great staff, good beer and a fun place to hang out.Go and try out the ""Jacaranda"" rye IPA: chances are you will also become a convert to this local fave!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/673PaulC
50,Great local true craft beer,"This is a Claremont gem. A great family run craft brewery with a well thought out and well crafted selection of beer, there is really one for any taste. The atmosphere of the tasting room is inviting and fun. The crowd seems to be people who are here to appreciate great beer. All the staff seem super friendly and passionate about beer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/832timb
30,Warehouse Brewery,"We stopped by on a saturday afternoon with 4 young kids to check out this brewery. It is located in a warehouse area off a parking lot. It has lots of outdoor area with versatile chairs that can be moved around to accommodate different size parties. It was packed when we got there but we were able to find room for 4 adults and the strollers. The location isn't great, it feels a bit like you are in a concrete jungle but it actually works pretty well for kids as long as they stay inside the roped off area and out of the parking lot just beyond. There are lots of kids and dogs so everyone is very friendly and patient.They have a ton of different beers to choose from which was fun. They do tasters of 6 beers. The staff I talked to was really friendly and helpful, even as I stood their staring at the beer list for a while trying to decide. The beer was all good but nothing amazed me. I think if I had one beer I thought was awesome I might have bumped the review up.They don't have food but they have food trucks which come regularly which seems to work pretty well. You can check out the food truck schedule online.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ScottF891
50,yoga and beer?,one of our favorite SoCal brewies because of the beers... many delicious beers and food trucks. they even have a yoga and beer session,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zactastic
50,Tasty beer and relaxed atmosphere,Stopped by one of my favorite craft breweries for a Double Dude and a game of sack toss. The beer is always good and the folks are super friendly.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HBrown131
50,Wonderful flights of beers,Love their Jacaranda beer. Dog friendly. Lots of seating compared to most of the breweries around here. Friendly workers,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Utvaca
30,Nice brewery - pretty good beer,"Fun brewery to stop and check out. Love the way they present a flight: tin box, use a dry erase board marker to write the name of the beer on the bottom of the tin. No food offered, but the beers were pretty good. Oh, and don't bring your favorite growler in and expect them to fill it. They can't fill growlers with any other brewery logo on it. Really?? It's a California law. Guess I need to buy a growler that just says ""Beer.""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/COLPeg
