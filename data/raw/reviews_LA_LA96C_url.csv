10,Wrong City,This is located in Los Angeles. Not in the city of Brentwood which is located 400 miles north near San Francisco. The neighborhood in LA called Brentwood is not a city. So-Cal locals often incorrectly refer to the wrong place when writing reviews for businesses located in this part of Los Angeles.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z9001AAjasonb
40,Abandoned Site but Beautiful,LA96C Nike Observation Post.We went all the way by Car. One could do small hike to the site. Nice to find Picnic Benches and clean Bathrooms up there. Tower (Observation) has about 60 Steps and is worth the climb. Children will enjoy it also. Abandoned site with beauty and history.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sorabh
