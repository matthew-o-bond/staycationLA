40,Great for little kids,"There's all sorts of stuff to do. There was a petting zoo as well as pony and camel rides (I honestly felt bad for the camel. He was just tied to a trailer in the sun). There was all the food you could possibly imagine - funnel cakes, popcorn, churros, smoothies, ice cream - plus all the restaurants in Old Town. They had a small ""farmers market"" section with organic fruits and veggies. Clothes, jewelry, vegan facial care products -- this is a must go event if you're in the area. But get there early (more than an hour) if you want even a chance at parking close to the event. There were people fighting over our spot as we left.",NotthatMelB
20,Arrive early to get parking,"I wish I could say I love the ""street fair"" as us locals call it. New management is slowly turning it around from the discount swap meet that it had morphed into over the last few years. Whether it can continue the movement back to its original quality artisans and crafters remains to be seen.",frazgo
