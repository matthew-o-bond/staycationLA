50,Excellent Charter and Instruction Company,"Easy to get to in the Marina del Rey area, about 15 minutes north of LAX. The staff is friendly and professional, and cares about the quality of instruction.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/510anissat
50,"Great skipper, easy booking, great boat, great afternoon!","Not cheap but everything was terrific so well worth it. We got a 34' jib and main, nice boat great condition, with Brian as our skipper for the afternoon. There were just three of us so plenty of room. Can easily fit more in the cabin and above. Was a bit choppier than usual and we had all taken Dramamine or similar so that was mostly under control and Brian was very attentive to aiming in less choppy directions even taking us around the very large marina to settle down. Apparently the weather is similar all the time so enjoy the wind(was around 15 knots) and sun and beautiful views of the coast and Pelicans swooping down for snacks. Wine, Saison beer, both in cans of course in case they fell, and cheese were just right for this 4 hour tour. Easy parking. We were able to steer and help with the sails-- whatever you are qualified and able to do. Brian even gave us local restaurant recommendations and I already tried one and it was exactly as billed (killer cafe... Check it out-- a NY style diner in LA). Would definitely do this again when in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RCHSTZ
50,Excellent,We had a great Caption: Dane. Thanks so much! We learned everything about sailing from a true professional,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TankPolak
50,Top of class,I have been coming to BlueWater for over two years. I personally can't say enough about the complete courses that are offered here. I have been through all the private classes that they offer and honestly the cost more than the multiple student classes but if you are looking for a ton of experience this is the class for you! Also they offer Weds evening racing classes that are a ton of fun and gives you a totally different view of sailing.I highly recommend BlueWater and hope you give them a shot!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/153stevenk
50,Fantastic,"Another couple, my husband, and I wanted to go sailing but none of us had any experience, we contacted Bluewater Sailing. They had many choices of boat sizes and skippers for most price ranges. We chose a 34' Catalina and a skipper for about $150 each.What a great time and great day. Chas (Charles) was our skipper and he was an expert. Everything he did made this one of our most wonderful days.Bluewater has a variety of boats, answers all questions, and sincerely wants their customers to love their experience. All of us would recommend this company again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/750KimM
50,ASA course 101,"I did the basic keelboat course for the American Sailing Association exam 101 and passed with 98%, thanks to my excellent tutor Bryan. I found the school to be pleasant, friendly and professional. Amy runs the office really well. I had not done any sailing before but I soon got into the swing of it, and after 3 days of private tuition, was able to take my Catalina 22 out into the open ocean with a crew of two all by myself (sticking to near the coast). It's a great feeling. The marina on Saturday is crowded with lots of boats so if you're a nervous first timer like me, then you might want to do the course on a weekday if you can do that. But then again, negotiating the boats is all part of the fun and you get to learn rights of way too. All in all, a thoroughly enjoyable experience and I wouldn't hesitate recommending Bluewater to anyone. Thanks Bryan, Amy and Elliot!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BilalP_12
50,Great overall experience,"A spur of the moment decision to take sailing classes over the Labor Day weekend led to one of the most fun and informative experiences I have had. Amy responded promptly to my email inquiry with a phone call and was very friendly and helpful in accommodating our last minute plans to join the beginners keelboat class. Neither of us had any experience in sailing, but had the desire to learn. We stopped by the day before the class and Elliot took the time to welcome us and recommend some good dining options, shopping, etc. I must admit I expected to get preliminary sailing instruction, but after three full days of classroom and intensive hands on sailing, I felt that I could understand and execute all the phases of sailing, from readying the boat, basic sailing maneuvers and the docking process. We sailed with a small 4 person group, one day with Elliot and two days with Brian. Both are excellent and patient instructors and they made sure each of us had experience in all the phases of sailing. Both of us passed the certification test. I am looking forward to returning for more instruction and some open sail time. Definitely opened my eyes to the exhilaration of sailing. Can't wait to return!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eileeno867
20,Never here again,"Elloit openly argued with one student in front of the rest of us and threatened we could only practice on buoys instead of real docks. A particularly attractive female was given priority and more time at the helm than the rest of us while he constistantly paid more attention to her. Of seven students, only two passed a written exam after the course. I attribute the abismal failure of more than 70 percent of the class to poor teaching skills.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bellancan6575n
50,Easy access to Santa Monica Bay and the Pacific Ocean,Sailed and raced sailboats there for 12 years. A mile and a half sail in harbor to clear breakwater at entrance to Marina del Rey.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Phineasfogg25
40,Great bareboat charter,"Small operation that took care of what I needed. Their boats are in good shape. People are friendly. We took a 4 hour private instruction because we had never been to Marina Del Ray and we were chartering a boat bigger than what we were used to. Martin, the instructor, was knowledgeable and a good instructor. The next day we chartered a boat for the day. All in all a great experience with this company. We will definitely return soon. Their website appears to not be updated, it is best to call them directly for information.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/My3KidsDad
30,Nice sailing school,"This is a small one man operation with a GM running the place, and most of the time a secretary minding the very small shabby office.I learned to sail here years ago. I have only taken private ASA lessons.Back then Peter the GM was a hard nosed perfectionist of a sailor and teacher.He was the business.Since he has left, the school seems to have lost a bit of it's luster.The new GM seems to be a nice guy and like Peter, he is the business. I have never taken a lesson from him.The teachers they still have are good sailors and teachers.The few boats I have used for my lessons I was not impressed with. A bit old and worn out.The small boats are located just 30 feet away from the office.The larger boats require a car ride to various locations of the marina.I have heard that their prices are a bit higher than the other schools.But the operation is small enough that everyone knows your name, free advice and help is easily found and offered which I find to my liking.Parking is limited.It's near a bike path and a strip mall is not far away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mdculpepper
50,The best!,After researching sailing schools for months i chose blue water and so glad i did! I did a few days of private and joined in the second part of a weekend class. Elliot was fantastic! As a rookie I was pretty nervous but he explained everything so well and was very patient with me. I realize now two months later and I am actually sailing how much he taught me. I look forward to going back for more advanced classes.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/456maureens
50,Back to the big ole blue,"We had not sailed in a few years, and it was our first opportunity to take our daughter out on a sailboat. We chartered a 32 foot Catalina, and it sailed beautifully. The staff at Blue Pacific was helpful, friendly and efficient. The boat was a great value for a full day of sailing, and all of the equipment was maintained perfectly. We will charter from them each time we return to Marina del Rey.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/austinfoodman
50,The best sailing course ever!,"I recently took a basic keelboat class at Bluewater Sailing in Marina del Rey, CA. I've had other sailing classes, but this one was by far the best ever. My instructors (two different ones during the two weekends of the course) were both very patient and very knowledgeable. The class was small: only 4 people, and this made it easy for the instructors to really give each of us some specialized instruction where needed. When I finished the course I felt confident that I was truly competent to take a sailboat out into the ocean.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/crinc
50,"Friendly, knowledgeable Sailing School in Marina del Rey","My family recently took sailing classes at Bluewater Sailing in Marina del Rey, CA (along the coast of Los Angeles). The experience was incredible, and our captain/instructor Peter Damisch was very knowledgeable.Thoroughly enjoyed it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Trail30605
