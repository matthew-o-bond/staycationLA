50,Nice canyon views and history,"Relatively easy hike that is maintained by the National Parks Service, provides nice canyon views and the foot traffic isn't too intense. You can also see the ruins of a famous house that was located here along with great waterfalls. Nice area to take a break along the highway.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DM_1278
40,Easy hike with great views and close to the beach,This is an easy hike that is family friendly with beautiful views. It is a short distance from the beach but is fairly secluded and has very different terrains. We enjoyed it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rmdanstrom
50,"Easy hike to Arch Digest ""ruins"" amidst the natural beauty of Malibu.","This is a relatively easy hike for families that will traverse the Keller Cabin, now burned down in the 1993 fire that dated back to 1800's. It was a one bedroom cabin that the Keller family, who owned much of Malibu in the 1800's before the more celebrated Rindge Family, had founded. At the end of the roughly 2 mile hike are the ruins of an Architectural Digest profiled home that straddled the stream. With the recent rains, the creek runs freely and you can still see the ruins of the living room concrete pad, chimney, and kitchen areas. Adventurous folk can boulder on above to find pools to soak in (not yet quite warm enough). The bouldering is best left for the agile, not little ones. Take a picnic, there are places to enjoy a respite.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/reyc632
50,A different perspective on Malibu,"I very much enjoyed hiking the Solstice Canyon trails, which include opportunities to see the ruins of buildings destroyed by forest fires, a waterfall, creek and views of the ocean (if you can manage the steepest part of the trails). I spent about two hours here, but you could easily spend more or less depending on your interest. The forest/mountain landscape is beautiful and most of the trail is paved.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KatrinaPa
40,Great hike.,"It was a good 3 miles easy hike. We wanted to see the waterfalls as advertised in the map but once we get there, it was almost non existent, very little. We took pictures with the rocks but not too impress by it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VPonthemove

50,Sunset Hike,"As the day comes to an end, there is nothing better than watching the sun go down from solstice canyon. Great trail steeped in lots o interesting facts about settlers from long ago.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Feefeet
50,Great hike! Cool burnt down mansion!,This is a great hike and really cool when you get to the end of it where a huge villa was lost in a fire. I love this hike!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnFallonstudio
50,Great hike rewarded with a view.. a bit of climbing... parking is a challenge!,"Love this hike... doesn't take a long time to do but it has great views, climbing, history, and well marked trails. Parking is a challenge if you are going during a popular time (weekends) so you may need to park before you get to the official parking lot or loop it looking for someone who is leaving. I think the parking eases up after lunchtime if you want to wait and go in the afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carrieul
40,Love hiking,"We love hiking, we hike at home and try to search out hikes whilst on holidays, especially when great views are involved. This was not a favourite and there definitely needs to be more signage. Easy to walk more miles than necessary if you are just winging it. My advice take the sunset trail right at the beginning, Do the loop, enjoy the waterfall and head out. Not a lot of reward, views are just ok, really a good exercise trail and not much more. We went on a busy day and there were way too many dogs for my liking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/965ashleighm
50,In Awe with the nature at Solstice Canyon,"Solstice Canyon is a park within the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area in Malibu, California. Just a mile east of Point Dume (See my review on Point Dume Beach). We went there for being one of the 7 hunted hiking trails in Los Angeles, try to catch the ghost, instead, we were breathtaking by the stunning view of the nature!!Maybe you will have better luck run into the ghost, it was said: ""Some hikers report sightings of a beaten woman that burned in that fire and now haunts it. Her cries and wailing are said to cause extreme pain in the crown of your head. You can sometimes smell burnt human flesh according to freaked out hikers.""Have fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SheenaGao
50,Great place to hike,It was a beautiful easy hike. The path we chose made it about a 3.5 mile hike. I was surprised to see that there was a waterfall but when we got there it wasn't quite a waterfall. It was found in a pretty setting. There was a bit of an incline but nothing anyone couldn’t do at their own pace. A few noteworthy things in case you’re wondering: there are restrooms at the entrance and parking was tough. If the lot at entrance is full park along the street or at the turnabout a little ways down.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pbearfox
50,Hot hike in the fall,"This is a nice and easy hike if you pick the right time of day. If you hike it during the heat of the day, be prepared with plenty of water. Even though it was one of the hottest days of the year, it was still an enjoyable hike.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/willkommenhof
50,Beautiful from Kansas folk,"A very beautiful morning hike. A great workout and worth hiking the hill to find a beautiful view of malibu and the Pacific Ocean. Take the full trail around, it's gorgeous. Don't forget water and please leave NO TRACE and pick up any trash another might have left. Too beautiful not to.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/debs476
50,Great place to explore,"We had a lovely hike with a family of 7 with boys from 3 to 7 their mom and grandparents. Lots of places to go off trail and not get lost.

20,"too many people, a freak'n zoo","This used to be a tranquil place to walk, but too many people and nothing tranquil anymore! If you don't care about the crowds, the back of the canyon has some pretty waterfalls, but every rock has a human on it, so good luck trying to get a nature shot on a weekend!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kellyp400
40,Great walk bring water,"We did the entire trail loop. Went up and saw the waterfall, it was smaller than we expected but kids liked it.On the way down we took the rising sun junction of the trail, which will take you to higher elevations first then drops. At that point will see nice views of the ocean.Make sure you have enough water, we got there a little late, around 12:30 pm. We our two young boys with us 7 and 10 years old so light snacks and water came in handy and no complaints. Suggest at least on 16 oz water bottle per person.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/221khaleda

50,Amazing Hike,"We love this hike.. we have done it about 14 times now and we think it is a gem... the path is beautiful, following a mountain stream up to the remains of a mansion that burned down in the early 1970's... there is also a beautiful waterfall above the mansion that is fun to explore... we loved the flowers, the lizards, the wildlife, my kids love this hike!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/334kristianj

50,Amazing easy hike with outstanding views,"I did this hike for a nice cool down after the LA marathon (yes, it is easy). The parking lot was full but I was able to find a space not far from the entrance.The longest hike took me about 3 hours walking (very) slowly with photos of Malibu included. HIGHLY recommended for those who enjoy a good view and don't mind breaking a sweat.One thing: bring lots of water.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/damaninnyc
40,Beautiful,"Very nice hike through the Santa Monica mountains. My husband and I hiked here with our dog. My only complaint, is the amount of dogs that were off the leash, just because your dog is comfortable approaching other dogs, doesn't mean that my dog is comfortable being approached. There are signs posted throughout the recreational area and on the trails to keep your dog on the leash, however, no one seems too concerned. The views were very nice, with many spots to overlook and take a rest. I would definitely return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shawntel39
40,Easy hike defining old Malibu,"The Solstice Canyon area and hike is a relatively simple hike, partially on an old paved road (off-limits to cars) for part of the way and a wide path up to an architetural digest home in the '60's that burned in one of the wildfires. Its foundation, pad area, and fireplace still stand, as well as an old, small lock to regulate the stream flow. Add to that, a stream runs through it, right through the home with some gentle waterfalls. Not much water now due to the drought but more fun to see when compared to Escondido Falls. You can continue bouldering beyond the razed home, along the stream as well for more adventure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/reyc632
50,Great Hiking Experience,"Solstice Canyon offers some excellent hikes with stunning views and a good dose of history through the scattered ruins. We hiked the relatively easy trail with our infant son in a front pack though previously I've hiked the longer loop that runs up along the ridge which is more strenuous, though more rewarding in the views. Just watch out for rattle snakes (saw my first one here)!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cliffhanger202
40,Great view of part of Solstice Canyon..,We rented a house that had a beautiful partial view of Solstice Canyon and a full view of the Pacific Ocean from the front of the house.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jooksandoy
50,"Solstice in the morning, zuma in the afternoon","I had a great time here with my brother and his girlfriend. We parked at the second larger parking lot closer to the trailhead. We went on the solstice canyon trail up to robert's ranch house. The ruins of the house were interesting and the waterfall was kind of just a drippy puddle. Still enjoyed it. We took the rising sun trail back. Definitely the highlight! While it was a good amount of uphill trekking with mountain scenery, we were rewarded with beautiful views of Malibu beaches on the downhill.I would say this is a very do-able hike if you are in shape. My brother and his girlfriend are from NYC so they walk everywhere and I workout regularly. It was mildly to moderately strenuous but I am not sore the next day.Definitely bring sunscreen and 1-2L of water per person!We finished our hike by hopping over to zuma beach for a swim which felt excellent after the sunny and dry hike.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/74nadias
30,Nice hike,"We went hiking in the afternoon which was really nice (solstice canyon trail). The views are amazing and we saw several types of wildlife (birds, bees, deer, etc.). The hike we took wasn't too difficult and had some historical structures to view on the way to a waterfall (that we pretty much dry due to the drought). There were a lot of interesting trees too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanielleP378
40,Nice walk,"Nice easy walk, lots of families and dogs for a relatively isolated walk. Bring lots of water and avoid the restrooms The loop trail is not worth the effort",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F8233INscottc
50,Great mountainous views,"My sister and I did the main trail, part of the extended portion, and the Rising Sun trail. The views were great and the first half of the hike was very easy going. The Rising Sun trail was the hardest of the ones we hiked, but it was still manageable for us. I highly recommend this park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ludkem
40,Great hike with good views with effort,"We started on an easy trail to old houses that burned down. This was on partially wide trail through some woods so partially shaded. Lots of birds to see. We then proceeded on the rising sun trail which was somewhat demanding (not for small kids or those not in shape). Once you get to top there is a great view of water. If you go mid-day, take water because it can get hot and be careful with taking dogs because not much shade on this part. there is spring for the dogs to drink from at the old houses. By the parking lot there is water fountain and pit toilets.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mwc104
30,Easy hike,"In our group of 4 were 2 marathon runners who were going to run the LA Marathon the next day so they didn't want to take a long hike. This is a very easy hike, in fact, most of it is paved so lots of people were pushing strollers. The waterfall at the end was very disappointing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LynnMcC17
40,"Fun hike, not too hard, nice facilities and a waterfall",The basic hike to the waterfall is moderately flat and shaded. The waterfall is small but it runs year around (very rare find) and is pretty although the railing around it is a little unsightly.There are connecting trails that go up the canyon sides so you can hike for quite a while. Those are steeper and more open.If you're a southern California hiker this should certainly be on your list. It had pretty high appeal for moderate exertion.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/_MTJ_99
50,great hikes with wonderful views,You can experience short or long hikes throughout the canyons of Malibu. You can see the water and the beach from many vantage points.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DougANWA

40,One of the best hikes in Southern California,"I'm really reluctant to tell everyone how good this park is because I don't want it to become even more crowded than it already is. Just be sure to hike all the way to the back of the Canyon, to see the old home site and year-round waterfall.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Newsdoc
40,A hiker's dream.,"Sokstice Canyon is just off Pacific Coast Highway and Corral Canyon Road. Great for hiking in the hills of the Santa Monica mountains. Just be careful of the wildlife. There are rattlesnake, deer, coyotes, spiders and more back there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LetsGetOut
40,Not Exactly a waterfall,"This was an easy, beautiful hike, which is exactly what I wanted. But with the drought, the waterfall was quite a disappointment. But it was a great short hike, not too steep, not too difficult. Decent trail.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Repbeth1
50,Go to the top for some spectacular views,"I came for a nice morning easy hike and then decided to make it tougher. First, it's not hard to find at all - just off the PCH at the 76 gas station. There are two parking lots, the first one is small, keep going as the second lot is bigger and right at the trailhead.The first part of the trail is a easy out and back to a burned down mansion and waterfall (barely a trickle). This part is well shaded. After doing that, I had more energy and decided to do the Deer Valley loop. You begin up a moderate rise. Getting close to the ridge line and having some great views. I got sort of lost as the trails are well maintained but not well marked. I got to the end of the trail, high above the valley with a spectacular view of the ocean!! Turned around and headed back. In all I hiked 7 miles. Some pretty difficult uphill stretches. Not the terrain, but the length of the uphill climbs.I would definitely do it again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CraigS789
40,Daughter 3 went.,Enjoyed the hiking but difficult uphill terrain. Beautiful scenery. Waterfall was ok. Nice spot to eat picknic.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/badbaruch57
30,The waterfall is a trickle as of summer 2015,"I know - there's a major drought in California right now. But just to confirm, this walk has been quite badly effected. The scenery is pretty scorched and the waterfall is a trickle. To get the best of it, take the high path out so you get the (still striking) views from the top of the hills out towards the sea, then take the walk back on the lower path, along the (pretty dry) river bed. Still enjoyable, for all that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MicheleM343
50,Great morning hike!,"My husband, 18 year old son, and I did a morning hike up Solstice Canyon. It's uphill mostly as we did the trail to the waterfall. Don't get to excited about the waterfall since the lake of rain in California this summer has turned the waterfall into more of a trickle of water...falling. But the views were pleasant and the trail is mostly paved so you could jog (uphill) or push a baby stroller. It's obviously downhill the second 1/2. I would say it was approximately 2 miles round trip and perfect for the beginner.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rx1987
40,Solstice Canyon + Rising Sun,"Solstice Canyon trail is an easy 2 mile round trip hike to the ruins of Roberts Ranch and a small waterfall. If you're up for a little challenge, take the Solstice Canyon trail until you get to the waterfall (about a mile). Then, instead of going back the same way, head to the Rising Sun Trail which starts out with a strenuous climb through stairs and uphill loops. Once you get to the top, you're rewarded with spectacular canyon and ocean views. The rest of the hike then becomes much easier.To avoid crowds, go in the afternoon but be prepared for the heat and long stretches without any shade. Detailed information and maps are available at the Santa Monica NRA King Gillette Visitor Center.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marjbq
50,Great hike to a waterfall,Best to visit after a rainfall so the waterfall is pumping out . Crawl or climb up to other levels behind the first fall and there are a few secluded pools.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tom734
50,Solstice Canyon.,Beautiful hiking trail providing good exercise. Can hike to the waterfall and maybe the water will be running. You will hike by nice streams and huge trees along the way and then you can take another trail off to the right and climb up lots of steps which is strenuous but then you will be at the top and can hike the ridge-line with beautiful views and get back to the parking lot.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/268se
50,Nice short hike,"My friend and I were looking for an activity in Malibu before heading to lunch. We did this nice easy 2 mile hike and got to enjoy the serenity of the canyon as well as the interesting history of the 2 houses that had been built there and unfortunately burnt down several years back. Despite the incredible drought, the waterfall did have a bit of water coming from it. It was definitely more than a trickle and a nice place to pause before heading back out. There are several longer hikes here as well, but this was exactly what we were looking for. A great day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/525kellya

40,Great for an Easy or Beginners' Hike,"An easy hike for beginners and lazy weekends. Parking available but hard to get on weekends so you may have to park on the road or a mile away from main entrance. Dogs on leash allowed but found some abusers not picking up after. Great for smal kids as well as I see families on the hike. On certain time of the year or if drought lessen, small waterfall could be seen at the turnabout point of the hike.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/asyeo
50,Beautiful short easy hike with interesting stops.,"Solstice Canyon is one beautiful hike in Malibu, California. It is a busy hike so you have to know where to park during the weekends, there is parking on the road outside of the park so it is busy but worth the effort. Can you believe there is a year round waterfall on this hike, it is the short hike but worth seeing. You may have to climb some boulders to get the best vantage points. There are also two historical Malibu homes built in early 1900's that were mostly destroyed in fire with the frame still intact. It is a cool stop along the hike. A creek winds through the entire hike, so you hear the water as it flows down to the sea. The water fall is a gorgeous stop, with some rock climbing over boulders. I recommending hiking in the fall & winter during cooler temperatures, and less people traffic. It is a gorgeous hike, great for beginners.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/651CathyA

I wish there was even more of the history posted and trail markers. The view was spectacular.We tried to bring our small children, 3 and 6, and it was too much for them to get to the ruins. If they were a little bit older it would be great because they would love to check it out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JCKelsey

40,Excellent off the beaten path spot,"We really enjoyed this; it's so close to the hustle and bustle of the PCH, yet it feels miles away. Great views of mountains and homes in the distance, nice sojourn with nature. Paved trail at first, then it becomes a dirt path with mild inclines. Amazing how it can be quite a bit warmer than by the ocean only a couple miles away. Reminds me of a short hike back East, with the exception of surrounding mountains. Recommend this excursion for individuals, couples or families that want some good exercise without wearing you out. Plenty of shade and small creeks along the trails.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WarrenB07481

50,Great hike close to Malibu,We did this hike this past weekend. We took the harder route up the ridges and down into the canyon. This was a great workout with great views of the ocean and the ruins at the end of the hike were very interesting. Take the time to walk around the ruins and try to imagine what it was like. Scramble to the falls in the back right side of the house. Free parking with bathrooms are a bonus. It was a warm 80 degree day but there was a nice breeze to cool us off. Bring lots of water as most of the hike is in full sun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/me1300n

There was very little to see, and a lot of walking up the side of a hill in blasted landscape with the sun beating down. Even in 75 degree weather at the shore, it is 90 degrees on the trail. The 'waterfall' is a ribbon of water flowing down rocks. The water doesn't actually fall from anything. The 'ruins' - Roberts house - is a building from the 1950s that burned in 1982. One is left wondering why no one cleaned up the remains of the building so that trees could grow. It would be a mistake for anyone to make a pet dog suffer through this hike. There is the constant sound of snakes slithering around on the side of the trail, and hardly any shade. The parking lot is the prettiest part of the trail.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/frequentflier77
50,"Excellent, peaceful climb/workout","I went to Solstice Canyon on a peaceful sunny Sunday afternoon, and it was the best hike I've done in awhile.First to get there, head north on PCH, past Malibu Seafood on your right, and another right at Corral Canyon Rd. There will be a '76' gas station at the corner, so that'll be your landmark.Passing through the one way lane, you'll end up at the parking lot. There are bathrooms and maps for your convenience.All paths/trails will intersect each other along the way, but the best one is the trail right off the parking lot. It's an easy & brisk 2.1 miles, and you'll discover a pleasant waterfall up top (past a burnt house).I'm saying it's easy because it is paved, but there will be a couple of instances where you'll have to cross a stream via rocks.Taking another trail past the waterfall, you'll be climbing up to go back down. It is the best trail, in my opinion...for the views at the top, and for catching your breath during the great descent.On top of having a break from the city life, having a great work-out, all of this is FREE!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AndrewMichael
50,Hike up Solstice Canyon,"I went to Solstice Canyon in July 2002, while i was saying in L.A with a friend. The hike to the ranch house which was destroyed by fire. My friends a i climbed over the rocks which are either side of the river, while doing so we saw a snake, which scared us a bit. The hike was good fun, but not too chalenging.",
