50,A must for a Roller Coaster Fan,"If you are for Roller Coasters and great fun just forget all about Disney and visit this blazing place just north of LA. Enjoy the biggest loop in the World or try to avoid getting wet when you visit the River rafting - a hint, take the second seat to the left when entering the raft :o)",Carsten Kjær J
50,Always tons of fun,"I've been going to Magic Mountain off and on my whole life and always have a great time. I miss some of the old rides they've gotten rid of but also been enjoying the new. I miss Deja Vu, but quite enjoyed West Coast Racers. X2 and Tatsu are my top faves in the park. Twisted Colossus was a new one that I enjoyed but didn't think was worth the long wait time. Highly recommend heading to those three rides early or late in the day to avoid long lines.",EmBentley
50,redefines thrill!,"Simply spectacular. Makes places like Universal Studios look like child’s play. The quality of the rides are excellent, particularly those labeled “max thrill”. My friends and I beelined for the extreme ones, and were left gasping at every turn.Each ride has its individual flavour, and own surprise to offer. My personal favourites were X2, Tatsu, Riddler’s Revenge, and Full Throttle, but then again those are the standout ones. I especially like the diversity offered. On some rides we were standing, some we were inverted such that we were in a flying position, and in more others our legs were dangling precariously. On some drops it felt like our souls were leaving our bodies.We got a one-day meal package (USD$37.99), which allowed us to pick from a limited selection of food for lunch and dinner. The food was mediocre and of course pricey. It did come with unlimited refills of soda, however. I wouldn’t say it was that worth it.We came on an off-peak day - weekday, first week of March. In the terms of the website we checked (a quick Google search will pull up the predicted crowd level), the park was a “ghost town”. That meant that most eateries and miscellaneous activities were shut, but most rides were functioning as usual. We spent at most 15 minutes queuing for any ride.Traveller tips: before planning the date of visit, search for the predicted crowd level online. Go onto the official Six Flags website to purchase your tickets and parking, and meal package (if you like) in advance. They also offer discounts for residents in certain parts of California (postal codes 90000 and above), so be sure to enter yours when prompted. Also, they offer lockers at all rides with rental for a dollar, but there’s no need to use them because you can place them at a storage corner beside the rollercoaster.",gwynethtyt
50,Great Family Fun!,There is something for everyone here! With a membership you save tons of money! We love the rides games and food!,Hillary R
50,Great fun visit,"Had a wonderful day, friendly welcoming staff from entering the park to staff running the rides. The rides well maintained and most ran during our visit. Discounted ticket as not season so rides easily accessible although not all running. The eight rides we did all worked well and are great fun.",Steven W
40,Prepare to walk. A lot.,"While this is one of the most out of the way parks for those of us nearer to San Diego, if you care at all about big time thrill rides, this is most definitely the place to go. Huge variety of coasters, both old and new, and definitely one of the most iconic places to go for their coaster lineup. Not wholly walkable if you are out of shape since there is no real transport around to the park's various areas, but if you are an enthusiast, this is most definitely a place to go to get a great number of wonderful rides, and some icons that may change within a few years time.Definitely eat outside of the park if you can help it, though. Their prices for food in the park are a T O T A L ripoff. And its just standard fare as far as food and drinks go, so its not like you are missing out on much at all, food wise. The selection of merchandise is pretty big, of course, as the Six Flags parks are across the country and encompass a large number of rides and attractions.I didn't explore too far into the children's side of the park, though I know there is one, but I think overall that if you wanted to go somewhere with your younger party members, I would recommend Disneyland or even Knott's Berry Farm over Six Flags Magic Mountain. This park's definitely more geared towards the thrill seekers over family amusements from all I have seen.",MichaelComeau94
40,A Guide to Six Flags from a Ride Junkie,"EXTRA! EXTRA! READ ALL ABOUT IT! All you need to know about Six Flags' Magic Mountain!Table of Contents:- Season Pass vs Daily Tickets- Ride Reviews- Fright Fest: Worth It?- Misc: Tips and Tricks (Save Time + Money!)------------Season Pass or Nah?--------If you plan on visiting Six Flags at least 2 times during a year, a season pass is well worth your money due to the benefits including: unlimited visits to the park (up to $93/visit ), free parking ($30/car), and Bring a Friend Free days. Additionally, you can visit ANY Six Flags park in the world for free.Fortunately, I was able to scoop my Six Flags Season Pass during their Labor Day sale for $58+tax (70% off!). Benefits includes: upgrade to Gold Season Pass, free ride picture, free skip the line pass, admission to rest of 2019 and all of 2020. I recommend purchasing your season passes near Labor Day since that's when the discounts are largest and upgrades are available.Memberships are slightly more expensive and offer more discounts for food and merchandise. There are different tiers, with increasing levels of discounts. I wouldn't recommend these unless you love repping the Six Flags brand.------------RIDE REVIEWS------------MUST-GO:- Twisted Colossus (5/5)- X2 (5/5)- Tatsu (5/5)- Full Throttle (4/5) - only if the wait is less than an hour though. This ride is like 45 seconds long.- Apocalypse (4/5)- a really nice wooden coaster- Crazanity (4/5)JUST OKAY (not worth a wait over 45 min):- Goliath (3/5): after the big drop, it's just okay- Lex Luther (3/5)- Scream (3/5)- Viper (3/5)- The New Revolution (2.5/5)- Gold Rusher (2.5/5): a kids ride that's more fun in the back- Justice League (2.5/5) Battle for MetropolisNOPE (ride only if it's less than 10 min wait):- Batman the Ride (2/5)- The Riddler's Revenge (2/5)- Wonder Woman Lasso of Truth (1/5): barf central.----------FRIGHT FEST-----------I went on Fright Fest 2019 and it was pretty freaking good. If you already have a season pass, I do think it's worth it for you to spend an extra $20 to get the experience at least once. The whole park is well decorated and the mazes were fantastically spooky.----------MISCELLANEOUS----------LOCKERS: Luckily, they are pretty lax on this policy regardless of the signs. The only time I needed to purchase a locker was on X2. Otherwise, every other ride allows you to stash your items on the side. Save your dollar bills and don't purchase an all day locker pass. It's not worth it!START ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE PARK. There's two reasons for this. (1) All the best rides are on the left side (2) the walking experience is better. If you start on the right side, you'll be faced with a very hefty uphill that's very tiring to get through.If you do follow my advice, head straight for X2 because this is the first ride that reaches a 1-2 hour wait time regardless of whether it's off season or not. Next, I'd go to Tatsu which is right next door.",Jules

50,Thrill Seekers' Utopia,"Six Flags Magic Mountain has been my favorite theme park because I'm a rollercoaster fanatic! They once held the record for the most rollercoasters in a single park but I think they've since lost it. It's been a few years but what memories... Your excitement builds as you approach the park and see the numerous tubes of colorful steel rising above the tree line.I could've strangled my accompanying friend as he accidentally brought along a Swiss Army knife in his backpack and he didn't trust leaving it with the security office. I'm like ""just throw that ***t away, I wanna go in!"" He eventually succumbed. Another thing I love about the park is that it's not filled with little kids like Disneyland.PERSONAL FAVORITES:Revolution - Its claim to fame was its vertical 360-degree loop. Other than that, nothing really special about this ride. It's still in operation with a new name ""The New Revolution"".Log Jammer - While not as uniquely-themed like the version at Knott's Berry Farm, I still enjoyed it as I love water rides. This ride is long gone.Colossus - An all-wood structure with steel wheels on steel track was the ultimate coaster experience. Noisy and rough-riding with big dips. Dual tracks made for a race-like experience. It has been retrofitted to be a steel coaster and renamed ""Twisted Colossus"".Ninja - What makes this suspended coaster fun is that the carts sway freely, even whiplash-like when going around bends.Viper - As far as fun-factor, this is the best coaster (IMO) in the park as it's fast with corkscrews and loops.Roaring Rapids - 12 passengers, a big circular raft, rapids and waterfalls. Some got soaking wet!Batman: The Ride - Suspended, floor-less, inverted coaster. Your feet are dangling so it feels like you're in a chair flying through the air. Having no floor screws with your peripherals especially with the numerous upside down moments.Superman: The Escape - Ever went 0-100 mph in seven seconds? Damn, this was insane. A small cart shoots you up a vertical track to meet the caped-crusader at the top.Riddler's Revenge - My first standup coaster experience. Unnerving and so much fun with it's g-forces, banks and loops.Deja Vu - You start by being pulled backwards up a vertical track before being dropped, roaring through the station at full-speed, into some twist and turns, pulled straight up a vertical track again then fall back down. Genius!Scream - The platform drops from under you before the ride takes off. Another floor-less coaster similar to Batman: The Ride. Not the greatest but I did buy a t-shirt, LOL.Goliath - While this beast lacks going upside down, its drop height (255' after ascending), is mind-blowing as you head full force into a tiny covered tunnel at the bottom, making you feel like you're about to be decapitated. The g-forces are mean!X - I was freakin' bummed, disappointed, sad and pissed as this was not operating when we were here. Not sure if it was broken but it was enn-eh. Ugh. Was so looking forward to my 4-dimensional coaster ride.OVERALL:I need to get back to Valencia. I hope my older body can still handle it. Only one way to find out!",MauiWorldTravelers
40,"Some good rides, tired feeling park, and sold out of date Picture Pass","There are some good three rides here, probably more than you can complete in a day. When we visited the queue lengths weren't too bad, and we got through then fairly quickly. (End Jan 20)However, the Picture Pass didn't work. We bought it at the same time as the park tickets, it was their add-on, but when we visited it had expired. (Unused.)The initial response from the Picture Pass desk, and Guest Relations, was it's expired and the don't provide refunds. They initially didn't understand they had sold me something which couldn't be used!!!They made me purchase another one, and then refunded that back quite a few days later.Six Flags, you need to pick your game up with selling offers which expire, and then you're staff having a standard line of 'We don't do refunds.'.",Nick M

10,Worst theme park ever.,"This park is poorly run and managed. Only HALF the rides are even working today yet we still had to pay full price. Then only good thing about today was the fact there were maybe a thousand people in the whole park so wait times were minimal. But the fact they weren't doing a common sense approach to running one roller coaster train while the other one was loading and unloading, the wait times were double what they should have been. You are required to pay money to use their locker for X2 if you can't store your things in your pocket so my husband and I rode separately to avoid the charge. The park is old, dirty, and not only do I not mind paying 4 times more money to go to Disney, I doubt you could pay me to come back here. So disappointed. Truly the worst park I've ever been to.",Ashley F
50,Terrifying experience but great over all,"So to start with the new roller coaster X2 is very fun... but also very terrifying. I think that kids under 9 should go because what I experienced was scary as heck. It was the first time I got on that ride and it was 2020 Jan 2, and when the ride was going up as always the ride suddenly stop at the highest point of the ride and was kinda broken down. And all u could see was ur feet on the edge and the whole park. The employees had to come up and press some buttons and hope it worked, it did but the rest of the ride was also terrifying because it swings u like a swing u are looking down and up, sideways and upside down. And to add on the fire department works came at the bottom of the coster. The fear of the ride getting stuck there was horrible and after the ride I was telling them how terrifying it was to get stuck at the highest point. But the rest of the parks roller coasters were very safe. Plus the twisted colossus was great and so is the viper, and Goliath. The people did a great job of the park. I would give it a 5 star review!",Enna
30,Ride based park that requires A LOT of attention!,"In summary, I'll list as follows:THE GOOD:*High energy exhilarating rides*Good season pass pricing whether as a membership or single payment*Great variety of roller coaster*Open all year which is terrific because the summer lines are unreal.THE NEEDS ATTENTION:*The lines are unacceptable - way too long and often in very hot conditions. People can wait 90+ minutes on average for most rides.*Their fast pass options are over priced and therefore underused which causes even longer lines.*They must go through so much cooking oil as most foods they serve are fried. No thanks.*No Starbucks or coffee presence - and trust me you need something like that at this location.*The employees are really young and not very invested in their p/t jobs. The issue is that they're operating some pretty intense rides so it makes me wonder.*The upkeep of the park is one of the worst - its dirty and in desperate need of maintenance checks. I was just on the Viper (from 1990) and the car in front kept making a scary clicking noise on the ascent and I looked over and a major section of the fiberglass was broken off with something metal dragging. Umm thats a bit scary. Nobody seems to care about the equipment or how things rung. SO SCARY!*The parking lot is a joke. They make you park far away and have unsuitable access to the park (ie one really old and slow coach bus that connects some parking spots) or walk the distance to the entrance.OVERALL SUMMARY:Not sure who currently owns the park however they really need to invest in it - and not just buy purchasing new off the shelf rides - they need to train staff properly, pay a decent wage so engaged people are interested in working there and invest in the infrastructure (ie upgrade bathrooms, dining options, park cleanliness). Disneyland should be their goal with just a different selection of rides obviously, They can do it - if they want because god knows they're making bank every day and if they aren't, they need a new chairman who can easily figure this all out.",MooshLA
10,Do not go . The worst park I ever been,We visit the park today.we came on 10:30 and left at the end at 20:00. 4 trains do not work at all. Those that work keep been on constraction so you need to wait in line for hours... and that is the reason you are not able to succeed to do more than 5 trains all day. The lines are extremely long.in additional You are not allowed to bring food or drink and ghe drink and food are very expensive. For example drink cost you 8 dolar a can . The minimum and the smallest hamburger cost 22 dolar. In conclusion do not worth the monney. Do not go !!,Shirly D
10,Worst theme park experience ever,"I’d been waiting 20 years to come to this park... And compared to all the parks I’ve visited in North America, Asia and Europe, this is one is a scam. A BIG disappointment.There’s only one car running on most of the roller coasters when there could be three. Their goal is to slow the ride down to a minimum with long wait times to make people buy a fastpass.The wait lines for most rides are usually 90+ minutes, When the rides are functioning! At some point, 5 rides were closed (see the screenshot).customer service expressly stated they won’t compensate for these issues. (of course). If you’re waiting 1:30hr for a ride and it breaks down, they won’t give you a fast pass for later.Also, the place is run down. It looks miserable : decors are inexistant or falling apart, colors are faded and there’s cracks or missing pieces everywhere.During Christmas break, I expected a “magical” experience. After 8h in the park, we managed to ride only 4 roller coasters.",Math
40,Non stop thrills!,"Thrill seekers this is the theme park in LA for you! While it doesn't have the charm of Disney or the incredile 3D effects of Universal, it does have A LOT of intense roller coasters. Unfortunately there were quite a few that were closed during our visit - understandable though because crowds were so minimal we practically walked on to every ride. There also didn't appear to be many food outlets or shops open - again this was likely due to the lack of visitors - I think we were the only people seated and having lunch at about 11:45am on the day of our visit. We took an Uber from our Hollywood Hotel which was about $35 each way, public transport from LA looked too complicated for us. I probably wouldn't recommend this park to families with children. There really is only one all ages ride and perhaps the childrens ride area which just had a few basic fun park rides that they might want to go on",Kelly J
10,"Horrible staff, understaffed , terrible customer service!!!","Got there at 11am nothing was open food wise , they work on their own schedule I guess??? Then we went to go on the rides and it was good the first 30 min then it was a 2 hr wait, so we went and got the fast pass for 90.00 each so we wouldn’t have to wait 2 hrs per ride , by the time we walked back to get the fast pass they raised the price to 120.00 per person when they saw it was getting busy. Spent 500.00 for 2 people to ride 9 rides. Food for 2 people was a easy 100.00 and the wait for food was like a ride🙄and the food was like what u would get in a after hrs McDonald’s leftovers!! But the pizza was great!!! I guess we’re not used to California’s way of customer service (Rude,don’t give a s***attitude) No wonder everyone from California moves to Idaho! 😁",Brigette B
50,Fantastic Amusement Park,My whole family came to this park after a rough recovery from a surgery I had to undergo. The price was quite a bit cheaper than Disneyland and we personally enjoyed it better than Disney as well. I wasn't able to enjoy all of the roller coasters due to recovery from my surgery but I did ride the Goliath and Batman and we are going to have to come back and spend a couple of days because of the sheer number of rides that are available! I highly encourage going to this park!,BpARJ

40,Awesome,"Rides - simply brilliant. All of them. Worth going on as many as you can!jQueues / lines - we went mid / late August in mid week and had more or less zero queues; only one ride (Tatsu) had a queue and it was advertised as 40mins but was an hour.Go midweek after 20th of August for zero queues.Food / drink - ok, but the staff were painfully slow. Really slow. Awful. Especially the kiosk near Tatsu; staff were slow and lazy, and made absolutely no effort, they just didn't work very hard.We had a great day, the rides were brilliant and I strongly recommend coming. This is a 5+ star set of rides with a low star set of food staff.",RichardN28

If you love rollercoasters you must go.Don´t really recommend it for chilidren, unless they like the thrill of this rides, it has a couple of rides for kids, but only a couple.",Vicente A
30,Amazing Rides - Limited and bad food options,"We had a fun day at six flags, the number of great coasters here is amazing.We enjoyed all of them !!The only downside visiting on a quiet Sunday was the simple lack of food options that were actually open.And when we did fine one open we had to stand in line for over 30 minutes to get a lacklustre cold burger and fries.It really took the shine of a great day !The park itself was ok certainly the restrooms could use updating as they are old cold and very tired.So come for the coasters and ignore the rest !!",Michael G

There were so many roller coaster rides, so u have to pick the ones you want to go on and target them first :) We downloaded the six flags app which was really helpful as it gives you directions to the next ride you want to go to and it also gives you the waiting time for the rides.The staff were very friendly and helpful.

20,Great rides but that’s it,"This park has an amazing selection of coasters, however they are just after the titles. Many of the rides are too intense or not looked after.

10,UNRIDING BELIEVABLE,I took my family to magic mountain six flags Saturday for freight nights & to ride the rides. It was extremely packed we waited to get on the X2 for almost 2 hours when the ride shut down and we were told to try again later. We then went to the Full throttle & waited inline only for it to be shut down followed by the Tatsu. We then had to purchase a fast past so we could even ride any of the rides which for the cheap one for a family of 4 is $220 on top of the tickets we already purchased what a rip-off I would not recommend this theme park to anyone. What a waste of time & money not to mention disappointed kids.,714warrenb
50,Best day ever!! At least for me. Here is some must see info before you go 🛑,"So we stayed at the Hilton Embassy Sweets for a hotel. Magic Mountain doesn’t have an official hotel but this hotel comes with a shuttle bus to Magic Mountain so I recommend it. (Also a theme park view)The The theme park is AMAZING if you love thrill rides but if you don’t, you are gonna be riding the merry-go-round again and again. Magic Mountain holds the record for the most roller coasters in the world with 19! And plenty of other thrill rides. (They have the 3rd tallest roller coaster ever). They are also home to an awesome, insane, unique coaster called X2. Be sure to check it out.It is not the most themed Six Flags out there but it still has its hits. (If you like theming you should try justice league)This theme park can be crowded at some times but not at some too. In Summer vacation some of the more popular rides can get a 70min + wait but most rides will stay under 35. There is a fast pass (flash pass) system but it is very expensive. If you are getting flash pass I definitely recommend premium!!! (The rest of the choices are crap) PREMIUM IS VERY HELPFUL. When I first decided to try it I was a bit nervous it wasn’t gonna work but it shortens a 80 min wait to literally zero. It can be a bit confusing on where the flash pass entrance is though, but Just look for the exit of the ride.They have an excellent sushi and Chinese place to eat too.I overall love the theme park and definitely plan on coming back! The best theme park in California 💯%",Tornado Man
50,Fall is a great time to go.,"We went on a Monday. The fall weather in those hills was perfect. Warm enough to make a drenching on our favorite water ride enjoyable and cool enough to climb the hills repeatedly revisiting favorite rides. For anyone preferring smaller crowds, very short lines and less noise the new weekday hours are fabulous. The parking was great also. The age range for our group of 5 was 13- 58. We all had a great time and enjoyed the visit to the park. If you want more entertainment go on a weekend or check the schedule. We were very happy with our choice of day.",B T
40,Half a day was plenty,"Arrived about 1 PM and stayed till closing time at 6 PM. Although too many of the rides and concessions were closed probably because it was midweek and off-season, the kids had a good time with what was left. However, when I felt like having a cuppa I had to walk almost all the way back to the entrance to find a place that served really bad coffee for lots of money. It would have been very poor java even for free.Also irritating was the long hike into and out of the park from the parking lot. No shuttle bus was running today.Two particularly good things about this visit:1. We went today because it was a bring-a-friend-free day. That saved a lot of mullah for two of us in our party who were joining a family with an annual pass;2. At the end of the day on our way out of the park we bought simple, classic milk shakes for each of the kids. They were all very happy with these rich ice cream and milk based shakes. The price was of course outrageous albeit worth paying for such a great shake.",bfindysz
10,3rd world approach,We bought a ticket in the park and not online because they didn’t have the option to buy ticket online. Once you buy the tickets they force you to go online and enter your zip code. Long and complex process. We are not a us citizen so we don’t have a zip code. No option to buy regular ticket awful service. Unbelievable. All other options are much better.,Omer T
40,Fun day,"Our family of teens and younger adults really enjoyed this park and the more thrilling and sometimes extreme rides. Ride lines were short. Food lines were really long and slow but it was the rides we were there for.

10,Staff are thieves (and stupid ones at that)!,"Visited Oct 2019 and my phone fell from my pocket whilst on a ride (which had cash, debit card, and ID inside the case), they advised it can only be retrieved at midnight when the rides shut and that we MUST give them the pin code to unlock the phone (which we refused as you dont need my pin to pick the thing up). So we waited till they did and went back. The lady on the desk tried to tell us they didn't find the phone however when i showed them that the current location (thank you find my phone) showed it had moved from the roller coaster to the office we stood in they said we were mistaken. So we then rang the phone and it starts to ring behind the lady - at which point she says thats not your phone - only the picture of the caller was that of my boyfriend actually ringing the phone and stood in front of her. They gave us the phone - less its case, the money, and the debit card, but it did have my drivers license with it. Amazing how the case fell off and everything else disappeared.Ty for retrieving my phone but you blatantly stole everything else and would have taken the phone also if it were not pin locked / still had battery.",Chloe T
10,Terrible company with terrible policies,"My husband and I bought tickets for the 11th of October, on the last day of our vacation. The park was closed the entire day due to a nearby fire. Now the company is refusing to refund our money - they say we can use the tickets through December, but that would mean planning and paying for an entirely new vacation, which is absurd. Scummy behavior.",Kaylan M
50,"Second visit, love it","I love roller coasters - my 17 year old sister. After visiting six flags she realised the roller coasters she was picturing had nothing on these. The thrill coasters here are out of this world, she was terrified but I loved it! I always do go for fast passes so get the flash pass but it’s no where near as busy as your Disney’s and universals if you go through the week. We did all the rides in one day, a long day, getting there at open but still one day. I would go there again it’s a great thrill. I can’t comment on what younger children would think because we only did the more thrill rides but six flags do cater to all ages. Easy drive from Hollywood, plenty of parking. Pre book parking and tickets online, no reason other than convenience. Highlights would have to be the white one which has the longest loop free fall but the name escapes me, X2 and twisted colossal. first time I went I did Tatsu, can’t do it again- that’s where I draw the line.",mo71ey
50,ROLLERCOASTER World at it's FINEST !!!,"THRILLS GALORE!! Sick of all the other parks that offer baby rollercoasters, small rides, little amusement and HIGH Prices. THEN head over to Six Flags Magic Mountain. Unbelievable prices vs the Others out there. This is thrill world for the whole family and it's now open all year round. I'm over 65 and still love the thrills and spills of all the coasters at 6 Flags. New rides added all the time. JR in Rancho",Jr R
50,Get a Flash Pass,"Enjoyed a great day at the park. Purchased a Flash Pass which enabled us to ride all the major coasters at least once with no wait time when the park was reasonably busy. All the staff we encountered were friendly, food was ok but a bit overpriced and queue time for food was longer than for the rides. Lots of fun though!",MeganJetgirl
40,Day out with the grands,"We went here during the day on a Saturday then stayed for fright fest. Great time and rides for the teen and preteen crowd. Though we went on a Saturday the lines were moving. Longest wait was on the twisted roller coaster. We can't say anything about the food since we didn't eat any in the park. Some of the cons: They charge $5.50 for bottled water, they need to up grade some of the restrooms since. Not many stalls in the women's restroom.",nanaof1boy3girls
50,Freight fest,Great fun for teens- scares them enough and they get exercise walking!! Yeah they are still on their phones but they are walking!! Lol,Vivian L
50,Midweek in mid-Sept - perfect,"2 rollercoasters were closed most of the day, but that was fine, as there are so many others - the park was empty. Couldn't believe they were open. Can't speak to the food; we lunched in the parking lot picnic area. Drinks were like $6 each. Rides are great except for Riddler's Revenge, which will give you a concussion if you are not careful. I think they have beer somewhere near the back of the park, but we didn't realize that until after we'd left and were talking to others.",Paul T
30,It was better on the Weekend,"My mom got us highly discounted season passes, so we made a trip out to CA to visit Magic Mountain. We went on a Friday hoping to skip the crowds. However, all of the main attractions were down for over half the day. We were at the park for 8 hours and went on 3 rides. Two broke down while we were in line. We went the next day hoping to get more out of it, and we did. We stayed for four hours on Saturday and got on 6 rides and managed to see a show. They only keep their rides running on their busy day, so don't bother to go on off days. We're going again for Fright Fest, and we are specifically going on Saturday since we know Fridays are not even worth it.",Raven G
10,Lost and Found is a Joke and does not work at all.,"So a month ago we visited this park and while going to one of the rides i accidentally dropped my prescription glasses ($300) into the net under the ride.I was able to see my glasses and i could even take them if i would have a trash picker. I told the guys who work on the ride, they told me to wait until park closes - we waited and park closed. Filed the report online. Went to customer service. Noone was interested in helping us. I even took a picture of where my glasses are. Glasses have my name engraved on them.It's been a month already and they still did not found my glasses.This park is a joke. Worst customer service ever. I am never going to Six Flags again.",Antonas Kozlovskis
40,Opening night of freight fest 2019,Had a blast walking the park while the sunset waiting for freight fest to kick in! Love some of the new decorations and monsters walking around scaring us!,Carolyn A McC
10,Total S@#t,"If you like queuing this is the place for you. We visited when it was hot no water stations, queuing on the tarmac for the shuttle with no shade. Queuing for everything.Waste of time and money, don’t bother. If I could of given it a zero I would have...........",stevemax147
30,Good fun and food,"We just got the season pass for 4 (2 adults, 7 year and 5 year old) - it is pricey but worth it if you plan to come more often. First time at the park, the lines for entering move pretty quick (but I imagine the busiest time of the year has gone by now).We spent our time in the little kids area - looney toons park. They have some good rides, even the road runner roller coaster has some speed and excitement to it. There is a good mix of rides for different thrill levels.The food is good. We tried the burger, chicken tenders, and wings. The tenders and wings are really tasty. Food is pricey also, so getting the meal plan is worth it.Staff at the entrance, rides, and restaurants are all friendly. Bathrooms could be up kept better.",dinfamily2009
50,Must visit!,"If you are a rollercoaster enthusiast like me, this park (along with Cedar Point in Ohio) is an absolute “must visit”. Highly recommend taking advantage of them now being open 365 days per year. I went in mid-May and late September and literally did not wait in ANY lines. I thought some coasters were closed because I didn’t see them running then realized they weren’t running because THERE WAS NO ONE THERE TO RIDE THEM and I could literally walk on and some times had the ride to myself. This is completely un-heard of at a park like this. Tatsu is for sure the 2nd best coaster on the entire planet. (#1-Cedar Point’s Top Thrill Dragster).",Russ
50,Super fun and not crowded,Awesome rides and super nice staff. No crowds this time of year. Pace yourself when the rides are easy to get on. I am a veteran rider and became moderately ill by the end of the day by being able to ride too often. 5 minute ride times all over the park!,lifeafterdies
30,Park was fun but.....,"We visited Six Flags on a weekday, as others have said on recent reviews it was very quiet with little to no wait time on rides.Our main problem was that customer service was basically non existent.As first time overseas visitors we found it is not the easiest place to get around, there are different levels due to being on a mountain side and it can be hard to find the entrance to rides. On the far side of the park from the entrance we did not see a staff member anywhere for a good 90 minutes at least (apart from loading/unloading rides). Virtually all of the stores and pop up stalls were closed so it wasn’t like you could even ask anyone there. Most of the food options were closed and the one that we did find open was abysmally slow and the food was cold. Even after we asked for a replacement it was only marginally better and the staff member didn’t much care.We also waited with others at a blocked entrance to the superman ride for a good 10 -15 minutes with nobody in sight and no notification or signage of what was going on (ride closed?)If the park doesn’t want to pay staff then they certainly need to improve their signage and perhaps invest in some electronic signage to advise what rides, stores etc are open in real time. Apart from 1 sign at the front gate (in hindsight should have taken a pic) there was no notification anywhere on which rides were closed. We also couldn’t find it in app.The service at the shop near the DC ride was very average, the staff were more interested in unpacking boxes and taking phone calls than a real life customer. And basically nothing was priced so I had to ask for help which was a clear inconvenience to the staff.There should also be notification on their website about about what will be open/closed on the day you visit, it really was like a ghost town and we were disappointed with the food/drink and shops available.A final word of advice- whatever you do don’t waste your money like we did on a fast pass if you are going in quiet times. Rookie/tourist error. They really shouldn’t even be selling it to be honest.We went to Universal and Disneyland in the same week and both were busy and the fast pass worth every cent. Do not waste your money here in low season it is not worth it.",mdjtravel
50,Rollercoasters,"Great line up of rollercoasters, from the tame to the thrilling - Twisted Colossus is great and long.Went just after Labour Day weekend and there was not many people.",Matt Welsh
40,Great place for thrill seekers,"We came here with kids since they are on fall break and wanted to spend some family time together. We had a great time and the place was dead. We were able to get on anytime in less than five minutes. I was a little disappointed as some rides were closed and not advertised however considering we didn’t have to wait then we were ok. We all had a great time but be prepared there were hardly any water fountains so be prepared to dish out some money for water. Unless they give you a water cup. Other than that, the visit was nice.",katillac74
50,3rd visit and it never gets boring!,"Went here last Thursday and the place was dead! We were going to get fast passes but didn't need them. We literally walked on to everything!At one point, my wife and I were the only ones on Superman!!!We love it here. It is a little terrifying but if you love coasters, you will adore it here.",ChrisGower1975
50,Wow!,"I have been dreaming of coming to this park since I was young, playing it on RollerCoaster Tycoon.It exceeded my expectations 10 fold. To me it is the king of theme parks here in California. These RollerCoasters are world class.Going on a Monday during school time, we did not have to wait for any ride. Which for the park is bad but for me travelling this area for the first time good!Thanks to the amazing staff for letting us ride the rides multiple times and helping us when we couldn't find where X2 was (not for the faint hearted).Best RollerCoaster and a 'Must Ride' for me is Twisted Colossus.Ride it as many times as you can. It is the best coaster I have ever ridden alongside the Viper!Thanks Guys!",Mr_FennecFox
40,The most rollercoasters in the World,"Yes, Six Flags Magic Mountain has the most of them in the World. There are over 20 rollercoasters within the park and through different reasons it's nearly impossible to ride them all in 1 day. A lot of the rollercoasters are absolutely spectacular and some of them even unique. The best chance to ride most of them is to be there just before the park opens during low season (for example on a weekday in September).Magic Mountain is build on and around a hill so there are huge differences on the height of the pathways throughout the park. You don't have to walk up and down the hill all day since there is a helpful elevator ride near the carrousel. Keep in mind that it can get very hot in the park even in low season but there are some fun water rides to cool down. You will get soaked on the water rides. Don't skip: 'Battle for Metropolis' a great indoor laser shooting ride featuring the DC characters.Six Flags Magic Mountain is a really nice park and an absolute must if you're a rollercoaster fanatic. The only reason I don't rate the park 5 stars is because of the slow operations. I will definitely come back to Magic Mountain for new rides!",Raoul Vincent
50,Drop of Doom experience,"If you go there, you should absolutely try drop of doom. Goliath and tatsu are very extreme rides and we liked these 3 rides so much. If you have stressful life, you need to come here...",Stratosphere
50,Thrill Seekers Paradise,This is a place fro true thrill seekers. There are great roller coasters and lots of them. Its hot and there's not much shade and very steep hills to climb. There are also many rides for younger kids. There is something for everyone here!,sasasas
50,Amazing,What an amazing place if you’re a rollercoaster fan. Some of the best rollercoasters in the world all in one place. My friend and I went just after Labor Day and the park was so quiet with the longest wait being just 20 minutes long!!Loved it!!,Dibbledoyle
40,Best rides on the west coast. Worst customer service,"This park has truly awesome rides. So many of them that i would advise id you are only going once get some form of express pass they have 3 options.I dont know which ride is my favourite as so many of them aee so good. Do take sun screen and a hat, very little shade and no outlets have air con.The one thing that lets this place down is tge truly awful customer service. We were in a line for an hour to exchange our passes for tickets. Service at many of the food outlets is dreadfully slow, several of the managers should see how it can be done at knotts.",joep735
50,Awesome Rides,"Went to Six Flags with our 11 year old daughter, the rides were fantastic and well set out in the park. When they call it Magic Mountain they are not kidding, it’s very steep and lots of hills and stairs but the cable car can take you up and down so of you plan well you can walk downhill mostly. Ride lines late August were short and food and drink choices were good and not too expensive.",Paul F
50,Thrills to the max!,"This park doesn’t play around. We are thrill enthusiasts and I definitely got my fix here. We went on about 13 roller coasters here. Most of them were incredible. Twisted Colossus is one of my new all time favorite rides. I have never experienced anything like that before.The experience was fantastic. I have to admit being from south Florida, walking up and down hills was getting me. This park is in the mountains so I found that part challenging. It was an incredible experience though, we did two days at this park.I know they have family friendly rides as well. We skipped over those but we definitely saw them. We did ride The Justice League which was not a coaster. It’s a really fun interactive dark ride.If you are doing more than one day here check out the memberships. We bought a gold one because it was cheaper than purchasing two day tickets per person. The good news is the memberships work at all their parks. This gives us an excuse to travel to another state within the year!",melodym1976
50,Great Place. Great Rides,"Rides are awesome. Love Six Flags. Food is expensive, however, it is no different than from any other amusement park. Food is always expensive at places like this.",Earle G
50,Always a great time!,I’ve been coming to Magic Mountain since it opened! Great rides and attractions. A CALI institution!,Christopher H
40,Great fun but it's not Disney,"They have great rollarcoasters, BUT they don't test them before they open the park because they don't want to spend the money to have employees come early to do so. That means you race to the coasters only to find half were not running or having issues. Very uncool. Eventually some opened, but then you had to contend with long lines as now the park was more full. So while this has the potential to be a great park the lack of efficiency and organization makes it a frustrating experience for guests. Overall though my family did have an enjoyable day by the end despite the disappointment of not being to do all the rides they had expected.",MtngirlKim
50,Sister and Me😁,"It was a Great Day! Celebrating Labir Day at the parks. Sister and Me had an AWESOME experience from the parking lot to enjoying the parks!Everyone was accommodating, from our the easy access to purchasing our membership seasonal passes online, to parking our car, catching the parking lot bus, to activation of our online pass purchases at member services to easy access into the parks.We were met with an employee offering to rake our picture to capture our time together in the parks!😁 to thr friendly experience at the membership stand were we received our free lanyard to hold our ""Platinum Membership"" cards, our free bottle for free refills of fruit punch, tea or soda drinksthroughout our stay and future visits at all Six Flags parks across the country!As we walked the parks we enjoyed the variety of food offered for sell, the diversity of rides and many vendors fir shopping!🎁🎈🎊🎉We enjoyed our flash passes to skio the long ride lines and go straight to the front of the lines!But besr of all was the wonderful layouts of the parks, cleanliness and fun times laughing together, taking pictures together, eating the food and spending time together in a friendly abd safe environment!The one downfall was all the ""Bees"" swarming around the nany trash cans😳😒",KRinggold
40,Lots of Family Fun,"We went to Magic Mountain with 3 kids and 5 adults. We were able to get discount admission because 3 people had annual passes. The funnel cake is a must try. If yo wait until you leave, you’ll have to wait in a long line. Most of the rides I grew up riding are still there. They are updating their whole western section (which was my favorite) so I was bummed I didn’t get to do that. The lines weren’t too long and they still serve the best frozen lemonade from Freshers. It is a must try! I also missed the log ride which they took out.",anna_b_nanas
40,"Good park, good experience, average compared to other amusement parks.","We went to this location because we were visiting the area. Purchased the tickets and parking online prior to arrival. We visited on a Monday and it was very very quiet which was excellent. However, it was super hot. Very little shade around this park. Be prepared. In terms of coasters there is a good variety. Many options for one park. Being able to use the prebooking option with the fast pass was a good choice. Even with the park not being that busy, it saved us time not having to wait in any line, and therefore ensured we got on every ride. All the staff we encountered has smiles on their faces, chatted away and answered any questions.We have been to Cedar Point a number of times and compared to that park I would put them about par, in terms of a fun day out for a family. Food in this Six Flags is ridiculously expensive. I know amusement parks can be pricey, but for a fountain medium size Sprite to be $6.59 USD is absurd. We refused to eat at the park and waited until it closed before heading to a nearby Cheesecake Factory.",RCMommy
50,Fun for all ages,My boyfriend and I went to six flags and had a blast. It was overcast so we only did the theme park and even though there were minimal waits in line we only managed to do 9 or so of the Thrill rides. We were there from open to close and it wasn't as busy as we expected. We debated buying the fast passes but didn't and we didn't need them. The longest line we waited in was 1 hour BUT it was a water rapids ride (that wasn't that great). Everything else either had no line-up or a 15 minute wait. We used the park app as well. Funnel cake was expensive but worth it. Wish we had more time to spend there and we will definitely be back to another six flags!!!,karmst86
10,Horrible Customer Service!,I bought the Diamond membership and wanted to ask a few questions so I started a chat with Agent : Diana T. She gave me really bad customer service. Not trying to solve my problems nor help me find a solution. She was also giving me a lot of false information that made me want to cancel my membership. Once I said that she was like well then pay the cancelltion fee its $141. Instead of trying should be helping me or trying to keep me as a member. I was like wow they must not value customer or even their membership holders. After going around over and over. I asked for the manager 3 times throughout out conversation and she wouldn't transfer me. She told me the Manager will just say the same thing and gave me the customer service number to call. That made me even more upset. She was pretty much saying the management would give me as horrible of a service as her. When she finally did transfer me. The Manager was able to solve my problem explaining to me what my membership entitled. The manager apologize for the other rep. Since the other rep was giving false information. She also told me she will talk to that rep to make she's better for the next person.,Lexynguyen7
50,Rollercoasters rule,"Firstly if you are from the UK this beats Alton towers for coasters. More that you can do in one day. The cheapest way to buy tickets is via the app but they don’t take payment unless you use a US credit card or US PayPal account 🙁. I used google to find a ticket the day before using get your guide app and still saved 20 per person. Don’t pay on the door. Food is fairly standard and expensive. They day we went was hot, 38c, so take plenty of suntan lotion and look for the water fountains as bottled is 8. Best ride was full throttle for us but there is plenty to choose from. We didn’t need fast pass as we went on a Friday and it was quite no queueing more than 10 mins",NogginTN
40,great day,"Attended mainly for the thrill rides with my 16yo daughter. we were not disappointed on the quality of the rides (X2 was awesome) luckily we could afford the flash pass otherwise we would not have had time to go on most of the rides, food quality was ok but as usual for theme parks extremely expensive and couldn't get a table to sit at.",Tony O
50,5 Folks had a Terrific Time,"Best roller coasters anywhere. Had 5 kids in their teens and twenties with me in my fifties. They were all experienced coaster riders and everyone loved the rides!

20,Rip off & X2 unsafe!,We were there 22 August. Multiple thrill rides & food/beverage stands were closed. No prior info that rides were closed and still had to pay full price. A TOTAL RIPOFF! F&B prices are beyond ridiculously expensive and food quality is the pits. $12 for a microwaved cheese burger with limp lettuce & cold cheese! $6 for a pepsi. Most staff couldn’t give a damn. X2 is a dangerous ride with insufficient head padding when you get knocked around. First & last time at 6 Flags Magic Mountain!,Steve
30,The potential is there but a sense of greed thickens it,"I love roller coasters, it's my hobby and I travel the world for that. This park is probably one of the highlights of my visit - there are crazy roller coasters here!But when I went to buy a drink and had to pay $ 6 a bottle of Pepsi (!) I felt they were overstating. Beyond the costly price tag trying to get me there more and more about everything, there is a limit to closed places too, whose audience is a ""captive audience"" even at Disney take far less.Too bad - these are my places. You will be less greedy and you will earn much more - not just money.",parkman
50,Six Flags,"Great day out for me and my two teenage children all the rides were excellent, not suitable for younger children as all the rides are adrenaline fuelled, only drawback is the exorbitant price of food and drink and you cant bring your own",Tom O Rourke
50,Drive by sighting,"I just have to do a review on Six Flags Magic Mountain because as we came up that valley and to look to our right side and see roller coaster city it was truly an impressive site. We did not go in Six Flags this day because we were driving through but being someone from out of state I have always heard about Six Flags but never knew where it was. It just looks like it’s solid roller coasters. I most likely would puke my guts out if I went on all of those Because I am old, but that looks like such a fun place that I could bring my grandkids to and spend a wonderful day watching them having the thrills of their life. Six Flags, we will be back.",Wesley G
30,MANY MANY of the Rides were down - NO REFUND,"I understand a ride or 2 having maintanxe. But thsi day the majority of the rides were either closed or only had 1 car working, which tripled the wait time. It didn't matter what ride, Colossus was down. Reveloution was down. Batman was down. Viper was open and close through out the day. Even Hot Rod racers were down. Do we geta refund? NO! Do we still ay full price? Yes!",P601AHdavidb
30,Rides are good but OMG the customer service is AWFUL,I don't know whether it was because its the end of the summer so the staff is sub-par or they don't care but the customer service is truly awful at this park. It took 10 mins more than it should have EVERY SINGLE TIME we tried to eat. It was laughable how slow the staff could be. At one stage there were 5 people behind the counter but only one serving customers. The flashpass was a waste of money for this time of year as the lines for the rides were mostly only 5 minutes long. That was my bad. The flashpass 'wristwatch' is a ridiculous device created by someone who has no idea how to make electronic interfaces. There was at least 5 swipes in one direction or another to get to reserving a ride. It is super hot but they do have a lot of shade and we also went into the Hurricane Harbor water park which helped ease the heat. All in all its a 'one and done' experience for our family.,PMSan Diego
10,Worse customer service and experience,"I am here at the six flags magic mountain in Valencia I came with my husband and 5 children. We just received the most terrible customer service and not only is one my kids in extreme medical pain from his neck riding our first ride but one of my daughters friend fainted as well. Wow RILEY not only had the worst customer service but the most ruthless human being I have ever encountered. To have 2 parents who are concerned about our son who was in a lot of pain be treated that way is un except able. She is a manager? Wow. She didn’t give us anything, she didn’t give any solution at all and didn’t provide us with anything. So we left empty handed, one kid light headed,one with a disabled neck, wasted gas, only road on one ride, disappointed children, and upset parents. We officially have had the worst experience in all theme park experiences, and RILEY made it worse. Our kids are crying and upset. I asked for service and she told me that I could go to the food court and talk to their manager. We drove far to get injured and disrespected.",nicole m
50,🎢,"If you're looking for thrills this is the place to go!! The rollercoasters are top notch,the lastest in technology and are scary but that's what we go there for,especially adults! This is not a park for small and young children.lol. we got the Fast Pass after hesitating, the $80 more(if you can) were well worth it. The lines are soooo long and the wait horrible,which allowed us to do 10 rides during the day instead of 4 or 5 without the pass,and this taking our 1st ride at 2 p.m.! If you don't hava a fast pass get there at the opening which will allow you to do more rides with less people. It is noteworthy that the park closes at 8p.m.but you can still get on rides up until 9(which we did)!!",happyinparistimestwo
40,Crazy rides,"Visited today (13th august), on a very hot day, and were really really surprised that the park was not super busy. No wait on loads of them. My favourites were full throttle and Batman, one reason being they were smooth rides....Ninja was so rattly , it gave me a headache (maybe I'm just getting old), just my experience. Bottled some rides.....eg Goliath, X2, and tatsu. Loved the water rides and got very wet 🙂🙂 it was a super fun day. I last visited in 1981 (!!! I was a child!!) & remembered Revolution.Clean everywhere and seemed well organised.My two gripes:- Some water fountains didn't work- not enough coffee round the park!!!",runninggirlEssex
10,ATTENTION FOLKS! Don't be FOOLED !!!,"We were Very disappointed on 08/12/2019 and here's the story: by the end of 2018,we received from you your email highlighting different options to renew the season pass and we choose the Gold pass.it cleary says that you can bring a friend any day any time during 2019. My sister was planning to visit us here all the way from France and my husband and i thought it would be nice to offer her 2 visits to the park during her holidays. Yaay how exciting! Today at the entrance to the water park we were told that this offer only works with six flags and not the water park!!!!!! How come? Now you are saying that you are 2 different parks !!!!! How come you are 2 different parks if access to the 2 is ok with the same card!!!! Plus the gold pass clearly mentions bring your friend any day any time for free. How are we supposed to know that this is only ok for sixflags and not for the water park especially that access to both parks is made with the same card... you are simply trying to fool people. We really regret being members for 3 years in a row . This is such a shame . Thank you for ruining a day i was waiting for months 😑😑😑😑",Maroua
10,Good rides,"Great rides, full on adrenaline rush! Kids age 9 and 12 loved it. Public areas are a bit grubby and the food and drink is EXTORTIONATE but that’s pretty standard for most theme parks. We used an access pass as youngest is unable to queue for long periods, unfortunately we could only use the pass once every hour so it was a bit pointless but on a quieter day the pass can be used every 15 minutes. The pass is available from the kiosk that loans out the wheelchairs and strollers, we only found this out after queuing for nearly an hour at guest services where the website tells you to go to collect the pass. They could do with correcting that information. Big walk from car park to the entrance but there is a shuttle bus, very slow though. Also you have to pay another $25 to park.",Ruth J
50,Perfect for family with teenagers!!,"This is a mad day out and the rides are HUGE! The park itself is enormous and the map is invaluable (would have been useful to have stands with more maps available within the park as the one we’d been given on entering fell apart after a couple of hours!) Couldn’t fault the rides. All slickly run and small queues (Monday early July). We did have a flash pass (after reading the on-line reviews) which meant we could just walk on to every ride.In our experience, the park was spotless and toilets very clean (those critics in some of the previous reviews need to experience a UK theme park.......!)There seemed to be adequate food options but, as you’d expect, all fast food and all horrendously overpriced. Free iced tap water is available at every food outlet.Our day here made lots of memories and we had lots of fun!",369Hilaryx
40,Great rides,"We were lucky to go on a week day, it was not super busy, although you need to wait 30-45 minutes for some rides. Water ride kept me completely wet, it took a long time to dry out. I enjoyed most of the rides. Cons: it is difficult to navigate inside the park, there were no exit signs, except on the exit itself. The park is very big. Please, post some arrows to follow to the exit.",Alice W
40,A lot of fun!,We decided to visit this park and after purchasing tickets felt nervous because of the reviews. They were wrong. We had fun and though it is not as well kept as Disneyland it was clean enough for an amusement park. We enjoyed all the coasters we went on. The flash pass was worth it and helped with wait times. We stayed only one day and did all we wanted. We did not go to the water park. I would Okan a separate day for that.,Fluffyunicorn
40,Great place for older kids,Magic Mountain has a lot of great large roller coasters that are perfect when your kids have outgrown parks like Disneyland,time4miller
40,We wore ‘em out!,"Had a great time with the teenage granddaughters, great roller coasters!We went on the Tatsu first... sure wasn’t expecting the zero g rolls! I may have let out an expletive or two...oops...My only criticism was that everything looked so run down since my last visit years ago. Paint was faded and chipped, and it made me wonder if the rides were as poorly cared for...Food... super pricey and not that great but we were there for the roller coasters and they did not disappoint.",SinginSuzi
50,They say Magic Mountain has some of the best roller coasters in the world,"They say Magic Mountain has some of the best roller coasters in the world. It did not disappoint. We got there late and only did a few rides. Full Throttle has a giant upside down loop. I loved the old wooden Colossus but the new Twisted Colossus was even better. Crazanity, Lex Luther and the Battle for Metropolis ride were all new for us and so much fun. I wasn't happy with how long it takes to unload on Tatsu, it's a little uncomfortable hanging on that for a while.",HappyJana
40,Good value if you buy the pass and can come more than once,"Six Flags is a rollercoaster lover's dream--I assume. I'm not a rollercoaster lover, so.... I have the pass. Odd, right? I love the park. I love to walk around and just enjoy the atmosphere. Sometimes, I don't enjoy certain areas because of the volume; but that's a small annoyance. This park is great if you have a pass and can come more than once. Otherwise, I wouldn't come here. Well, I would come on a not-so-crowded day if I can help it. However, it isn't even the long lines at the rides that would keep me away. It's the long lines at the food vendors and how long it takes to go through them. I don't know how it is that restaurants outside of the park have figured out how to move their lines along, but Magic Mtn hasn't; and the line doesn't have to be long. I've stood waiting a good 15 minutes with only one person in front of me. How is that?! I have never waited 15 minutes just to order with just one person in front. For some reason, that bothers me more than the long ride lines.",ahryunbunch
50,Mega rides!!!,Wow this place is insane! So many rollercoasters that are all amazing! We absolutely loved it here! We went on a Wednesday and it was fairly quiet. Food expensive but you kind of expect it. The Twisted Colossus was absolutely the best rollercoaster,Duerds5
50,It’s The Original WallyWorld Folks... so Fun,"I’ve visited Magic Mountain many times for the rip roaring speed of the roller coasters, the fun laid back atmosphere, the always open year round vibes, the great food and the beautiful people.This last trip was amazing with a few couples, we had a blast, bought the “front of the line” pass and enjoyed every bit of it. We highly recommend this location when knocking out your Six Flags is experience!",Brandon M
40,"Before booking, look to see or call about what rides are closed","Absolute worth every penny to buy a fast pass, only in line for 4-6minutes. Most was 15 versus an hour; keep from overheating too. Got to ride 12 rides. Though Lex Luther ride and X2 closed. Worth it to buy the refillable. Took two water bottles in prior and they didn't say anything",Teresa L
40,"Great place for coasters, bad for food","I had not visited Magic Mountain since I was a kid. This time I went with my teenage sons. They loved it. We rode roller coasters all day and did not ride the same one twice. Some of the coasters were very unique. I rode standing up, leaning back and leaning forward. I was great fun. The only downside was the food service. The service was very slow and the food mediocre. Food is generally not great at amusement parks, but it should not take 20 minutes to get a slice of pizza. None of the food staff looked like they wanted to be there. Conversely, those that worked the rides appeared to be having fun.",Fishoutofwater66
50,"Six flags magic mountain, california",I've been to alton towers and Thorpe Park in the UK so when I was in America I had to visit one of their six flags. The rides here are amazing I paid $96 for a day pass and visited on a Tuesday in march which was fairly quite so managed to get on the superman ride twice which is a must. I spent about 7hrs here and longest I queued was 30 mins for terminal velocity. I was going to buy the fast pass but it was so quiet decided not to. They also had a barbecue on the go and hotdog stands which for a park were not to expensive. Other rides I would recommend are the riddler/batman and ninja unfortunately the roaring rapids ride wasn't working that day but been told this is also a must.,Terry L
40,Boys Loved It!,"My boys... ages 15, 12, & 10 loved the park! But they’re huge roller coaster fans! And this park has roller coasters! Over 20 if I counted correctly. Two were closed due to the construction of the new ride opening in 2020. It was hot!!! 95 degrees hot! And I wish they had more places to refill the “refillable” soda bottles. My only complaint! I’d definitely get a flash pass if you want to ride all the coasters in a day! And of course like any other “park” food & drink (& parking) is expensive!",SparBoys
10,Security threw us out,"A white security guard approached my (black) nephew because he had a vaping battery in his hand in security; he demanded he leave the park and hand it to me because I’m 21 and he’s 18 (from Arizona where vaping is legal for 18 y/o).They send us back through security line for 30 minutes and then do the SAME THING TO ME AND DEMAND I THROW IT AWAY, I explained to them that they JUST TOLD ME I COULD HAVE IT AND I CAN BECAUSE IM 21.After telling me to throw it away we start walking away and the security guard comes over AGAIN harassing my nephew claiming that my nephew had drugs on him, and that he couldn’t enter the park.AT THIS POINT THEY CALL THE COPS ON US BECAUSE MY 18 Y/O B.L.A.C.K. WAS ACCUSED OF BEING A TROUBLEMAKER BY A WHITE SECURITY GUARD, AND LATER BY WHITE COPS.We had to leave 1 hour after arriving at the park, all of which was spent being sent through security- two separate times- and them lying to us about the rules, and then trying to write us tickets for having having nicotine on their property?????No refund for $100 ticket * 4 people, or $25 parking * 2Six flags magic mountain customer relations who refused to admit my Haitian nephew: KarenWHEN I ASKED THEM HOW TO FILE A COMPLAINT? “GO TO SIX FLAGS DOT COM”",Cameron B
50,Get a flash pass,Since it was summer we had booked flash pass which made it possible to try almost all the rides in one day. If we had not taken the flass pass we would have had spend most of the hot day standing in ques. The rides are amazong and almost all were open and we could try a few of the best ones more than once. The heat does take its toll and food and drinks are not cheap but as an adult I think that it was worth the high cost my kids agree as well.,Resepappa
50,Best six flags park,Magic mountain is six flags best park along with the one in Texas. We are huge coaster people so this place had plenty of awesome ones. We visited on a Wednesday in July and there were not many people. The longest wait was about 30 min. Some of the coasters only had one car running but it told you that at the line entrance. Our favorite was twisted colossus. Food was actually decent compared to other six flags parks. We don’t expect much. It was very clean and Well maintained. All the workers were super friendly and nice. We had a great visit and it’s a definite stop for roller coaster lovers. They are all awesome except for x2 and viper.,br9999
50,The One and Only Six Flags - Great Park,"A big place, with big rollercoaster-type rides, big crowds, and big parking area. Still, a special place and one fo the great parks in America.",Dana Los Angeles
50,Coaster capital of the world!,"We visited six flags on a Sunday near the end of July and we couldn’t have been more pleased with the experience. The rollercoasters are brilliant - personally some of the best in the world. It is great for hardcore theme park lovers but also having a children’s area and carnival games.Despite going on a Sunday, it wasn’t as busy as we expected in comparison to universal studios we had visited the day before. However, we still had premium flash pass which is a very clever system cutting down queuing times up to 90%. I highly recommend using this - it is very much worth its price.Food there was pricey but you can’t expect anything less at theme parks but the service was good.Just for a warning - do not go on the rollercoaster viper... we figured that it is around 29 years old now and it was the ricketiest coaster my family and I has ever been on - I had a headache after. However there are so many other amazing rollercoasters to go on that we couldn’t even go in everything.Overall, we a brilliant time and would certainly go back again.",Martin
40,Great time and amazing adult coasters,"We’d come w 3 small children (7,6,3) and the Toonland was perfect for them. They loved the variety they had to offer in there. The loony toons show was cute and interactive. They all loved the roller coaster inside Toonland for them.Is adults purchased the flash pass for 3 and used that for all our rides and did the children’s in between. Hands down the Twisted Colossus was the top! Second would of been Tatsu but there’s something about that wooden meets steel that’s irreplaceable!The only down about it was with strollers there’s a killer hill going down to jet stream and the rides that way. If I’d come again I’d never go down there w strollers. Getting up the hill after 7 hours previously in the park was a killer and exhausting. We ended leaving right after that because us adults were done.",PlaytimewithMiss_T_e
40,Surreal roller coasters,"This theme park is by far the best I’ve been to. It’s main focus is roller coasters and they had some incredible rides that you wouldn’t be able to find in other theme parks. My personal favourite ride was either superman or Goliath because it gave the adrenaline rush that you go there for. We didn’t have much waiting time as we bought the flash pass which allows you to skip the queues. I personally found it very helpful for some rides however other rides didn’t need it as much although I would definitely recommend it if you’re up to pay for it. It allowed you to skip the entire queue and the only waiting you had to do was in the row you wanted to sit in for the ride. However superman doesn’t do flash passes at all, other than that every other ride did (depending on the level you got the pass) There was food places where you could have lunch however the queues for this was very long and I had to wait for 15 minutes to order my food. Overall, it was a great experience but it would be a little better if the food queues weren’t as long.",Siobhain Doyle
20,"Rides are great, food service is a scam.","The rides are great. Outstanding coasters and thrill rides. Go during a week day when it is not as crowded. On a Thursday evening we rode several coasters consecutive times.Use a Flash Pass if you can, but make sure you get a return receipt. Six Flags attempted to charge us for a lost pass which we turned in. The incompetence, rudeness and arrogance of the Flash Pass staff led me to believe it was an intentional scam designed to fleece visitors. The staff would not answer questions, would not contact a supervisor, they were completely incapable and uninterested in any customer service and could only repeatedly ask ""who did you talk too?""Food. Stay away from the food service. The food is terrible, and the service is worse. They take an order, then prepare the order, one order at a time, then give the order to the person at the same window and make everyone wait in line while that goes on. Instead of having order windows, pickup windows, or numbers to call when on ready. The result is waiting for food with short lines can take 45 minutes. Six Flags should contact In-n-Out or any of the fast food corporations on how to do food service. Six Flags is completely clueless about food service.The Gold Cups, refillable drink cups are also close to being a scam. There are only two places we found in the park where found we could fill them. Otherwise you have to stand in a food line for a drink.We bought passes for both the Six Flags and Hurricane Harbor Water Park. But beware the if you buy passes for both parks the Flash Passes are separate in each park. Not something Six Flags makes obvious.The rides are great, but the incompetence of the staff and wretched food service ruined what might have been a great visit.",JCM

10,OK rides. Food service like stepping back 40 years,"It Ian 33 years since I last visited Magic Mountain, it’s still very hot, the roller coasters are great, they even upgraded Colossus. One think that did strike me was the lack of thought, imagination and organisation that has gone into the food service. Sure it’s a ride park and maybe we should expect rubbish food. Having to queue however for 40 or 50 minutes on a relatively quiet day was unreal. Most of the employees seem to be standing around waiting for the queue to move, whilst one person, the punch point of the operation, was worked off their feet. Six Flags obviously don’t invest in half decent operation management. If they did they could probably make much more money, have happy eaters and allow us all to focus on the rides!",Shackera
50,Pure adrenaline,"If you are looking for an upside down stomach go to this park. Amazing, but need for fast track ticket if you want to do it in 1 day.If you are going by taxi remember to use Uber, costs around 60 USD instead of 100 of standard taxi.",Giancarlo M

40,5 star rides,"5 star rides but 4 stars as the overall experience isn’t perfect. The rides are amazing, great for thrill seekers. I particularly loved Tatsu, full throttle and twisted colossus. Should have more single rider options and better loading efficiency. Slow service for food and snacks. Toilets could be cleaner. Also needs better bag/locker control (don’t bother using lockers like they insist-I spent a dollar each time like a good girl only to find on every ride I went on except X2 people just left bags on the side at the loading station). It’s a shame it’s not easier to get to as well-it is possible by public transport from LA but no tours go there.Also beware it’s a lot hotter up there than in LA so be prepared for some extreme heat in the summer.But if you love rollercoasters it’s worth all the effort and minor frustrations!",Sophie S

50,Fast passes are worth the price,"We bought the platinum fast pass as we are from Oregon and wanted to make use of our time at Magic Mountain. Best thing we did. Longest time we waited was 5 mintues. Was able to ride every ride in the park, except the kiddie rides.Food price meals range from 12.49 - 14.99. Drinks average $3-6. Six Flags offers a meal plan deal of $34.99 (or 34.50 don't remember exactly) which includes unlimited drinks in a souvenir cup. If you just wanted the unlimited souvenir cup drink they run $17.99 for one. Plus tax on all.Parking is $25.00 per a day.We planned on several days at the parks so after a lot of research I bought our family the Diamond Membership. It includes many different Six Flags parks including Hurricane Harbor. Sounds crazy, but it was cheaper in the overall scope. We got preferred parking for free. 35% discount on food and merchandise. Free unlimited souvenir drink cups. We got the upgraded platinum fast pass for $80.00 which let us ride every single rollercoaster. For food we paid $16.88 for two meals total.So in the end we saved money by doing the membership.If you ride X2 and have slip on shoes, take them off. Our daughter lost her Vans on the ride. One shoe just flew off. Several other people lost their shoes too.Full Throttle is amazing. As is most of the coasters.Magic Maintain is a great park if you are a rollercoaster lover.Just wanted to state we never had one park employee be rude. Every single one was polite and great to us!",Michelle S
30,Great park - but be aware of online purchases,"The park is the Roller Coaster Capital of the World. It offers the wildest and scariest coasters yoy can imagine. Definitivelty thd place to go if you like wild coasters. I do not recommend buying passes online as we got cheated when we bought a gold pass package including parking. Aparently passes was ti be picked up short time after the purchase, which wasnt clear during the purchasing process. I tried to talk to the staff byt got nothing but arrogante answers from the front line employee to the highest ranking employee at the park. Where i am from, Customers are allways right.

40,West coast capital of roller coasters,"Every year I make my annual pilgrimage to Six Flags Magic mountain. I personally love this place! Its the west coast's thrill capital of theme parks. This park has everything to make your heart skip a beat. But it does have smaller rides for the kids as well. The kids park (Bug Bunny land) has 2 mini coasters, for your little 1's to join the excitement. Til they graduate to the bigger coasters. But there's many other options other then the rollercoasters. But the star of the park are the coasters. The park prides itself on having the largest collection of rollercoasters in 1 park. Its known as the thrill capital of the west. Which I agree, if your an adrenaline junkie this is your place !The park has several coasters to choose from. From the novice to the scariest thing you've ever ridden. The park is built on a hill/mountain side. So there are alot of hills to cover when getting to your ride. The park has the usual carnival games, that give cheesy prizes. And there are several different restaurants spread across the park. Most just serve snack type food. And yes, its a bit expensive like any theme park. But its nice the park offers a all you can drink cup. (1 day pass or a season pass cup) So that really helps quench your thirst on a hot day.The park offers a flash pass, so you can skip the lines. But its a bit pricey & there's different prices for the flash pass. I always purchase 1, because I usually visit during peak periods. But if you want to avoid any lines, visit Monday thru Thursday. The lines are almost non existent on those days.(Because the park is open 365 days a year.)And like most reviews, I would agree the bathrooms need some serious attention. The bathrooms are old & dated looking. The park itself is nice and has plenty of shade, due to the trees around the park. And some of the rides could use a good painting, to freshen up there look. But don't expect the park to be Disneyland, if your use to that kind of park.Overall the Value is good, the rides are excellent, and the place keeps upping there game for more thrills. I will continue to make this place, my number #1 park in America. But if your new to Six flags Magic Mtn. Check the website for specials that the park offers. Some hidden perks are early entry, stay late (after the park closes,) And ticket specials.",Clorissa P

The smallest admission lines typically occur after noon and the smallest ride lines occur in the evenings after families with children depart.",jackmgibbons

50,"Great trip, but...","It will be the last time we go. And it’s not because of anything they did wrong. In fact, they did a lot of things right and surpassed some pretty lofty expectations. We paid, online, and splurged for the platinum flash pass. As one intrepid worker explained to someone as to why we were going ahead, “the more you pay, the faster the line”. And we paid but we didn’t wait. Even as the day wore on pretty much everything was less than 5 minutes. And I rode everything. Some multiple times. X2 was a really strenuous ride but thrilling. The drop, thrilling. In fact every ride was fun and what we had hoped for. So why was it the last time? I’m 52. My gf is slightly younger. The rides just about maxed out endurance, and I’m a fit 52. Alas, as far as roller coasters go, I’m on the downward spiral.As far as the other things go: staff was outstanding. Knowledgeable and they stood their ground. There was a very loud pushy woman at the gate who swore she should be afforded some sort of line jump perk, but the supervisor handled her like a pro. Apologized for the confusion, refused to “escalate” it beyond her and put a shameless squawking patron in the back of the line where she belonged.The park was clean and we witnessed a well dressed man in a “director” badge picking up trash with a trash picker upper. Bathrooms were clean but my sole complaint would be not enough of them and each women’s room had a rather significant line.Food was as expected expensive but I heard people Rave about some meal pass. Some line confusion led to a longer than necessary wait at Chop Six, but no big deal.My last day ever of riding roller coasters was beyond fun and exceeded expectations.

50,pricey but fun,"Beware the pot smoking from employees behind the fences. Something they really need to deal with. Aside from that it was great. I wish we would have arrived at opening. We got three mid range flash passes. I figure we got an additional 4 rides out of it in six hours or so. The lines were long between 1 and 4:30 and then they just opened up and there was minimal waiting on a number of rides for the last 3.5 hours so the flash pass was pointless at that time, but one never knows how the day will pan out. It was a lot of walking because of the way we planned it out, we really felt it the next day. There was one ride that really banged my ears on the head rest. The X2 and Tatsu were awesome. I hadn't ridden that type before. I wouldn't do the flash pass if I lived nearby, but this was a one time opportunity so we wanted to ride as much as possible. My older sons were very happy and it was cleaner than they have seen in other six flags parks.",Matthew Y
10,Lines lines lines!,This place needs some work. There are long lines for everything from food to rides to the bathroom. And the app did not seem accurate. It said rides where open when closed and vice versa. Found one water fountain in the whole park! Service attendants were unfriendly and moved at a snails pace. Its so exciting when you drive into the park but overall a big disappointment! Wish management would pull it together.,vagabond97
50,Roller coaster heaven!,"Since I live on the East Coast it’s not easy to go to parks in California. I have been hearing about Six Flags Magic Mountain for more than 20 years now. Coaster Con 42 was held at SFMM this year and I couldn’t wait to visit!Coasters are everywhere...the only park I can compare it to is Cedar Point. The biggest difference Is how much more land SFMM has to still build. I will mention you need to be in pretty good shape as you constantly walk up and down the mountain! There are definitely some steep hills that are not made for everyone. The choice of coasters is amazing though. From my absolute favorite Twisted Colossus (which I rode 10 times) to the frightening X2 and Tatsu, to the rush of Full Throttle and Superman: Escape From Krypton to the inversions of Viper and Batman to the height of Goliath there really was so many thrills to be enjoyed. Six Flags also went above and beyond for Coaster Con. They couldn’t have been more accommodating. With all the ERT (exclusive ride time) they gave us to the amazing amounts of food they offered... we couldn’t have felt more special. The only downside to this entire trip was that West Coast Racers wasn’t complete yet...Which in turn closed down Apocalypse the Ride. I guess that just gives me another reason to have to return! If you love roller coasters you can’t possibly miss this park!",twhiffen

50,Best Six Flags Park and it's not even close,"We are a platinum season tickets for Six Flags and have visited a number of their parks over the last few years.Magic Mountain was our best experience, BY FAR!The staff was very friendly and interacted with the guests in a friendly way. Really nice variety of rides, especially roller coasters.Superman, Escape from Krypton was one of my favorites - 0 to 100 in 7 seconds, BACKWARDS as it climbs a vertical 400+ tower.Goliath is considered a ""hypercoaster"" with a 250+ drop and 85 MPH. Great air time and very, very smooth.Twisted Colossus is a hybrid coaster unlike anything I've ever ridden. It a ""racing"" coaster where, if the timing is right, trains race each other and riders will fly by each other sideways and over and under the other train.The New Revolution is 40+ years old, but still carries a punch.Gold Rusher is one of the smoothest mine trains I've ever ridden.X2 and Tatsu are both thrilling coasters, but both are a little rough for me, but the younger set may enjoy them.And there's lots more rides for all ages.",Hokiechip

10,Theme Park Meal Ticket Theft!!,I adopted a child 5 years ago and drove her down to meet her biological family. I purchased 18 park entrance tickets and 18 meal vouchers from the Six Flags Magic Mountain web site. At 6pm our group decided to find a place to eat at the park using their small provided list. We went to 3 places on the list and all 3 were already closed. We went to 2 more and they were out of food. We then went to the park office and were told there were no refunds even if all the places were closed. So I spent over $300 just on meal tickets that the park wouldn't refund or provide the food. Now I had 18 hungry people I had to feed outside the park which cost me an additional $200. NEVER EVER purchase these meal tickets from Magic Mountain! They will just steal your money. I am a disabled Navy tactical Chaplain and can afford to loose $500 just on a simple meal.,Todd F
40,Loved It!,"Been taking my daughter on theme park trips for over 10 years, and we finally made to west coast and this park has been high on list. Had a lot of variety of rides.

30,Maybe I'm getting too old for this...,"We visited Six Flags while on our honeymoon trip down the California coast. There's plenty of parking although it was filling up fast when we arrived not long after opening time. Getting into the park was easy and organised. Once inside, there are so many rides to choose from - we didn't have time to do them all. But I couldn't have done anyway, as I began to feel very bruised and battered. On Viper, there really should be signs to keep your head back against the seat (as there are with other rides) because my neck got pushed down so hard with the G-force that I thought it was breaking, and I could hardly move afterwards. Collossus was our favourite ride but you do get thrown around a lot as the seats only come up to your waist so there's no support for your upper body. All the rides felt a little less comfortable than those we have in the UK and I felt like I was maybe getting too old for rollercoasters (I'm 34) by the time we left!There are lots of options for food although drinks are quite limited so I ended up living off Diet Coke for the day. There are water fountains dotted all around which was good.A note on the flash passes - we purchased the gold level, but the regular one would have been enough due to the way they work. Try that and you can always upgrade later if you really want to.",Victoria S

50,Super fun!,Six Flags is amazing! The roller coasters are thrilling and fun. We visited the park in June and it was not too crowded. We waited on average 5-15 minutes for the rides. The Flash Pass is totally unnecessary.,Monica O
50,A day at the best amusement park in LA County,Even though over 48 years old this park is continuously evolving and adding new and enjoyable rides and attractions. Easy access and extensive choices for eating and drinking.,guastellap
30,"Ok theme park, but could be so much better","Six Flags Magic Mountain is just an OK theme park, depending on what you are looking to do.Pros:*A good variety of rides to keep everyone happy.* Some of the wait times are pretty reasonable. On Saturday at around 1pm, we walked on to the Batman ride and only had about a 10 minute wait for Riddler's Revenge.* Getting through security was quick without any real problems.* Even though it does get hot there, they do a good job providing lots of shady areas to site and cool off.Cons:* While the wait times for some of the rides is good, the wait time for any food place is horrible. We had three meals in the park during our weekend visit and each time it took 45 minutes or more to get through the line and order food. The lines for the smaller stands are just as bad.*There does not seem to be much focus on speeding up the wait time on some of the rides. For example, on Tidal Wave, they only had one boat going through the ride. So basically, you had to wait for the one boat to go through the whole cycle before it could be reloaded. Other rides had the same problem, with only one train going.Overall, my family had a good time and were able to do everything we wanted to in the two days we were there. However, it can be frustrating thinking about all the wasted time you burn because of the park's poor management.",California Dude
20,Lines all day,"The coasters are great. But the park really needs to improve operations.We waited in line almost an hour for tickets (couldn't buy online because we were getting a discount via a family member with a pass). All the ride lines were really long--60 to 90 minutes and more. The food lines everywhere were also ridiculously long. We waited in line for an hour to buy burgers, and the line just inched along. There were also lines for bathrooms, water fountains... you name it. In all, we spent a lot of money on tickets and spent most of the day in line. We go to a fair number of amusement parks, and this one was more disappointing than most despite the fun rides. It could be great if Six Flags hired more people and followed other parks' leads on how to manage crowds. As it is, we probably won't go again.",dephal

10,this place SUCKS.,"absolutely horrible. what a total rip off. not only are tickets expensive, but so is everything in here. $6 for a bottle of soda in the vending machine? come on. you also have to walk ridiculously far to get from one ride to another. lines don’t move, staff is rude af, everywhere is dirty, and people CONSTANTLY cut the line even though signs that say “no line cutting or you will be ejected from the park” are plastered everywhere. what a total waste of money. six flags, you suck. wish there was a 0 star rating option.",Rebecca M
50,Thrill seekers heaven,"Oh man they have the best, most extreme rides in so cal. From my experience the park was clean, they have friendly staff and I really recommend the annual pass platinum level gives you many perks like free parking, drinks, bring a friend free ticket, and many more perks for a low monthly cost.",Cisco c
10,Nasty,This place is nasty. The park is dirty and they do not keep up their older rides. They do not control the crowds or lines at all which meant long lines. Not at all that surprised seeing that it is a Six Flags park. Cedar Fair and Disney parks know how to keep up their rides and have staff directing riders to keep the lines down. Six Flags executives need to take advice from these parks. This is not that far from Disney Land and Knox Berry Farm. Pay a little more and go to a nice park that keeps their rides up and knows how to control crowds. I have also ridden more thrilling rides at other parks that are higher and faster. They advertise they have thrilling rides but they were pretty blah to me after having been to Cedar Point and Canada’s Wonderland. Definitely a park just for locals.,Tammy G
10,PET KENNEL,"This place has a B health rating and we should’ve left right when we saw it. They do not walk your dog to go potty so often times than not the pet ends up sitting in their own urine. The only ‘service’ they offer is for your pet to stay in a cage all day. I highly recommend not bringing your pets here, it’s a scary place for them to be. It’s basically a pound, they neglect the animals and provide no care. They should not be able to board animals here. Do your pet a favor and leave them at home or find a sitter. Free or not no animal should be treated this way.",Steph
30,Exciting looking rides.,"I could not give higher than 3. The park was crowded the day that we went. So we waited in lines for everything.When we arrived it was right at the time that the dining pass for lunch was about to end. We hopped in the first line we saw to beat the ending time.We stood in line almost an hour and a half to have disagreement with the cashier about whether we deserved to get the credit or not.Ultimately, we did get the credit, but it was not a pleasant situation.",Whereto2next

50,This amusement park is fantastic!,Magic Mountain is my favorite amusement park because of the plethora of large roller coasters. It is also clean and pretty. My grandsons and I went yesterday midweek and there were no lines to wait in. The coasters were amazing! We had the best t ime ever riding all of them!!!,Connie M
50,Arguably the best roller coaster park in the world!,"Let me make my valuation plain - my rating is for a pure roller coaster park and not for an amusement park (if the latter my rating would be below average). My two kids (13 and 10) loved every single ride but in particular X2 and Full Throttle. The park offers high speed roller coasters that really pumps your adrenaline! An absolute must for roller coaster ""junkies""! However, the park itself really needs a facelift. Compared to other amusement parks in the area there is no ""passion to the detail"". Anyway, we went there for the rides and were not disappointed.We purchased flash passes (platinum) and did not have to wait any minute. My kids did X2 three times in a row and Twisted Colossus four times during the entire day. However, on a workday the flash pass is not really needed. Or we might chose just a very quiet day. The food options were quite good.If you are looking for a pure roller coaster park Six Flags Magic Mountain is an absolute must. If you are looking for other things in an amusement park pick one of the other ones in SoCal.",Monty Stoller
50,Fun,Super fun at. Magic mountain. The park needs a face lift because it looks old . But the ideas are super fun! Love roller coasters!,Karen L
20,More like Tragic Mountain!,"Avid theme park enthusiast here; I've been all over the country with 30 different U.S. parks under my belt. While not the worst park I've been to, Magic Mountain was certainly the most disappointing.Flew here all the way from Philadelphia. Visited the park on a random Saturday in April, which initially didn't seem to be that busy based on the parking lot. Upon entering the park, we picked up our pre-purchased Gold Flash Passes and discovered that several major coasters were closed that day: Apocalypse, Ninja, and Full Throttle. We headed counter-clockwise...to the right. Within the first hour, we were able to ride Scream! and Twisted Colossus. Then we headed to the nearest restroom facility. There was a line for the men's restroom! Walked to another restroom, another line! I have never seen a line for a men's restroom before in any theme park in my entire life. Throughout the day, every restroom we visited had a line.We made our way to Riddler's Revenge and then started to look for our next Flash Pass ride. Because several of the coasters were not operating, the lines on the others, even with Flash Pass, were way too long. We had to prioritize based on the rides that were actually open and how long the lines were. We rode X2 next and then Revolution, and had now been in the park for four hours.We were hungry so we looked for a place to eat around 3PM. Every single food stall had an incredibly long line. Walked back to the front of the park to find the shortest line was for a healthy food place. After eating, Full Throttle finally opened so we jumped in line. The ride broke down shortly after getting in line but we waited it out.Now after over five hours in the park, we had only ridden SIX out of this park's supposed EIGHTEEN roller coasters.We spent more money on the Flash Pass than a park ticket, which we expect as avid park enthusiasts, but, unlike other parks who offer this type of program, we got very little use out of ours here.I cannot understand what all the hype is about with this park, which is world-famous. It was filthy. There were lines for everything: coasters, restrooms and food. The ride operations were terribly slow. You couldn't pay me to return here.",Scott H
40,Always a good time,6 flags is always a good time period we really love going and patronize both 6 flags in Vallejo California and this one. There's a lot to do if you have young children. I love the butterfly exhibit in Vallejo And of course always loved the log ride. Definitely worth the money and you can always get a discount online!,Dancingqueen555
50,Great place for insane high intensity thrills,"West coast racers construction is underway which is nice to see something new developing. Tatsu is probably one of my favorites because it's truly a unique ""flying"" experience. Love throwing my hands up all the way down Goliath too. Definitely the trill capital. Even the area for little tikes is fun. So many things to do for the whole family.",Joshua S
50,Family fun,My husband & I have memberships so we got our kids tickets half price. In the park we got discounts on food & merchandise. The lines were not super long & can't wait to go back@,Jessie M
40,Roller coaster fun,I took a dear friend for his birthday and we had a blast! We went on a Sunday in May and walked on most rides. Our longest wait was 30 minutes. Staff was friendly and the park was clean. Magic Mountain has been around awhile and I have come off and on for over 40 years. I do want to say - you pay a great deal less here than at Disneyland. If you want Disneyland quality then you'll pay Disneyland prices. if you want a fun day riding roller coasters - then this is the place for you.,Jolene B
50,Do you love roller coasters,"I'm not an extreme roller coaster person but my 10 year old granddaughter is and she loved all of them. I was flabbergasted what these rollercoasters can do now!! Our Embassy Suites across the street offered adult discount tickets which helped a lot, the parking is $25.00 I'm not sure if that includes in and out privilege so we used Lyft and saved $15.00. We were there on a Saturday all day and the longest wait was for the water rapid ride for 30 minutes and they got soaked soaked soaked lol Other than that we walked on every ride. No crowds, no lines. They have a small kids ride area which was really cute with several rides to go on. Theres lots of shopping and a game area like at a carnival. Average game cost $2.00. Theres a food court and food kiosks so you won't get hungry. I thought their prices were a little steep. $12.00 for a funnel cake. It was fun and my grandkids are looking forward to visiting again.",takemeaway50
40,"Fairly good, for coaster fans","Okay, so I struggle with some of the other reviews. I think some of them are out of shear annoyance or anger. I will try to be objective here. First, we are a six flags family. We live near six flags New England and have season passes, so this was an easy choice for us. Now, if you expect this to be a disney experience, forget about it. I don’t know why anyone would think they compare. It’s simply not the case.I am not sure how old the park is, but it clearly has been around a while...but I didn’t think it was an excessively dirty place. They are clearly putting money into the park to make enhancements and add more rides. So to me, maybe they have had off days, but all in all it was not considerably worse than many other parks we have been to.I do have one complaint...bring ear plugs if you plan on staying anywhere in the vicinity of the superman ride. I swear they have to be pumping in a jet engine sound (I test fighter jet engines and it was excessively loud for me!). I can’t understate how loud it was. I have never in my life heard such a loud roller coaster. It made being on that side of the park unbearable.With that stated, I generally liked the park. Prices were, maybe a little high, but to me, I just chalked that up to being in California, so I wasn’t really surprised. One thing that was very nice was the shading. There is plenty of vegetation throughout to help keep you cool wherever you are.All in all, it was a fairly good experience. I would certainly go back if I were in the area.",Jamie D
10,Incredibly Unresponsive Customer Service,"While the park is fun while quite pricey, the issue arose when we had a problem. Food was especially expensive ($6 for a bottle of water at a vending machine) and the lines for food were long. But that wasn't the problem. When we lost a phone that flew out of a back pocket on Twisted Colusses we immediately reported it to Lost and Found. They were especially friendly and stated that an evening search for lost items is conducted every night and they would get back to us with the results. There was no response from them after that evening. We then located the phone using Google and pinpointed the GPS location in the park near the ride. We drove to the park (they didn't answer the phone) and showed them where it was and they said they would do another search that night. Still no response from them. After repeated attempts to contact them to no availe we have come to the conclusion that Customer Service is a low priority. Please note that there are no warnings that even putting items in your pocket is no guarantee of safety of the item and I would forewarn potential customers to get a good fanny-pack to put your valuable in since many of the rides are quite radical. The poor customer service is very disappointing considering that the 5 of us probably spent over $1250 in the park that day. It is unfortunate that just a little effort on their part would address our issue but it appears that the responsibility but not the authority rests in the hands of minimum wage employees with no sense of concern. It is interesting that since this event we have had conflicting stories from the Magic Mountain personnel regarding the processes for searching for and returning the items lost on rides. The people responsible for conducting the searches state the search is is relaxed and casual with no discipline or technical/scientific approach. The higher-ups claim it is thorough and disciplined. In the extensive time since the phone was lost we can still confirm its location in the park - but Magic Mountain appears to not care.",Zoomie70
10,Worst day evee,"Total waste of money we went to California from the UK for a holiday and thought we would go, most of the roller coasters were closed, food is extortionate and you can’t take your own food in , $7 for a bottle of water $16 for a portion of chicken nuggets and chips, pay the extra and go to universal it’s so much better. No refund policy so all they gave us were passes to go again but we are back in the uk now so can’t use them, Avoid this place!",Claudine T
40,Great fun!,"A fun, thrill seeking day out! Wait times for rides can take time and blow out to over an hour. If you are happy to leave your bag while riding, there is space at each ride but you do so at your own risk. Lockers are available but will mean that you don’t have easy access to money for drinks etc. My advice is to have a small stash of cash you can securely carry ( where it won’t fall out) as some vendor stalls will only accept cash. Good fun for all the family",Holly W

40,"It's all about the rides! 5* thrills, average everywhere else.","Well, it surely isn't Disney! Compared to the Mouse House in all it's incarnations, this is very much second best (or third, or fourth...). We were there on a quiet day, and with many stalls and some attractions closed. Not many staff, so-so service (varying from ""leisurely"" to ""really can't be bothered doing anything at all"") although there were some friendly and enthusiastic exceptions on Crazanity and Riddler in particular, so-so cleanliness, queuing areas in need of a refresh, uninspired merchandising (although prices on merch were much lower than others I've seen).BUT, and this is a huge, ma-hoosive, neon-illuminated BUT, the rides. Oh my life, the rides. Extreme, brain-shaking, stomach-churning, nerve wracking lunacy around every corner. Twisted Colossus and X2 border on sadism. No other park I've attended has anything like that sort of range, with so many top-notch thrill offerings, and all for a fraction of the price of some other big names. If they prioritise the coasters over the queuing areas and the burger joints, I can live with that!Now sort out some decent fridge magnets? Please?",Richard P
10,Inefficient,Everything is slow (from getting a soda to a ride) and poorly managed.The lines literally stop moving for hours.Getting a soda takes about 40 minutes because there is just one person doing everything and this person has to assemble the bottles. The bottles are big so filling them with a soda takes a lot of time.The park is also dirty.,MomJMR
50,Super awesome!,"Planned a trip for my daughter for spring break. It was her first time at the park as well as first rollercoaster theme attraction. I bought the flash pass which definitely came in handy as we were able to go on every ride. It wasn’t busy in the morning, but did get pretty packed later on. Definitely will be going back.Only thing that was bad. Most of the picture reviews were not up. And some staff weren’t trained all the way to handle ride malfunctions.",joshl3408
30,Great coasters but...,"Six Flags Magic Mountain is definitely the thrill capital of the world when it comes to roller coasters. However, the park itself is in need of some major upgrades from the ground up, literally. I am a Disney person and I guess I hold everything to Disney standards. SFMM has disgusting restrooms, their food isn't even good - I always eat before and after we are in the park and bring light snacks (when they don't make me throw them away) to hold us over. The entire park could use new paint, new concrete on the ground, updated restrooms, better food and so much more. I feel like they spend top dollar for these coasters yet neglect the appearance of the park as well as the food and basic maintenance. I do love the roller coasters though and for that reason I have a membership and still come back.",DisneyGirl417
30,Trip with teens,"Hey, it's just like most of the reviewer's said - the coasters are fierce, wild, innovative and amazing. So if that's all that matters, this is your place. But man, this park is dirty. Run down, sagging, tired and not at all maintained. The bathrooms are stained, are missing paper and soap...the sidewalks are cracked, broken and everywhere there's peeling paint, graffiti and just...filth. Old gum, the seats of the coasters are furry with dirty and yes: old vomit. Check out the platform of Tatsu - a multi-colored rainbow of dried barf. Also, this ain't Disney - the employees are unprofessional and kind of lazy in that cars ran only partially full, etc. I complained to one guy about the rampant line jumping and the worker laughed, saying, yeah that happens. So the place is gross, but hey, enjoy the rides.",Rebecca I
50,Fun place for Roller Coasters,"Very fun, long lines so I would recommend going on a weekday. Can ride with no wait on those days. Clean and well organized, friendly staff and prices are high but nothing unexpected.",Rbhickson99
10,Disappointed,"We were really excited about going to the theme park. On arrival we asked at the front gate if all the rides were open the member of staff said 2 were not running. However, this was not the case when we were in. Only to find 4 out of the 12 maximum thrill rides were open, 3 out of 5 were open on the moderate rides and 5 out of 7 of the other rides. So as a result less than half the parks rides were open. After queuing for 2 rides the twisted colossus and tidal wave both broke down.The food was massively over priced 5 small chicken crispy strips and fries a medium coke $21. Which was disappointing because no food or drinks are aloud to be taken in. We left feeling very deflated and underwhelmed.",Andy T
40,Lots of coasters but long wait times,"We were excited to go to this park to experience the coasters. We went in April 1st & didn’t expect it to be as busy as it was. We arrived at 11am, waited about 1/2 hour to get entrance I to the park & found that most of the good thrill rides had wait times of approximately an hour. We waited in line 1.5 hours for X2 but admittedly they were giving announcements that only 1 carriage was running which resulted in the delays. If your into thrill rides then this park is worth the visit, otherwise give it a miss. Tatsu was terrifying but awesome",Sarah P
50,Fun for my teens,"It was as expected...crazy rollercoasters! The park map includes ratings for each rollercoaster which made it easy to manage our time and focus on the ""scarier"" rides that my teens enjoyed. We were able to get through all the rides in one day.",shernandez710

Me & my husband & two kids arrived & were hoping to have a great day there.Went on one ride clear across the park from where you get the Flash Pass,After the first ride we went to go on another ride 7 & the bracelet said deactivated. Needless to say we weren't happy having to trek across the entire park to get our Flash pass bracelet fixed which took 25 min each way to get that far into the park.When I got to the Flash pass center where you get them their rude Employee's Asked ""Would you like to speak with a Manager"" I responded ""No I'd like a damn ride in a Golf cart to where I was when this thing stopped working"". All they did was laugh which just made it worse will never go back $500.00 gone all because their dumb electronic bracelet wouldn't work! SMH!",Julie M
40,Great Rollercoaster Park,Good- Large selection of rollercoasters 15+- Majority of rides had 5-10 minute wait timesBad- Very long waits for rides X2 & Goliath due to six flags only running 1 train per ride (from other trip advisor reviews this seems to be a recurring theme).Suggestions- Go early (park opens at 10) and do X2 & Goliath first,Adam I

40,Better trip this time!,"It has been 2 years since our last visit to MM. We used to have 6 Flags season passes, but burned out at Discovery Kingdom and did not renew. For this visit, we purchased tickets through AAA and were at the general admission line 1 hour before opening. We went on a Friday and left before closing. We rode 13 rides, with our longest wait of 1 hour for X2. It seemed only one train was running for each attraction because the crowd level was low. We walked onto a few rides. I loved having incredible walking space all around us. A couple of times, we felt completely alone! The park was cleaner that our last visit. Only one ""line jumper"" and it was a mom with 2 small boys that I could only think ""bathroom break"", so it was forgiven. Last visit had a dozen teen line jumpers.CraZanity was absolutely amazing! Justice League, Battle for Metropolis, was an excellent attraction. My daughter and I actually got a little motion sickness at the end scene.. A very new experience for us after hundreds of rides between 6 Flags and Cedar Point. All of our favorites were up and running and showing well cared for. We met Porky Pig and had our very first funnel cake. An exhausting and thoroughly fun day.",Amy H
40,"Great park, gread rides, great staff!","Visited with teen son and we had a great time. The park was clean and well maintained, the rides were great, but most of all we found the staff to be very courteous, friendly and professional! Rides staff was wonderful at handling our disability pass, they seem to be well trained and very courteous, unlike other experiences we have had at other parks. Our only overall complaint about the park was the price of water (2 for $10 wow!). We ended up buying the drink cups for the day just for water because we drink lots of it and unfortunately the drink station on the back of the park was closed. That led to a lot of walking to go back to the front station to refill and long lines at restaurant to refill. Other than that, we had a great time!",tripeo
10,"LONG WAIT FOR BROKEN RIDES, MANY RIDES BROKEN, ENTIRE FAMILY DISSAPOINTED","We drove 2 hours each way to visit this park, to be extremely disappointed buy the entire experience. Many of the rides were broken down. We waited 45 minutes in a line, just to be told when we got to the front that another ride was broken down.

I've never had such a bad experience at an amusement park. Very sad.",Lauren

I love the Collosus redo, but my kids love Tatsu and. Now the CraZannity pendulum has my 16 year old hooked.The park has a reasonable selection of typical amusement park food, but is a difficult place for food allergies. The restaurant staff has no clear listings to help, so either call in advance or bring your own food and know you’ll have to explain why.Older kids (14+) should be fine navigating the park on their own - we stayed there and let them go off on their own in groups of 2 or 3. Try to go on off days or at the beginning or end of the day.We had a great day.",DONNA E
40,Great trip,"Me and the boyfriend went here on presedents day 2019 and had a really great time. For a holiday the crowds were pretty small, only had to wait over 15 min for maybe 2-3 rides. Some rides had no lines and we went straight on. Winter hours were short, only open from 11-6 so we were only able to go on the largest thrill rides in that time frame. The rides themselves were absolutely amazing, just so much fun. My only other negative comments would be how inaccurate the app is and how often rides were closed. Half the time it would say a ride was closed when it wasn’t, or the wait time was 30 min off. We found it was better just to go and visually see the line. I get rides shut down but it seemed that there was always a few shut down at a time. Overall we had a great time and would totoaly go again",Alicia D
10,What a joke,"This place is so sad. It was once fun, now it’s just run down and sad. There is hardly anyone here, but the lines for food are still 45 minutes because only one cashier at each place. Half of the food places are closed. The ride lines are long for the rollercoasters because only one car is operating at a time. At 4pm two consecutive food venues had no ice, but still want $6 for a small drink and one stand was out of drinks all together. The ONLY redeeming part to this hell hole is that the smaller children’s rides are little to no wait. Skip it if you don’t have to go. It’s not a must see...or even have to see...it’s basically a roadside attraction at this point.",DesertMomma3

40,Kids Heaven,"Nothing is more pure fun than Six Flags Magic Mountain and Hurricane Harbor. Start your day early with roller coasters and end it splashing in an awesome water park. Do not expect to bring any snacks as they force you to pay horrendous prices for the worlds worse unhealthy food. Eat light as the combination of greasy low quality food and roller coasters can result in technicolor explosions. And expect to be hot, real hot. On a California summer day , if you are prone to heat stroke, this may not be your best choice.",nielsh928
50,Crazanity is awesome..,Had a great time. The line for Crazanity takes quite a bit of time but the ride is well worth the wait..,Rhazy E
30,Spring Break,"Overall we had a pretty good day at Six Flags. Our kids we're disappointed at the amount of rides that we're closed. Some were due to the wind, some for the season but others just seemed old and run down. Seeing as this is probably our last trip we popped for the platinum flash pass. It was a good deal for a one time visit. Their website says you get to use it many times for some rides and it comes with a band for remaining on some rides. Not so and you only get to use it once per ride, It was still fun and our kids made it on every ride that was open. I would definitely recommend it if you can afford it, definitely makes a one time visit more enjoyable. One of our kids had casts on both arms and was able to ride most rides. There were just a couple of them where the operators wouldn't let him ride. When questioned about it they said each ride has different policies.",BrookHaines
40,Decent Coasters,"We didn't stay long because my daughter wasn't feeling well and it was a very hot day in August, but we did enjoy a couple of the roller coasters. Tatsu, the coaster that straps in your legs and rotates you to horizontal, face down (kind of a Superman ""flying position"" before launch) was a unique experience.",Karen O

We were going in i guess their 'off season' (winter). We basically got on every ride straight away, i think we had to wait for a grand total of 5 minutes on one of the more popular rides. If we wanted to we could of stated on the same coaster all day the park was that dead.We got on every ride and were done by about 1400 (2pm).My tip:Go in winter if you hate lines. I saw a few lines with a sign saying 'from here 4 hour wait'. wow.give yourself a day there if you have a group of you going.Pre purchase tickets and parking.",Todd S
40,Great for Thrill Seekers!!!,I forgot how much fun roller coasters are! I used to love them as a kid but I love them even more as an adult! My kids had a little trouble handling some of these rides. The actual theme park is a little messy but overall I was happy with the rides.,Tommy K
40,The best coasters!,"This place has the best roller coasters on the planet but the place seems to have been degraded somewhat since i last went. lots of fun rides and still a great experience, had a funnel cake on the way out which was amazing",Regina
50,Boy’s 11th birthday party at the park- success!,"We had an awesome time at the park celebrating my son‘s 11th birthday party! My husband and I did not go on any rides, but our group of kids ages 10 to 13 had a blast! We purchased the birthday party package option and bought a photo package and the medium level flash pass. The value on the birthday party package is awesome! I would encourage you to read the fine print on the meal vouchers as only specific items from specific restaurants are offered. We had a little trouble finding a restaurant that would honor the voucher for chicken tenders… We were turned away from one restaurant because they only offered a four piece basket of tenders whereas the voucher is good for a three-piece basket of tenders. That was a bit frustrating, but The next restaurant, Katy’s Kettle we went to… Across the park… Accommodated our vouchers with their four piece basket and they were very friendly and helpful.The flash pass was a really fun thing for my son to be in charge of during the day of his party. He said it saved the group so much time, it was well coordinated and overall was incredible. Although it added a bit of an expense for the six kids riding, we thought the value is worth it during our experience at the parkAnd we loved the funnel cake vouchers… We got funnel cake at the very end of the day as we were leaving the park. A lot of people seem to do that, so be ready for a longer line as the park closes at the funnel cake restaurant. However it’s worth the wait!",ErinHBrown
50,"forget Disneyland,THIS is the happiest place on earth!","Magic Mountain is honestly my favorite amusement park!Rides: the rides are always (for the most part) up and running. This time, I wasnt able to go on my favorite ride (Superman). But it's ok. Is the off- season, and I'd rather it be closed now, than be closed when it's super busy.Food: The food is really good, but quite pricey. They do offer meal passes, though, and they pay for themselves in a couple of trips.Employees: The employees are always super friendly and helpful. Diana from Membership services helped my mom and I upgrade our passes. She was very patient and knowledgeable.As an amusement park worker, myself, I can say that I really do appreciate all of the hard work that goes into keeping guests satisfied. Is nice to go somewhere and know that i'm going to be taken care of, and feel safe and confident in my surroundings.",Ashcaldwell714
50,Best Rush Ever!!!,"I took the boys back to Magic Mountain. We liked it so much we bought a season pass! So that is a bonus! We went on a Monday when they didn't have school. It was great. NO lines that were extremely long! We went on every scary (for me:) ) ride possible and just had a blast. I would definitely recommend anyone that likes fast, adventurous rides to check it out.",Kathy C
40,Fun place,Great family place. Fun for everyone. Different size rides so from small kid to adults all can have fun,ritz
50,Are you a ride lover?,"If you love roller coasters and other rides to thrill you, make you dizzy and possibly vomit, this is the place for you.",as4beatles
50,Roller coaster Capital!,There's so many thrilling roller coasters here! I couldn't believe how many rides there were. And each one thrilling and different.I didn't like how hilly the park was. It was hard to push a stroller up to the top part of the park.I'd recommend going on X2 last because it bangs your head around alot and people tend to get headaches after it.,Amanda454
30,Getting too hectic,"Santa Clarita is about an 1 hour and a half away from bustling metropolis of Los Angeles. This is the quiet city that Six Flags Magic Mountain is locates. It’s a wonderful place where teenagers or adults can visit. The rides are not intended for under 13 years old. They are frightening rides. The theme park is great, but when you have hundred of thousands of young teenagers and adults congregating together it’s not a good idea. The park just can not maintain enough security with all the fracas that goes on. Los Angeles is gang capital of the world, and they love to cause drama when seeing one another. I would highly recommend to be aware of your surroundings at the park.",CambodiaTravelsGuide.com

50,Be warned,"If you suffer from motion sickness dont go, if you dare to challenge yourself, go. This place is full of high thrilling rides. I started with the smaller rides then got to the more faster ( scarier ) rides. The Crazinity ride ended it for me. I left my stomach in the air.",Simon Fruean
50,Tons of Coasters,"This is a fun park for teens and adults. Lot's of thrill rides but not much for small children. There's a water park next door. Fright Fest is pretty cool, nothing scary but, definitely entertaining.",Melsurf165
40,"Thrilling rides, bit of a headknocker","We had a great day here and it was super empty so there were no lines which was great! The rides were going great until our 3rd ride we went on- X2 - which was a super headknocker and gave us all bad headaches and sore necks that every other ride we went on afterward made it quite sensitive. I enjoyed the Full Throttle the most, it was a thrilling ride. Would recommend there to be more head support and cushioning to prevent hard head jerks",Lucy
30,Another Park Checked,"We are a roller coaster family and love expanding our list of visited parks and checking roller coasters off our checklist. We are from Ohio and frequent Cedar Point on a regular basis (20+ times a year) and love experiencing new parks as well as rides.Six Flags Magic Mountain was one of four parks (Knott's Berry Farm, California's Great America, and Six Flags Discovery Kingdom were all on our itinerary) we visited on our California amusement park tour.Loved the number and variety of roller coasters. This has been one of the only other parks we have found that is comparable to Cedar Point with number and variety of roller coasters. Loved the dining plan we purchased with our season pass that also got us snacks during the day. Dole whip was great!The biggest down side of any Six Flags parks - including this one - we visited this summer were the workers. LONG food lines! Not a single worker fulfilled any order (even the simplest one from an ice cream cart) with speedy purpose here. Workers took ridiculous time to do the simplest of tasks - refilling a drink.We've never seen ride operators load a train of riders with such apathy. The lines at this park could be DRASTICALLY decreased if the workers would try to load trains with any care to get the line and train moving. We've been to multiple other parks (8 parks in total this summer alone) where the ride operators run from car to car to check harnesses to allow for maximum ridership and low wait times - NOT HERE. Workers casually stroll from car to car - stop to chat up their fellow workers - trains return to the station after completing a coaster circuit and sit before they even begin to check harnesses.This park is also lacks an overall clean atmosphere. Gum stains all over walkways. Coasters placed in parking lots with no efforts to landscape. Hats/trash/belongings flying off of coasters never collected at the end of the day to make restricted spaces under coasters appear clean. Trash left by guests all over the park and no cleaning crew to pick it up during the day. Gum stuck to walls inside of line queues. It is these little touches that can take a park from okay to great.",RideMoreCoasters
50,Roller coaster Heaven❤️,"What an amazing roller coaster park..... I mean that’s really all it is for adults, of course kids have quite a few rides and being winter in USA most of the water rides were closed, however if you love the fast loops, the high drops, the utter thrills then this place is definitely worth a visit.We paid for the gold pass..... as an international visitor and no chance to return anytime soon, it was totally worth the extra money.Yes some rides were closed, I’d prefer them to be safe than open when they aren’t. Some reopened during the day whilst we were there and given the all clear.Thrill seeker.... definitely go there!!!!! I loved it.The X2 is the best I’ve ever been on:)",melissajanderson
40,Thrilling rides...so so park.,"First of all, it was HOT when we visited. Not many places in the shade. The staff was not very friendly. The lines for food were over an hour wait. Once I received my food, it was 20 min before I was able pay for my food, so I ate my food while standing in line before I paid! Six Flags is not the best at customer service. The lines for rides were also long. Of course, as expected the rides were great! Very limited theming and many advertisments everywhere.",Freckles25000
40,Rides even for toddlers available,Bug Bunny Land for toddlersLines not as long as Disneyland.Food cheaper too.Airplane ride similar to riding Dumbo.Ride similar to tea cups but height limit prevents adults going on ride.Family meal plan good value.,margarita
50,Happiness,"This place is not a theme park, but rather a roller coaster park. Great customer service, lovely rides and always good vibes. The only comment I have would be that some rides hurt while you are on them ( X2, twisted colosus..etc.) my favorite is always golliath.",Ahmed J
50,Roller Coaster INSANITY!!,"If you love roller coasters, you need to visit Six Flags Magic Mountain. There are so many roller coasters; we didn't even get close to riding them all. Beyond the number of coasters, there are so many cool, different types. There are coasters you sit in, coasters you ride standing up, coasters you hang from, coasters you are flying, backwards, forwards, upside down, and occasionally right side up!!!Add it to your trip. A short drive out from LA (hourish) to have your mind blown and your stomach turned.Tickets are a bit cheaper if you buy online, in advance, for a specific date. Expect to spend all day there because, unless the lines are short, there is no way to finish all the rides. You can check attendance trends on the amusement park crowd tracker website, and hit the popular coasters first thing because it only gets busier. I was there on a Sunday in January and the longest line may have been about 45 mins.",Trey C
30,We had great day at the park,"Everything in the park was great, short queues, fast service, many roller coasters and amazing time. But also to add, some places need the repair very much, for example you have water leaking on peoples heads from the water attraction tubes, because they are just with many many holes.But besides that, all the coasters looks really safe and people working there are really helpful and professional.",Karliooze
10,middle school delight,The middle school kids love this place but it's just rides. No imagination. No interesting places to eat or shop. Lots of walking uphill. These grandparents will stay home next time and not waste their money. Even the kiddie are rides are boring to go on with the little ones. (Except for the one merry go round),dorothy96734
30,Bring your own food!,The food lines are way to long and the food is not worth the price. The food is worse than fast food like McD's or W's. The signs for the food type are not accurate. You can get some food types at any of the windows. They could open more windows but don't!!,pjeffyp
50,Adrenalin,This place is the best roller coaster park in the world?? (personal opinion) I can't get enough of this place. It has some of the best coasters around. You will not be disappointed if you go. Recommend going in the quiet season. I went in April and it was quiet and very good. All the rides still operate and now it is open every day. Be aware that you can't take food into the park. That check your bags at the gate and you need to throw your food in the bin or eat it out the front before you enter. For me that is a small compromise for what's installed when you enter. Understand it's frustrating if you have small children. But not a good place for small children anyway as most of the rides are for around 11 or older depending on height.,GHP73
40,Quite a bit closed,"A great park with many thrill rides but at this time of year much of the parks facilities are closed.Great weather no rain, few rides closed, no shows on and many vending /kiosks shut I guess because it’s quiet.Rides that were open were great but many not for the faint hearted or those scared of heights.Ma great day teenagers loved itBook online the day before and we got a discount on tickets.Food was priced ok for a theme park and they give free cups of water if needed.",TravelBugz777
40,Roller Coaster Dream,"Been coming here since I was a teenager. Now, they have all kinds of roller coasters to ride. I never get tired riding them.",Raniel M
40,A bit of a come-on but the kids loved it,"Went as the guest of a famuly I was visiting which has membership cards. But because it was on Sunday I had to pay half price rather than get a complimentary free pass -- although it was advertised in all the posters at the entrance to the park as ""every day"", it is not on weekends...On the other hand, in the small children's part of the park there is a Disney-like performance of life-sized chatacters everyday ... you guessed it, except Sundays.Not nice to charge more on weekends and give less.",bfindysz
50,Would go again,"A really good experience, a really thrilling day we went on all major coasters apart from x2. We bought the fast pass which is brilliant hardly had to wait for rides. Food is expensive but it’s a theme park it’s going to be. If I have time when I’m in America next I would re visit. But take warm clothing it was really windy and cold. Go early to avoid long queues.",christinekaur
50,Awesome!,"Awesome! We had a great time. Go on a Sunday and in the fall or winter to avoid long lines. X2 and Tatsu were the best rides, in my opinion, and the Wooden roller coaster was the “sleeper” ride. So much fun.",C R G
40,FUN FUN FUN,"well worth the flash pass 120$ if not , you will be waiting for 90 minutes a ride. we did not wait very long for any rides. some not included.. but enough for us have a lot of fun ... but getting in the door was an ordeal . we got groupon LA GO PASS. had to wait in guest services, for 45 min, then the entry for 30 min. they need a fast pass for entry.",Charles W
50,This is where I want to be buried when I die,Absolutely undoubtedly the most amazing theme park in the world. Ever. No long queues. The coasters are the best. We did 16 coasters in 12 hours. Open until 1am. This is utopia. Discovery Kingdom is great but Magic Mountain is phenomenal.,David N
20,Health Hazard,"Ok well the rides speak for themselves. You can’t find thrill like this ANYWHERE ELSE. It just sucks because many rides are only open when the weather is optimal. That makes the long lines even longer when more people are waiting to get on even less rides. But I guess for safety reasons, this is to be expected and is a hazard of the business.My problem has to do with something that is a serious health hazard and they should know better.We all know not to drink the water from the tap in California. Their water actually comes from a joint state effort from Colorado. Colorado uses their clean water, then their sewage goes through pipes under the state through to Arizona, who then “cleans” the sewage to use as their municipal water. Then their sewage runs to California to be “cleaned” and used there. So California tap water is sewage that was cleaned and recylcled TWICE before it made its way to their taps. Don’t believe me? Seriously google it. I’m not making this up. So what does this have to do with 6 Flags??I’m glad you asked. When I ordered a soda there, I immediately noticed that it tasted “funny”.... like tap water. Keep in mind that I’m from Hawaii and moved to Washington state, so I know what clean water is supposed to taste like. So anyway, I went into the store and asked them where do they get their water to make their soda. Sure enough, they said they just use regular tap water. OMG I wanted to throw up. Keep in mind you are walking around for hours, oftentimes in the scorching sun. Not to mention, your throat gets dry from all that screaming you’ll be doing.... so you will definitely need to stay hydrated... AND they do not allow you to bring outside drinks. That leaves you with 2 options; either drink their nasty sewer water sodas or pay their inflated prices for clean water (something like $10 for a measly puny 16oz bottle of water which you will need every few hours x the number of guests in your group). Seriously, the price for clean water will far exceed their already ridiculously high entrance fee.Someone should seriously report this to some type of Board of Health. Shame on you Six Flags!",Sabrina B
40,Very Good Rollercoasters,"I've been both here and Cedar Point. To start, I would say that CP has better Rollercoasters. That is not to say that SFMM has bad ones, I would just say that I liked CP better. The best rides in my opinion were Twisted Colossus, Goliath and X2. There are two big things that I really do not like here.1. The parking is FOREVER away from the entrance. Consider placing a new entrance(or at least an exit only gate) between Scream and TC2. The food prices are WAYYYYYYYYYYYY to high. I paid $20 for 2 slices of pizza, and that's with my membership discount. It would've been cheaper for me just to order pizza and have it delivered.My number one tip to those who are planning on coming here: Come at night, it is way less crowded.",Jamie D
40,"Fun, emotional, excited",Every time in LA try to visit this place. Absolutely amazing feeling when you enter the park and fall into cheerful atmosphere.Definitely need renovation on some attractions but in general- good.,Swimpower
10,Disgusting,This park need a ton of TLC! Put some money back into the grounds and eating areas and disgusting bathrooms! No park should be this dirty! All... every single seat is ripped or torn... and this has been there for a very long time! Bathrooms do not flush and are disgusting....I hope they maintain there tides better than the rest of the park. I’m telling you GROSS! Six Flags in NJ is emasculate! No excuse for this. A lot of rides were closed and nothing posted at entrance. Kids area..... YUCK! DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME. Go to Universal Studios.... 🤢🤮,Tanya P
40,Choose your visit date wisely!,"Magic Mountain is a great park with lots of satisfying thrill rides, and you can maximize your experience by choosing the right day to visit. I went on Thursday, September 6, 2018, and had the best theme park experience of my life. The place was nearly empty, and I waited 5-10 minutes max to get on any ride. Only a couple rides were closed, and I rode every open ride at least twice (4 times on Goliath). By contrast, I visited the park on Thursday, December 27, 2018, and had a much less enjoyable experience. The place was packed, with 2-hour average wait times. Plus, nearly half the rides were closed, making it seem even more crowded. I wouldn't even consider going on a weekend any time of the year. Tuesday-Thursday when school is in session seems to be the best bet.",Brian M
50,Holiday In the Parks,"What a wonderful experience! Great live entertainment, fabulous lights, specialty foods, gifts and SNOW! All this and, if you want, the greatest thrill rides of ant theme park with Bugs Bunny World for little thrill seekers!",Mary S
50,Excellent,Great experience! Worth every dime. If you want to ride as much as possible without waiting times I strongly recommend to visit in the wintertime weekdays. Even then time is flying as much as yourself....,Lenzenbach
10,An Important Notice to the Ride Staff at the Park,"A VERY IMPORTANT NOTE: I rode X2 today it was only running one train as the line was down the ramp, staff wouldn't let you pick which side you wanted to ride on the line was in the hot sun and team manager Susan only admitted one small group into the station at a time, and worst of all there will be an assigned seating policy in the near future. Signs are already up stating you cannot pick your row. This is bad because X2 is much smoother in the front seat and if you ride in the middle or back you can get a painful ride. I'm extremely disappointed with Magic Mountain as they used to allow to choose whatever seat you wanted. The same goes for Full Throttle which I don't ride anymore because you can't pick your seat. And as with X2 certain seats are better in Full Throttle's case the back seat and in X2's the front. And if you don't ride in these certain seats you can get a sub par, forceless, or even a painful experience. (I am a season passholder I visit all the time)",Coaster C
10,Dirty and crap service,"Some of the rides are OK (if you like lines) but the customer service is beyond crap, the food was so disgusting we had to throw it out and the dining rooms they expect you to sit in to eat the slop look like they have never been cleaned. We left early as we had just had enough! Won't go back.",ChaninaBanina
50,Great Time,"Great time to buy a membership. Platinum for the price of Gold. It’s a great value. We brought the meal option the comes with Lunch, dinner and snacks also unlimited refills. The rides were awesome and the lines were not long however we probably went at a time when most kids were in school. They do offer a fast pass option and it may be something we look into when we go and it’s more crowed.",Victor S
40,One of the best 6 Flags!,"Great mix of roller coasters and extreme rides, the thrill seeker can't go wrong at Magic Mountain. Nice alternative for older kids (teens) who are bored with ""little kid rides"" at Disneyland.",Jerry Crawford
40,Super time,"I guess we visited at a good time. Rode every ride available, (several good ones down for maintenance), lots of hills so prepare to walk a lot. Meal deal was worth it. 2 meals, a snack and all day drinks for $34. Favorite rides were X2, Full Throttle, and Goliath... well worth admission.",Joe G
40,Best rollercoaster rides ever!,"We must have chosen a great day to go, it was a Friday, a day after some really stormy weather so the park was not that busy. My son brought me here, we ended up having a great day out! Some of the rides and food vendors were closed, but it did not spoil the day as there was plenty of rides to go on! We went on all the extreme rides, X2, Goliath, Tatsu, Riddlers revenge etc - some we went on twice! Full Throttle was my son's favourite ride; X2 was mine. We ate lunch at the Sports Bar, nothing really special, usual burgers and onion rings! This place does look a little tired in places; the toilets could do with a good deep clean (generally). Another small gripe was that there was no separate queues to fill your soda cups (the souvenir cups); you had to queue with everyone getting their food, so it took ages just to get a refill, management should look at this. All in, a great day out with some great memories - I think it is worth going out of season to beat the queues!!",OriginalSoulGirl

20,"Rides were fun, rude workers all around.",First time to magic mountain park with our family and we were there for some family fun time. While shopping I asked a worker for help and she rudely tells me “I’m off the clock but you can wait for someone else to help you” while she helped her friends who were paying for some merchandise (probably giving them a discount). I waited for the other worker and asked her on a price and that same work who rudely told me she could not help me answered her question. I told the manager within a few minutes after and he was no help at all. I put all my things down and left. Absolutely horrible customer service.,Maps66100247130

Loved the last ride so much I got a T-Shirt of it at the Emporium to remember it by.We were able to get a FastPass which certainly helped a great deal as the lines for some rides were ridiculous and the maintenance for some of them were VERRY slow and inefficient. Service in the park as a whole could be better, the bathrooms for example had wet floors and there were some shabby areas here and there.Regardless of those issues, I still had a great day with my family and look forward to more thrills in the future!",Colby S

30,For roller coaster lovers,"Very recommended for roller coster lovers since you will experience a lot of emotions on up to 25 different roller coasters. I personally prefer Universal and Disneyland there you can choose variety of entertainment, here it’s all about roller coasters. Gold pass will save your time so you can enjoy more rides in one day. It is recommended to buy tickets online, so you can save up to 20 dollars and you don’t have to waste time in line at the park.",Надежда Т
50,Super fun!!!,"I went with my grandson's team (Football) to celebrate end of season and end of pee wee season for him since he is now a freshman in High school we experience low lines at most rides allowing us to got back in some of the rides, food was inexpensive and good !!!",coolgradmaof10
10,No Flags Rubbish Mountain,"We were visiting California from the UK and were very much looking forward to our day at Magic Mountain, having pre-booked online weeks before visiting. This cost us $65 each, and with a 'processing fee', this totalled $138.97 for the two of us. Not a cheap day out, by any means, but we'd heard positive things about Six Flags in the USA and, as thrill-seekers, we wanted to experience the rides Magic Mountain had to offer. We have visited many theme parks across the US, and the world, and have never experienced such poor customer service as we did in Six Flags Magic Mountain on the day in question.We were quite taken aback to see that the park didn't open until 10:30AM, with a closing time of 6PM (despite no Fright Fest in the evening), but we hoped this would mean it would be a low-visitor day and so it wouldn't be busy. We arrived at the park shortly before 10:30AM and paid the, what I consider to be extortionate, $25 parking fee. We encountered our first member of staff at the gate. The second member of staff we encountered was the male who guided me into the parking space he wanted me to park in. We walked up to the entrance and were greeted by two members of staff - one who guided us through the x-ray machines, and the other who searched my bag. The fifth member of staff we encountered was at the turnstile, after a little wait, who scanned our paper tickets and allowed us into the park.Not one of these five members of staff mentioned that none of the rides were running. Instead, we had to find this out after walking around the park to a number of rides to be told by someone manning a temporary barrier that they were closed 'temporarily' due to an electrical failure. We traipsed around to three different rides to be told the same thing. I asked a member of staff to radio other rides to confirm that they were open. He was unable to do this as he didn't have a walkie-talkie. We then encountered another member of staff, who was helpful and polite, and who phoned through to other rides to confirm they were open. We then walked back to those rides only to be told by two members of staff, one of whom (name withheld) was particularly rude, that they were still closed. By this time, it was nearing 11:30AM - nearly an hour had passed since we'd entered and we were yet to actually be able to go on any roller coasters. As such, we decided that as Six Flags were simply not making good on their website's sales pitch, which states there are 'so many choices' and 'amazing things to do - [including] pulse-pounding roller coasters'.We decided we would make contact with Guest Services and ask for a refund on our entry and parking fees. We attended the Guest Relations office and spoke initially with Matt. Matt stated that the rides had experienced an electrical issue during testing (which it seems may not have been completed prior to opening) - but, as I pointed out, the electrics were working just fine on the cash register when I had to pay to park the car. I asked Matt why none of the 5 members of staff had mentioned the non-running of rides before we entered. He wasn't able to answer this. I also asked Matt why the staff don't have walkie-talkies to communicate with other staff. He stated that some members of staff are not trained in how to use them - which I find utterly absurd. I just hope there isn't an emergency in the park which requires all staff to be notified - with the size of the park and a lack of walkie-talkies, this could lead to a dangerous situation.Matt initially stated that all he could offer us to rectify our concerns was a fast-pass for two rides. Obviously this didn't actually mean that any of the rides would be running, and furthermore, the park wasn't busy. The fast-passes would be redundant on such a quiet day. As a bargaining tool, Matt offered us the option to return on another day in the next year. As I pointed out, the rides could also not be running on the day we return. And we were flying home to London the following day. We had specifically chosen the day we visited as a last-day in America treat. We turned that offer down. I asked to speak to a manager. Matt went and got Alex, who told me he was the highest-ranking member of staff there that day. Alex also was unable to provide a refund, citing a no-refund policy across Six Flags as a company. I politely explained to Alex that Six Flags had failed to fulfil the service they set out to do - to allow us to ride roller coasters - but he wouldn't budge. I then asked to speak to someone more senior. Alex maintained he was the highest member of staff present, but stated he would see if he could get someone, though it may take a while - we'd already wasted so much of day with no intention of carrying-on in the park, so we were quite prepared to wait. Bianka then appeared (I believe she may have just been in the next room) and was, frankly, rude. She placed her chin in her hand and leant on the desk to talk to me, which I found incredibly condescending. We continued our argument that Six Flags hadn't provided the service it had promised to do, but she also maintained that Six Flags do not provide refunds. We decided that we simply couldn't continue our day in the park, not knowing whether any of the rides would actually be running or not (especially since we'd been lied to), so we cut our losses and left - deciding that our time would be better spent elsewhere. We didn't want to have to give Six Flags any more money in food/drinks. Despite the 'no-refund' policy, Bianka did instigate the refund of our $25 parking charge, so that's something, at least.I don't doubt that other complaints were made about this day. It was shambolic and the poor customer service we experienced really let Six Flags down. This cost us a lot of money and we got no bang for our buck. We have been to many theme parks across the world, even the morally-questionable SeaWorld, and never experienced such poor customer relations.I have submitted a complaint regarding this issue to no avail.",katzim4
40,Not bad but expensive,I managed to get there early and tick off most the rides quite quickly which left me feeling a bit dizzy... park was clean but so many people disobeying the no smoking rules.Food is expensive and I don't even know why people can't take their own food so your pressured to buy theirs which is not affordable.Shops are expensive for itemsGo for the thrills and avoid the shops...,Ryan K

50,"Astonishing Memories, Thrilling Attractions and VERY Enjoyable.","When in southern California, this location is a must visit for all type of travelers and especially adrenaline junkies looking for a fun time. It is the best amusement park I have ever visited and definitely has the greatest roller coasters in all of California. In my personal opinion, the best attractions in the entire park include “Tatsu”, an incredible work of creativity in which you ride at a near 90 degree angle facing downwards as if you were a flying dragon; another amazing ride for the biggest of thrill seekers though is “Lex Luthor’s Drop of Doom” which is a free-fall ride that goes up 400 feet up in the air and drops you so fast that you make back down in approximately five seconds. Along with these adrenaline rushing rides, Six Flags includes plenty of other fun attractions that range from kid’s rides, musical performances, experiences with DC characters and delicious food, all of this at a very reasonable price when compared to all the other theme parks in Southern California. Finally, I’d like to add my personal advice to make your experience more pleasurable, the following tips are:1. Get there early, around an hour and a half before the park opens to get through parking easily and enjoy from the hours in which the park is at a calm.2. Visit the park if possible, during weekdays in vacation-free periods, for example, early May on a Tuesday.3. Lastly, go with a reasonable group of good friends or family to make the line wait go by faster.I hope you visit the park and have an unforgettable time because I would definitely go again in a heartbeat.",Diego_is_da_best
30,Park layout sucks and half the rides are closed,"The layout of this park is confusing and the maps don’t help. We downloaded the app, which I HIGHLY RECOMMEND, and that helped us get through the park.X2, Ninja, Viper, the Drop, Green Lantern and a few others were closed which sucked. The lines for food were insane, we didn’t even end up eating here because of this.",Aksension
10,Worst Six Flags Experience Yet,It took over 20 minutes just to get through the parking gate with only four cars in front of us. Most of the rides were broken down and not running. Long lines to get into the park. Wait times not accurate for any of the rides. People were smoking all over the park and no one was enforcing the smoking policy. Vending machine prices varied for the same product over the park. Prices were outrageous for everything. We went into one shop that literally had no registers open for purchasing something. This park has definitely gone down hill since my last visit years ago.,Tyler W
10,1st Time Season Pass Visit- Never Coming Back,"My family and I drove over 8 hours to have a family reunion at Six Flags- we used to go when we were kids and we’re looking to have a fun weekend together. It was also Fright Fest and we were pumped. We all had just purchased Season passes from a recent flash sale (some had Gold, one had Platinum, one was Elite).We arrived to the park at 1:30pm on October 13th to stay through the night into Fright Fest.We were told to wait in line with member services and once we got to the front after waiting about 25 min, they sent us to ticket will call.After waiting in the will call line, they told us to go back to member services.One of us ended up having to repurchase the entire Plantinim Membership because neither area had record of it.We showed them payment history, registration and everything.It took over an hour to get through member services/wil call.Then we decided to get a fast pass which was an additional $40pp +. That took another 1/2 hour.As new members, we didn’t know what was going on but found out that one of the membershipsCame with a single rider fast pass...(Confusing right?)We got BACK in line near the fast pass area (it wasn’t fast pass but right next to it) since the teenagers operating this place did not tell us our membership came with one fast pass which we double paid for.Needless to say, this was already a frustraiting situation and we just wanted a refund for one fast pass and to ride some roller coasters already.I spoke teenager named Shelly- blonde hair, brown eyes, about 5’2”. I calmly explained what happened and we were looking for direction and a refund for one fast pass. I explained we were first time members and wanted to speak to a manager after all the miscommunication. Shelly was defensive and unsympathetic. She waked towards the back office and we could see her asking for a manager. Her body language read like we were annoying her and I was astonished since WE COULD SEE HER.I could not believe how candid the whole inferaction had been.Shelly came back with a Supervisor named Alex. A 5’7, brown haired gentleman with glasses in his early 20s. When I explained again to him, he said we would need to pay more to upgrade if we all wanted our own premium fast pass. I asked how much, and he said he didn’t know. This Supervisor - Alex- didn’t even know what he was selling. I said, “that would be helpful information for us”.At this point, next to us there had been a couple of customers standing at the register next to us the whole time, getting assistance form an associate named Alondra, 4’ 1”, dark brown hair and brown eyes, and a gentleman named Dlyon who’s name tag read Manager, 5”8 brown eyes, dark brown hair and glasses as well. I don’t know what took so long to help the customers next to us, but Dylon and Alondra heard this entire exchange regarding my issue.It was at this point that Dylon- the Manager- having clearly overheard our conversation, stopped what he was doing and looked over and my family and I and laughed. He said “Damn, son!” And continued laughing as if my remark was some type of burn or joke. Alondra and Dylan laughed together, in front of me, in front the customers they were assisting.I could not believe how unprofessional and how candid these teenagers running this place were being with us. We are PAYING customers- SEASON PASS HOLDERS- who just paid $160 for fast passes, double paid for a Platinume member sho, and had to pay another $25 each ($100) for Frifht Fest, who also drove 8 hours to be there, waited in lines to get back in lines, had been jerked around by other departments that had no idea what was going on, and it was Fright Fest so we still had to wait in line to get our passes for that before we ever got on a single roller coaster.I looked at Dylon and said this is not funny, took a paper and wrote all their names down. Dylon and Alondra stopped laughing after that.Alex- the supervisor- came back with an instructions binder and explained to me an outrageous cost to upgrade memberships as he read it from a paper.Having written all their names down, Shelly & Alex also we’re suddenly helpful. They refunded us for one fast pass and we walked away.I do not leave negative, lengthy reviews, however this experience was unacceptable for any type of business and left a bad taste in our mouth.If you are considering purchasing a Season Pass or visiting this location, I strongly recommend you consider other things to do with your family. The prices are outrageous and the service does not warrant the cost.I will never ever be going back to Six Flags or any other location for that matter, and I will certainly not be recommending it to anyone I know.",tyneedancer33
50,Fright Fest at Six Flags is always a great time!,"We love Six Flags Magic Mountain and visit regularly. We had not been to Fright Fest for a few years so we thought it was bigger and better than years past. Excellent street performers, great rides and good service. We really enjoyed the Voodoo Nights Band. They played a great selection of songs with many current hits. We especially loved the new Crazanity ride and highly recommend it!",Wendy W
50,Great Weekend with the Teenagers,"We have the Diamond Season pass for Magic Mountain. We live near Phoenix, Arizona and try to drive over to Six Flags about once each quarter (4 times a year). We get the meal plan with our Diamond season pass. This gets you lunch, dinner, a snack, and a season drink cup. It’s a great value if you plan to be in the park more than 4 days a year. We really like the preferred parking pass you can get with the upgraded membership. You just have to reserve it online in advance of your visit to the park.This is a roller coaster park. They have some rides for the younger kids, but this place is for the adrenaline junkies that have outgrown the more mild rides of Disneyland. Some of the coasters are aggressive and can beat you up. Some of the smoother rides that still thrill are Full Throttle, Goliath, Twisted Colossus, Craz-anity, Superman, Justice League, and Tatsu. X-2 is great but I can only do it about once each day.It seems like Six Flags has been listening to our recommendations. They are now open 365 days a year. They have been upgrading some of their rides and recently added Craz-anity. They have been improving the way they have lines for some of their food vendors to be more user friendly. It even seems like their team members are more engaged and friendly.We were there for Fright Fest. It was a lot of fun and we loved how the ghosts and ghouls came out after 7pm. They had some great places to walk through to get a scare or at least be amused. The haunted houses were good. We walked through Hell Fest, Red’s Revenge, and Sewer’s Alley. We really liked Sewer’s Alley. You wear 3D glasses and it was a cool experience.This park is a great value for an amusement park. For the cost of a season pass with meals is about the same as a 3-4 day pass at Disneyland.",BienViaje68
50,Oh Dude or Dudete ... AWESOME Rides,"At one time this was the roller coaster capital of the world. It still have some AWESOME coasters!! I had a Six Flags pass for years living in Orlando FL, and I would travel out to work and hit the park on the weekend. They are the busiest on the weekend. During the winter months they are only open on the weekends. If you never been there and into coast -- put this on your Bucket List!!! Their Halloween Fright Fest is not the best. Atleast they do not charge additional admission charge like they do at Knott's Scary Farms or Universal's Horror Nights. Halloween is GREAT TIME of the year to have fun.",Dean A

20,Disappointing,"We found Magic Mountain to be disappointing. It took 1 1/2 hours to get through the entrance and the Flash Pass line and we had purchased the tickets on-line ahead. The roller coasters are amazing but the wait to get on them were 2-3 hours without the Flash Pass. We purchased a Flash Pass and if we hadn’t, we would have probably only have ridden a couple of rides because we spent the majority of time waiting in long lines for everything. We waited in line for 1 1/2 hours for food at 3:30 in the afternoon. There was an insufficient number of restrooms given the amount of people in the park and the lines were long there too. The customer service was very poor in comparison to other amusement parks we visited in the area. It was an expensive, disappointing experience.",Nicki P
50,Fun for all,Took a baby to the park took her on kid rides and was allowed to take her in line for adult rides and hand her to mom or mom would hand to me so we could ride big rides. Very accommodating and fun for all.,Robert F
10,Don’t waste you’re money or time!,"More than half of the children’s attractions were closed as well as about half of the adult attractions. The food court under super man took a 15 minute plus to get service when there was one person in front of me. Food and drink are more expensive than Disneyland! Everything is very poorly maintained with chipping paint and over all dust and filth. About 90% of the game attractions where closed, so we went to the arcade with A/C and that was a mistake. We waited over an hour for the “attendant” to show up and he never did. The nice EMS gentleman called them twice and told us to go to guest services. Going to guest services was an absolute joke! They treated us poorly and then told us if we wanted to walk all the way back they would give us tokens. We declined due to fussy kids and it already being a long day. We asked for a refund or even something small that was the same price only to be told “No”. We also mentioned how we literally got to do next to nothing because of all the closures of things that were not listed before buying tickets, and again guest services basically gave us the “don’t care treatment “ at this rate I won’t be surprised to see some type of lawsuits starting.",Rubi A

10,I suggest not buying membership,"! DO NOT BUY SIX FLAGS SEASON PASS ONLINE !I bought 5 of them almost 3 years ago.You have to continue for the full 12 months paying each month, and then it renews month to month with a minimum 2 week cancellation notice. I was okay with that.We went 2 or three times during the first year.After the first year, I went to the ""Membership Portal"" to cancel. It was difficult... you needed your original receipt and you needed to register accounts for each card (5 in my case) before you could cancel. So, I thought... it is only $36 per month... maybe we will go back soon.Fast forward to August of 2018 or almost $1000 later. I got serious about canceling. I stepped through a number of hoops and was told by the ""Membership Portal"" that I would get an email with the details I needed to submit my cancellation request. No email ever came.I thought.. ok we have not been back in a long time, but maybe we can go around the first of October and after a last day.. we will cancel in person.We did not get the chance to do that, so today I got serious.I submitted the request again... no email.I registered more accounts and suddenly, no cancellation option in my menu.I clicked chat with agent... ""No agents are available at this time.""I checked my bank statement and got the billing phone number and called it. I got a recording about park hours and if you have season pass questions, visit the website at....So I filed charge disputes with my bank and a complaint with the BBB of Los Angeles.I liked Six Flags before this, but now I will never visit again, and I am on a mission to help get the word out that you can get hooked. This is especially sad since people who mostly get burned by this are just looking to help their kids have a good time.Shame on you Six Flags.",Exploration486809

30,"Great rides, FILTHY park!","We have just returned from a day at Six Flags Magic Mountain. The first hurdle was understanding their horrific website to buy tickets. Each time you clicked on the link, the price changed. After several attempts that was sorted.Upon arrival at the park I was so excited as we were visiting from the UK. Queues to get in were small. First impression upon entering was WOW, THIS IS DATED. We used the restroom before going to the rides and OMG we nearly puked. The park had been open for 30 minutes and already the floors were flooded in urine and a drain was blocked. We used another rest room further and and the soap dispensers were smashed off and the sink areas rotten.It was a beautiful day but windy and clear blue skies. Due to this, 4 rides were closed because of wind. I get this and that's out of anyone's control, however, as the day went on, the wind completely went leaving a stunning day with high temperatures. STILL RIDES CLOSED. Staff blaming it on wind (even though there was none!)We did get on a number of rides and what we went on were amazing. The queue times stated though were totally wrong. 5 mins for superman was actually 35 mins. 30 mins for full throttle was 50 mins! The main issue was the queues hardly moved and the staff seemed so slow. The later the day got, the easier it was to get onto rides. The rides really were good, especially Twisted Collosus and full throttle.Buy your gifts well before you leave. I saw a hooded top at the store opposite full throttle and asked what time the store closed. I was told 6pm so decided to get my purchase before leaving. I returned at 525pm to find it closed and no other store had that item. You will also find most drinks outlets and other gift places closed throughout the far end of the park.We loved the rides but found six flags to be totally filthyThe restrooms and even the shops were dirty. We brought this up at guest relations and were offered free passes for next time. When We said we won't be coming back as live in the UK he continued to ask us to estimate a possible time for coming back... WE ARE NOT. We had no satisfactory resolution to the complaint and the customer service is pretty much zero. They've got your money so they are happy. Most people in there were complaining about one thing or another!Too many rides closed but the ones open were amazing. Go for the rides and don't expect glamour or a nice themed park to go round as it is not. It's DATED, DIRTY and needs a major face lift!",Simon T
30,Too Many Closed Rides for a Weekend,We drove from AZ to six flags magic mountain for a one day visit as I purchased season passes for my family and had to pick them up. We were there on a Saturday and they had many of the main Thrill ride attractions closed and not only was that a let down as we couldn't ride them but it also caused longer wait times on the thrill rides that were open making it harder to ride the rides we wanted. We were at the park for around 6 to 7 hours and only rode 7 rides due to this. I was extremely disappointed as I paid a good amount of money for my season passes as well as my nieces ticket for the day and we drove quite a distance to get there to not be able to ride the rides we wanted.,maegenr2015

30,A few tips,"Six Flags in many ways is my favorite amusement park. For locals, their season passes and meal plans are an unbeatable value. Try to buy over Labor Day when their sale guarantees prices are the lowest of the year. Other sales happen throughout the year, though, so if you miss that one, keep checking. There are MANY levels of membership passes so evaluate carefully based on your needs. For instance, for about the same price you can get a diamond pass with preferred parking, shopping discounts, photos and a skip the line pass OR you can get a basic pass with regular parking and a season flash pass that gives you half the wait time on mostly attractions. I have teens I drop off and they never buy anything. The second option was right for meThe park itself is clean and safe. The rides are thrilling, and if you come off season (not summer or holidays) the lines are reasonable. If you come during the busy season and can afford it, a flash pass will be well worth it, especially if you are an out of town visitor. Lots of people think of Magic Mountain as a place for older kids, but they have a very nice little kids area that is often empty.For out of town visitors my best tip is to buy valet parking. Regular parking is $30. Valet is $45 and we'll worth that extra $. Also, if you come with season pass holders, they can often buy your pass with a steep discount.So why only 3 stars/circles? Well, because everything is complicated. They will sell you a flash pass but never explain how to use it. When you show up, you find out you should have made a reservation. It's not a huge deal and in the end everything can be worked out, but many little things like that make this place pretty frustrating. One of my friends wanted her 2019 refillable drink cup, but instead she was given the 2018 .99 refill cup. Just a million little frustrations. Every year they fix one annoying thing but another crops up. Maybe someday it will all work out.",Theresa V

10,My first and last trip to Magic Mountain. Class action lawsuit will be pursued. This is Abuse,"Bought season passes for my girl friend and myself. Bought the dining card. Purchased the season pass becasue i ""Seemed"" like a good deal based on the price of a one time pass. When we showed up, my dining card was restricted to specific times which is not lisit on the website under the dining pass purchase area AND fright fest isn't ""free"" nowhere does it state anywhere near the fright fest purchase options that the mazes cost extra. This is misleading and, as used many times in the paragraph above, is nefarious. A type of consumer rape. When we asked for a refund.....well guess what....no refunds. We went to ""customer service"" only to notice a line of about 30 people all the same complaint. We will be pursing this matter as far as we can take it. we are looking towards a class action lawsuite. All we wanted was a fun night, and then a refund...but Magic Mountain refused us both.

Favorite was the Twisted Colollus(3 times) a traditional type coaster.If you go on the water rapid ride, you may get soaked depending where you sit.We didn't eat at the park (too busy rollercoasting), but drank plenty of water. The park is spacious, well set out and the added bonus of Halloween theme. We as a family of 4 with teenage kids throughly enjoyed the day, only one ride was closed and this was the only one we didn't go on. We'll recommended on a September midweek day.

My family pays the monthly dues to be Diamond Elite Members even though we live three hours away from the park. That being said my trip yesterday was full of disappointments right from the start. We wait in the longest line imaginable through the metal detectors with hundreds of people with giant bags of stuff when we had nothing except our phones in our hands, not sure why they can’t have a few lines just for people with no luggage to pass through. My adult son was then told he couldn’t take his vape with him into the park after being carded to make sure he was over 21 he’s 23, then told he has to take it back to the car. I saw no less than 40 people with vapes in the park after we got into park. We took it all the way to the car and once again into longest line ever for detection. Morning in park was ok but hotter than heck this day. We get into the super long special entry gate line what is the point of having a “premium” membership when so many people go into same line. We decided to get a flash pass since lines were so long and even paying 80 per person with our discount there were only a few we could use with flash pass and three were a one time ride only. The que’s were long even in flash pass line. The employees are extremely rude in this park it is definitely not Disney! When the Fright Fest festivities began it was even worse we got express wrist bands for maze and the lines were barely shorter than the non express lines.I think the park is just trying to make what they can and aren’t concerned with customer service or wait times of guests, even when u pay extra to try to avoid the long wait times. It seemed the quality of the festival has declined as well. Less monsters and more money for everything. Not sure why they can’t sell a limited amount of the maze express passes and allow us to pick what rides we want on our flash passes. Very disappointed and will be canceling my membership as soon as i can since we signed a contract. We spent over a thousand dollars and had a barely enjoyable time.",shannonsB9899YE
50,Empty so great,"We went midweek from the uk we decided to drive to here rather than Universal,, the park was void of schoolchildren which was fantastic as all the rides were so accessible maybe 5min wait for each,,, went on every one,,, tops X2 then superman ,, great place when empty",richard g
10,Friend unable to get on rollercoasters,"For their birthday we went to have a great day. It turned out to be miserable. My friend was too big to get on the rides (The whole purpose of the 1.5 hour drive to the park). Since we were not allowed on the rides we came for, we went to Customer Services. We were not allowed to be refunded by the park since we could not do anything we had come for. We were treated abusively. We will never go back!",Adventure421815
10,"Great rides - Dirty Park, unhelpful staff & slow wait times","Me and my Husband have been really excited to visit Six Flags Magic Mountain.Upon arrival, the queue to the carpark was long because there is no designated line for people who have already paid for their parking and have a bar code.Upon entering the park, again, the queues in were long as people were faffing with tickets and the whole thing felt very clunky getting in.Finally, in - we bought a soda (20 minute queue) then went to the restroom, again, queue.We went on our first ride, X2. The wait time said 15 minutes outside. Once in the queue and looking at the app, this was actually 45 minutes.We then went to go refill our sodas. At this point, my head is in my hands wondering what the hell six flags are doing?! Why the hell are you selling a refill option when you have to queue 20-30 minutes each time you want to refill it? Why are there not designated refill stations so people queuing for food don’t have to wait excessively for people filling their drinks? The whole thing is clunky and is madness!We then queued for Tatsu.. which then after 40 minutes of queuing... broke down.We then realised that Apocalypse, Green Lantern & Viper are also closed today too?!We came at the weekend fully expecting queues but for it to be almost 18:00 and only completing 3 rides is insane.I’ve been to a lot of theme parks, but never known one as clunky and lacking pace like this one. There even seems to be a low amount of coasters of the tracks so the queue times COULD be faster but the decision has clearly been made not to use them.To add to my frustration, we have then realised that we need to buy additional tickets for the evening maze?! WHAT THE HELL SIX FLAGS.You charge us for entrance tickets, extortionate parking, LOCKERS?!, refill drinks you can’t bare to queue to refil and now EVENING MAZE TICKETS?Mind blown. This entire park feels like an entire money making operation.We left after being at the park for 12 hours only completing 8 rides.Extremely dissatisfied and disappointed in six flags for such a low standards.",Charlotte
40,Place is amazing,The place is always hotter than anywhere else. It’s like they heat their concrete!! On the flip side it’s the best place to go for a great fun filled day of the best of the best rollercoasters,JOhhnyutah
40,For dedicated Thrill seekers only!,"Though this park may have a few family attractions, most of the rides here are thrill rides. Wouldn't recommend this park for youngsters or elders. Walks between different attractions are long and sometimes uphill which could be exhausting. Days here can be intense. The best way to experience this park is from opening to closing on a day thats not to hot or crowded. This park also isn't very beautiful. Full of ads and lots of the areas could be upgraded. I even noticed that some areas of the park smelled bad. But if you like thrill rides, this is the place for you. The roller coasters are outstanding... and they have a heck ton of them! We rode a lot of them and our favourites were Twisted Colossus which has high intensity drops, hills and twists. Tatsu which tilts you into flying position. And X2 to (NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART) which is very scary and disorienting. It's not the most comfortable roller coaster but it's a MUST RIDE at Magic Mountain. We also enjoyed the Superman, the Lex Luther Drop of doom, and Full Throttle. It is a very fun place, I can't lie. But the food is overpriced and not great so pack your own lunch. Oh, and avoid the Viper roller coaster because it's awfully painful!",Joshy B
10,HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE,You guys shipped my phone back to me which I'm thankful for except for the fact that you guys didn't even package it in a safe package and I received it shattered and in pieces not only did I waiedt 5 days for it but it won't even turn on it is completely destroyed and I'm having a hard time even getting a new one. I have to pay all this money for a new one and I can't even get a hold of a representative this is so unprofessional,Samiah R
40,"Great overall, but call and ask about private events","I have been to this Six Flags location 3 times now. The experience has been great, every time I actually got into the park. On a Friday in August, I drove the 1.5 hrs to this location and they were closed for a private event. I am signed up to the newsletter, have the app, etc. and there was no mention of the park being closed that day. I even went through all of the emails to double-check after it happened and there was nothing. So I would recommend calling to check before the drive. It was not a holiday and there was no reason for me to believe the park would be closed. Otherwise, nothing but positive things to say about Six Flags Magic Mountain.",Amani B
40,Rollercoaster Thrills,"Spent the day for the thrill rides. Lines were short for a Sunday in September and did not need to spend the money on the flash pass. Temp was over 36 degrees Celsius and the heat was a little overwhelming with the rides. X2, Tatsu and Collosus are the best!!",Shane L
40,The rides make up for all this park's shortfalls!,"We travelled over from the UK to LA to hit up all the theme parks and Six Flags was top of our to do list. We knew it's reputation for big rides and as ride lovers we couldn't wait to see if it lived up to the hype.Short answer...It definitely did!The rides were epic, even the coasters which didn't have much of a 'scare' factor were far more intense than their UK counterparts- or any other coasters in other parks such as Disney or Universal.We went once the schools were back and queues were non existent, we didn't have to wait more than 2 carriage rides to get on any of the rides.The only thing I would say is, if you are going to the park for anything other than to ride the rides, you'll be massively disappointed. The park is no where near as clean or aesthetically pleasing as Universal or Disney. The toilets are pretty gross and the food was disgusting! The staff weren't great either.Some tips for first timers:-It's a bit of a con that they tell you need to put your bags in a locker for rides (At $1 a locker on each ride) when you actually don't, you can leave them on the side of the loading docks. The only exception to this was on X2 where you do need a locker.- The map they give you of the park (we found) was really hard to read- especially when it came to finding the entrance to the Superman ride. I would say ask the staff but they're few and far between so maybe check it out online first to see if you can get a better idea of the layout.- If it's a hot day plan ahead, when we were there (off peak) most of the drink stalls were shut which made getting a drink a bit of a mission and when it's 35+ degrees you don't want to be walking further than necessary to find a drink.- If you go off peak don't be conned into getting the front of the line pass, it isn't needed.- We love rides and have never been physically affected by them in anyway but X2 really shook us about, it was the first ride we'd ever got off and gone hmm we need a break before doing it again.- Don't take your phone on the rides unless you have zipped pockets. 2 people lost their phones on one ride on Full Throttle, one on the first loop and one on the way back over it at the end. Funny to watch when it's not your phone but not so fun if it's yours!",Christina
50,Perfect day,"Went on a weekday right after school started. Park was empty. Currently going through a lot of construction, but will be worth it in the end.Lots of great rollercoasters. Buy a locker for a day. Worth it. Only $8.",TTzz
40,Just ok,I love six flags but was disappointed this time. Just under half the rides were either closed or breaking down during my last visit. They are getting ready gor the Halloween which looks pretty cool. Hope I get a chance to get there for it cause I know the Xmas rocks,CarolKozak08
50,Great place with not very big lines!!!,We had a great family day out at this park & pretty much went on all the rides with very little queuing time. We went on a Tuesday & it wasn’t very busy. Obviously the great roller coasters are the main attraction here & there are a great variety. I also thought the food choices were pretty reasonable for a theme park also. Loved it here! Would go again in a heartbeat,gmac73
50,HUGE Park - Lot's to do,"We visited the park on 9/7/18 and had a wonderful time. Got to the park early, zero lines, walked on to most coasters. Attendance was light for a Friday. There is PLENTY to do for everyone. Park was really clean and the staff was friendly. Nicole at the parking lot was great! Recommend visiting if you visit the LA area.",Patrick M
50,The good place to have fun,I think that it was the better experience that i had. The place is very confortable and adequate for any entertainment,helamantovarus
50,Rollercoaster paradise,"Went Sunday, September 2nd 2018. Went to ride the roller coasters had a fantastic time. Was quite busy I guess because of the holiday weekend but was still worth it. We bought season passes they will be back over and over again. If you love roller coasters this is the place.",D4625EHeds
50,Really fun,We visited on two separate days with our adult sons and we had a ball. We rode all the roller coasters together and boy are they scary and high. We came back to do the water park with them and thoroughly enjoyed that too although we were a little disappointed that they shut all the rides down at 6pm I think it was. So I would go there a little earlier next time. Great rides at both parks.,erica6634
40,This park is definitely for the adrenaline junkie,"A great experience while visiting with my wife (who will go on some coasters) and my two teenage boys who will have a go on anything.Range of coasters is amazing though we knew that before we booked to come here, highlights for me were Tatsu and Twisted Colossus, also X2 is an experience that has to be done (wow).The park itself however is in need of a good tidy up, there are areas that are worn out and even dirty looking which does not inspire confidence if the upkeep of the coasters if it cant be kept clean.The loading of the coasters is painstaking when compared to other Parks that I have visited in and out of the USA. I think it has a lot to do with the lapbelt requirement and the ease of the attendants to check it before the primary restraints are placed down by them personally. This prevented us 'dueling' on Twisted Colossus on the 7 times that we rode it over 4 different days despite the ride controllers orders to be quicker if the cars were to race. :-(Having said that I did enjoy it and would return again if I get to opportunity to visit California again.",Richard H
40,Family fun day,"It’s amazing , full on rollercoaster junkie day no queues straight on every ride . The X2 is something else , it’s classed has a 5th dimensional roller coaster that has you starting off backwards facing up ( like manta at sea world but opposite way round ) however the seats rotate 360 degrees as you start moving and turning at 76 miles an hour you dont know where you are . Tatsu is another good one and Ridley’s revenge is also however you kind of stand up on it (really weird) . Superman is fast it goes 100mph backwards . The park itself is a bit tired and needs a good clean it’s definitely more for adults however they have opened a children’s section , there’s lots or work going on with a few new areas planned for 2019 , a few of the rides where also closed for maintenance bit of a bummer .All in all a great family fun day and we’ll wo the money.",Phill M
50,Some of the best rides EVER but read caveat,"Okay, so we’ll get the disappointing parts out of the way first.1) Gate entry manned by jobworths! We had a Go-Pro with yellow float on it. We were banned from taking the float part in which weighs about 30g and couldn’t hurt a fly. I could however take my rucksack in which is Oakley Hardcore and could do serious damage if intended. There’s huge billboards on the way from the car park saying what you can and can’t take in: even down to selfie sticks: really???2) The itself is large, and “hilly” if that makes sense. There’s just about sufficient shade when walking in some areas but in others shade is completely absent.3) Nowhere near enough misting fans: the operators should pop over to Universal in Orlando.So be warned: take a hat/ cap/ bandana and sunscreen. But we didn’t go there to microexamine the place, we went to ride.We’re pretty hardcore riders and like everything that induces adrenaline: the rides at Six Flags do that in abundance.We had watched them on YouTube before leaving and they far exceeded expectations.X2, Superman, Crazanity, Full Throttle, Tatsu etc all BRILLIANT.Queues were managed well: the park wasn’t overly busy ( 17 August), food was typical theme park fare and turkey legs were good. Avoid the stodgy Chinese gloop that’s been sat for hours.3 rides were shut on the day we visited but it didn’t spoil anything.Book online as it’s much cheaper.In summary;Staff: 6/10Park grounds: 5/10 ( dated in places and shows).Rides: 10/10Would we go back? Yes.Ps: if you’re any good at football your guaranteed to win a top prize on the “soccer darts”",speedbird350
50,Time for an adrenaline Rush today.,It was a group of 7 of us at the park. we all have season passes. We all had a Great time. We ate ate the bar grill and the service was excellent.,stevenjgalindo
40,Fun day at Sixflags,"Took my 17 y/o daughter and 13 y/o son to Sixflags on 08/23If you are looking for thrill rides, this is the park for you!The lines were mostly below 15 minutesWith the exception of X2 which opened late and had over 45 minutes wait.The rides are great and provide safe feeling.Restrooms were OK and there Is water fountain near each of themFood is just OK, with bad service, high price as expected.You need at least one full day, even off season.",ALAL789
40,Fun Amusement Park,"We have a Six Flags annual pass for the one in NJ and decided to visit Six Flags Magic Mountain while I’m the Los Angeles area. It’s an older park that could some updates (eg., there’s chipped paint on the railings, the parking lot could use repaving, etc.), but the rides were great fun. My 13 year old had a great time on all the roller coasters and was sad to leave. It’s abour a half hour from Universal Studios to Magic Mountain, and a good way to break up our trip.",RKD0000
30,Magic Mountain Not What I Expected,We were there a couple of days but park seemed kind of boring. Roller Coasters/Rides were great but the atmosphere itself was not. I've had more fun at Fiesta TEXAS in San Antonio.,lizmirjac
50,Best thrill rides compared to any other - but long lines,This is by far the best theme park for thrill rides. As an avid roller coaster fan we visit theme parks everywhere we go. Went with young and old teens and everyone enjoyed it just the same. Definitely not for young kids and not for the faint hearted. Food is basic theme park food and facilities are basic. Lines are long in summer so if you can afford the flash pass it is worth it to be able to cover the rides in a day. Some days the park closes at 6 so check timings per day. Also car park is far from the entrance so use the bus. Not so obvious when you get there!,supermojomom
20,Should have went to Knotts Berry Farm,"Should have went to Knott's Berry Farm instead of Six Flags Magic MountainI waffled over going to Knott's Berry Farm and Magic Mountain. Most I spoke with said my kids would be happier at MM. Kinda sad we did, esp since MM Closed at 6pm everyday and passes were the same price plus all the issues below.Rides Closed The entire time.ApocalypseGREEN LANTERN: First FlightViperTidal WaveAll restaurants and stores in the Apocalypse area (Cyclone Bay) accept one small gift shop next to Dive DevilDrink locations understaffed. My kids went on Tatsu and I was in line for drinks for almost the entire time. There were more people staffing the ride photo locations (at least the ones that were open). Also many of the freestyle coke machines (like in Studio 4f) were empty of many types of drinks/syrup (day 4 this was better). This was the case at many of these locations.Restaurants: I understand the need to give students and foreign workers a chance to work, but you don't put them on the cash register taking orders when they don't have the understanding and speaking ability to do it. The person in front of me asked for salt and the counter person got the deer in the head lights look and had to call someone else over. I had a similar issue when I redeemed my purple bottle vouchers. Even the worker who ended up getting called over was having trouble getting her to understand what was needed. That being said, the restaurants had good staffing levels so we did not wait long for our food. And the food was tasty. Price was as expected.Bathroom cleanliness varied greatly. The ones near the front of the park were clean and well maintained, but the ones in DC area near the Green Lantern & Flash rides were out of toilet paper, water running constantly in sinks, toilets that did not flush, and just overall smelly.There were no shows in either theater and the Full Throttle Nights wasn't showing either. Everyone I spoke with talked about setting up for Fright Nights. I get it takes planning, but its August!!! Also I only saw a few characters out walking or posing for pictures over the entire 3 days we spent in MM. We also spent 1 day at HHHurricane Harbor. An entire corner of the park was closed including Tornado, Tiki Falls, Part of Black Summit Slides and Bamboo Racer. Kids were not happy about Tornado being closed. The other ""family"" raft ride does not compare. The wave pool is advertised as ""king-sized waves"" but they weren't today. We've been here before and the waves were much lacking compared to then. However we did enjoy the benefit of cartoons and music while waiting for the ripples. We were looking forward to eating the Hawaiian BBQ but were told when we checked into our cabana that they aren't open on weekdays along with some others. On a positive note, the young lady taking care of the changing room/bathroom near the lockers was doing a wonderful job. I told her so, but cannot remember her name.",forthebrats
50,Unlimited coasters,"This theme park is the place for adrenaline pumping.It offers unlimited high speed roller coasters. The place is for adults before kids.I recommend upgrading to the flash pass ticket.And don’t forget to bring bottles of water with you and some snacks, because the prices in the park are exaggerated.",Abdulah1996
20,"As usual for ""mountain parks"" funny, but overestimated","Funny if you feel passion for roller coasters. Of course you will enjoy the park. But honestly the price that I paid does not correspond with the level of attractions and services.The best in my opinion was Goliath. In summer, Do not forget your swimsuit, because is quite hot and you will enjoy with certain water rollers. Sun cream is more than recomendable.Food & Beverages are very expensive inside and you can not introduce any outside food or drink. Controls and radars are very strict on this.Sometimes, especially in the afternoon, queues are very hard. We expend more than an hour in certain attractions with severe sun and hot. staff was not proactive to reduce it or go fuster. It seem just the opposite, more relax and therefore you lose the emotion attraction by attraction.The closing is very early. 5pm in summer does not make any sense, considering the high price.Certain attractions are closed and nobody tell us any explanations or price reduction. At the end we are paying for all, but receiving the portion that they want. Not fair.In general bad experience. Save your money and long drive to this park. It is not worth it. No intention of returning.",Jose g
50,FUN FUN FUN,"We went to Magic Mountain to ride the extreme coasters and it did not disappoint. Great value for the money, if you are looking for fast scary coasters. I would recomend the fast pass also. It really helps plan the day, we were able to ride 15 rides in less than 8 hours time. And eat lunch :) ALSO, The deal that feeds 4 at the Twisted Wich restaurant was a very good deal for the money. 4 large sandwiches 4 chips and 4 drinks.",cjherrera39
50,Great day,"Brilliant rides, loved colossus please keep open, wasn’t working when arrived. Superman the best. Got platinum pass which was great but overpriced.",clancy65
40,Roller Coaster Dreams,"I recently went to Magic Mountain with my friend from Canada and her 15-year-old son for our one ""attractions"" day while they were visiting So Cal. We decided that an amusement park was more in line with the kind of fun a teenager was looking for other than a theme park.Over-all it was a great day!! We went on a Thursday and I believe a lot of kids have started school by then so we had decent line times, anywhere from 10 mins-30mins. One thing I think Magic Mountain could improve would be adding fans in the line areas as there are none and when it's hot out you sweat like crazy! They have provided shade but that shade sometimes diminishes the breeze and a nice breeze, even if generated by fans goes a long way!I love roller-coasters and so does Olly (15-year-old) his mom, not so much, so for her the day was more about taking pictures of us when we loaded up on a coaster. She had fun because she was able to stand in line with us and would either cross over the ride to wait on the other side or stand just outside the exit.My favorite ride was between X2 and Full Throttle - AHHH-MAZING!!!! We went to X2 for our last ride of the day and happened upon an additional 30 min delay cuz the 'train' was getting stuck. While they were doing the maintenance closing time came and went, but they still got through the line and we all had our final ride - which was WELL worth the wait!Drop of Doom - Wholly crap - is it ever freaking high!!! For me, it was easily the most terrifying and I was crapping my pants at the top in fear. (kind of the point of thrill seeking rides!) I would totally recommend...unless you are afraid of heights. The speed of other rides kind of takes away from how high up you are and it feels like you never really notice...well...that is NOT the case with Drop of Doom!!! AT ALL!!!! I am so happy I went on it but it was the most frightened I have been on a ride, basically, ever.Check out if there are deals online before you go. There is $20 off if you buy your ticket at least 24 hours before you go, which we neglected to notice until the day of buying tickets, however, found the same $20 savings by bringing a coke can. You can bring an empty can and still get the deal. If your can is full you can't bring it into the park. You CAN bring in one unopened water bottle per person and we re-filled with water fountain water, but it is not filtered, and you notice in the taste.We had a great day! The staff was friendly and all seemed to like their jobs. They gave us good advice as far as if we needed to get the fast pass based on how many people were in the park and as a guest I really appreciated that. I think had they try to sell us on the pass I would have been set off the entire day, but because of their honesty, we had a very enjoyable experience and were aware the longest lines were going to be about 30 mins.Just know, it's gonna be hot while you are waiting in line so bring something to fan yourself.",Raegan K
30,Getting better,They are trying to cater to the younger children now which is nice. More kids rides. Miss the log ride though. Staff seems pretty helpful and nice. Can get very crowded with long lines though.,J6063CWjamess
50,SO MUCH FUNN,"thrill rides, new rides, great family rides, dining pass is so beneficial, i'm so thankful for such a great experience.",Vanessa M
20,Pretty disappointing,"We went to Six Flags expecting to be shaken off our skeletons with the wildest rides we'd ever ridden but it really wasn't the case. We went on about 7 of the rides that were supposed to be the ""maximum fun"" and yes they were fun but they weren't...exciting. We didn't feel that adrenaline rushing though our bodies or that dizziness after it stops or our hearts beating out of our chests.The best rides are definitely towards the end of the park, to your right as soon as you walk in. The best one was called Twisted Collosum or something like that. That was the only one that really made me feel like I was in a rollercoaster ride.Everyhting else...pretty boring to be completely honest",Salma
40,Very nice rides and a lot of them,"If you want at amusement park with thrilling roller coasters Six Flags Magic Mountain is the place to go. We came early and could in the morning go directly to the most attractive one (superman, X2 and Goliath) the park is clean and plenty of parking.Improvement points:The park is NOISY, many rides are very noisy, the level is comparable to a jet fighter starter (superman) which during a whole day is annoying. We were there a very hot day and did miss cool water fountains to fill our bottles, I do acknowledge that the park wants us to buy expensive water but it should be possible to get cool water. In Universal studios they have installed fans with water misters to cool people, these was also not at hand, so in all a fun but noisy day.",JanMC2013
50,A step Up,"To be clear, this is a rollercoaster park and not a theme park. I did not enjoy it, my wife did not enjoy it but my son loved it. If you are a rollercoaster junkie then this is for you. We have done the Florida theme parks but the rollercoasters here are a level up. You will either love it or hate it. We had planned 9 rides and a ""route"" beforehand. 1 ride was closed so we did one other. We arrived at the front of the queue and had all of the rides done by 13:30. longest wait was 30mins. Wait times in the afternoon can be long. We went on a Monday in July. So go early and avoid weekends.",Northern_traveller56
50,Best rollercoaster park in the worlr,"Loved all the rollercoasters although Viper, Ninja and Apocalypse should get replaced with new rollercoasters. These rollercoasters are rollercoasters you'll never forget and you'll talk about it with friends like omg I went in there and such stuff. Just because I loved it so much there I'll give it 5 stars. The food and toilets can be improved though.",Gino H
40,20 odd rollercoasters. only 4 I would choose to do again!,"My son is a rollercoaster fanatic, he had anticipated this place for years, whilst planning our trip to the USA, this was the park he wanted to do more than once, so it worked out cheaper to get a season pass, even for only visiting twice. However I wasn't overly impressed, I found the toilet facilities dirty, the cafes extremely hot no air con anywhere, we found one with fans in it Generally felt the park was tired and needed updating. four of the rides were not working and one kept breaking down - twice when at the front of the queue. as a Park I found four rides we loved which included superman, twisted C and Goliath. ( excuse spelling !) twisted C however was out of order on the second day for most of the day, you could only use it once on your fast pass too. I would probably not return to this park if visiting California again, but would def go to Knotts Berry farm again, as although less coasters, all were good.",oldhogs
40,Its all about the big rides,"This park is all about rides, big rides and it has several very good ones. Superman, x2, twisted colossus, full throttle and crazanity are some of the best around. Thats not to say the other coasters are not upto scratch they are all very good.The park is no disney, its not pretty or the cleanest we have ever been to. Some of the restrooms were a disgrace. Very little shade in many of the areas. Well worth getting a drink package and getting a flash pass got us on every ride which i am not sure we could of done in a day.",joep735
10,Waste of money and little shade.,"Family reunion in California, several places were great, this was NOT! We decided to pay for the Fast Pass, it is not fast. We were there for 5 hours and only got on 5 rides. We paid well over $300 for two people and it was such a waste. And these parks are smart, provide next to no shade so people will buy their drinks. There are water fountains almost everywhere but water was warm and tasted dirty. If you do go, spare your children and leave them at home/hotel - they will be more miserable then you in such a short amount of time.",Cheshire84
10,Don't waste your money,"My family and I went to Magic Mountain a week ago and this place is a dump. Workers were rude, the grounds were dirty and since we went on a day not considered a weekend, they only had one car working for some rides. As one worker of a ride stated ""they do this so they won't have to bring in more people to work on days that are slow."" Half the rides were not working at all. We were pitched to buy the speed pass so we could get on the rides faster. What they tend to forget was we spent almost 400.00 on tickets just to enter the park. Won't be spending my hard working money on this park ever again and for those who are going on vacation and want to go here, reconsider your options it's not worth the money you pay at all.",abraso432
50,Adrenaline Rush Central,I love roller coasters but even I was blown away with the adrenaline rush that came from riding the rides at this park. I appreciate the ride operators holding the lines back so that people didn’t have to wait in the sun. I loved my experience. You must try Full Throttle and Twisted Collusus,Antoine B
40,Day To Remember,"We purchased the platinum passes and we are so glad we did. We had a chance to ride every single ride in the park and some rides we rode multiple times. We walked straight up to the very front of the line every time. Well worth the money. The only downfall is that you can only ride the really good rides once like X2, Twisted Colosus, Full Throttle, and just a couple other good ones.",Bianca E
40,Great day hangng out with Family.,"It was a nice day, not too holt ot too cold. Most rides did not take too long to ride but some of corse are more popular than others. We as a family just need to come up with a game plan so we do not walk around the park in circles all day..lol..",rosemaryf903
30,So not impressed at all,We queued for over an hour only for our rollercoaster to be shut down just as we got to the gate with no 'fast pass' offer or any sorry but why don't you try....the staff didn't seem even remotely interested in being customer friendly and some did everything not to have to talk to anyone just shuffled around. The toilets were disgusting and the place needed repair. While we were there three rollercoasters where shut down for service. Over all the place needs a lot of repair. I would not be overly confident of the safety of the place if they can't get the basics right. The food was over priced and disgusting. Over all disappointed and only got to go on about 5 coasters all day.,Helen258
30,"Many roller coasters, but that's about it.","While I had my complete fill of roller coasters here, I was disappointed in the customer service. It's an unclean park without much in guest amenities. The ""fast"" pass is not worth the money earlier in the week as we didn't have much in the way of lines.",171wbryan
50,"Rollercoaster world, expect long lines","I grew up going to six flags. Then I stopped going for a bit and just went again. This is the spot to go if you like roller coasters. Everyone in our group was tall enough to go on everything. There were 60 to 100 min lines to some of the more popular rides so we didn't go on all of them but it was still a lot of fun. We have always started our route by just going to the left, but I think one day we will try a different route. Riddlers revenge, viper, scream, goliath, and the justice league ride all had under 5 min lines. The justice league one is fun, interactive and indoors. It was my first time on it. Rides are not as smooth as i remember but my younger cousins didnt seem to have a problem with that. I wad kind of bummed not as many rides had pictures anymore. The roaring rapids (water ride) had an hour wait but it was worth it for a sunny day. There is a phone app so you can see wait times, but it wasnt always accurate. My cousin already had the purple water bottles from a previous visit so we got drinks for free all day. We had lunch there but decided on cheaper dinner at the fast food restaurants outside. If you purchase your tickets online you can see all the different options. Membership might be worth it for you. They include parking and parking is $25. You also get 20% off for souvenirs and food. If you like roller coasters, go to six flags.",Andrea G
20,Disappointing on many fronts,"The rides are excellent - no question. But there are many, too many, things, which overshadow the visit.The place is dirty - surfaces are sticky, in the restaurants the tables and chairs are sticky, even the handrails in some places, the restrooms simply appaling.When we came, and that was not too late, no electric wheelchairs, were available. The first manual wheelchair had a spin to the left, the second one had basically no brakes, so worn down were the tires. A normal wheelchair is pretty useless, as the pavement is old, uneven and full of cracks. And, of course, the place goes up and down and has a nice mountain in the center. My husband could use it as rollator, but otherwise it was useless.For the flashpass we had to wait for an hour in the line, only one person was handing out flashpasses.For the carting we had to pay in addition - not clear why. At the tidal wave we could not sit in the first row because of our flaspasses, also not clear why.All in all it was a mediocre experience because of all these problems.",Ekaterina S
10,Disaster,Came here to have fun with our special needs kid. Purchased Platinum Flashpass for party of five to avoid lines. Then had to wait more than 1 hour to get the flash pass!!!!! How sick is this?,WOLFGANG S
50,WOW,"Having been disappointed by Disney and looking for some more thrills for our teenage kids (and ourselves) we paid the not insignificant amount for tickets & Flash Pass for Six Flags.What can I say except wow!! Lots of high octane rides. We were fairly lucky and the park was fairly empty so we managed to get about 15 rides in during our time there. Check out X2, Tensu and Twisted Colossus.The only negative is the price and quality of the food on offer. It's all fast food (and low quality at that) and expensive for what you get. Apart from that the rides are excellent.",Andrew C
50,Still have a grin on my face,"Came to visit with my 8 year old son for a day of action. I was a bit hesitant about bringing him to such high action place, but it was his request to ride some rollers. Unbelievable fun. High adrenaline rides. We purchased the platinum Flash pass, and it was worth every penny. We hardly waited more than 4 minutes in lines, and most we go to go on immediately. Be careful with X2 if you have any form of back or neck issues. It’s violent. Must be at least 54” to ride the big boy rides, otherwise 48” is ok. Great fun. Also, purchase the valet parking, and you’ll pull right up to the front.",KeyLimePie
10,Would not return,"We were to visit disney land and were told not to miss a trip to magic mountain so, with our limited time, we decided to visit magic mountain instead due to its location and cost. There are buses running from the car park to the front of the park (we prepaid parking online at $25USD). Park tickets are cheaper to purchase online in advance so we did this. We were waiting in the line with no shade as there were no signs for prepaid ticket holders to proceed, I thought I was going to pass out but there are some water rides so it’s ok. You can’t take your own drinks into the park so be prepared to be stung a lot for beverages throughout the day. We tried the viper first, the wait was not long and at the end of the ride I complained my neck hurt, my husband thought I just could not hack the ride, had it not been for the two people behind us complaining of the same thing he would have continued to think so. It resembled to a traumatic car crash. That might be some people’s cup of tea but for me it was too far. After looking at our options I noted this was one of the most thrilling rides, as was another I was looking forward to going on; crazanity...we made a long walk over to this ride. We waited 45 minutes in line, chatting to other park goers and watching the ride and the it looked great, I was very excited. We got up in the air swang back and forth a few times and came back down. My husband said “that’s not right, that can’t be it”. They announced there were some maintenance issues and they did not know when the ride would be available again, left us roasting in the sun for a while then finally let us off and said we would need to line up from the end of the line should we want to ride again. The lady behind us said the Drop of doom also got stuck at the top of the tower in the red zone and they and other riders had to climb down using the ladder in the tower? I understand maintenance is paramount but it all sounded very risky. we left the park after that. Bit of a waste of a day on our trip. Wish we went to disney land",KristenAzz
30,Beware of hot days and long wait times,"I have been here several times, some of which where awesome and others not. Public service announcement: in the summer this place easily gets over 100 degrees by noon, with little shade. Combine this with adrenaline and being tossed around by coasters and someone could get seriously hurt. Heat stroke is no joke and I have witnessed it several times at this park. The walk from the parking lot to the park is long and in the sun and on a blacktop. The security line to get in is mob, taking easily over an hour, even on less crowded days. Beware of the heat. I feel this should be stated more throughout the park.My other concern is safety. 16 year old kids operate these rides. Rides have broken down with people stuck on them, in the sun in 100 degree heat. I don’t understand how there isn’t a contingency plan when this happens. This is straight up dangerous and actually stopped me from going on any rides the day I visited. It was too hot anyway so I wasted a day ticket but oh well, I went for family. Be prepared to wait 2+ hours on weekends and holidays for each ride.Ride closures. Happen All. The. Time. It’s really annoying given this park is in LA and people travel internationally to go to it. They don’t advertise which are closed in advanced, not even at the gate. At least not consistently. Their website is a lie, so be prepared to be surprised about something going wrong when you arrive.The rides here are amazing, no doubt about it. Thrill seekers galore. But I feel safety is lacking and going on 100+ degree days can be dangerous. I will probably not go back again.",littleve
50,MAYBE THE BEST THEME PARK IN THE WEST,They are constantly updating this park and also ties to Hurricane Harbor. Both parks are phenomenal and highly recommend them.,mlarrabure
10,"Well, looks like I have to review this poor excuse of a park once again","I already had a bad taste in my mouth from the previous experience (check my previous review), but figure I'd take my kids to Hurricane Harbor last week.It's the same security, not sure if this is the Trip Advisor page for Hurricane Harbor, but since there was an issue with security again, then I figured I'd leave it here again.So what in the world is the deal with your security? They are on their high horses about all of the wrong stuff! They literally sniffed my vape, to smell for marijuana I'm guessing. I was with my kids!!!! 11 and 14. And here some security guard is sniffing my vape pen, while my 14 year old son has this look of like ""what do you have in your vape dad?"" Not only did he sniff it, but he harassed me about the extra battery I brought and demanded I show him the cartridge that attached to it. I explained to him it was just an extra battery to the vape he already sniffed in case that battery died. Then he called his supervisor over and she proceeded to sniff my vape. W-T-F Are you kidding me???So we get passed security. After 10 mins of pen sniffing and bag searching and enter Hurricane Harbor. Sweet!So we get to the first line The Tornado. And it doesn't seem long. After 45mins I'm like ""ok time to get fast passes"".So we get fast passes and schedule the tornado. Everything goes smooth. Next we schedule black tube snakes and head to the wave pool to wait for the timer on our watch to run down. Timer runs down we head to what we think is the line and are informed that we were at the wrong line. The slides are connected, the same color, and look identical. The line we wanted is on the otherside of the park.So the fast passes are great if you know where everything is in the park. They should tell you to download their park map pdf online before coming to the park. Because guess what? There isn't a single park map anywhere. They have one in guest relations that has no key on it, which makes it useless.We arrived at 10:30 and by 2 pm we finally had a system of scheduling the next slide and then asking a staff member the location of the slide immediately.Talk about a stressful arrival to a water park. I've never had so much trouble entering and accessing a water park, EVER.Then the staff, I get their kids on summer break, but they have no customer service skills. NONE. I think you need to quit hiring kids and get a real staff. These kids don't care. I spent $46 dollars on lunch for myself and 2 kids. It was a cheese burger and 2 double cheese burgers and kettle chips. The kettle chips were so soggy they were ""flappy"". When have you seen a kettle chip flap?!! So I ask the staff working the booth by the wave pool if they have any different kettle chips (prior to me noticing the big nasty bin of kettle chips that was nearing the end but you can tell had just been drenched in grease from the chips draining to the bottom. Yuck! I tell the girl this is gross, you guys gotta get better going on here. She looks confused and just responds ""Ok, well have a great day"". By this time I'm asking the lord for patience, and I'm not even religious. So I just walk away.2 strikes on this horribly ran company. Won't be a 3rd.",Eric P
20,Good rollercoaster but very dirty,"Went on 22 July. Whilst the park had good roller coasters and was a decent day out , for $85 each + $25 to park I would've expected it to be cleaner and not as tired looking compared to Disney and Universal. Car park was all cracked , had pot holes , sidewalks grey and paint fading , stairs to rides very dirty and walls of rides had chewing gum stuck all over them. I felt it needs a lick of fresh paint everywhere , more cleaning staff, car park fixed and cheaper drinks. Nearly $40 between 2 for drinks for the day is a disgrace . Ticked it off the list but won't be back .",j w
30,Last stop before home,"Maybe it's because we went there on a Saturday but was it ever so crowded. This was our first time there. It was family trip last stop before heading home. We arrived there about 10:30 am and the parking was a headache. There was no shuttle that was running so it was like a 15-20 minute walk. We have season pass so that was the only good thing, didn't have to wait to purchase tickets. There was no place to sit, at all. We looked all over. We ended up sitting on the big rocks (if it was flat on top) that was used for landscaping. Everywhere we went was packed. The lazy river was so packed you had to literally run otherwise you were run over by rude people, either horsing around, or those in tubes. Speaking of tubes, people carried them all over, most just runs you over or smack you in the head (remember where we were sitting). I think the tubes should be used specifically for the particular ride and put back. It was like being in Disneyland if it was a water park. Maybe I might give it a higher rating next time if I get there when it's not as crowded. It wasn't relaxing or enjoyable.On the other hand, the rides side was less crowded. It was like 80% of the people there were at hurricane harbor. My only complaint is that when a ride is closed, the should put a notice at the entrance (a lot of the rides were in sections) instead of letting you walk all the way there to find out (some had a worker there others just had a chain at the entrance to the ride). 3-4 rides were closed. Unless I didn’t see them, there was no specific place just to get my free refill had to wait longer than expected. My wife said that the all the women’s bathrooms were filthy. Only because we purchased season passes (we might swing by nexttime. It was my first time there since moving to California over 10 years. We’ve been to the one in vellejo California and the on in San Jose, I thought this one looked older and less up-kept.",fwjthoj
50,Best Six flags I’ve been so far,"I’m a bit of Adrenaline junkie, also a true Traveller so I take Pleasure in hitting up as much Theme Parks as possible, while on my Global quest of Travel. I’ve been to most of the big name Theme Parks in London England and The states. I really enjoyed my time in Six Flags Mountain as it Caters for everyone of all ages. And packed with fun things throughout, I Preferred this park to the Six Flags in Georgia Atlanta. Even though it’s a Mission to get there but well worth it. I Definitely Prefer the setup of the park",Lloyd M
40,Thrill rides galore but very little shade and drinks very expensive,"If you are a coaster fanatic this is just amazing. So many fantastic rides to choose from. Stuff for all the family too. But the extreme rides are great.No queue for some cracking coasters like scream, x2 although the walk to get to the rides could be significant.If you are not the most mobile the park could prove tricky as it's very hilly although there is a short express train which will take you to highest point.It wasn't busy today and no queue longer than 45 mins although surprisingly for a park of this stature surprisingly not many single rider lanes for big attractions which could have cut waiting times on the more popular rides. I had thought about flash passes but really not needed today. Wish I had another day to explore because it really wasn't enough time to fully explore.One niggle was lack of shade, very little space to cool down, could use some cooling water fans in most areas of the park. Which brings me on to my next point. Water was just under $5 a bottle. And the heat and lack of shade meant we spent about $60 on water for 3 of us as we didn't want to only drink soda. The refillable cups are a better bet if you are a soda fan but in this heat we prefer water.Family rides which were great were ninja flash and justice leagueWould defo go back and recommend for coaster fans. Especially as universal Hollywood does not have any real thrill rides like it's Orlando site",mwilliams15
50,Adventure,For me the best theme park i have ever been to. My top three attractions were tatsu goliath and x2. Best adrenaline experience.,SpalekP
50,One of the best themeparks ive been to,After getting the rollercoaster bug back in 2017 I decided to take a trip to america to visti the biggest and best amusement parks. Six Flags MM was the first one i went to and It was the most epic day ever. fantastic rides and a whole lot of fun.,Michael H
40,Fun place,Magic Mountain is fun for the whole family. Lot's of variety in entertainment. Different eateries to choose from,Meredith J
40,Great time Fun Rides,Our family vacation was to California this year. My son loves roller coasters. His birthday gift was trip to six flags magic mountain. We all enjoyed all the rides and we were there from open to close.I suggest coupons for admission to save money. Plus food and drinks are over priced. Eat before you go then get your hand stamp for re-entrance to go to eat off the park.,cga8s
50,Biggest roller coaster in the World!,If you're into roller coasters this is the place! Great day out and plenty to do - as long as you're onto roller coasters!,Dave
50,Excellent and Challanging rides,This was my first visit to LA in a theme park. My teen son recommended me Six flags as his high school friends had visited. I was more scared about the rush as it was week of 4th July. Luckily we six flag was not crowded and we had a great time. Some of the rides were scary and we all survived. If you have kids above 10yrs / 42 inches and they want to try something exciting then its work visit. You can not try all rides if kids are below 42 inches. There is ample parking available and bus is available from parking to main gate.,NavinPuri
40,Busy,Omg I have never stood in so many lines in my life. First a line to catch a shuttle from the carpark. Then a line for bag check. Then a line for tickets then so May lines inside.I suggest spending the money and getting a express pass. We were there 8 hours and hit on 4 rides. The rides are amazing though,Nikilh
50,Good time,My wife and I booked to visit after talking about it for years. We accidentally booked during school break and were worried it was going to be chaos with massive lines. We were pleasantly surprised that no rides took more than 5 minutes to queue for. We ended up only staying for a few hours as we went on every ride we wanted to get on. Food was extremely expensive which I suppose was to be expected.,James F
20,Not very organised at all,"We queued for bag check and when we got to the front of the line read what they allow in. No food at all, so had to throw it all away!! Then queued for the very expensive fast passes. A lady at entrance called Ruby didn't seem to know alot and tried sending us the wrong way twice... an hour later we were able to begin the day.Valet parking on the return to the car was also disorganised and had to wait quite a while. The rides were not all open but the ones that were we did enjoy.",India f
50,Best theme park for adults,"Loved this place. Lots of high rides, queues weren't long at all, not too many small kids - quite adult orientated, which is nice when you're are grown up. Shuttle efficient, toilets not great though. Overall, the best theme park we've been to, and that's a lot!",Katemape
50,Was Good,I was really excited to visit Six Flags Magic Mountain if you would like to see my video blog you can just check out my YouTube page *LDuran Productions* and you would get to see how I spent my day at Six Flags Magic Mountain to be honest it didn't seem as organized with staff as I have experience with other parks one ride was closed the wait times were off but overall I had an enjoyable experience and I would be back,Puredove11
40,Coasters galore,"Had never been here before but glad we visited. They have so many rides that my family couldn’t get them all in.We didn’t splurge for the fast pass, so lines on some rides were long. The park was overall pretty clean but the some of the bathrooms were not.Some of the coasters bang you around a bit but that’s part of the allure I suppose.Be prepared to drop some money if you eat here, everything cost twice of what you would think it should be.If you can afford getting the fast pass, do it. Saves a lot of time.Went on the Fourth of July and saw a really great fireworks display. Really spectacular and glad we stayed to see it.",MikeMc33
50,Best day of their lives!!!!,"We were fortunate enough to come to Six Flags Magic Mountain on a day where there were not huge lines. I brought a group who had not experienced Magic Mountain since they were kids, if at all. They all left saying that it was the best day of their lives. Great service. The staff on the rides made everyone feel secure and safe. The rides were super scary and thrilling. The rides were well maintained. The park was clean and the performance at the Werks Theatre was amazing. All the bathrooms were immaculate except one.",Gabrielle M
50,Patriotic Fun,"Welcome to the scream capital of the coaster world. This place is awesome! My family had a blast. Anytime we come to California, we always make sure to stop here at Six flags Magic Mnt. This park has everything to make your heart skip a beat. It has mild coasters for the younger kids, and the not so brave adults. But if your an adrenaline junkie like me, then you'll have the time of your life here!I do want to point out, if you want to save a couple of bucks on visiting the park. Check with hotel your staying at, many local hotels offer discounts on 1 day passes to the park. Up to 40% on daily ticket prices. If your not staying at the hotel, check out the discounts that Coke offers. And make sure to sign up for there Magic Mnt's newsletter. Because they offer some discounts and special offers to the park. Like, get in an hour early or stay an hour late after the park closes. So there are many little perks to look out for just FYI.But the park has many different kinds rides. But its known for it world class record of rollercoasters. And they keep adding to it, usually every year. This year was the new Crazanity ride. Unfortunately, it wasn't quite yet done, when we visited. It was stated to open on July, 13, 2018. It bills itself as the worlds largest Pentium swing. And its a monster, when you see the size of it in person. So it should be a great ride.But if your experiencing heat exhaustion, you can cool down on 3 different water rides that'll soak you down. The best 1 is roaring Rapids, this ride is a lot of fun. And its great ride for the entire family.The only complaints that I do have with this park, is the price of food & the bathroom cleanliness. The food was extremely expensive, it was $10.99 for a hot dog. And an extra 2 bucks for a bigger hot dog. My eyes 👀 about popped out from the prices. 💸💸 Some sandwiches were $15 each! We did like most families on a budget, we ordered 1 thing and shared it. Same with the drinks, we got the unlimited refills and shared that as well. Parking is $25 for a vehicle, and it good 1 day. No in & out privileges. And more for valet parking.The bathrooms needed some attention as well. We spoted a giant cockroach running around at entrance bathrooms. Several of the bathrooms were pretty dated, and seen better days. And some bathrooms had water spilling all over the floor. From what, is a mystery still. But you'd see puddles, pooled up on the floor.Besides those 2 things, the park employees do a good job. Of keeping it clean throughout the park. I personally love this place, I get my crazy on while I'm here. This a thrill seekers paradise!",Clorissa P
30,Great Rides; Horrible Bathrooms,"This is the fifth six flags park my wife and I have been to and it was definitely our favorite. Great collection of roller coasters! If we return to souther California we would certainly go back. But six flags management, If you’re reading this please....please clean your bathrooms more frequently. I had to ‘go’ and went to four bathrooms in the park before I gave up and simply left the park to use a bathroom. They were THAT disgusting. Overall, I loved the park, but the bathroom conditions left a black mark on our day.",APope21197
30,Bathrooms are consistently GROSS,"Okay, so I love roller coasters - I mean really love them. The coasters here are fun, the lines can stink, but go off hours or weekdays and its fine. THe problem is the cleanliness of this place. Please PLEASE clean the park. There is trash, the bathrooms are gross to the point of holding your shirt over your face and food on the ground. Invest in some really great cleaning people and get back your stars!!!",sportspup
20,Overrated,"We had some high expectations while visiting California and despite my preference for visiting knots berry farm we visited here instead. We got in line for the first ride and waited two hours. After that it was right after right that would close down or not be running. The park was rather small in my opinion compared to other Cedar Fair properties. Food costs were outrageous. Even tried to add the waterpark for the afternoon and they wanted $39 to go visit for two hours before they closed. I asked the customer service lady if she would pay that price and she gave a pretty dead pan face of silence.Employees at the roller coasters Were orherwise goofing off and tricking people and otherwise lacked a lot of professionalism that would have me concerned about a major accident occurring. Especially the full throttle ride attendants. At Cedar Fair properties there are employees at the beginning of the line to help answer questions check for height requirements and update line times, but not on any of the rides at this park.I don’t think I would ever return to this park again.",Brad B
40,Crazy Rides!!! Crazy Experience - Highly Recommended,"Absoutley love this place! Some of the craziest rides and jaw dropping moments. Recommend - all the rollercoasters here. Flash pass would make a lot of difference. Try going on a monday or tuesday to avoid crazy crowds. No Food allowed, so be careful and carry minimum bags, they dont allow them on the ride and make it compulsory to hire a locker",TravelWithDee
50,Great time!,"We took our two granddaughters and had a wonderful time, some of the rides are pretty scary but they loved every one of them!",linjaybran
20,Lines lines lines unless you buy fast pass,Here from uk and what a difference....2 hours on and still queuing for only the 2nd ride of the day...30min wait pfft we have been in queue for a hour and still can't see the front....no point coming if you don't get the fast pass tickets as you won't get to go on most of the rides,Martin P
30,Don't visit on a hot day,Rides are fantastic - however their queue lines are not equipped to deal with hot weather and we found ourselves getting very frustrated queuing in the sun or shaded areas with no cooling sprays or fans.. overall the park is very grubby and looks tired.,Ajinuk
40,Get battered about at high speed - and love it,"First time here. Access to the park is very good and lines were fast moving - the place was busy but the short bus ride from the end of the parking lot was a tiny wait and fast to get to the front door. Had no kids so was able to ride ""the big ones""--->Goliath, Colossus, Scream (this one makes your belly squirm), Batman and finished up with Tatsu - this one is awesome: Almost the biggest and fastest ""flying"" ride you can ride - best part is the massively long inverted loop - holy heck. In between these rides the food courts were okay, there was an indoor 30 minute theater show with balancing acts,dueling trampolinists, all fast changing setups...this is actually excellent fun and gives you chance to cool down from the sun. I recommend it half way though your day at the park. We paced ourselves and stayed about 7 hours which is ample for this park, which is not massive. Things typically not liked i) Refillable soda cups for $17 dollars (good grief), Pre paid picture voucher which could not be used on most of the rides we went on.(unfair). Recommend taking a cooler for your car (used before and after the park in my case). You can also leave the park and return if you want to -we did not do that. On the whole it's a pretty compact park with a range of great rides (a few were closed).",Andy M
20,Poor service,First time a magic mountain six flags great very very happy but this restaurant don’t have good workers Alex the cook was rude and mean 😡 this not a great worker if he is not happy working here he can go out to find and other job this is a Restaurant no a jail,Emmy V
30,Decent place,"The park is in need of. Renovation, the staff was mostly rude. The parks don’t have that many rides compared to other six flags. The parking area is really far from the entrance and they only had one bus back and forward so it took for ever to get in and out unless you was willing to walk to the parking lot which most people did.",Karina M
20,30% of thrill rides closed on day of our visit!,"Magic Miuntain lists 20 thrill rides on their website. On the day we visited, the website said four of them were either not open yet (1) or temporarily closed (3). Then, while trying to visit Collosus and Revolution, we were told they were temporarily closed also. Those closures were not listed on the website. Six rides closed out of 20 - that’s 30%, which I think is more than a reasonable amount. There may have been other temporary closures too of which we weren’t aware since we didn’t make it around to all the thrill rides.",Cole R
40,Hold on tight to your wallet!,"The rides are fantastic! We had a hard time deciding which were our favorites. We bought the 4 Gold Memberships early in the season, as it was close to the same price of buying day passes. If you plan on visiting more than once, you will make up the difference when you use the free parking perk (normally $25!). You need to do your homework, though, because the employees are poorly trained, and not sure what discounts apply to your pass. When you explain it to them, they are confused, and have to consult their supervisor, who will also be confused. It is time consuming, and required patience on our part. I'm sure as the season progresses, they will get the hang of it, right? We returned to visit Hurricane Harbor recently. I expected to pay more for a locker than we do at our local water park (50 cents). I was thinking maybe $3-5? Nope $15 (card only) for the smallest locker! Free drinks? Yes, when you purchase the special refillable $18 drink bottle. We are grateful we packed lunch in the cooler, as food prices are roller coaster high! Be there early to get a decent parking spot. Overall, we really did have a great time.",Judy L
50,AMAZING! GO VISIT TODAY!!!,"My overall experience was amazing. I went with my cousins 2 times in one trip. One was at night time, and we only had about an hour or so before the park closed at nine o clock, and the second time was the next day, when we spent about 6 hours at the park. It was my first time going back to the park for many, many years, but my cousins are so close, that they knew it very well. They showed me and my brother around, and introduced us to all of the fantastic looking rides that were just waiting for us to ride! I was very nervous at the time, because I was the kind of person who was just scared of roller coasters. My cousins kind of forced me onto some rides, and I have to say that that definitally helped me overcome my fear. I went on so many roller coasters that maybe a year before, or even a month before, would never, ever go on. I went on Riddler's Revenge, Scream, Tatsu, Viper, Ninja, Gold Rusher, buccaneer, and some more that I kinda forget. Im so proud of myself for going on these types of rides finally, and totally incourage you to go on these rides as well, especially if you are nervous to. Magic Mountain is a great park to allow you to break out of your shell of roller coaster fears, and I loved the overall experience so, so much. I guess you could say that I'm kinda obbsessed now. I have been looking forward to making plans to go to fright fest in octoer with my cousins as well, but time will tel. Anyways, I really reccomend Magic Mountain for everyone, and not to mention the kitty land side-Its pretty cool! Especially for littler kids that like roller coasters, but not very big ones. They have mini little roller coasters that are actually pretty fun, and I see little ones wanting to ride them several times in a row, while at the same time getting a little nervous before going on! Which of course, is totally okay. I mean hey, I got a little nervous before going on Gold Rusher! {Which was the first ride that we went on the first time I had been there in several years;I still was scared of roller coasters so we all decided to start off easy, and small:)} Overall, I LOVE magic mountain, and is yearning to go back again and again! LOVE IT!!!",taeganj123
20,The Diamond is Rough,"We've been to Disneyland and Disneyworld so many times already and my kids are now teenagers/ adults.. so I thought, it's about time they move on to the more adult rides. That's how I ended signing up with the Diamond membership with Six Flags Magic Mtn. I thought there would be a lot of perks, but before you do anything, STOP! You'll REGRET IT! LIKE I DID. And there's 6 of us, so you can imagine.Why?#1- Parking- we did forget to sign up before 5am to get the preferred Diamond parking, so I tried to call in in the morning so I could inform them. But no, they wouldn't do anything for you anymore. So much for getting a preferred member. They will treat you like anyone else. If you end up paying towards the end of the lot, the bus won't even drop by closer to that lot, you would have to walk FAR. As in FAR! no consideration at all! They will pick you up and drop you off like in a parking lot far away.. which is really strange. They can just gave their buses drive closer to those parking lots but no! OMG!#2- ride lines.. you will only get 1,, ONE! Free FAST lane pass... so after that experience with how long you have wait to get on a one minute ride.. so NOT worth it!#3-supersize Me.. if you want yourself fat.. imagine. Unlimited soda drinks! Lol. Don't mind water.. it should've been unlimited water bottles!#4- getting our membership card.. the guy who have it to us was nice. But his supervisor was so bad. She was telling him not to issue cards in front of us.. because it's holding up a line. What the heck. She should be helping so there won't be a line. OMG! And the Park was smelling like weed..as in marijuana pot. OMG! Customer service man!#5- toilets.. They need to maintain is cleanliness.. it's nasty!Those 5 are the key! And I bought the meal passes thinking it's worth it to have over there. Common sense..if we are going to get charged every month.. we would expect to be fed all day! Anywhere, anytime! But OMG! You only get fed 1 lunch, 1 snack and 1 dinner and Dinner is up to 730pm andto think the Park is open until 9pm. What the heck! We couldn't even use our dinner since the time we got out of our rides, it was 715pm. What a total waste!I really complained asks all I got was we can't do anything about it! Well, I can't do anything about it but give them a crappy review as well.So I'm telling you.. don't ever ever succumb to their membership scam which locks you to 12 months of hell! Totally NOT WORTH IT!UNLESS you live within the area and have the time to visit the Park every month..then yes.. that's worth it. If not.. don't!Total fail!",cynch72
30,Good fun for family - not for the faint of heart!,"Treated to a fun afternoon at Six Flags I was determined to face my fear - of helghts and speed! With much encouragement from family and friends I went on four (4) rides. What can I say - I’m a wimp when it comes to being spun upside down many feet above the ground at speeds I can’t comprehend!! I admit it, I screamed all the way, clamped my eyes shut and prayed for it all to end...quickly.My gracious friends were sympathetic, but urged me to try more rides as it “gets better”. After trying one more (no screaming this time, just sheer panic) I was convinced this is not for me. I couldn’t understand how everyone else was having such fun, totally exhilaration and what not.So while the venue was nice and and the wait in line wasn’t too long (we chatted), I can’t see myself going back in any hurry. And if I do, look for me probably on the kiddie rides!Sorry guys, just not my ‘speed’!",Colleen WB
40,"Rides-thrilling, atmosphere-blah","It had been a couple of years since I had visited. I've gone to Magic Mnt probably over 30 times in my lifetime. I wanted to ride twisted colossus and I was not disappointed! It was exhilarating! If you could only ride one ride, this is the ride I would choose. My big boys enjoyed the other rides while I took my little one to the kiddie rides which he loved. Some cons- food is expensive. We're AP members for the D theme park and if you compare it, it's probably slightly more which I think is high. Also, the atmosphere in the park is blah. At the entrance it's good but once you get to the back, there's nothing going on. As we were getting on DC Battle for Metropolis, we noticed that there was nothing to see, park looked kinda dead in that area( BTW, loved the aforementioned ride). If you like thrill rides, it's great but if you're not then you might be bored.",weluvtrvln
30,Six Flags needs some Magic-,"Hoped to give five stars, but as someone who actually believes in magic, this place gave me a headache. Great staff gave me hope- all nice why I give a star. The park is dirty- overpriced- unhealthy. Construction, w/fumes, while park is open is UNSAFE for children! No water fans 90+heat, painful. Be prepared.",polishedblack
30,Disappointed,"We were expecting a Universal like experience, but so disappointed. Surly staff, long queues, queue jumping and brutal rides. Thrills ....yes, but felt raw!",toffee290
40,It’s a five for the riders a three for everybody else,"The riders in my family loved Magic Mountain and raved about the coasters X2, Full Throttle, Twisted Colossus and the thrill rides Superman and Lex Luther. The non riders got a good workout as this really is a mountain. One of our party sprained his ankle and I was impressed by the attention of the first aid crew. We got a wheelchair escort out at end of day. Some of the reviews cited unfriendly staff and dirty restrooms but we found the opposite to be the case. On a weekday in June the park was not too crowded and the flash pass guaranteed rapid access to attractions.You have to be prepared for heat in the summer. If it’s 70 in LA it’s 90 at Magic Mountain. The one thing that is pretty bad is the food and food prices. $10 for a slice of pretty average cheese pizza. We found some healthy choices at Food Etc. but the options were limited and we paid $14 for a Greek salad. Finally if you’re not a rider find something to like hiking around or playing Pokémon Go. Not much there for you.",George Y
30,Fun park,"Really fun park especially if you enjoy thrill rides. We got there for opening time and managed to get on quite a few of the main rides with hardly any lines. However, by the afternoon it was pretty busy with a lot of rides having 50+ minute waits. The only frustrating thing was the organisation of the park isn't great, while waiting in line for a lot of rides we could see that some of the rollercoasters weren't being filled up and had several empty seats and the Lex Luther ride at one point only had 3 people on when the line was at least 30mins long!!! It just would make sense to fill up the rides?? Then the battle for metropolis ride was a different story where me and my partner were told we had to sit separately as he needed to fill up the single seats! Well surely this is the whole point of the single riders line?? So that kind of ruined the experience as the whole point of the ride is to play against each other and we obviously couldn't.Apart from this it is a really fun park with some of the best rollercoasters just a shame they couldn't get some tips from Disney in regard to their staff and organisation.",Beth W
30,Mid week visit,"I go yearly to SFMM thanks to my kids earning free tickets for their reading efforts. Noon Entrance after the opening rush made for no gate waiting. Of my 4 kids, 3 are brave and tall enough to ride to big scary coasters. One is too young to go on all of them. So after all the kids enjoyed Ninja my husband took the youngest to Bugs Bunny World and the older went with me on other coasters. Lines are reasonable and not too long midweek. There is an effort to keep lines in the shade and away from the construction dust happening behind/around SFMM. My only disappointment was at Food Etc found “Under” the Superman track. I used to work at SFMM in my college days and the Food Etc was my favorite cheap “eats” place to have a break because the air conditioning is outstanding. Still is!!!! But every available table was filthy or strewn with trash and unappealing to have my weary kids sit at. We finally settled at an empty dirty table and cleaned it ourselves. After paying a whopping $13 for 2 large sodas (Booooo!) the kids felt refreshed enough to move on out the gate to enjoy an actual meal outside of the park. $25 for parking sucked too. Seriously?!? We were there under 4 hours. Not worth the short visit.",Ike E
30,DOT,"Always a fun visit to Magic Mountain, but the kids enjoy Hurricane Harbor even more. We have 6 family memberships. But when there's a problem there is not anyone to help. You must visit the park for help or even a question about the membership. When you call you referred to visit online even if you can't log on. If you try the option to speak to someone they never answer. I thought a found an email but still never got a response.Great place to visit, horrible customer service.",David T
40,Unbeatable rides — arrive early,"The best Six Flags park out there — at least 15 major roller coasters and several water rides and other attractions. They open fairly late, so be there right when you do and you can hit several of the best rides in the first hour or two (assuming you can take that many that fast!) without any real waiting. They don’t charge nearly as much, so they don’t staff nearly as well, as a Disney park. Many of the rides grow to have ridiculous waits by late in the day that could be drastically improved if they worked on the loading and unloading process (Roaring Rapids is a notable example.)All in all, we had a great day and you will too.",TopofTXtraveler
50,Love coming every year!!,Love the roller coasters ! Get a season pass for max savings! Great price! Good food. Great at accommodating disabled people.,roseomarch76
50,Great investment if you do annual pass!,"We got an annual pass and it was a great investment. It includes parking and the water park. We haven’t tried the water park yet. But Magic Mountain makes it easy. It has a kids place where your kids can run around and you can watch them and it is not overwhelming. Also, our kids love scary rides and so, that is key if you want to come here. The lines can be long, but the good thing is that with a pass you can go anytime and try to plan around busy days.It is not Disneyland, so you have to have that expectation. It is a fun amusement park, but the experience is what you make of it with access to great rides.",sassygirl4ever
30,Pretty sure my son is tramatized - solid parenting on my part.,"Took my 12 year old to the park thinking he would love the thrill and excitement. He loves the ""scary"" rides at Disney so I thought I would step it up a notch.I was wrong.The food was expensive, like any standard park. The place is kind of dirty and 4 of the big attraction rides were not working. The staff was slow, and rude. The coffee was awful (you'd think they would support parents and AT LEAST have good coffee), and the merch was basic.Also, there were nearly a dozen school buses even during the summer. So be prepared for rude, unsupervised teenagers acting like fools.if roller coasters are your thing.. than do it. Otherwise, skip it all together!",Heather L
40,Hot,"This park is small but it has a lot of things to do , but it was hot and humid it was 114 inside the park but 95 outside the park very very hot. But a lot of fun.",Mrsyogibear
10,It's to bad a negative rating is not possible.,"I will never WASTE my money here again. Skipping the extremely long lines that can easily be fixed. The ""customer service"" through out the whole park is so lacking that you really can not call it service. The line at guest relations is longer than the rides and was there all day. The lack of knowledge, hospitality, organization, respect, friendliness, manners... you get the point... is beyond disappointing. For the price you pay to park and enter then add on the over priced food and drinks (because you can not bring in your own) you should not be treated like are bothering the staff with your mere presence.",MichelleB369369
50,Best roller coaster rides,"If you are looking for an adrenaline rush, this is the place to go! The park is not the cleanest compared to other amusement parks in CA but the rides make up for it!! I would definitely return and bring my family back. This is one of our family’s top five amusement parks that we have visited. I’m so glad we came here.",agonzalez915
20,SPIES I TELL YOU!!!!!!,"The staff here do not have great personalities,get easily ticked off,spy and stare at you, and only cares for themselves. I do not recommend this park if you wish for good service. The rides are fun overall but they tend to break down often.",Ivan l
30,Too hot,"My day started off with a super long walk from the bus drop off to the gate, and then at least 20mins queuing to get through the security check. So I finally got in the gate around 11.30am (tour from Anaheim).The wait for rides was short and I probably didn’t need to spend the additional $75 on the express pass.There are loads of extreme rides; some so extreme that they actually hurt to ride because you get thrown around too much (eg. X2).There is very little shade and AC in the park. In the afternoon I did find a food place next to Goliath where I got some respite from the extreme heat; it was a bit dirty though.The food is very average and quite expensive, far below Disney standards.They do give free cups of water though which is good.I highly recommend Superman, Lex Luther and Riddlers Revenge. Tatsu was quite good. Ninja was very average.It’s an ok park with some good rides, but I’m not sure that I’d bother coming back again.",sarahu1981
40,An awesome way to spend the day with friends!,"This had to be one of my favorite field trips! We went to Six Flags for Junior High grad night and it was just awesome. My best friends and I had so much fun it was unreal. Since we went on almost all the rides(including X2, Full Throttle, & Goliath), I can give a general review on most them. All the attractions were unique and different. Of course, they were all fun in their own ways. The good thing was that you never got bored of riding them. Also, I can say that after riding them, I did not feel sore at all! The riding experience was smooth, which imo is very important. The only ride which was a bit rough was X2. This ride is rated the scariest, which was true. I recommend going on it first since the line could get very long. Now, I know based on this review I should rate it 5/5. However, I feel it would be more fair to rate it only 4 stars. This is because one of my classmates' restraints went up in the middle of a loop(belt remained buckled but the restraining guard went up) during the ride Viper. This is very scary since as you guys know there have been many accidents at six flags that have resulted in injury and even death.. I didn't go on Viper, and those who did didn't experience this. However, even if I had the time of my life, safety first. Before riding make sure your restraints/buckles are secure. Also do not, I repeat DO NOT put anything in your pockets no matter what. A classmate put his phone in his pocket thinking it would be ok, but it fell out. I always did these before riding and I was fine. Besides this, my own experience was wonderful. (P.S. This isn't required, but I think it would be wise to buy a flash pass before going. The prices range from like 35-135 dollars for blue, gold, and platinum passes. My friends and I got gold and it was a smart choice. While other classmates only went on 4 rides, we went on 14.)",Unknown U
30,Tourists: dollars will fledge your pocket on this ride!,"Went to this park, because it was included on the Go City Card, but on arrival you are slapped in the face with a $25 parking fee, for which you get: very remote parking and a stinky bus that doesn't even drive that often. And guess what? Their website now is offering: Buy 2+ season passes and get free parking all year long. Thank you locals, I paid fot that! Food and beverage also are exorbitant, like $6 for a bottle of soda or water.On the positive side: if you visit late in the day on a weekday, wait times are very short, some rides you can board almost instantly.",Bert V
40,Great coasters! Need a couple of days to visit all of them,"Quite a few things to say. First of all, I recommend to be there at least for 2 days if you really want to go on every coaster. I spent 3 days in there myself. For that reason I fully recommend the membership. Also, parking can be crazy expensive (25 per day), and now some if not all memberships include parking as well.The good part about the park is that they have many different coasters, wooden, hybrid, launched, flying, inverse, standing-up, 4th-dimension.....quite diverse if you ask me. I am going to review all of them in the following lines.1. Goliath: Great coaster. Drop is intense, high speed, loved it. Went in there twice, and would have gone on more times if I had more time.2. Twisted Colossus: One of my favorite coasters ever. Hybrid coaster, if you are lucky and get on it while synchronized to the other train, it is even better. You go on both blue and green track on a single ride, really fun drop, inversions are insane. Do not get on with glasses unless you have a strap, saw someone lose them. A little bit bumpy at the back side, but given that there are no restraints near your head your head does not suffer, so no headaches or anything like that from it. If you see a long line don't worry! one of the fastest moving lines in the park.3. Viper: Vibration on this one was a problem for me, fun, but not the best coaster. I would still go on this one in the future, but no more than once.4. Superman: Great coaster! Try to get on the front at least once. If line is outside the entrance, come back later, unless they are running both cars at same time (only one when I went). Went on this one 3 times. My advice: get sunglasses with athletic straps, I did get on with regular sunglasses on this one though, but just to be safe. Speed is intense, so could not keep my eyes properly open otherwise (believe me, you want to enjoy view if you are thrill-seeker).5. Tatsu: this flying coaster is my favorite. First time it was quite intense for me, I wasn't ready for it, it did not help that I had the beginning of a headache. Next couple of times felt amazing! The loop were you pretty much fly backwards is insane, the drop in this flying coaster is crazy too. Advice: if you have long hair, get your hair, tie your hair up our you won't be able to enjoy the view that much. Also, try to get on it when they are loading 2 trains at a time.6. X2: This is the most intense coaster in Magic Mountain. G force really intense most of the time. My problem was near the end, in which the seat jerked so fast and so hard that my head leaned forward and then immediately after, it went backwards, so I hit my head quite hard. This resulted in an immediate headache. If I had tried it again knowing that, maybe I would have tried to figure out a way to keep my head from leaning forward on that part, to be honest I am not sure if I can do so. Also happened to my brother, sitting next to me. My advice, at least ride it once, and see if it's for you. Work to keep your posture (in this case it requires quite a bit of strength given the intensity of ride). I would leave this one at the end of the day, in case you end up with headache.7. Apocalypse: Old-fashioned small wooden coaster. Jerky, as expected of most wooden coasters. One time thing for me.8. Riddler's revenge: In this one you go standing up. First time I experience one. I have to say, not a fan of that posture. Vibration gave me a headache, besides that, go on it at least once.9. Batman: Inverted coaster. Fun, but not the best ever.10. Full Throttle. Fun! really fun coaster, went on this one 3 times. Launched experience is awesome, goes slowly through the loop, which I love, then you get launched backwards, which is amazing. You have to try it.Now, for the non-coaster rides:Lex Luthor drop of doom: Great! I still love Falcon Fury at Busch Gardens best, but it is great. I think it is way more intense if you go on without VR. The VR could be better, I enjoyed the one in Six Flags Fiesta better.Justice league blaster ride: This one is one of the new generation shooting experiences, with 3D glasses and everything. It has a car that moves way more than I was expecting. I really enjoyed it.Water rides (not the ones in water-park, just rapids, log fume-type and such: small, not too exciting, but great if it's a hot day (expect long lines in that case)Did not go on other non-coaster rides so I can't review.FOOD:Overly priced, as expected for theme parks. I recommend to share a sandwich in a place near Colossus coaster. I did not want a lot of food given that I did not want to slow down my pace (had to go to ride the rides after it).BATHROOMS:This is one of the reasons why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. Some were really dirty. They need to clean more often. Also, fix some water fountains outside bathrooms, some barely have enough water pressure to get anything out of it. Ladies: no mirrors in bathroom, if that is an issue take one small one with you.APP and waiting times:Waiting times are really inaccurate, most of the time, and can go both ways (more or less time than predicted). App did not show waiting times for a few hours on one of the days. Map is useful to see the map. I did not wait over an hour for a ride, but I went Wed-Thu-Friday.General advice: If you do not have no-riders in your party, take cargo pants! or a jacket. In any case, something that has large pockets with zipper to secure things inside. If you leave anything next to the ride, better be non-important stuff (I saw people missing sunglasses, but you do not want that to be your wallet or car keys). Glasses and sunglasses with athletic straps.Overall, great coasters, but the way that the park is run leaves a lot to desire when compared to the way things are run in Disney or Universal. I for one was going for coasters, and got plenty of that, so I had a great time.",sof_a185

20,Great roller coasters but crazy busy,"Me, my wife and 2 kids (11 & 12) spent the day here while on vacation in LA. The rides were great, when we actually got to ride them. The park opened at 10:30 and between opening and 5 o’clock we rode 3 coasters. After the crowds died down around 6 we got to ride the majority of the attractions and it was enjoyable. But the first 7 hours we were there were a nightmare, between standing in line for an hour at a hotdog (60$ for 4 hotdogs) stand, drink dispensers running out of soft drinks,90 minute waits in line, rides breaking down that we’d stood in line for only to be turned away & coasters only running one train because the other was out of commission, we were fed up and were on our way out the door early. But the crowds had died down so we hung around and gave it a shot, if not for the last two hours of the day this would’ve been a one star review. I understand it’s summer and the park will be busy but all the broken rides and bad service at food stands was ridiculous",Shane B

Lovely lady let us use her discount so we basically bought one admission and got one for free. We were hungry so grabbed something to eat at the kettle place. So expensive for what it was. Everywhere was packed throughout the day and you have to queue for around 20 mins just to get a drink (it was extremely hot) Be aware the place is very awkward to navigate/get around. Massive hills (my son just had surgery on his leg).The rides were greatly themed though. We would return if visit California again.",Khailee5

50,Great fun with no wait!,"Since the park switched to operating 365 days a year, we decided to take advantage of what would be the “off season” and visit on a Wednesday in January. Being Southern California the temperature was a perfect 70 degrees and being the middle of the week, everything was essentially a walk on. (No waiting!!!) The longest we waited was about ten minutes for Tatsu. (Easily the parks most popular attraction. This park is full of coasters for every age and level. There’s a great section for little kids as well as carnival style games and rides. There were a couple of coasters that were down at the time, but that can be said for any themepark at anytime. (It happens) It still didn’t take away from the fact that there were still enough rides to keep us busy for a full day. Parking is right in front of the park, I believe we paid for it but It was less than other parks such as knots and Disney, so still a win. Plus it was right in front of the park. Overall a great time to go and avoid the summer crowds.",chieko1213

50,Wow!,Oh wow. I was so scared but I would do it al again. The best thrill rides I have been on ever! If you love thrill rides don’t miss six flags. Tatsu still makes my heart drop just thinking about it! Park opens 10.30 and closes at 6 but you could easily do 2 days here if doing all the rides. We were fortunate enough that we went on a quiet day so didn’t need to buy the fast pass. I’m very appreciative to the staff member there who told us we didn’t need it on that day as it would have been a total waste of money. I’m a wimp but I loved it. Don’t miss six flags.,mo71ey

I do think they should do the testing before opening and be ready for 10.30 as advertised.Apart from that, lines were minimal and we got to go on most rides, despite a few closures here and there.

Every ride had a wait of 5 minutes or less except Tatsu which was 20 minutes but still was worth it. Know I will give my thoughts on the rides I rode on my last visitX2 10/10: The best seat is back row as in the last car to begin the first drop in the left side. The ride is extremely intense and is the most intense coaster I have ever ridden. Don’t do outside seat as it can be very rough.Twisted Colossus 10/10: The ejector air time is present throughout the ride and you get flung out of your seat on the first drop. The inversions are also great. RMC did a great job with this one.Tatsu 8.5/10: The only flying coaster I have ever ridden and I enjoyed a lot in the front row which I found to be a graceful smooth ride with some intense moments like the pretzel loop which is amazing.Full Throttle 8.5/10: The hangtime under the vertical loop is amazing, the launch is fun, and you get some nice floater airtime over the loop.Goliath: 7/10: This ride has intense moments and one airtime hill but the midcourse break run makes this one of the worst hyper coasters.Superman: 6.5/10: Fun launch, great feeling of weightlessness, forceless drop, well I guess this is Magic Mountain’s best family coaster.Viper 4/10: I’ve had some awful rides on this my last one I rode in the front and tried to avoid head banging as much as possible and got a bearable ride but this things restraints are terribleBonus: Lex Luther Drop of doom: the best drop tower I’ve riddenOutside of the coasters like I mentioned in my last review this park doesn’t offer much to those who aren’t huge fans of coasters. If you love roller coasters this place is a must visit but if you come, come during the off months or get a flash pass, the operations aren’t very good here.",darkfalcon500
40,Great Thrill RIdes!,"A Great park with some of the best thrill rides in the world! We visited Sunday morning and arrived at around 11am the park was fairly quiet. We had opted for the flash pass and this allowed us to visit every ride within 5 mins. Overall we had a great time at the park however the park lacks of the finesse of Disney and Universal. I'll explain what I mean...generally when walking around the park you can see it doesn't have that ""quality"" that Disney and Universal have. Also one thing that lets the park down is the queues at the restaurants, I noticed most of the staff are quite young and seem disinterested in their work so service is super slow! We waited around 40 minutes just to grab some ""quick bites"". Overall I'd say this is a good park",guv112
50,Late Breakfast,"Escaped from LA and stopped short of the Grapevine! Busy, wait, but efficiently seated and served promptly after being seated! Sr. Menu appreciated! Always indulge in a side of pancakes. - remember Al Lapin founder, he would be proud of this operation! Hispanic server excellent and used bilingual skills in next booth with large traveling family! One young male server made balloon animals for young guests- a real hit! A good choice to anchor a long drive home!",Steve P
30,Cedar Point is better,"Nice park, but very expensive with flash pass, lockers for your bag, food etc...The rides are amazing but some of them hurts :(Anyway good park but I prefer Cedar Point for the locations, rides, staff and universe.",Stephen R
30,Fun.,"We had a great time the two days we spent there. However the reason for my three star review, on our first day there It was slightly overcast and chilly. We were not prepared, we had no sweaters etc. With me was my 23-year-old daughter, my two teenage daughters, my 8yr old son and my 4 year old son. We walked all over the park trying to find sweaters for my kids. Everywhere we went we were told to find the Six Flags kids store. And when we finally found it it was closed. I really feel that if you only have one store that really caters to children .. ie.. clothing/sweaters. Then it should be open every day. Especially since as we all know children always need something. Other than that had a good time.",Sabrina B
50,Excited day in California,"Six Flags is one of the must seen place near Los Angeles to have excitement and fun. When you are together with your friends, enjoyment will increase. Rollercoasters are really awesome. Visitor should wear shoes not slippers and if it’s possible leave your bag in the car or do not take any bag to act freely.Weekends are terribly crowded and must spent too much time on the lines. So a week day might be a good day to enjoy all the areas.And a suggestion to the management: please take care of the restrooms! I think six flags must have better restrooms. The cleanness is not enough.",E. Karatay
50,THIS PLACE IS A MUST VISIT.,"great rides, family friendly atmosphere , has to be done if visiting LA this summer. X2 will blow you mind.",fredsavage
50,Fun,Great ride lots of fun in the back or in the front. The middle is average. I always wait extra time for the spot I want,pinkglitterprincesss
50,Rollercoaster Fest! - April 2018,"If you like roller coasters, this is a park for you! A friend invited me on a buddy pass...so I couldn't refuse. It's been 10 or so years since I was last here. A lot has changed. Some rides are gone and a lot have been added. The first thing that caught my eye was the $25 parking fee!Now when it comes to roller coasters, I'm as big of a wimp as they come. But as my buddy said, I had to ""man up!"" First ride: Full Throttle totally caught me off guard with the sling shot launch. Yeah, it scared me...but it was really fun too!We were only there for a few hours and only got on several rides. Being early and midweek, there were virtually no lines. This meant re-riding the same ride multiple times in a row. We rode Tower of Doom (a drop ride) twice...first time with a clear view. But on the second ride, we opted for the virtual reality option. This made the ride a lot less scary as you didn't see your height.Of all the rides, my buddy indicated the X-2 coaster was the best so we saved it for last. We walked right to the front...again, the park was pretty empty midweek. We got on...after a little bit of a wait sitting there, my buddy said he hoped something wasn't wrong cause it never takes this long. Right on cue, the ride began to reset to disembark us and an announcement said to get back in line and that there will be a short wait due to a technical problem. After about 10 minutes the announcement changed to ""go to other rides"" as they were experiencing an extended delay and didn't know when/if the ride would come back online. So that ended our day.Fun times! But like some other reviews have mentioned, this park is geared more toward bigger kids (most coasters require kids to be at least 48 inches tall...otherwise the safety restraints won't properly secure them).",Kitman
50,Amazing,Great place to go for families with teenagers... buy the fast pass - it pays for itself - we had an awesome day with memories to last a lifetime xx,mellyjordie
40,Great day no queues 👍🏼,"We had a great day. Was there from 0930-6 on a Wednesday so quiet . Walked onto lots without waiting. We loved them all and done most twice ! Superman is scary, that drop! Not for younger children though",MLGTRD
50,Great park-get maximum with minimum spending,"It was our first USA amusement park and we loved it. We visited it on Wednesday during Spring breaks, we were worried it will be too full and thinking to buy the flash pass to ride as many rides as possible. But we didn´t buy it, and we did good. I don´t know if they were so well organized or simply the park wasn´t so much crowded, but even without the flass pass we did 22 rides (our favourite ones twice), without running, with time to eat and rest and leaving park at 8:15 pm.My suggestions how to get maximum:1. The parking gates open at 9:30, so be there around 9, to enter among the first. From the parking you have to walk to the entrance, where is security control (they check you everything, to me also pockets in my jacket). If you arrive later you can get stucked in the queue here.2. Go to the gate, choose the one with less queue and wait there till they open.3. First make the rides where are limited seats (because here later will be longer queues)-those are: Superman, Full Throttle and Drop of Doom4. Then go for X2, Tatsu, Golliath, Twisted Colossus (most required, if seems to be too long waiting time come back 1-2 hours before closing)5. During the peak time go for less required rides: all the others not mentioned above (Green Lantern and Tidal wave were closed during our visit, so I can´t suggest anything)6. Check also the map in order to go to the rides that are close to each other to avoid loosing time by runnig from one side of the park to the other.A coaster that is really for kids is Ninja-avoid it.They don´t update waiting times very often and even if it was written 45 minutes (the longest waiting time we have seen), we arrived and it was empty and we could ride immediately. Or even if it looked that the queque is long and waiting time was 30 minutes, it was fast and we waited 15-20 minutes (simply, always less that expected).Some rides have paid lockers-we didn´t have any backpack so we didn´t use them.2 hours (maybe because was getting colder) before closing people started to leave the park, we left 45 minutes before closing and it was already almost empty, no waiting times. So in the last hour was possible to ride many rides. I don´t know if we were just lucky to had possibility to ride so many rides, or it was a good organization of the park (I am sure in summer is more crowded), but we really enjoyed a day spent here.We bought the packet-accommodation + tickets for whatever day-if we subtracted from the total price of the packet the price of accommodation, in this way price of the ticket was only 50 dollars/1 person. So look for these offers.",Cannolaxxx
50,Loving it!,"I love roller coasters. And Six Flags doesn't disappoint. Probably the best theme park I've ever been to. While Universal Studios and Disney have their own coasters and thrill rides, nothing compares to the 15 coasters at Magic Mountain, especially if you are a roller coaster lover.I got a gold pass through online reservation. Turned out even though it was spring break, there weren't too many people in the park. But the pass allowed me to save all the queue time, which was 0 for me as I usually line up using the pass while I ride the previous coaster or travel from one ride to another. By the time I finish the ride, the next ride is available. This allowed me to space out rides without the need to rush from ride to ride, or skip a meal. I could've gotten away with a bronze pass but I'd gladly pay a little bit more. But a gold pass was enough. A platinum pass would be an overkill.I ended up riding 13 coasters. The Green lantern was closed all day. Didn't go on the Viper as almost everyone here suggested not too. Enjoyed every one of them. Stayed there from 11 to 8. My favorite would be Twisted Colossus, then Goliath, then Full Throttle. So much fun. If only I had more time, I'd ride them again.Food is pricey, but we just had one meal in the park (lunch) so it was ok. Staff were mostly helpfu. Perhaps not as enthusiastic as those in Universal or Disney, but still good service.I understand the park suits teens and thrillseekers rather than families. But as a roller coaster lover, I'd definitely give Six Flags Magic Mountain 5 stars. No doubt.",Samuel H
50,Brilliant,If you want to enjoy every roller coaster you have to be over “54” inches to ride the Goliath and the Twisted calloussul. I really enjoyed the X2 and Tatsu.,CathalNeville124
50,VIP experience is great!,"You are assigned to a tour guide (in our case - Emily, a great one!) who escort you throughout the whole park - no lines, no limitations on activities or rides, food (no candies, but that’s ok) or drinks (no alcohol, but that’s understandable). Great value for money since in 6-7 hours you run thru the whole park!",Airsealands
40,Probably the best amusement park in LA,pros:There are a huge number of coasters and other thrill rides and they all were great. We managed to get on most of them and had a great day.Cons:Parking was a rip offPaid $300 for a flash pass for 4 people which was expensive considering the park was not that busy and in a few rides the flash pass was giving delayed ride times.Check how busy the park is a few days by downloading the app before deciding to buy a flash pass. Also for a few rides the pass could only be used once.As we had a go LA card we had to queue for 45 minutes at the will call window to get our entrance tickets and as the park didn’t open until 10:30 it meant that it was almost 11:30 by the time we actually got into the park.,Mesh
50,Awesome but pricey,Like all big amusement parks you will spend money quickly. Six Flags was far better equipped for crowds than Disneyland. If you can afford it paying for the front of the line upgrade is worth it. Our teens ended up worn out because we just did ride after ride with no time in lines. Love the layout and the friendly staff.,MarkAndCathy
30,Great rides rip off parking,"We chose this park over others with our go LA card, using the card and another attraction on the same day made it good value, the rides are great, mostly roller coasters, feel there wasn’t that much for younger children so check this out if you only have younger ones. it was fairly quiet the day we went so I guess it would be a nightmare in long lines waiting on busier days, the parking at $25 we felt totally ripped off - scandalous as you have no choice but to pay, and the reason I only give 3 stars",corky k
40,"Clean and fun, great ride selection","Loved all the coaster options. Liked the SuperHero area and the portion themed for kids. Clean throughout. Friendly staff all around. Only downsize was there were NO dessert options, we wanted something sweet n fun....only options were funnel cake really. How bout some of those new extreme ice cream shakes or ice cream cookie sandwichs with all the dazzle. Decent food otherwise. No long waits, but it was early spring. Great time though, keep up the great rides.",bruce p
50,Always a good time,"Went during our 5 year old daughter's Spring Break. It was busy, but we were still able to get onto 9 rides, and ones that her thrill seeking Dad could enjoy too - we didn't even hit the kiddie ride section this time!Can't wait to go back when Hurricane Harbor is open. It makes a great day to visit the water park in the heat of the day, then the ""real park"" in the evening. Add at least one Premium Food pass to your party and get 2 free meals, a snack and drinks all day! Way better deal than any other theme park, way better rides. And Fright Fest?! The BEST!",Mya G
50,Awesome Times,"I love coming here with the family. There are good rides for the young kids as well as really exciting ones for the adults. Every time I come to Southern California, I come here. Highly recommend this place to anyone looking for extreme thrills.",Andrew M
10,Second bad experience,"April 2015 I visited this park while on the ninja my bag was stolen. The staff was suppose to be watching it. My daughter and I returned today April 3rd 2018 because we didn't gwt to ride most of the rides. We arrived about 2pm. I didn't want to leave my bags, so whole the children were on the rides I held their bags. We were separated so that asked to use someones phone and because of this we were put out the park. The security followed us and humiliated us!!! They then try to ger thw sheriffs to arrest us but they didn't. I have video but I can't load it",Nikkia R
30,Nice but not as expected,"We went there as a big group...the place is full of trash, dirt, the restroom are totally disgusting! Lots of shops close, long lines...The rides are great but really the lines sometimes not worth it.",Eranber
40,Spring break,Very nice rides n roller coasters. The bad thing is that the staff need to try to get to people quicker. I mean the rides should have all carts working. This would help relieve the long wait in lines. The guest service counter only had 2 persons and they sure took their time. We waited over 30 mins in line to inquire about something. Good tip. If you go with a big group make sure to send people to start the line right away as you get off one ride.,Esveibi S
50,Six Flags was Sick (In a good way),"My daughters couldn't get enough of these coasters. Lines were short in the early hours and non-existent at the end of the day. My kids wanted to stay until the park closed, but my nerves were shot. X2 and Tatsu were are favorite rides. Full Throtle was a close third and Green Lantern was the only ride which was closed (I was thankful).The park was pretty clean. There were areas where they needed to spend some time cleaning up gum that had fallen from people's mouths (or was spit out to disgust other park goers) while we hung upside down from coaster cars, and the bathroom near the entry needs a remodel and needed a good cleaning, but my kids thought that no one would go to Disney if they had ever been to Magic Mountain.",Jennifer F
50,This park is for the thrill seekers!,"Six Flags Magic Mountain is an amazing park with lots of thrilling roller coasters. One of my favorite roller coasters is the x-dimension roller coaster it is an amazing coaster where the seat spins 360 degrees.Also one of my favorite attractions is the fiddlers revenge it is a greatly themed area and an awesome roller coaster.This park is unlike Disney, it is more meant for those thrill seekers so if you like roller coasters and like a good thrill definitely go to six flags magic mountain",Tycho Loke
10,Six Flags Annual Pass is a Scam,"Please do not buy this pass!!! Stay Away!!!!They will take your money and not fulfill their agreement.I loved this park but now I will boycott them and ask my family members and friends not to attend.They took over $900 dollars from my family for no Services Rendered.Do not call them because they will claim that they took care of everything for you until the next charge shows up on your card.And they know this is a scam too, because they will give you attitude.I called today and they said they have no record of my previous call asking to cancel the membership.A SCAM THAT TAKES AWAY FROM THE PARK EXPERIENCE!!!THEY SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF RIPPING OFF FAMILIES.My Seven and eleven year old are upset too, so they will stay away from a long time.",Gustavo M
50,Still a Good Find,"Well, Magic Mountain still provides ride excitement. The park is easy to navigate and well maintained. It is an excellent choice for thrill seekers. It is nice to see some of the classics such as the Ninja are still around. The staff is willing to accommodate your needs which is refreshing to see. I was fortunate to go midweek and avoid long lines and weather was just right not hot. Park closed early due to it not being peak season but it was time enough to enjoy rides. There were a couple of rides closed for maintenance including the updated Colossus but, it was understandable. I will visit Magic Mountain again.",carlosI542RV
50,Family Loved The Rides,"Small crowd, easy to get through the gates. Many locals so they have all the tips, and tricks that they willingly tell.We purchased our tickets 24hrs in advance, to get $20 off per ticket, as we watched the weather to select the best day. A little cool, but sunny. We prepayed the parking to make it easier, and purchased the meal plan for $34.99 each. Well worth the money. The meal plan comes with lunch, dinner, a snack,and unlimited refill bottles. If spending the entire day, like us, it was well worth it!We would visit again,as this is our second park in a year,and each time, we enjoyed ourselves.",Bos2AusCyssan
50,Best in CA,"Magic Mountain is still the best park in California for big kid coasters. This is not the best choice for small children as the park focuses more on big, daring roller coasters. (For families with small children, I'd suggest the less crowded Knott's Berry Farm, which has something for every one.)Magic Mountain remains the teen and adult favorite for thrill seekers. Some of my favorites:-Lex Luther freefall of 400ft at 85mph. Note how the music becomes more frenzied and Lex Luther's threats more diabolical as you near the drop point...- X2 with chairs that swivel 360* and a track design that propels you in unpredictable positions on drops, inside loops, and outside loops. The first drop has victims in a sitting position facing the track as they fall.- Twisted Colossus - the new take on the wooden roller coaster. This hybrid steel and wooden coaster is fast, smooth, and races an adjacent coaster.- The Goliath - even though the rest of the ride is just meh, that first 255ft drop still makes this the best first ride of the park. Go in the front to experience those moments as you round the peak, waiting for the back of the train, and you can't see any track below. Delicious suspense.Lines for these rides are typically 2 to 4+ hours in the summer. Tickets are too pricey to spend all day in line, in my opinion. I played hookey in mid-week early October and rode every ride in the park. Each line was only a 2-5 min wait, with the exception of X2, the popular 4th dimension coaster, but we waited only 15 minutes for that one.In addition, the park is decorated for Fright Night, the Halloween-inspired theme nights in October (separate ticket purchase). I enjoyed seeing all the decorations during the day and will go back next year at night.Enjoy an exhilarating day at Magic Mountain!",Queen J
50,Thrill seeker,"If you enjoy roller coasters this is the park to visit, better out of season as queuing was very short and good value for money, managed to ride 11 coasters in one day.",Michelle O
50,Six Flags Magic Mountain,One of my favorite Six Flags. Great coasters (except for the Viper). My only complaint is several were not open. We did go at an off time but to not have your signature rides open was a great disappointment. The park was pretty empty and no wait in lines. One word of advice is bring your own food! $11.00 fora slice of pizza and $7 for a beverage is robbery! The Soda machines are $5. The staff is indifferent but you’re there for the rides. Very glad we checked the “is it crowded” website a couple of days before we went. It determined if we were going to purchase the flash pass. We didn’t and was very glad because it would have been a waste of money.,Tom M
50,"Just Amazing, Best park hands down!!",Did 1 day and this has to be our top park now. Hands down best coasters around and we have done many parks all over the world. Park was clean and very well kept prices for food and drink were good and for good standard of food. Ride times where at maximum 60mins but most we were able to get on and off within 30mins. X2 and Twisted colossus are out of this world rides absolutely top class. Will recommend to everyone this park is just incredible.,r3wbb
20,My kids prefer Knott’s,"So we are here today and the lines are supershort. However, my kids are ready to go home early. With all the roller coasters it’s either high thrill rides or kiddie rides with not a whole lot in between. We have never, ever gone home early from an amusement park. So this will be a first. We got here when the gates opened at 10:30 AM and it’s now barely 2 o’clock. They’ve got one more roller coaster they want to go on and then they want to hit the road and go home. This used to be my favorite park as a teenager. Now that I am pushing 50, I did four roller coasters and felt so sick that I’m not going on anything else. FYI if it helps, my kids are 17, 15, and 11, and they all agree that they want to go home early.",Tami C
40,Love coasters?,If you love coasters like my 28 year old this place is heaven . Now that they are open every day we went on a Monday last week and he rode every coaster only 3 were not open for a total of 21 roller coaster rides from 10:30 am till 5:30 pm. So he loved it no lines the longest was 15 minutes. Great to go off season weekdays.,istanbulrocks
40,Great For Thrill Seekers,SIx Flags Magic Mountain is open every day for the 2018 season. There was hardly any waiting in line for rides. The park still is not as clean as I would like but the rides are great. There is something for everyone old and young. The food is okay. Most of it is edible. The BBQ is good but stay away from the Chinese food at Chop Six.,Jjnkl41
50,"Open all Year, No Waiting","Now that they are open year round, it is the best time to go there. We went in the middle of the week and in the children's area there was no waiting in line, you just walked up and got on the ride. The operators even ask if you wish to go around again before getting off the ride. It was the same at the adult rides, their biggest attractions were no waiting. It may not be Disneyland but with no crowds it was the best.",Veronica Or Rob... H
40,Great experience!,Thrilling but enjoyable at the same time :) Had great time and great fun as a family of four (2 kids).,Yaprak Gulec Ogutcu
50,Fantastic Theme Park,"After our disappointing visit to KBF earlier in the week I was pleasantly surprised that this park lived up to it’s reputation as being one of the best in the US. This park is great whatever your age. The rides were world class, the park was clean, the food was great in fact the one and only criticism I have is no drying machine as you come off the rapids ride, we went on forgetting that it was February and like all rapids rides throughout the world got completely drenched. I’m positive that this would not have been a problem in the warmer months but it did unfortunately cut our visit short as it was just too cold to walk around soaked... For sure, one ride to avoid in the winter, trust me.... The park is definitely up there with the best though.",Dean L
50,Riding rides,I love Six Flags Magic Mountain! It is a great amusement park filled with some of the world’s scariest and most fun roller coasters.,Jonny Vegas
50,Great coasters!,"We are avid coaster fans, and 6 flags did not disappoint us! It was nice to go in off season. We got to ride everything front row, and back row if we wanted to. HIGHLY recommend if you are into coasters! Not a lot of other rides, but a few.",MamaspoonDiane
40,An AMAZING Amusement Park...If You Like Roller Coasters,"I travel the world riding roller coasters for fun and I can tell you with authority that Six Flags Magic Mountain is THE best place in the United States to visit if you love riding roller coasters (tied with Cedar Point in Sandusky, OH which boasts 17 world-class coasters, including some current and former record-breakers). However, if you're not a big coaster fan, you may find yourself a bit on the bored side, as coasters are the major offering and draw for this park.Magic Mountain is a 262-acre park that is located in Valencia, CA (kind of out in the middle of nowhere, about an hour north-northwest of Los Angeles), just off of Interstate 5. As of January 1, 2018, it is open 365 days per year. Parking is plentiful, with HUGE parking lots and shuttle bus service to lead you from your parking spot to the front gate. It is a VERY busy park; crowds can be unbelievably overwhelming! The worst I have seen it is at 95% capacity, with almost no place to park and lines for all of the major rides running at 2-3 hours and everything else at an hour minimum, including kiddie rides. If you are going, I cannot recommend getting a Flash Pass (Six Flags' front-of-line system) enough. Seriously, depending on crowds, you may find yourself only going on 4-5 rides over the entire course of the day if you attend on an especially busy day. Crowds can be OUTRAGEOUS!The park is built on the side of a hill; that means you will be doing a lot of walking uphill and downhill over the course of your day. Yes, it gets tiring traversing all of those hills if you aren't in decent shape! Good, comfortable footwear that offers plenty of cushion and support is an absolute MUST!!! You will likely find yourself walking upwards of 10 miles over the course of your day, so protect your feet! Walking paths are plentiful and easily traversable if you are on a scooter. Guests in a wheelchair are going to need people who are fit and able to push them if they don't have the upper-body strength to push themselves up the hills.Magic Mountain has NINETEEN roller coasters. Yes, NINETEEN (as of this writing in February, 2018). Let that sink in! And of those 19 coasters, many of them are outstanding and truly top of their class. You want to ride an incredible flying coaster? They've got it: Tatsu. Hungry for the best stand-up coaster on earth? Riddler's Revenge, Baby! Looking for hyper coaster (200' tall, non-looping steel coaster) with some fun air time? Goliath. Want to ride something super unique that you won't find anywhere else in the USA? X2, Twisted Colossus, Green Lantern: First Flight and Full Throttle. Got kids and you want to start their thrill rider training program? Magic Mountain has FIVE kiddie and family coasters that are perfect for little ones to cut their teeth on and transition to the bigger rides. However, if you're not the biggest coaster and thrill ride fan on the planet, you are going to find the ride offerings to be a bit on the weak side. Six Flags has been focusing their attention on building rides other than coasters over the past few years, including a 400+ foot drop tower, an impressive (and fun) interactive dark ride themed to DC Comics' Justice League, as well as some new and old school carnival-type rides. There are around 10 kiddie rides for your youngsters...but that's about it. If you're not into coasters or rides, about the only other thing for you to do (besides see some tacky shows) is spend your day in the water park, Hurricane Harbor, but that requires a separate admission and is not included with your Magic Mountain admission.Magic Mountain is a typical Six Flags park, so you are going to find things needing paint, trash on the ground and advertisements EVERYWHERE (eat a Nathan's Hot Dog, the Official hot dog of Six Flags!; come visit Fright Fest, sponsored by Snickers!; come ride the Full Throttle Coaster, brought to you by Corn Nuts!, etc. They even will wrap their shuttle busses and coaster trains in vinyl advertising wraps. It gets EXHAUSTING). Your admission is just the start of the money they want you to spend. Why would you park in the back of the parking lot when you can get PREFERRED PARKING for just $15 more! Why come for only one day when you can come ALL SUMMER LONG with a season pass for just another $30! Don't forget to add on a Season Dining Pass to eat all summer long too! And you would be silly not to add on Season Parking while you're at it? Why wait in line when you can get a Flash Pass today! Oh, you have items that you are carrying with you? You'll have to place those in a locker...and those lockers aren't free. EVERYWHERE you look, they are trying to charge you for something. This is something that Disney does at their parks, but Six Flags can't come close to competing with Disney and it just makes you feel dirty and violated as the day goes on. Rides are routinely closed, whether due to breakdowns, lack of staffing, or annual refurbishments. Rare is the day when you will find all of the rides open and operating. Disinterested and bored employees are everywhere and many are more interested in playing on their phones than paying attention to their jobs and their customers. The whole park--like all Six Flags parks--has a very rundown feel to it and that's a damn shame: Magic Mountain is actually a GREAT park! If they could just get on top of some of its shortcomings and round out some of its ride offerings a bit more, they could push it up to the best amusement park in the world. Don't get me wrong, I generally have a good time at Magic Mountain and it's definitely the best park in the chain, tied with Six Flags Great Adventure in New Jersey. Just be ready to shell out LOTS of extra dollars when you get there...or you're going to stand in punishing lines all day long and feel like a second-class citizen.Coaster lovers, Magic Mountain is your Mecca! Non-coaster lovers, there are better parks for you to visit. Spend your money on a day at Universal Studios Hollywood or Disneyland. Recommended...with concerns and reservations.",Jake G
50,Great park for roller coasters,"We went on Presidents' Day and had a great time. The lines weren't very long so we were able to go on all of the big coasters (except Green Lantern which was closed for maintenance) - several more than once -- and we didn't even stay until closing time. Thank goodness I didn't waste my $ on Flash Passes -- although they might be worth it for a weekend day in summer. There is a kiddie section which I am not familiar with, but this park definitely seems geared more toward the 54"" and up thrill-seekers. They have a great variety of extreme coasters -- they were all unique and fun. The staff seemed nice and to enjoy their jobs too (except one guy working at the chicken fingers & fries snack shack -- not friendly and I think he ripped me off -- didn't give me AAA discount -- and then wouldn't give me a receipt because the machine was supposedly out of paper and he couldn't generate another receipt). Anyway, overall, the park is what you'd expect of Six Flags -- fantastic rides and Looney Tunes cartoons and super hero trivia to keep you partially entertained while waiting in line. The last time I went to Magic Mountain was nearly 2 decades ago and nearly all of the coasters now have been added since then. I grew up going to Six Flags Great Adventure in NJ (and still go occasionally); while Magic Mountain appears to be a smaller park, it still has at least as many thrill coasters. If you like coasters, Six Flags is a must. Be sure to try X2, Twisted Colossus, Riddler's Revenge, Batman...pretty much all of them; Ninja was least favorite -- most boring of the bunch. Enjoy!",heather j
30,"Good thrills, needs attention","If you’re coming for the thrills, there are some great coasters. I realize we went during off seasons and refurbishments are to be expected but beyond that this park is in major need of some TLC. Boarded up areas and restaurants (not just those they were being currently worked on), areas and rides and queues in need of attention (cleaning, maintenance, painting). While we were there several restaurants and shops never opened (again maybe just because it’s off season). Rides closed often throughout the day, newer rides were closed (green lantern never opened and apocalypse did reopen the second day). Overall, the kids had a great time. I can’t imagine coming during peak days waiting in long lines and possibly experience frequent closures.",3kidtravels
50,Another awesome day,We had another great day riding coasters. Thank goodness we got a platinum flash pass. We rode every coaster and most of the thrill rides in under 6 hours! Lines? What lines. That flash pass was awesome. Can’t wait to use our annual passes on the next trip.,FarAway580183
50,Better rides than most and no queues as out of season,Great rides and no queues as we went out of season but on a nice sunny day.Great value for money compared to other parks with rides more suited to teenagers than smaller kids.,GengeEP
50,"Brilliant and, best of all, quiet.","We visited on Tuesday 13th February, and it was so quiet that we walked onto pretty much every ride. At 4pm we were the only two people on Riddler's Revenge! We're pleased that we took others' advice and went mid-week.Despite it being quiet, staff were friendly and helpful at all times, the vast majority of rides were running from opening until closing time, and many restaurants were open (though the prices in these are ludicrous, and I'd suggest eating a big breakfast before visiting).We thoroughly enjoyed our visit, and found the rides well-maintained and thrilling. A great day out.",eatanddrinkandsleep
50,Fantastic rides,"Wow, every ride is a little different, great experience and fun! The park is lacking a touch up in places but excellent value. A few rides did break down and closed for the day but heaps of options. I hate heights but did the Lex Luther drop and loved it. Go on a weekday!",Allan B
50,Great fun,The rides are crazy fun something for everyone. Best time to go is not summer and on Sundays to Thursdays.,hueyhue22
50,Awesome park for thrill ride seeks (adults and kids alike),"Our family of three thrill seekers (two adults and one 13 year old boy) visited Six Flags Magic Mountain on Saturday, 2/3/18. My son has been looking at park maps, videos and reviews of each roller coaster for months and has memorized the stats of each coaster so we figured it was time to make the 2½ flight to LA to visit Magic Mountain. We visited during off-peak and based on reviews on Yelp and TripAdvisor, I expected rides to be closed and the park to be dirty but that was NOT the case. We had a very enjoyable yet exhausting day at Six Flags. While there is no way we would go during peak times (e.g. summer, school vacations, holidays), we will certainly be back again for another visit.Pros+ Fantastic variety of roller coasters – standup (Riddler’s Revenge), flying (Tatsu), 4D (X2), hybrid (Twisted Colossus), strata (Superman), floorless (Scream), hyper (Goliath), inverted (Batman) and multi launch (Full Throttle)+ Short lines (most waits were 5-10 minutes; longest wait was Superman at 30 minutes). Pays to go off-peak.+ All thrill rides were open except for Green Lantern+ Park was very clean+ Staff members were helpful and informative. Gave great directions. Love that the Flash worker was honest about whether we would need the Flash pass on a quiet off-peak dayCons- Food – standard park fare. Would have been nice to have some healthier and better tasting options- Would have been nice to have the funicular working. Climbing hills after walking 25k steps is tiring",Deepa P
40,"Adventure and fun, but it will cost you.","Like most Six Flag parks, this one has plenty of amazing roller coasters and fun for the whole family. It's not cheap but if you live close, the season passes are definitely the way to go. They are always adding rides so if you haven't been in a few years, there is most likely something new to try.",HaasLife
40,Great day for rollercoasters.,"We went on a Friday in February (which is off peak season).Couple of rides were shut - which we expected as they advertise that on the website which I think is good. However there was still plenty of rides for us to go on, the wait times were no more than five to ten minutes for any ride.We made the mistake of not doing any research and brought the gold flash pass (Cost us $130 for the two of us) and there were hardly any wait times, so that was a waste of money. You can buy it on the day so in off peak season I would wait to buy it - apparently in summer/peak season it is a good investment.Paid for parking - $25 dollars I think? But I don't think there is anywhere really to park outside that is a reasonable distance.Obviously being off season a lot of the shops etc were closed. So there was only like two main places to get something to eat from.Food and beverage wise - in comparison to Disneyland it was a lot more expensive. A large drink at Disneyland was around $5 and here it was a bit over $7.. We paid around $50 for a baked potato, burger with a tiny amount of chips, large soft drink and a bottle of water.The park has wifi - which is a benefit for tourists with no international roaming plan.The park itself was clean - I didn't see any rubbish lying around.Definitely NOT a theme park and I wouldn't bring any young kids (probably under 10). There is no characters around and it is strictly for those who love rollercoasters. There really isn't much for younger children to do. I think there was maybe five child rollercoasters?Loved the Twisted Colossus and Full throttle! Goliath was pretty good too.",Krystal B
40,Thrill Capitol of the west coast,"I have been to Magic Mountain twice, and it has been a great experience both times! The park is loaded with world class coasters and will deliver the thrill if that’s your thing. This is a coaster-centered Park for sure, if you plan to come with kids or people who aren’t big on roller coasters, this park isn’t for you. But if you want to experience a world class collection of great and varied coasters then come! I have been on busy and slow days, and honestly the lines can be a bit long at times. The fast pass is a good investment if you come on a packed day. The food isn’t very good here, but it gets the job done. They are currently working on retheming some older areas which is good, because the park is a bit run down in some places. But the main thing here is the coasters. Be sure to wait for X2, it is worth it! Scream also was one of my favorite rides even though it’s severely underrated and is usually a walk on attraction. Advice would be clean the place up a bit and work on the food.",Kyle H
50,Christmas at Six Flags,"Went to Six Flags Magic Mountain Valencia with my grandson. Visited Santa Clause, enjoyed the holiday lights. Great rides for adventurous people. We loved it!",Wendy D
50,Adrenaline!,"The park is located right off the 5 fwy about 35 miles north of LA. Parking is vast and trams run every few minutes to pick up and drop off from lot.This is a fun place for those who love rollercoasters. Many to choose from at varying speeds and styles. One can easily ride all coasters in an off season day.There are a couple of water rides so bring a poncho or spare shirt if you’re into that sort of thing.There’s also a Looney Tunes section for the little ones with a handful of rides.Carnival style games are also featured for those who might like to try to win a giant stuffed animal or the like.Food court is OK, pretty average. If you’re looking for a sit down option there is also a “nicer” restaurant in te park.",Josie D
20,Why is this place so horribly managed?,"Great rides, great location, just awful, awful management. Rides keep on breaking down, and the place is filthy. I dropped my iPhone off of one ride, and despite having find my phone on and knocking exactly where to find it, and waiting until after hours for management to retrieve, oops not retrieve it, and given incredible runaround, never got it back. The story kept on changing about why Six Flags couldn't do what EVERY other amusement park in LA does routinely: Keep a working lost and found. I understand all iPhones are put in a big plastic bag at then end of the day and are either collected, stolen by employees or sold for refurbishment. LA Times even wrote a story about how incompetent management was in lost and found issues, and now I've discovered that first hand. Sticking to all the other well run amusement parks in So Cal.",Burbatana
50,Brilliant day out,We visited six flags with 2 teenagers in mid Jan. I’m not sure if we were very lucky or timed our visit perfectly. The park was busy enough to have a good atmosphere but not so packed that we spent all day in queues. We also purchased the basic flash pass which meant we didn’t have to stand in line and if you work it well meant we achieved around 13 rides in one dayThe park is a little tired in parts and the food was very average but the rides were all superb and the kids loved it.If I compare six flags to Disney on value for money six flags wins hands down that said it’s a roller coaster park not a theme park. If your little ones are under 10/12 I would probably give it a miss. Ours are 15 & 17 and they loved it,SiBarlow007
50,January Visit,This park has a lot to offer thrill seekers. This is the first year the park was open every day of the year. I expected that the crowds would be light on the weekdays in January and they were. Most rides ran one train and that was adequate. No waits over 10 minutes. Been to several six flags parks and this one is the best in terms of what it has to offer.,David R
20,Tired and in need of renovation,"This theme park is just tired and run down. The buildings and rides all need fresh coats of paint, the buildings need repair and to be updated, the landscaping is bland, and the food selection is boring. Every ride I rode today was filthy dirty, covered in rust, and looked neglected. I hate to be so negative but the park really looked as if it had been abandoned years ago. Most of the rides and attractions were closed today which was even more depressing. The staff were friendly, however. I just hope they can find a balance between their high school homework and working at a theme park. On a positive note, the new Justice League ride was fun! If all the rides were as nice and well cared for, the park would be amazing!",Heath H
50,Not for people who loves theme parks,"THIS IS NOT A THEME PARK. I think this requires repeating as you need to know that there will be no (or few) themes or cartoons, or characters, around the park. This is a park for thrilling roller coaster rides and boy did I love it. No waiting for long queues just for a kiddy 1 minute ride.Tips:1. Do not read any of the rides before going! You will be in for lots of thrills and have that shock value to boot.2. Go early before the park opens and ask if there will be a crowd (the staff will be able to tell given the early queues). Consider purchasing the fast pass if there is, and don't waste the money if there wouldn't! Buy the fast pass online as there usually is a discounted price.3. Don't be fooled by closed rides. The rides will close from time to time throughout the day and open up during the day too. However, to avoid disappointment, check online before going to see if there are any closed rides for the day.4. Download the app before going. There are wait times listed which allows you to plan ahead for minimum waiting. The map is also useful and you don't have to worry about carrying around a physical map.",Beatrice T
40,Worth the drive for Discovery Kingdom passholders!,"My family buys next year’s Discovery Kingdom passes and meal plans over Labor Day weekend every year, when prices are at their lowest. The free upgrade to Gold status grants free season parking and makes all of these benefits (parking, entry, and meal plan) available at Magic Mountain and other Six Flags properties. We drove down to Six Flags Magic Mountain for the long MLK weekend. The park hours were short (10:30-6:00 everyday) which made the 10 minute early entry for Gold pass holders even more important. There were large lines at the entrance gates at least half an hour before the park opened. Once inside, the crowds dissipated significantly, but being in the park before the masses helped us knock off a couple of the big rides, like Full Throttle and Tatsu before there were lines at all.Several of the rollercoasters were out of service the weekend we visited, and we heard from staff that that will be a regular occurrence now that the park is open 365 days per year. Although we were disappointed not to ride some of the rollercoasters due to scheduled maintenance, there were still many rides if you are at least 48 inches tall. However, even my daughter, who is 42 inches tall, rode Ninja with one of us on what seemed like an infinite cycle, while the other parent escorted the two 48 inchers on the larger thrill rides. The other solid family entertainment ride for 42 inchers is the arcade-style shooting ride (Justice League: Battle for Metropolis), which everyone enjoyed, but which broke down several times during our three day visit.Three areas in which Magic Mountain has room for improvement are in (1) the entertainment programming offered (zero live shows scheduled for a holiday weekend? Really?); (2) the reported wait times in the Six Flags app (often WAY off, and inconsistently available, to the point of being almost useless); and (3) missed opportunities to capitalize on thematic elements (you can do so much more than just name rides after superheroes).Another tip: be sure to wear earplugs— the comfortable kind you can wear all day. Many rides and even the park’s “background music” are ear-splittingly loud. It is much more pleasant with earplugs, and you can still hear everything you are supposed to hear.Also, a caution: X2 in particular is quite rough. It slammed my daughter’s head into the shoulder restraint so hard she was in tears for the second half of the ride. So, just because you are tall enough to ride doesn’t mean that the restraints will fit you quite like an adult. Even if you are an adult, the ride can still be quite rough — the “padded” shoulder harnesses feel more like a brick than foam.Still, the trip to visit Magic Mountain for these Discovery Kingdom regulars was worth the drive. It was a way to get a lot more value out of our season passes.",RXR94563
50,The best entrainment park ever,"I really love this park. Was our second time and was even better, because it was operating until 9pm!We drove so many rollercoasters that our head was aching in the end and we needed to stop. 😂We bought the gold pass, and it really worth a lot! We were able to drive all the rollercoasters and some more than one time due to the time saved. We are vegan, and was kinda hard to find something to eat, but I read later that u can apply for an authorization to bring food in cases of allergy or special meal needs, so I'll try to do it before going next time (because we'll definitely go back again!).",Nathalia C
30,A Six Flags day,"I visited on Monday the 8th since my school had the day off and when I arrived it was raining but not very hard. As we wait for the park to open one of the employees comes out to say that with the rain not all the rides would operate and that if it rained hard enough they would have to close. Not exactly the welcoming I hoped for. So as for my experience in the park there was good and badGood:Park was almost emptyCoaster collection is amazingSeason pass was a short processViper was closed so no one had to endure the ride the day I wentRode X2 2X in 7 minutes in the front and back rowsBad:Running one train on every ride open except for Twisted ColossusGoliath, Full Throttle, Tatsu, Superman, Ninja, and Drop of Doom never openedChop Six is awful compared to PandaExpress which was the only good food until they got rid of itVery little shelter from rainPark smells bad in some partsAwful restroomsBattle for Metropolis closed because of the automatic doors failing even though the ride is indoorsThe only reason I keep coming back to Magic Mountain is because their coaster collection is much better than any other California park with my favorite rides being Twisted Colossus, X2, and Full Throttle. Outside of Roller Coasters this park needs help. Unless you really like roller coasters or you traveled a long way to get to magic mountain I wouldn’t recommend it for families or just those who want to go to an amusement park to have a good time because of how long the lines get and the lack of decent food.",darkfalcon500
50,I'm a Roller Coaster Fan and Six Fags MM is one of the best parks for roller coasters,"They have 5 of my favorites rides in the world: X2, Twisted Colosus, Superman Scape from Kripton, Goliath and Tatsu. If you love thrill rides, you must ride them!For me is an excelent park becuase I don't mind to walk all over the park, but one thing that this place has is that you walk a lot!!! Is called Magic Mountan for a reason! So be prepared for that.Try to go to the special event for Halloween, the decorations an the spooky houses are awesome!Talking about food, I tottaly recomend the flatbread pizza and the ""Chicharrones (pork skin) Nachos"" from the Metro Park Pub. Delicious! And if you are tired, the Sport Bar is another good option to eat and drink.Also this place is famous for their funnel cakes! Thet are near the entrance. But if you go at the end of the day, you wil find a large line, so be patient.",Pily_Pocket
20,Poor infrastructure,"When you visit Universal Studios (Los Angeles) before Six Flags you feel the difference. They have good attractions, but infrastructures is very poor... bad maintenance ... no good options to eat, bad bathrooms. I also think that the chairs of the Coasters could be more comfortable and safe. I felt bad after playing in some. (pain in my neck).",MarciaPaternoJoppert
10,Worst experiencience ever,At the entrance they said only 4 attractions were closed. We walked the whole park and there were like 15 closed. We walked the park in an hour. They don't make refunds.,santiago c
30,Great rides but the food is a let down,"We visited Magic Mountain just before New Years after having visited my wife's family in Ohio and returning to LA on the way back to Australia. We got there at opening and did the full day there and the rides were fantastic. My wife and son did Cedar Point the year before and they felt the rides week on par. Since we only had the one day we got gold flash passes and that certainly helped us zoom through the park. We probably could have done even more rides if we had pushed hard. The downside came at lunchtime. Like most parks of this type outside food is not allowed but as my wife has some allergies we were permitted to bring some snacks but we certainly didn't bring in a whole meals so we lined up like everyone else. The first issue is that there is only one spot to get GF/DF food in the park. The second is that they were sold out of almost all their options. Third the lines move horrendously slow. Wait times at the three windows spread out across the park since places only serfe one type of food were ; 35 min for 15 person line, 32 min for a 12 person line and 28 min for a 13 person line. Just crazy especially since each line had two windows serving and 3-4 staff. While the ride staff seemed switched on and moved with clarity and purpose, the food staff seemed to be zombies just ambling between tasks and needing to recheck each order item constantly.All parks have lines for the food outlets but they move. Clearly six flags can do better given how other parts of the park run - pity this aspect dampened an otherwise great day. Recommend you plan ahead if you decide to go",Askani
30,Not Disneyland,Had fun with our teenage kids. Lots of thrill seeking rides. They need to put more associates on cleaning up trash. Lots of trash around the ride lines and under ride tracks. Disappointing that ppl cannot seem to deposit their trash in the proper place.,actippit
20,Park is not sympathetic,We were having a good time until we got to the Riddler’s revenge - my son got his arm crushed in one of the seats (and was screaming in pain) and the worker - Diana - started yelling at him making the situation worse. We were seen by their EMT 20 min later. This place is probably not a repeatable experience.,Evan W
40,X2 is awesome,"Magic Mountain is a superb place to get your thrills. Love the rides and the experience. I will travel back here again. A few tips at for me when I do go back. One, get here early. Two, buy a flash pass for the day, worth the extra money. Three, get a dining pass. Four, if you go back twice get a season pass. You will thank yourself and have a great time.",Colts9016
40,Bloody Awesome!!,"Attended in a group of 3, we all decided to buy the Flash Pass... The only line we had to wait in all day, apart from buying food. Yes it was expensive however enabled us to smash out all the rides, some even twice in our only day! What an awesome day indeed. We didn’t hire a car, so we just Ubered there and Ubered back to Santa Monica. Would have been better if there were a few healthier options for food not in just one area and food places staying open until the park closes. Would have been nice to have better lighting directing fellow riders to the exit as well so we all weren’t walking around blindly.",Laura Darin
50,Roller Coasters!,"This is NOT Disney! This park is full of various types of roller coasters that are thrilling to ride. Yes, there is a kids area with their own rides (including a few junior roller coasters) but for the most part this park is for people who are 48"" or taller. We opened and closed the place. Some of the buildings are a bit worn, but you can easily look past that because you're looking for the next ride. We highly recommend the Flash Pass. By mid-afternoon the lines for some coasters were past the 90 min. wait time. The Flash Pass got us right to the front. Tickets, Flash Passes, and a lot of other things can be purchased online ahead of time. Do yourself a favor and do that before you arrive. Then, you can enter more quickly and wait in a short line for your actual Flash Pass. Otherwise, it could be a lengthy entry wait.",S F
20,Flash Pass Sucks,"We bought the lowest level of flash pass, SO NOT WORTH IT. Granted it was the cheapest of the 3 levels, but we hardly used it (wait time was not too long - we went early on Dec 26). When it did get busier, we cued up a ride and just about the time we were to go on, the ride shut down, This happened 2x for the same ride. We only used it for 1 ride. It was a pain in the butt.As for the roller coasters, it's super rough - felt like I was having a concussion especially on the Viper. X2 was rough as was the Revolution. We went to Knott's Berry farm a few days later the the high speed roller coasters were WAAAY more smoother and you didn't feel like you get banged up.",PTAMOM2017
50,"Great attractions, but not like Disney o Universal","Six Flags Magic Mountain is an amazing theme park, with great rides, but mostly for adults.The only complain is that the security is not like in Disney or Universal parks: in many attractions (including coasters) you get into the ride and you have to PUT AND CHECK yourself that the seatbelt or bar is well secured. That really surprised me.Also, I think this is not a theme park for children and mostly for roller coasters lovers.PLEASE, IF YOU GO, GET ON THE SUPERMAN SCAPE FROM KRYPTON RIDE.",CAOLIVEROS
40,Fantastic Rides,"Firstly these rides are unlike anything I have seen in the UK. For the rides alone this is my favourite theme park but there are some things that need to be addressed in order to make this a 5 Star theme park.We found the lack of time wait boards frustrating especially when the app was not correct with wait times. Some queues said 2 hours and they were more like 30 and some said 10 and were more like an hour. It just couldn’t be trusted. This made it hard when planning the day! As I am from the UK I wanted to get as much as possible done so having wait time boards would have really helped as I ended up running out of time and missing rides I really wanted to do.Pro’sIncredible rides, Superman, Tatsu, Full Throttle and Twisted Colossus particularly stood out for me.Christmas themingCar park close to the theme park.Long opening hours.Great choice of merchandise.Merchandise not as expensive as other theme parks.ConsIn 2017 it was only open during weekends in December.Inaccurate queue times on appInaccurate schedule on appFood and drink quite pricey (but to be expected at a theme park)Several rides such a Lex Luther drop of doom shut.The VR on the new revolution was poor and not worth the wait. Being in the queue for very frustrating and it was badly organised.No single rider queue and rides often going with empty seats.I feel if the lack of organisation was addressed this would be a top class theme park. It’s a shame as the rides are brilliant but we nearly walked away from Full Throttle as we were just left in a queue quite a way from the ride with a rope across and no member of staff to explain why we were all waiting. We were just left there to wonder. I found the staff in the day were a lot better than the staff in the evening. The staff were very cheery in the day but seemed disinterested and fed up by the time the evening came.I was also disappointed by the lack of characters walking around the park. The app said there was a justice league meet and greet and after waiting at the meeting point I asked staff how long it would be before they came out and I was told that there was no meet and greets today.I know they have already addressed the days shut by 365 days of opening in 2018 but I think accurate wait time boards would be a great start, along with the famous attractions being open (it seems Lex Luther drop of doom was a planned closure). Just having a bit of communication during ride queues would be fantastic too.",Clare C
50,Christmas Vacation,"I really enjoy the park. They have awesome roller coasters. We really have fun, is good for any age, and is so beautiful the way is decorate for Christmas.",Brenda R
40,"Top marks for the rides, not so much everything else","There is a fair bit of criticism on here about the food, the queues and the staff at Six Flags Magic Mountain. I loved it - but I only went for the rides, probably the best coasters on the West Coast and didn't try the food etc. We went over Xmas when it was very busy and lines went up to 2 hour waits. Didn't bother us as we paid for the line-cutter pass and never waited more than 5 or ten minutes. Goliath, Twisted Colossus and Tatsu are all amazing rides. We managed to do all of the major rides with the express pass within about six hours. A truly exhilarating experience. That said, a couple of rides were closed suddenly without much explanation, leaving those who had waited a long time in queues uncertain what to do - whether to wait or leave and return to another long queue. Can't speak for the food, though did notice it was hard to find staff on the rare occasion we needed them within the park. Signage could be better too. Not a cheap day out, especially with the express pass and the parking. There is even a charge if you use the lockers - unlike Universal. But well worth it if you love rollercoasters. I'd have scored it a 5/5 for the coasters and a 3/5 for everything else - hence the 4/5 verdict.",Wasitanygood
40,Perfect for thrill seekers,"Having been to most theme parks in the area including Disney, Universal, Sea World, Knott's and Six Flags Great America, SFMM has to be the best in terms of roller coaster thrills on the West Coast. Sure the park is a bit dingy, employees aren't the most friendly nor educated, and the lines can get long BUT... c'mon, our family was here for the world class thrills and unique coaster rides. For that reason alone we got more than our share of white knuckle adventures. A pass holder friend of ours got us tickets for $25 a person the week before Christmas and we were thrilled to get that bargain. Lines were short but not all cars were in operation. Our shortest line was 5-10 minutes at Viper. Lines do increase as the day goes. For instance, Twisted Colossus tends to have a long line due to the length of the ride itself and only one side of the queue was open. Full Throttle was not a bad wait at 35 minutes on the week before Christmas. MM seems to be making a nice effort in playing up the holiday family environment, especially in the entrance/exit and around the backside of Revolution, up to Tatsu.Our favorite was a clear winner for all family members and that was Tatsu, the flying coaster that has riders suspended almost lying down with the track above. We were absolutely cracking up the entire time because of the unpredictable nature of the track and the unexpected forward under-loop! (It was our first time on Tatsu) Returning to the station on the belly reminded me of hanging off a swing in the playground, with pure childlike joy.I took off one star (or circle in this case) because some of the food was overpriced and caused one of us to run to the bathroom. Do not get the jalapenos from the grilled chicken salad at Food Etc.! Those things probably have sat out too long. Among the other disappointments was the ride quality at Viper. Simply no. Viper was amazing long ago but this old ride had our heads banged up on those crusty old headrests and harnesses. It should be updated or removed. Our trip could have been better if X2 was open too but we will go again and give that one a shot. Come here for the rides, not the food!",CHinSoCal
30,Great rides - some unnecessary terror,"We had a great day with thrill-seeking teens and the rides don’t disappoint. But my son had his harness lose a notch on Goliath - a coaster with upside-down bits - and the staff was remarkably dismissive of what could have been a serious safety issue. Really scary.Also, the park seems not to have invested in more than the minimal staff - at almost every restaurant by the evening, there was trash strewn and the bathrooms seemed not to have been cleaned literally all day. Not the kind of stomach turning one looks for in an amusement park...",Nestor D
50,Love the THRILLS,"My husband, three young adult daughters, and boyfriends went on Christmas Eve and had a fantastic time. We had given our daughters season passes last Christmas so we thought we'd go one last time this year. Since it's the holidays, the park was decorated everywhere. Santa Claus was there so we took a family picture with him. There were toy soldiers on stilts and carolers, music and lights all over the park. The lines for the rides were not long so we got to ride most of them. Twisted Colossus is such a THRILL ride, my favorite of them all. We all had a great time. It wasn't our first visit and will definitely not be our last.",Sara T
20,Great if you don't like rides,"Stood in multiple lines for LONG wait times only to find the ride broken. Speakers don't work and employees are too lazy to walk to those far back in line to let them know the ride was broken. The employees response when questioned was oh well, they will just think it's a long line. Seems like there is no employee pride. Oh, did I mention it took over 30 minutes to even get in the park?",RPVTravelmore
40,Fantastic,"If you love rollercoater you will love this place.However, the line is quite long so prepare some game to do while waiting for in the line.",Minmint T
50,Great Selection of Rides,This is personally my favourite of the Six Flags parks I've been to. They have a really great selection of roller coasters and rides here.I especially recommend Riddler's Revenge and Twisted Colossus. They keep the park clean and looking nice. They are open all year round too. The six flags gold season pass is a good investment if you might come visit six flags multiple times in a year.,Nonanonymous
30,December Visit,I think if I had paid full price for this park I would have been angry. The roller coasters were randomly closing and opening so it was hard to plan where we were going to go and a little disappointing as some of the coasters we really wanted to ride never did open. On the plus side the wait for the rides was minimal and the young people running the rides were more than helpful and professional. If you can get a deal on tickets than this is worth it if you have to pay full price I think I would skip it.,Hockeymom
40,Good place for fast rides...got repetitive,"My adult children begged for a visit to 6 Flags, so we indulged them on a recent CA trip. In general they really like the fast rides. Most of the lines on a Saturday were not too long, and the rides were generally fast and adrenaline inducing. The $25 fee to park seems excessive. The food prices were also pretty high. The top 10 fastest rides are pretty thrilling though, and mostly my kids liked it alot. I think X2 was their favorite ride of the day. They were disappointed that the New Revolution VR had no VR during our visit. a few of the best rides were shut down for maintenance. In general it was a successful day for the family; personally once there is enough for me, but my kids likely will go back again one day. Tip: buy tickets online in the parking lot - instead of $85 they were discounted to $51.",Montana_Rustler
30,Family outing for roller coaster lovers with grandkids just reaching the required height for the coasters,"While I am a ""senior,"" I still love riding roller coasters, and that is what this park is all about. As in all amusement parks, there is lots of walking, climbing stairs, and waiting. At the end of June, there were some lines, but not horrible ones. We started early in the day, which helped reduce the wait for many rides. My rating went down to a ""3"" due to conditions in the loading zone for Tatsu, which makes the area an accident waiting to happen. Between the rows of cars, the concrete forms a downward ""v"", with just a narrow strip of flat concrete in front of the cars to load. Bags or purses must be left on a rack on the far side of the ride cars, which then makes them accessible when existing down the stairs. I fell when I accidentally hit the edge of the ""V"" as I rushed to reach the purse rack. Some kids thought we were leaving and started to take my daughter's and my seats. As I turned quickly, I fell and banged my head, landed hard on my forearm, and twisted my foot. My family helped me up and over to a small sitting area by an elevator. A medical tech did come and check me out. Since I didn't lose consciousness, I was deemed OK and agreed that I was not in need of emergency assistance. I waited in the seating area with my grandkids while their parents took the ride, as I wouldn't let them leave without their ride. My surprise came when it was time to leave. I was not permitted to ride down the elevator (from which some people had earlier exited). I had to negotiate the stairs to the ground floor, where a staff member was waiting with a wheelchair. I was informed he would take me to the park exit or another location. After that if I needed a wheelchair, I was informed that I could rent one. I remain amazed at the lack of concern over a person injured on their property. I finished the day at the park, leaving at 9 p.m. or so, and it took approximately two months for the injured arm to stop hurting. I decided to write this review so that people can know to be careful loading and unloading on Tatsu and to not expect much care or concern from staff following an injury not considered life-threatening. There were radios in use after I fell, so I have to assume that higher up park officials determined the minimal ""care"" I received. Will I go back to the park? Probably. Am I likely to ride Tatsu? Probably not. If another park were to be built in the area, you can bet I would try it. For any readers who happen to visit the Great Lakes area, I highly recommend Cedar Point Amusement Park, located in Sandusky, Ohio.",Sally R
40,"Great rides, expensive food.","I went there the Sunday after Thanksgiving. The park was alone! We went into 14 rides (twice to Tatsu, X2 and Twisted Colossus!!). I was scared of the rides at first, but it was pretty fun after the first scary ride :). Twisted Colossus felt way harder than I thought but it was pretty fun. Tatsu looks way scarier than it feels. And X2 is pretty intense, but it was over pretty quickly. The food was really expensive ($25 for a cold hamburguer, even more than in Disneyland and Disney World IMO) and it tasted pretty bad.",Oscar C
50,No lines and tons of fun!,"My family did a week trip to this Six Flags and it was incredible! There was zero wait to get on any of the attractions and theres good comfort food for in between. The only downside was one of us got vertigo from being able to ride the rides repeatedly without a break so be careful. Also, getting the season pass was CHEAPER than the day pass! Plus you can bring a friend along for free with the season pass. It’s like a weird triple win!",Fallon F
40,Holiday visit,"Visited 6 Flags Magic Mountain, here from Washington state. Parking was fairly simple, though, with the cost of the passes, food, etc., the $25.00 Parking does seem a bit steep. We opened the park, and I appreciated the staff coming theough the lines asking demographic information for business purposes. They were friendly and entertaining.I will pause here to say, the Sunday following Thanksgiving is apparently a great day to visit, as the crowds were minimal.I did notice right away the great Christmas music and some decor. It looked very festive. But within a few mi it's of my visit I did notice that there is a lot of litter scattered along the paths, under the rides, and in common areas. I do fault guests....THROW YOUR TRASH AWAY....in one of the many, many provided cans.There was also a little disrepair, paint that needs to be touched up, dirty windows, just looked a little run down.The cost of food and beverages seemed high compared to other theme parks, and the quality was just average.However, the staff was great. They were fun, friendly and well informed. The rides were great, and we were able to ride repeatedly do to the lack of crowds.I definitely will come back, I just hope that a little more effort goes into a few areas that should be fairly simple fixes.",gmundell
10,1/2 the rides closed and long line ups,"I went to Six Flags in February of 2017 with my two teenage boys. It was my first and last time I will go there. When we were there, 1/2 of the rides were closed and the line ups were enormous. It took 2-2.5 hours wait for each ride. We were there the whole day and only did 3 rides! Terrible! Never again!",Sean I
50,Great Adult Fun,"Want thrill rises? Then come here.Wife and I love roller coasters and this place has them!! We spent the entire day on roller coasters accept for when we rode the Lex Luther Plunge of Doom.We rented the Flash Pass Platinum device which was worth every dime. It’s $120 per person but you don’t wait in line. You reserve your spot in line and when it’s time to ride you go to the Flash Pass Entrance and you are right there. Some lines would have taken 90 minutes otherwise; Twisted Colossus for one.Some of the newest rides like Full Throttle shoot you off at 70 MPH over a gigantic loop and then spin you around and then shoots you over the outer part of the loop. Never have I seen anything like it. Talk about an adrenaline rush.Lex Luther Plunge takes you up 400 feet or 38 stories and you free fall that distance until just at the end when you stop just before the ground; wildNot a place small children. Height requirements average 48” and some want 54”.Goliath is their tallest roller coaster with a drop of 285 feet and goes 85 mph. If you every wondered what driving off a cliff is like then ride here.Only ride I would not recommend is The Viper. It is older for one, and has seven loops but one caused the car to jar hard to the right on one and you slam you head into the safety bars. Everyone on our ride all shouted ouch at the same time.Tatsu has you ride while hanging off the cars. Do this one at night and you cant even see where you are going which adds to the thrill.Buy everything on line and your in the park in no time. Have a great time!! Mom and dad are entitled to some fun too.Helpful hints:Parking is $25.. Valet parking is $40.. pay for valet , the extra $15 nearly gets you door to door service.Food is plenty to buy but the lines are long and Flash Pass doesn’t work there. Plan the time.The Flash Passes are available near the lockers nd you will get a full demonstration. It’s very easy once you learn how.",Koyote1
40,I thought I was going to die on Twisted Colossus!,"I hadn't been to Magic Mountain since Goliath opened in 2001. I thought I could handle Colossus as I had many times in my youth. Well let me tell you, they changed it in 2015 and I had no idea until I was upside down hanging on to nothing sure I was at the end of my life. This park is for Thrill seekers for sure! Anyway after I survived that I didn't go on many rides. My husband did though. It was weird walking around the park seeing some old attractions just abandoned. Then there were others that I assumed were abandoned but later saw others riding like the scrambler and Gold Rusher. I didn't get to go on Jet Stream or the Rapid ride as both seemed to break down about the same time that afternoon. I did get the nerve to go on Tatsu, the laying down roller coaster and that was a pretty awesome ride, would try that again.They had some sort of meal deal bracelet that we purchased. It was a good value, but at the same time, the first location near the entrance didn't have any bracelets upon opening, and the other locations didn't open on time. It was going on 11:30 am and I just wanted my souviner cup and first soda to drink. There were plenty of food choices that were included.We were also there for Halloween Horror Nights. That was good fun. We had an express maze pass that made waiting in line a breeze. The mazes were good and spooky.",Elizabeth O
50,Jelly birthday,Anglican 5 year birthday we stayed at hilton garden inn the park was great looking beautiful for Christmas all the staff were great the lines were not long at all this was a great vacation on Thanksgiving week,Robert & Leandra 511
50,Truly a Great Amusement Park!!!,"Visited in early August with the Family. This was my first time to this six flags location. If you love Roller coasters you will love this six flags. Please keep in mind that we went in August and this location is in the High Desert of Califronia so the temps were in the upper 90's and very hot when we visited.We went to the park for 3 days. We are not locals, but we still bought season passes as it piad for itself after the seconf visit. I would highly reccomend the season pass if you are going to go go for more than 1 day as you will save a ton of monry by getting the season pass.The park is big. Not Disneyland big, but big enough where you likely can not ride everything in one visit. Be prepared to wait in long lines, but then again it's an assument park.They do serve the DOLE WHIP at this location which was awesome.The food is expensive so I would highly reccomend going online prior to your visit and purchasing the meal deal which will save you some money at the park.Again, my wife and 2 kids loved it. Be aware they do have a Kiddie Land, but if your looking for a park for the younder kiddos I wouls day Lego Land is your best bet.Parking is $20 per day, and if you don't get there at least a half hour before the park opens you will have a long walk to the front entrance. They do have a parking lot shuttle, but it takes forever for them to come around, so get there early at least 30 minutes prior to opening and you will be able to find a secent parking spot and be able to walk to the front.I'm very satisfied with the visit and Highly Recommend this Six Flags.",brian773
30,"Good rides, terrible ammenities","The rides at this park are good and purchasing the Flash Pass was a good buy as we never waited more than 5-10 minutes (premium pass is $120pp plus gate fee or $85).Security staff entering the park were rude, they made us throw out our newly purchased starbucks beverages which is a complete joke! Lines for food were 20 minutes long (selection sucked) and the sports bar was hot and stunk like B.O., we ended up leaving early just to go get something to eat! If they are going to ban outside food and drink they could at least offer decent food and drinks inside the park....which they clearly do not!!!",harrywCalgary
10,Couldn't Even Stand The Security Line,"Saturday Memorial Day. Security didn't open until 10:30am, the same time as the park.The security line is not a line... it's a mob... people pushing to get ahead.. no organization.. meanwhile you stand in the heat suffering.. got there an hour early and the security line is well over an hour.We couldn't take it. We flew all the way from Canada for this and the heat while waiting for security was hurting my kids. They just wanted to go back to the pool so we left.I'm sure Six Flaggs isn't the kind of company to return the money given they won't even hire people to open security a little early and let people in.Of course if you waited, once you are inside then you could have waited for the ticket line... Then the long ride lines.. so maybe 2pm before you get on an actual ride.From reading the reviews here from yesterday sounds people all saw the same thing.What a joke. I will go back to Disney where they at least care about their guests. I wish I could rate this a 0 out of 5.",James S
30,"Fantastic rides, humungus lines","Went there yesterday, a friday in november.We were there for 5 hours, didnt eat, and only got to ride 3 rides.Thats friggin crazy!I can always cope with 45 mins-1hr, but 1h40 average- thats just bad.All that put aside, the 3 rides we rode were top notch 👍🏽",Alexander J
10,Poorly managed theme park - Don't go!,"Here on memorial Friday. It's criminal, only 54% of the rides are open. The fast rides are over 1 and 1/2 hours wait time. They obviously have not staffed the park for a holiday weekend. Only one car per ride is running at a time. 4 tickets + parking $300. For this misery. They should be ashamed of themselves. Avoid this park like the plague. Totally mismanaged 😡Average wait times on their app are misleading because they average it across all the rides. Of course the small child rides aren't busy. 27 rides closed!This place is a rip off. Don't waste your time or money it's shameful",maui_tropic
30,Great ride but bad on a busy day!,"There were some awesome rides - Tatsu for example. But also some that were very similar to each other which left us a bit disappointed.It's only open Friday-Sunday off season which sucks so we were stuck visiting on a Friday (always a big theme park no no!), it also happened to be Veteran's Day where many business and schools were out so the park was packed; you're not allowed to bring your own food or drink in which results in a VERY expensive day, especially when a slice of pizza starts at $10.99! For the drink option we decided to get the unlimited refill ($17 after tax!)...as did everyone else in the park, which meant that the queue to fill was a good 20 minutes minimum. Also lots of the food places were shut which meant lines we so long for the remaining opened ones.The app was useless in informing you of queue times, although discovering one line is shorter than stated is a bonus!The staff weren't very efficient at ensuring the lines moved quickly as many seats were left empty on a number of rides per round. And the rides are on a loop around the park with no cut through paths so walking from one side to the other takes FOREVER!After all the moaning, we did have a good time, but it would have been a better time if things were a bit more organised.",Britinnz88
10,Operating like it’s going out of business,Went on Veterans Day. Should’ve known something was wrong when there weren’t any parking attendants and everyone was parking however they saw fit. There is only one bus to transport guests from the parking lot. Not enough employees at the gate. Concessions were closed. Ride wait times weren’t posted. The employees look like they hate their jobs. The ninja was operating one car. The queues weren’t organized. There were empty seats and no one was asking if there’s any single riders. People was skipping the lines. The restaurant Chop Stix went from open to close in a matter of seconds with no explanation. They should just throw the whole park away and save us all wasted money. I will NEVER go back or recommend it to anyone. Save your money and go to a real theme park like Cedar Point or Universal Studios Florida.,iCryssy
50,Lots of fun!,"I'd been wanting to visit the park for a few years and finally did last month. I wasn't disappointed! The rides were thrilling and fun. ITA with another reviewer, who recommended getting there early to be among the first into the park. The lines were LONG for some of the rides and I had to miss a few of them because there just wasn't enough time in one day. Also, it is EXPENSIVE but I think getting the Flash Pass is totally worth it.",Gloria M
50,Great fun,What a great place Magic Mountain is...wonderful rides many of which will get your heart pounding fast. Great park filled with nice people. Enjoy,Jerry K
50,Include this in your LA trip!,"This park is a great day out if you know how to do it! We travelled from Ireland and knew that we definitely wanted to have a day out at Six Flags and it did not disappoint. My advice to you...GET THERE EARLY! If the park opens at 10:30 get there for 9am. This might seem extreme but trust me you will thank me. You will avoid HOURS of queues and be the first into the park. For example we got there at 10:45 and it took 90 mins to get through security and that’s before you hit the queue to get into the park or pick up your tickets! We left and went back the next day for 9am and got parked right at the front, got straight through security and we’re one of the first into the park.Another piece of advise I would recommend especially on weekends is to get the Platinum Pass. Now these are pricey but for a once of annual visit they are worth the money. We skipped every queue, even the ones for the top rides and went straight to the top! We saved hours of queuing.There is free WiFi and prices for food and drink are around expected for theme parks.",Lauren K
20,Needs work,"Disclaimer: I am a former employee of Six Flags Magic Mountain, but this was six years back. This review is regarding the experience I had as a tourist many years later.Six Flags Magic Mountain has the most roller coasters of anywhere in the world. This is accurate, but a few caveats:1) The number is inflated by an abnormal amount of small childrens' coasters (four in total)2) The collection is not as well-renowned as say, Cedar Point3) This park is miserable to be atDespite its idyllic mountain setting, this Six Flags takes its famous status and uses it as an excuse for poor maintenance, capacity, appalling upkeep and refusal to provide good service. Waits for food are unbelievably long, and despite sweltering heat only two places on property (near each other) offer escape in A/C. When I went into one of the large gift shops towards the front, the cashier had no idea where else I could find somewhere to relax and cool down. I then spotted a corner of the store where people were actually squatting, and I joined them in an attempt to not suffer from heat stroke.The coasters are obviously the reason to go, and while the park has plenty, there are only a few highlights: Twisted Colossus, an insanely fun and quick RMC redo of an old classic; Full Throttle, a smooth launch coaster with a massive loop; Tatsu, an amazingly intense flying coaster. The rest are either clones of past B&M coasters (Scream, Batman), bizarre unique coasters (the mind-obliterating X2, Superman) or ones past their prime (Apocalypse, Viper, Goliath, Ninja). The combination of rough, intense and gimmicky (Revolution's VR, for example) attractions, a hilly, expansive terrain and humid temperatures can create for exhausting experience.A minor respite would be the new Justice League: Battle for Metropolis, an indoor 3D interactive dark ride that's admittedly impressive and on a Disney-ish level. Even better, it provides 15 to 20 solid minutes in beautiful air conditioning. There is also a small Cirque-like show in A/C as well.Yet these only improve your time there by minimal leaps. The restrooms are dirty, the buildings are in poor shape, tacky with advertising and frankly it doesn't feel like the employees care about your existence whatsoever. It's the prime example of coasting on its own bravado and not caring about anything else. Come for the credits, and just... don't after that.",goldenstate5
20,FRIGHT FEST 2017,"I usually go to knotts and Universal Horror Nights for halloween. Since Universal has been dissapointing in the past years i chose six flags this year. You need three things before you think your ready for this night.1. Regular ticket for the entrance. I got the season past since i come here at least twice a year for the rides. $80 (season pass varies from $85-$270)2. Maze pass $17 fast pass $27 (DON'T RECCOMEND)3. Parking ticket $25 or (exception you get dropped off/Under) $65 season parking.Once there if you get the season pass you need to go to the pass holder office to get your pass. If you purchase the maze pass online, DON'T forget your maze pass which you can only get near the stroller/lost and found building. If you did not purchase your maze pass online then you can purchase your maze pass at any shop. THIS WAS NOT TOLD TO ANYONE.There is an app to better help guide through the park but i uninstalled it soon after, it was unless confusing and it did not have the fright fest maze map to help me out. When i finally found a maze about an hour or so later im told to show my wrist maze pass? I had the ticket on my phone for the maze but i was told i needed the wrist pass. I was told to go to the shop all the way down the tiring downhill road (the maze was next to the superman ride) only to be told when i arrived that the only place to get a wrist pass that was purchased online is by the main entrance/lost and found. Unless i wanted to buy new maze pass tickets! WHAT! I didnt feel as bad when i realized i was not the only person not enjoying this night, there was several people also confused on the lack of organization. After three hours wasted i now had my wrist pass and was now all the way back in the main entrance. It is now 10:00pm and i have about three hours to enjoy what i can. I only got to attend two mazes and one freefall ride. The food and atmosphere is the same as a regular day at six flags.In conclusion, I spent more money coming here, I honestly DID NOT have a pleasant time here for fright fest. I will come here once in a great time during the day just to enjoy the rides. But i gave this a chance and it was bad. Perhaps the Queen Mary next year. Im yet to find my yearly Halloween there park.WISH YOU GUYS THE BEST OF LUCK!",Angdema13
30,"Fun, but tiring","Went with wife and 11 yr old. 1/2 of the coasters were just plain too much for us. So we stayed on the more moderate ones. If they had a Singles line, we took full advantage of those and skipped the 1hr+ lines. We rode one of our favorites about 5 times in 30 minutes. Place is a bit run down. Food lines are ridiculous. And $14 for a slice of amusement park pizza is a bit over the top. $5 Cokes as well. And $84 tickets to get in. Just too expensive in general. Go to Knott's Berry Farm for a more quaint park, smaller lines and considerably more affordable. I think Six Flags is more for the local teens who have season passes and meal/drink plans who go there every other Saturday...",Todd I
30,Season Pass Visit on Halloween 2017,"went here for the two nights before Halloween to get in the coasters and all the Halloween. Friday was great as the Park was not overcrowded and lines were short. easy to get to all major rides. Saturday was another story and leads me to give them a mid range rating. sorry we got here afternoon as all rides were now long lines and on avg. took over an Hour to ride with the heavy hitters in excess of 2 Hrs think X2, Twisted Col & Goliath., Full Throttle the really bad ride was the New One Justice League and the way it was designed to not move lots of people very fast. this ride is in three parts and the first two are designed to kill time and then you actually board the 3D ride simulator for the shooting part. the movement of the line is really slow and snakes outside beyond the Que. Beware as they just don't seem to care at the park. Saturday also had all the Headaches of too many people waiting for food & drinks in long lines and park employees just don't care as they are under staffed to handle the hordes of people who want their cup refilled and food to get energy. The entertainment was the best part of the night and loved the actors and Music next to Full throttle. all in all it was fun but tiring to wait in long lines, as Fast Pass is way too expensive for a family of 4!!!! I won't be renewing for 2018 because of frequent park problems with crowds and management lack of planning",Kerry L
30,Not the best,"Thankfully we had a season pass from the Chicago Six Flags so we didn't have to pay on the day. Also at the end of August it was extremely quiet. We went on a Monday and Tuesday and the longest queue was about three minutes!!!A fantastic collection of very very good thrill rides and good children's rides too.However, most of the staff look incredibly bored and uninterested, the place desperately needs a coat of paint. In my opinion they need to stop building new expensive rides and concentrate on improving the ones they already have.This place is very very expensive.Take water inside and leave your picnic in the car. Get a hand stamp and come back after lunch.",oliver a
50,Fright fest Night,This never gets old. Roller coasters galore and during fright fest even better. Have fun all day and make sure to get your season pass that you can use at any Six Flags in the USA !!! Next up San Antonio TX six Flags !!!!!!!!!!,OGRAIDERS
10,What a dump!!!,"Seriously I’m surprised people don’t die here on a daily basis.There are young young untrained kids working the ticket booth and they couldn’t care less about customer service.Paint is peeling everywhere, sticky everywhere you touch, and just flat out rundown.Definitely not a wholesome family day.Food is SO expensive and you can’t bring one thing in.Just gross.",NATNCHAP
10,Six flags is a DUMP!!!!!,"Half of the roller coasters were closed!! It’s all up hill walking, and dirty!!! There was no soap in any of the bathrooms and a small bottle of water was $4.95, ridiculous…considering a 24 pack is only 3 something😡 The parking lot is full of potholes and all of the asphalt is crumbled. Parking is $25.00/ car! Would definitely not recommend this park!",Jules
40,Intense!,"We had a blast at Six Flags. Just walking around the park hearing all the coasters around you is enough to get your adrenaline going. Staff didn’t keep lines moving like they could have and things didn’t flow as nicely as they should have but we didn’t wait too long for most rides overall . Food and drink was a little pricey but comparable to other theme parks.Great roller coasters, lots of fun for thrill seekers. Not quite as clean and organized as other theme parks.",Britta_D_5
40,Great roller coasters,"Come to this park if you love roller coasterws, there's loads of them. The ones on the right of the park are better than the ones on the left, as you come in, as they are newer. They still appear to be expanding the park into the car park. Food and parking are expensive.",09robbins
50,Best Amusement Park!,If your are looking for thrills this Amusement park has it all. Had an absolute blast and would recommend to anyone. *** Bring ibuprofen and motion sickness pills!!,Greg P
50,Not for the feint hearted!,"We went on a Monday (about 28th) in late August; if you intend to go in late August, check on the website that the park will be open - as we were planning our californian trip earlier in hall year, the website said it was due to be closed during weekdays in the last week of August.Queues - none at all! If we'd have bought a flash pass it would have been a waste of money.Rides - brilliant! Mostly full on, scary roller-coasters that were absolutely brilliant. X2 is the scariest thing I've ever been on and the green lantern is the most jerky I've been on. Colossus and Goliath were simply brilliant too.Food - not bad, queues for food and drinks were longer than those for the rides!The park was very hilly though, and it was an incredibly hot day. It was really tiring as the result.We all loved it and I strongly recommend it if you are a coaster fan - this is not a Disney type theme park. It's a pure coaster park.",RichardN28
40,If you like Roller Coasters then this is your park!,"We have annual passes to our local Six Flags in Georgia and we decided to visit the California park. As you know, each Six Flags has its own special focus and this one is definitely coasters. There are several coasters in every kind of configuration you can imagine! If you love coasters then you have to go on The Twisted Colossus. I still have flashbacks from that ride. Wow! There is also a kid's area. There are also a few intermediate rides like the Ninja. There is a water park right next to the main park for an extra fee.",Tonya Syers
50,FRIGHTFULLY good around Halloween!,"My review is second-hand, since I am not into scary mazes, but my teens LOVED Fright Fest at Magic Mountain! They were able to get through all 8 mazes and a couple of thrill rides from 7:30 PM to 1 AM last Friday night. Yes, the mazes are a separate price, but with the special Six Flags had for Annual Passes (get the rest of 2017 and all of 2018) and a family of 4 getting an upgrade with free parking (usually $25), it was a SCREAMING deal (see what I did there?)! I admit that I made a bee-line for the Sports Bar where I plugged into my laptop to catch up on work, but was able to amuse myself with some snacks and the street entertainment beforehand. The decorations, wandering monsters and special effects are great fun! I normally love Tatsu, Goliath and the Riddler ride for a good time, so I am looking forward to returning for the Holidays with my free parking (and without my laptop).",Simiopolis Utahn
20,Disappointed!,During my visit for the first time ever my car was keyed while I was visiting the park and was told it was my fault for visiting the park and assumed the risk when I went to complain about it to park officials. And I have yet to hear from anyone,Bernard H
50,OMG thrill central,"We love thrill rides and this is thrill central, in the middle of no where this park is an oasis of steel mountain coasters - the park gates open and you see thrill seekers running to their early morning rush! We bought the flash pass which I highly recommend the park has long opening hours but the queue didn’t get smaller as people flood in all day some rides had queues of 90mins+ we waited 10 max with flash pass,and ride every ride at least once so worth the money. The X ride was the best coaster I’ve ever ride and I’ve rode a lot!! The park gets very hot as not much shelter but we love the sun just a warning for families, we stayed for the scare fest mazes and once again these get very busy queue jump pass an extra $30 but again we did all the mazes so worth it good thing about this park you only need passes for the mazes you can enjoy the scare zones that were really good with just park entry tickets so no extra cost and unlike Universal they don’t close the park so we’ll done!! Ride the rides in daylight-then for an extra thrill in the dark !! Amazing theme park but in the middle of no where will recommend and I will be back.",Richardat10
30,A bit disappointed,"My husband and I are in CA to celebrate my 40th birthday and Six Flags MM was our first stop. With tickets already bought we head for the first line which is security. It was ridiculous the organization of how this process went. We had bought a season pass (good for any sf) so we got in that line. While in line my husband went to the bathroom. He shared for the park to just open how nasty the condition of the bathroom. We get our seat pass processed and get into the gold member season pass line which got us in a few minutes early. We ride X2, which was great and head to another ride. We couldn’t tell if it was open and ended up on accident going through the fast pass line where we were told wrong way. All the bathrooms were nasty as I used one 30 minuets after park opened and of course they got worse as the day went on. I can’t imagine what they are like in summer time. All the food lines were absolutely packed so you were going to wait at least 30 mins in line. I skipped food bc I wanted to ride. We were in line for Goliath and had been for about 50 minuets when 5 people broke in line. We were still about 15 minuets to ride. Not sure how they made it through the whole crowd, but they did. I was going to say something, but for safety reasons my husband said no. There was disorganization at the rides and most of staff unfriendly. A good note, on Superman, a worker saw my bday button and had the ride sing to me. It was a fun day and I have good memories, but this Six Flags needs some help.",wideeyed20
10,Not worth it,A lot of rides were closed. Pricing is absurd for what's offered. Several rides down or 'delayed'. Book a full day at Disney and enjoy your day more. It's a big no-go!,Ivan C
50,Ideal for Thrillers,"Looking for roller coasters in LA?Cant find them?Go here!This is one of the best theme Parks in the world.Ranging from SCREAM,Twisted collussus and MANY MORE.You will sure have a wonderful and scary time there.I think that if you bring small kids along,You would have to leave them at corner,since those roller coasters are only meant for 13+Aged year olds.Therefore,If you have kids,Just go to Universal studios Hollywoods.They are sure going to have a fun time there!",LoveTravel716121
50,Roller Coaster Capital of the WORLD,"Have been a season pass holder for this park for over 7 years. Best rides in American, they have over 12 high speed roller coasters that are just to die for, X2, Goliath, Scream, Tatsu, Superman, etc.... This park is a must for any roller coaster fan.My favorites are X2 and the new Twisted Colossus.Save time and energy if you go on a weekend by the flash-pass for head of the line no wait thrills, cost from $50.00 per person extra up to $100 per person for the Platinum flash pass which lower wait time to less then 10 minutes and allows you to ride twice on some of the rides. This cost extra on top of the admission or season pass.",c g
50,October is the best time to go!,"Bought our tickets online for $55...much cheaper than Disneyland! Only a few of the rides in the park were closed, but there were a majority of the roller coasters available. What a great time to be in the park...no lines at all, and the weather was great. Some of the roller coasters here are crazy fun...and very fast. If you are a thrill seeker, this is the park for you.",JimJ3333
40,Good rides,The rides are amazing! Lots of thrill rides that are insane!Only real complaint is they need to get the people who budge in line under wraps. So many times there was one person in line and all of a sudden a handful of people would push their way through and meet up with that 1 person. Other parks have no tolerance for this and Six flags should be the same. Let me clarify these are teenagers and adults. Not someone who had to take their kid to the washroom.,Ashleyelizabeth88
40,Fun family outing,"This was our first time with our boys (10 and 5 year old) to Six Flag Magic Mountain. We had a blast! Many roller coasters to ride, even for our youngest (42 inches). The park is huge, definitely wear comfortable shoes and clothes (quick dry for those wet rides). We got to experience Freight Night, music and character was great. Overall the park was clean. We may have started an annual trip since we are members 😉",tuf_travelers
50,Had a blast!,Everyone was so nice!! Very professional and informative! The park was clean! Lines were not long. It was a pleasant atmosphere! We also went to fright feast it was amazing. They did put a scare in me! We will be going again (soon).,lrbrattyprincess
50,Not real impressed,"The place was dirty, unfriendly miserable staff , high prices for under mediocre food. One bathroom we went into was like walking into a swap . The grounds were unkept, real weedy and trash everywhere. Peeling paint on everything. Just rather gross.",Colleen3737
30,Thrill ride park,Thrill ride park That is really geared towards teens and 20 somethings. Tons of energy and lots of fun but it can get a bit rowdy on weekends. It is my understanding they are now going to be open year-round,1kenny
50,Awesome place,"We were lucky enough to go on a quiet day so no queues and got loads of rides in, Twisted collosus and superman are stand out rides. great place",Gary B
50,Thrill Central,"Despite some reviews reporting that the park is rundown and out of date, we found that couldn't be further from the truth. This park offers something for everybody, however if you are a thrill seeker this park is a must! From standing roller coasters to twisting, turning, looping and insanely tall swooping coasters that will leave your heart in your mouth, we could not recommend it enough. The park opens until 11pm or 1.00am depending on the time of year, with most coasters running until close. If you are lucky enough to be there in September and October over a weekend, you'll experience the fright nights from 7pm, which are quite terrifying but good fun!",Jessgreen17
50,Amazing!,"Six Flags is the best theme park franchise in the world. X2 is the best ride in the world. Period! If you like your rollercoasters to be extreme, this is the place to visit. Per square foot, there are so many thrill rides, it takes more than a day to ride them all. Buy your tickets online to save a few dollars and be careful not to get ripped off by the food outlets. Expensive! Other than that, it's a perfect place to have fun. I say again, X2 is the greatest rollercoaster ever. One ride on it was worth the entrance fee alone.",Dan5515
50,Lots of fun,"My daughter and I had a great time at Six Flags. The rides were a lot of fun and the staff were,on the whole, very helpful and friendly. The only problem we had was with the breakdown of a mobility scooter. I had an ankle injury on the day of our visit and the scooter broke down and it took 30 minutes to get a replacement. Other than that, the visit was great fun.",David F
10,Don't bother.,"As 2 young adults, 25 and 30, we came to 6 flags reading about an awesome theme park with great roller coasters.We stayed for 1 hour and left.In this time we managed to go on 2 rides and wait in line for one that was broken down.After being to Disneyland and Universal Studios the 2 previous days, this was an extreme disappointment.The park is run by kids who look like they should still be in school. Not very confident on safety protocols.It was extremely hot in the sun and the X2 had broken down with people on it in full sunlight.None of the kids knew what to do or how to help the poor people who were strapped into the ride out in the sun. On top of this, the peanut on the microphone spoke over the PA so that not one person could understand him.This place hasn't had any maintenance in at least 5 years and everything is extremely run down and unsatisfactory.I didn't care about spending the money as it had allowed me to write this review.You would have a much better time at the local playground.Don't bother to waste money buying flash passes as the rides are empty and they are well over priced.I can't see this place being open for much longer where it is and the state that it's in.Save your money and go explore something else in LA.This place is rubbish",JoeroyJohnson
10,Run by kids and rides malfunctioning,"Today we went to @SixFlagsMagicMountain 🎢We left after 20 minutes and 2 roller coasters. They were pretty fun and scary but the scariest thing is how run down the park is and it's run by kids!! We lined up for the x2 ride and it malfunctioned and ppl were stuck on it in the sun for ages!!! Fk that. The place is creepy AF. It's got a horrible vibe and the staff/attendants are rude.When we asked if there was a problem with one of the roller coasters (which there clearly was) all we got told was 'awww there's gonna be a delay, experiencing technical difficulties' NO WAY! Just be honest and tell the ppl lining up that the ride is not gonna work for at least another 45 minutes with poor ppl stuck on the ride, in the sun!I cannot believe that every ride at the place is literally run by 16 year olds. Don't even bother. It's a s#it hole.",Fleur F
50,no lines,"it was a pretty great day to be at the park. when i got there only the first parking lot was being used so i figured lines would be pretty short. but when i got in i found there were no lines at all with so many rides for everyone to be spread around. was really glad i didn't spend money on the flash pass with no one there on a tuesday in sept. didn't get a chance to eat much food while i was there, just had a funnel cake and beer. prices are as expected at a place where there is a captive audience. all the roller coasters i got to get on were great, 3 or 4 rides weren't open that day. that's alright with me, it will leave something new for my next visit. my favorites out of all the coasters i rode were x2 and the drop of doom. the drive from lbc only took an hr to get there and an hour and a half to get home at 6 pm. overall, a great trip and we'll be back.",J S
30,Ghetto Disney,"Last time I was here was in the 70's, so things have changed quite a bit. I was there on a Saturday in September. It was busy, but not crazy. I should have purchased a Fast Pass to avoid the lines. Wish there would have been a Fast Pass for the food & drink lines. Those lines moved slower than the ride lines. Nothing like seeing one person working the counter and two others just hanging out in the food shack doing what looked like nothing. The food is very overpriced for what you pay for. If you like coasters this is the park to go to. Overall it feels like a ghetto Disneyland. No mirrors in the bathrooms because there would be graffiti scribbled all over them. The Fright Fest was fun, wish they would have done more with that.",JudgeDredd76
50,So many rollercoasters,Massive park with 15+ massive rollercoasters. So many that even a rollercoaster enthusiast had to tap out and miss a couple! Park is very very large. Lots of walking and can get very hot. Good value for money.,Mel T
30,Fun,"U have to love fast twisted dropping fast rides. Half of the people are great, the staff are great but the other half are problem people. Cut in lines because no workers/security around, lack of respect to others- not on open rides. Example- Batman ride u go through a enclosed cave and that is where problems occur. Very expensive to eat there",allana s
50,"Check wait times before buying flash pass, check for online discounts","Visited on a Monday in September. Wait times were close to zero (5min or less on most rides) except for X2 (still only 15min). That made the day a great after reading about wait times of up to 2hrs.Make sure to check online for tickets. We scored $30 per person discount for direct online booking 3 days in advance.Once you book tickets expect to get several follow up emails with offers for food/drink advance purchase discounts plus the Flash Pass. This is their front of line/express pass equivalent but with 3 different categories which can add up to $100 extra per person. Before you buy the Flash Pass make sure to check third party web sites of current/forecast wait times. We were ready do spend the extra money until we checked and could see the day before wait times and forecasts were saying 5-15 minutes. So glad we checked and saved $400 - would have been very annoyed to pay that and then find there was no wait anyway.If going outside peak season it is also worthwhile checking ride closures in advance. About 4 rides closed during our visit.Many reviews comment about the park being run down. I would disagree. Sure, it is not as perfectly manicured as Disney/Universal but then not much is.The rides are fantastic. We always be remembered as where our daughter abandoned all previous fear on rides and went on everything.",Neulara
30,Great for thrill seekers,"Magic Mountain is a great place for people who love roller-coasters. We went on a Thursday because it is the only day during the week that they are open past 6:00pm. I was glad that we went during the week because we were able to get on the rides fairly quickly. My daughter was able to walk right on a few rides, but no ride lasting more than 30 minutes. It cost $25 to park which, unfortunately can be expected. I heard that the weekends are always crowded which I think is because they offer annual passes for the same price as day passes, so all of the locals are there on the weekends, so highly recommend going during the week. They say no food or water, but everyone had food and water. I highly recommend that you bring some with you because there was not one thing in there that was less than $11,not even a slice of pizza. (Which was not at all impressive looking) The souvenir cup was $30. They offered a discounted rate if you bought 2 or more, but $30, really!? My daughter and I ended up splitting the chicken strips which came with fries which was plenty to get through the day and eat somewhere else when we left the park. There are food places throughout the park, but it is very dependent on when you get hungry on which luck spot you will be on what food you are stuck with purchasing, but everything seemed to be $11, $12, $13 on up. And not very impressive food either. It is very hilly place, which hence ""Magic Mountain"" so we got a great workout. lol. The rides were great if you love roller coasters. I was surprised that there were no place to charge your cell phone. I was on a constant lookout because I do not like roller coasters, so spent a lot of time waiting and nervous that my phone was going to die. So again, biggest recommendations, go during the week and bring snacks and water.",Michele S
10,Terrible Membership Program/Customer Service,"I have gotten a membership fall 2016 with some friends since I was going to be visiting the theme park a couple time in 2016 and 2017..! I was being charged for an overdue payment that wasn't correct there was a misunderstanding.! Yet to be notified, I was just being charged more .! Thats why I decided to call customer service and was talked to right away in a bad tone then bringing up my situation I was being talked to wrong and not helpful at all .!! Felt very disrespected.! Never get a membership at six flags don't recommend it ! Unless wanna be having issues with them .!",CEOAgencyCorporation
30,The Magic is gone,"Magic Mountain what is going on? How did you become so run down? I grew up in Santa Clarita and this park has let itself go. I am shocked. Does the park have a Gardner because there are weeds growing through the sidewalks as if nature is trying to reclaim it's space. The bathrooms are in disrepair and dirty. There are nails and sharp objects sticking out every place. No VR headsets for the all ""New Revolution"". Worker claimed they are updating the video for Christmas and won't be ready until November. What about a Halloween theme? Not very crowded. Probably the last visit I will be making. Spend some money on maintenance of the park.",natalie b
10,Security Team and Customer Care Complaints,"Good afternoonI would like to register my complete discontent and disappointment regarding the professionalism the security team of Six Flags Park in LA , as I was there with my family on August 19, 2017 we were Expelled and put out of the park by the security team Without any reason for such abusive behavior regarding the security team of park.I was just smoking a regular cigarette in a reserved place and allowed by the park when Mr. Luiz and Mr. Xavier( Security team responsible) approached to me and for my surprise… advising and they are saying that I could not smoke in that place ... without any questioning from my side .... so immediately I was trying to find a trash to put out the cigarette…again, immediately I went through to a trash looking for to play out the cigarette .... when I returned to them, the security team Luiz and Xavier , they immediately said that I needed to leave the park ...... so many times I was trying to explain this mistake and saying …I apologize and I did not understand the reason or act I had committed for that bad behavior and Power on the part of the security team sides .... I tried several times informs them that I was looking for trash to throw away the cigarette, I swear , promise , I had not disrespect the Mr Luiz and Mr Xavier any time .... They can not to do this with me and my family, because the visit was a great dream and we could not be interrupted for such a futile reason on the part of a team.Security team is totally unprepared, abusive , unexpected and they can´t have these behavior and power for decision with the tourist and customer ....I and my Family are facing a great bad feelings and physiologic disturb with this situation., It´s not Fear, do not combine with the USA people behavior that I visit your country so many tomes and I love thereI demand the full action and necessary measures of the administration of the park, beginning with the reimbursement of Tickets and Fast Pass that we bought, + Flight tickets and Hotel costs, as well as the retraction by the security team to my family ..... reinforcement Neglect and lack of education and total , aggressive behavior, uneducated, are totally unprepared ... we were treated with threats, insults, aggression .... I ask once again the management of SIX FLAGs a correction and apologizes of the fact to my family as well as an immediate solution of our reimbursement and retraction of excuses .... I know very well our rights just as I will not rest until I have solved this great psychological disorder And financial assistance that the security team has I really want to resolve it in a friendly way, without involving the newspaper, TV as CNN, New York Times , Websites complaints , Consulate, or whatever is necessary, but I will not leave this matter aside ... at all costsWe are really disappointed with SIX FLAGs, even I sending a lot of emails and registering at Six Flags Complaints, they had not reply nothing until today, I really would like to get a help, as per the Legal department, Lawyers , Justice , I have to resolved it, Brazilian community can not accept it, I´ll spend so many time to get our rights repairedRegardsFlavio",flavionannifilho
20,Awesome rides but ticketing & passes very poor,"I visited Six Flags today and I originally bought a Platinum Flash Pass and 1-Day dining pass. Both of these passes were not worth the money at all.Firstly the Flash Pass was not needed as the park was not particularly busy so I could've gone on rides with slightly more wait time and not have to spend a fortune. They should not be selling this Pass to use at this time when park management would know it is not needed.Secondly, I purchased the dining Pass beforehand and was disappointed with that as not every restaurant accepts it and it was extremely difficult finding an open food place for dinner even with 1 hour left of the park opening. The employees at the food shops also did not know how the dining Pass worked.Ultimately I was disappointed spending so much money on tickets & passes that were clearly a waste of money. I would recommend people research heavily the time that they're going before buying any of these add ons.I'm giving two stars just for the roller coasters as they were great fun.",CraigBN
40,Great for thrill rides,Visited in mid September 2017 and the place was practically empty - no queues! Rides vary from old rickety wooden coasters to newer (taller) hyper coasters and some interesting ones in between.The proportion of proper thrill rides is larger here than somewhere more family oriented like Universal. So hardcore thrill seekers should be satisfied with the choice. Also recommend the rock 'n' roll crab sushi if you're eating at the park. It's delish.,helen261
10,Not a Safe Environment (No Parking Lot Security),"For being a large company with as many guests per day that they do, I am shocked that they don't take guest safety seriously. There is no security in the parking lot. They also make it almost impossible to make a complaint, not only do they do nothing about complaints but they also act like you are an inconvenience. They also claim no managers are ever available. I do not recommend anyone that values their safety and the safety of their family to visit SFMM. Note: I am not referencing ride safety, I am referencing personal safety from other guests on their property.",lori a
50,Another great day at Six Flags Magic Mountain,One of my favorite places to go and hang out and have fun and reasonably priced with more big roller coasters than any other park around,mcdaniel661
50,Thrilling,"We only went for like 3 hours in the evening, because we had the go passes, so the lines were very short. We did most of the most thrilling rides and let me say that they indeed are very thrilling, a little scary at some time, but worth it. We had a great time!!",Isabel S
40,Excellent for six flags,"This area is rural and there is very little around to do but six flags is a 5 minute drive from this location which is excellent if that is why you are visiting, great areas for feeding but that is all. The hotel is excellent and great value for money, well furnished and comfortable sleeping.",GerardPT93
50,Rollercoaster Heaven,"This may be a bold statement but i can honestly, genuinely say that Six Flags Magic Mountain is THE greatest theme park i have ever been to. I travel the world for at least 4 or 5 weeks a year visiting theme parks and riding roller coasters and Magic Mountain has been on my bucket list for a long time. Unlike other bucket list parks like Cedar point, Magic Mountain more than lived up to the hype. I was supposed to go once, i ended up going 3 times because it is really that good. The roller coasters are amazing, there is something for everyone and the rides are all different with each offering a different experience or sensation. I have ridden over 250 roller coasters around the globe and at least 2 (possibly 3) of the rides here make my top 20. Twisted Colossus and Full Throttle are among the best rides I've ever been on and i genuinely had a heavy heart as i left the park for the final time. If you get chance to go, do it, you will not be disappointed",Gavin M
40,"Great rides, expensive food and slow staff","The tag line says it all, if you love rollercoasters then this is the park for you. The thrill rides are out of this world.However, the staff are slow it took us an hour to pick up our tickets to get into the park after spending half an hour in the wrong queue. Then another half an hour stood in the queue where there was only one member of staff.Furthermore you can't take any food and drink into the park at all and the park charged a lot of money $15 for a slice of pizza and a drink.Would still go again just be prepared the the food is expensive but the merchandise is more reasonably priced than other theme parks I've been to.",Amber T
50,Went in late August - did not queue once,"We went on a monday. The park was dead in terms of visitors. It was great.We got there at 10:30 and left at 4pm. We went on all the rides bar 3 as our day was cut short sue to rain and lightning.The park has some brilliant rides. Water rides don't appear to get you as wet as you do in the UK. Thats my only observation which is a negative, if you call it negative.Some of the rides are the best rides I've ever been on. Much bigger and faster than the UK.If you like rides, go here.Food is a little expensive, so bear that in mind. Drinks wise, I'd buy the all you can drink package on line before attending.",Jon Barnsley

30,Roller. Coaster heaven,If you like roller coasters this is the place for youThere is nothing else really here other than roller coaster after roller coasterThe heat was intense on my visit 106 degrees luckily the park was quite so we didn't have to queue otherwise you would have collapsed in the heat as after 15 min wait time there was no shadeI also think the parking at $25 dollars was really expensive especially as we had paid $85 per person to visit the parkWould only visit if you are a avid roller coaster fan we took an elderly gran and there was nothing to do for herBetter bet would be universal,Tara J
30,Does Season Passes flash deal worth it for 1 visit ?,"Does Season Passes flash deal worth it for 1 visit ?I saw the offert for 80 USD maybe it worth even for one single visit (1p) because parking fees are offered, if anyone join maybe a regular ticket is better.

50,Amazing day......very low attendance day,"Family of 5 who enjoy roller coasters had a fantastic day at Six flags!I pre booked tickets online for $59 saving $20 per person and paid upfront for parking. Tickets were for a period of time so we retained flexibility even though travelling from the UK.In the entrance queue (line) I spoke to a local asking what rides are best to start with who advised that the park would be a ""ghost town today"". The park, I guesstimate was 10-20% full and therefore we did not queue for any ride all day 😀 except when we tried to ride X2 which was working on/off all day and was the one ride we did not end up riding. We visited on a Thursday at the end of August.Favourite rides, Goliath, Full Throttle, superman and Twisted colossus.",whatsitallaboutalfie

40,"Blew me Away, all the way from the U.K","This park was outstanding. It's my second visit to a Six Flags park and this one really excelled itself, better than Six Flags Great Adventure, the only other Six Flags park I have visited after this one. Loved the collection of coasters. The staff seemed decent. Park was clean and lots of food options and gift shops for all tastes.Fortunately I found water fountains by most restrooms so a tip is to bring in an empty water bottle(since you cannot bring in your own food or drink) and fill it up throughout day, necessary as you will be walking a lot and in the heat it's crucial to keep hydrated, saves 4-5 bucks. I enjoyed the sandwiches by Twisted Colossus- my favourite roller coaster.They have a Cold stone for cold shakes smoothies and ice creams. Prices what you expect, but I found $20 (a meal, decent portion size and ice cream/shake/smoothie) was enough to keep me full and hydrated (- helped with the water fountains) all day.Now for the consThe wooden coaster, Apocalypse was down which was a small shame but plenty of rides to turn attention to.I did not enjoy all of the rides but there is such a huge range.Do not recommend; Jet stream, quite uncomfortable to ride as is Viper and Green lantern,but that was my personal experience.No virtual reality glasses on New Revolution available/ready so that defeated the point, I assume there has been issues with this aspect/dimension.I am personally not keen on the super heroes aspect/theming and feel Six Flags is losing touch with its original branding but I suspect that's the idea, it was hard to find any original Six Flag logo merchandise in the gift shops. I think the superheroes aspect is an attempt at theming and mainstream appeal. But the general quality of the rides speak for themselves.Ride operations were good on all rides.I particularly recommend Tatsu front row, a must for a flying coaster of this magnitude!The park is massive and well laid out, with the palm trees and mountains it's quite aesthetic in parts. I got pretty tired of walking around so recommend the helpful honda express which will take you up and down the park.Queues were reasonable and I am glad I visited at the time I did- Aug 20-22nd. I was there 3 days in a row because I am a bit hardcore like that, but 2 days would have been adequate.Season passes are incredible value when visiting for any more than 1 day in a season.",Luka D
50,Awesome park,We very enjoyed this park. A lot of roller coaster. You have to buy the flash pass if you want to do all the facilities.,Lior
50,Best park hands down,"Born and raised in Santa Clarita, However i am not being biased i have been to over 20 amusement parks and I must say Sx Flags Magic Mountain is the best one ever, the rollercoasters are suitable for everyone the kids park is great for the little ones, And if you go at night you will have amazing views of the cities, GO GO GO GO you won't be disappointed, but come early or go multiple days to much to cover in just one after noon",Mrtravelbee
50,A brilliant destination for thrills,A day at Magic Mountain is sure to leave you with a fantastic memory!With the world record for the most number of roller coasters in the one park there is literally a ride for every thrillers taste!We managed to get there on a Monday when school was in so the lines were short!

40,Great rides,There's a reason they call it the thrill capital of the world. The extreme rides are awesome and a lot of fun. The bad things were that the wifi sucked and on the ride Tidal Wave the line never moved because they only had one boat that took between 5-10 minutes to do a run through.,Alessandro Vazzaz
50,Great day at Six Flags Magic Mountain!,"Our family of 6 (kids age 11-17) had a great day at Six Flags. We used Is It Packed web site to pick a good day to visit while in S. California and it was accurate. Amazing how many different roller coasters they had to experience from sit, stand, recline. I can't imagine being there on a packed day, the lines would be difficult to bear, but the longest waits were 20 minutes (only a couple of times) with many rides being walk-ons throughout the day.",Damian D
50,Low budget visit,"Is it possible to enjoy Six Flags with low budget?It is.Book your ticket in advance and save up to 20$.Parking is 25$, but you can park your car in McBean Regional Transit Center and take bus 3 or 7 for 1$ (have a change with you).Food is overpriced, two ways are possible: 1. Prepare something in advance and hide it in front of the entrance. You can leave the park and come back without an issue.2. We bought fish and chips for 15$ inside. Quality of food was less than average but if you buy three pieces instead of two, it's a full lunch for two persons (note: We are slim couple from Europe, we are not used to huge portions here in US)There are water fountains at every restroom (at least four of them). If you don't need to drink soda, you can fill your bottles (which you bring with you in backpack) without any issue and don't spend 4$ for one cup of soda.In the end, you can spend just 62$ for a day visit and still enjoy all amazing thrill rides which this park offers.

40,"Rides are great, Flash Pass helps, but the park needs some TLC.","We decided to take a day to go to Six Flags since school was starting the next week. We booked our tickets 3 days in advance and had a discount as well so we saved 30%. We also decided to spend the extra money for the Flash Pass Gold, as we were not sure how crowded the park would be and since we were only going once we didn’t want to wait in long lines. However, the park was not crowded when we went, helped by the fact we went on a Thursday and LA schools had started the week before we went. The longest wait time without Flash Pass was 40 mins for X2. The rides were all great fun and terrifying at the same time. Tatsu, X2, Full Throttle and Twisted Colossus being the ones most thrilling. The Flash Pass was great but not sure when we went it was worth it, if it had been a busy mid-summer day then yes.As far as the Park goes it really needs some TLC, many buildings, railings and rides need to be cleaned and or painted, most looked like they had not been since we were there 20 years ago. Waiting in line for X2 there was a lot of trash down below the lines that looked like no one had picked it up in years, you could see overflowing dumpsters not far from the ride. The plants in the planters entering the park were brown and dying. Never saw anyone going around picking up trash or making an effort to clean anything.Overall it was really fun, but if you expect a Disneyland clean and polish you will be disappointed.",Swede9
40,Incredible rollercoasters!,"If you are looking for a big thrill this is the place to come! Rollercoasters like I have never experienced before. Queuing wasn't so bad, although could reach up to an hour for some of the more popular rides.Unfortunately we did arrive later than we had hoped to the park which meant we had to be very selective with choice of rollercoaster but we still all managed to enjoy it. The younger of the two children was too small for many of the bigger rides but still plenty there to entertain- we split off into groups so everyone could enjoy what they wanted.Only negative to the park was the process for getting in. We had an LA go card and after queuing at the front gate were directed to a gate past security. We got into this queue for 45mins (although only 3 people in front!!) it didn't move and not enough staff on the windows. Seems they team up the queue for la go passes with the annual passes which take much longer to process- if you have one of these cards then arrive earlier to make the most of the day- other than this slight issue it is definitely worth the visit!",Anna P
50,Don't get the complaining,"We arrived at 10.30 and left at 5.30. We experienced ever rollercoaster, the longest wait was Lex which was only 20 minutes. The various coasters are amazing so much better than England. X2, Tatsu, colossus, full throttle & Lex were amazing. My 9 & 11 year old's absolutely loved the experience. Best park we've experienced. Well done LA. Well done USA.",MIKE H
40,Good Times!,"Took my boys to the park and because the local kids went back to school we had virtually NO wait for rides midweek ! So we had a reasonably Good Time. Went on Superman 5 TIMES IN A ROW! Heck yea! All rides were wide open and the weather was mild!!!Now for the Bad News and B.S.Glad we didn't have to BUY that ridiculously stupid FLASH PASS that cost a small fortune. The tickets are expensive enough then if the park is crowded that have a SCAM to go ahead of the line if you pay a Large FEE with 3 Different options ???? What a VERY STRANGE Marketing Idea!!!We travel from a distance away and need to stay at a hotel that cost money. If we need to buy a FLASH PASS along with $25.00 Parking (What the Heck) and then forced to purchase Terrible food a Dried out Hot Dog, Hamburger or 3 Crappy Chx Tenders for $10.99 -12.99 with stale fry's. Magic Mountain becomes a LOSS and disappointing vacation option!The Park is OLD and SOME rides are closed. Then there are a couple of rides like Go Karts and a Sky Swing you have to pay Extra $$ for. What is that B.S.?Anyway overall NOT a G8 value! If you add up all the a family of 4 with all the fees, charges & 1 one lunch and a couple of drinks it can cost $126.00 per person for a day!And you have to wait for rides when crowded the Value is NOT worth going.Fortunately we bought a discount Multi Park pass and a discounted Food Plan last year so it was an OK value. I feel sorry for the family that travels there for the 1 day it is a Bad value!Hope you found this review helpful.Note Hurricane Harbor food is hit and miss we had to ask them on 3 occasions for Fresh fry's and Burgers.Good Luck with your visit!",China Bob
40,So much fun Love the thrill rides,"I have been to Six Flags in Vallejo, CA and they did not have a lot of thrill roller coaster.. Valencia Six Flags is huge with LOT's of Thrill rides. We did not wait in line for more than 30 min which is great considering we went on a Sat. Highly recommend getting the dinning pass: you get a souvenir cup with unlimited refills all day, lunch, snack and dinner it is a good deal and saves money.BIGGEST Recommendation: GET a Locker at the start of the day or it is $1.00 each roller coaster",Jessica M
50,Always Fun,Always love going to the mountain. Been going since a kid. Now I bring my family and we have a great time.,David D
50,Incredible,"The best theme park we have ever experienced!It's like all the rides have been super sized .If you like thrills then this park is for you.Massive drops, loop de loops , standing, laying , sitting rollercoasters .Kids need to be 48 inches for some roller coasters and 54 inches for the insane rollercoasters .It needs a whole day there to ensure u do every ride!!!Fantastic",Stuart W
20,Few good rides but mostly dissapointed,"I am not sure how paying so much money to enter a facility means that once in you have to pay even more to go on a ride? Also, rides were not available as well as most of the out dated booths around the park. I could not believe that I had to pay $5 for a bottle of water and i saw one water fountain which was located out in the sun and was not working. As for the rides, most were exciting apart from the '4d' ride which did not even give us head sets and had no advertising that it was not available.If you have an extra $400 laying around that you dont mind using then it can be an amusing day out - but dont expect to get what you pay for.",Dearnshaw
40,thrill ride,"if roller coasters are your thing..you have arrived.put on your big boy pants because this might test your man card.while long lines may sometimes rattle your good nature,this adrenaline park rivals any of its kind west of the mississippi.",rossgibson1
50,Brilliant rides,This park is amazing for the thrill seekers looking to go on daring rides. For most of the rides that I went on there was no queue and I was straight on the rollercoaster. Very good theme park overall and worth paying a visit to.,oscar05
50,Summer Trip August 2017,"Visited with our TX Season Passes -- best deal was snack at Cold Stone Creamy. Rides were thrill rides - twists & turns. Lots of good roller coasters. We did get stuck on a ride & the staff did not offer any fast passes to compensate us for our time. Additionally, we informed staff of line cutters & nothing was done. All photos downloaded onto our photo pass require us to pay $14.99 for downloads.",TXTraveller1974
50,A-amazing EVERY TIME!!,What could possibly be bad to be said about 6 flags!!! Have a blast every time we're here. We get really lucky when we're here...never have to wait long to get o rides except this time for 1 ride...the Tidal Wave...don't bother. Super short ride that you're supposed to get soaked on. We didn't get 1 drop of water on us. Got in and long wait. Go stand on the bridge at the exit and you'll get soaked there instead to cool off. Otherwise the park is a MUST for anyone that has never been!!!,Birdiej29
30,Deals for eating at Six Flags,"You are not allowed to bring any food into Six Flags which I think is wrong. Besides the cost of the pass, parking is $25 and since you'll be there all day you have no choice but to purchase food. We found the pizza deal good as we had two teenage boys with us. The pizza is made fresh and service was fast. Best bang for your buck.",ljd4
40,Fun but too hot,"I love the rides here. This is the place if you seek thrill rides. However, the wait times are long and ridiculous especially for the water rides. If you go on a hot day expect the wait time for the water ride to be 120 minutes!! So lame.I ordered a turkey leg and it was delicious. My bf got a chicken sandwich with kettle cooked chips. He didn't like his sandwich because it was too dry. The chips were old and tasted like it was burnt meaning that they probably didnt change the oil from the previous day.Most importantly, couples do not get scam from this hotel company that promises free travel gifts ;)",danie_elephant7
30,OUTDATED,There is a massive lack of air conditioning and choices of food. It advertises Coke free machines yet only has 2 in the same place at the start of the park. It takes forever to get there as LA has extreme traffic. This park is mainly filled with rollercoaster 15 to be precise its outdated and needs updating. There is although a brilliant kiddie park for 3-7.,AmelieRule
50,Outstanding day out,Take Dramamine if you have a nervous disposition. We got a Flash Pass and managed to get on over 20 serious rides a day. Place was busy but did not seem overcrowded. Our favourite them park in the states by far.,familywatts2015
50,The roller coaster parks of champions,"We visited on a Friday and I think other than a 2 hour queue for the Samsung VR coaster all other queues were less than 30 minutes.We actually had platinum passes but we could have not bothered, that said it was 105f so anything that made it smoother was good.This is a hard core coaster park that pays only lip service to other rides. The park has 15+ coasters, I have to give it 5 stars for that alone. I don't know why they bother to license the DC comic stuff, they really don't do it very well and are very poor in comparison to Universal or Disney.The food outlets were a bit old and tatty. In fact the whole park is a bit tired, people not riding struggled to find shade or descent wait seating.BUT this is a coaster park, this is hard core coaster heaven, by the end of the day we had ridden so many coasters that they blended in to each other.There is a small kiddy ride park located near the entrance and my five year old enjoyed it, but she had to wait all day to get there.",Christian R
30,"Good rides, grotty park.","We went to six flags a few years back. The ticket prices were extortionate but we couldn't resist! We had the platinum flash pass which was very good. However, X2 is and extra charge on top of the pass itself which I feel is ridiculous considering the amount of money already spent. The rides are ok! Viper and apocalypse were dreadful although apocalypse has been re-tracked so it's probably better! We went on the new twisted colossus which was outstanding! As was full throttle! However, I count help but feel the park was tired and grotty! The rides were not up to the quality of those that I have ridden at universal or any of our theme parks in the U.K. The area of the park by viper was also very worn down so maybe some work on this wouldn't go a miss. Considering the ticket prices, I thought they could've cleaned it up a bit. We did have a good day but the quality let's this park down. The rides that are good are really fantastic and I would recommend the park but the rides that aren't are about as bad as rides can get! I'd love to return but I'd hope for some TLC on park appearance!",teenagetraveller09
50,Six Flags MM - It doesn't get better,Another thrilling visit at Six Flags MM. This time my two boys 12 and 14 came with me. They were unstoppable. This is the absolute best roller coaster park that you can go to. The rides are world class - some are scary as hell and the rest are even worse/better. Just the way they have to be. The Security level is high and the staff is helpfull. This park is worth the travel no matter where you start.,Michael-OA-DK
10,rubbish,The price of the food and drink is ridiculous and u can't bring in any of your own. The only vegetarian option was chips or onion rings which was a massive issue for me as I found it extremely difficult to eat. I went on the ride called x2 and smacked my head on the seat meaning i had a headache for the rest of the day!,Ella J
30,Its fun on weekdays when kids are at school,Rides are nice and fun for the first experience.X-2 probably my favorite because of the thrill.Customer service is horrid though excluding people near the admission gates.Food is expensive as ever but who can I blame.Itll be hot so bring some sun lotion and bottles of water.,Shong B
30,"Amazing Coasters, Mediocre Park","Let me start off by saying that the roller coasters in this park are fantastic. If you are a teen or older and you don't come here for the coasters, then why are you even here at all? The coasters make this park come on top, but not as a park itself. There are so many problems with this park outside of the roller coasters that extra preparation is definitely recommended.First off, this park is huge, but not only is it huge, but it is also very hot and a lot of the park is placed right on the slopes of a large hill. This wouldn't be so bad if there would be a much better convenience with shade and misters, so before you enter the park, make sure you have a plastic water bottle so you can refill all day long without having to worry about paying for a regular or souvenir cup.Secondly, this park feels pretty ghetto, even without the crowd of LA teens. An amusement park should feel like another world, but many places in the park felt cheap, dirty, unkempt, etc.Finally, the food. I've been to dozens of amusement parks across the country, but this park is definitely in the bottom 3 when it comes to food. They normally serve the food either cold, stale, undercooked, or just bad.Overall, I recommend this as a coaster-only park as the roller coasters (and some other rides) are absolutely the only reason to keep coming back.(Note: Ride Twisted Colossus. It's one of the best roller coasters out there)",RiderReak
40,Great theme park for a nice price.,"By far, I can appreciate a theme park that does not cost over $100. There should not be an amusement park that cost so much. Thank God for magic Mountain. Our students had fun and a great time. Now we had some problems with the picnic lunch, but other than that it was a nice place.",Djones159
50,Family Friendly Fun,"I'm a Southern California resident and have been to the park many times. Magic Mountain was cleaner than I've ever seen it, the staff was more professional and friendly than ever, and the lines were wonderfully short!!! We fit 2 days of fun into our one day trip and it was fun for all of us from ages 10- 43. The 10 year old was tall enough for all the rides and we all enjoyed the thrills and fun.",Kim V
30,Great theme park. Just not for me,"We visited on a Sunday and it was not crowded at all. Food was super overpriced, even for a theme park. It seems like a fun place for a thrill seeker, but I wouldn't visit again.",jessee04
50,The best theme park I have visited ever!,"Needed a fun get away for my 13 year old. We have done Disneyland, Disneyworld, etc. etc. He has been bugging me to go to Six Flags for the last couple of years so I finally gave in. OMG! Sooooo awesome. This park has the best thrill rides ever! We stayed at the Hampton Inn Santa Clarita (also recommend) so were only a couple minutes away. Now one guilty admission. We did get the platinum ""Flash Pass"". Yes it is expensive as hell. Was it worth it? Every penny! There are three different levels of flash passes but we went for the best one. The longest wait we had was 8 minutes. Most rides were instantaneous entrance. Because of this we were able to hit every main ride we wanted and even some bonus smaller ones with no problem. We loved all the rides. X2 was our fave and is truly worth the visit in and of itself. We had no issues anywhere, staff members were helpful and friendly and grounds are clean and well kept. Trust me, if you have to choose a theme park to go to and you like roller coasters and great fun rides go here. We will definitely be going back. Enjoy!",Yenom99
40,"Six Flags Magic Mountain (rides, flash pass, heat, noise)","Six Flags Magic Mountain is a brilliant place to go to if you love all kinds of rides, in particular thrill rides, such as roller coasters, its main attraction. Six Flags offers so many rollercoasters, all cool, scary or unique in their own way. My favorite rollercoasters were Tatsu and Superman: Escape from Krypton. Tatsu is the longest and tallest ""flying"" rollercoaster in the world. Whilst riding it, I literally believed that I was flying through the air. I loved Superman because the ride was so fast and the acceleration was just unbelievable: On Superman, you accelerate from 0-100mph in only seven seconds!Other than the awesome rides, something else worth mentioning, is the flash pass. When my father, sister and I last went to Magic Mountain, we had flash passes. And honestly, we didn't regret purchasing them, even if we spent more money. They can make your visit at Six Flags much more exciting, especially when the park is crowded with loads of people! Thanks to the flash passes, we could ride 10 rollercoasters in a couple hours, and waited much less than most people did.On the other hand, what I disliked the most was the heat. In the theme park, the temperature was really high, about 90F (35°) and we always had stop to take a break in between and drink lots of water. Another minus: the volume of noise was quite loud and can give you a headache after a while. Although, that's not such a big deal, I guess that belongs to a theme park, and if it bothers you, I would recommend bringing with ear plugs...",Sophia T
50,My throat hurts ...,"... because of all the shouting. There are nearly 19 roller coasters. Yes. 19! And all of them unique in their own way.Tatsu, Batman, Twisted Colossus, each and every one of those rides is just amazing. You'll feel thrill like never before. Also, expect the unexpected since each ride isn't just linear.Tips:Would recommend coming in early in the morning (right when the park opens) with an empty stomach and starting from the end. Also, make use of single rider lines to sail through easily. Also, buy the whole day soft drink package. It's really hot out there. Go for mex food, really cheap and filling. Try completing all the main rides before lunch. This would help you make the most out of your visit.",Ranveer A
50,The best rides ever,"if you like roller coasters, that is your place. Lots of rides, one better than the other. I spent one of the best days of my life. Almost cried when I saw the Hall of Justice (from DC attractions). You can´t miss the Super man, Green lantern and X2 attarctions! They are insane!",Lilian_dreis
40,Brilliant but needs more shade,Six flags is NOT for the faint hearted. The roller coasters are BIG and frantic. If you don't like roller coasters don't go. If you love them then six flags is for you.Fast passes are too expending. About $350 for a family of four (including two teens) but fast passes (available in the park) cost about the same for gold fast passes.July is HOT HOT HOT and the park needs MORE shade and rest spots.Great fun!,AudaciousOne
50,"Adrenaline boost on rides (excellent).....skip the food though, expensive and very very bad","This park is purely and adrenaline boost, so if you like quick, fast and scary rides this is where you should go. In that sense, it beats Disneyland 100%. They also provide a fast pass system, which is rather expensive but we opted for it. In hindsight we probably would have gotten the same amount of pleasure without the fast pass, it's very convenient though and you never know how busy it's going to be.One note, the food in this park is horrible. So I suggest you enter the park with a full tummy (not too full so that you will get sick on the rides) and maybe live on soft drinks the entire day, they have a cup that you buy once and you can have unlimited refills. Burgers are very very bad, expensive and without taste. If you are really too hungry, probably chicken fingers are your best bet.Again, rides are awesome, it appears as some of the surroundings of the rides lack some maintenance, however the rides themselves look all very well in order.",ThomasEMM
30,Great for teenagers,It is no doubt the place for crazy rides and thrill. Very hot(not enough shaded place) and noisy(music blast at every corner). Long queue for food and drinks. Not enough healthy diet options.,MinibearX
50,The best park in the world,You must arrive early because in the summer the park is crowded. The cooler rides have long lines so you should buy the platinum pass which will save you a couple of hours. If you are mad about roller coasters like me this pass is needed. Me and my family were able to go to all the roller coasters we wanted thanks to this wonderful pass. It's a little bit pricey but totally worth it.,Patricia L
50,Fun ! Fun!,Great Family Park ! Rides for the adults and kidsGreat Restaurants and Customer ServiceClean and a lot of areas to rest,J915XJmarias
40,Did not need the fast passes,"We spent a fortune getting the fast passes that cue queueing down by 90% however we didn't them. There wasn't many queues at all. Even X2 didn't have a queue longer than an hour.The park is very hot. We're English so we struggle with the heat anyway but coming to six flags after disney and universal we found it to be so so hot. There was shade if you wasn't on a ride e.g the benches but the queues etc were stifling.The rides are huge and lots of them go upside down. Some of the biggest rides I have ever ever done.We got the $16 refill drink which really really came in handy.The $25 photo pass was very good, lots of rides offered photos.We found one resteraunt (the sports bar) that had air con and my goodness we needed it!I wouldn't return but I am sure glad we have done it.",Chloe Cos
50,"Great weather, fun rides","Day 1 of our trip. Quick lines, averaged about 40 minutes. Hot day so everyone was at the hurricane harbor. Got on the goliath, full throttle, twisted something or other don't remember, roaring rapids, scream, X2, and apocalypse, and they were all awesome. Price for both of us was 95.00 with special tickets. So keep a look out.",Felix C
40,Excellent roller coasters but not very clean park,"For thrill seekers, this park is a dream come true - lots of roller coasters, many of which I have never experienced before! Lots of innovative rides and definitely well worth a visit. The fastpass service is definitely good value too - even on quieter days, I believe you would get value and we found it extremely beneficial and we bought the cheapest option at $50 per person. I wouldn't recommend buying a photo pass - there are few rides that actually take photos and there are no photographers around the park itself to take photos. The main negative point I would make is the standard of cleanliness. The toilets were extremely dirty and smelly - even early in the morning when the park first opened. I was surprised by this as every other theme park I've been to in the USA has always had very high standards of cleanliness. We even saw a staff member attempting to clean the toilet floor area, with water only - no evidence of cleaning fluid - and all that happened was dirty water just go spread around even more! There is no wifi in the park either which was disappointing and the water fountains were not shaded, meaning hot water was coming out of the fountains rather than cold. Six Flags could learn a lot from Disney in terms of cleanliness and shading the water fountains! Overall a good day out.",Sc0ttishSunseeker
50,Fantastic park - read the negative reviews at your peril!,"I was dreading our day at Six Flags 40C (100F) forecast, just after 4th July long weekend and the negative reviews ingrained in me about wait times, heat, etc. We had a brilliant day. Firstly, I'm not sure if people are planning on taking in picnics or coolers but we took our own water in and refilled at the many drinking fountains around the park. It's huge, there is plenty of shady spots and misters and we may have got lucky but the crowds weren't as crazy as I had expected. We brought the fast passes which of course helped but it pains me to say it but we may not have needed them. Sure for the super popular ride we felt like celebs cruising past everyone to hop on the next ride but the queues weren't that long that we walked past! There was plenty of food options, the rides of course were fantastic and the park itself was nicely laid out. We had been tossing up between visiting Universal Studios and Six Flags and bang for buck, our day here won by a mile. We stayed in Santa Clarita $132USD for night (compared with the $600 USD for same hotel chain in Santa Monica if going to Universal studios) , our tickets were almost half the price of Universal Studios and the rides sounded like they were so much better. I swear we saved about $1500USD by choosing this theme park. And we got to see another part of California. So ignore the doubters, go prepared for a long, hot day, but it's all doable and instead of having a stressful day as I'd expected, we ended up having a blast!",Boyos
50,Very little wait compared to other parks,"So far my boyfriend and I have gone to Six Flags New England (Massachusetts), Great Adventure (New Jersey) and America (Maryland). We plan to go to Six Flags Over Georgia and La Ronde in Canada this year as well. We pay for memberships - his includes parking which is one less out of pocket expense every time we go to any park in the USA.This Six Flags had amazing coasters but minimal wait times compared to other parks. My favorite rides were X2 and Twisted Colossus. Those 2 were unlike any other rides I've been on.Batman The Ride here at Magic Mountain looks like the ones in New England and New Jersey but is more exciting and unexpected that those are. Also, Green Lantern First Flight is exactly like The Joker in NJ. We didn't get to go on The Riddler's Revenge since the line was always 2 hours long when we were there but it appeared to be a stand up coaster similar to Green Lantern in NJ so we didn't feel like we missed out. Justice League: Battle for Metropolis was having problems and closed both days we were at Magic Mountain but we received an email from Six Flags the day after we left the area apologizing for the closure and promising exclusive ride time loaded to our membership cards. If we were still around we would have taken advantage but we had plans to leave on the day they promised ride time.The 20-40 minute wait times were really pleasant to stand in. During the day I wish they sprayed mist above the lines like they do in the east coast parks or used fans in areas like the MA and NJ parks do to keep those in line cool but other than that no complaints. Really nice clean park! Also - I appreciated the dual language ride explanations in English and Spanish. None of the other parks we've been to have that.",Jacqueline J
30,Don't ride X2! The line is not worth it,"We made the terrible mistake of getting into line for X2 as one of the first things we did. Really wish we had done our research. The lineup said estimated wait time, 30 mins. We walked into a seemingly short line as it didn't really start until well past that sign. We figured 20 mins, worst case. 2 1/2 hours later....And X2... It's violent. That's the only way to describe it. We went for big thrills, big coasters, G-forces... All of the above. But X2 is a different beast. Jarring and violent.The rest of the coasters were as advertised. Our favorites were Tatsu, Goliath, Batman, and Riddler's Revenge. Aside from X2, lineups were almost a non issue. Don't waste money on Flash Pass on a weekday. Just do your homework and avoid the 2-3 with the big lines.",Cobalt G
10,Membership management hung up on me,"In September of 2016 we visited the park and was sold an annual membership. Upon entering the park we soon realized that all rides we wanted to go on were closed due to rain. Mind you that we planned this trip in advance met people there from distances as far as 6 hours away. Went to guest relations and told them we were leaving the park due to ride closure and inability to use membership. Requested refund and was told to contact technical support management at 321-249-0110 because we were under contract. We had no choice but to leave, no one was able to help, I followed up with an email, a letter, and several phone calls. I've been told that I could have visited on other days and that the membership is valid. Ironic that a company in the business of enjoyment and amusement has no regard for customer satisfaction nor the fact that I requested an immediate refund. It is July 2017 and my PayPal account is still being charged a monthly fee, so dissatisfied that I refuse to visit. It has been unresolved and huge frustration.",Tom N

50,One of the best of the Six Flags parks,"SFMM has some of the best coasters on this planet - period. Unlike the other parks the rides are mostly not clones, but original rides specific to the park. It is also a rather pretty park and nice to visit. Be warned - as the name implies, there is a mountain so visiting some of the rides requires a bit of a climb. There is a funicular that can transport you back and forth.",joemess44
50,Friends Trip,"Not sure what it's like other days but we had a perfect day in the park. There was almost no lines for the rides and all the rides were open. We were able to get on everything. The extreme were just that, EXTREME. The thrills were memorable. It was extremely hot that day so we were greatful for the food and beverage locations around almost every corner. We ate at the sports bar. The service and food were both really good. We were just as excited about the air conditioner in the sports bar lol. I'm currently planning another trip to the park before the summer is over. Good times.",amorgan32
40,Excellent rides but...,"This is a really great Six Flags park and they have really high thrills rides but the park itself lack of something. Difficult to say, is it the way the configuration of the park is... Not sure, but they defenetly have some pretty high octane rides :)",Denis B.
50,Worth every penny!,"I can honestly say that if you like rollercoasters you will be in heaven. I do suggest purchasing the refillable cups that were always welcomed at the different concession stands. The sushi was amazing but I don't suggest having a spicy chicken Chinese lunch before a day of high speed loop, dip, twist, drop, and roll fun.",Tiffany E
50,"My favorite amusement park, hands-down!","I've reviewed this park before, but I wanted to do so again since I visited for three days instead of one during this trip and got to ride several other rides. I was visiting while being in Los Angeles for a book signing and was so impressed when I'd been in town two years before that I planned to definitely spend more time there.I am a huge coaster nut and rode almost every coaster during this more recent visit. I purchased a membership, which is a low monthly payment that allows the holder to visit the other Six Flags parks. Very good value.My body gave out before I could come close to riding everything last time, so I planned three days of shorter visits. I went on a Wed., Thur. and Mon., with the last visit being on July 3rd. They had a promotion where passholders could bring a Coke product and ride certain coasters early. That was really nice. I got to ride Twisted Colossus twice in a row with practically no line. But the lines weren't horrible. I believe I visited on a Sunday in October the last time and the lines were far longer then.I rode X-2 during that previous visit, but that was enough for me. It's pretty much the only coaster I really don't want to get on again, but other thrill seekers might love it.The ride that scared me the most this time was Green Lantern First Flight. It was fun, but not like a usual coaster. It's kind of like a ribbon folded on top of itself and it does bounce around and toss the rider around (the seat does spin completely around). I was a little intimidated but I was glad I did ride. Make sure you're secured tight because it threw me forward hard and I felt kind of wedged in the tiny bit of space left. That final spin when it drops the last time is an extreme feeling.I rode Tatsu twice--one of my favorite coasters ever. You life face down, and once you get over the fear of that harness opening up, it's like flying. The G-force in the big reverse loop (I say reverse since riders face the opposite direction) are like nothing else I've ever experienced. I did get to ride it before and was anxious to ride again.Scream wasn't running the last time I was there, but this time I rode it four times. It's a long coaster with a lot of surprises...just a lot of fun.Twisted Colossus is my favorite coaster in the world (tied with Canada Wonderland's Leviathan) and I think I rode that five times. I'd also ridden it previously and was dying to get on again.I also rode Batman, a suspended coaster, which delivers plenty of thrills, again.Riddler's Revenge wasn't running, which was just a little disappointing.The new coasters I got to ride:Apocalypse - A wooden coaster that was filled with twists and turns. The car even runs through the boarding station over waiting riders' heads. Set up like an escape from the end of the worldNinja - Suspended cars. Reminded me of Vortex at Wonderland. A lot of fun; rode it twice.Superman - Big thrill. Rode this three times. It shoots you backward 100 mph up 450 feet. Short ride, but a big thrillGoliath - A big drop and thrilling twists and turns. A must-ride. Rode twiceI think there was one called Gold Rush. It looked like a kiddie coaster, but definitely was not. It ran along the ground a large part of the way, but the speed and twisting track had my heart racing.Full Throttle - Never been on a coaster quite like this. The loop seems much bigger when you go over the top of it than when you're looking at it from the ground. Riders are shot out of the station through the inside of the loop. You drop around a corner and stop inside a tunnel which then shoots you back halfway up through the drop, and when you come back through the tunnel shoots the coaster super fast over the outside/top of the loop. The coaster brakes very hard coming down the side of the loop into the station. When you experience this ride for the first time, you don't know what to expect and it's quite thrilling.Grand American Carousel - A very nice carousel I really enjoyed riding.The New Revolution Galactic Attack - This coaster was a new experience also. Riders can choose to wear a virtual reality helmet. It has a Samsung phone over the eye area that plays out a galactic scene while the coaster is in motion. I thought it was super well done. Riders could turn their heads in the direction they wanted the coaster to go. It was an experience like I've never had before. I really enjoyed that one.Viper - I believe this is one of the older coasters in the park, so I wasn't too nervous, but this one is no joke. The drop is pretty thrilling and the tight loops deliver an exciting ride. It lasted longer than I expected too. A lot of fun!I really did love this park. The rides are exciting and the merchandise is quality. The have super hero capes in every color (even pinks and purples). I sent my nieces and sister Batman capes and got a Superman shirt and cape for hubby. I found a very cool ""Daddy's Little Monster"" shirt, but beware. The XL sizes are quite tight (I like a loose-fitting tee). Both my Harley Quinn shirts had this problem. The staff throughout was friendly.I didn't eat here a lot, but raised an eyebrow when Coldstone Creamery staff told me ALL the ice cream contained gluten. At another food place right outside Tatsu, they couldn't tell me if the fries were gluten free and I consider it dangerous when food service workers are not provided this information. I wouldn't say this is a safe place for people with a gluten allergy to eat and that is extremely disappointing. I didn't not eat in the park, save for a little ice cream after I'd checked Coldstone's website. There's such a variety of things to do here. I'm already itching to return!",AuthorCMelanson
30,"Awesome Roller coasters, Poor park.","The roller coasters and rides at six flags are great, heaps of fun for my partner and I. However, the rest of the park is lacking. There is no shade for the majority of the queuing, limited access to water, and sprawling concrete. Given the heat of the day this was so poor compared to other parks and desperately needs addressing.",Rupert R
50,Fantastic day,This park has something for everyone. We went for the fast and bigger rides as we have older teenagers.I would suggest visiting on a weekday ...obviously less busy. Buy tickets online in advance it's cheaper. Don't buy a fast pass until you get there and see how busy it is.When the park opens head to the far side and work your way back. Most people will get in line for the rides near the gate.We went on a Friday in July and there were hardly any lines. We had considered buying the fast pass but it was not needed. So glad we didn't.In all a great day . Lots of really big rollercoasters if that's what you're after this is it.There is a water park there as well. I believe you can buy a joint ticket. I didn't go myself.,Monica004
50,Unreal fun,"My husband and I visited May 2017, on a Sunday.We must have got there at the right time, as we never had to wait more than 20 minutes to get on a ride. Later that day wait times were over 45 min but we never had that struggle (except with Full Throttle, but it was worth it).We had so much fun. We loved Goliath, Superman, Batman, and Full Throttle. The other ones were good, but some knocked my head around too much and i got a headache.We had the bonus of visiting with friends from Cali, so they apparently can bring a friend for free every so often, so we didn't have to pay for our tickets. Lunch was good enough, as theme park food is. Expensive and greasy. But overall this was the best theme park visit i've ever had. I can't wait to go to more Six Flags!",Tatijana P
50,Good Value,"I went on a hot Friday in June with my teenage sons. The crowds and the lines/queues weren't too bad, even though the car park was mostly full when we arrived. For a couple of the rides, the waiting time was c40-45 minutes, but most were less than that, and some were as short as 5 minutes. The rides are all terrific, particularly Tatsu and Goliath. There's also an older-looking wooden roller-coaster whose name I have forgotten, and while it doesn't look as spectacular as some of the others, it's every bit as enjoyable. Over the day, we got to go on maybe 11 or 12 of the rides, which meant the entrance fee represented good value. One or two of the rides were closed for maintenance, which was a pity, though to be honest this didn't detract from the overall experience. I'd suggest you try to get there for opening time, in order to park closer to the entrance. Food and drinks are expensive (eat a good breakfast before you go!). Overall, though, this is the best park of its kind that I've ever been to.",PJF100
50,real fun,"we enjoy it very much,they do not allow food inside ... !!!the queues were not so bad.go and enjoy.",Avihay T
50,Greatest roller coasters.,The park has the best collection of roller coasters. There are rides for small children up to those who like to push all limits on roller coasters.,Daniel H
30,Fun but lacks atmosphere,"We purchased a flash pass platinum which was $130 per person plus entry fee which got cheaper by going to Santa Clarita visitors page and clicking the link. About $50 each and parking was $23. So pretty expensive day at over $743 USD. In saying that if u can afford it definitely get the flash pass. We never waited anymore than 2 minutes whilst normal question were minimum 60 minutes per ride. Pretty good ridesI felt it was missing atmosphere, I also noticed not many signs to show where rides where.When we first entered we needed to find the flash pass office and found the entry staff not very helpful but flash pass office was good.",Tania W
50,Super fun,Great rides some of the biggest I have ridden definitely for older kids but super exciting. Make sure to keep your phone in a secure place.,froggy45632
50,Fabulous!! Flash pass is worth it!!,"My teens loved this park! We did purchase ""flash pass"" to go to the front of the line. That was such a great idea and made the day even more enjoyable. There is no way they would have been able to ride all of the rides, without the flash pass. The park was very crowded and it was extremely hot. It is a great park for thrill seekers!",bzymom40
50,Amazing park but not quite as good as Cedar Point,"Being a coaster enthusiast this was a must visit park for years. Its a brilliant park but not quite as good as Cedar Point, Where they both have the quantity Magic mountain lacks the quality. But I had an amazing time over 3 days, the 3rd 4th & 5th of July. 4th of July was dead. I didn't use a fast pass once and I rode every coaster 3 or 4 times. The only thing I bought in the Park was a meal and there was plenty of choice. X2, Tatsu, Superman and Twisted Colossus are the best rides, only thing I didn't like was that the park was very Hilly (i guess the name of the park gives that away.)so by the end of the day my legs were tired from walking up and down, but then you can always get the Orient Express train up the hill. I'f some of the coasters weren't clones of other rides in six flags parks this would be rated the same as Cedar Point in my Honest Opinion.",Brad C
40,Summer vacation,The one thing I suggest is to stay closer than we did because the freeway it is located off of seems to always be busy. When we went the waiting times for rides weren't too bad all in all. Unfortunately it is very warm there this summer. Was around 100 + degrees every day we visited. My son really liked all the rides. He was disappointed because the Riddler was closed off due to them building another ride close to it. Maybe you could have it open during peak months and work on it in the fall/winter when less people are there.,Dana P
50,Great coaster park!,I went here with adult only group. We went on a Friday and surprisingly the park on the rides side was not that crowded. I think it was in part due to the recent heat wave. The X2 was the most intense of the coasters. Drinks and food a little on the pricey side as expected in these parks. Overall the group had a blast and would go again.,Steve L
50,Mom,"Excellent trip, the lines were short, the rides were great and the sandwich by kwerks delicious. The show at kwerks is amazing.",Lilia B
30,Great rides but let's itself down by poor management,"Came here for three days as part of our holiday. The difference between 6 flags and say Disney or Universal is the lack of detail. It's functional. If 6 flags was a room then the curtains would have no tie backs, and there'd be no cushions on the settee!The good points are that if you like rollercoasters this is the place for you. There are 19 making it the largest number in one park in the world and obviously some of them are right up there as great rides. The staff generally we found to be good as well, polite, helpful and on our last day the staff at twisted colossus were doing their best to get the trains going as quickly as possible so that you can duel (i.e. Two of you go round separate tracks at the same time) Another staff member offered us water proof bags for our phones on the roaring rapids which she'd bought herself!Now the bad points. Very little else other than roller coasters. No single riders queue (line) plus the staff seem unwilling or not allowed to organise the people to fill up the empty seats. For example the log flumes can contain 6 people but often just 2 occupied each one even when the queue was up to an hour long. The Flash pass people (pay to jump the queues) go straight to the front of the line and so tend to take the front or back row seats. The park doesn't open until 1030am most days, even in the height of summer. The season pass, whilst better value if you're visiting three or more times runs for a calendar year and not for a year. I.E it expires Dec 31st regardless of when you buy it. They sell a day/season photo pass but most of the rides don't have a photo option on them.Overall, some great coasters, but little else",Xhara71
10,Bad Experience with Customer Services,"I will just post the letter I sent to this company but I never got a response!Dear Sirs, I want to help you improve your quality service with my complaint. Today (May 29th, 2016) I bought two Flash Passes to enjoy my day at your park. In general your service is good. But today, after making a reservation to ride on Ninja at 4:27, I arrived 5 minutes before. The ride was supposed to leave before my due time, I was asked to wait patiently for the next ride. I said ok no Problem. There were other clients complaining that about the lack of information about the rules and so forth. I just waited there. At 4:35 after waiting the other ride of the common clients, I was allowed to get in to sit. In the meantime, your employees (Leslie, Destiney and another lady) were chatting. I supposed they are your representatives who are responsible for guiding customers, right. Here comes the problem, I was sitting on front row but only after everyone was sat on their places, your employees told me I was not allowed to sit on those places. I was sitting there with my son. I was asked to get out to my surprise all seats seemed to be taken. I said that was not proper work and that I wanted to register a complaint. At this moment your employee tried to ignored me and move along side.On my fault I extended my arms and touch her lightly with my arm. Lesley invented that I hold her by the shoulder and all your employees hide behind a lie to call security to removed me from the place. They asked me to wait until security arrived. I waited to explain the event. After talking to security, I was advised to keep my day riding other machines but not the Ninja. I was so upset that I then went to Guest Relations to make a complaint.Your other employee Tracy pretended to hear my case saying that she will record my complaint. When I went back to read the complaint then she said it was not done. Requested my ID to register the complaint but then I said I will just send you ane-mail. I am writing this because your people are just not treating people properly. Good luck with your park which by the way is amazing.",Paulo O
20,Needs Help,"First they are able to change the time that the park opens at their leisure. We looked on line that the park opens at 10am., however, they didn't open until 10:30am. The first two rides we went to ride were closed. This park seems run down. Junky store offerings. While waiting in line for rides in the areas that are off limits to riders; there is trash everywhere. It looks terrible. We have been all over the United States to amusement parks and this is the trashiest/dirtiest park. They need to take time before and after the park closes to clean up the grounds. Also, I have never been to a park where you have to park your vehicle behind the park and walk all the way around the outside to the gate. Very strange. But, there is a shaded tree area with picnic tables where your family can have lunch,a snack or relax for a moment before walking all the way around the park again to go back in.",Barbara B

50,Thrilled,"I really do like this kind of parks! This is one of the best you could find! Very clean, friendly people and many rollercoasters!

50,Great rides an amazing time,"All rides are amazing, even if you are slightly afraid of heights.

10,Don't waste your time!,"We went to six flags in June 12 th, 2017 and it was a complete disaster! As soon as we arrived there we realized that three roller coasters weren't working. And while we were waiting in line two other had broken! In the end of the day we went only in three roller coasters!! They should do something to improve this place! They don't care if you spend your time and money! They don't even apologize for this bad client treatment! So don't go to this place even if you have nothing to do!!!",Marcelotoc
40,"Best rides we've found, needs misters on a hot day","There are so many high speed thrill rides it was hard to get to them all. Watch out for Viper, even the youth said it hurt their necks. Perhaps that's why there was a short line there all day long. It was very hot (96 in June) and misters were almost non-existent, so you have to find a way to keep cool - we kept dousing ourselves with water. We had read that fanny packs were allowed, but most of the rides made us take them off and either pay for a locker or put in a community bin next to the ride, so if you have valuables, you may worry about the community bin. I suggest either wearing pants with zipper pockets (most thrill rides went upside down at least once) or getting the $8 locker option at the rides (not the $12 one at customer relations) which allows for you to use different lockers at each ride, you just have to remember both your 7 digit code and your 4 digit code, which you get to chose. The food & drinks are insanely expensive, but they did allow us to bring in one sealed bottle of water each. We decided to get the $40 flash pass (the cheapest pass option), but be aware there were five popular rides it could not be used on. You use the flash pass device to reserve a spot in line remotely, but can't go to the ride until the allotted wait time is up (so you ride other things while waiting) and you can only reserve one at a time. Overall, it was worth it to be able to skip some lines.",Sage C
40,Great way to spend time with the Grandsons.,"Part of seeing your grandsons is to have a good time. Magic Mountain is the perfect place when In Valencia. I cannot count all the rides that are available. ( Basically mostly thrill type>) There is an area for smaller children. The park has done quite a bit in the past few years to monitor the clients and it seems the issues that plagued the park six years ago are finished. So a wonderful safe day. Did not try toe waterpark portion, a few of the slides look really exciting.",mitch w
10,Lost and Found is a Joke and probably FRAUD involved,"Daughter lost phone. App ""I find my phone"" located iphone7. Went to guest relations and they where not interested in the direct location of the phone at X2 roller coaster, where the phone was laying about 30 feet northwest of the main electric box!How easy could it have been after the ride closes and maintenance picks it up...and of course, hands it in... BUT NO ! NOT at SIX FLAGS MAGIC MOUNTAIN in Southern California!Then we received the email notice the iphone was moved from rollercoaster X2 closer to guest relations... We were there on Th, June 15 up to 11pm, on June 16, June 17 (when we got the email notice from the App on Sat.morning 5:50am), June 19,... I cannot believe the runaround we received and the unwillingness of guest relations to move a finger (besides looking into their lost and found bins in the back room for a long time).Security and operations told us to come back in the evening, to come back in the morning, and when I ask for supervisors and managers who would know the schedule for the maintenance people to contact them about the location of the phone, I was simply told nobody knows the schedule of maintenance... I guess this iphone is already sold on ebay or craigslist...!",luke945

40,World class roller coasters but very busy and expensive,"Six Flags Magic Mountain has arguably the best collection of roller coasters of any park on the planet. There are 19 of them, and many are top quality examples of their genre. I had visited the park once before in 2002 but since then they had added 10 new coasters, so I knew I had a challenging day, and the park is always very busy. To be fair, some of the rides had quite short lines and for weekend days the Sunday is often quieter than the Saturday, but nevertheless most of the better rides had lines of 1 hour and upwards.The park is also expensive, even with advance purchase of tickets via their website I paid $64 for one person, plus $20 for parking. There is also the cost of lockers to take into account as most of the big rides don't allow loose articles on the platform. I rented an all-day locker which was another $12...so with admission and parking there was $100 gone straight away, and that's before buying food or drink, and of course that's just for one person.In terms of the best rides, I loved Twisted Colossus (30 min queue), Tatsu (1 hour), Full Throttle (1 hour), Goliath (1 hour) and Superman (45 minutes). My least favourite was Scream and Green Lantern (found them both painful). I wanted to ride New revolution but they have added VR headsets to the ride and the sign said it was a 2-hour wait (I didn't have time) and sadly the wooden coaster Apocalypse was closed for the day.Overall the park is an adrenalin-seekers heaven, but expensive and also be prepared for long waits for the best rides, often in the blazing heat.",Davidjellis
50,Thrill Rides Galore,Try to go mid- week. Best when not 100 degrees out. Crowded. Get front of line /fast passes is worth the extra money. Excellent ride. Shady people everywhere. Food Sucks!!,Steve A
30,"Great fun, expensive and ride breakdowns","What a day - we did have an absolute blast at the park, however it is important to note that, as expected food is way overpriced, and you can't bring any food or drinks into the park. The rollercoasters are super fun but unfortunately the day was marred slightly by being stuck on not one, but 2 rides during the day, and were next in line for a third when that one became held up for 20minutes too.",Sarah H
30,Awesome thrill rides but typical amusement park service and prices,"All the thrill rides are extremely good and most are worth the wait. Twisted Colossus, Superman, and Lex Luther are usually faster moving lines along with the older coasters like Scream and Ninja. You can expect to wait for over an hour for the rest of the thrill rides on an average summer day. Monday though Thursday during the Summer may have slightly shorter lines.The park prides themselves on the park rules including a no cut policy; however, it is all eyewash as none of the employees ever did anything to enforce the line cutting policy even when it occured right in front of them. This is the biggest drawback as a number ofthe people attending the park send people ahead to get in line while they go get food/drink or go the restroom. Once they cut through line to rejoin their party, the other go do the same thing. It is very annoying, especially to all of us who obey the rule and point it out to the staff only to be ignored.Parking is ridiculous unless you have a Gold Pass Membership or an annual parking pass. It is $25 on top of the admission price. Also, just like most other theme parks, all the food is extremely overpriced and not really worth it, except for maybe the Coldstone.Lastly, the memberships and yearly passes are misleading as they say they are valid at all Six Flags Parks, but they are not valid at Six Flags Hurricane Harbor. Last time I checked Six Flags Hurricane Harbor is one of the Six Flags parks within the country but guess not as you are required to by a combo pass to get access to it. So much for ""Unlimited admission to ALL Six Flags theme parks including Six Flags Discovery Kingdom"" which is what they advertise on their website and at the park. Either way they are out to get their money and false advertising is not an issue. Also, the food, drink, and merchandise benefit discounts are not close to what other parks offer. These discounts are extremely selective and not all encompassing.Overall, the rides are very good, but the staff and overall management are something to be desired.",moiHere
50,Coasting Above The Rest,"There's no arguing against it, the Roller-Coasters at Six Flags are some of the best on the world. Tatsu, Twisted Colossus, Goliath, X2 and Full Throttle were the favourites amongst our group. Visit weekdays if possible to avoid the crowds.",Toby Wise
30,Old Park - Decent,"We have season passes. The kids area is a good size with 4 small roller coasters. There are other rides available but they aren't all open simultaneously. This is even more true during the off peak season. Shows don't start until June and only last through the summer. Food lines are long so be prepared to wait to refill your drink bottle. A friend recommended going to the store that have the coke machines that you can select your own drink with the touch screens. Those locations are spread throughout the park.Generally, the park is old and things could be updated and renovated. The price of the season pass is incredible so you get what you pay for. Parking is a bit far so make sure to have your walking shoes.",Cynthia A
30,Fun but not as great as I expected,First off we bought the platinum flash pass. Four of the rides you can only ride once with the pass. For $115 a person this is crazy! One other ride to use your flash pass you have to pay $15 more a person to ride it once with the flash pass. I'm glad we did not do that and watched the app for wait times and went when it was not long. So glad we did not pay more as neither myself or son like the ride. It was so jerky we both got off with a headache. Back to the one time rides with the flash pass. I get they want to keep the lines moving but then at least let you use it once every 1-2 hours so you get your money's worth. We most everything but still with the flash pass we stayed till closing. I was disappointed that several of the rides were not good. We are thrill seekers and I am not sure I have ever not liked a roller coaster. I like some more than others but there were four that were terrible. Two were not running all day which stunk. The roller coaster that uses VR was really cool and that was a new experience for us. Overall we had fun but I'm not sure we would go again on our next visit. Paying over $400 for two people and then not being able to ride some rides more than once makes the value not great. Lady thing is beware there is very little shade. Six flags should know in this kind of heat you need more shade and all the eating areas should be shaded. Being early June I'd hate to visit in July or August when it's even hotter.,Jennifer L
50,Schools oout for the summer,"My family and I had a great time. The lines weren't long and the weather was great. We loved full throttle. My Daughter and I screamed so loud on it that we lost our voices for a couple of days,😃",Jamie R
50,Flash pass is a must in the summer!,"If you and your kids love roller coasters and you are going to Magic Mountain in the summer, the flash pass is a must. We had a great time. The kids were thrilled that they did not have to wait in the 2 hour lines for MOST of the rides. Now not every ride is included in the flash pass. We had to wait in line for the newer rides but the flash pass is a must and worth every penny unless you enjoy standing in line all day and only going on about half of the rides.",valsvacation
10,They're thieves,"I really want to give zero stars because 1 just isn't low enough. I will never go to Six Flags Magic Mountain again. I had and am currently having a NIGHTMARE of an experience. We were on a graduating class trip and all was well, except for the rude employees and over priced awful food, until I lost my phone. As soon as I lost it I notified customer relations and they told me to fill out the missing items claim online (which by the way, their website is in DESPERATE need of attention, trust me it's pitiful.) So I did immediately. I gave them WAY more description than they would ever need to find my phone including the exact place I lost it (and I knew because my friends saw it but because it was behind a fence, we could not retrieve it and I also went to my phone company, had them track it and they gave me the EXACT location) I was told after I filled out the form that they would be walking the track after the park closed before the upcoming grad night opening. So we waited...and when I say we I mean students from my entire school waited for almost 2 hours. When I came to check back when they told me to, I was told there's nothing we can do about it and the phone company's tracking was inaccurate (seriously??? even though they gave me coordinates???) we'll find it in the next few days and ship it back to you.It's been almost a month...I have heard nothing from them except for the occasional ""Sorry we're still looking"" email. And when I try to call them I get the stupid automated machine and can NEVER talk to a human being. I have done everything in my power to retrieve my lost item and they have not shown one ""human effort"" to find it, just stupid automated emails and answering machine.Needless to say, I'm calling their corporate office with my complaint because if they really cared about me or my lost item (as they say they do) they would look where I told them to and I would have my phone back. Therefore they're making false claim. Lies, lies, lies!Not only did I have to pay an OUTRAGEOUSLY pricey ticket, but I lost my over $700 phone and they refuse to make an effort to find it. So don't waste your time or your money they're thieves",Isabella F

50,Fun for all ages!,"We have a membership and go about 6 times a year. It is a safe, fun place to enjoy with your family and friends! Twisted Colussus is AWESOME! The smoothness of the ride and the fact that you get to experience it on two different tracks! WOW!! Plus it's very rarely crowded! Looking forward to the new superhero area and I love that they are always working to improve the park with either new rides or attractions!",Chellei J
50,Thrill Seeker Heaven,"This was my first visit ever to the park and I have to say it was an excellent way to begin the summer. Magic Mountain is a must for adventurous souls. We went during a Wednesday and even with bus-loads of students joining us, the wait-times were minimal (longest was 45 minutes).Definitely buy the season pass when they go on sale. Every holiday presents an opportunity for steep discounts on the passes and the bonus features (ex. Bring-a-friend days) make the extra $25 worth it. Johnny Rocket's burgers were good quality and ready quick, although expensive ($14 for a Double Rocket combo).Beware of the shoulder harness on Viper as it will cause discomfort on the neck (and shoulders, of course). Goliath ends very abruptly. However, I never felt unsafe on any of the rides (even Tatsu which had you braced in only by two separate shoulder harnesses and locks around the legs).",Chad R
50,My favorite Amusement/Theme park in the country!,"This park has all thrill rides, including drop of doom, many crazy rollercoaster's and other attractions. It's ok for kids, but I wouldn't recommend it. Do not do the rides Viper, Apocolypse, or Green Lantern. Viper and Apocolypse are way far bumpy, and give you hard headaches after it. Green Lantern hurts your neck, and might give you bad motion sickness. I would not reccomend this park for handicap people, or pregnant people, etc. However, thrill seekers out there, if not before, you must come to the park!",enriquecruz3002
10,Disability Assistance Disappointment,"To start, my family and I have been to 7 different six flags parks within the past three years. Magic Mountain is the worst of all of them for disabled people. At every other park, they were glad to hand out line skipping passes to disabled people. All you needed was a doctors note and ID. With this pass, you go through the exits of rides and then board on the next tram. However, at this park, getting a pass was an unexpected hassle. We followed the general guidelines of what to have on the note that is on the website, but they still could not accept our letter because it ""disclosed too much information about my diagnosis."" (The note was very brief, only about 4 sentences). Because they could not accept it, they had to call the doctors office and talk to the doctor, himself. This took up valuable time (45 minutes). After getting the pass, we headed to rent a wheelchair for the day. Although the normal wheelchair is $25, do not buy this one because the park is very hilly. It took three people to push me to one ride because they tired out quickly. So, we went back to the rental place and got an electric wheelchair for and additional $75 on top of the regular wheelchair, admission, and parking.After getting a disability pass and an electric wheelchair, I wanted to go on the rides. However, most of the loading bays where riders get on the ride are on the second floor and require stairs. More than HALF of the rides did not have functioning elevators. The stair cases were each over 30 stairs. After climbing the stairs, I was greeted by unfriendly staff that refused to help me get on and off of the rides. (I just needed them to take crutches away when I boarded and bring them to me after the ride, so I could crutch over to the wheelchair. Furthermore, many of the rides would not let me on because I had a boot brace on my leg, although it could fit in the tram.With the disability pass, you are allowed to enter the ""disabled entrance,"" but this was never clearly marked. The signs were placed around corners that you wouldn't see nor expect. It was an awful direction system.Most importantly, this park did not have ample amounts of signs directing where handicap people could board the rides. My family was guessing if we needed to go to the normal entrance, flash pass entrance, exit, or another hidden entrance. If we went up the wrong exit, they would make us travel around and up the other way. When we followed their directions to go up the other way, we came to practically the same place at the end.At the end of the day, the rides that I were on were fun, but not worth the giant hassle. I would strongly recommend not going on Viper, Giant Colossus, or Tatsu if you have an injury.To give credit to my post, I have made it around the USS Midway aircraft carrier, Angel's Baseball Game, the Queen Mary, Hollywood, and many other places without a discomfort or disappointment concerning my disability within the same month.",387Chris

40,Flash Pass or Not? That is the question,"I took my teenaged son with me for this visit and we had good experience. So we went on Memorial Day weekend so it was a BUSY Saturday to say the least. I have a season pass because it was on sale for the same price as a day pass, so it was a good buy in my mind. I called them several times to try and understand the different passes and discounts and such, and in five calls I was never able to actually speak to a person; just voice prompt after voice prompt all turning me to the webpage. That's relevant because I was trying to understand that flash pass thing I read about on the webpage.Well, no luck talking to anybody so when we got there we decided to get in line and test our luck. The wait for the first ride was 90 minutes, after 15 minutes or so I wasn't spending my day waiting in line anymore. I'm a business man and time is worth money and 90 minutes per ride is a big deal in my mind. Enter the Flash Pass; the one object you can pay an obscene amount to use for the day, and really piss off just about everyone who didn't shell out the $150 per person to use this thing. The platinum pass was simple, set the reservation for a ride and then by the time we walked over to the ride our wait time was pretty much expired and we were able to walk directly up the exit to the ride and jump to the front of the line. They even put out little flash Pass stickers to direct you in the correct area. Not bad, but considering it costs what most car payments do for the two of use to use it, I'd say it was only worth it because it was Memorial Day weekend.So my experience is I got what I paid for. I got to go to the front of the line, and I paid an obscene amount to do that.I don't get Air sick, sea sick, train sick, or anything but those VR headsets ruined my day. I would've enjoyed the ride without them, with them I barely made it through the ride without getting sick. Both my son and I felt ill when we used them so next time I'll skip that fun thanks. Try it yourself and let me know how it goes for you please. If I've given you solid advice please just let me know it was helpful.Thanks",Keith N

50,Six Flags Magic Mountain,"We had a blast. The views are wonderful. it was an easy drive from LA. The temperature was perfect. We went on Thursday and the crowds were small. My husband and son loved the roller coasters. They said the rides were great. We loaded the Six Flags app and were able to get the wait times for all the rides. The wait times were very short, so they were able to ride over and over again on many of their favorite rides. Highly recommend this for families that love the big roller coasters.",WorryWartPB
40,One of the better amusement parks,I really like roller coasters so Six Flags is definitely up there on my list. As it is on many other peoples lists apparently judging by the long lines to every single ride. But then again it's all worth it on a nice sunny California day.,Navigate463955
50,Six Flags,"What a great park! Amazing rides,great food.Train your staff a little better. When you ask where something is and they answer,""I don't know I just started..."" not a good answer.3 year season pass holder with Premium meal plan.Best deal in town! Always a great time and fun day!!! Keep up the good work.",Charlie C
40,Research for off-season times!,"LOVE the thrill of all the rides, but its always packed. Take the time to research when the best time to come is. I would stay away from the Revolution. VERY rickety, gives headaches.",Pia T
50,Magic Mountain is the KING of Roller Coasters,"So we have had Six Flags season passes for almost 2 years now, been to several of their parks in various parts of the country. But Magic Mountain is definitely the best one for the thrill rides by far.... they have the greatest selection of thrill rides and it's a large park so even when it's busy it usually not too bad of a wait. I think the longest line we waited in was just about an hour or so. But we are crazy roller coaster lunatics so we keep coming back here to ride them. Love X2, Tatsu, Goliath, Superman, Riddlers Revenge, Drop of Doom and several others! A great place to take your kids... as long as your adult stomach can handle all the thrills! All the food we've tried in the park has been pretty good as well, so we recommend getting a food pass along with the season pass, makes for a nice day together and is fairly priced. Lots of fun to be had so try it out, and plan for a full day of thrills and chills!",Gabriel002
40,One of the best themeparks in the world,We visited a couple of weeks ago and Magic Mountain remains one of the best theme parks in the world. The rollercoasters consistently deliver (although give the Green Lantern a miss if you value your manhood!).Only giving 4 stars because food and drink in the park is priced extortionately.,PaulRoberts89
50,Fun for all ages,"I met up at Six Flags with my family and there was so much to do for all ages. I loved Scream and Batman, my five year old niece loved Flash, my stepdad liked Batman, my boyfriend's brother loved Superman and, overall, we had a great time. Lots of food choices, lots of walking so wear comfortable shoes. We got there about 45 minutes after it opened and stayed until it closed and I had almost 20,000 steps. They have really cute character capes for kids and they were only $6.50. There was also this game we played where you could win a character cape for $5.00 and everyone won something except first place won a hat instead of a cape. I have only been once before and that was probably 12 years ago so I vaguely remembered it. It's expensive but worth it. If you have young kids, make sure they are over 48 inches tall so they can ride some of the rides. My niece was 44 inches tall and could only ride maybe 5 rides max but she rode Flash 4-5 times and loved it. It's just like a carnival ride and it goes around in circles. They have decent food that you would normally find at an amusement park. I could probably have done a second day there. They also have a deal going on where if you buy a day pass, you get a season pass free. If you are going for memorial day weekend, take a look into that. From what I understand, the season pass ends the end of December.",Abbie G
50,Amazing! Best coasters I've been on!,"Stopped here for a day on my own while on business. I love this place! Compared to other theme parks there is less theming and other stuff but a lot more rides and the rides are amazing! If you're a thrill seeker this is the place for you! Queues were really short, managed to walk straight on to every ride. The only thing to note, the park is very big and hilly. If it's very hot, make sure lots of water and sunscreen. My personal favourite ride was twisted colossus!",Luke
50,So many rides,You can never get bored here with so many rides for everyone. You need the whole day and if its busy and you want to ride all then the flash pass is a great way to do that,vampslayer01
50,Thest BEST!,Six Flahs is definitely the King of Coasters in southern California. So many great rides. The ride Tatsu is not to be believed. I recommend a weekday as theme parks get very crowded on weekends. Get the thrills of your life!,Goodspeed11
50,Fun! As always,"Day was a little to hot, but is expected, I would say is the perfect time to visit the park, specially right before Memorial Day.The lines were all short, the longest we wait for a ride was 15 minutes and we have time to do all of them and a few rides 2 to 3 times.I like all the rides in this park, but my favorite one this time was Twisted colossus, this bad boy was remodel and let me tell you, the new version is insanely fast and crazy fun, bunch of twists, drops and more drops.",AngelMoralespr
50,"Fun, great experience","We loved it, its a very good place for thrill ride. There very scary rides, oh my God!!!Everybody should try it!!!",Crush80
40,Great time! Go on Weekday,"We went on a Thursday while school was still in session in California. The lines were non-existent! On 80% of the rides, we could stay on! So nice It was a perfect day to spend here. The ride operators were friendly. The food was very good where we ate. Soda's are ridiculously expensive! If you really have to have a soda, purchase their special soda bottle and refills are free on that day. Parking is also ridiculously expensive at $23, but a suppose it's a necessary evil. Also, I would recommend purchasing your tickets in advance online. If you purchase at lease 7 days in advance, you get a big discount! Well worth the stinking ""convenience fee"" they charge.",JulesLVball
50,Amazing in every way,"Words of advice:1. go on a quiet day (not a weekend or school holiday).2. pre-book tickets online (they let you in 10 mins early via the golden pass queue - we got 4 rollercoaster rides before anyone else got into the park!).3. Get nachos from the Mexican place before DC universe world - massive portion big enough for two people and similar price to outside the park (everything else is very expensive in the park).So many amazing rides, thrills and fun all day!",Ben N
20,Not sure how this has such a great review.......,"I've tried the flash pass twice now. It really doesn't enhance your park experience, except for maybe two or three rides. Which wasn't worth the $130/person price in my mind.Basically, the flash pass works by holding your spot in line. You can hold your spot in one line at a time. Not all rides allow you to use this pass, and many rides only allow it once per day. So, for example, we wanted to ride X2, Tatsu, and New Revolution when we got to the park at 11am. All 3 rides had a 45 minute wait at the time. X2 doesn't allow flash passes. New Revolution had a 1-time flash pass available, the time showed 11:50, so we could book the pass now and wait until 11:50, then go to the shorter fast pass line. Tatsu had an 11:30 flash pass, with unlimited passes. So we clicked the Tatsu pass, and then went and rode viper (20 minute line) before going to tatsu.The flash pass line for Tatsu was still 15 minutes. Less than 45, for sure, but still 15. So they scanned our flash pass around 11:50, at which point we could book our next one. We chose New Revolution, which was not at 12:40. We rode tatsu, and decided we had time to do the white water rapid ride while we waited for our turn to cut the line at New Revolution. We got to new revolution at 12:45, and used the flash pass. It still took us about 25 minutes in line to get on the ride.The flash pass works like the disney fast passes, but it isn't as good. Because you can only use the flash pass on some rides, and the main attractions have a limit of 1 flash pass per day.I think the pass probably saved us about 1.5, maybe 2 hours of wait time during the day. But, it was $260 for two people, and was very limiting. We didn't even get to ride all the rides we wanted because of lines, even with the pass.The second time we used the pass, the park wasn't very busy. We actually found that the flash pass lines were LONGER than the regular lines on that day. It routes you through the exit, and up a separate entrance. Every ride, except new revolution and tatsu, had a longer flash pass line than regular line. It was obscene.If the park wants to charge $70 for entrance, and $130 for this 'platinum' pass, they need to actually have valuable benefits for the pass. It's ridiculous for them to con you into spending 3x the entrance price for somethign that doesn't actually provide any benefits.",Jacquelynn B
50,Great place!!,"My kids and I always come here, at least twice a year. Both my kids love this place, there is something for kids all ages and if you like speed and amusement rides; this is the place.",Roger C
40,Thrill rides galore,"Unfortunately, the day we went to six flags I was unwell and had a sickness bug so I didn't get to go on hardly anything which was SO disappointing as I am a huge lover of thrill rides, and this park boasts so many things about their rides - largest/tallest/longest/fastest in the world for many attractions.The queues weren't too bad in comparison to some of the places we went, however lots of rides were closed (or kept closing throughout the day) which was pretty annoying. A lot of food and beverage places were closed so it was really hard to get a drink at times, which is not ideal when it is super hot.",Lo B
40,Amazing thrills!,"I frequent this area of SoCal for work and decided that this year I'd purchase an annual pass as it was a great deal. Until last week I hadn't been to the park in years. I was fortunate enough to go on a Monday morning. There were little to no lines on most rides. My visit was in mid May, so there were a few rides getting some love and were closed. Not a big deal. Can't wait to go back!",JetSetterRobb
50,Fantastic day out!,"Arrived fifteen minutes before opening and there was hardly anyone there! We'd read others on TripAdvisor recommending a mid-week visit (a Wednesday in this case), but had no idea it would be this easy.The day was amazing. We rode everything we could find, and then rode our favourites again and (in one case) again.We didn't interact with too many members of staff but those we did were friendly and courteous. Food and drink is expensive - a small bottle of water costs an alarming $4.50, but there are water fountains outside many of the public toilets scattered throughout the park. A medium Coke and single portion of chips was $13.25, but provided plenty enough for two.Only one disappointment really - 'The New Revolution' - after a long wait while staff struggled with faulty visors, we shot off to experience VR for the very first time, but neither of our visors worked properly - mine functioned for about ten seconds before my vision was filled with a notice saying that it had overheated and needed to be rested, my companions cut straight to the room interior that (we think) forms the very last scene of the ride. Rubbish. It looks like the technology isn't up to the job. If we'd queued for an hour to experience that, we'd have been very unhappy indeed! The operators did invite us to try again, but we felt there was so much else to do in the park that we'd already wasted enough time.Six Flags has garnered lots of 'ests'. It's the biggest concentration of roller coasters in the world, it has the longest coaster, the fastest coaster, the coaster with most inversions, the coaster with the biggest vertical loop and the highest coaster. It has coasters you sit down on, coasters you lie down on and coasters you stand up on! It has metal coasters, wooden coasters and hybrid coasters that are part wood, part metal. It's very difficult to imagine a better place to be if enjoy a good roller coaster!",Mike_Kwasniak
50,Still great as an adult!,"I think this year was the first time I have come back to Six Flags as an adult, and the rides and experience is still just as awesome. Membership is a great rate and parking is a good rate too. Weekdays are the best to go! We were literally walking onto rides, no waiting in line. I love being able to go to Six Flags any time I want... Perks of being a grown up!",Rebecca T
50,here we go,"if you want to avoid the lines head there on a Monday. Six Flags does not allow you to bring in food, so hide it on yourself and get by security - Go ride X2 first because the line is shortest early in the day",lombose
30,Amazing coasters but needs a bit of love,"Six Flags Magic Mountain is famous for housing some of the worlds most thrilling roller coasters, in times of height, loops, speed and is worth the visit just for that. Visiting as a party of adults we were lucky enough to be able to choose an off season, mid week day with great weather which resulted in practically zero queues.Parking is on a paid basis and priced by distance to the door with valet and right next door being most expensive options, the cheaper self park wasn't too much of a walk but was $25 dollars before we even entered the park. Park entrance itself was another U$160 for two but did allow you to upgrade to a season ticket for the same price (seasonal offer). Despite the cheaper entrance price spend whilst in the park mounted up fast with nearly $5 for a water or soda and approx $20 for two ice cream sundaes. Not specifically a Six Flags issue I think this is common within all theme parks.Most of the attractions were open -those that weren't were clearly noted prior to entering the park. Food was pretty much standard theme park options burgers, fries, chicken and chips. The general facilities such as toilets were a bit sad and in need of some tlc. Staff were friendly and helpful.Worth a visit if you are an adult party or family with older kids but its def all about the rides rather than the overall park experience.",cconta
10,Fatal,Some of the attractions are close. Very Bad service. The park are dirty and Very Bad Experience. Never again,PierreCruz
40,For Coaster Enthusiasts!,"I traveled here on a whim and the fact that it was under 40 minutes from the Pasadena area helped. The ride there is all mountains, so make sure your car is filled up with gas, coffee in hand, you've got your road trip playlist and you've made rest stops previously.*Parking is $23 which is pretty insane.*I went during a weekday early afternoon and I would 100% suggest this. The park is so big and drawn out that it could easily get exhausting when packed.This park is loaded with world record coasters and on more than one ride I found myself saying ""Oh my gosh...I've never been so far up in the sky before"". It was terrifying / amazing. I endorse forcing yourself on any ride that scares you! The rush after is incredible.The only ride I would probably never return on is X2. No joke, it twisted my spine and neck to the point I spent 5 days in insane pain after. I think that must be a lawsuit ride.Anyways super fun! Definitely would go here on discount tickets again",DoubleR7
50,Great park,I love coming to this park its one of my favorites. They have a lot of childrens and families rides.,437emelyg
50,Gem of California,I have been to Magic Mountain several times before and I will definitely be coming back soon! I went in a group of 7 and the fun was endless! We had a wonderful time on and off the rides and I can't wait to come back.,e-miller-000
40,Cali's best coasters,"Pretty massive park with tons of rollercoaster variety. If you want to check out the more popular thrill rides like Tatsu, Twisted Colossus and Goliath, go early and go on a weekday. We managed to get the majority of them done in the first 3 hours with minimal wait times. The park really isn't laid out well though and it can be tough to find entrances to rides, or shortcuts to others. Be aware of the Viper coaster, it's an extremely rough ride as it's from the 90's. X2 is their most popular coaster but it is REALLY intense, and I'm a roller coaster fanatic. Food prices are insane so just pack yours yourself. Slap on that sunscreen cause it's a scorcher.",Devon H
50,Birthday,Today is my brothers birthday and even though the park closed early to the public. It was still a great day. Riddler was down and twisted Colossus was up and down with working properly. But today was a great day.,Jojo R
50,The greatest place on earth,"Such a fun place to visit. Fun for the thrill seekers and families alike. Lots of rides and shows for the little ones, and lots of roller coasters for the adult child in all of us. My very favorite place on earth!!",pamela v
50,The rides! The rides!,"If you like coasters, this place is for you. Quite a few thrill rides. There's plenty for the youngest, too, with a kid's area. You'll need to be okay with some hill climbing as there are a few paths through the park that are a bit steep - though these can be avoided by taking the long way around, for the most part. Teens will love it for sure. I'm older now, but have been going to Magic Mountain since the 1990's and am pleased so see they send a fair amount of money building new and exciting coasters.",James D
20,Disappointing,"Many rides closed, long slow queues for main entrance, crazy prices for parking and fast passes.Had we paid full gate price would have been extremely disappointed. OK for a few hours whilst passing through. The best rides ARE amazing, but the rest are either closed or a very slow queues for a very below average ride.We managed just 3 rides in 5 hours, precious vacation time wasted.",BlueMoonRisen
50,Picked a perfect day!,"Typically I hear that the park is very busy but this time the park was great. There was a light sprinkle throughout the day, and a couple of rides shut down temporarily, but the lines were not near as long as expected. I went on May 6th and the whether probably contributed to several locals not wanting to go. Nobody in my party purchased the flash pass and I didn't hear any complaints about it.",Jake L
40,Had no idea it was going to be so busy!!,"Me and my husband visited from England during our 3 week honeymoon to the Los Angeles area.We booked our tickets online for a Wednesday in October, thinking it would be quieter on a weekday.. It must have been busier than Disneyland! You couldn't move! We only managed to do a few rides. I wish we could have returned another day to do the ones we missed out on!X2 was insane! There's nothing like it back home in England so that was the main one I wanted to do, I think we waited in line well over an hour for it. Worth it though! I even bought the photo!I would definitely recommend this place and would happily return!",tyrant_virus
30,Large/Plus Size Rider Info at Six Flags MM,"I recently visited Six Flags Magic Mountain and wanted to provide some information on the restraints for the roller coasters as I had a hard time finding any information on this that was current and accurate.I am 5’11 and wear a size 24/26 with an average chest area at about a 48 C. My waist is my problem area, at about 53 inches, but can be somewhat compressed. Because I was going to be at a special event with virtually no lines, I did all the embarrassing work and tried everything that was open.This is purely informational. If you’re wondering about the seating/experience for a large person, please read on.Rides that were closed/didn’t try: Apocalypse, Riddler’s, X2, Tatsu, all the little kiddie/carny type ridesThere are no weight restrictions. If you can fit and all belts/restraints close sufficiently, you can ride. There are also no tester seats for the rollercoasters. You gotta wait in line, and try it out yourself. Note that the carnival type rides have small restraints in general, so I didn't bother with them.Batman: Suspended coaster, in which you sit in molded seats with an OTSR that latches to a seatbelt type device between the legs. My rear did not fit in this seat. Note that these seats are I feel abnormally small, as I saw some other folks that were average/larger but not obese, struggling to get in these. I did not try the OTSR because I couldn’t sit in the seat.Full Throttle: Molded lap bar with a green light system with shin guards. This means the lap bar has to close a certain amount before they will let you ride. Note that there is also a seat belt on this ride that I understand is new. I tried the belt, and it left about a 9 inch gap to close. They will not let you ride without the belt, there are no larger seats and no seat belt extenders available.Goliath: This is a molded lap bar with large, roomy, rubber padded seats. There is a new seat belt on this ride, however, that left about 6 inches gap for me to close. No larger person options, but I felt the belt was a bit more forgiving than other coasters.Green Lantern: This is a molded seat with a sturdy OTSR that latches to the seat. There is a height minimum AND maximum. The seat was snug, but I fit in. My tummy wouldn’t allow the OTSR to close. I wouldn’t have ridden if it did though, because this ride is like a human Plinko machine, and I didn’t think I would be comfortable having my weight thrown against my stomach.Ninja: This is an OTSR ride only, no belts, in a boat-like car that seats two people across. I fit on this just fine. I feel like if you have an exceptionally large chest/stomach, this might be an issue, but I didn’t see anyone else have a problem with this ride. Note that this ride has high sides on the cars, which made getting in/out of them a bit awkward for me, but it was doable. Watch your step!New Revolution: This ride has a lap bar, slightly molded seat, and a seat belt. The belt was like 8ish inches too small for me. This ride now offers VR headsets, which is basically a pair of heavy goggles with a cell phone device in it. You can choose not to wear it. Because of the headsets, loading for this coaster is super slow.Scream: Floorless coaster, with molded seats and an OTSR, which buckles between the legs. While my rear fit in the seat, it forced my stomach forward and caused issues with the belt restraints. The trains seat four people across - note that rows 4 and 5 each have one seat with double belts that are slightly longer. These were about 2 inches too short for me to close.Superman: This ride has molded seats with a really big cage type OTSR deal that belts in. I fit in this ride, barely, but I didn’t feel comfortable riding it. The rows are also snug. I hit my ribs on the OTSR for the rows in front of me while walking in.Tatsu: While this ride was available, I didn’t attempt this ride for the same reason I didn’t ride Green Lantern. The ride forces you into a “flying” position which, from what I understand, puts the stress on your shins/knees and stomach. I didn’t want to deal with that at my size so I didn’t try it. It has an OTSR that clips with a big vest type closure at the stomach. I knew I wouldn’t fit on it. Probably would need to be a 40-42” waist or have ability to mold into something that size to work.Twisted Colossus: I was really sad about this one, and then not so much. Molded seats with a molded lap bar/shin bar, and a seat belt. These belts are REALLY SMALL. I needed like 12+ inches or more to get close to closing this one. Once my boyfriend went on it - he told me why the belts are probably so small. There’s a part in the ride where you are held upside down for a substantial part of the ride, over the top of the train below you. This puts you in a (from top to bottom) track, train, person, air, person, train, track sandwich. BF said it puts a lot of pressure on your pelvis/thighs/waist, so you have to be able to be held in properly.Viper: I had 0 issues on this coaster. OTSR, seemed to be really forgiving and roomy, and the cars were spacious and easy to get into.The employees were nice and helpful when I asked them questions. They take a pretty hands-off approach and let me walk on, try the seat, and then walk off without drawing any attention to me.Atmosphere was pretty standard, nothing grandiose. Lots of hills, lots of stairs. You have to be able to walk and climb. Most of the lines and queues have staircases in them. Some rides have elevators for disabled access as well.I was super nervous about going, but I was able to ride a couple of things, and had fun anyway. I hope this helps someone. <3",CupcakeTurnips
50,Cedar Point vs Six Flags: Magic Mountain; FIGHT!,"First of all, let me start by saying, I grew up at Cedar Point and while that does give me some biases, it also puts CP at a disadvantage because I am very familiar with their rides and have ridden them all many, many times so it isn't as new and exciting.The decor/atmosphere: Cedar Point wins this hands down, in my opinion. Not only for its setting on an island and the beautiful sunsets you'll experience, but for its unrivaled charm; whereas Six Flags ""charm"" comes off as more so needing a serious update than charm. Six Flags has many eyesores in its park; lots of peeling paint, to go along with its atrocious bathrooms. I can look past all of this, though, because I don't come to an amusement park for the quality of the bathrooms or the decorations.The food: I don't know if it's because we only dine at the shops that allow the dining pass, but the meals at Six Flags are BY FAR the worst part of the Six Flags experience. The meals are ridiculously overpriced if you don't have a dining pass and what you get for your money has to be the worst quality food I have ever eaten. And we have eaten at every single place that accepts the dining pass. A regular trip to McDonald's will seem like fine dining after eating here. Cedar Point isn't anything to write home about in this department, but does blow Six Flags out of the water.The rides: THE most important thing. And I'm sure the big debate is what part has better rollercoasters. This is tricky. I would say, overall, CP has better rides. However, I think I would have to say Magic Mountain has better rollercoasters. That being said, CP has the best coaster of the bunch, in Dragster. However, the trio of X2, Tatsu and Twisted Colossus make Magic Mountain the overall winner in the coaster department, in my opinion. It is very close, though.Overall: Both parks are fantastic. The best 2 parks I've ever visited. I think, hands down, though, the winner would have to be Cedar Point. And it's because of the overall experience. Small details, like adding a petting zoo for children(and adults!) where you can feed and interact with a wide variety of animals. Small details, like the amount of effort they put into their HalloWeekends. Small details, like keeping up with their rides; I cannot tell you how many times I've waited in line for lengthy periods of time, gotten right up to the gates for a ride and had Six Flags staff come on the PA and say the ride is down - this happens much more rarely at CP. Small details, like the quality of the multiple locations of live performances that can be seen each and every day at the park - whereas, as far as I know, Six Flags does not even have any live performances going on anywhere at the park. If money is not much of an object, CP also boasts a top class hotel directly on the island, which also allows you to get into the park early. If you are deciding between a strictly amusement park oriented vacation and are trying to decide between Six Flags MM and Cedar Point, I IMPLORE you to choose CP - you will NOT regret it! In any case, both are great parks and both deserve 5-star ratings.",LALoner
40,In need of some TLC,"The rollercoasters at this park are top notch. Tatsu is one of the best and provides a thrilling experience and you truly feel like you're flying! X is also incredible and although a bit too bumpy, the ride is something not to be missed. The rides at Magic Mountain will keep you entertained and there is a HUGE variety. I love this place but it needs a major revamping in my opinion. Although the park is fairly clean, many of the major components need an update to 2017. The park entrance sign, park decorations and themes, and landscaping could use some love. Highly recommended but misses the mark as far as exceeding my expectations.",Dashboard179
40,"Fun, but like a labyrinth","The rides that was operating was fun, but is was a big part of the park that was open but without working rides.",Louise B
50,Thrilling experience,I tried most of their roller coasters it's an amazing experience. My only problem was with the VR ride it didn't work,Tarek K
20,Poor Communication,"We entered the park at opening time to find that only two thrill rides were operating. It appeared that staff working on the two top rated ride Tatsu and X2 had been stood down because of high winds. As the morning progressed other rides open but not the 2 above mentioned. I'm a little suspicious as to why they were not operating. My suspicion exists because of the lack of any communication by the park around the limited attractions available. The App did later update this but people should have been informed of rides unavailability when entering and have informed choice, not told after they had paid. Other rides opened later in the day as ironically the winds increased. Another factor supporting my concerns of how the park operates is a staff member stating that rides were closed because the very small crowd that day. Was there ever sufficient staff to run all rides that day?The staff themselves were young, fun and energetic",ecilop55
40,Extreme thrills abound!,"We had a great day at Six Flags Magic Mountain. Here are a few of the highlights:The MM app is good, and definetly improving. I would encourage you to use it for ""wait times"" and reviewing menus, ordering and paying for food...to be picked up AFTER you get off of the nearest ride. I have NO DOUBT they will improve this app.Goliath - A GREAT way to start the day...line was only 15 mins long. Lose you mind on this the longest drop in the park.Twisted Colossus - Hands down favorite of our 10 person group. (ages 50-10 yrs old) We ALL enjoyed this ride.Batman - Great ride, for a whip with your feet dangling freely in the air. DO NOT wear flip flops on this bad boy.Green Lantern - Sinister-ly deceiving. It appears docile and simple....until you experience it.....you will scream.Full Throttle - We rode this 2x ...back to back. The que is set up for fun and adrenaline. The ride doesn't disappoint at all.The NEW Revolution w/ VR experience - Game Changer. You must experience.Tatsu - As a bigger guy, (6'2"" 280lbs.) This ""lack of a mechanical harness restraint"" had me writing my own obituary the ENTIRE RIDE. I have NEVER been so happy to see solid ground again. My legs were sore, from pressing against the ankle harness' to assure I wasn't putting too much pressure on the shoulder restraints. MY g-forces are definetly MORE than the average person....THAT is what was scary. The ride is smooth and a MUST RIDE at night. I have never been so grateful for an inverted loop as I was on this ride....""WHEW! finally on my back.""Scream - This ride opened in the late evening and was worth the walk frotm Tatsu. Its loops and twists are so smooth...I could have ridden it multiple times.I was impressed with the parks cleanliness.I was disappointed that they didn't have water bottle refilling stations at the drinking fountains. Dehydration is a major reason for motion sickness. Drink refills should be in a separate line vs. ordering food. Food choices, in todays society could be healthier...move away from the old Carnival foods and into some leaner choices.It was a great day, we look forward to returning.",Brent T
40,Great fun with few problems,"This park is great because of the rollercoasters and the food is okay, but you should buy a season dining pass because the food tends to be expensive. The employees are mostly attentive, but some are in a bad mood and one did't let my friend get off her seat because she felt unsafe. Overall, it's a fun experience but only because of the rides.",Samantha B
20,Long queues,"The rides are just amazing, there is no doubts about it but whats makes it disappointing is the long queues associated with it. We were able to get onto ride 6 rides in a span of 7 hours. net net it is 1 hour in a queue for 1 minute of thrill. Would rather give this place a skip.",AKK
40,Awesome fun,So went on a few crazy really scary rides.. Was a fun experience.. X2 was the best part.. Only upsetting part was the huge never ending queues we managed 1 ride an hour.. So yea. The wait was long and boring,siddhi261
40,Grandkids to Six Flags,Season Pass is the way to go. Food is expensive and not so good. Lines were OK. Some rides were down the whole time we were there (4 days),maintainin
40,Great rides let down by poor park facilities,"We visited 4 different theme parks with our teenage daughter and this had the best rides. Queues were not big for most rides, worst for us was New Revolution which was 1 hour. Managed 9 big coasters in the day and we left 3 hours before the park closed. So the rides are great now here is why the park is not 5/5. Food outlets are poorly run and the quality was the worst of the 4 parks we visited. Worst aspect was the cleanliness especially in toilets. My wife heard one woman in the toilet with her young daughter say ""not that one, or that one, ok I will come in with you but don't touch anything"".",Tony M
30,Just ok,"Must really love roller coasters. Very expensive for what you get. Teens enjoyed it, adults not so much.",JoAnn0926
50,Rollercoaster City,"We arrived right at opening (1030), however it seemed that the workers had not showed up yet. We walked around the park, and rode 1 rollercoaster, by 1200. There were multiple rollercoasters that were not open until afternoon. Even when they did open the rollercoasters the workers seemed very slow and lazy. However, the rollercaosters were great.",Cory V
50,Top notch!!!,"God! How do I start? We went on SIXTEEN different rollercoasters - one of which we rode FOUR times!! If you're going, I recommend you do what we did, go on a week day, get there early, and have the best of days! It is just mindblowing the amount of rides we got done in one day! My favorites were the colossus and X2 - but obviously my recommendation is to try ALL of them! Such a great day!",bipbipbipbopbop
50,Great fun!,"A great two days spent in Santa Clarita, but avoid the virtual reality as the lag time means you get some awful whiplash. So much fun doing all of the roller coasters, with relatively short waiting times. Highly recommend!",tracey h
50,Full Throttle x2,"a visit is worthwhile but obviously crowded. I visited a friends place in San Diego and we went to Six Flags because we love the adventure. Almost all ages can enjoy, there are different rides.",AmandaKat21
50,Family fun,Had a great time walking distance from hotel the staff were friendly and the waiting time was like 10 minutes or less is wheelchair friendly and the rides were great going back soon.,Milagros O
50,We loved this them park,Having visited so many theme parks around the world-this is definitely best for people who love a roller coaster. The park was not so busy and the most we queued up for was around 40 mins. Most rides we walked straight on to. The food in the park was also nice. Staff were friendly and the park was very clean. Would certainly visit again or another Six Flags park. Very Impressed. Try Twisted Colossus it's brilliant!,TravellingLX
50,Amazingeniero rides,"I was visiting my uncle in California with my mom and my dad. We decided to go to six flags since we love rollercosters. When we got there we weneed straight to Tatsu, this amazing ridexperience that makes you feel like your flying. I was so scared I almost didn't ride it, but my dad convincedied me and I thanknow him bexcuse it was awesome. Then we went to Full Throttle, it was super fast but worth the wait. There are many different rollercoasters but for me those two were the best. I truly loved the park.",Amanda
50,Great Theme Park,"Visited as a family of 5, on a quiet day, so we didn't have to wait too long in line and we all managed to get on the rides we wanted. Certainly recommended for older kids who like thrill rides as this Park has plenty. A must place to visit when in the LA area.",Wintwanderer
40,Spring break visit,"We had one day to spend in LA and we decided to got to rent a car a go to SF from LAX. Drive was about 50 minutes (both ways) and it was a good thing that park was not to crowded. Rides were pretty good and we had a good time, altought we had only 3.5 hours to stay there.Tips:-DO NOT BRING A SELFIE STICK (I had to go back to the car to leave it)-Book 7 days in advance, you will save some good money-Take a look at the map, it shows the rides according to your interests (we didn't do at the beggining and spent 25 mins waiting for Ninja ride which was pretty lame)",Cesar S
30,"Fun rides, inefficient","The rides here are great! Lots of variety for everyone. We love the adrenaline rides like x2, full throttle and the twisted colossus. We love the older ones too like apocolypse. My complaint- the most ineffecient food operators ever. Resources not properly used- 5 people making nachos- 1 cashier also filling drinks. We had our food, getting cold and gross, for 20 minutes before we pay. When suggested that those waiting to make next order, because the line was so backed up, I was told that wasn't their job. Waste of resources and time. We struggled every time we needed food or drink. Six flags- you will lose money here because people won't wait for this nonsense. This has been our experienc the last 3 times so I felt it necessary to include in my review. Plan LOTS of time for any food stops.",Cbethlynn
50,Christmas Wonderland,"Yes, I went with the incredibly tacky and cliched title for a review. This was our second holiday where we visited Magic Mountain and we went before Christmas where our previous visit had been in April. It was cold and got darker quickly but was done up nicely for Christmas.We went for the rides, it was all about the rides for us. We did two days in a row because why do something once when you can do it over and over and over again? Like the X2. Or Twisted Colossus. Or Full Throttle. But not the Green Lantern because two much upside-downy. Especially when your side of the carriage is heavier than the people behind you and you've just had a thickshake.Entry was easy-ish. Getting through security is pretty quick and then you queue for the gates to open. We head straight up to the lockers to dump our stuff, stand around undecided as to whether we should get a fast pass, realise they don't include the best rides and then run to get on the first ride.The park is well laid out and in good condition. Enough info booths, bathrooms and space to walk around crowds and so on, benches to sit and places to get food and drink. It's roughly circular and from the maps you can work out a few route options to cover what you want. Everything appears to be wheelchair accessible.There's a good range of rides and coasters with different styles and ages. Most of the Christmas stuff was from the merry-go-round up towards the Tatsu which had a Dr Seuss christmas area opposite. The Tatsu at night was pretty good with all the lights and views.Food was a bit meh. We generally ate at Johny Rockets and weren't impressed with many of the other options. Souvenir cup was good.Our favourite rides were the Twisted Colossus, X2 and Full Throttle. Apocalypse - wooden coaster - was really good but very bumpy. X2 got a bit bumpy too. Line waiting wasn't too bad, biggest lines were naturally on most popular rides. Longest wait was about an hour and a half for X2 and over an hour for Twisted Colossus but these got much shorter later in the evening. Either do these first thing or later in the evening.We stayed until closing because when we travel this far you squeeze every last drop out of it. Shops stayed open after rides closed so we did touristy shopping as we left. I am wearing the Batman t-shirt I got on the day. My kids don't think I sound like Christian Bale but they're wrong because they're teenagers and they don't appreciate ""I'm BatDad"".Overall, really good days, some great rides and a lot of walking. Fast Pass is a dud for this park, other Six Flags parks seem to have better options.Yes, we would - and have - come back. I want to go again on Father's Day so I can say ""It's father's day"" in a Christian Bale voice. My kids are reluctant to be involved in this. As Batman would say ""ho ho ho""",WizardDad
50,Spring break and not very crowded,We went on spring break and it was not crowded. But there were a few rides that still had long waits. Always a great time at Six Flags. Staff very helpful.,Karen W
50,So much fun!!!,"I hadn't been here in about 16 years, so I was so excited to come for our 10-year wedding anniversary trip. We came with another couple and loved it! There's something for everyone for sure! As always, the rides do not disappoint. My recommendations for TRULY fun rides are: Tatsu (best ride, hands down IMO), Superman (easy, but fun), and Full Throttle (we rode this one like 5 times). Yes, there's other great rides, but these I think are the smoothest rides with equal amount of enjoyment.Food: the hamburger/chicken strip/hot dog places SUCK. Go to places like Johnny Rockets (brand name) or Collossowhich (sp?). Their sandwiches are yummy. People we loved at the park: one of the caricature artists by Full Throttle. I actually can't remember his name, but he's tall, white, skinny, and hilarious. There was also a girl (I think her name is Cat) that worked at Full Throttle. She cracked us up constantly with her creativity at the beginning of each ride. Give that girl a raise!",Pfam07
50,Wish we lived closer!,"Magic Mountain is a huge metal jungle of absolute fun! I wish we lived closer. We learned on day 2, to go to the right when entering. X2 and Tatsu are fun, but we enjoyed Full Throttle, Super Man, Goliath and Lex Luthor so much more and rode multiple times. We are experienced and know how to avoid buying meals or drinks. The prices and lines for food are ridiculous. We overheard one teenager say he would not eat all day. Very sad! There are many water fountains, but they need to add one near Superman. There were line jumpers on every ride. Not just one person, but 3 and 4 people joining their group.",Amy H
40,Spring Break Getaway,I don't have much to say about Six Flags Magic Mountain other than that the roller coasters are always supreme fun. Adrenaline cubed! Will return soon. Have season passes.,eandrade760
50,Wow! Thrill rides for days....,"Tatsu is my (female, 40), my daughter's (age 10) and my husband's (age 40) new favorite roller coaster. It is seriously amazing. All of the other roller coasters and thrill rides are awesome as well. We rode the Viper for the last time before they replace it. My husband and I rode the Viper when it was newer 23 years ago. It was awesome to ride it with our daughter. Six Flags Magic Mountain is one of the best amusement parks in the United States. Thank you!",ravvenesque
30,"Good rides, horrible food lines","This is a park with great rides. When we were here a number of them were under repair or had issues during operation and had to shut down or suspend rides to fix. Overall the park is clean, but does look a little tired. A lot of things could use some fresh paint.One thing that was horrible was the food lines. Some of them were easily over an hour to get a $10 slice of pizza and $5 soft drink. Yes it is a theme park so high prices are expected, but the length of time to wait is just silly. It seemed like a management choice since the food service areas did not have many windows / service locations open. They definitely run under staffed in these areas and it shows.Another thing to note is the constant upsell to upgrade to a season pass, buy the season dining pass, etc. Again probably expected at this kind of park but here it seems worse than others.",Scott W
40,Book in advance and try and go on a weekday (download the app for wait times),"After having read some of the recent reviews you would have thought it was a shocker of a place to go to, ""line queues, having to pay $23 for parking"", etc etc, however we loved it for what it was a theme park with great thrill rides. All my teenage boys were after were high thrill rides and we got that! Sure parking costs $23 however that's called a captive market and if you book online you know what you're getting yourself in for. Speaking of booking online, the further you do this in advance the bigger the discount up to I think 7 days and as short as 3 days, well worthwhile. If you were a theme park enthusiast and compared it to Disney parks it's not nearly as well organ side or managed from a customer's perspective eg the longest wait we had, well over an hour was in a food line at Wascals where one poor girl worked one register trying to serve customers, while one girl made the food out the back (another watched on while eating her lunch). After over an hour they called in reinforcements and opened registers 2 through 4!! The team also don't manage the lines at rides as well with many seats going empty on rides due to poor seat management which ultimately makes wait times longer. That said in Tues 11 April wait times were pretty good. So all in all well worth the visit!",Michael E
40,Trip to Magic Mountain,"Had a great two day trip to Magic Mountain. Went on Monday April 10 and Tuesday April 11. It was not crowded at all. We have a 6 yr old and 11 yr old plus us trill seeking parents. The variety of coasters is great. The kid area is great. Not every ride was open and it seemed like they were short staffed, but still had a great time.",Resort467813
50,had a Blast,"just outside of LA, excellent roller coasters, Full throttle was awesome addition to the park, twisted was great ride. Lines weren't to bad for a friday. Staff at ticket counter was very helpful.",seadweller80
40,Roller coaster heaven,"This is the best roller coaster park.They are different mind blowing and fast.The park was packed we waited 2 hours at one ride and 1and a half ant another, but that what you get going in spring break.What was the worst thing about the park was the number of Line Cutters it was so bad on the Goliath i just turned around misses that ride.I would go back next time I'm in the US but not in the peak season.I visited the park on March 30th 2017...........If you are only there for one day get a fast pass if you can afford it..",jeffrey
50,"No Lines, Great Roller Coasters, Great Weather","I took my 2 boys age 8yr & 10 yrs (both over 54 inch) for Spring Break the first week in April. The weather was perfect, the lines were short. We went for 2 days. The first day we bought the Flash pass (90% reducing in wait time). It would be great on a busy day, but if I would have known how slow the park would be I would have saved the money. We rode every roller coaster on Day 1 (17 rides total). One day 2 we rode our favorites many times and ended with 21 rides for the day (10:30am-6pm). My boys LOVE roller coasters and had a great time. Cedar Point in Ohio is still there favorite, but Magic Mountain is a close 2nd. I found many of the roller coasters to be semi-painful in places: X2, Green Lantern & Scream have one or 2 places they have painful sudden jerks but overall great rides. Viper hurt the entire ride. Twisted Colossus, Goliath, Tatsu and Full Throttle are smooth, painless, Big Thrills rides. Those were our favorites. X2 was also a favorite despite the last jerky loop.I recommend visiting in early April weekday, without a Flash Pass.",Michael M
30,First American trip.,If you like extreme rides this is the place for you. Some of the roller coasters are 250 feet tall. If you're scared of heights like i am you won't enjoy it. The park is quite large and was only open on weekends so was very busy. Transport was easy enough to find. Also the ride restraints are smaller than at Universal Studios so plus sized people like me need to be wary of that.,Duane O
10,Sucks so much,Too long of a line we stand their a hour each line and everything burned down or closed everytime and it was a boring time,Tylo B
50,Had a Ball,I went here with my Unlce it was packed with lots of really good Rides. If you love Rollercoasters then you will probably love this Place .The food and drinks are not cheap some rides are scary Children are welcome because I saw kids there,Rory C
50,amazeballs,this is an amazing park. Drove 6.5 hrs to get here. Haven't been here in 17yrs. It was nice to see some new coasters and attractions. Spent 2 days here. Totally amazing,finallyavacation29
50,Just wow!,My kids are young adults and we had a blast here! It was a quiet day so no real long lineups. Lots of food options although it's ridiculously expensive to eat there. The park is very very clean - very impressive.,Shari L
40,Get your coaster on!,"First, yes you can expect long lines at certain times of the year, yes you can pay quite a bit more for fast passes, which if you can afford, do it, second most coasters are top notch, Twisted Colossus became our favorite, very novel layout, kept looking for where that other coaster came from, turns out you climb the hill twice once as the chaser and the other your being chased, this is a do not miss at all costs!, next favorite is Full Throttle, another do not miss!, the rest are good, so hit the first two as soon in the morning as you can Superman.. great ride to long a line for such a short ride, Goliath, another great ride, X2 is over rated in my book, but worth a try if you haven't done it before, try to hit the park when school is in session for smaller crowds, food is over the top expensive, look for Johnny Rockets family meal deal",robino154
30,Great rides in poorly designed park,"We began the day paying $23 for parking that can't be avoided. The price of admission is steep enough (and expected), but that just put a bad taste in my mouth. We then had to wait in a total of 4 lines before actually getting into the park. Poorly trained employees caused most of the grief here. Upon entering the park, we used some good trip-advisor advice and hustled up the HUGE hill to our highly anticipated ride only to find it was closed. No notifications or handouts had been offered letting us know about this so we hurried to the next attraction that... cost extra. Not included in the price of admission. Same with the next attraction! So we rode a carnival-esque goldmine ride and got gum on the bottom of a shoe or two and hurried to two more closed down rides. The map does not in indicate how to get to the entrance on any of the rides, so we missed one that we were hoping to ride after circling this gargantuan park seeking an entrance. Three stars are given here ONLY because some of the rides are REALLY great thrill rides! Tatsu was a favorite, and the Xtreme thrill was unexpected, fast, and smooth. Great rides. Goliath was good, Green Lantern shakes your brains out, the drop ride is exceptionally high, and the other coasters are high quality coasters. We will not return. The park is very poorly planned with SO much walking and hiking.",bromcd
40,Great for thrill seekers but many rides closed!!,"We visited Six Flags Magic Mountain at the end of March and we were mostly satisfied and had a great time. The park itself is nicely themed and the rides are simply breathtaking. If you're an adrenaline junkie this is the place for you. That also means if you don't enjoy the extreme rides I would suggest somewhere else. The weather was fantastic and the most we queued the whole day was 45 minutes for X2 (before it broke down.... twice).A top tip would be to arrive early well before the park opening time. We arrived at 10am (30 minutes before the park opened) and still had to queue for over 30 minutes to get in meaning we lost time inside the park. The park doesn't have enough staff on the gates so a whole crowd of people is filtered down to four or so machines. Also if you have any multi attraction passes like we did make sure to visit the 'Will Call' booths first before queuing up otherwise you'll be turned away when at the turnstiles.Another tip is if you are travelling from Los Angeles you can easily get two buses to the park from North Hollywood metro station which cost $6 together. Search Santa Clarita 757 to McBean Transport Centre for more details. The park is a long way from Los Angeles so using a taxi should be avoided.The park does have a few problems though. One of them is the amount of rides closed or broken down. On the day we visited, a total of five rides were closed for the whole day including the extreme thrill rides. X2 broke down at least twice during the day and remained closed past the closing time with lines of people waiting. This isn't acceptable and although rides can break down I have never witnessed something on this scale regardless of what time of year. Planned ride closures are listed on the website and on the app but this needs to be looked into, perhaps more maintenance during closed hours is needed. Make sure that if you're coming for specific coasters or rides that they're not closed for 'refurbishment'.Also beware of taking bags onto the rides. The park operates a very strange loose articles policy where they ask you to pay for a locker but then when you make it onto some rides you can just leave your bag on the side for free. For some rides you have no choice but to pay for a locker. X2 is a prime example, there is only one queue so the people with no bags are stuck behind those purchasing lockers near the ride entrance. In comparison, Universal has a much better system where lockers are free for 2 hours which is fair considering that the majority of people will carry a bag for water and coats etc. This is all sorted before the ride entrance so no long queues while people wait to put bags in lockers.The food and drink is unsurprisingly expensive and the queues for food an drink can be long. We paid $30 for a pizza and one soda. We would've eaten elsewhere during the day but seeing french fries for $10 and bottles of coke at $4.50 is just too much. We didn't have any problems getting water and a sandwich inside the park as some people mention but the staff did open the bottle and smell inside.Overall a fantastic park for thrill seekers but apart from the rides there is a lot this place needs to work on. This park needs to improve on their ride maintenance because there's just too many rides closed.",TomC5991
10,Do Not go !!!!,We waited 90 minutes in line for food. Every ride was at least an hour with multiple rides closed. Way toooooo busy!!!!!!!,verchy1
40,X2 and Twisted Colossus!,"Haven't been here in 20 years. A lot has changed! My old favorite, Colossus, has had a major makeover, and I must say, it is better! It was my family's favorite ride...until we rode X2. OMG! That ride scared ME (and I am a veteran coaster rider). Coming here makes for a long day, so planning your day will help. We came on a weekday, which helped with the lines. We didn't get to ride Tantrus (?) and the New Revolution because they had mechanical trouble. That was disappointing, especially since we waited in lines only to be turned away. Would also recommend Full Throttle as a fun ride. Food was disappointing (and expensive), but it is an amusement park, so there it is. After all was said and done, we had a good day.",MrGodzilla
10,Discrimination,"If I could rate this place a zero I would. All day my family and I went on the most thrilling rides, including the Goliath three times. Now my dad has a prosthetic leg. On our very last ride of the day the man who was checking our seat belts saw my father's leg and told him, ""I'm sorry but I can't let you ride this ride."" Two of the workers there named Brett and Martin then proceeded to stop the entire ride and forced us to leave. My father's leg will not fly off. They could've pulled on it themselves and tested it. This wasn't even a ride where your legs hang off. We had been on many of those too, and guess what! His leg did not move at all. When we were publicly told to leave the man said that we should have picked up a manual at Guest Relations to check which rides are acceptable to go on with a prosthetic of any kind. Naturally my entire family marched straight over to the Guest Relations office and filed a complaint. We also picked up that nifty little handbook he took out. In the handbook it clearly states that you might be asked to remove your prosthetic for safety reasons. There is nothing saying that you will be asked to leave. We did not get the option for him to remove the prosthetic. We were only told to leave. That was so disrespectful I can't even explain the anger. My father has been to theme parks and places such as that his entire life. In 45 years Six Flags was the only place to discriminate. Congratulations on that title.",GabrielleClaassen
20,Expensive and Long Lines. Exceptional Coasters though.,"I was very excited to go to Magic Mountain with just my wife. I purchased my tickets online and purchased the GOLD flash pass. With parking, I was $300.00 deep for this trip.Here is the good.1. Coasters are spectacular. Twisted Colossus, X2, Tatsu, and Full Throttle probably topped my list, but was also impressed by the others I visited (Batman, Scream, Viper, Ninja).2. Park aisle ways and paths aren't overly crowded. Probably due to lack of strollers.Here is the bad.1. Security check and entry into the park is just flat out ridiculous, unfair, mismanaged, and poorly executed. If you show up between 9:30 and noon, you will be waiting around 45 minutes just to get into the place.2. If you purchase a flash pass in advance (or in person) you have to wait in another long line. It was laughable that Six Flags would make guests wait an additional 20 minutes (after waiting 30-45 to get in) to pay for a PREMIUM SERVICE INTENDED TO ALLOW ONE TO SKIP LINES! Just to get in and get our flash pass, we lost 1 hour (or 10% of our trip). Gone. Just like that!3. No food in the park. This is completely unacceptable. We purchased food in advance and had to run to our car just to eat.4. Flash Pass was misleading on some attractions. While it generally worked (allowing one to skip to front of the line), there were a few instances where the flash pass line was still 20-30 minutes deep. This lead me to believe Six Flags was renting out more flash passes than it is suppose to. With flash pass patrons waiting (you're not supposed to wait if you have flash pass), customers in the normal line were able to get priority.5. Lines. This has to have the worst collection of long lines in the entire theme park industry. Nearly every coaster was a 45 minute minimum.All said and done, we rode 10 coasters and the pirate ship ride. With the flash passes and cost of entry and parking, this was roughly 15 dollars per coaster per person, so I felt slightly ripped off (10 per person more equitable).",Spalding123
20,It was alright.,Honestly I wasn't that impressed. The layout of the park makes it hard to go to what you want to go to. The lines were crazy. I probably won't be going again.,Whitney T
30,Thrilling and Fun,We had a great time and were happy with most of the rides. The older areas of the park need to be maintained better and needs to be updated. Newer rides and park area were excellent. Food lines were super long but the food was good.,Randall R
40,Fun weekend at 6 flags MM,"Took my wife, son, and our friends daughter for a weekend to 6 flags. Overall it was a lot of fun. Especially enjoyed Goliath. There were rides for all sizes and tastes, which was nice since our friend's kid was not so sure about the coasters. The park is all about the rides, so not really heavily themed like Disneyland, but was still a nice place. Some issues with line cutting, and the staff at the dinning places while very pleasant, seemed somewhat overwhelmed and the lines seemed to be longer than they should. Lot of chances to do meet and greets with Loony Toons and DC characters.Decent mix of food choices. I think the meal pass is a pretty good bargain if you buy season passes. (Shame it can't be used on the Sushi place.)The only ride that I was able to go on, that I did not like was the River Rapids. Just a raft banging around a short whitewater track. No real theme, no anticipation, the operators also needed some practice, as they had to launch multiple rafts empty because they could not stop them at the loading point.Looking forward to our next trip.",Wesley R
40,Amazing roller coasters and attractions!,"They have the largest range of different rides you can go to compared to other amusement parks! The best for adults.The place is almost perfect, i think they just need little bit more details and organizing (I'm comparing to Europa park). Other than that its perfect.##ADVICE!!!##If your going on a weekend BUY the flash pass, its totally worth it, there are three kinds with three different prices, each cuts the waiting time for rides to a certain extent! The best is the platinum pass which cuts time for up to 90%. This is the one i got and its really awesome! If you do buy the flash pass then you can only chose one ride at a time on your flash device. The flash device will tell you when to go to you attraction (it will give you exact time, this tome does not expire). Once you get to the attraction your flash device will be scanned, once its scanned then immediately book your next attracting, this way you save even more time.Another important advice is to download their app! It made it super easy for me find rides with their app. It has everything! All the restaurants, attractions, shows, shops, information, and with one click it can tack you there with their map!Last but not least, remember where you park your car or otherwise you will be ending up like me, looking for my car for about 30 minutes!ENJOY",Omar-ALZaid
30,Friends free day,"While being season pass holders, but living 300 miles away. Saturday was great but it always surprises me at the way lines are handled. Roaring rapids is case in point as it was a 2+ hr wait because of poor loading and fast passes going to the front. On Sunday with free friends with passes the park was busy. It was also the wait at food lines as they were 20,30 or 40 deep. It would have been better management to add staff for increase visitors. Especially since an entire food area was closed for renovations. Ok venting ✅ done",Kerry L
50,"Amazing, thrill-filled day!","Great thrill-filled roller coasters to fill up the day with. Like any theme park there are lines but it was definitely quieter than some of the other California theme parks such as Disneyland, Universal and Knotts Berry Farm. We went on an organised tour which was handy, as it's a good bit further out than other theme parks. Lockers were available on site which was really convenient and they weren't too expensive to rent for the day. Really cannot sing the praises of the roller coasters here enough though! Had such a great day!",DarD92
50,Big Rides Big Fun,"Who can say anything bad about this spot, each year you can get an annual pass for both parks, MM and hurricane harbor, plus a parking pass and if you monitor your email they even offer a food pass for 39.99 includes snack and lunch but no drinks - there is not a park around with this Giant rides, need to pick some off times if you want to beat the lines",bill g
10,Great rides but poorly organized on-site and off-site,"Generally, I like the notion of Six Flags. The rides are great and there is potential there. Really enjoyed the Twisted Colossus and the Tatsu ride at night.It's just disappointing when you get there, queue for an hour without warning under the scorching hot sun, and queue about an hour or two for every other ride. The security check by the entrance could've been coordinated to go quicker - just go hire an extra attendant per queue. One reason why the rides are so slow, I observed, is that the attendants do not do their best to fill the rides, call for lone riders or couples. So while TONS of people queue for the front seats, the back seats are left ignored when they could have been very well used by those further back in the queue. 8 hours spent there, and we've only been on 6 rides.The more traumatic and disappointing experience for me was purchasing and dealing with the All Day Picture Pass. I was visiting family here in California and I wanted to have access to all the fun shots from the rides. Did I get any of the photos I paid for? Two, at best. Great deal for $30 (not). I diligently had my card scanned at each post, but after 24 hours of the initial wait for photos to load, I only got TWO of them. Now I followed-up with Six Flags about this the next day, thinking I had plenty of time to recuperate all the photos (a month) - I was wrong. Even after I described our entry to each ride, even with a photo reference of the group, I got perhaps an email or two saying they would follow-up, but they never did, even after I bugged them for a whole month on this. I am SO disappointed, it has taken me months to muster myself to write this and deal with the rip-off. If you're considering getting the Picture Pass, skip it and take your own photos, maybe even take photos of the official photos, because I really doubt you'll get your money's worth within or outside of the park.",Rachel N
50,It's all about the rides,"Have been to Magic Mountain twice - if you love roller coasters you gotta go here. Be aware that unlike Disney, these rides are really for bigger kids and teens and those adults who are adrenaline junkies.",Patrick M
50,Go on a cool day,"Biggest complaint about MM? Lines are long and it is hot. Well, choose an off-season day if you can, go right to your top picks before long lines form, wear sun block and a hat, and have fun!!",love i
10,Not worth the visit nor the money,"If you want to spend all day in some sort of line, than this is the place for you! We arrived around 1100 am on a Sunday, it took over an hour to enter the park! First there is a line to walk through the medal detectors! Than you have to make another line to enter the gates of the park! Upon entering there were long lines for the rides as expected, However the shocking thing was how long the lines for food and to buy a drink are.. Very long lines not worth it as you probably need two to three concurrent days to ride everything due to the lines! Plus don't show up on an empty stomach, Very disorganized, All theme parks are crowded but this one is the worst at handling the crowds! Food is super expensive as expected! We didn't buy any because well the lines were extremely long",Cesar G
20,"Research and common sense told me to stay away, so we went....","We got there early, since we already had it on our agenda. The website, Isitpacked.com, had earlier shown it as ""Hey, it's alright"" for today, but last night we discovered that it had been changed to forecast ""Yup, it's packed"". Reluctantly, we went. We had researched ways to navigate the park and were there for opening (10:30 AM today). Also, The Six Flags website recommended saving time by purchasing the parking online... which we did for an extra service charge. It saved no time whatsoever, so that was money down the drain (only $2, though), as it would have made do difference if we had just paid at the toll station to the parking. We made good time getting on X2 and Viper, then it seemed that half the rides were not operating today... so long lineups formed quickly. While in line for Tatsu, the coaster that we really went for, an announcement commented that it was having operating problems and suggested that people could leave or wait awhile. We left, then went on a useless ride (Ninja), after wandering past 5 others that were shut down, then returned to Tatsu, only to find that the 10-minute wait had now become 2 hours, as everyone suddenly appeared there (due to so many other rides in that part of the park being shut down). Our daughter was done after 3 rides, and moped along with us as we waited for 2 hours to go on a water ride (she sat it out), then we were able to do one ride by going through the single rider line. This single rider thing is a joke, since only 4 rides offer it. Lineups for food were ridiculous. We left by 3:30, after having on only 5 rides and my kids (teenagers) commented that it was the worst park that they had aver been to. It seemed poorly co-ordinated, rides didn't seem as well automated or organized as they are at Universal and Disney, and the trill of Six Flags was quickly extinguished. We thought that Canada's Wonderland was crazy, but this makes the lineups there seem like express lines! Admittedly, this place probably has among the best collections of roller coasters anywhere, but if one can't enjoy them, then what's the point. Very disappointing all around. Our first and last visit to a Six Flags (someone else said that, too). Sorry.",5gordons

40,Great for the hour we were there,"Getting here was easy no issues from the freeway into the park. The lines to get in were long however that's to be expected. The wait for the trolley to take you to the park is a good 10 minutes from the time the last bus leaves but it seems so much longer in the sun. Once you get on the bus it's a smooth ride getting to the park. The lines to get into the park are crazy and I have been to several Six Flags. It was so hot outside my youngest son fainted, there were a couple off young ladies that helped with providing water to him. The EMT that looked him over and was really nice about it, probably because I looked like I was gonna start bawling right there. We didn't get to enjoy the park but it looked nice just very packed. I was surprised I didn't see any water sprayers with how hot it was .",luvtravel06

50,Greatest thrill rides,"If you are tired of the mellow Disneyland rides, head to Magic Mountain. They have tons of thrill rides and some of the greatest coasters anywhere. Yes, it's expensive like all amusement parks and it is very hot in summertime. Go when it's cooler weather if possible. Also call ahead and make sure all rides are running. The ""x"" was broken the last two times we visited. The lines are expectedly long and you need to stay hydrated. Be there when doors open to race in and go on the rides you have scouted out online. Right before closing the lines are short as well. If you are swueemish or get motion sickness easily, avoid this park. Make sure your kids are tall enough to ride the attractions before you go. This park is perfect for teens. Make sure you grab a funnel cake there as well. It's a tradition. If you want high, fast, twisting and turning entertainment you need to go to Magic Mountain. It's North of Los Angeles maybe 25 miles.",Mudsharkrocks

30,A necessary day of fun & thrills on our road trip,"Ever since planning our road trip my 15 yo sons's only request was a theme park day so to satisfy his love of rollercoasters we chose Six Flags Magic Mountain. As this was a once in a lifetime opportunity we paid for the platinum flash pass, just for 2, I suffer motion sickness, so will only go on a few rides. I think it's great that you pay an entrance fee (which is fairly reasonable) and then just pay extra for those who want to skip lines, you can just pass the device to whomever wants to use it. It being a Sunday in early August it was necessary to have the flash pass, otherwise we'd have spent the whole day cueueing.Buy a drinks cup for approx 15USD you can get free refills of soft drinks all day, definitely worth it for a family that's happy to share a drink.The park is a little shabby and lacks the charm of Disney and Universal but it is all about the rides.Twisted Colossus was declared the best ride of the day.",Sam R
30,"Disneyland it is not, but...","Having grown up with a Disney childhood, I admit that I am spoiled. When it comes to theme/amusement parks, no one does it better than Disney. For years I have been harshly judging other parks for their less than ideal attention to detail and customer satisfaction, so each time I visit a non-Disney park I look for things I'd fix. To me staff/cast courtesy, cleanliness, maintenance, value and overall satisfaction matter. Magic Mountain has some awesome coasters and an adequate kids area, but here are what I'd be mindful of as a guest, and Six Flags can use this as constructive criticism.1) Repairs. There are things that simply need fixing, cleaning and updating. The gate by the railroad has peeling paint. Walkways are not clean. Many rides look tired and in need of refreshing.2) Annual Pass. After you buy your annual pass, you must enter a shed where they process your papers and give you a pass. Slow, unfriendly, crowded and overall a bad first park experience.3) Friendliness. The staff was not overly friendly, courteous or interested in providing a ""wow"" experience.",globalandlocaltravel
10,Poor service ruins trip,"In Feb of '17 our family visited the park. We arrived on a Saturday only to find the park closed because of weather which is understandable but there was no notification on the website. The next day we stood in line for an hour to even pick up our tickets at the ""will call"" desk. They had way too few workers getting people into the park. The park was very crowded with very long wait lines. Compared to other parks who allow visiters to pick up ""fast pass"" tickets and return to rides 6 flags does a very poor job. We will not be returning to 6 flags again.",Brent K
40,Come for the thrills not the ambiance,"We came here knowing the reason we came was for the thrill rides. If you love thrill rides then come for sure. There are multiple roller coasters that are an absolute blast to ride. If you are expecting any kind of Disney or universal studios type quality park then this isn't the park for you. I gave this rating based on it offering exactly what I wanted which was rides. The bathrooms were dirty and smelly, and the food lineups were borderline ridiculous (an hour to get a burger at Johnny rockets and about 25 minutes to get a churro from a vendor). We used the flash pass which was expensive but in our mind worth it so we didn't have to spend all day standing in lineups. Overall it was a pretty expensive day but we had a ton of fun.",helena218
30,"Expensive, but can cut costs with planning","I hadn't been to this park, and my boys really wanted to go, so we did, despite the weather. I highly recommend you do your homework on line and purchase your tickets before arriving to save time and money. If you think you'll go back again this year then get the annual pass. If you're feeding allot of people, and will be there for a couple of days then get the food pass. If souvenirs are your thing, get the shopping pass. We found the fast pass system to be pricey, but if you're there in the summer with huge crowds you should consider it.",TheGolfWanderer

40,It's all about the rides - for better or worse,"The location of the amusement park is very easy to find and it lays only 45-60 minutes away from Los Angeles. Very convenient. We took our car (did not see any alternative transportation available) and we were conveniently ushered to a free parking space by an employee. We had bought our tickets before and recommend everybody to do so. It makes the process of queuing quicker. There will be some waiting if you arrive just before the opening so be ready to amuse and occupy eventual children! We had also bought a flash pass that lets you queue in one line while you are in another. The device beeps when it's your turn and you can then just make your way to the flash pass line and enter the ride. The flash pass was quite expensive but if your only coming here once it's worth it!Some negative sides: The park is mainly focused on the rides and there are some nice places to eat but not so many to just hang out. The interior is ok but I've seen far better parks that add to the magical atmosphere of being at a amusement park. One negative thing was the short opening hours. You need to plan this visit well!Overall a great visit, but once is quite enough!",Edvin B

In the 5 hours we were there we completed 3 rides. 6 were not operational before we even entered. One even broke down while we were on it!! After spending 50 for lunch 60 on an uber one way and next to no rides operating we decided to go to customer service to complain. After 30 mins we gave up waiting!

50,Awesome place,Six flags in Santa Clarita California is one of my favorite places in the world however you must go on a weekday to truly enjoy it. Weekends are not advised. The food isn't that good but that don't take away from the experience. If u love thrills this place has em I purchase an annual pass every year. It's the best deal the workers are cool and friendly and the rides are simply the best. Enjoy and have fun,Joey S

The park was mostly empty so we got to go on more rides, but a few things shut down bc of the weather including many of the restaurants. The staff was mostly friendly.

40,"Great, but expensive!","We visited here Sunday 15th January. We paid for our 2 teenagers to upgrade to the gold pass which was expensive but a smart move. The kids managed to get on every ride and then on their favourites again! The best ride of the day was Twisted Colossus by far. The queues were not too long and overall it was a great day! My overall complaints were the park tickets were costly, we paid an additional amount to upgrade passes, we had to pay extra to go on the Go Karts plus $50 for additional cost for the large swing. A slice of pizza is $10 and a bottle of water is $4.50! By the end of the day I had spent just over $700 Australian Dollars (After checking my Credit Card) and we did not eat in the park all day due to the cost. We had a brilliant time but it's way too expensive for a second visit when we return to the US.",DeannaV17
40,Don't buy fast pass until you get there!,"I have wanted to go to this park all my life (and I'm now 47) so being here was a dream come true.Having been at Universal the day before, which was packed, I was surprised to see the park relatively empty.My mistake was buying a platinum fast track pass the night before for $115 per person and then getting to the park and realising that the longest queue was about 30 minutes.The platinum pass doesn't include X2, so we paid another $15, only to be told right after buying the additional ticket that the wait time was only 6 minutes.This really annoyed me, surely the staff member serving us might have acknowledged the fact that we had already paid for an expensive flash pass and let us know that additional ticket was not necessary.This just appeared to be an opportunity for the park to grab more money.Whether it was the staff member not using his initiative or the parks training method but it soured the day.Having said that, this park has some amazing coasters. Twisted Colossus was the highlight. This is one incredibly fast hybrid coaster and we loved it.There were quite a few coasters closed but we still had a great time.Staff operating the rides were efficient.We had a great day only slightly ruined by the fact we had spent so much on the unnecessary flash pass.If the place is busy, the flash pass would be worth its weight in gold. But quiet days, it's a clear waste of money.Don't buy the pass until you get there.",jp0069

50,I Love Rollercoasters!,"I really love this place and have been here a few time. This place is a roller coaster fanatics dream. I would generally recommend this amusement park for ages ten and up. Not much to do for young children who are scared of roller coasters, or too short to ride most. However, this might be a different case when the water park is open. I was disappointed to see that four of the roller coasters were not running on the day we went. The New Revolution ride was also a disappointment. It is a great idea incorporating virtual reality with a roller coaster, however the video wasn't really in sync with the coaster and didn't line up properly. I really loved the Twisted Colossus coaster and think it may be my new favourite. It's so fun to battle against another coaster and the ride is long enough that you feel you get to go twice. I have always found the bathrooms lacking at this park. The men's bathroom when you immediately get into the park has been remodelled, however there are only two urinals and one stall. This is not large enough as an entrance bathroom for an amusement park of this size. Overall I love this park and the amount and variety of roller coasters here. My favourites include X2 (wish the fire effect was back), Tatsu, Apocalypse, Full Throtle, Goliath, and definitely the Twisted Colossus. Buy your tickets online ahead of time to get a deal. This place is one of my favourites and is quite reasonable for a full day at an amusement park, especially compared to other amusement parks in the area, however if you're not a fan of roller coasters or water parks then I wouldn't recommend it.",jermwall
10,Bad investment,"We are from Brazil and during our vacation time through the California in late December 2016, my family and I decided to visit Six Flags Magic Mountain for the first time. The park was full but not crowded. At the entrance, after a long line to the metal detector, we discovered that we could not get food in the park. For food I say a couple of packages of M&M and a bottled water. The attendant told us that we could return to the car to leave the ""food"" there or throw them away. Why were there no warnings in the parking lot about it? ""Leave your food and water in the car! You will not be able to enter the park with them!!!"" The option was to throw them away (we walked almost a mile!!!). We saw people dropping fresh fruit and their own bottles of water. After that, at the entrance to the park, we figure it out: They were selling a bottled water for $ 4.50!!! Are you kidding me?We had plans to visit several attractions but even in the morning, some attractions were not working and in others the queues were disorganized. The average wait time was 2 hours for the first roller coaster (Goliath). Hungry, we tried a quick snack and my wife ordered a hot dog without chilli. The attendant replied that it was not possible and placed chilli in her hot dog. I did not ask to pay less for the food. I just asked not to put chilli ... We went on a second roller coaster (Full Throttle) after an hour wait just because it was under maintenance and had just opened when we passed in the area. Finally, our daughters wanted to ride the ""The New Revolution"" roller coaster. At the queue's arrival there was a sign stating that the wait time was two hours. We got in line and after 3 hours there were still a lot of people ahead. Tired and discouraged we ended up giving up the queue and leaving the park. After a full day we were able to take a ride on only two roller coasters. A big disappointment. Could be worth it for locals, with seasonal or annual passes. For us it wasn't.",Mauricio Machado
30,Awful queues and waits.,"The Park has no queue management system at entry to speak of. It took over two hours just to get in. No identifiable staff to ask what queue to wait in, where to exchange tickets etc.Once inside, we have bought flash passes to jump queues and they made the day a lot better. By evening though, even these were giving 45-60 min waits. Without spending the extra $180, our experience of the park would have been awful. So it works out a very very expensive way to enjoy the park. By evening too, despite seeming to be less busy, the wait time was longer. On one ride, there was no staff to manage to queuing, making me wonder if staff numbers fall in the evening?? It was so bad I tweeted the park to say 'guys, it's chaos and maybe a little dangerous'. (I got no response).Ride choice - great. Some scary thrills. The lights and evening music at Christmas were good and added to the atmosphere.",Yucca1
40,Great place for family fun,"I took my nephew's to six flags in the summer, it was great, we had so much fun.If you don't want to wait in lines all day, get the platinum pass,, it helped a lot, we could hop on and off most rides whenever we wanted.Platinum pass sometimes restricts different rides on different days, we could only ride the superman once, when I visited a few years ago, you could go as many times as you wanted with the platinum pass, which is not cheap and this time only one go which was disappointing.The park should offer more healthy food options rather than junk food everywhere.",JaredMcCulloch
40,"If you're a ""Local"" it's totally worth it","A few tips, get there prior to opening and head to the biggest rides first, you'll be able to ride 5+ of them before the lines start getting to long, which they do. The lines get very long. Grab a room at a nearby hotel, spend 10:30-2 at the park then head out and do something else nearby, stay the night and comeback the next day for another 10:30-2.

10,DON'T GO!,We were there for 7 hours and only managed to go on 2 rides. The lines were ridiculously long and 6 of the rides were broken and not working. THey were not offering any refunds or exchange passes. It was just horrendous.,panamama
10,They don't do maintenance,"Drove 1100 miles...overnight...been here all day. Rode two roller coasters, everything they have is broken! Maintain your equipment!",toes398
50,Prettiest Park hands down,"I grew up near Cedar Point but this place beats the lake views easily. The mountain isn't that steep or difficult of a walk and it's gorgeous with tons of trees lining the park. And whomever said it's a long walk from the parking lot probably needs to visit more parks. This is a shorter walk than the one in Vallejo at Discovery Kingdom. This park is much cleaner too and they pipe music throughout the park so it has a more Disney-like feel to it. There's an app you can get to give you the ride times - I recommend it as the lines seem longer here than in other parks (2 hours for the top rides before 12n - wow). Meanwhile, less popular rides had no lines at all which was great.",Debbie L
50,If you love coasters.. this is for you!,"We bought season passes, and even though it is a 2-3 hour drive from our house, we have gone 3 times in the past 30 days! The only negative is the bathrooms are always NASTY.",xanaduyas
50,Amazing Time with my Family,"After we purchased the Flash Pass (a lot extra) we had an excellent time!! We were able to go on every ride and coaster. If you like really fast, fun rides this is the place!! I have teenage boys so they didn't want to stop! We closed the park!! The holiday lights were unbelievable. So beautiful!",Kathy C

50,Favorite Six Flags in the US,"Magic Mountain does not disappoint. Been here multiple times and decided to go back since our road trip from SF swung near Valencia. Had to make this stop since we had our season passes too. Get here early, hit the big rides first before they get packed. Our favorite has to be X2. There's no other one like it. It's the best here. Worth the wait.We love the kiddie area too. Concentrated in one area but so many different rides for youngsters who are timid to more daring ones. The cutest one is Tweeties Cage one where they go into a personal cage and it swings around. Very unique. Little coasters everywhere and go pretty fast.Carousel is nice here. Accessible pics with the characters throughout the day.Love the DC Universe area. Lol Batman was Robin but cute pics with him. Alot of fun here for my kids. Got to buy capes. Wonder woman ride is crazy but my little one loved it. Dizzying.Their bumper cars are actually pretty fun here. They give you lots of time to drive around. We came on a great day. Weekday early summer. So not too crowded at all. Nice weather.Lex Luther Drop of Doom was actually pretty high and big. Unlike any other drops in other parks. Superman is a must here too.Highly advise buying season meal deal passes. So worth it to at least get one for your family to eat lunch, snack or dinner to carry you over until you can eat out. We ate lunch at Twisted Wiches after reading reviews and was pleasantly surprised that it was pretty good. Fresh ingredients and quite big. Fed our whole family with the family pack. Only downside is that they have chairs outside with only a few with umbrellas so it got hot under some without them.This park is so big. On a non busy day you can do almost everything but if you want to relax, you can take 2 days. Each ride is so worth it.Highly recommend a visit here if you have passes. Best six flags!",livelovex7
40,Great Park!--with downsides,"Visiting Six Flags Magic Mountain is a must if you're in the area. Everyone will love it's great roller coaster lineup and wide range of restaurants. One of the best restaurants is Chop Six. It serves some of the best Chinese food I've ever had! As far as roller coasters go, this is the best establishment for a thrill. The rides are astonishing and while it may be extra, it's worth it to pay for the flash pass. If you're up for the thrills, make sure to go on X2, Twisted Colossus, and Full Throttle. There is a huge downside though. There are hardly any restrooms and the lines can get very long. The women's restrooms in particular were very dirty and lines could take up to 15 minutes. With that set aside, this park is so incredible and great for anyone!",Alyssa C
40,"Great Coaster Lineup, not so good Bathroom Lineup.","I went to Six Flags Magic Mountain for 1 1/2 Days with my family. I purchased the Flash Pass which was very helpful for getting on all of the coasters. All of the coasters were great. The bathrooms on the other hand were dirty and the women's bathroom lines were long. Other than that, our family had a great time at our the park.",Evan C
20,"Started ok, but fell apart at the end.","We got there a half hour after it opened. There was a huge slow moving line to get in for no apparent reason. We got on to the Goliath pretty quickly, but it was downhill from there. The next 3 major rides we tried to go on were closed. The nest two rides we tried to get on had 3+ hour lines. We got to ride the ninja after an hour wait, then ate an overpriced lunch. The next coaster we waited for had a 3 hour wait and broke down twice while in line. We tried to get a snack, but by 7 they were out of pretzels at one place. The next place was out of nachos, coke, and ice. Some rides were only running 1 car instead of two.the whole place felt understaffed and unprepared. The rides we went on were fun, but for 80 a ticket it should have been a lot better.",Matt O
50,I love 6 flags!!,"I've been to L.A four times before and every time I go to six flags. Their are long lines there so we buy the front of the line pass. ( trust me it's worth it) to go here you have to love roller coaster because every roller coaster is upside down. ( unless you go to the kitty land) The food is over priced but what do you expect for a amusement park. If your gonna be in L.A go here it's way better than Disney land or universal studios, but it's not a place for young kids.",Oshea_1013
20,Minor delays and infinite queues,"""Minor delays"" and 1+ hour queues seemed to be the standard on the day we went. They didn't bother announcing any waiting times so it was a gamble. For constructive critique; maybe on the way out there could be a Refund building, where disappointed guests could queue to complain their $80 back?",Victor
10,ABSOLUTE JOKE!!,"We went here Boxing Day, while traveling on holiday from the UK, we were a party of six.Due to the holiday season we expected it would be busy... Clearly the management of Six Flags did not!Arrived 5 mins after opening and waited inline for two security checks for 1hr 10 mins!!!!Ok, wasn't too bothered about that as its reassuring that safety comes first but more staff were definitely needed!To sum the whole day up:Rides amazing but waiting times ridiculously long 2hrs, 90 mins etc etc40 minutes to order a drink at walk up services same or more for food that you would even feed your dog!10/15 mins wait each & every filthy woman's toilet we had the unfortunate need to use!Staff are incredibly thick and slow (understatement)We have been to Disney & Universal many times and it would be wise if Six Flags took note on how to run a theme park efficiently, hygienically, gave value for money when it comes to food quality & service!We spent good money on tickets & Q jump devices but we will never return, complete shambles, run down, unorganised hell hole. I have never witnessed Q's like it for every possible service needed by the consumer!Good Luck!",Shaymax
50,Fun at Magic Mountain,"Always love traveling through LA and stopping at Magic Mountain. Twisted Colossus was outstanding, we rode it a few times, with 3 cars going lines went really fast. Going during the week on holiday break is the best way to go.",928bernard
50,"It's FANTASTIC, but . . .",It's great. It's fantastic. It's one of the last great thrill-ride destinations in the 'States and if you're within easy drive well worth a day trip and get the Flash Pass . . .but . . .Don't bother with any of the pictures. HUGE rip-off. Oh yes - they get your moment of terror-face - but photoshopped all around is a whole load of unrelated material. If you want to download the pix via the internet you need to give up a whole load of personal information (my address ? for why ?). Really disappointing . . .,smcara
40,Great Fun,"This is the park that everyone should go too, so much better than Disney if you have teenagers. This place is brilliant, 19 roller coasters. It gets busy late afternoon, get there early.",MVP66
50,Holiday in the Park time,"We had been wanting to go and decided that in December before Christmas would be a good time. We arrived 30 min before the doors opened and there was a ton of people in line. As soon as they opened we went in and the crowd spread out. It really wasn't packed at all (even though it looked like it would be). The lines for the kiddie rides were 15mins. At night the park was lite up with lights and there was even a 'snow' machine. It was really nice and I got to take some cool pictures. The forecast said 58 degrees and it was chilly but not to bad. At night, yes it was COLD but we were having fun and the kids had a great time.",Magaliv86
50,Amazing park to visit if you are found of roller coasters.,"We loved the aprk, amazing place for those who enjoy the excitement of roller coasters. It is a must if you are ver in the area of Los Angeles.",Flavia Tafner
40,Magic Mountain,"We visited on Sunday, at the start of most kids holiday break. It was cold, and the park was not crowded, but many rides were only running one car/track, so still an hour + wait for the major rides. The roller coasters are extreme, pure adrenaline and ideal for thrill seekers, teenagers and the truly fearless preteens (54 inches is the minimum height for the biggest rides). There are limited options for the younger kids.However...I've been to amusement parks across the US and in several other countries; Magic Mountain is the dirtiest park I've visited. Trash, dried gum, diapers, spilled food, sticky liquids are all throughout the park. Run down restrooms, several with one or more toilets malfunctioning-- unpleasant. It's mostly young people running the park, with a laid back attitude that can be interpreted as poor customer service at times.Overall, my family and I enjoyed some incredible rides. We'd go back, just with extra hand sanitizer next time. I'd also recommend looking in to the quick entry pass - at over an hour in line per ride, it might be worth the investment to get an extra 5-7 rides in with the time you save.",Julie H
50,Adrenaline pumping and heart pumping day!!!!,"Had a great time here, because im a great roller coater addict!Went there on a sunday there were not much people.I only get to try some of the rides not all, because a lot of the rides were close :(I recommend this to those who love adventure. Try GOLIATH, TATSU, TWISTED COLOSSUS!Staff are friendly and very helpful. The only thing i do not like is that during the rides they dont maximize the seat rides, thats why i feel the lines were so long....",delie dell C
50,Greatest day ever!,Being a theme park lover we were so excited and it was so much better then we expected. Being low season the park was extremely quiet so we had no waiting on any ride. 1 ride scared us immensely but the rest were awesome! Open one in Australia with those kind of rides!!,mthornton84
50,Christmas fun,"Wow! My first time to visit Holliday in the park. Better than I expected. During the day time it's just so so with plenty of decorations but nothing to get you too worked up about. Then when the sun goes down and they turn on the lights, bam! A Christmas wonderland, so impressive with fake snow, lots of crazy characters and good entertainment. For someone like me who lives in a cold climate area I got all this plus 60 degrees! How can you beat that.oh and by the way, real snow is overated.",Jeff G
50,Flash pass is a must,"We do not live close to the park. On the way for a college visitation tour we visited the park and reserved a fast pass platinum. This is an absolute must. Yes it is more expensive but if you don't live close so as to visit the park repeatedly I strongly recommend the pass. Here is the trick though. As soon as you get past the booth where they check your pass you then make a reservation for the next ride. We rode 13 different coasters during the busy summer in six hours so if you do the math, we didn't stand in line. Please remember that time included the ride itself and walking between rides. Again yes more expensive but if you are only going to visit the park once then why would you choose to just stand in line.",Jim Gress
40,You can't get this anywhere else,"Six flags is a nice mixture of awesome rides, TONS of ads, and interesting food. 19 roller coasters and an awesome membership program, you can't beat that. Stay the same six flags, stay the same with your ads on every corner!",Nora0921
50,December is the best,"Six Flags magic mountain is what amusement parks are supposed to be like in terms of coasters. Every ride is a thrill, and in the first week of December the lines were 5 to 10 minutes for most of the day. It picked up around 4pm, with line waits extending to an hour or less, but we took advantage of the slow morning and got our money's worth and then some. One warning: the lap belts on twisted colossus are TINY. My wife (who is curvy but NOT overweight) was unable to ride, which was too bad because I sat on the front car and it was easily the best coaster I've ever been on.Lastly, might I suggest eating at JB's Barbecue. Delicious!",AustWhit
40,Six Flags,Many of the rides were closed for maintenance. Kept turning us away from some of the most popular ones. The holiday lights were pretty awesome. Made for great pictures.,Carla Julieta B
30,Season Pass scam,"Beware that if you buy the Black Friday/Cyber week Season Pass, and you want all the things they state you'll get for the season/year: like Free Parking, or Free Upgrade to Gold Pass, YOU MUST VISIT THE PARK BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR (current situation for me is 2016) and pick up your new Season Pass OR YOU DO NOT get these benefits. This was stated at the very bottom of all the wonderful things they say you'll get if you purchase the season pass. This is completely misleading since it is not stated in the lead/top paragraph nor in the bullet points of what you supposedly get by making this cyber week purchase. So for our family it was not worth buying cause we live out of state and only planned on visiting the park twice, so the savings is gone, since we now will have to pay for parking (which is $20/per car). We do not plan on visiting the Hurricane Harbor either. They should put this stipulation in BOLD within the very first PARAGRAPH, not at the bottom mixed between things. I called withing 48hrs of purchasing and found this out by chance and asked for a refund and cancellation of my online purchase but they would not do that. Nor did they even offer me a voucher for free parking. Very deceptive advertising in my opinion!!",Tucladyfun42
40,Great roller-coasters,"Magic Mountain offers the best lineup of rollercoasters I have ever seen at an amusement park. Like any amusement park lines can sometimes be long, but a lot of these rollercoasters are worth the wait. My personal favorites are X2, Twisted Colossus, Tatsu, Scream, and Goliath but there are so many rides you can choose from. The biggest frustration with Magic Mountain is the long walk from the parking lot to the entrance; they should have two entrances to the park, or move the entrance closer to their parking lot. The park itself is a little dated and not as clean as other amusement parks and its food options could be improved, but if all you care about is the rides then this is the amusement park for you.",Scott B
30,Ok amusement park,"First of all I don't like amusement parks.This one was probably ok, shuttle buses to and from the parking. Most rides open Sunday evening.Stiff prices for food and plastic toys etc etc.A little tough on the length of kids, but that's not surprising in the USA.",Putte
50,Fun time!,"This place has something for all the family, if it's been a while since you were here they have ""cleaned up"" the place a little and don't put up with the crap they use to put up with! Fun time for the older ones and a area for the little ones.",Rob B
40,"lines are fast to rides, difficult on holidays","This is an awesome place for riding, specially thrill rides.Other rides are also fun, What I like the most is Halloween and Christmas there.

10,Stuck upside down on a ride!!,"I went to Six Flags with my younger cousin his friend and the friend's Dad. We were having an decent time, however, we had to queue for over an hour just to get a pizza and then when ordered it took a further 25 mins to arrive and to top it off, my cousin and I got stuck upside down on a ride for over 15 minute! People were screaming, yelling and panicking and when we finally got off we weren't offered any explanation, comfort or assistance. We went and complained, which we had to stand in line for another half an hour. The lady took our report and didn't offer any compensation besides another ride, however, we WERN'T risking going on anymore of their rides. We said we were shaken, thirsty and tired, so she gave us a drink voucher and told us that someone would be in contact with us about this incident, however almost 6 months later we HAVEN'T heard anything from them. It is very scary to think how dangerous their rides are and they have no concern for our safety.",Legend

50,"Popular Spot for Tourists and Locals, MUST Love RollerCoasters.","The primary draw of the park is the number of its impressive roller coasters, which can most effectively be enjoyed with a Gold flash pass.In Southern California, this park has the most numerous, and highest quality roller coasters.Guests come from all over the world to see the worlds fastest & biggest looping coaster Full Throttle.The park is very big and you want to familiarize yourself with the map before wandering around, and utilize the Helpful Honda Express to get up the central hill in the park.Nearly every day they have costumed characters, Batman, Wonder Woman, Wiley Coyote & Daffy Duck available for free photographs you can take yourself.Food & Drink are expensive for tourists & non pass holders, $20 for a refillable drink and $15 for each meal at restaurants. There is a variety of food, including Chinese restaurant, fish, Mexican, chicken wings, hot dogs, cheeseburgers, & a BBQ Grill.I have tried ALL of them and they are all hearty and edible. It is gourmet food, especially the desserts.Without purchasing a Flash Pass lines are usually 2-3 hours for all good rides.A Gold Flash pass ($85 / day) has typical wait times of 45 minutes - 1 hour when the park is busy, and significantly less during off-peak days (and you don't have to stand in line).It is common to see tourists from Russia, Middle-East, Japan & Western Europe, in addition to local Californianos, mostly Hispanic & non-Hispanic white families",John H
50,What an Amazing day! So Many rides!,Now this is a place you must do if you like thrill rides! And I definitely recommend buying a fast pass because you won't get through all the rides otherwise. Twisted colossus was my favorite ride followed by the x2. Ninja and green lantern were painful rides and also apocalypse was super fast and hurt as well. Food was pretty good. We also were there during frightfest and did some mazes and they were pretty cool.,Shannii
50,AWESOME!,"I LOVE MM!! I have been several times, and it just keeps getting better. The BEST ride is X2--absolutely amazing ride with incredible views. Food is great, ticket prices are great, atmosphere is great, this is the best six flags I've been to!! Only con: the lines are long. But you'll get through it, and you can meet people in the line! Recommend to anyone, any age!!!",Christina_DiMauro
40,Great rides at a reasonable price,"MM is a contender for Coaster Capital of the World. Tied with Cedar point, MM has great rides not available anywhere else, like X2 and Tatsu.Rides can be down too often, and food lines are long and prices are sky high, but the fact remains that you can't beat the rides here.The kiddy area is good, even though the theming is starting to get weak.",CoasterFamily2016
30,Awesome ruined by poor management,"We adore theme parks and finally were able to tick Six Flags Magic Mountain off our bucket list. The best is Colossus the white wooden one that my husband practically forced me to sit in the front car of - totally terrifying! There are many other excellent rides. However the park, which to our surprise, is only open Friday-Sunday does not seem to reinvest its high ticket prices in cleanliness nor in basic management. I never saw a female restroom with more than 7 cubicles (compare that to 13+ for the smallest ones at Knotts Berry Farm) nor found one without chipped tiles and dirty floors. However we were gobsmacked there was a 3-hour wait for hamburgers Etc at Johnny Rockets with a further 45-minute wait at the pizza place.",visitrequisites
40,Great fun for older kids and young-at-heart adults (in good shape!),Always a blast. But lines are always long. A lot of walking. Plenty of parking but a pain to wait for shuttle.,Stacey7755
30,JROTC Fun Day,"The park is growing but the lines are getting ridiculous. Love the park, but 2 hour wait for a 1 min ride? My cadets loved it, and the security is a lot better. My only low rating is because when they released the Goblins, some of them were scaring way too many young kids, they will probably never sleep again.",Opie T
50,Skipped The Lines - Went for the Platinum Flash Pass w/ X2 - TOTALLY WORTH IT!!!,"This park is all about the roller coasters. It has some of the best coasters my family and I have ever been on, BUT it has LONG lines to get on the coasters. We had bought the regular passes and upon arriving at the park (10:15am) went straight to the X2 where we were told it was a 2-1/2 hour wait!!! My wife and I both looked at each other and we knew we were thinking the same thing... Let's go back and get a Flash Pass. So we headed back to get our passes and found out that in order to skip the line on the five best coasters in the park, you have to go for the top Flash Pass (the Platinum) for a hefty $130 per person, PLUS if you want to skip the line on the top new ride, the X2, you have to add an additional $15 per person. At first, I was shell shocked at the price, but we felt it would be worth it to skip the lines so we put down the Visa and went for it. We marched back up to X2 and within 10 minutes we were on the ride!!! After that first skip the line experience, we both said ""The extra cost was totally worth it""!!! We proceeded to hit EVERY coaster in the park (15 total) AND got on the front row of each coaster, with the longest wait was about 15 minutes and ONLY because we wanted the front row. It was a long day (started at 10:30am and ended at 8pm), and put on over 20,000 steps according to my Apple Watch. If we hadn't got the Platinum pass, we would only have been able to hit 6 or 7 of these coasters due to the long lines. We had originally planned on two days at the park, but with the Platinum pass, we decided one long day was enough and the savings of not going the second day could be applied against the additional cost of the Platinum pass.Our recommendation: Buy the Platinum Flash Pass w/ X2 and plan on one long day full of exhilarating coaster rides. We are confident that after skipping the line on the X2 and all other coasters, you'll have the same opinion... It was totally worth it!!!",Davis McGregor
30,Great coasters but not much else,"The day started with a long wait for parking. As a pass holder with early entrance, I know to be there early. I thought an hour early would be fine, but we were stuck in parking traffic. Our passes which allow early entry don't allow early entry past security. That whole fiasco put us inside the park at 11:00. Two hours of waiting. 😡. Thankfully we had a fast pass, so we were able to ride a bunch of coasters. Unfortunately, the restaurants were very understaffed. Lunch took almost two hours for a slice of pizza and two sandwiches. And let's not even discuss the cleanliness of the bathrooms. We used a lot of hand sanitizer. This is our second visit. I'm not sure we'll renew the passes for 2017. We may try Universal or Disney. Both are cleaner, more friendly staff and have better line flow.",FarAway580183
50,It´s all about roller coasters!,"A must-go if you like emotion and adventure. It´s more for adults or teenagers, but I saw some brave kids there. I tried only the most exciting roller coasters and my favorite was X2, really extreme! They offer discount for military.",Cynthia R
20,Extremely Disappointed in the upkeep,"I've been going to Magic Mountain for over 28 years. I was there the day of the riots and never went back after that until 6 years ago when I took my kids for the first time. I was 15 when the riots happened and it scared me to death. Unless you were there you have no idea the wreckage people were causing and the beatings they were handing out like candy. When I took my kids in 2010 I was pleasantly surprised it wasn't gang infested like it was in 1993. We had a nice time, our family enjoyed our trip. I went again with a private event, we had an even better experience. Went again a few years later and had a blast again minus the fact my sons seatbelt came loose and he said he almost fell off so our family who goes to all the theme parks all the time had a complication because now I couldn't get him on any rides. Finally got him back on them last year. We went yesterday 05 November 2016 for the Life Teen as a family and it was nerve wracking and annoying. We made it on 6 rides. We were there from 10:30-9 but the park closed at 8 and we were in an event from 5:30-9. Our first ride Full Throttle we were in line by 10:40. The ride broke twice while we waited and hour. 4 different maintenance guys had to come to figure out the sensor that was having issues. Finally got on the ride, it was a nice ride. After that we had lunch. Fed a family of 5 for $75. RIDICULOUS. Goliath broke while in line, watching the cars of people stuck going up. Went on twisted colossus and that was fun, went on the pirate ship (for my boy who's still nervous), flash and Wonder Woman. Went to NINJA to try to get one more ride in before event started, so excited there was barely any line. Got in line and it moved quick and then all of a sudden it stops moving when we are inside just about to where it lines up and the lines don't hardly move. Finally get to a line and realize I have to be in the front two rows or We'll never got on. There are six of us so now I am forced to send the two groups of kids before me so a two of my kids don't have to go alone. Aged 13, 12, 11, 10. I didn't want any of them stuck and not have someone. The workers were letting the fast pass people on over and over and over again. People were getting upset and that could cause a situation that I'm not sure Magic Mountain has the ability to handle. I heard over and over again while in lines that rides were constantly breaking all over the park and they would pay the extra money to go to Disney where the rides were better maintained and I agree. I LOVE going to Disney and California adventure because the rides are well maintained, clean, and you won't go to the bathroom at the entrance and find blood and poo on toilet seats and back of toilet, cracked floor tile with standing water in it by the door to the stall, and a ride from 1988 that had the beginnings of metal corrosion all over. This is the same reason I rarely go to Knott's Berry Farm. It's a shame that both of these theme parks have been left to turn into crap just waiting to kill someone. Maintain your parks better, charge less for food and allow food to be brought in so those of us that like to buy season passes and merchandise can afford it. I only fed my kids once yesterday because it is way way too expensive. There is a reason Disney is packed to the point I don't like going unless it's raining and people aren't there anymore. It's getting too crowded, however I can bring in a cooler of food, I know the bathrooms are spotless, and I trust the rides are maintained properly. As someone who works in Aviation Maintenance I know accidents happen, however if you put the $ in and properly maintain your park and attractions, you could charge more $ and people like me with teens would be there more often. I live an hour and a half away from Magic Mountain, I live 2 hours from Disney and Knott's. I'd much rather be able to go to Magic Mountain at least once a month, however tempted as I was to upgrade our passes we paid $50 each for yesterday to season passes I didn't and the reasons are all here. Your rides aren't maintained, your food costs are outrageous, you put $ into metal detectors instead of your bathrooms. Promote an environment where families are safe, teenagers won't be shot and killed, and you won't need those metal detectors.",Cruiser678549
30,Not my favourite park.,"When I first arrived at the park it seemed to lack the fun atmosphere I thought it would have. I don't think I saw one staff member smile once. The service wasn't good at all and the staff are very unfriendly. The food was also very over priced and wasn't even nice. The rollercoasters were also a bit to extreme for me, I almost felt hurt and in pain after each ride. I wouldn't be returning here again.",Catherineeee
50,Best theme park for thrill seekers,"I always wanted to go there to get the maximum roller coast experience and I got it. It was really crowded,. Unfortunately I couldn't afford flash pass so I bought tickets online in advance and went to the park as soon as they opened. I'm so glad that I read other reviews so I know the right thing to do. As soon as I got in to park I bought the refillable souvenir bottle. Then I rang to X2 which meant to be the most Castries ride in the park and ride that got the longest queue. Luckily I only had to to wait about half an hour. It was really good ride but for my experience I reckon Tatsu was better than X2.Flash pass would be be recommended but if you I can't afford I reckon to be at the park early as you can. I was at the park for about 7 hours and I could only ride 9 coasters. staff were not very organized at all. I saw many rides left with plenty of empty seats. park was fairly clean. Food was fairly expensive too but what can you expect from a theme park anyway. I never had to wait for long line for the toilet or for food.Overall park was amazing for thrill seekers and I would never recommend for small kids. I will definitely come back to this park.",hansala
30,Roller coasters park!,"I hate queuing so I paid $$$ for fast passes.... and if you don't mind paying a crazy amount on fast pass I say go for it. It is the value of a plane ticket abroad but yolo and all that jazz. The roller coasters are scary and worth the screams. But as a family theme park I prefer Universal Studios. Six flags have lines for everything, rides, toilets, food places, I even had to wait in line to get a fast pass (ironic much)... not enough staff for the $$$ they make. This is a roller coasters park. The food stands that are dotted throughout the park have a limited choice. But the main food places are fine. The toilets are gross and not clean. Enjoy!",Travel667261
50,This is the place for roller coaster fans,"This is my favourite theme park. So many fantastic rides. Love what they have done to Collossus, which is now twisted Collossus. I think this is now my favourite wooden roller coaster with Apocalypse close behind. I would have to say that I think the Flash Pass is a bit of a rip off. It doesn't include X2 unless you pay further, and you can't just go to the ride unless the electronice device they give you indicates you can. If not you have to book that ride. Anyway, Magic Mountain is still very good.",Jeff J

20,Halloween at the Mtn.,"We decided to go for the season pass special for the rest of 2016 and all of 2017 plus parking and access to all gold membership to all parks six flags. Now don't get me wrong but we thought we had things covered and would just need extra $$$ for food and some souvenirs but with the season pass it does not include any real discounts off the flash pass which is almost a necessity for when the park is full like the Saturday of Halloween and everyone was buying. The lines were horrendous long for almost any coasters and there seemed to be a genuine slow down by ride attendants and hardly no one was really motivated to keep lines smooth and moving for those who didn't shell out for flash passes. Another knock would be the basic flash pass that was a reservation like fast pass at Disneyland was not free and started around $50 per person. They also have other choices which are more expensive and if you are a family could set you back major $$$$. Of course if you shelled out $499 for a season flash pass per person x 4=$2000 more bucks for me and now you are covered for the whole year but consider I don't live in CA and will be driving to use my passes I cannot justify the added cost. They also have other add-ones that you can add food and shopping to tie up all loose money you might have left but I would prefer complete pkgs instead of buying add-one to everything. Now if this the park for you for all of 2017 then that's your ticket, but I prefer some different choices and need some money left for other options. I was wholly disappointed about my visit on 10/29/2016 and hope that this will not be the norm of poor services for all next year. Plus they could spend some of that windfall on maintenance in the future and everyone would win!",Kerry L

50,FUN FUN FUN...and did I say FUN!,"I took my niece and son to the park and we went on every ride including the Devil Dive and Sling shot. My son is 20 and nice is 18, it truly is a park where young adult can have fun and be thrilled!",Kimberly T
50,"Loved it, loved it, loved it","My 2 teenage sons and I had a blast at Six Flags. The rides were fantastic. We were at the park for 12 hours and only just managed to go on every ride and that was with a platinum flash pass. Yes the pass is pricey but as we travelled from Australia and may never be able to make it back it was money worth spent. I found the staff competent and nice. I loved that they didn't kick us out of the park for fright night like Disney and Universal do unless you spend more money on additional special event tickets. We bought 1 drink refill and refilled it with water all day and shared not just for the cost but for the convenience of not having to hold a bottle each all day. The creatures running around at night scaring us were hilarious, I spent more time laughing than screaming and the bands were terrific. On our trip we visited Disney, California Adventure Park, Knotsberry and Universal, this was the best park by far. A great day out for thrill seekers.",Trek593783
50,Brilliant theme park!,"This was my second visit and it was such a good day. Plenty of roller coasters to chose from that our all so different. We got the platinum fast pass which is well worth it on a busy day, bit expensive and you had to pay extra for certain rides when you have already paid for general admission. Would definitely recommend.",Gemma B
10,Staff/cast not great. Dirty park. Rides shut down!,"Let me clarify before I get into my real review. The rides are great. I've grown up going and love the newer rides. But six flags needs to invest in maintaining their old ones. And more trash pick up. TRASH EVERYWHERE.My big comment is about waiting in line for a ride that shuts down right before you get on it. We waited 1.5 hours for Riddler, and it had a problem right before we were supposed to board. They suggested we wait for the ride to resume, so we waited another 30 minutes before they called it an ""extended"" delay. I asked one of the staff if they have any compensation for us, because it's frustrating to literally waste your time in a line for a ride that you're not going to ride. We paid $89 to get into the park and every minute counts to go on rides and enjoy the park. The staff were NOT apologetic and said that maybe I could get a fast pass from the ride operator. But the ride operator was busy trying to fix the ride, so that was no hope. I tried to flag him and he made eye contact with me but didn't acknowledge me.Hey Magic mountain, here's a tip: CARE ABOUT YOUR VISITORS AND TRAIN YOUR STAFF ON CUSTOMER SERVICE! If our time is wasted due to your old rides, COMPENSATE US! We pay a lot of money to get in!Also fast passes are waaaaay too expensive. Come on. Disneyland gives them out for free. Be like Disneyland. After paying $89 for the general ticket I had to watch fast pass people cut in front of me? NOT COOL.Lines for bathrooms and food are ridiculous. I don't know exactly how this problem can be solved, but even just to refill our soda would take half an hour. That isn't fun for us, nor anyone else. And everyone is upset about the food prices. I mean, I know food is more expensive in theme parks, but $10 for a slice of pizza, ridiculous! Six flags, you're EXPLOITING your visitors! STOP IT!",Melissa D
30,Small Kids Area,"Never go on a holiday weekend.Kids area is small, old and doesn't have many things to do. With that being said, my kids (under 7) enjoy the area. Just wish the park would have all rides going all the time and shows more frequently.We have season passes and go regularly. They rarely have all the rides open. The staff is unenthusiastic about working there.The lines for the food are long.But for the price of the season pass, it's not a bad buy. It's close drive (an hour) and the kids are always exhausted afterwards. They haven't gotten bored of it so that's good news!",Cynthia A
50,Very affordable,This location gives you a couple options for affordability. 1. Bring a soda but get 1 free promotions all the time. 2. They allow you to pay a little bit more for a season pass and take pic and slap on the card. It's a beautiful theme park. Ride Superman and Goliath they are my favorites.Plenty of hotels and motels to choose from as well.5 stars,Peter M
30,"Great roller coasters, everything else needs some work.","This was our second visit on our 2016 annual passes, first was back at New Year's for the holiday event. This time it was the Halloween fright fest. Friday wasn't very crowded so the rides were manageable in terms of wait times. However Saturday was very crowded, so much so that we left early and went back to the hotel pool. Some of the rides were over 2 hours waiting time, and even with a gold flash pass we were having over an hour wait for rides. The rides in most cases are worth the wait, but it's the rest of the park where they really need some attention. The bathrooms and food facilities are very tired, they could use some updated paint and maintenance. The sinks were clogged, the wood rotten, and the floors were cracked or worn. The food facilities all had incredibly long lines, even for drink refills. Food was lukewarm in most cases. They need some dedicated drink refill stations where it's only drinks no food. Just about everyone had the refillable bottles, so putting one staff member there to monitor would be more efficient than making people wait 30 min for a drink refill when it's 90 degrees. We recently lived in Germany for 3 years and went to Europa Park multiple times over those years. The difference in quality of the two parks is quite apparent. EP is an experience worth paying a premium for, MM is more of a discount park that's more about volume than quality.",kf93
20,Poor,"Visited today with 5 friends from the UK. We were on a 3 day Go LA pass so had to go to the Will Call booth to pick up our tickets. This took 20 minutes as opposed to going to the ticket booth at the entrance which we could have just walked straight to. After going on a few rides (Goliath and Twisted Collosus and the dodgems were not working) we decided to break for lunch at a BBQ place called AJ's I think. The queue was not that big but it was organised that bad it was 25 mins before we got served. Next up we went to River Rapids ride. The sign on the entrance said 15 mins wait which ended up being 50 which had it said that we wouldn't have bothered. We decided to try Goliath again and found it working this time. After walking down the line and passing the ""30 minutes waiting"" sign we estimated it would be about 15 minutes until we got on the ride based on where the sign was. This turned out to be 40 minutes much to the annoyance of the 3 people waiting for us. After this we decided to leave. I can appreciate it may be busy but this was Friday 21st Oct and we were at the front gate at 10am so not like we left things late and it was busy with scare fest. I think the park should post waiting times on electronic boards similar to those at Universal Studios so guests get a true representation of wait times and can base their choices on these. Overall a disappointing day.",Simon B
40,Could do better,"Absolutely spoilt for choice for rollercoasters, almost all of which were fantastic. However, even with a platinum flash pass we couldn't manage the full park selection of rides.Pros:Excellent rides, best I've been onShort distances between ridesEasy to plan with the flash passCons:Queues absolutely excessiveOperations were inefficientIt's practically impossible to get a refill drink without queuing for at least 20 minutesIt took 25 mins to get the first drink which had already been pre purchasedWe had to queue for at least 30 mins for a flash pass which we were forced to purchase due to the queue timesThe park does look a bit tiredTip: if you plan to get a flash pass, buy online beforehand as the queue for pre-purchased passes was emptyThere is absolutely no way you could even get around half of this park if you didn't buy a pass and the park really needs to sort this out as it really is unfair on people that can't afford them. Also, you should allow customers to bring in a drink and maybe a small snack like Universal",teetkac
40,Fright Fest!!,"We had the enjoyment of bringing our sons to fright fest and our youngest was FINALLY tall enough to enjoy the ""big boy"" rides and no more splitting ride times! I was an amazing time and fright fest was a blast! At the end of the night the boys got to do the Thriller dance!! Great night creating and spending time with family!!",Davidg8834
10,Dirty,"Dirty park. You can tell the rides are not cleaned often. Someone vomited on a ride and the staff had no access to water...they ran and returned with 2 cups to swab the ride. These are bodily fluids, people. Will never return here.",Joann S
30,Still fun but definitely needs to be updated!,"The good thins is that the thrill of a rollercoaster ride will never get old. A visit to Six Flags will still get your blood running and make you feel alive. However, it is also important to point out that a number of improvements are evidently needed. In my opinion, these are the ones to work on:- Improve the mobile app: Although a mobile app is available, it doesn't update wait times for the rides often or fast enough. This is 2016 people. We should be able to see updates at least every 5 minutes.- The food: Really?! Does it make sense to wait 30 plus minutes for an overpriced and mediocre hamburger? Nope, that is not good enough. So, Magic Mountain, please invest some time and effort on food quality and the service experience. There are no excuses, The park is not located in a remote area that makes it difficultto get to or to transport supplies. If you want us to go more often or spend more time at the park, give us better options and better service.- Bathrooms: Come on! Fix them, clean them up more often. It's a basic necessity.I look forward to going back to this park in the future. However, as I paying customer, I refuse to accept that this is the best Magic Mountain can do. Thus, please accept my comments as constructive feedback.",Dr. JP

20,"Awesome rides, awful queues","Was there for 6 hours. Had 3 rides, which were excellent, particularly X2. But the cost of admission is a complete waste of money unless you get a ""flashpass"" by which the richer patrons get to jump the queues. Therefore, don't go unless you either want to spend the extra or love queuing for 2 hours to go on a ride. Also $4.50 for a 20oz bottle of water gives an idea of the pricing structure for refreshments.",Harrybelly1010

40,Magic day,My wife's first time and my last time over a decade ago. The park has changed and the rides keep improving. Get to New Revolution early and worth it! We did Gold Flash pass and made the day as no or short wait. If you don't go often I think worth the $75 per person. They even serve beer at a few locations so can relax between rides or at the end of the day.,DonKKer

40,Overall good,"Overall a good day out with excellent rides and fun for all the family. Would recommend the Superman and Tatsu rides as the best in the park. Only thing to complain about is some toilets were very dirty, but some were clean. Also needed more lockers in more areas.",Jmemul
40,Loooooooots of waiting,"Our group went for one day in september which has limited opening hours (only weekends) lines were 1-2+hours/ride so in one day you really need to think which rides you really want to go. Unless you buy flashpass which has 3 levels (also 3 different prices) and you can reduce the waiting time to rides. we didnt buy that and end up going only 4 rides in that day. Also the lines for food were pretty much the same, 2 hours for a burger meal... but if you are looking for thrill, go here but buy that flashpass! And go as early as you can because place gets crowded pretty early. And buy tickets online in advance if possible to save money rather than buying them from the park with full price.",Stiimi

30,Below expectations.,"Maybe I was expecting more, being that this is one of the most talked about Six Flags park, however, I found it to be very dirty. I didn't see a single person walking around sweeping or cleaning the entire day. New rides are even dirty!Lines to get drinks when you purchase the free refills are longer than some of the wait times for the rides.Speaking of the rides, most of them are headbangers with the overhead restraints slamming your ears. There were only a few rides that I actually enjoyed, and I am a rollercoaster fanatic. Twisted Colussus, Superman, Full Throttle and the New Revolution were the standouts in the park. The rest of the rides were either rough or in desperate need of updating.I bought the Flash Pass and if you can afford it, it's definitely worth purchasing, as you won't get to ride much otherwise. I enjoyed the Six Flags in NJ way more.",Tim S
30,Park needs updating and rides were ok...,"We visited this six flags a few days ago with my in-laws. There were 8 of us. Four adults and four kids. We've never been before so we weren't sure what to expect. We got to the entrance and there were metal detectors and workers checking people's bags. We waiting outside of the metal detector because there were people just finishing up getting their bags checked and we figured the workers would let us know when it was our turn. The worker looks at us and says, ""are you just going to stand there or are you going to come in?!""...my sister-in-law and I were kind of shocked at her attitude for no reason so we didn't say anything for a second and then my sister-in-law responded with something along the lines of how we didn't want to hang out up front all day and the worker replies, ""well, it looks like your just going to stand there all day since your not coming in...."" I got her name because I was going to talk to a Manger but I never ended up finding one. Her name was Stephanie. Pleasant, friendly young lady...NOT!!! It wasn't until we had already got our tickets and entered the park that we found out the kid rides all close at 7pm and the entire park is haunted starting at 7. We had planned on staying til 9 or so, which wasn't going to happen after finding that out. The rides were ok. Nothing amazing. The superman ride was about 12 seconds long and I'm not exaggerating. Silverwood in Idaho has a ride similar to it but it last a lot longer and is much more fun. I will say there weren't any lines though which was nice. There aren't many rides for 3-4 year olds though. All of our other kids who range from 5 to 10 could ride all the kids rides but there were kids rides that my almost 4 year old couldn't ride. Overall we had a fun time but the park and rides weren't anything amazing. Neither was the customer service!!!",Heather W
30,if you like roller coasters this is the place for you,"Took my family there for part of our vacation for my daughter and granddaughter love roller coasters. It was a fun day for all. They had their version of the Halloween Nights start at 7Pm. That was not so good with an 8 year old around. The people dressed in makeup and paid to haunt you do not take NO or STOP for an answer. They scared the living daylights out of my granddaughter 2 different times by 2 different people even though my daughter and I asked several times not to. The food was not to bad. There are some steep hills to walk, so if you are not in good condition beware and rest up. There is a kiddie ride area, but my granddaughter found it boring. There are characters that you can take pictures with around the park. They have a deal where you buy their drinking cup for $14.99 and you get free refills all day the day you are there( they lost their money on that one for my husband filled it up at least 8 times).",catsmarty
40,went for a travel,it was nice as expectedthe place was a bit crowded but still I could enjoy about 5 rides!Well I don't think I'm going to visit here again but anyway is worth it to visit here once in a lifetime,Suyeon K
40,Awesome for roller coaster fans but the pricing is ridiculous,"I'm a big roller coaster fan. Being in the greater Los Angeles area of course let me no choice but to visit this theme park.Some quick notes:===============Ticket + Fright Fest Maze pass: $75Flash Pass Platinum: $130Parking ticket: $20Sports bottle w/ free refills: $16Meal warrant for 4 chicken strips w/ fries and drink: $15Total: $256 (approx.)I was there for the roller coasters only and maybe some of the water rides. The coasters are awesome, hands down. They have 16 in total and many of them are thrilling. I love them and with the Flash Pass I was able to do some of the rides twice or even three times.Here is my review:1.) X2 - 10/10 (Crazy! You gonna love it!)2.) Twisted Colossus - 10/10 (Deep drop, fast, curvy and long ride!)3.) Tatsu - 9/104.) Full Throttle - 8/10 (Rocket start but short duration)5.) Scream - 8/106.) Goliath - 8/107.) Superman, Escape from Krypton - 8/10 (Rocket start which is awesome but too short)8.) Riddler's Revenge - 8/109.) Batman The Ride - 8/1010.) Apocalypse - 7/10 (Quite fast wooden coaster)11.) Drop of Doom - 7/10 (Going up really high, great view of the park from above!)12.) Green Lantern - 7/1013.) The New Revolution - 7/10 (Disappointed about this one. You wear VR goggles during the ride but the resolution is like 640x480. They use a Samsung S7 as display device, by the way!)14.) Ninja - 6/1015.) Roaring Rapids - 6/10 (Water ride, you will get wet or even drenched! Be prepared.)16.) Jet Stream - 4/10 (Water ride, almost no thrill)The rest of the rides I did not do.I took most of the rides at least two times. When I got into the park which was right at the opening I hasted to X2 - for which I had no Flash Pass. (It's not included in the platinum pass which would cost another $15 for 1x ride which is nuts!!) I just had to wait 10 min in the line which was awesome. I tried to get a second ride but the line already got so long I went back to the entrance to pick up my flash pass. Then I went to the other rides.Here's a few tips for newbies:1.) Buy tickets and parking valet online (cheaper if 7 days ahead)2.) Buy a Flash Pass (yes, it's expensive but skipping lines is so awesome and safes a lot of time! More time, more fun!)3.) Wear pants with deep pockets or pockets with zippers4.) Arrive at the park before 8:30 a.m. if you go there by car5.) Be prepared to be searched and go through a metal detector (no knifes, guns, sharp sticks etc.)6.) When the gates open at 10:30 a.m. rush straight ahead to the locker area and buy a day pass for a small locker which costs $12. Store your stuff and just take a7.) Get yourself to X2 (it won't be included in the Flash Pass unless you pay an additional $15 for one single ride!)8.) Try to get another ride with X29.) Head back to the entrance to grab your Flash Pass (right next to the locker area)10.) Take all the other rides and have funIt is obvious that the park is totally overpriced. I won't go there again because of this. Pity. Love the roller coasters, though. X2 is really awesome.The limitation on the Platinum Flash Pass which costs $130 is a rip off to me. You can use it on all rides except for the mentioned which work only one single time:- Superman- The New Revolution- Full Throttle- Twisted ColossusBe also aware that they do not allow fanny packs on the rides and you are not allowed to bring foods and drinks into the park.",GermanGymrat
40,"Fun roller coasters, Get fast pass if you can afford, expensive place","Was in LA on a ftehr son long weekend adn this was our first stop. Last year we went to cedar park in Ohio (awesome for you coaster fans).I read this six flags had great coasters so here we went.I arranged way in advance since I was coming in from the east coast. I bought Platinum pass (4115 each) and maze pass (maybe another $30-$40 each), plus the $70+ each ticket price, so not cheap but was not going to risk lines as we had 1 day to hit the whole park, which we were able to do.As others have commented, restrooms need more attention and food is super high priced and not real good. The quality is something corporate could easily fix and probably boost revenue (certainly satisfaction for sure)Bottom line, they have some great coasters and we had a great time.",kenuga
40,Great if you like coasters,"My 11 year old son and I attended. We paid for the Platinum fast pass because I do not go if you have to spend a third of your day in lines. On summer days I would not attend, too many people too long of lines. We went on October 10th and it was not crowded at all the fast past only saved us time on about three rides . the rest we really didn't even need the fast pass because we walked right up to every ride. But you never know what lines are going to be like until you're there so it's hard to decide whether you want to spend the extra money on the fast pass or not. If you're concerned about money this may not be the place obviously typical amusement park fees apply for everything. I would not take younger children here. If you're older and not in good health I would also stay away the rides are aggressive and can easily hurt an older more fragile person. My son and I are healthy and we rode the Green Lantern and thought it was one of the worst rides ever because of the really tight turns that snap you. But the rest of the rides especially Full Throttle and Batman were worth the price we enjoyed those very much. If you're going with a mixed group where some like Fast aggressive thrill rides and some don't it's going to be tough because you're going to break up from your group someone ride someone and some will be left feeling out if you have a mixed group of people it may be better to go to Universal Studios or something like that where you all can enjoy the time.",jmac33
50,JUST THE TWO OF US FOR OUR 13TH ANNIVERSARY,"We had a great time! Twisted Colassas was definitely our favorite along with Full Throttle and X2. Even though it was Friday, the lines moved quickly and we were able to ride several of them more than once. It seems to me that they've increased the staff and upped the training because the lines are smoother and the cars run full.",Kam H
40,Fun day out!,"Been here twice now (once in the summer and most recently at Easter time) and I've always had a great day out!Rollercoasters are unreal - it deffo knocks out Disney or Universal out of the park in terms of thrill rides but the park deffo needs a fresher look. The majority of it looks old and run down and stuck in the 90s but the quality and safety of the rides is amazing.If you visit in the summer or at the weekend or a public holiday I would recommend getting the flash passes as it means you're not waiting as long. The second time we visited was during the weekday and there was no holidays (was Easter time in the UK) and the park was significantly quieter so we actually got on everything (even if it had broken down and was doing some checks) very quick and several times.Food is the same as any theme park, fast food and expensive. Keep an empty water bottle and fill it up at the water hoses as it will save you a lot of money.Entrance fee was around $75 - a lot less expensive than the likes of Disney and Universal (the thrill rides make it worth while as you would not get that there!!) however I am unsure if it is any cheaper online. We hired a car the first time we went and had to pay parking which was fairly cheap and the second time we took an Uber from Downtown LA and was only $50 to get there and back (between 3 people).Been wanting to visit a Six Flags theme for ages now (I sadly have on my bucket list to visit the massive theme parks of the US) and very glad I went - it did not disappoint!",Teri-Louise Martin
40,Buy the flash pass the lines are outrageous,"We decided to splash out on purchasing the platinum flash passes, which was certainly a hefty cost! But it meant no lines whatsoever and absolutely smashed out a huge number of coasters compared to someone without it. Wicked day out!",jaydent1402
50,Best rollercoaster experience ever!,"This place is a must!!! I spent 10 hours there and hardly managed to try all the rollercoasters. Each of them is a little different and has some special feature that will surely shake you:) absolutely the best time. Try the Green Lantern, X2 and Superman - these are the best rides, you will love them, I get scared even thinking about them",Jacques-Chuck
30,"If you came from far, buy the pass.","I would never return to Six Flags Magic Mountain if they didn't have the best rides in the world. Seriously. X-2, Sheikra, Goliath, Superman, Drop of Doom, Full Throttle and Twisted Colossus are beyond great and are mandatory on the book of every adrenaline junkie - such as myself.The park, however, is messy, poorly cleaned and intentionally crowded - almost designed to waste your time. It only almost exclusively on weekends (aparently this is recent) and, therefore, its lines are as long as a summer day (the park itself, however, closes at only 8pm Sat and 6pm Sun).Therefore my advice - if, like me, you are travelling from far just to ride the coasters - is: buy the Flash Pass. It's expensive? Yes. But without it, your entrance and day are wasted. It is nearly impossible to go on a third of the rides without it.I came with my family (aunt, uncle and a teenage cousin) and we bought a season pass to go two days - because we know one wouldn't be enough. We managed to ride FIVE coasters on day 1. On day 2 we bought the expensive Flash Passes and were able to ride 15 - with two hours less.People who live in the region can buy an annual pass and go on 3-4 rides per saturday. But if you want to hit them all, the $70 of the Flash Pass are mandatory. Do include that on your planning.",vimatasi
40,Extreme Fun,"We went for the first day of the Halloween celebrations so it was kind of crowded but it was well worth it. The wait times are horrible without fast passes so if you get a chance buy one, but if you don't, pick out the rides carefully and you will have a lot of fun. The mazes for halloween are awesome and pretty well set up, the rides well worth the wait. Only reason i don't give it a 5 star is because the food service is bad at best and fast passes are sold out very fast.",Omar N
50,Bday vacation,"The park is decorated great for freight fest, during the day it is child friendly but after 7 pm certain areas do not allow children under 13 years. If you are a roller coaster lover this is definitely a park for you to visit. I have a member pass which is worth the price but daily prices are close to a season pass price so great deal which includes parking. The lines flowed at a good pace with plenty of shaded areas.",Erlinda M
20,Dont bother with children,"Firstly, they charge $20 to park miles away. The shuttle buses are slow. Then they dont allow water to be brought into the park, so you are forced to buy their $4.50 water inside. Secondly the lines are huge, dont bother if you dont buy a fastpass which will cost even more money.Half way through the day my expensive fastpass stopped working which caused us to lose our spot on a ride. By the time i made my way back to the fastpass counter from the other side of the park, I'd lost 40 minutes. The place is a rip. I would never go back",Trently77
50,Heaven for all roller coaster fans,"If you are a roller coaster fan like me, this is the perfect place for you. I was there a week before labourday weekend, it was a quiet day. I firstly headed to revolution, no waiting line, and then to X2 where I waited 30min. X2 was in my opinion an awesome coaster of its kind, a must if you are there. After that I continued on all the other coaster, which had all surprisingly 0-5min waiting time, except for the new and spectacular ones like Tatsu and Full Throttle. Even on renewed colossus it went quite fast.In spite of the coasters, the park is in my opinion not the cleanest. (dirt on the floor, some toilets looked awfull, bumpy walkways). Not comparable to sea world. The food is ok, not the best but ok. Don't expect too much. But I liked that idea of the drinking cup you could buy which you can refill on almost any store in the park for free.So to conclude I closely advise to visit the park on weekdays or off season, avoid labourday. And watch out for the weather, if you are there on a busy way its not enjoyable to stand in line at 36°C.",Simon J.
50,I went by myself....,"I went solo to Six Flags Magic Mountain, which actually turned out to be a lot of fun. I went early on a Saturday morning and was able to get to the front of the line at the gate before they actually opened. The ticket office is not the same as the gate to get into the park, so get your ticket early before the ticket line gets long. I rode all the major rides and roller coasters before 2 p.m. which was a lot faster than I was expecting. The lines got longer the later in the day it got, so being early is key if you want to get through all of them.",Chris H

30,Amazing rides but a flash pass is essential!,"We are a young couple from Australia who visited the park on a Sunday (the park is only open on weekends during some parts of the year).We absolutely love big scary rides, and Six Flags Magic Mountain has an endless amount of awesome rollercoasters, but the huge, massive lines for each ride meant that during our 9+ hours at the park, we only got on 5 rides.It was extremely hot when we visited and the park is very hilly and you will do a lot of walking.The lines for everything were all so long and very little shade or cooling is provided. Water is extremely expensive, not a great mix in a place where people can become easily dehydrated.Lines for food were very long and restrooms were dirty with long queues as well.1 of the 5 rides we went on broke down while we were on it, another ride broke down while we were waiting, adding an extra 30 minutes to the already hour long wait and another ride we were waiting for was also shut down for about 20 minutes, we think due to a passenger being ill.In saying that when we visited they were running their Halloween fright night which was amazing to see.I believe even though they are very expensive, a flash pass would be 110% worth it, so you can actually make the most out of your day and get on every ride. It would also mean not having to stand in line waiting in the heat, getting burnt and dehydrated!! It would definitely be worth the extra money!!!",gtravel25

10,Worst Park Everr for a tourist,"I'm so sad to say that's this is the worst theme park everrrr ! I have been to all theme and water parks in Orlando , Disney land Paris , Universal city Hollywood,... Etc never I have came to such a disappointing frustrating experience. First of all if you choose to do a self parking of ur car be prepared to walk for long distance there are no shuttle trains or anything like that to take you to the park . Thank God we took the valet parking but we had to wait for around 10 min to 15 min on getting our car back to go home , although we were only 4 groups waiting for their cars . I wouldn't ever imagine that it will take us more than 40 min to get into the park gates having our online booked tickets and valet parking !!! Can you imagine over 40 min for security check to enter the park !!!!! Standing in the line under the hot sun me and my kids and my husband for over 40 min !!! Never it took us more than 5 to 10 min in Disney or Universal or the other huge parks ! One personnel on each gate to do the checking for a park which operates only during weekends can u imagine the crowd ?!!! Then the next nightmare going on the famous rides . My kids had to stand for over 60 min for a ride then they were told its under a current delay which occurred around 3 time at least on this specific ride and on other operating famous rides too !! We finally decided to buy my two kids a flash pass with an extra of 54$ each , while the actual tickets cost around 55 $ for an online one week in advance tickets ! This 54$ flash pass doesn't work on all rides and an extra of 12 $ is required for each single ride of the very famous rides with the flash pass of 80$ category not less !!! Can anyone believe this ?!!Now how this fast pass operate ? You get a kind of small device in a key chain that help you to choose ur ride and the nearest available time . Guess what ? the time for each ride that they choose was after 50-60 minutes !!!! And this is using a flash pass !!!' So by the end of this frustrating day my kids were finally able to get on 6 rides al together out of I guess 40 or more !!!!! Using Flash pass !!!!! Me and their dad didn't have the energy or patience to wait in any of the long lines for getting on a ride . We only did a water ride with them when the park was closing .I would never everrrr go or advice people to go there it's a waste of money and time and energy .The reason I gave one star rating is for the kettle corn I enjoyed there actually it came to my luck it was the only food station with no long waiting lines of people when I was at this spot , otherwise prepare for waiting for at least 30 min to get something to eat on this park . I forgot to mention that most of the rides except for a very very few ones don't have a waiting time screen to tell u about the average waiting time before going on the line !!!!!!! The whole thing felt like a tourist trap , Don't Go There !",Noura B
40,Amazing roller coasters,"My husband and I always fit in a theme park on our holidays despite being a bit older. We bought tickets online and also the platinum flash pass which is pricey but totally worth it. We got to the park 1/2 hour before opening which meant we were inside and picked up our passes by about 10:45. We did the once only rides first never waiting more than about 5 mins. As the day progressed the wait time was a little longer but never more than about 15mins. We did all of the thrill seeker rides and our favorite tatsu twice which was the forward facing roller coaster- complete adrenalin rush. The roller coasters are amazing - forwards/ backwards/ spinning. Another advantage of the flash pass is that is tells you when rides are down and when they are working again saving you time walking to something not working. A family of 4 could share a flash pass for 2 people taking it in turns - this is going to make your day much more enjoyable.The park needs double the amount of toilets with waits at every block- tip there are two lots of women's toilets just near the front gate with one male- everyone thinks the second one in the middle is for men- almost no queue every time.The lines for food and drink were ridiculous I felt sorry for people waiting for 2 hours for a ride and then 30 mins for a drink- they need to double the number of food outlets and have something decent if people want to pay for it and you can't bring in your own food. The ""best"" place in the park is the sports bar with 30 min wait for a table even though half of them were empty and 30 min wait for food- it was at least airconditioned You don't go to these places for the food but not having to wait for an hour would make the day more enjoyable.But would I go back- yes the rides are amazing attention needs to be paid to other areas of the park.",TanSea
40,Fun day,"We got to six flags by 9am. When the doors opened at 10:30 we ran to X2. After the ride ended we could see a big line already forming. Next we walked back to get our platinum flash pass... Definitely worth it since most the rides were a 1-2 hour wait and we were able to just walk right in most of them.How I'd rate the rides....X2-10/10 if you want to be scared shitless and feel like you're dying.Viper 6/10- quick, fun, raises the heart rate a bit but could do it again!New revolution- 7/10- the glasses made me feel like I was in a totally different world. Cool experience.Rapids - 5/10- just like the one at Disney. You will get wet if you don't sit in the right spot!Tatsu- 9/10 you face the ground on this ride and again I almost died.Riddler - 6/10 - I can't remember this one too much so I'm only giving 6.Ninja - 4/10- pretty fun but nothing scary or heart raising.Green lantern- 8/10 this ride scared me too.. It was like being on the Disney swinging Ferris wheel times 1000...Batman-6/10- fun.Goliath-7/10 lots of loops but manageable.Full Throttle- 7/10 the start is fun! The loop is scary... It back tracking is unexpected and scary... But the ride is fast... So 7.Scream- 7/10 I was expecting more... But it was still fun!Twisted - 8/10 holy crap... This was an unexpected scream fest... It has its scary I'm gonna die moments but manageableSuperman -7/10... Fast ride... Wish you could go twice..",Dana K
40,Husband's Choice Day,"We had a few day stopover in LA and this was my husband's choice of what to do.We went on a Sunday, and got there at opening. I highly recommend that because the lines just got longer as the day went on.We only waited for like 10 minutes for the Goliath, which was one of the first ones we went to. Twisted Collosus was my husband's favorite because it was long, the drop was unexpected and fast, and the zero G turn was awesome. I liked Scream because there weren't many drops and when you did drop it was in a spin so it didn't make your stomach flip.There are different sections of the park, kind of like Disney, and everything is themed. For instance, Kent Farm Roasted Corn in the DC comics area. The food was insanely expensive - $12 for a piece of pizza.We were disappointed that Apocalypse was closed when we arrived and they couldn't tell us when/if it would be back up again so we wasted time walking back to check and left before it reopened (if it did).",Peglerd
50,Six flags is always awsome!,"Took my girlfriend and her 2 sisters on Sept 18, 2016 and had a blast! Was like 100 degrees but soo worth it! The waits were fairly long like usual but what do u expect from a park of this caliber with such a large fan base? The rides were awesome! We had one associate go out of his way to help our situation with the souvenir cups. Awesome job! AMD the rest is the usual, keep in mind freight fest started already so once it got dark u see creepy crawlers walking around, so much fun!",katkiller13
30,Fun.,"We went The weekend after school holidays - it was still relatively crowded.Autumn and it was 38 deg c! Dry heat but omg it was hot.Getting drinks was a nightmare. Why they don't have stalls selling water set up everywhere is beyond me. 2 bottles for $6. Can't take in own water or food.Food is terrible and sloooooooow.We bought a flash pass. The best money we spent. It cost nearly twice the entry fee $100 US$ per person plus $60 for entry, but it was so worthwhile. Got to the front of EVERY queue. In 6 hours after getting through the gate we knocked over all 12 roller coaster rides or 30 minutes per ride. (14000 steps) btw.Some queues were 45 minutes long so without the flash pass meant we would have managed 5 rides or less. Some rides only last 30secs so that would $&$).Great roller coasters. We also paid extra for slingshot ride. Was good but did resent having to pay again. Saw no one else do the ride.",CKE80Y
20,We picked a very bad day to visit.,"We chose a bad day to visit six flags. I went off of a website that said this would be a low crowd day (Sept 10th), and believe me it was wrong. We got there before the park opened thinking to be in line, but the mass of people didn't resemble anything close to order, so there was no line, just a huge group of bodies squished together. Once you get through the metal detector there's another line to get in. It took almost an hour after that to get in. Lines for most coasters were an hour and a half to three hours, lines for filthy bathrooms were 30+ minutes, even the lines to get food/water were 40+ minutes. This made it impossible to stay hydrated, but saved us a lot of money on overpriced drinks. People cutting in line and holding spots for other groups added extra time. We only managed to ride 4 ride the entire day, and we were so dehydrated by the time we left that we got sick. They do sell the flash pass, but the cost to benefit ratio was crazy off. The thing costs more than the tickets to get in and my hotel combined. The employees obviously hate their jobs, they look so miserable. The coasters that we did get to ride were pretty awesome though. (If you ever got to ride one.) X2 was worth the wait, and Goliath was awesome. If you go take note of all the weird places people have stuck gum. It's pretty entertaining.",selinam468
50,Surely the biggest and best rollercoasters on Earth???,"Wow! I mean WOW!!! I hate heights but conquered a few fears here.Best for me were Goliath, Superman and Full Throttle. Oh my word.However, queues were 2 hours per ride. We had express passes which I would highly recommend. You literally get to do EVERYTHING. Expensive way of doing it but trust me, it's worth it!",ChrisGower1975
50,Attractions for kids and the parents,"We just got the annual season pass for Really cheap a good deal and gift for my 9 years old son !Es de los mejores parques de atraccion en Los Angeles California, a un lado esta hurricane harbor y tienen de todo tipo de comida y tiendas!New rides y roller coster the best in town!",Hector M
20,Expected more,"The park is located outside of LA and is not accesible by public transportation (unless you want to spend at least 2 hours on the road).The park is open only on saturday and sunday (so it's crowded), opens in 10:30.Most of your stay in the park will be standing in line - for the best rollercoasters you need to wait at least 2 hours. They don't make it easier for you - most of the lines are not in the shade.If you are willing to spend the money for the ""flash pass"" that cuts the lines for you, you will enjoy it a lot more. You probably won't be able to get on all the extreme rides in one day without it.The day's highlight for me was to get on the X2 coaster, it was awesome.They have great rollercoasters, but I don't think it is worth the hassle.",Or S
50,Big Park with plenty of Big Coasters,"We've been to many many Parks and this is pretty close to Cedar Point as we've been. They have plenty of parking and a very convenient location to get in and out. We were on the VIP Tour w/ Ms. Caitlin Scott and she was the best! Very professional and attentive. I noticed the flash passes were pretty good that people were using, but the VIP Tours are pretty much no wait time..... Using this method, we were able to actually ride all of the large Roller Coasters that were there, except the older ones (no back and head bumping for us) Smiling... The Water Park is exactly next door to the Amusement Ride Park. Same shared gates and same shard parking lot. Had a lot of fun.",WorldWidePlayer
10,Bad experience,"Im very sorry to say that this was the worst experience ive ever had regarding the the amount of money i spent hereTo be real, it was the worst experience ive ever had since i came to LAI came from Dubai, and my friend from here advised me to go to this parkSo she reserved the ticketsThe tickets for each day should have been limited because there was a huge number of people jammed together and it wasn't possibleFor any of them to make the best of this tripWhen we came, we have been in two linesFirst the inspections line which was very long took us around 30-45 minutesThen we had another line to check the ticketsWe where in the park around 11:45So we decided to start with X2 the sign showed that the line will be taking 95 minutes of our time so we went for itDuring that time, there was a mini shut downBut the employees keep reassuring us, that nothing major was happeningBut they kept delaying it till we had been stuck in there For two hours and the big surprise!!!!The game shut down for real !!!BUT !!! Its may work again! So three of the employees told us batter to wait because most of the games will take between 2-3hrs and mostly will work after 30 minSo we waited! Till one of the employee told us batter to go to the complain office and to get a refund or a ticked for another day because two rides were shut down too superman and rabbitSo we went there waited for another line for two other hours in the relations officeand surprise surprise what a good treatment you have after waiting that longThe only thing they offered us is fast pass for one ride only ( at that time is was 5 pm ) and we have 3 hrs onlyBecause they are hosting a privet event at that nightAnd the employee who we spoke to at the office was not respecting and very demeaningAfter we told him we are very tired and none of us ate and one of has low blood sugar because at every restaurant everything was sold out expect for pork hotdogs and we're ""arab muslims""His treatment has changed and heWas not willing to help us outAnd kept on replaying while laughing to us like hes speaking to idiotsSo i couldnt take it and I left the place with my money wasted completelyWhat happened here was very insanely unrealistic and unreasonable",Bashayer A
50,The Park,"This is the park to go and visit. The amount of thrill seeking rides is phenomenal. X2 is definitely the best ride followed by either Goliath, Superman or Batman. Food is stupidly expensive and not great. But the rides and staff were awesome. It must be a monotonous job but they were trying to keep people pumped for the ride and still checking the safety procedures. Absolutely brilliant day. Only annoyed I can't go again on my trip as only open on weekends now.",jakhello147
40,More than a Day!,"Six Flags Magic Mountain is a huge amusement park for all ages. Looney toons area has lots of things for the little kids. Teens and adults have a wide variety of roller coasters to choose from although this past Saturday we found out after was a bring a friend for half price day so we got the flash pass which is an additional cost and is a bit pricy to jump ahead in line but it was a waste! Adults and teen only got 1 ride. We fortunately get a hotel and stay the night so we can go back the next day. Sunday was much better. Just too crowded to get your money's worth in one day. 4 young kids, a teen, and 3 adults we each averaged about 5 rides max. Young kids a few more. With as many small children with us it takes more time to trade off taking small kids in rides while adults run to adult rides. Wear comfortable shoes and be prepared to do a lot of waiting in line for rides of course but food, drinks, and restrooms as well. Some ride lines can be 1 to even 2 hours waits. They have an app that will tell you how long a wait the rides are which is very helpful. Love the Twisted Colossus is one of teenage grandson's and my favs.",sharoncatania2015
10,"Unless you are skinny, DONT BOTHER!","Horrible day at 6 flags, paid for fast pass and ticket spending over $220 Australian. Staff are friendly but unless you are average size the theme park is not for you. There were a lot of people there and a lot not going on rides because of this problem. So if you are bigger than normal the only line you will be lining up for is for the bathroom or burger joint. Waste of money!",Jarryd C
10,Shut water rides / awful customer service,"I booked the night before and it appeared online that all water rides were open. On arrival at 1045am I was told by a lifeguard most (5 major flume / water rides) were shut due to no staff. What rides were open were great though! Around midday I spoke to another member of staff who made up some rubbish about maintenance problems which when challenged just grinned and sent me to customer complaints. I was then greeted by a prickly female who claimed only two were shut, that some more might be open later and never even apologised. I thought this was shocking and clearly they were never going to offer any recompense. Really poor show and wouldn't recommend to anyone",Anthony D
50,Six Flags Magic Mountain For Everyone,"We visited on a Saturday (peak day). You should arrive early. It takes a while to get in the park, but shuttles are provided to the front. We payed for valet, but I didn't see a benefit. If you can, do not take a purse or backpack; your wait will be shorter. There are rides for all levels: novice to thrill; very young to young adult. Lots of games. Lots of food choices. Wear comfortable shoes as a lot of walking is required. The Flash Pass is an extra expense but worth it. Allows you to get on more rides because of shorter wait.",guzellc
40,"Rides are top drawer, queues for food are not","Disney or Universal isn't your thing this is the place to be, some of the rides are incredible my advice is if your only visiting on the rare occasion you must get flash pass! gold would be enough without this on a busy day there is no chance you would get on all the rides. The reason I couldn't give 4 is the wait time for drinks, ridiculous 45 min wait to fill your bottle at one. When the park opens you still have to show your ticket so you miss out time doing that in saying this the rides are outstanding top 5 not to miss 1)x2 2)superman 3)Goliath 4)tatsu 5)riddlers revenge",Stevorfc
20,Understaffed and over priced!,"We only had one day at the park and were very disappointed! Horribly understaffed, ride lines over an hour long and no one is making sure empty seats are filled before the ride takes off; nor are the signs updated saying how long the wait is at certain points in line. Many times we would see 2-4 or more seats empty coming back around time after time, would be very easy to find a party of two who wants to fill those seats! With no one guiding people to fill the individual lines people wait so their group can ride together but would be so simple to fix that! The first 2 of the 3 rides we went on broke down when we were NEXT to get on, causing us to sit there and wait an additional 30 min for repairs after being in line an hour...don't get me wrong, I don't want to ride if dangerous but that again happened twice more that day and seemed to be a common theme. We skipped meals because we didn't want to waste time and barely had time to grab water or a snack and still only managed to make it onto 8 or 9 rides from open to close of the park, 9.5 hours over Labor Day weekend. They really should extend their hours, they would have made much more money off of my family if they had. If you do not buy their version of the fast pass you won't get onto all of the rides, barely even half. If we had known that in advance we would have bought one but halfway through the day when we realized our mistake in not buying it we didn't feel it was worth the money for so little hours at that point! If they would increase their admission even $10 per person they could easily add one more person at each of those popular rides and make things flow better! We had fun and would probably go again at some point but will need to do our homework in advance and figure out a better way to make it to more rides without having to pay an additional $130 pass per person in addition to our $75 admission to do so, even with the $50 extra pass I don't think we'd have gotten too much more done! If you cannot afford the passes look for a day that is not peak times or just skip this park altogether, you will be very disappointed. We utilized the two rides that had single rider lines, they are hard to find but those were our saving grace as we walked up and got right onto those...without that would have been a complete waste of money and a day!",423tammyk
30,Labor Day,"Not our first time to Magic Mountain and due to the availability in hours and our vacation schedule we had to visit on Labor Day. Very long lines for everything, park is rather dirty, we came to ride the new rides especially twisted colossus. First part of the day the twisted colossus was not open, we were disappointed but able to ride rides in the batman area with out long lines. Later the lines were so long that we never got to ride any new rides except twisted colossus and believe me it doesn't disappoint, great ride. Best advice is to go on a weekday, not a holiday or weekend. Souvenir drink cups are a waste of money when it's crowded as it's hard to find anywhere where they don't have a long line to get the free refills. Weather was great in the morning but gets pretty hot in the afternoon.",Debbiea9793
40,Six flags and hurricane harbor.,"I been to both parks, I like to get the season pass, it makes it easier including the free parking otherwise it's not worth it. So my thought on this park it's soooooo crowded the line to enter is insane the lines for food are insane, once in a while I have problems with teenager's cutting in line, but that's not always. My huge only complaint is the line, at the water park and in six flags. I also included the food pass, good deal to get.",Maria C
50,Fast pass your way,A must do while in So Cal. We got the Fast pass and it was well worth the extra money. They give you a pager and tell you what rides you can go on with out wait. or you can set your time and go to the ride with 5 min wait. we got thru the whole park in 6 hours. even got to go on some rides 3 times. so worth the money and saves so much time!,Allen L
40,Fun day even with the long lines!,"We visited Magic Mountain during Labor Day weekend, so the lines were long...1-2 hours wait time per ride. We arrived before the park even opened and the line for the new Revolution ride was already 2 hours when we got inside the park, so we didn't have the chance to ride this visit.Even with the long waits we had a blast! The rides are great and my teens and husband loved them! Loved the DC area with the big Suicide Squad display....looks like the Halloween time is going to be awesome....hope we can make it back for that!As for the food, what we had (hot dogs/fries) was way overpriced and not great (overcooked and soggy buns). Except for the roasted corn! That was delicious!! One exciting thing was they do have Dole Whip!!I would suggest eating before you arrive, arrive at least 30 minutes before they open to allow time to park, go through security and then get in line to enter the park. Head to your #1 must go one ride first, then enjoy your day.Looking forward to our next visit.....on a non-holiday weekend!",MySosARckStar
50,Fantastic Family Day!,"The best day ever! I did a lot of research before going to Six Flags and there are a few things which worked for us which I recommend: (1) pre-book tickets online (2) Pay for parking online (3) arrive half an hour before opening - you can park and then join the queues to enter the park (4) we pre-purchased the Gold Flash pass - seriously best money spent. We booked it for 2 people (we are a family of 5), so it was $160 on top of entry, however because we arrived at opening, for the first 2 hours the flash pass queues were so short that all 5 of us were allowed to access the ride with the flash pass. (5) each day there are rides which you can't access via the flash pass, so review the rides before you go and then work out the BEST ride you want to go one that you can not access with he flash pass and run for it. We went on 15 rides , most as a family of 5 - there were only 2 rides we needed to split, but it worked ok. The best for us in order: X2; Superman; Tatsu; Goliath; Batman; Riddlers Revenge; Lex Luther... The park attendants were friendly and helpful and the park was clean. We packed a picnic lunch and went back to the car for a rest and food - there were some lovely trees and grass areas so we joined the people picnicking - a good way to save some of the money you have just spent on the flash pass. Seriously, spend the $80 on 1 or 2 passes (which you can share between you) rather than the crappy and overpriced food. Well worth the spend!",kate c
40,Better than I expected actually especially given when we went,"My recommendations for ANYONE visiting are the following.Eat well both before, during and after going to the park. For some of us, we may get light headed after going on a ride and it helps to eat something and not having your stomach feel empty. Also make sure you are hydrated throughout the day(you may want to buy the souvenir bottle, just saying).Now onto the rides. It has about one of every type of roller coaster(stand up = riddler's revenge, wooden = colossus & apocalypse, floorless = scream, flying = tatsue, steel = goliath, suspended = ninja, inverted = batman and a few others) and about 3 water rides if you want to get wet along with a kids section. I myself have not gone on the viper but I've heard that it isn't the most pleasant to go on so if you MUST go on it, do it towards the end of the day, not the beginning).Many of the line's rides have a net above so it helps with keeping you out of the sun for too long. And it goes without saying that yes the food is expensive so you should have extra money available if you want to keep yourself fed let alone well fed.",silver11th
50,Great day out,"Well, what can I say, don't miss this park. It's full of jaw dropping rides. It's one of the best parks anywhere in the world.",Ian B
20,Not what we expected.....,My two sons aged 21 and 17 were so excited to take a day off from Disneyland and visit six flags. The experience was a bit of a letdown for them. They said the park is quite dirty (littered with garbage) and some of the rides were in great need of repair and sprucing up. Two of the major rides were not operating on this visit. They said if you are wanting to compare this park to Disneyland at all in the ways of cleanliness and smooth rides you will be disappointed. Ordering a couple of milkshakes took a good 20 or more minutes. On the upside the people that work there are very helpful and friendly. We opted to rent a car and drive to Santa Clarita and back again to Anaheim as none of the tour buses operated on this day. That again is a big mistake as it took 90 minutes to get there which isn't too bad but it took 3 hours to get back. We should have spent yet another day visiting our favorite place - Disneyland.,Berginator
40,Six Flags is All Business!,"I had the pleasure of visiting this park by myself, which I highly recommend. I also recommend spending the extra money for the Flash Pass. This will get you to the front of every line without the wait, and some of the wait times are 90 minutes or more. There is a great sports bar, centrally located and a great place to grab a drink and meet new friends.I could not tell you what coaster is my favorite, as I liked almost all of them. You must go on:Full Throttle, Goliath, Scream, SUPERMAN: Escape from Krypton, Tatsu, The New Revolution, THE RIDDLER’S RevengeHonestly they are all great. If the only thing that you love about theme parks is the best rides, than Six Flags is where it's at. It is all Thrillers and no Fillers, or silly fluffy distractions. Six Flags is all business when it comes to delivering the adrenaline rush that you have been looking for, again and again.",DamnRodgers
30,The six flag experience,"Great park with great rides,it is very hot like Vegas heat so if you have young children make sure you have plenty drinks!yr not allowed your own drinks there & there's a sign saying no outside drinks allowed in park!!However,U can buy all day souvenir refillable drinks costing around $18 with tax make sure u get that as its value 4money!!Parking all day was $18 after u park up you can get a free shuttle bus that takes u to the gate of the park.The customer service is slow & poor so be prepared to stand in heat for a very long time!!The guest service is rubbish so if you have any problems no point going to them they are as clueless as the guests about the park,offers & services.",Sul S
10,Absolutely horrible experience,"We had huge expectations to Six Flags Magic Mountain but it turned out that these expectations might have been too high.We went in July on a very hot day and not until it was too late we realized there were actually two parks with separate fees and not one. Well, partly our own mistake for not knowing ahead of arriving at the park but we would have liked someone to offer a nice price for both parks instead of selling us just one park.The first ride was X2. We entered the line and had officially just over an hour to stand in line. That's according to signs on the path to the ride. After nearly two hours we got to the front of the line and we now understood this long wait. Too many employees standing around talking to each other or just standing there without assisting guests with the lockers. This caused up to 14 seats out of 28 seats on the ride to be empty.The ride was fun - a lot of fun - but it tore us apart waiting for two hours right in the sun.I kept my mind open and a happy face but in six hours we ended up on a total of four rides. The price? Around $80 per person. One of the water rides was closed which is probably not the best idea in the middle of summer.In general I think I felt like I was part of an old movie. The park seemed old and not very well-maintained. As tourists we had heard that Six Flags was this crazy park with modern rides and lots of fun. I'm not sure if Six Flags Magic Mountain was part of this rumor. But $80 for a somewhat average park with little fun is way overprized.Even the vending machines were crap. I ended up paying for twice the amount of drinks I actually bought. I agreed to $2 a coke but I was charged $4 per bottle. But what am I to do with a foreign cell phone and park employees who have nothing to do with the vending machines?All in all a very big mistake to visit Six Flags. For us it was a waste of money and a waste of our time.",Kim C
30,They should obey their own rules,I visited this place with my wife and kids on August 23rd 2016. The day started very well till about midafternoon when they were shooting a movie at the bugs bunny part which is mainly for kids 3-9years. My kid was excited and was running to one of the rides and my wife was running after him and a six flags employee lady shouted at my wife and son to stop them from going there.I contacted them and submitted a complaint and received a confirmation email that they will answer me within 7 days. Nothing happened.On their web site they mentioned clearly that they do not tolerate offensive language. So why do they shout at paying guests?,Haytham Z
40,"Great coasters, could be imporved.","Coasters are fantastic. Washrooms are revolting. I think it should open earlier to make the most of the cooler temps. Get there early as we avoided most of the queues that way. Should add WIFI, shady waiting areas and clean the washrooms! Leave the little kids at home as there isn't so much for them to do.",lisawal1971
20,Poorly run.,"There's no doubting there are great coaster rides here but there's not much thought to how the park is run. For a start, it doesn't open till 1030 so a lot of the best part of the day is wasted. The new virtual reality Revolution ride goes around half empty because there aren't enough headsets to give everyone between turn arounds, which makes queueing even longer. Queues generally are really long, not just for the rides but food and drink. And places to sit and eat the stuff are few and far between. In short, unless your prepared to pay through the nose to skip the lines with their fast pass, I wouldn't bother going.",street0s
50,13th birthday,"We took my daughter for her 13th birthday. Brought along a friend, and our 3 other children. We had SUCH a great time! We loved all the rides and it wasn't too busy. Our favorite was the new Twisted Colossus. You will NOT be disappointed!",jjcoffman
40,Platinum fast pass is essential,"My son had been looking forward to visiting a Six Flags park for years so expectations were sky high. The whole day was excellent but this was due to one thing; we each had a platinum fast pass. This made you a VIP and the whole family simply walked straight to the front of any queue. Given that it is 40 degrees in the shade and there are no seats or shade for those queuing it just made the whole experience a pleasure rather than torture. For sure they are expensive but I can not stress enough what a difference it made. And how often are you going to go to 6 Flags? Push the boat out.Plus with the fast pass you can do absolutely all of the rides whereas with queuing you will only do five or six maximum. One downside is that because you are not waiting in-line then there is no recovery time which led to one or two of our party getting a bit of motion sickness.Oh, and the rides? Just amazing, of course!",Syd_The_Sloth
50,Great end to our trip to the US,"We ended our two week trip to the US with a visit to Six Flags.The end of August was a perfect time to visit as the US school term had started so the park was quiet.Having said that we had bitten the bullet and paid in advance for the ""Flash Pass"" so didn't have any waits at all throughout the day. This meant we went on all the top rides and a couple of them twice.The only disappointment for us was that X2 was closed for the day.The Virtual Reality coaster was awesome and our adrenaline-junky 13 year old loved the Superman ride.We had also pre-booked the photo pass, but it turned out to be cheaper if bought in the park which was a shame.Overall we had a great day out and can thoroughly recommend Six Flags.",Chris B
30,Old Park. Not so fun in the sun,"This was the 4th park we did in our trip, and I hope that this hasn't tainted our view of it. We got a Flash Pass as we were there for only one day and were not intending on coming back to the part of the US again. We got the gold pass, which reduced wait time by 50%. I wish we upgraded to the platinum as the gold pass still had us waiting 45-60 mins for a ride. This would be ok, if you could book more than one ride at a time, but you can't. The lines were long, and hot. Not a lot of cover on some of them, no misters, and nothing to keep you entertained, Ended up being a VERY LONG day waiting for rides. Was difficult to find our way around as it wasn't overly well signposted. A lot of the rides were older and we ended up having to abandon some rides as they kept breaking down. And as they were a bit older they were a bit more uncomfortable, but the ones we did get on were still super fun. Loved the river rapids, viper, tatsu, riddlers revenge, batman.. and the full throttle ride. We both though we had lost 2 1/2 hours of our lives waiting for the New Revolution and wished we had avoided that. Standing in the heat and sun was not cool. We also wished they told us which rides weren't operating so we weren't wasting our time getting there. It is a mountainous park.. hence the name I guess. So glad we got fitter before we came.",Susan O
40,Wanting to Ride Twisted Collosus,"Back in April of 2016 went to Six Flag Magic Mountain with the intent on riding Twisted Collosus. When I get in seat they are having issue with lap safety bar sensor locking me in. Girl tried to push bar down with a little more force and to no avail I was denied to ride and the girl who was trying to lock me in told me it was because my ""thighs we to big"". So i thought that was odd so I got back in line and in a different seat. Removed wallet and jacket and again denied to ride. I did not understand and felt fat shamed as well. So the follwing week in May i go back to Six Flags Magic Mountan knowng this time i could ride. Again denied and as i was waiting for friends who were able to ride a black lady came down the exit saying thank you Jesus this stomach saved her from a ride that she did no want to get on in the firstplace. We laughed. So with new motivation, i made some adjustments to road bike and got a better set of running shoes and dusted off the weights and commenced to lose some weight and inches. In August the day arrived and i am in line for the back seat ,seat 21, of Twisted Collosus at Six Flags Magic Mountan. 2 people are in front of us and I say a quick prayer. Moment of truth arrives. I get in set, bar comes down, its a no go. Guy pushes down on bar again and looks at ride operator and she has green light from sensor and gives thumbs up and i am good to ride. They give me high 5 and off we go. This is the best ride in the park and being in the back was not forgiving at all. Got off happy and we descide to ride again but in seat 18, get in seat, denied. Switch seats, denied again. I explained I just got off seat 21 10 minutes ago. Again denied. As I am walking away i realize what i did different, i did not pray first. I thanked Jesus for the weightloss and opportunity to at least been able to ride once. I used the negative comment about my thighs as motivation and it still continues to this day for a new goal has been set.I posted this on my Facebook page. I do have exact dates and approximate hours of each vist. I say all of this to hope that management would take into consideration when training there young men and ladies on what they can and can not say to a customer visiting Six Flags Magic Mountan. Pointing out body parts as the reason why a person can not ride an attraction at Six Flags Magic Mountan is unacceptable. A general safety issue answer would have been sufficient. Maybe they were trained or went off script, but regardless pointing out body parts is not acceptable. Thank God I had a positive outcome and was able to ride and enjoyed it.",IWork2CruiseCCL
40,12 year old son loves thrill rides.,The park was a lot of fun. I thought they should have more restaurants indoors. We stayed from opening to close and there was only one indoor restaurant with A/C.,Cindy F
40,Quite expensive,"Great to finally see this, as wanted to visit for years and years. The cost to get in is $67 plus then you need to pay $40 each person for the fast pass. This is the cheapest fast pass option. If you don't get the fast pass, you have no way of getting all of the rides done. Makes for a very expensive day when you have 5 people. Also reduced hours on today we went in Late August, hours were 10.30 till 6pm. The drinks are $14.99 for endless refills for the day.",Gabrielle B
50,More than I expected.,"After reading the reviews, I had low expectations. They were dismissed. The whole day was great, the lines were bearable, the staff friendly and everything was all on schedule. Great day.",Katelyn I
50,The Best roller coasters around!,"Six Flags Magic Mountain has the best roller coasters around including a very thrilling New Revolution - you ride a real roller coaster while wearing a virtual reality headset, it makes it seem as if you are riding in a fighter jet flying through a city fighting off alien invaders!!",Grant H
20,Roulette,"If you have read my review of the water park then you will see I have made references to the theme park.I have visited lots of parks around the world and always book tickets before I travel, most parks will tell you of planned outages of rides so you can make a decision on whether yoi go or not. With Six Flags you oh your money and take the chance on what you will get on the day.We went today and have a season pass (we are from UK but it's the same price to have a season pass than have a 2 days pass) and when we turned up there were signs advising 4 of the rides ( the best ones) were closed. We checked if they would be open during our stay and due to planned maintenance they will be closed for the rest of the season (apart from possible Saturday's) most parks carry out planned work outside of park seasons to limit customer experience but it seem at Six Flags they do it when ever they want! There were no people working on the rides, no gated areas or vans etc just unmanned rides.Cynthia at guest relations in this park was as helpful as her colleagues in Hurricane Harbour ( see my other review)Needless to say the cost of the day is not worth it when so many rides are closed.They operate a no refund or return pass day so you pay your money and risk what you get!!It's a shame as they do have some of the best rides available for thrill seekers if they are open!!Parking is expensiveThe staff try to up sell at every given momentMost food stalls are not open so trying to get a drink refill is like queuing for a ride!?If you don't mind rides out of order, rude staff and high prices then its well worth a visit.I won't be going back .",Sirrah4941
50,Fun for everyone!,"This was another trip I went on with my cousins. We stayed the entire day! I must've gone on 9 rides, and I had a lot of fun doing it too!At first I wasn't sure of what I would think of Six Flags as I hadn't been there in a long time (think a decade easy). The lines weren't bad for half of the day since we got there close to opening time!I think the only things that bothered me about the place were the price of food ($13 for a black bean burger and baby carrots! (by the way, pizza cost about the same amount)), and the lack of communication when the ride we were waiting to go on had major delays.Still, I would recommend this place to anyone who's a thrill-seeker and loves roller coaster rides. It's a blast!",QuillyO
50,Internationals - be sure you do your reasearch,"Whilst we're very glad we went and had a total blast, I wasn't happy with the cost of the flash pass versus actual benefits. I'm sure when the park is busy and the queues enormous it would be of benefit, but we seriously the cues were no more than 10 minutes tops. With 2 young kids 12 & 14 we actually didn't mind lining up to let our heads and stomachs settle before more thrills. Totally awesome place and with a little more research before we went and I probably wouldn't have bought the platinum passes ($390 for 3). My only other criticism and I'll temper that again with the time we went because it was quiet, was the lack of food places open. Would we go again if visiting California - most definitely we had an awesome time!",Matt S

The grounds were very kept and the staff was very helpful in assisting us with finding things. Just like any other theme park, the prices for food and drinks are extremely high. I would recommend drinking plenty water to remain hydrated while there.",Todd W
40,Awesome roller coasters,"This is a ""hard ride"" roller coaster park. If you love roller coasters then this is the place. We were there on a day that wasn't that busy but got the platinum passes just because it was a one off visit for us. The amount of time it took just to get thru the short line for the passes probably didn't make it worth it. Having said that we were able to ride all the rides we wanted to and had an awesome day. Tatsu is insanely good - a must do. Best coaster I have ever ridden",Craig L
50,Birthday Fun,"Took my 13 year old and his sister to experience Magic Mountain for the first time! He loved all the rides and to tell you the truth, the longest we waited was 15-20 minutes. A great day that was full of rides and fun. One family tip, but a refillable drink, it was worth the $15 because we filled it 7-8 times through out the day! Not for the faint of heart, a true adventure riders paradise!",Vivdog75
30,Straight to the point rides.,"Fun park for adults! Super expensive food (obviously) and they don't allow any outside food in the park. Only complaint is the long lines, which are expected, but nothing goes into the wait. Sometimes you're not even fully shaded from the sun, there's nothing to do while you wait, nothing to look at. No mist machines to cool down. Everything feels sort of barren.",WorldCitizenHDF
20,Run Down,"We came here for our 16 year old twins enjoyment. They loved the coasters but the place on the whole is run down and in disrepair. We bought our tickets online for $54 USD so thankfully I didn't have to pay full price. I do wish they would consider a rider/non rider rate though, for those parents or people who don't ride. In my opinion, my husband and I donated over $100 to the place as we did nothing but sit on benches the entire day. Park was crowded on a 104 degree day which was surprising. Lines weren't terrible. Wait times posted were NEVER what they said they were. 90 minute wait times seemed to average about 30 mins actual wait time or 15 min posted wait times could end up being 60. There was no rhyme or reason. You can't take ANY food or drink in and the restaurants etc. were dirty, over crowded and not very good. All around the park we saw overflowing garbages, garbage on the ground. We found that often times there was a wafting smell of garbage when we were sitting and waiting. No staff around the parks to help if you needed directions etc. 5 of the coasters that my boys tried to get on were broke down. That said, they did get on the coasters they wanted to and very much enjoyed them . Get the refillable cup, it saves you tons of money even if you just get it filled with ice water everytime. Bottled water 2 for $6. Refillable cup $15.99. I had a coupon so they were $13.99 each. Once at this place was enough for us. We won't return here.",Disneylovers2000
40,Timing is everything and Size matters,We used the website 'isitpacked' to determine when to go (we chose a ghost town day) and it worked for us. We were able to experience the entire park well within their operating hours and never queue more than 10 minutes for any ride. Some rides were so quiet we had to wait for other riders to arrive to fill them up. That said being a big guy (265 pounds/120kg and 6 ft) I was not able to ride Riddler or Batman and had to be seated in a modified seat for Scream. All other rides no problem. The park itself is not the cleanest especially the pre ride areas. Needs a good scrub. Enjoyed ourselves and both my wife and felt Goliath was the most extreme coaster esp at the end of the ride where g forces cause a near blackout with Doom Drop being the most extreme experience. We got discounts ticket by buying online and using a promo code we got from the retailmenot app.,NauticalVoyager
50,Fun!!!,"it was 22 year since the last time I visited Magic Mountain, and i still love it!!!I visited with my 12 year old daughter and we had a blast!! My first ride was Goliath and when i came down i was i little dizzy ,but with so much adrenaling still flowing!!New rides are so much fun..Tatsu is the best!!!This is a must if you are in the Los Angeles Area.",Juan Carlos Coronado
40,Busy park with great roller coasters,"Be prepared to wait in line. We had to wait to park, then wait again to have our bags searched, yet again to present our passes to gain entrance to the park. The waiting didn't stop there. If you need a drink, you have to wait. Want to eat? Another wait. Lines for the roller coasters averaged about an hour wait. The coasters were worth the wait! Many great coasters in this park but coupled with waiting for everthing else it was a little frustrating.",hawaiimom03
30,Disappointed for me,"Our conclusion: ""Six Flags is not Disney""'Organization, perfection, places to eat, beverages, cleanness, lines, lines waiting time, nothing is like we are used to when we go to a Disney Park.",cecilia cook
50,"Thrills, Thrills and more Thrills!",This is the place to come if you love thrill rides. The roller coasters here are EXTREME thrill rides and will have your heart pounding every second. If you have small children there is a Bugs bunny land with a few rides however not enough for an entire day's worth of excitement for very young children. There is also a few fair/carnival type rides in the park which are fun too.,marsbar112
20,Disappointed,"After getting so many compliments about this place, i was bummed the minute i got there. During security check they found snacks in our bags and asked us to eat it outside, take it back to the car(which is a long way considering they close @6) or throw it away. Not only is this against the environment but its also against all human rules. I've been to multiple parks around the world that have signs ""no outside food allowed"" but they check our bags and see the snacks themselves and let us in. We had to throw away all the snacks we've gotten for the kids that i still feel bad for throwing. They don't even store it for you. Besides that, they abuse the consumer by forcing them to buy the food they offer. Maybe i'm on a strict diet/budget? Absolutely no consideration whatsoever!! The rides were insane but the whole experience was disappointing. Also, 3 of the most thrilling rides were down, maybe it was just a bad day but still that contributed to the poor experience. Some of their queues were in direct sunlight, no fans provided. Even my sister got a little bit dizzy. And hey they have an application but no wifi in the premises! 👎",Foz B
40,Fun packed Thrill day,"Of all the parks we visited, SixFlags was the most thrill packed. The number of fast rides was incredible and we barely made it round them all in one day. It also nearly killed us (one 50 yr old, one 16 and one 14). But was fun trying 😀We went in the 3rd week in August, just after the US kids went back to school so the park was far quieter than normal, that said the 3D Revolution ride still had a 90 min wait !We got Flash Passes, though could probably have survived without if we had avoided 3D Revolution, but with them were able to do all the rides in the day 10.30-18.00 so quite short time. I would go for the Gold not Platinum pass personally, as it was quiet enough to do most things in the normal queues.It's obvious Six Flags focuses mainly on the ride aspect, as the site was nowhere near as nice as Universal, and not a touch on Disney (see other reviews), but that said the rides were a huge leap forward in ""Thrill"" than any of the others. But be warned, not much else for non thrill lovers to do in my opinion. Food and shopping was a lot less too, but that didn't worry us.Careful with paying for Photo Day Passes, most of the rides (it seemed to me) didn't have photos being taken.",Rob G
50,A Great time!,"My 10 year old son absolutely had the time of his life at Six Flags. We stayed to the very last minute! Spacious, mostly friendly staff. Lots of fast food but I was impressed that one stand had fresh fruit and pickles! So happy! The fast passes are very expensive. Had a great time!",Sophia M
30,"Without flash pass it's a long day, and with it it's expensive!","We arrived and having pre paid our parking we sailed through, arriving for opening. It was a really hot day and the park don't overly consider that when you are queuing with misters and shade like Disney and Universal do. However this is a park for extreme coasters and the ones we managed to ride were certainly excellent. X2 being the best and Superman a thrilling fast ride, but sadly Batman wasn't in operation which affects our experience. Without the fast pass and considering the heat we didn't work through many other rides before leaving.The park was a little scruffy and could do with some care and maintenance in the public areas and we noticed a lot of stalls and food counters closed which was surprising in the middle of summer. It just felt like people walked from 1 coaster to another without experiencing the park.We had some nachos which were nice and the jalepenos very hot, as well as a nice frozen lemonade and dippy dots.With some care and attention this park could be excellent but lets itself down on the simplest of things to correct.",stuey44
50,Great park.,"I finally took the time to visit Magic Mountain. It was great! Although some of the rides were closed, I did enjoy most of them. There was only a couple of things I didn't like. One, the funicular going up to the top of that steep hill by Ninja was closed...so I had to walk up that steep hill! VERY EXHAUSTING to say the least. Secondly, the water in the water fountains tasted SO HORRIBLE! It was SO HOT the day I went and it'd have been nice to be able to keep hydrated w/some good water but the fountains barely let out a trickle of water and the ones I COULD drink out of or fill my bottle up with, the water was WARM and it tasted SO RANCID it was just deplorable! I HOPE they've gotten this problem fixed.Other than that, my day was very exhausting due to the heat. I hope to go again some time but prob will go when it's spring time and hopefully not so hot!It's so awesome that Wendy's hamburgers is just at the bottom of the driveway going up into the parking area and they're open at 7am so it was awesome I got some cheap eats before going into the park and after I left the park too!The rides in the park were great. Not crowded at all so we could ride multiple times if we wanted...awesome! I was there to ride Revolution but unfortunately, it was closed for maintenance, as was X and even Scream closed when I walked over to it so it was 'down' for a good while. I guess that'll leave me things to do next time!",cecilschick
40,Park of Steel,"When you pull up all you see are these beautiful coasters of steel. I recommend the flash pass if you only have one day at the park. I got to ride all the roller coaster thanks to the flash pass. Favorite rides 1)X2 2)Twisted Colossus 3)Tatsu. FYI WORST RIDE the green lantern ride is very intense and in fact hurts to ride, don't ride it unless you have a real strong neck. Overall a very good experience at the park glad I was able to do everything. If i ever get back to the LA area I will defiantly be back!",matt4jezus
40,Only with Flash Pass!!,"You will NEED Flash Pass if you really want to enjoy your day in this park, especially in a hot summer day. In the Beginning we started the day without Flash Pass because we thought we wouldn't need it. But changed fast our minds when we noticed that we had to wait 90 - 120 minutes under the hot sun for a ride. There are three different types of Flash Pass. We choose the most expensive one, wich cost 130$ each. Hower it reduces the waiting time 90%! In the 6-7 hours we were in the Park we were able to ride 9 attractions and ate relaxed. Without the Flash pass you aren't even able to ride 4 Rollercoasters and you are constantly waiting.I rated the attractions we did:1. Superman 9/10 If you love speed, this Rollercoaster is definitely for you! Fastes rollercoaster ever! But could be longer..2. Full Throttle 9/10 Really fast and nice loopings and a little surprise during the ride.3. Tatsu 8/10 Very fast. Constantly upside down. Thrilling.4. Goliath 8/10 No loopings but fast and with adrenaline5. Drop of Doom (Tower) 8/10 Very high and nice sensation.6. The Riddler's Revenge 7/10 Cool loopings and speed7. The new revolution 6/10 You get glasses were you are in a virtual game. It's ok. Bad graphics.8. Viper 5/10 Loopings. Too much vibrations. Not really fast. Bad Rollercoaster9. Roaring Rapids 5/10 Water Rollercoaster. You get wet but it's not interesting at all and absolutely not fast! BoringAttention! For some attractions we have to pay extra! For example: X2, Sling Shot, Go carts, Skydiving..Food and drinks are very expensive and you can't bring food or drink from home!You definitely can have a super awesome day in Six Flags.. If you are ready to spend a lot of money.",Mr C
40,Only with Flash Pass,"This theme parc has very nice adrenaline high rollercoasters, which you only can enjoy if you have a flashpass which avoids you to wait for hours on the lane. But the negative point is, everything's extremely expensive!!",Jo F
20,Flash pass,"Bought the flash pass to skip the lines. Very expensive, but very little wait. Walked to the far end of the park stopping at several coasters, when the flash pass quit working. We had to walk 30 minutes in 100 degree to try and find the flash pass stand. All they offer was a trip to the front of the line. (Wait I was already getting that with the flash pass). Piece of advice for six flags>don't sell products that don't work. Ruined half our day. Refund please.",SeattleWanderer214
40,Flash pass,Going in the summer it will be packed with long lines that's a given.. So we decided on getting the flash pass but be warned it is very expensive and there are different tiers of flash pass.. We payed for the $75 one and it was only good for like 9 rides and some of them were good for only one time...if they can get away with screwing you over they will!,Brenda B
50,KB,"Best roller coaster, thrill ride park bar none. They also have a kids section for younger kids but this is a thrill seekers destination. Food is pricey but no more than any other amusement park. They allow sealed bottles of water in but no outside food which is rough when you have dietary issues.",Kyle B
50,Just have the right expectation,"I'm 29, my gf 25. We are from Europe and we loved our visit to Magic Mountain! To be honest, I was really worried visiting this place because of all these negative comments here in tripadvisor. I even thought, maybe the positive ones are created by Magic Mountain own ppl or by ones they know.I think negative comments are caused by wrong expectation or it's just whining.Just be ready that if you have the regular pass, you have to wait in the line. We visited this place on Friday 12. August, we arrived at 11:30 and left 20:15. We made 10 rides (all of them were max. thrills).To buy the tickets and to get into the park took 10 min.Since it was sunny, we brought with us 10 bottles of water, a sun cream and backpack (safe to leave it next to the exit area before the ride. No need to rent the locker). Wallet and phone were in the pocket all the time.The longest we waited in a queue was about 1h30min (Goliath and X2 - morning and evening were not so busy) the shortest time was 10 min.Waiting in a queue wasn't the favorite part, but not something extremely difficult - it was long, with curves and you didn't stand in one place for very long time (similar system with Universal Studio). Maybe it's just me, but all the rides were so awesome that after the ride you even forgot the time you waited in a queue.Restrooms were not in a condition as in high class restaurant. It was comparable with busy fast food restrooms.Staff were young, not super motivated, but they did their job. Maybe not the most interesting job in the world and they were not smiling all the time, but nothing to compain about - showed when and where to go, checked if your seat is secured and started the rollercoaster.Couple of suggestions:1. Seems like flash pass owners really had advantage in a queue. If you really don't like to wait, you want to take most out of the park and don't have sorry to spend this extra, go for it. With regular pass you don't have enough time to ride with all the rollercoasters in a day.2. Take lots of water with you, you can refill them with water if you want. Don't bring valuable stuff with you and you can leave your backpack next to every rollercoaster exit area before you have your ride.3. Store next to main entrance has cool AC in the room and if the heat is too bad you can go there to cool down and maybe to buy some snacks. There is hardly no lines in there4. Have a strong breakfast. We managed to go through the day by buying only small snacks (me and my gf spent inside of the park only 25 usd).5. Go as early as possible and stay until they tell you that it's it for a day, if you have only one day to be there6. NB! Early in the morning and after 18:30 there are really short queues. We managed to have 3 rides between 18:30-20:00.",Kaarel K
10,Waste of money! Go to Disneyland or Universal Studios instead,"My husband and I just came back from a terrible experience at this stupid ""amusement"" park. It was everything but amusing...We love scary rides and had heard a lot about this place so decided to go. I'll start with saying that the people that work there are extremely lazy, rude and apparently enjoy making peoples' lives harder. We stayed there all day (from 10:30am to 6:30pm) and only got to go on four rides; we spent most of the time under the hot sun in super long lines, all because the people that work there have no managing skills whatsoever, they would leave four to six seats empty on each ride just because they were too lazy to shout ""any groups of 4?"" or ""any 2s?"". Before every ride they tell you to store your backpack in the lockers provided which you have to pay for. Only later you find out that in some rides, depending on how the staff members are feeling, you can simply leave your backpack near them and pick it up later. We spent $10 for two lockers (the locker lasts two hours so you have to pay for a new one every two hours which equals to every ride, considering that one line for one ride can take you up to exactly 2 hours). To make you understand how bad the management is there: the first locker we purchased wouldn't unblock after the ride was over, so we called the girl that was working there who then called someone else in charge of the lockers. We had to wait half an hour for that person to arrive and open that freaking locker! After that we were already over the whole thing, I wanted to leave and get my money back but my husband wanted to give it another try. So we did. We waited and waited and waited in line, that's all we did. We kept seeing empty seats on rides, they made my husband hop off the ride to purchase another locker just to store the tiny fanny pack he was wearing around his waist! He asked to the guy if he could just put it on the side but the guy said no so we had to unbuckle, get a locker, store the fanny pack and go back to the ride and guess what, the guy told us we had to wait for the next one.We have been to Disneyland two days ago and Universal Studios the day before that. We didn't purchase any fast pass, the parks were both packed but waiting in line wasn't a problem because the workers knew what they were doing and tried all their best to make us feel comfortable and make the line move fast. They were polite, organized and good employees.Six Flags sucks; they should go to Disneyland and learn from them.",Rachele C
30,Good If You Like Extreme Rides,"I used to love high speed roller coasters. Now that I'm 55 I realize that I don't like them so much anymore! Magic Mountain is a good place if you like those kinds of rides. They definitely have lots of ""maximum"" coasters. I hadn't been to Magic Mountain in over 20 years so things had definitely changed. First, I thought that the prices were a bit steep. $20 to park??? Small bottles of water (20 oz.) are $3 and a Coke in a cup is about $5. I think that charging this much for drinks is robbery. Second, the place needs a facelift. It's showing its age in several places. For example, the restrooms are in dire need of being refurbished. In addition, they need to provide a little more shade. When you are waiting to go through the metal detector, there is no shade at all and that line can take 15 minutes or longer. If you go in the Summer when it's hot, you will be extremely warm as you get baked in the sun waiting in that line. Overall, it's a good place if you are a coaster fan.",Kingsfan
20,Be careful sneaking in food,"If not for their ban on outside food I would give Six Flags 4 stars.Six Flags is in a location that is further inland (in the desert where it's hotter) compared to other amusement parks in Southern California. They won't let you bring your own food because they want you to pay their inflated prices.They open up your backpack at security, take away any outside food they find and then send you on your way so you can empty out your wallet for a snack.The vending machines will charge you $3.50 for a bottle of water. The frozen lemonade costs $7, etc. This is much higher than you'll see at Disneyland or Knott's Berry Farm. All of this feels like a scam.The rollercoaster are good and fun, but the prices are totally inflated. My advice- wear cargo shorts and sneak in a burrito in your shorts pocket.",ESL Teacher
40,Brilliant rollercoasters,"Visited magic mountain for the first time in July and we had a blast! (Just a pity we visited on the hottest day of the year). The park is huge and the queues aren't too long. We loved all the attractions that we went on, but particularly the green lantern and the drop zone. As much as the rollercoasters are great, things would be better if the staff were better organised, they can be slow getting people on the rollercoasters and also slow at serving in the food/drink places. I think they would also benefit from having cooling stations when queuing for rides because the heat was unbearable! I would definitely visit six flags magic mountain again and I recommend it for those who love thrill rides",Jen

40,New VR Coaster!,"Perfect for older kids (teens) and younger children. Many things to do, such as rides and shows. It is a fun experience but the lines were fairly long. Many people used the ""Flash Pass"" or the fast pass so that was a bit inconvenient.",Clarisse W
20,Visit saved by the rides only,"Visited the park today and was bitterly disappointed with most aspects of the park.The rides are the only saving grace for six flags. I can only thank the ride engineers and designers for making the extortionate amount of money which our visit cost.When arriving at the park we were rather coldy greeted by a parking attendant who asked for $20 for parking. (Disney is only $18). This $20 means you park at the bottom of a large hill and a free bus runs every maybe 10 minutes so you would queue for upto 30 minutes in the blistering sun with no shade what so ever.After hiking to the gate we were greeted by a large queue for going through roughly 15 metal detectors and bag searches. Once this slow line moved through we went into an even bigger queue for entry to the park.Now im no genuis but even i know that if you have people queue wherever they want the queue moves alot slower when they try to merge into one turnstile. When we arrived at the turnstile after 50 minutes in the morning sun with little to no shade we were informed we could not enter with the go la cards we had purchased. We had to leave the queue and go get normal tickets.In 2016 how hard would it be to find a system in which a ticket with a qr code can be scanned. There entryngates struggled with even simlle bar codes. My phine is more advanced than any of their systems. So from entering through the security line we waited over an hour and a half to enter the park gates.If any of the staff for the park took one look at a disney park they would learn some valuable and necessary lessons.Upon entering the disappointment and anger grew further. There are zero staff in the park other than when you board the ride cars.The toilets were disgraceful and the cleaning staff should be ashed of the standard in which the toilets are maintained over the whole park.As a guy im not picky when using a toilet but even i was disgusted at the facilities.The next chapter revolves around the abomination of a cue line in which this park provides. How hard isit to have a sysyem in which you can update a queue time. We entered x2 first in the park and walked past a sign saying 1 hour wait from this point. We got off the ride nearly 2 hours later. The ride was brilliant. But the sunstroke and dehydration was abit harder to cope with. The limited amount of shade means that people in the queue are adamant to move forwards until they can move to the next shaded area. How hard isit to put a shade over a cue for your flagship ride or any ride for that matter.The staff when entering the ride area were mostly young adults no older than 21. Not one staff member cared about the people of even smiled. Unless they were chatting of having a joke with their fellow staff members. This was the story of the whole day. The staff are incosiderate, rude and so lackadaisical it was beyond a joke.Now being a larger fellow i appreciate the facility at every other theme park i have ever visited of having test seats before entering the ride. When queueing over 2 hours for some rides and having the question in your mind of am i even going to fit is beyond belief. Once wedged into the small seat i asked a staff memeber if it was locked securely to be responded with yeah you should be fine.Once thay was over we headed for some lunch. That was shocking. The fish and chips was actually quite nice. But 12 dollars for a meal which was similar to school lunch then an extra 5 dollars for a drink is daylight robbery. We waited over 40 minutes for a simple fish and chips. A fast food service it definatly is not.At the end of the day when leaving the park you will be greeted with only 1 gate for exiting. This would not a problem but we were travelling with a guest in a mobility scooter. When you find the gate for them to exit you will find that the only space for them to exit, is on the opposite side of the whole crowd.In summary for my day at six flags 'hellish' mountain there are some key points which need addressing instantly.1. Dont charge extortionate amounts for parking and give no facilities.2. Open all gates on the entry gate when people wait nearly 2 hours.3. Employ some proper staff and teach them what professionalism is. Not college students.4. Teach your cleaning staff how to clean public areas and toilets.5. Put a test seat at the entry to every ride or atleast a staff member.6. Actually have some disability friendly entry and exit points for the park.I will not be returning to this park even though the rides themselves redeemed the park somewhat.The owners and managers of this park need to take a good hard look at disney in so many ways. This park could be amazing but is presently lackluster. After previously visiting disney parks around the world this park is an insult.Unless you have a spare $150 dollars per person burning a hole in your pocket and enjoy long cues, dirty toilets, sun stroke, dehydration, unproffesional staff and being lied to DO NOT GO TO SIX FLAGS MSGIC MOUNTAIN.As a side note the rollercoasters were amazing when actually on them.",Jason W
40,Summer Fun at Six Flags,"Fun place to come and hang out if you are a thrill seeker or have kids that love these places. With a Six Flags Annual Pass or Membership you can come play at any Six Flags theme park. Even if you are not into the rides there are other things to do and see. There's even a water park next door (separate admission) for those unbearably hot Southern California days. The lines can be ridiculously long but if you plan your visit well, you can manage to avoid lines and get on the rides with a relatively reasonable wait-time. There are a lot of food options in the park but not the healthiest. There are a lot of options outside the park and right down Magic Mtn Parkway.",flygirl926
30,"Great Coasters, LONG Lines","We came here on a Tuesday thinking it would be a slower day of the week. ..we were wrong! It was line ups to get in the park with the vehicle right in the morning when it opened, line ups to pay, line ups for security and line ups to get in the park. Then each roller coaster was between an hour and 1.5 hours of a line up. The flash pass was just too expensive for regular joe's so we just spent the day waiting. Ands I think the $80 for one day but only $120 for a season pass means that it's just a money grab from tourists. And making a season pass so cheap results in ridiculous lines! The coasters were awesome though, just wish we could have gone on more!",Mandywey
40,Fun for all ages,"I have to start with saying I own a membership pass for all my family members, 2 adults and 2 kids under 8. The membership for all is under $30 each month and we use the pass as much as we can. 2 of the passes include free parking all year. It def beats $100/ mo passes somewhere else. Every summer we go to Hurricane Harbor at least 10-15 times. Six flags has had a major upgrade in new rides and new eateries. They have rides for all ages and the new live bands that play in front of the full throttle ride are always nice to hear. I feel the park would be even better if they can renovate/ upgrade most of their restrooms in my opinion. Some are in dire need of new hinges and such. The park seems more clean than some years back but I have hopes that it will get better. The park provides a picnic area by the parking area and the shuttles don't take as long as they used to to pick up and drop off guests. I def don't come here for kid shows or character sites as they are rare to see. My kids love the kids play area. They've opened up more rides and baby roller coasters which my kids love so it's worth it for me.Overall the park has all kinds of rides for all ages and fair like games for prizes. I strongly suggest a year pass or membership if you live in the neighboring area.",Jasmine A
50,Family fun,"Really fun day with the kids. We were not brave enough for the biggest rides as my kids are only 6 and 9 but their favorites were batman, twisted colossus, and roaring Rapids.",Inspire573689
40,Okay Park,"This park would be an excellent suggestion for people who love rollercoasters and thrill rides. Excellent for teens, and adults. I wouldn't suggest taking a six or seven year old here. For the price, it wouldn't be worth if unless you rode all or most of the rides.The lines are FOREVER so be prepared.",Madison N
20,I feel I got robbed,"Basically, Six Flags Magic Mountain is a great place for those in search of adrenaline. However, be prepared to reach deeply in your pocket. First, 20 USD for parking. I can live with it. Entry: 80 USD each, only for Magic Mountain. If you want the water slides, it's 40 USD more. Once we were in, the waiting time varied from 90 to 120 minutes at each ride. So we went to by a Flash Pass, wich allows you to cut the wait, they say. The Flash Pass costs between 50 USD and 145 USD, according to the amount of time you want to cut. We took a 50 USD pass, wich do not allow to reserve more than one ride at the time, so it's fine for the first 1 or 2 rides, but does not give anything afterwards since you already had time to walk the park while waiting. So I guess that the 145 USD Pass is better, but it's still a lot. At this price, we would expect that everything is free, but there are some rides you have to pay up to 35 USD (example: carting, reverse bungee). The food is also very pricy. For a family of 4, take a mortgage on your house if you plan to go there. Try Universal Sudios instead.",Cassidy
40,Roller Coaster Heaven...need flash pass,"We went on Tuesday August 2nd and it was busy but not until around 11:30. If you get there early you can probably ride 3 rides with little wait. We did get platinum flash passes ($130 ea) but didn't need them for first hour of park opening. Get there early bc the lines to get in are long...unless you have a discover card, that line was short and saved us at least 40 min. We were able to ride all but one major coaster bc it was shut down. We were there from 10:30-6:30. Without the platinum pass we never could have done that. The platinum pass was essential to making the day bearable with the heat and hills; we could walk at a leisurely pace and wait in the long lines for 2 different meals and a snack. Food lines were long, but there was a variety of different option. I can't even imagine what this park is like on the weekends.If you only have one day I highly recommend the platinum flash pass so you can go at your own pace and enjoy all the rides.",4_Amber
40,Hot day at the park.,Overall we enjoyed the park but it was super hot. Used the standard fast pass and it was worth the extra funds. Staying hydrated is a task and it turned out getting the refillable cups would have been a better deal. Not many good drinking fountains and the water is not the best. Clean park overall and the staff was helpful. The big coasters are very good. Too good in a couple of cases and a couple of us has to take a break and let our stomachs come back to earth. Bring good sunscreen and hats!,Bryan M
30,Rides Rock but Cleanliness and line stink,The park and the rides are second-to-none the roller coasters are unbelievable fun at last anywhere from 10 seconds to 60 seconds and they're just the best in the world. When it comes to the lines there's a line to get your tickets a line to get in the park and as soon as you get in the park there's a line to use the bathroom the bathroom is too small for the size of the public they have and it smells and it's dirty and it has no paper towels. We noticed the cleanliness problem throughout the park with things that are old and unpainted or trash around the eating areas and Johnny Rockets even smelled in the eating areas. We got the fast pass so our lines weren't too bad but the lines for food and the lines for people they didn't have the fast pass even on a weekday or about an hour plus long on average I would say for the good rides. If you can afford the fast pass and you're going for roller coasters Magic Mountain is a must the rest so-so.,Paul O
50,"If you want to chill out and forget about life, this is the place","Cool place, incredible roller coasters. They must just improve the service if you compare with Disney or Universal, however the roller coaster are the best ones",Juliano1976
40,Roller coasters galore,"Magic Mountain is a great place for those who love thrill rides, because they have more roller coasters than any other amusement park that I've seen. The lines get pretty long on the most popular rides, but there is a free Six Flags App you can get on your phone, which will tell you how long a line is on any given ride. You are not allowed to bring in your own food or drink, with the exception of water, which is not clarified on their website. If you bring your own clear container, you can bring it in and re-fill it at the numerous drinking fountains found throughout the park. I gave it a 4 out of 5 mainly for the cost of food and drinks. A cup of soda costs over $4, which is why I recommend bringing a water bottle. You can purchase a Six Flags refillable bottle for about $16, which gives you free re-fills all day, and 99 cent refills for the rest of the season. Or you can purchase a season bottle for $23 and get free refills all season long. Overall, we really enjoy it for the rides, but we try not to eat in the park, due to the cost.",KMTW
40,Coaster Heaven!,"If you love coasters...you will LOVE this park. We come here every year and every year I say we need to come more often. A coaster dream...we love this park.The staff were nice and helpful when needed.Guest relations was a little difficult to deal with. I had a doctor's not, which is required for a ride assistance pass, but they were still very difficult to deal with. Meanwhile, I heard people talking in line and joking that they ""got away with hand writing a note in the hotel the night before"". That made me mad because I legitimately had one and I got grief. That tells me everyone is not trained equally. That's annoying when you're trying to do the right thing.The other bad thing was the bees. There were bees everywhere and when I asked the staff there they had no answer except ""soda machines"". That's a terrible answer because all theme parks have soda machines and they don't have bees.",Tracy C
40,Best Six Flags park,"Not only does this park have the most roller coasters in the world but most of them are world class coasters. My favorite is X2, a 4D coaster that spins you around as you fly down the track. Twisted colossus is a amazing RMC wooden coaster. Rides like Tatsu, Scream, Riddlers Revenge, Superman, Goliath, Apocalypse, Full Throttle, Batman, ninja, and The new revolutions are great rides as well. The only bad ones are Viper, Green Lantern, and gold rusher which I highly recommend not riding.The park is easy to navigate for the most park if it wasn't for the giant hill/mountain in the middle of the park but it does provide good views. The park still feels like a six flags park but still has some iconic locations. The flat rides and the new drop tower are also very fun. Sadly there are not a lot for kids at this park. The park is very clean but can get very crowded during certain seasons. The food is mediocre at best which is a really disappointing. Six Flags Magic mountain is a must do on any thrill seekers to do list and a great destination for anyone wanting to have fun in the LA area. However for kids a park like Disneyland, California's Adventure, or Knotts Berry Farm is the better choice. Very glad I got to visit and I don't regret any minute of it. Great Park",Ben S
40,Go for the roller coasters,"We went on a Monday and Tuesday July 25-26. We were able to ride everything except the VR roller coaster (do NOT recommend because of the wait time). The rides are fantastic! We did not get flash passes. Tatsu was our favorite and we rode it 2x. It's best to ride the big rides early morning or late evening as the lines are longest between noon and 6pm.Viper, scream, ninja and gold rusher are all great roller coasters that you can walk on and ride anytime. Even Goliath had fairly short wait time and it is awesome.Our favorites were full throttle, tatsu, Goliath. X2 is wild and worth riding but didn't like that you had to rent a locker for your stuff.We got two refillable drink cups for the four of us and highly recommend this since it was hot.Don't recommend green lantern, tidal wave and the VR roller coaster. We waited in line for 45 min for tidal wave before the ride broke down. The hired chimps that worked tidal wave had only one working raft which was totally ridiculous and the wait time per the app was supposed to be only 20 min. Don't trust the app. Roaring Rapids was also too short of a ride for the 40 minutes we waited to ride it.",Steven S
30,"No Atmosphere, but rides were great.","We went to the park in the middle of summer and school holidays, queue's weren't too long however there is no shade while waiting to go on the rides as my wife got heat stroke. Rides were amazing, however you didn't feel like you were anywhere wow, no atmosphere, music and staff were almost like they were forced to be there. The only happy person I encountered was the security checking our bags.Food options are very poor and very poor quality for the price you pay and the attendants were very incompetent. We ordered a large coke and I had to explain to the lady what a large coke was.....and then was very slow to get it. Later on we got an actual meal and a bottle of water, but they never gave the bottle, so I told the guy I didn't get it, and he just stood there looking at me like he did not know what to do. After a few awkward moments, I had to grab a lady beside him to say I didn't get my water. Just very odd and sadly we encountered this behaviour in another six flags location.Rides definitely worth it, but if you want to bring kids to a place with some atmosphere that feels like fun from the moment you walk in, look elsewhere.",buratto76
20,Not a scratch on Universal / Disney,I visited the park on Wednesday 27 July. 4 hour queue for Revolution - over heated head sets... no information.....general lack of shade when standing in line....rides not available and generally feel of a neglected park. For the money I spent including flash pass ...it wasn't worth it.Won't be going back.,raj0ne
10,Rip off and very poor service,"Be extremely careful on what you buy on their web site. They offer a variety of plans that are very confusing, instead por favor making it simple, this company intentionally tries to make you buy passes that you actually don't need or are subject to other purchases. Once we realized that what we bought, all they said is that it was our mistake and that they have a non refundable policy, that's presented on very small letter.Our sincere recommendation, don't waste your money on this park, there're lots of better choices in the Los Angeles area.",Alfredo M
50,We were Surprised.,"Yea, when we first pulled up to the park, we were approached bye the Helpful Honda People. Being's we own a Honda they helped us by Paying for r Parking and giving us a pass allowing us to enter the park Early. That made r Day because we got to ride almost all the rides befor the Park opened. HOW COOL WAS THAT.",Dean O
30,Awesome rides but pathetic food,"I've been to Six Flags about four times and I don't usually buy food there. However, on my fourth visit, my friends and I decided to get lunch. Big waste of money, we went to ... and got CHEESEburgers. When I looked in my burger, the CHEESE in CHEESEburger was missing and the fries were cold. Everything is overpriced, which I expected. Fun fact: Daisan waterbottle costs $4.50! On the bright side, the rides are awesome!! I wasn't dissapointed by all of the thrilling rides:) If you are going to visit the park soon, enjoy and eat before entering the park!",h0nestreviews800
40,Magic park but with faults,"We visited Magic mountain on a Monday in July and magic is an appropriate description. The coasters are amazing so many to choose from you are spoiled for choice. We went straight to x2 after park opened and got on straightaway. By time we got to the new revolution the queue was 2 hours do we skipped it completely. Don't think we missed anything. Then on to Tatsu 15 min wait up to ninja straight on though it wasn't great. Down to riddler straight on. Twisted Colossis longest wait 45 mins but awesome. Goliath next had to wait 20 mins amazing coaster, full throttle was longest and hottest queue 45 mins but it was worth it. Viper next straight on wished we hadn't bothered it was awful sore and felt like I was going to fall out of it.Negative points you can't take food and drink in which is ridiculous. We left food in car and had to check out get it and eat in the picnic area but going back in. We bought one of the refillable drinks and shared it between us the queues at the kiosks were short but slow. Top tip if you go to the kiosks and ask for water they fill give you scup of iced water free. We needed that on our visit since it was over 100 degrees. Having to pay for lockers was also a pain otherwise on most rides you have to just leave you bags on a shelf which is very in safe. Again other parks deal with bags in a more sensible way with sliding doors over pigeon holes etc. Have to say that the merchandise in the shops was much cheaper than I expected or had seen at other parks. Watch out too for the things that look like an advertisement boards but are actually refreshment stations you press a button and a cool spray comes out. Given the temperatures we were expecting more fans and water sprays in the queues, there was only one, you get them in Florida why not here. But my biggest bug bear was the signage for the rides there are hardly any to help you navigate and there are many dead ends or few signs do you end up missing the rides you want. Another negative is the queue length times fortunately our queues were great but the sign were not accurate or all that helpful they should be electronic like other parks. Overall as I said magic parks but it has it faults but quality of coasters makes up for it.",Gary C
30,Older but still brings a smile to my face,The lines are ridiculous unless you want to chop of your right and left arm for their version of a fast-pass. The water fountains had hot water coing out of them!,Somewhere-LivinItUp

10,"Buckle up, there's a lot of things you should know.","My fiance and I went to this park for a 3 day vacation. We only ended up going to the park 1 day. Here is how that 1 day went:Right off the bat we go through these metal detectors and have our bagged checked. Fiance goes first and they stop him and tell him he isn't allowed to have his handcuff key (for those of you that don't know this is a small metal rod about as thick as a pencil and a couple inches long). He tries to explain that he has it because he volunteers a lot for the police department. They say they don't care, the lady takes it off his keychain and throws it in the trash.Annoyed, we go into the park and head straight for the virtual reality ride. At this time it is about 10:20 in the morning, the estimated time sign says 90 minutes which isn't bad. By noon we are still in this sun bleached line and I nearly pass out from the heat and lack of shade. I leave to go buy one of their refillable cups and get out of the sun to cool off. I was told I had to buy a cup from a small cafe that had a line out its door and a good ten feet out into the sun that was only being manned by two very overwhelmed people. Unable to wait I buy an overpriced bottle of water and head back. By 2 in the afternoon we finally make it on the ride and they give us the headsets for the ride, but my fiance's isn't working because it overheated. As it turns out the 90 wait was really a 4 hour wait because all of their equipment was overheating from overuse. They barely had enough to give one to each of the passengers each ride and because that put the VR in constant use out in the sun they were overheating every other ride. And if they don't have one to give to you they let you go again in the hopes that they'll have one then. We had to do this too and it didn't even work the second time around either. At that point we gave up and left the understaffed, under-resourced ride alone.It being 2:30 in the afternoon we go find an indoor restaurant to sit down in, The Full Throttle Bar. After a short 20 minute wait we were seated and discovered that the resturant was actually very large as it had a second story, but it wasn't being used because the restaurant didn't have the staff to cover that many tables. Instead they squished as many tables as they could on the first floor and had the customers deal with being elbow distance to their neighbor. The burgers and fries come out to us and the fries were noticeably old and had been on a hotplate for a long time to give them the appearance of ""fresh.""After food we headed over to Goliath, which was the highlight of our day. The line was only 1 and a half hours, and through most of it they had a mister system overhead to keep the guests and the bamboo cool. The only problem here is the ""most"" part. The rest of the line had the mister, but it was neglected and broken.From there we encountered five of the rides we wanted to go on being down. We finally find a ride that is working, Jet Stream, only to discover that this ride, like the rest of the park, was understaffed and no one was managing the line, leading to a lot of line cuts and wasted building space, thus making people wind out into the hot sun.At this point it is about 5 in the afternoon and a majority of the vendors that you refill your $20 cups at are out of ice, leaving you with lukewarm water or soda as your only options.We head over to Ninja, which had a really short wait of about 20 minutes, but was run by uncaring workers who didn't manage the line at all, creating a cluster, and would send out cars without anyone in them rather than deal with filling them properly. The family next to us had to keep letting people go ahead of them until they could all get on together because of this.The day ended with a round of go-karts (after paying an extra $16). My fiance and me pick two cars close together and had planned to have a bit of a race between us. I was out in the lead and he went to pass me right as a teenager slammed into him and sent him sideways into a wall before going and doing it to two other people. Despite the track's no ramming policy they watched the teenager proceed to ruin it for everyone. When we got off the track we went and complained to the cashier you pay to get on the ride and he responded with ""They probably didn't do anything because the only thing they could do would have been to kick everyone off the ride."" And I'm sorry, but if that is your only way of trying to enforce your rules then you need better management.The summary is that the park has a lot to offer, but because it was understaffed, neglected, under-resourced, and under-manged we will not be returning and I suggest to everyone to find a different park.",Ashley D
50,We went back for a 2nd visit- it is that EPIC,"We travel a lot- we will always try and get to the theme parks where ever we are. NOTHING comes close to Six Flags. It is EPIC. So many rides, and the variety in rides is amazing. We visited on the last day of the American school Holidays, and there were very few lines, only two rides had lines over 30mins long- and this is due to the fact that there are SO many rides. And 90% of the rides are outstanding. There are a huge variety of different rides to experience. We like our coasters, and this place hits hard with its rides.We did Six Flags on the first day of a 2 week tour of the west coast, we did all the other parks after this- Disney, Knox Berry, Universal, etc- We were soo disapointed that we did six flags first as all the rest were well behind Six Flags- it was so good we went back on the last day of our trip- we had 6 hours to fill before flying out, so we went back to do it all again- it was even better with less lines outside the school holidays.IF you go to LA you MUST go to Six Flags",Ben
30,Part of los angeles go card,We used our Los Angeles Go Card for the entrance of this crazy park. Nicest rollecoasters we have ever done!!But very commercial (no own food & drinks allowed). We took a re-fill cup. But had to wait sometimes up to 10minutes to finally get new drinks.Payment for lockers at Some attractions.Al lot of rollercoasters were out of service or went down when standing in the queue. So wasted a lot of time waiting.Tip: go as early as possible to avoid long queues.,Poosen
50,One of the best theme parks in the world!,"If passing anywhere near six flags magic mountain and you enjoy theme parks this is for you. I would not advise bringing young children or people who do not like rides as these rides are quite hardcore. I would also recomend getting a platinum pass, it is so worth the extra money as it allows you to skip all the queues except X2, for this reason I would also suggest doing this ride first. This theme park is fantastic with a large variety of rides.",pyol_master
40,Lots of rollercoasters,"There are lots of thrill rides here. We enjoyed our time here at the park. The lines weren't long and we were busy the entire day. The young people they have working at the park were very polite! Be prepared to pay quite a bit for food, but I guess that is to be expected in a theme park.",travelfam4045
50,DO IT - DONT MISS - FAST PASS WORTH EVERY PENNY,"On our 3 weeks Cali road trip - me and my 2 kids (age 10 and 14) visited1. Universal2. Disney3. Six Flags - Magic Mountain.The wildest rides and roller coaster was without a doubt Six Flags, the fast lane system was the best of all parks - we purchased fast past platinum and we had NO WAIT - the worst we had was 15-20min on 1 or 2 rides - other than that we just floated right through.We used the Valet parking - worked our fine, we had dinner upon arrival at the sports bar - good choice.The rides are just awesome - after a day in the park we were done - we had enough for a while.The VR rollercoaster was the only disappointment the rest was a blast - looking forward to visiting again and next time will be the water park.r park.",RasmusJN_Copenhagen
40,"Fun coasters, lots of hills","Went to Six Flags Magic Mountain because we are season pass holders for the park in Vallejo. This park has lots of thrilling coasters, but as usual most lines are long. The exception was for the water ride that had the round rafts. We got on that in about 8 minutes, but it was at 7pm so that's probably why. Our favorite thing in the park was the Kwerk show. The acrobats were amazing and we wished the show was longer. It was very original and entertaining. If you go to this park be aware that it is built on many hills and you will get tired. Some of the hills are very steep.",Teresa F
20,Final Farewell To Magic Mountain,"I usually visit California every summer and every summer I take my family to Six Flags Magic Mountain. Unfortunately 2016 will be the year I say a final farewell to this once favorite destination. For the last 3 summers each of my trips to Magic Mountain was a terrible, and expensive, disappointment. I may just be getting old but the 2 hour lines now seem incredibly long for a 45-60 second ride. In 2014 I went in mid August because the California schools were back in session. I avoided the long lines but unfortunately a large number of the rides were closed due to ""maintenance"". In 2015 I waited in line an hour for the newest ride before it went down indefinitely for unknown maintenance. And finally in 2016 I waited in line for the newest virtual reality ride for 2.5 hours, even getting into the roller coaster car before being pulled out because the ride went out of service indefinitely. My family drove 4 hours round trip, spent over 5 hours at the park, spent about $300 for tickets and food and managed to get on ""3"" rides. So I say farewell my fair Magic Mountain. I bare no ill will. We've simply outgrown each other. I hope you bring joy to many more families like you once did for mine.",Businessman151
40,Best Thrills in California,"Although it's not as famous or themed as Disney or Universal this park is definitely the best park in California. The lines are endless but like all major parks they do offer a fast-pass option. The rollercoasters are huge and they have a couple different types of rides mixed in. A lot of the rides are DC Superhero themed. There are also over 5 extreme rollercosters in the park that are just insane. Including Tatsu,Goliath and Twisted Colossus. The Drop of Doom was just huge. There is a lot to see so I would recommend spending a entire day here. Next door is the Hurricane Harbour Water Park but that is not included in the price and is a second park for a second day if you choose to go to both.",K3883LRtraveler
20,"Cool rides, but disasterous organsation!","July 18th 2016 we shoved up at the gates of Six Flags half an hour before opening at 10:30. We were not alone, but the crowd compared to ie Universal Studios was moderate. After beeing let in we rushed to the ""New Revolution"" ride suspecting the line to grow during the day. This decision almost ruined the day as we experienced the probably worst organized line ever. From the sign saying ""1 hour waiting time"" it took us alomost 3 hours to reach the front! The ride is based on the use of (Samsung) 3D goggles, but they incredibly enough didn't have enough goggles to fill up the carts! Resulting in 4-6 vaccant seats in each 20 seat (?) cart. The most provoking part was the staffs slow-motion cleaning of goggles in combination with their inability to fill up the carts with the waiting people who actually had receicved their goggles. The ride itself was mediocre and in our party of six, one of the goggles didn't work....After this horrendous start the experience improved significantly and especially the staff on Goliath deserves credit. This was one of the few atttractions wich seemed to be able to fill up all the carts and by this reducing the waiting line to a mInimum.The X2 experienced technical problems unfortunately and 50% of Superman was closed resulting in line you wouldn't believe. Out of the rides we tried though the following can be rcommended: Full Throttle for its originality, Goliath for the drop, Tatsu for the ""back-loop"" and Twisted Colossus for the sheer fun! And don't forget the Lex Luthor Drop of Doom with it's beautiful view...:-)Finally: There is an incredibly crummy app trying to inform visitors about the waiting time for each attraction. This is based on reporting from the visitors themselves and is not subjected to any quality assurance. Not supprisingly this results in wildly innaccurate figures. The most insulting side of the app is that you have to purchase the premium version to get a map of the park! These are however handed out for free (!) at the entrance.Ah, one more thing: we found an app called ""Coupons for Six Flags"" i Appstore. By typing COKE we saved $15 pr person for some reason...",Jan N
50,"This is a very clean, fun and diverse amusement park!","This is a very clean, fun and diverse amusement park!

20,Be Careful! Terrible Lost and Found Service!,Please be careful not to lose your belongings over there. The Lost and Found service is literally horrible and they don't want to offer any help. I lost my iphone and I know where it is exactly located inside the ride but they don't want to help or listen to you. They will ask you to fill an online request and then you won't be able to follow up with them. They kept me under pressure.,Faisal A
10,Lines were extremely long. We left park before noon.,The lines for the rides were as longs as 2 and 1/2 hours each. So coming in at 10 am and leaving at 9pm would have given us about about 5 rides. They do offer a fast pass for a fee. The cheapest one is $45 but it just allows you to hold a place in the current line. To actually skip the line it is $130 a person on top of the $80 entrance fee. For a family of 5 this is not likely. If you have a family I would skip this park during high vacation times. We ended up riding one ride and cutting our losses and leaving. I have a six flags season pass to the park near my home so I wasn't out that money.,Robert W
50,The most thrilling and amazing park,"If you are near Los Angeles, this place is must go! Come there at 10 am. First attraction to go is tatsu, and then all attraction on second floor, after you may go to first floor. So you'll not get huge lines, because all people go first to X2, there is huge lines. Your last attraction should be X2! X2 is the most amazing one, I assure you, this attraction has to be last in your list. If you don't want to spend money, take your lunch with you and leave it in car, when you are hungry just go to parking lot and eat; but, I don't offer you eat during you are getting on roller coasters. You may take water in bottles(I.e. Bottles that you take to fitness or school to drink tea, coffee or water). Water in the actual bottles is not allowed. Put sunscreen and take it with you. Wear comfortable clothes, such as sport shoes etc. you may wear so theme to protect your head from sun.",Aigerim B

40,You are in for a ride,"Even though it was a hot day, the sweating was not from the sun, but the adrenaline rush you getfrom all the roller coasters.With too many people seeking thrill, it is advisable to always go for express pass, else its not possible to enjoy all rides in single day.The only set back wad that too many rides had 'technical delays' on that day.A tip : avoid heavy foods on that day.",PushkinBansal
40,Best of the Six Flags parks.,"Huge day out that entertained us all. Monster rollercoasters and thrills all round.Only one or two rides out of action, which I have found is big news for Six Flags.Would be brilliant if they introduced a shuttle service to the nearest rail network as it is hard to get to if you don't drive, and one expensive taxi ride from almost anywhere in LA.There is a no smoking policy except in designated ares, but the pot smokers ignore that, and there are plenty of them around.The staff in the food and drink stalls are way too uninterested and the ice-cream stall ran out of ice-cream, and cones, but they didn't see this as a problem.Sort out the last three hassles and this would compete with Universal and Disney for jam-packed fun.",Steve W
40,The Twisted Colossus made the whole visit,Two families - first time at Six Flags. Average standard on service and food. The latest attraction - Revolution Virtual Reality Coaster - was terrible. Queing for hours and then googles did not work. Do not waste your time. The best ride is The Twisted Colossus and fairly short que.,Hans O
50,Best theme park ever for adrenaline lovers,Magic mountain is a coaster lovers paradise . You can't but help but love this place . Top ride for me had to be twisted colossus then superman a good 2nd . My only advice is get flash pass if your going in peak season we did and still took us a good day to ride most things .,Mark R
40,Coaster Lovers,If you love roller coasters this is your place. Just wish it had a little bigger section for the little ones that were with us and too little to ride the coasters. Only open till 9pm during the week in the summer is kind of a bummer when your on vacation.,D5274RNdavidp

50,Crazy Craziness but All Worth It,Stopped in to see some friends and took a venture to thrill ride land - Six Flags. Greats deals on tix can be found. Utilize the misters and shade when you can ... slop on the sunscreen too! Hit the far back first and make your way to the front. Save kiddie land if you have small kiddos for later in day when you are tired and need to chill. It will be cooler and they can roam with all that bottled up energy they possess.Eating ... utilize the refill cup. Shoot ... share with the fam! Waterfall it. Drinks are expensive! We had 13 people so we went and bought chicken buckets to share. Helped save some $. No food and drinks are allowed in.And really get in there when they open and make your ticket worth it ... stay till the end. And if you have motion sickness bring your oils or meds with you ...Have fun and make some memories!,LoveToTravel
40,Fun but pricy,Had a blast only negative was you couldn't walk around with beer 😑 I'm from Florida and all our parks allow it so it was just a different experience. Fast passes where cool but a bit on the pricy side though when ours malfunctioned they gave us a free ride.,Christina B
40,Great Time,I would recommend misters or fans while waiting in line during the summer. Love going here great family time!,Candice B
50,For thrill seekers,"This amusement park is not for the faint hearted the park consists of roller coasters catering for the young up too extreme thrill seekers, Superman the ride is awesome reaching speeds up too 100mph, spend the extra money and purchase a front of the line pass well worth it.",badhabbits05
50,Amazing Rollercoasters,"We are from St. Louis and spend several days each summer at Six Flags St. Louis. We compared the two parks. We were amazed by the number, size and variety of the coasters. The coasters seemed considerably longer and much larger as well. We were there from open to close and still had to choose which rides we would not be able to ride. Lines were between 30 mins and an hr each.We were also impressed with the number of rides that had cameras. One of our favorite things is buying the picture season pass and downloading every single one.I really liked that several of the rides actually adjusted to your height for the safety restraints.This park was so much cleaner and bigger than St. Louis. Seriously it make ours look like a kiddie park.If your kids meet the high requirements and love coasters this place is a can't miss. We spent our summer trip last summer at Cedar Point last summer. This park is just as highly recommended...",hutchens74
40,It really costs but it's big and our teenager loved it,"We went as a family so even though my wife and I did not take rides we had to pay a full adult admission ( that's a bit rich really) but we swallowed it because we wanted to be there with our eager teenager. The next big decision on top of full adult admission is the ""Flash Pass"" - this is a complex system whereby you pay a premium to reduce queuing. It's hard to judge if it's value, we took the basic pass but despite apparently large crowds pouring in hardly had any significant waits (max 20 mins) so seriously consider this. The facility is huge and v well run. Again no food and drink allowed to be bought in, but they readily allowed some special distort need items in. Food and drink inside is expensive but again they readily help with tap water refills of your drink bottle. Needless to say our teenager had an absolute ball and was exhausted and satisfied.",Tony S
20,Very poorly managed,"We've been to many different theme parks and I've never been to one with so many broke down rides. ""The new revolution"" , X2, scream, among others were not operating most of the day. Then you get in line at superman where they're only running half of it, then it breaks down but they don't bother to let anyone waiting in line know. Their lines run slower than most any parks with similar crowds. The rides are fun when they work but not worth the time considering the many better run parks there are. Fun day but we won't likely be back.",Chadfrisby
50,A must visit!,"I came here after going to Disneyland and Universal, which cost so much. It was great to go here, and only pay $35 a ticket. What a deal! We were there mid April, a perfect time to go. The rides were all awesome and crazy and scary! You want to make sure your kids are at least 8-10 years old, and even then there may be a few they can't go on. They do have a kids area with a few coasters. Overall great place, and will be back!",Cody M
10,Absurdly organized!,"This park has several great roller coasters. That´s great. But that´s where the fun stops. Entrance is 60-70 USD but you need a ""flash pass"" for minimum 50 USD to get reasonable lines. However, that´s not good for their 3D ride - the new revolution.So here´s our day; started with new revolution which broke down (for 3 hours), went to another roller coaster where we got stuck laying face down for 15 min, then tried the water ride which stopped for 2 hours. Finished off the day with 2 h wait for the (now running) new revolution. Out of us 4 - one fine, one had to go without 3D glasses, one saw a blurred film and for the 4th the film was stuck.An absurd vacation day - will not come back and can´t advice anyone to go there - unless perhaps if you have a season pass and will just stroll around.",687Mef
50,The kingdom of roller coasters,"In case you like roller coasters this is the place. SixFlags has all different typer of roller coasters, mostly really large and fast ones. There are just a few other types of attractions, therefor you should like roller coasters to fully enjoy the park. We spent a full day in the park, but did not manage to try all roller coasters. I got the impression that the park wasn't that busy the day for our visit, but every ride had about 30-45 min anyway. I assume it can queue up even more in really busy days. We enjoyed it very much, but then do we also like roller coasters! It's possible to buy a bottle of soda to be filled as much as you want all day for about $15. This was worth the money since it went really hot.",HakanHillborg
40,More Coasters than a Bar,"Loads of coasters so a great park for those who like rollers. Others highlights are the karts, which you pay extra for, and the 3 water rides. They should introduce wifi and an information app like other big theme parks.",Michael B
30,"Fun coasters, fairly shameful otherwise.","We bought normal tickets and the middle-level ""Flash Pass."" It turned out the lines were really short- we didn't need the Flash Pass but it was still nice to skip the waits.The coasters were fun but during our three or so hours at Magic Mountain three of the coasters we were waiting for went out-of-commission and then needed multiple test runs.The park was far from spotless and prices were wacko. I wanted a snack but a slice of pizza was $10.29. I felt a moral obligation to starve myself instead. 💪🏼We were really feeling fancy so we paid for valet parking. *Totally* worth it.The other park guests that we encountered- in line, next to them on rides, etc were very nice folks.",DougQ71
50,"Great park, but it was 112 when we visited","We took our 13 year old son here while on vacation in Southern California. The rides are pretty amazing. We were so excited to try the new 4-D ride New Revolution. We waited 2 hours in 112 degree heat and then my husbands goggles didn't work. The ride staff didn't care at all. It seems to me he should have been able to ride it again. The other park staff were very kind and offering water to guests. Buy the refillable souvenir bottle--it was totally worth it! We refilled ours about 13 times. Tacos at Food Etc were delicious. Twisted Colossus was our favorite ride of the day, but we also liked Superman. We liked the layout of the park. It was easy for first-timers to navigate.",Moonmel
30,Losing some of the magic...,"I'm devastated to be leaving anything less than a five star review for Six Flags. Visiting Magic Mountain has been a lifegoal of mine since I first hopped on board a rollercoaster as a kid. Maybe my hopes were set too high, but I was left very disappointed.PROS:- A lot of the rollercoasters are absolutely fantastic. Superman was my favourite, closely followed by X2, Tatsu, Riddlers Revenge and the Green Lantern.- I found the park quite easy to navigate using the signs and provided map, and though there was a lot of walking involved, the park wasn't as hard to get around as I'd initially imagined. Remember to wear comfortable shoes!- We ate at Katie's Kitchen and the food wasn't bad, big portions and tasty Mac n Cheese.CONS- Some very painful rides! Apocalypse especially was a total bone rattler!- My husband's VR headset didn't work during the New Revolution ride. He mentioned it to an employee and she just waved it off, telling him it would work once the ride started. It didn't; all he saw on the headset during the ride was a blank screen. He mentioned it to another employee on the way off the ride and the guy just returned the headset to the box, didn't even set it aside to check or fix it.- We purchased Platinum Flash Passes, which allow you to essentially skip to the front of the queues for a whopping $130 each. This price does not include park admission, and does NOT include X2. We added X2 to the pass for an extra $15 each. I think it's very greedy of the park not to have every ride available on the pass for such a high price. The pass was definitely a great investment as the queues were so huge, but the whole thing stank of money-making rather than customer satisfaction.- Speaking of prices, $4.50 for a bottle of water is absolutely disgusting. You are not allowed to bring your own food or bottled water into the park (your bags are checked as you arrive), so have little choice but to fork out extortionate amounts of money for simple human needs such as water.- It was a HOT day, and there is very little shade provided across the park and queues. All the places to eat are outside, so it's difficult to get out of the heat unless you go in a shop. It would be very easy to suffer from heat stroke here, and I was badly burned on my shoulders despite sun cream.- The staff, my last and biggest complaint. The guys working Tatsu and the Green Lantern were great, but a lot of the others were awful, just bored and unenthusiastic. They simply didn't care if you were having a good time or not. We arrived at the top of the Viper flash pass queue only to be completely ignored by the woman working there. She walked by us multiple times, not letting us on the ride or explaining anything. Eventually my husband got her attention and asked what we were supposed to do. She told us there was ""no flash pass queue at that moment so we could just go ahead and join one of the lines"". We would have had no problem with this if she'd told us immediately, but instead she left us and about 10 other people to roast in the sun and pointedly ignored us. There was very little banter or enthusiasm (again, not including the Tatsu guys, who were great), and we did not feel safe on some of the rides when the safety checks were so rushed.All in all, most of the rides were amazing and would be worth five stars alone, but the disregard for customer satisfaction really knocked my enjoyment of the park.",BlooCloud
40,Great vacation,Hadn't been there for nearly 20 years. Had children along and they had a great time. Despite being very HOT still managed to get to all of the rides. Twisted Collosus was great.,Owen L
50,Flash Pass,"If you want to enjoy the rides - buy the flash pass. We had the flash pass and could get on all the good rides without a hitch.Start your day early. We got there as soon as it opened and we were done by noon. We could redo all our rides, making the ticket worthwhile.Visited Jun 21, 2016",Tang2014
10,"Hours wait for rides, slow customer service, second visit.","I came here two years ago and had an unpleasant experience with the way the park was run. Despite this I really enjoyed the rides, and as I was visiting CA again this year I took some family with me this time.I don't know whether it's a cultural thing as where I'm from (UK) things seem to move 100 miles a minute, but the way this place is run is just so lethargically slow. It takes about an hour to actually gain entry, due to overcrowding and slow/inexperienced young staff. Most rides have queues of 1-2 hours due to what I perceive to be negligent overcrowding of the park that the park neither tries to regulate or forewarn people of before entering. They could cap visitors per day but can you ever see that happening due to the money they must rake in? Also, a massive problem with park management is that they are STILL turning away people from broken down rides that have queued the 1-2 hours without explanation or complimentary fast passes for a return ride. In my mind that is absolutely shameful. They need to look at parks in Europe that do that. The facilities of the park are overstretched and staffed by people too young to know what they're doing, yet they are kind as can be. The food is bland and overpriced, the refillable drink might seem like a bargain but throughout the day you will notice the drinks just taste like spring water with sugar mixed in, for the privilege of $16 a pop. No food or drink allowed in means they have you over hot coals for $15 lunches. Also parking at $20 is criminal. The way this place is run is jaw dropping and I won't come back here ever again.In the end after 5 hours we left having been on four rides. It just wasn't worth standing in blistering heat for. Staff operating rides do not know how to handle annoyed crowds when the coasters break down (this is not their fault, young staff are just a lot cheaper to employ), they just apologise and tell people to come back later or wait, no fast passes given whilst they hurriedly call an engineer out. The toilets are disgusting. The admission is expensive, in the UK places like Alton Towers and Thorpe Park charge $60 for two people.I'd just like to add, the admissions area is badly run, if you print tickets in advance there is no signage at the park to tell you where to go, so you queue. There is a faint tannoy about this but you can't hear it due to crowds. There's no signage outside the front. There's no info given beforehand. I waited in line with regular buyers for an hour only to be told I could have skipped the queue. The park is a shambles.",bex89
40,Go here for the roller coasters.,"We ordered platinum flash pass, due to we was here for the rollercoasters and wanted to test all of them.This Friday the temperature reached 118FWe started up with the VR- roller coaster.

40,Great! Fun for everyone!,"The park is great, be sure to be well rested, bring plenty of sun block and a change of clothes.

40,Fun park,"This was my first visit to this Six Flags. From the start we had some trouble with our season passes. It took a while to get it resolved, but eventually they corrected the problem, all computer syncing problems...The coasters at this park are amazing. We rode all day and still didn't get to them all. The longest we waited for any was maybe 45 min tops. Most were about 30 min. Not to bad.Food here is good, but beyond extremely expensive. $18 for a pulled park sandwich and 2 small sides. But that is what you get at amusement parks.My only complaint is the garbage. There was stuff thrown in every corner either due to a lack of garbage cans or overly full cans.",michelewelker
50,Awesome amusment park,"Came for the 4th july weekend party,Had so much fun here, long opening hours so you get to do everything. Get the fast passes to avoid the lines. Food is reasonable and rides are unbelievable. Definitely worth the visit",Darren L
40,Great but pricey food,"Six flags is a great theme park with so many amazing rides, the only issue is the crazy price of food & drink. This isn't too bad but when it's during a heat wave you resent the $4 for soda. We also found it originally a challenge getting to six flags without a car however we found you can catch a bus from North Hollywood to Santa Clarita and then the local bus the staff use to the park all for under $10!",yellow_obsession

30,Remember - come here for the rollercoaster rides...,"Brought my family here. We came here on a Tuesday on a super hot day (90's). (TIP: make sure to bring your sunblock and water bottles...) Suggest that you buy your cheaper tickets online. Though the $20 parking is kinda steep (they provide shuttle service going to and from the main entrance)... The lines for the rides were pretty much a breeze. Except for the new Revolution virtual ride - which was about an hour. Overall experience was ok - because of the rides and the quick lines; Service is a hit and miss - you will find very friendly and helpful staff (especially at the gift shop and cart) and lousy ones (like on some of the rides) - who don't care less if you were having fun or not and can be obnoxious on their comments ... we even saw a group of staff on the whistlestop ride...having their break standing up? chitchatting while we were riding the train (looks weird..). Service in the airconditioned food place was inconsistent too - the area were they sell fish and chips were great, while the one in the tacos area was meh... The food was not impressive - the fish sticks were huge (2 pcs per order) but it was too much breading - fish was not fresh... and it was oily too; the tacos were so so.. but then again you come here for the ride..period..Might comeback again someday - hopefully on a not so hot day...",tameia
30,First visit to six flags,"Visited six flags magic mountain on my recent trip to California- a hot day ( about 32 degrees ). I thought the rides were great! My favourites were X2- this was the craziest roller coaster I have ever been on- I would try to explain it but not knowing what to expect is best!I also found superman / twisted colossus/tatsu fun rides ( with tatsu having a crazy loop!)We were lucky with line times and longest we queued was about 45 minutes for the river Rapids! if I was basing this review on the rides alone I would give it 5 stars as It has the best collection of thrill rides/ coasters in a park I have been too however there some things I found disappointing.The cost of food in the park is extremely high. The cheapest piece of hot food starts at a minimum of $10 and this was for a stale cold piece of pizza that had been sat under a hot shelf for a while. With regards to drinks, a small bottle of water was $5. Considering this was a very hot sunny day it is a very costly dayout in order to stay healthy and hydrated. I would not be surprised if a number of people fell ill on their park visit simply due to dehydration and not having the money to rehydrate. In order to keep, for example a family of 4 hydrated, it would cost a minimum of $20 for one bottle each and then this would have to be repeated numerous times of the day in order to stay hydrated. The park is very clever in terms of making you buy their products as they do not allow you to bring in your own food and drink. However the park does encourage sun protection and hat protection on posters entering the park, which made me even more surprised with the price they were charging for a basic simple need such as water.In addition to sun protection, the park actually contradicts itself. Most of the queues for the rides the attendants made us queue outside in the sun, then allowed a set number of people through the shaded build up queuing area to enter the ride immediately. It would have been so much better if everyone could have queued inside of the build up area to remain cool.The park also tries to make more money out of their guests by charging a dollar for each locker per ride.Overall the park is a great experience for the rides alone but the park lets itself down with its hospitality.",Ian A

50,Intense,"This is the single most enjoyable day i had in LA by far. The best roller coaster park i have ever visited. To really enjoy the park you need the front of line passes though. They are expensive, but totally worth it. I would not think of going with regular tickets.",Havkri
40,Amazing Thrill Rides,"Went here with my 11 year old son who has an annual pass and I got in for free. We love Goliath and Tatsu rides...we went on them twice. I love that their waiting area for the lines are covered, for the most part. For example, on Full Throttle, there's a line forming in a covered canopy and then they will let some people on to wait on the 2nd stage so that no one is waiting out in the sun. The Goliath ride has bamboo plants that provides shade while in line and the Lex Luthor Drop of Doom has an air-conditioned building where you wait for the ride. All the shade helps especially in summer where it gets very hot. We were lucky that when we went there was a breeze to cool us off. The average wait time for rides was 45 minutes which is amazing for summer. Though the wait for Roaring Rapids was 1.5 hours. It's just not worth it. If you want to cool off I suggest going to the areas where they spray mist and stand there for 10 minutes. As usual food is super expensive. We ate at the Johnny Rockets in the park. Lunch for two was almost $60 but that includes a beverage bottle (pink) that is free refills for the day. The Twisted Colossus is another great ride here. The downside here is that every time it's almost our turn to ride there seems to be a mechanical issue so we have to wait longer. This happened in Full Throttle and Twisted Colossus. When we went to try Riddler's Revenge and Batman, both rides were closed due to mechanical issues. Batman opened up after an hour but it does not seem like Riddler's Revenge ever opened again. It's tradition for us to eat funnel cake before leaving the park. It really is very good but again very expensive. I love the rides in this park. I just wish the lines were not so long. Even the line to get in is crazy. I almost want to get a Discover card just so I can skip the line to enter the park.",qhunnyb
10,Unacceptable Wait,"Absolutely the worst lines to get in either the waterpark or amusement park. It is usually pushing 100 degrees during the summer in Valencia and without adequate shade waiting to get in is DREADFUL....over an hour each time. I definitely don't recommend bringing small children... Much too hot.Management could care less. It's not about making the consumer happy, it's about making Six Flags wealthier.",MImiampa
10,Shaneful,"Not much to say good about this place. Tied, dirty and disengaged employees The entire experience is about ripping off the customer. $4.50 bottles of water, really????Anyway go at you're peril. Not what it used to be and is sadly a money grubbing dump with many rides out of service, trash and signs of deferred maintenance everywhere.From the look of some of the reviews on the place it's clear that management doesn't offer a better product/experience because they know they don't have to. Dope like me do it for the kids who look past the many flaws.",Eugene E
50,Great Times with Friends,"This is a great park with lots of rides, attractions and shows for all ages. Came here with a group of friends (all late 20s-early 30s). We purchased VIP tickets to get front of the line access, which was a huge plus. I love extreme roller coasters and this place didn't disappoint. They also seem to maintain their rides better than other attractions, which is helpful with avoiding headaches and a sore back.Food and drink options are good. Park was clean and felt very safe. We stayed at the local Embassy suites, which wasn't far and has a daily full-breakfast. Our group looks forward to visiting again!",DLGabriel19
10,Security Checks Slow and Not sure what They are doing.,"Went to the amusement park on a weekend. It was a hot day, during the security check we were not aloud any snacks, small candy or even bottled water to go thru the park, the security said go back and put it back in our car or put it in their collection box, where I think the end of the day they take it themselves. My car was far away, I do not want to go back in the end of the line. My family just surrendered what we have. What is also not proper was they check my wallet and my Wife's purse..The park seems to hire none educated or no common sense adults. We did not have fun after that experience, only stayed for 1 1/2 hr. which was also a waist.",Fil A
50,Annual Family Summer Destination,"I have 4 boys (6, 8, 9, and 11). We go to Six Flags Magic Mountain every summer for one of their birthdays. The kids' area is fantastic. They have added so much to that area to really cater to the younger crowd. The small scale roller coasters are great and my kids have a great time all day!",Lauren S
40,Fun amusement park,"We love six flags, however, Magic Mountain is now an amusement park for real thrill seekers more than for a family. Rides for those who don't ride roller coasters were limited and or closed. Our granddaughter is too old for Bugs Bunny land and too young for Goliath - not much else. Food way to expensive. And everything now is a sales push for a seasonal pass - dining, shopping, drinks. $25.00 for unlimited drinks is too pricey but we purchased anyway.",LaVerne C
40,Fun day out,Six flags was a lot if fun. It was unfortunate the day we went a lot of the main attractions had problems and weren't running part of the day and some the entire day. Wait times were reasonable and would go back to try the ones we missed out on.,Phillipa_Fuller
10,The worst,"We are park people, we love coasters. This was the worst experience ever. We got there at opening on a Weekday and waited two hours for one ride, it closed before we rode. Then waited an hour for another and finally had one ride in by 1pm. Decided since we had driven 26 hours and would never be back to get the flash pass for the kids. Waited another 1.5 hours to get those and spent a RIDICULOUS amount of money for two platinum passes. So two teenagers sprinted around the park starting at 3pm for what was left of the day and managed to ride all but one of the operating coasters with the overpriced line skipping system. Such a shame that it is so poorly managed. It has good rides but they are not maintained well and it's absurd that your daily admission is useless if you're there to actually ride something. You will grow old and die waiting in the regular lines. Never again. In fact I'm DONE with all Six Flags franchises after this experience. They will never see another dime from me.",kjhaze
50,So. Many. Rollercoasters.,"If you are a fan of rollercoasters this is the place for you. If you are going for teacups or family rides this probably isn't the place. It is simply full of huge, rollercoasters. Queues are what you'd expect - quite long but not ridiculous. Would be hard to ride everything a in one visit.",harrymonaghan

50,Scream like a child,"Magic Mountain is a perfect place for a person who want to rush his adrenalin. If you decide to visit this place I can give you some tips:1. If there is chance try to go on weekdays; otherwise, you will wait in a line about an hour.2. Do not take food with you, they won't let you take food inside of the park.3. Wear clothes with zippers (so you won't lose your belongings), and don't take any backpacks (you will be looking for lockers all the time and they are not free sometimes)4. Don't start with X2. It is the scariest attraction, others after X2 won't be so good.5. If you buy a season pass you friend can buy his ticket for a cheaper price (you should look at their website for more information)6. If you have enough money I suggest you to buy front line ticket (I regret that I did not buy it, as sometimes lines are too big and you just lose your time)Hopefully, you will enjoy your time there =))",Asselya S
20,Not worth it,Dearty and long lines. The rides are not as thrilling as expected. Europe can def compete!! The flash pass is not for all rides and many one can only go once. Over all a ok day,KSwissCH
30,Do not compare lemons an apples...,"This park it is mainly for teens I would say. You have to be a thrill seeker. My daughter (13) has been asking me forever to go to Six Flags (we live in Miami so we visited Orlando parks a million times) so we decided to take her there while on vacation in California. After checking their videos on the website I was sure this park was not for me because I get dizzy easily and I get afraid even before I get into the rides...but what don't we do for our kid's happiness? She checked the rides online also but she said she would do ""some"". Well...we ALL did most of them. I read about the ""fast pass"" or something like that, which would help us skip some lines or shorter the waiting time but it really adds up to the entrance price so we decided to not pay for it. The good thing was that it was Summer vacation but a Friday, then we didn't have too much wait on the rides. Most of the wait was due to the disorganization of the employees. I don't know if that is the trend of the park (go to whatever line you want - if you want - which left many sits empty all the time making the wait times longer) freedom to chose but more wait, or maybe the employees literally didn't care. In some rides there were 8 young attendants chatting while two others were doing all the work...felt annoyed most of the time. The rides are mostly REALLY good but the employees need more training, control, overseeing...some of them were very young...and seem really careless. The food is OVERPRICED and since you can't bring nothing from the outside...have a very good breakfast before you come in, please. The all-you-can drink cup ($15.99) is totally worthy since every soda costs almost $5. We all drank from the same one and we save a lot of $$. We didn't do all the rides, as I said, some of them made us really sick just watching them from afar...but it was a nice change to Disney parks and Universal...rides only...lot of walk, lot of sun, heat...",IngridHA1973
10,Wait in line or drop $1k,"Arrive 1 hour after park opens $20 to park, 15 minute walk to the entrance, 1 hour wait through the security line with no shade, 1 hour wait to get tickets from will call, 45 minute wait for the first not packed ride. But wait, for just about $400 more you can go to the front of the line! That brings the total cost of one day admission to just shy of $1000 for a family of four not including meals. (No outside food or drink allowed)I get that this is an amusement park and crowds are to be expected but during a week day just after opening this seems excessive. In retrospect I wish my family had chosen literally any other activity.",Travis H
50,First Time and it is Nice,"Our first time as a family visiting the park. We purchased season passes because they are cheaper than ONE DAY at Disney or Universal Studios. We also did the parking pass for $65 versus $20 each time you enter the park. Does not matter where you park because there is a shuttle that takes you to the gate. Park is nice with lots of shade trees. You can also take a ride to the top of the hill instead of walking if you like. Plenty to do with a wide range of rides, games and food options. The water park is also connected for easy access. Lines were short and we got on all the rides we wanted to. Will return to check out the rest of the park. It is big so you will get some exercise.",Jeff M

40,Super Fun but hot day,So the day was 112 degrees so we kept the daytime short. The upshot was when we came back at night there were no lines. Staff were about as helpful as other reviewers suggested. Definitely the place to go for the most thrilling roller coasters. Never got to ride Twisted Colossus or the Ninja. My favorite rides were Goliath and Tatsu.,Jon Y
50,The World's Best!,"Visited July 2014, had an amazing time.In terms of crowds, I can't really comment as there was an incident involving the 'Ninja' coaster that was reported on the news the day before we went (perhaps that affected attendance on the day we visited?) However, coaster lines are not that long, considering there's so much choice!This park really does have so many types of coasters, it can only be described as a thrill seeker's heaven, X2 is a really unique coaster and there is several coasters with various different elements, big drops, loops, launches etc.We ate at a restaurant near Goliath, which provided good service and pricing, and decent food, and it's definitely worth buying the refillable drinks cup, being in the desert, it can get VERY hot!",Matt W
40,Great coaster park,We drove down from the Sacramento area to ride the coasters. We all had a blast. The coasters were some of the best I've been on.,David H
50,Roller coaster heaven!,"If you are a roller coaster junkie, then Six Flags is the theme park for you. So many really good coasters in one spot, it's insane.The price is right as well. I would so much rather go here for half the cost of DisneyLand. Obviously, this is not the Magic Kingdom, but you also don't have to take out a loan to have a nice visit.The food is typical theme park food. It could be better, but it's not bad. Still expensive though.It can be very hot during the summer. I remember plenty of sun burns from standing in line all day during 100* days in Santa Clarita. The park does a good job providing shade and misters for those waiting in lineWhich also brings up this issue. I believe it's best to visit during the late afternoon and extend into the evening. That way when the sun goes down and people start to leave (shorts lines) your not all burnt out (pun intended) from a day of standing around in long lines. Plus, it's not as hot.Hit the water rides while it's still hot and there is enough time to dry off.",Joe G
50,Traveling Texans,"Living in Texas all our lives, we have grown up with several amusement parks. We purchased season passes this year with plans for a family vacation to visit a new park. We are all roller coaster fans and Magic Mountain was attractive because of it's 18 thrill rides. We were not disappointed. Although it was a bit warm on the June days that we visited, we were able to survive the heat and the hills and enjoy all the rides we had read about. We enjoyed many of the rides (dispite some long lines). A couple of warnings...The Viper is very rough, we spent most of the ride clinching our jaws and just waiting for it to stop, I would not ride it again and the misery was the same for our 21 and 18 year olds. The Superman is great, but climbing the hill is CRAZY! There is a blue ride (Honda something) that will take you up the hill. You will enjoy the Superman much more if you aren't out of breath before you get there. We finally made it to the back of the park at the end of our 2nd day and only wish we had discovered the Apocalypse earlier. It too is a little rough (as it should be for a wood coaster), but the speed, turns and thrills made this one of our favorites! There are no short cuts through the line, so even if it's not a long line, you still have to weave through all the bars. There are some small, dark tunnels as part of the line and it was very, very warm inside as they didn't have the a/c turned on. Tatsu didn't seem to be inviting and a little unnerving flying face down on the ride, but what a surprise! A must try! Also a long, slow line, but glad we did it. Maybe worth an hour, but we passed when the line appeared to be a good 2 hour wait. Almost all of the rides have boxes or cubbies on the loading dock for you to store your items while riding but do not put them on the ground if there is a box (you will be asked to move it and this holds up the ride). As I mentioned, it was very warm while we were there and although the concession stands would give free ice water, I think there could have been more individual drink stands open. Most of the good lines were pretty long when all you need is a drink. I saw several people with their own bottled water, so check the policy regarding outside food/drink. It is a very big park, with lots of hills so tennis shoes are a great idea. Enjoy the beautiful scenery of the lush trees and bright flowers planted around the park.",Momotwin
10,Time and money waisting!!!,Only lines and no fun. We buy in counter regular one day tickets. We have been there 5 hours and in that time we can ride only 2 rides. You just waiting and waiting....pointless!,Priit L
20,Extremely inefficient and slow entry,"We have season passes and arrived before opening. Once you are thru the inefficient security scan, you are thrust into a mob of people waiting to scan your season pass card. We've been in this mob for nearly 25 mins and have at least 15 to 20 mins to go. Rides are good here, but the entry process is ridiculous.",TomDDP
50,Transcendence Experience with Roller Coaster,"If you are a roller coaster person, this is definitely must-go place. I loved almost every roller coaster they have, but my favorite one was absolutely the Tatsu. That wasn't scared at all, but during riding, I felt that I was flying like a dragon. I guess that's why they drew a dragon at the Tatsu title board. I highly recommend Tatsu!",Julie
40,"If you love thrill rides, this is the place!","Magic Mountain is the place to visit if you enjoy high thrill rides and are not intimidated by the most daring of coasters. Visiting Magic Mountain is definitely worth the price of admission if you like soaring high and fast and you don't mind orbiting around completely numerous times during the ride. This is what the rides at Magic Mountain do best. There are lots of more tame rides for those with weak stomachs, but for those who appreciate the big thrills, you will have plenty of opportunities to have a good time here. There is also a great area for the littler guests to explore with rides well-suited for their needs and a fun ball house where they can shoot foam balls at one another from across the room. Magic Mountain offers fun rides for each member of the family and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a great way to spend the day!",Susan W

50,Best Roller Coasters,"We have been to Magic Mountain a few times but this time the youngest was eight and was able to enjoy the whole park. If you are going for more than one day get the season pass. We bought our season passes last year when there was a special so our passes included entry to Hurricane Harbour. Since we were going to be there for the week we also bought the gold dining passes. These passes give you the refillable drink bottle so you don't pay for drinks at all. It also gave you lunch, dinner and a snack everyday. Make sure you get a list of the restaurants that accept the pass from guest relations. These passes are great value for money. The park itself is great. We were able to get in all rides without too much trouble. The newer rides like full throttle and tastu have a line but that's to be expected. One of the bonuses with your season pass is that you can access the park 15 minutes before it opens to the public. If you go straight to a ride like full throttle you should get on nearly straight away. Just remember to allow yourself time to get through security. That can take up to thirty minutes on a busy day.",Loz212
40,Kids had a great time but set your bar medium for expectations,"Great coasters. That's what you really go for and getting in early is key for that.The kiddie part was still fun for my 8yo daughter who is not a thrill seeker, but they were lackadaisical about opening that area and she lost a good 1/2 hour + of fun waiting around.Pretty good food options not super but varied enough.We have an annual pass so didn't go crazy waiting in lines and that really makes those kind of parks a lot more fun.",Andoverminnie
20,Meh,"The rides are AWESOME!! My problem is the price of admission, food and beverages. If you don't buy a flash pass don't even bother going!! We bought the premium pass, at $130 per person it's a big price tag but we got on every ride. All together for two people to get in, park and purchase the fast pass we spent just under $500(not including food or drinks). The grounds are not updated or well maintained. Staff is for the most part is very unfriendly and not informed on anything in the park.",Jared C
40,Kids had a blast!,"Ok so we have the season pass, I mean why not it's almost the same as one day pass!! The rides are super awesome and the kids and my husband enjoyed every minute lol the reason why it's not a 5 star for me in particular is because the rides are not built fluffy friendly. So I was not able to enjoy all that they did. Not my sister who is a size 10-12 said most of the rides were very snug for her. Just so the travelers know. Not saying it should be catered for fluffy friendly just saying it was a bummer. For lunch we had a chicken ranch wrap next to the apocalypse ride. It was surprisingly really good! I saw bad reviews on the food and nobody in my party had anything bad to say about the places we stopped to eat. The Goliath and Drop of Doom is a must!!!",TravelTasteReviewsCo

30,"Good rollers, but one very annoying facilliy","The roller coaster there are great!One thing that was VERY annoying and stupid is that there is a facility that completely makes you wet - it's a roller coaster park, people don't usually bring change of clothes, and let's see you riding in a roller coaster with wet clothes.. At the exit of the facility there's a store with a lot of clothes and flip flops - a cheap move to make money.But besides that it's an amazing roller coaster experience.",avishay696

50,Roller Coaster theme Park of Dreams!!!,"Growing up as a child being exposed to cartoons such as the 80's version of Dungeons and Dragons I had always dreamt of attending one of those thrilling roller coaster theme Parks. To my surprise Six Flags Magic Mountain made the dream a reality and I'm not exaggerating but to some extent has filled that void in me.People visiting California must make this park an Item on their agenda, there is just so much thrills to be had that it would be a darn shame for enthusiasts to miss out on this spectacular collection of rides.Now upon entering you have the option of spending more ""money"" on a ""Flash Pass"" let me tell you that in our experience on a weekday the lines aren't that congested, however due to the large number of Roller Coasters in this park, we found that a flash pass was beneficial not only reducing wait times but it helped us in organizing and tackling the number of rides, in total for the day we managed to get on 12 roller coastersAs for the coasters on the day we attended the infamous X2 coaster was down (sucks) however, we manged to get on almost everything else,in my opinion there are no bad rides, every ride is unique and must be experienced on a stand alone basis. However, for the sake of selecting winners the top 3 were Tatsu, Twisted Colossus and Full Throttle, but the rest were all fun in their own right.I've given the park 5 stars but that doesn't mean there isnt room for improvement, several areas in the park need their theming improved especially upon first entering spending some money in fine tuning and maintenance will go a long way in making the park more enjoyable.Green Lantern the ride physically hurt me and left me with bruises on my chest please see how this can be improved upon and or reduced.Apocalypse's theming reminded me alot of the new Mad MAX movie it wouldn't take much to remodel the ride to resemble the mad max film.food in the park was awful and vastly overpriced so avoid like the plague or just snack and save up for after you're done with the park.In terms of merchandise they had a good variety of WB themed characters and properties and the quality was pretty good on par if not better than Disney.overall with flash pass this park can be done in a day, however, to experience all the rides at a leisurely pace two days on a whole is more than enough. In closing whatever Six Flags Magic Mountain lacks in design and detail it more than makes up with the sheer number of attractions and coasters that no Disney and universal can compete with, so two thumbs up and a must for any California Holiday.",TheWanderrr
50,Not for the faint of heart!,"I used to go to Magic Mountain at least twice a year when I was a kid, and would run from one end of the park to the other with reckless abandon, but now that I am older, I was easily worn out by this massive park. For anyone who is a thrill seeker, this park is a must to visit! My favorites include Riddlers Revenge and X2! I took my wife this last visit, as she had never been there, and we were both exhausted after just riding 4 rides. The park is beautiful, but very hilly, so be sure to wear comfortable walking shoes. Also be sure to bring an extra pair of socks if you plan on going on any water rides. There is no fun in having wet socks walking as much as you do!",Douglas K
40,Amazing Extreme rides!,"Fun day! At memorial day. Damn line was long but still worth it since me and my friend has two jobs and can't have any off other than holidays. We got out tickets 5 day advance purchase so instead of around $70, it's $55. But then, later on we learned that we can get even more discount because of workingadvantage.com.

My feet and my friend See are tired. Not only from walking but from waiting standing for 4-5 hours or more due to line.X2. Craziest roller coaster I've been in ever. That's from someone that started riding big ones at 2nd grade. Not only the normal huge turns but also your seats will rotate as well.Tatsu. Fun ride. A little extreme too but it has a different effect while riding it. Different style rotation I guess.Scream. Short line. Good adventure, if you see that the line is short, go and ride it. Worth it.Sand Blasters. We thought we can't ride anymore due to closing time but the short was hella short so why not.Apocalypse. Last ride. DON'T UNDERESTIMATE. This is the coolest.All wood ride. Design of the place looks like no effort just old cars since duh it's apocalypse but when you get inside it was cool to see lights and computers so they did think of stuff, lol. Parts where you pass inside is my favorite part but it jiggles.Corn Dog and Pastrami Fries. Never expect anything from these public places regarding delicious food.

10,Lack of management,"We went to the park on June 3rd, the pack was crowded lines (2 hours) everywhere. I understand the number of teenagers due to the end of the school year, but the management could have prepared in advance, FEW WORKERS at point of sales made our day a nightmare, long lines and usually one person attending everybody, poor workers. We were frustrated and decided to buy the FLASH PASS, I felt like I was being stolen $75,00 each person and guess what, the most crowded rides were not included, and we should pay extra $15,00 for each ride. I couldnt believe that. Do not recommend, we have been many times to Disney and Universal, first time here, WILL NEVER COME BACK AGAIN.",Felipe D
40,Brilliant rides!,"We had just one day to visit Six Flags and luckily it was a quiet weekday. If your into big rollercoasters then this park is a must for you. Twisted colossus is awesome and most of the rides were good although one or two were a bit painful (Green Lantern comes to mind)The food wasn't great, slow service and very expensive. Even Disney was cheaper for drinks and snacks. Overall a brilliant day at Six Flags and would definitely recommend.",rich210uk
40,Wild an awesome day with the family!,Last week I visited magic mountain with my brother and cousins! We had an extremely wild an exciting day! We did many different rides because the lines where really short and that was perfect! But still there are to many rides to do in one day! Cool park and really clean!,Jessica V

50,Season Pass Holder,"we have a season pass and it has paid for itself! it's great that we can go any time, any days! there are rides for all the kids as young as 2yrs old to adults. we also have the dinning pass and its a great value! there are plenty of food to choose from, healthy to tasty sweets! this is a great place to spend family day!",mziel16
50,We are ACE Coaster club members and we love this park!,"We belong to the American Coaster Enthsiasts coaster club and visit parks around the country and if you are a thrill ride seeker this is the park for you! It is one of the premier paris around the world for its thrill rides and for good reason because there are rides to suit everyone's preferred styles. We love so many of them we can't even list them all but we recommend you buy the flash pass to get the most out of your day. You should also try to stay close to the park so that returns to your hotel can happen easier as a full day and night at this park can be exhausting. Other tips are go early and look at a map to decide which rides to hit first before the crowd builds up. If you aren't an experienced rider consider ""building up"" to the top thrill rides. There are also tricks to riding so it's less physically taxing so pay attention to the ride. Sometimes you want to let your body flow with the ride and other times you want to be bracing yourself. Happy riding!",qoe505
40,Adrenalize yourself.,"Just visited in the first week of may, and the first thing i need to put up is unlike a lot of reviews read on tripadvisor, it is a well set up park with good roller costers .although the food is a tad pricey but the thril at all the rides is exhilirating. It was a weekday and the wait line was negligible.If you are looking to raise your hair, than this is the place, unlike the familly retreat at Universal.just plan your rides well, as it is a bit of a steep climb to go up to the mountain again and again.",jbaths
50,A roller coaster park,"If you ask me, this is the best theme park in the world. I have been here multiple times before, and I never get bored. The good things about hhis place are: the cheap enterance, the continuous newly presented rides ( like the revolution now), the great rides and the competent staff. However, deapite it being very cheap ($80) but the flash pass is useless on a busy day unless you buy the platinum which is like $130 per person!",Ahmed J
50,It's all about the roller coasters,"On our spring break trip to Los Angeles, we skipped Disney and Universal, but fed our need for speed with a full day at Six Flags Magic Mountain. We left early enough to drive the hour or so north to Six Flags Magic Mountain, and got there a half hour ahead of opening, leaving shortly before close—and in between we exhausted ourselves riding nearly every attraction in the park, some more than once. Family favorites included Goliath, Riddler’s Revenge, and Scream. My daughter and I loved Tatsu, but my wife did not like having to hang face-down in her seat at the end of the ride waiting to be unloaded.SFMM is a true coaster enthusiast’s park, with lip service given to young families and themed attractions which are executed much better at other local amusement parks. But if you want speed and thrills, it can’t be beat. The park is all about the rides, and sometimes other aspects of the experience—such as cleanliness and an immersive experience—are ignored. From the top of many of the taller rides—especially in the back half of the park—you can see backstage buildings, plenty of trash, and other elements that Disney takes great pains to avoid guests seeing.",dunadan
40,Amazing Roller Coasters,"We absolutely loved all the rides at Six Flags Magic Mountain! For a family that loves riding big rides this is the place for you! The park is not as clean as it could be and the food prices are outrageous, but it's not any worse than your average amusement park. We would definitely go here again!",ellrand
30,"Save money, buy gold!","We visited May 25-27. We did 1/2 day Wed then all day Thurs and Fri. As far as wait times for rides it was amazeballs. No one was there! The max we waited was 30 min and that was mid-day for the BIG rides X2, Tatsu etc. Friday was busier...but we expected that as it was the first day of Summer for Cali kids.We bought the GOLD season pass, the parking pass AND the GOLD food pass. For a family of 4 it was,about $800 total. Sounds like a lot but parking is $20 a pop, entry is $80 per day, each meal would have been $15 each eeeeasy, drink cups would be $15 each and snacks are $5-15. With the gold food pass we paid $80 each person and got a free refillable cup (w/free refills all season), free lunch(11:30-3:30), free snack (anytime) and free dinner (4- close) ALL SEASON!! It paid for itself on the first day! The food options are awesome and the food is fantastic! Our favorites were Chopsix (Chinese) and Twisted Wiches (sandwich shop in the steampunk district)Service is painfully slow. There is NO sense of urgency from any food service people. Not once did I see someone hustle for ANY reason. They're all friendly though! Watch restaraunts closing times-some close earlier than others.With the gold pass you get into the park 10 min before everyone else so make sure you're in the right entry line (all the way to the right-it's gated off just for us)There were not a lot of characters to take photos with and there were NO shows playing until the ""official"" Memorial Day weekend (starting Friday night-so we just missed it.Wear the right shoes and pack moleskin cuz this park is HUGE and hilly! 290 acres vs Disney's 85.We had an awesome time. We will totally be using the max benefit of our gold season pass.",onetallmom
50,"Thrills, New and Improved!","Myself and my DH and 2 DDs had a great time at Magic Mountain. We went mid week in May to reduce ride wait times. If you love roller coasters than there is no better place!The newly renovated Twisted Colossus is AMAZING. Even though we went mid week we couldn't ride all the coasters so we are going back in June. (Memorial Day special...buy a day get the rest of the year)Regarding food, leave it in the car. They will turn you away at the security checkpoint.",carimekarma
50,Great roller coasters,"I just went to Magic Mountain a few weeks ago, after not having been there for about 10 years. The new rides are great - especially X2 - it's easily the best ride in the park! Tatsu was probably my second favorite ride. Other not-to-be-missed rides: Full Throttle, Goliath, Colossus.My friend and I splurged on THE FLASH Pass Platinum (which was really expensive, but worth it, since I will probably not go back to Magic Mountain for another 10 years). With THE FLASH Pass Platinum, we never had to wait more than 5 minutes for any coaster, and we were able to hit all the major rides in about 7 hours, including breaks to eat lunch, digest and let our brains calm down. I highly recommend THE FLASH Pass if you don't like waiting in long lines.Apocalypse is horrible - it's almost as bad as the original wooden Psyclone - it is so jarring that you will think you have shaken-baby syndrome.Food is very expensive and not very good. They sell refillable plastic bottles for soda (about $14.99 for the day - each refill is $1; whereas a single soda is about $4.95).Parking is $20, so if you're coming in a group, be sure to carpool.The front entry gates have really long lines - apparently, season pass holders have to scan their fingerprints, and the scanners don't work every time, so it creates quite a backup.",VinceInLA
30,Excellent roller coasters with unfriendly pricing,"Magic Mountain has been there for years. It is home of some of the best roller coasters in the United States. It is unfortunate that the price you pay at the gate does not include all of the attractions. If you want to ride the go carts or climb a rock wall, that will be extra. There are many other similar smaller attractions that are like that. In addition, the food prices are absolutely astronomical. It also cost you $20 to park. All in all if you love roller coasters, it's a great place if you can withstand the cost. If you don't like roller coasters, don't bother at all",tritipisgood
40,Good for ride enthusiasts!,"If you love roller coasters and thrilling rides then this is the place! X2 is one of the best roller coasters I have ever been on! Many other high thrill rides like Superman, Drop of Doom, and many others. Fast Pass good on crowded day. It is not really great for those who do not love thrill/scare rides, as they have very few activities other than eating for this kind of guest. Corn on cob pretty tasty and their funnel cakes are yummy too! BBQ best bet food wise! Our 100+ Teens loved it! We got picnic package with ticket which was good deal but food just okay (hot dogs, chicken fingers, corn, baked beans, rolls and salad. Had ice cream also, overall not great for strict eaters. Picnic area okay but a bit boring with covered area and plastic tables, had yard area but not made for eating just playing and kinda hidden from eating area. Tidal Wave was closed while we were there but other water rides open. They are very nice and accomodating to groups - suggest getting there 45 min. Before it opens so you can get through security and run to ride you want first.",Yvonne A
30,Birthday fun,"Lines getting into the park were poorly managed, everyone passes through metal detectors but unlike every other amusement park in the US, they don't separate those with and without bags to expedite entry. Once inside the park is a lot of fun, tons of roller coasters and most lines are well managed. Food is pricey as expected, but the quantity and quality needs improvement for the price point. A nice change from Disney, need some additional in park transportation due to lots of steep hills. Not recommended for wheelchair guests or those with challenges walking long distances and up and down steep grades.",Stephen H
50,The most roller coaster i have ever taken!!,It was the best experience for roller coaster rides. The thrill was endless!! there was at least 20 different roller coaster rides.,HongGongGong
30,"Amazing rides, unfriendly staff and ambience","First of all - we loved the rides. Best thrill rides on our whole vacation in the States (we were there for 6 weeks which included 11 different theme parks). However, the park was lacking! The theming was terrible and the place just looks extremely run down. The lay out is horrible and needs a make over!!!!!We purchased the Platinum Flash pass which was ridiculously expensive however as we were there at a peak time only for 1 day, we thought we might as well. We only needed to use it on a few occassions (in particular for Twisted Colossus which it would only allow you to use it once). We also paid extra for X2 which stopped working half way through the day before we had used our Flash Pass for it so we had to fuss around getting a refund.Another thing that bothered us was how disorganised the lines were. We had purchased the flash pass but spent a lot of time working out how to get onto the ride (it just seemed that the Flash pass line was an after-thought and had us walking up exit lines and back stairs to figure out where to go!). Another frustrating aspect was that even though the flash pass got us past a lot of people in the line, we still had to wait a LONG time once we were scanned on. We could not figure out how the flash pass actually cut out 90% of the wait time!!And finally, we were disappointed that the ban of the use of go-pros/cameras on rides was not properly advertised. We had a go-pro attached to our wrist once we were strapped into a ride (after not seeing any signs to say it wasn't allowed). We ended up having one staff member rudely telling us it wasn't allowed and that we had to leave it on the side of the ride whilst we rode it (it's an expensive camera- we weren't just going to leave it!). When we told her we wouldn't just leave it on the side of the ride, another more pleasant staff member came up and said that it was ok if we didn't use it and put it in a locker straight after we rode (which we were happy to do - we had just put all our other belongings in a locker). These two staff members proceeded to disagree about what should be done, all whilst the entire line looked at us. We didn't care that we couldn't use our camera- it would have just been nice to know in advance and that the two staff members didn't need to have caused a scene. We got off the ride before it began, put our go-pro in the locker and went back on the ride.After all of this, we asked the staff member where it said we couldn't use the camera and she didn't have an answer for us!!It did say in small print on the map which we saw afterwards, however as we had just came from Disney where their ban on items such as selfie sticks was plastered all over the place, we expected more from Six Flags and would have happily not brought along our gopro.",Cvg11
40,Good Family Fun,"We have been to Six Flags many times over the years. It is a nice park with good weather pretty much year round. The rides are very thrilling. I have noticed the park is starting to look a bit run down on our last trip. Paint is faded, wood is splintered and old, metal is rusted, and some sections of the park are closed off from decommissioned rides. Not that anything looks unsafe it just needs some TLC to freshen things up.",DesertProwler
30,Great rides shame about the reliability and queues,"Visited this attraction on Saturday 21 st May.Stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn and got a shuttle up and walked back, saving $ parking.This theme park has some truly awesome rides however don't expect to do too many without buying an additional fast pass as queues are long and ride reliability poor.X2 is truly amazing and it needs to be after a 2 hour wait including 2 breakdowns. The queues for all the major rides were easily an hour plus and never seemed to get shorted despite the parking getting emptier in the evening so unfortunately didn't get to do nearly as much as planned. The park needs to increase the number of single rider options as nothing worse than observing empty seats when in a lengthy queue.None the less, if you go on a week day or out of season I suspect you could get loads done and come out feeling like you've kpjustjust won the lottery",anthony j
40,A Fun Visit,"Getting to the attraction was fairly easy, exits well marked. Parking was a bit of a pain, but manageable. there is a shuttle bus if you need to wait, but quicker to walk. The lines are not long, the rides, mostly all are roller coasters (high speed) There are several places to eat at, no shortage of water fountains. Was there mid week, so there weren't tons of kids and families. Really, fairly relaxed atmosphere. Park staff were very friendly and helpful. They do have a water park, which is now open, so I didn't see it in operation. A Fun visit",brkinlv
50,Awesome!,"Excellent theme park, definitely the best one I've ever visited. Good price and I went during an off time, so it was well worth the $.",David Y
50,My Happiest Place on Earth,"Not really, but it's the place that I can vivist more frequently where I have the most fun. I love the fact that it makes me feel like a kid again, but at the same time it gives me an adrenaline rush that can't be easily matched.My personal favorites (in this particular order) are:X2, Twisted Colossus, Full Throttle, Viper and Batman, but I recommend people to check them all out, since they're all very different and everybody has it's own preferences. Goliath, Riddler's Revenge, Lex Luthor's Drop of Doom (to name a few) are awesome rides as well.",Juan E

50,Great trip!!,"I grew up going to Six Flags in another state and this trip was by far my best! Made the visit with my husband, 13 yo and 11 yo. Rides were spectacular; weather and attendance are not controllable but we had great weather and not a lot of people! We didn't have to wait more than 5 minutes to get on any ride! Even if we didn't have fantastic circumstances, Six Flags Magic Mountain is full of fun and adventures to be had! Memories made to last for sure! If you have difficulties walking, the park is hilly so rent a scooter! There is also an app that you can download for descriptions of rides and such that came in handy for us because some of us have equilibrium issues on certain rides! Definitely a place to put on the ""To Go"" list!",issang
30,"Great rides, disappointing park","We had a great day on the rides here. They were exciting, fun and a great thrill. We were there on a quiet day and did not wait more than 5 mins for any ride without the flash passes. We had planned to buy them on the day if we needed and am glad we did not pre purchase as they would not have made any difference.My disappointment came with the maintenance of the itself. There were cobwebs on the entrances to the rides, weeds amongst the paths and a general feel of neglect on some of the older rides. The park was very clean, no rubbish but needs an overall update. The newer rides looked great but the majority of the park needs an overhaul.All in all, a fun day but they could improve dramatically with a little investment.",Rebecca J
50,lots of fun!!! amazing coasters!!!! hold on! wowwie!!!,"I have been going to magic mountain for years. If you are a rollor coaster lover....this is the place. There is also a water park next door called Huricane Harbor. There are great places to eat in the area, so you can really make it a 4 or 5 day trip out here in Santa Clarita!",Tracyandjjtravels
40,Thrillseekers dream,"This park is a thrill seekers dream and we had so much fun here on our honeymoon. We got the platinum flash pass and I honestly don't think we would've been able to go on all the rides if we didn't get it. It was a slow day but the lines on some of the coaster were still substantial.We also paid for the photo pass, I'm still deciding if that was money well spent as there were only 4 rides with cameras installed.Be prepared for a lot of walking and not just flat ground. Nearly everywhere you walk is either up or down hill and you are constantly climbing stairs. I suffer from an autoimmune disease which effects my legs, so I was extremely sore by the end of the end day. This is also when I noticed that they hire motorised wheelchairs.",Anne-Marie M
50,A must-do if you like rollercoasters,"Long story short, if you love white knuckle roller coasters, you will love this place. Some fantastic rides for the adrenaline junkies out there and more than enough to fill your day.Would highly recommend the Platinum Flash Pass as this saved on some serious waiting time. Plenty of top notch rollercoasters and would definitely go back.",Andy B
40,Beautiful park!,We are from New Jersey. We have season passes to Six Flags great adventure. We live approximately 40 minutes from there. This was the first Six Flags we have tried other than New Jersey. It was incredible!It was nice to ride bunch of different rides than usual. This park was extremely clean. The layout was beautiful. The class of people was higher than we are used to in New Jersey.We had a great time here! My favorite ride was Twisted Colossus. This was an amazing roller coaster! We also really enjoyed Full Throttle. These are MIST DOs!!!,Dale P
50,Must visit for all thrill seekers,Visited Six Flags this week and had a great time enjoying all thrill rides. A day was just sufficient to explore all thrill rides with short breaks in between. A day might not be sufficient if the place is crowded.• Like all amusement parks start at the end and move forward. All rides are definitely enjoyable - the only exception was 'The New Revolution'. The idea of using VR on a thrill ride might be novel but the device doesn’t fit well enough. It can be better enjoyed without that stupid device around your head.• Please bring in and use your Discover card as it gets 5% cash back until end of 2016. With double cash most of you might get 10% cash back. There is also added advantage of separate entry and extended times on some rides - which might be very useful on crowded days.• There aren't many water taps in the park and the ones available dispenses water with tooooo much chlorine. Pack enough water bottles or buy refills in the park.• The car park entrance is about 5 - 10 mins walk from car parking. The park runs shuttle between car park and entrance. Make use of it!• The park offers locker at most rides. Only at X2 you definitely have to leave the bags on paid lockers ($1) and on other rides you can leave them on the sides. Don’t purchase all day locker ($8) deal as it’ll be a waste.• Have fun!!!,Ayan20
10,"Dangerous rides, do not go on Scream","This is my terrifying event at Six Flags Magic Mountain on Saturday March 5th 2016. My friend and I purchased the platinum pass to beat the lines since we are from out of the country we didn't want to spend our day waiting. Around 12pm we decided to go on the ride ""scream"". I got in my seat, 4th row back 3rd seat in and pulled down my restraint and buckled the safely belt. The employees tugged on the restraint and away we went. The roller coaster climbed to the top and then away we went. In the first loop my restraint bust open, I was stopped from flying out by the safety belt. As soon as I had force against me I pulled the restraint back down and it locked back down. For the rest of the ride I was mortified, I was literally scared for my life, every twist and turn made me wonder if the restraint would pop open again and if I was going to fall to my death. I was TERRIFIED.When the ride came in I was shaking, terrified and in disbelief, I honestly could not believe what had happened. I told the two employees standing at the booth/microphone that it popped open and described what had happened. I showed them the seat I was in, where now sat another lady who was ready to go on the ride. They barely cared. No one asked me if I was ok, no one attended to the issue. I am so appalled by the lack of caring and concern not only for me but for the next people who would board this ride! The attendant didn't even leave the booth to check the restraint. They said to me, ""oh ok, what seat was it?"" They looked at each other confused. I was shaking, I had to walk, as I walked away I saw the ride going up the track. I can not believe these employees decided to keep this coaster going and ignored what had happened to me. I am disgusted by the fact Six Flags employees felt it ok to continue operating this ride. Words can not describe how I felt and was treated.I headed to the main office to tell them what had happened. There was a huge line up and so we left. My day and experience was ruined. I have never been so terrified and then disgusted with the lack of concern the park had for my incident. This could have possibly been a tragedy and I don't even get asked if I am ok? Why was this ride not stopped and inspected? This was what I emailed to head office. To this date they have failed to contact me. I would never go back here, it's not safe.",leslie
20,Mediocre Service; Decent Coasters,"Six Flags a company that, across the board, pretty much sets the floor for customer service in the amusement park industry. Magic Mountain is no different. The employees from the top down just don't care and it creates a toxic atmosphere. I had a pass that I got late last year from Fiesta Texas because I travel a lot. They refused to give any discounts associated with the pass because it was from another Six Flags. Their systems couldn't even read my pass except for entering the park. They made no attempt to apologize or offer solutions (such as moving my home park designation). The capacity and efficiency with their attractions are always an abject disaster. The employees clearly could not care less about keeping the line moving. Even on a slow day, lines were long. In one instance, they stopped operation for 20 minutes on one roller coaster to add a train only to decide to remove the train for another 20 minutes. An extra train would not have mattered anyway as they could not keep up with the 2 they had on the track.As far as what they actually have, there are a large number of average roller coasters. X2 and Twisted Colossus are lots of fun. Full Throttle, Superman, and Ninja are some of the better options there as well. The new VR installation on Revolution, on the other hand, is horrible. It is not fun and massively disorienting. On top of that, this compounds the already slug-like pace of Six Flags employees resulting in multiple hour lines. Skip the New Revolution if you are going.Any Six Flags comes with the warning label that the employees will not care one bit about your experience. However, this is probably the best collection of roller coasters in California. Visit at your own discretion.",tumbleweedchris
30,Went here on our 25th Wedding Anniversary vacation in 2006,"My wife and I went here during a 10 day vacation in 2006. We were staying at the Disneyland resort in Anaheim and made the slightly longer than an hour trip to Valencia to visit this park.Being a roller coaster fan, I try to ride as many as I can when I visit, and Six Flags Parks boast an impressive collection of roller coasters at all of their parks. This boast is well founded as they have quite a collection at this park. As a roller coaster destination, it is a roller coaster lover's paradise.What made me give it only three stars is the customer service. The park needs to upgrade their staff training procedures. My wife and I got the impression that we were interrupting their socializing and they seemed to consider us an imposition.So, for roller coasters I give the park a 4 star rating, but for customer service, I give it two stars, hence the 3 star rating.Now, realizing that this review has been made ten years after our visit, and improvements may have already been made in their training procedures, I still would tell any roller coaster fan to visit when they are in Southern California. Hopefully, they have better trained staff.",David F

50,Loads of rollercoasters,"We have season tickets to six flags and we will be visiting 8 different parks on our travels, magic mountain was great we had already booked a flash pass for magic mountain in case it was busy as queues can get very long.The queues weren't too bad on the day we were there as it was slightly overcast and had rained lightly in the morning.We have dining cards as well so we ate three times in the park. You can get value for money with the dining pass especially if you are getting a season one and going to be visiting at least 3 parks.The nachos are a great snack and you get a large portion too.Katy's kettle did average food we had some of the usual chicken tenders and baked spuds with chilli.And the other food place we ate had pretty much the same choices but added a few extras as it was a bigger place. The food is what you would expect albeit a little pricey.We got the free season long drinks too so made use of them.The roller coasters here are amazing and there are so many to do. We loved tatsu but our favourite was twisted collusus which we rode numerous times.Goliath is also great with its 255ft first drop.There are so many good coasters (too many to name them all) to go on here and there is also loads of other thrill and kids rides as well.A great day out here but if you are going to buy a flash pass, get there for opening and judge by the crowds how busy you think it might be as you can get round a massive selection of rides before queues start developing.My advice is go straight to the left up to X2 as it's a great new type of coaster but isn't included standard on the flash pass either so queues get very big, very quickly for it (so does superman) so make this your very first ride when the park opens, then continue in a clockwise direction around the park and you can get a lot of rides done fairly quickly.Definitely worth visiting though when in CA.",Glen C

50,THE BEST!!!,"Every worker is very helpful and friendly.Very spacious, it isn't hard to find rides.There are plenty of places to eat with reasonable prices- Asian, Fries, Hot Dogs etc. Basically park food nothing gourmet.The Rides are very safe, the park is very clean, many bathrooms, best to wear sunblock if ur out- not too much shade areas.Parking is $20.00 at the gate & online, but there are many deals online for affordable tickets such as Advance purchase etc.The Cold Syone Creamy is good, but I recommend the cups- waffle cones were stale & hard.You can buy season pass for a reasonable $80.00.Best time to go is in April when it's empty. I did 7 rides in about 2-3 hours.",christinarodriguez29
40,The best place for roller coaster lovers,"It's amazing the amount of roller coasters that you will find in this place. You won't have enough time to recover from each of them. We bought the Go LA Pass and upgraded to the Flash Pass. We bought the most expensive one, but it was a Sunday and we could have gotten the Silver one, the lines were not so long anyways, but I would definitely recommend buying any of the Flash Passes.",YoaRobe
50,Must-Go if you're a thrill seeker.,This is one of the best theme-parks in the US. Lots of great roller coasters! Highly-recommended to visit.,wcbcruzer
40,Extreme roller coasters!!!,"If you like extreme roller coasters you cannot miss this place, they have really cool ones!!!It would be best if you can try to go on week days as the lines can get really long. If you cannot do that try to get early in the morning (they open at 10:00 AM), because the park tends to fill a lot in the afternoon and the lines are super long; or you can get the flashpass.",AliciaMagdalena
40,Extreme rides gallore,"The theme park is located approximately 40 miles north of Downtown LA. If you like extreme rides then this is the place for you. There are some family friendly rides for younger riders but for the most part this is a park for kids 12 years and older as most extreme rides have a height requirement of 52 inches. Having said that I can tell you this is one of the best places to enjoy if you like these types of rides. You can typically find coupons online and it is best to go during weekday instead of weekend if it is in the summer. Fall, Winter and Spring season the park is open only on weekends.",Roland M
50,Fun and great rides,"Buy the flash pass gold especially if going on a weekend. It was worth every penny, walked on every ride while the lines were 90 mins + had a great time!",Joshua S
50,Fun with Flashpass,"My husband and I ditched the kids with a baysitter and jetted off to LA without a thought of what we were going to do. Hermosa Enterprise recommended Six Flags.We got there in about an hour and parking was easy. Tickets were $62 each online, but we should have bought the season pass for $76 because of all the discounts with a season pass once inside.We lined up for X2 and waited for only 20-30 minutes. Apparently it was closed or something before we got there, so we ended up with a really short line. We saw people running up beside us in line and asked about the ""flash pass"".$80 each (no discount as we didn't get the season pass) and we were set. We skipped lines all day, getting to rude around 10 rides along with casual breaks for food/ice cream between rides. I *highly* recommend it. It went from a day being frustrated just waiting in lines to a day visiting rides and eating when we wanted to.Will definitely go back next time!!",Globe Trotter
50,VIP tickets at Six Flags,"Simple advice. Do it. Better than fast pass. So much betterYour get your own personal tour guide, front of line everytime. Re-rides if you want, food and drink included whenever you want.Our tour guide was fantastic. They knew the park inside out and also made sure other guests that we hopped in front of didn't get annoyed or frustrated.The rides are amazing, but the queues can be long... For everyone else. Waiting times of 60 or 90 mins are quite common, but we walked past it all in a few seconds. Got to the front of the line, got to choose where we wanted to sit (front, back... Anywhere) and often rode more than once.There was no need to rush between rides, no need to queue for food, and the tour guide stayed with us for as long as we needed them to.Food and drink around the park is included as often as you want it and the ability to just grab some bottles of iced water during a hot day with lots of walking was a real bonus.A real experience. I know it's more expensive, but if you want to have a great time enjoying every ride at your own pace with the knowledge you don't have to queue, for anything, this is the way to go.",Danny M
10,IF YOU HAVE MORE THAN 260LBS (120kg) DON'T EVEN BOTHER GOING!!!,"IF YOU HAVE MORE THAN 260LBS (120kg) DON'T EVEN BOTHER GOING!!!Home of the most frustrating experience of my entire life, I went all the way from Brazil to Los Angeles with the main reason being to experience their rollercoasters (as I already been to Disney and Universal in Orlando). The site does not warn anything about being overweight, if it did I wouldn't ever buy the plane tickets.Thing is I purchased their expensive park ticket and wasn't able to go in any of the rides, except for only 2 of them, I waited patiently on their lines just to be kicked out because the safety didn't click enough times. They don't even have the decency of offering test seats before people take the line!When I finally found another ride that I could go, the X2, it was about the end of the day, a soulless red haired woman wouldn't let me ride again or even take the line again, even though it was such a small line, since the park was already closing.The park is dirty, don't come near to the immersion offered by the other parks, few of the lines have sun protection, I got sunburns all over my body, the only good thing was that the stores had 3xl shirts (what an irony).I demand my money back, and that this park at least get some very big warning saying they don't like fat people so guys like me don't bother taking huge trips there just to get disappointed.",Megarushing
40,Rollercoaster Heaven if that is what you like!,"We went to Six Flags as our 2 teenage children requested it on our recent trip to the United States. I remember feeling my jaw drop as we drove into the car park at seeing all the enormous roller coaster frameworks. The excitement from our 2 teens was contagious although my husband and I did wonder what we had got ourselves into! We bought season passes for us all as we were spending 2 days at the park and this was the cheapest option. We bought our tickets on line and went straight into the park when the gates opened. We went in January and the park is only open on weekends so check their times on the website to see when they are open. The weather was sunny and cool. I can imagine that it would be quite hot in summer. We had the most fantastic 2 days and rode most of the rollercoasters. It is a large park and lots of walking is involved so make sure you wear comfortable shoes. We also did not take backpacks so getting on and off rides was much easier than worrying about what to do with your belongings. Our favourites were Twisted Colussus which has just been refurbished, the wooden framed Miners ride which was insanely fast, Goliath which is really tall and goes underground through a short tunnel from the first drop and Tatsu, where you hang suspended from above and look at the ground as you loop around. I chickened out on the X2 but our 2 children went on it and said it was the scariest ride they had ever been on. Unfortunately it had a lot of break downs as did some of the other rollercoasters in the park at different intervals during the 2 days we were there. I am glad that we had 2 days at the park as we managed to go on all the rides, some more than once, otherwise we may have felt cheated out of our money if we were only there for one day. The Sunday was much worse for breakdowns than Saturday. There are plenty of food places to choose from and there are the normal food choices found in theme parks everywhere. We can certainly say we were rollercoasted out by the end of our 2 days.",Lynette S
50,Great Roller Coasters!,"Great rides for the not faint of heart! Terrible, expensive food. Pack a lunch. My teen and Dad loved it in general!",gandtwilk
50,Great visit and no lines!,Were season passholders who live in the East so were so happy our passes worked at this pass. We happen to come duirng the slow time but this meant we had NO LINES. not one. We rode so many rides we could hardly count and were so beat tired by the time we went home! lots of walking but the rides make up for it.One thing I need top point out is the staff. They were some of the friendliest people we met on our trip out West. They were all so friendlly and really made us feel good about california.,Maus10Wardsboro
30,Not for the faint of heart.,"If you love roller coasters or ride that shoot you up in the air and drop you from the sky, this is the place for you. Not for the faint of heart. We did ride some of the ""Rider's in Training"" rides that were okay, but we wouldn't do this again. Great park for young people who love this type of park. Also be aware that there is a lot of uphill walking to the park from the parking lot (killer) and inside the park. Very hard on the legs at times. The best part of the park to us was getting off the rides and going to the sports bar and having a beer and garlic fries....Awesome!!",caron5948
20,"Not Disney,Not Universal and not a tourist attraction","Now that I got the headliner out of the way... No its not either. Its rather outdated, regarding the premises, even Busch Garden's seems betterkept and that says a lot. There is virtual ride that hadnt opened yet. The rides were OK, 10-30 second thrills. If going with a hefty 6'5""+ guy beware, he wont fit due to height in some. There is a logistics problem otherwise, the lines were super long and seats were leaving empty every time for every ride, this was the thing that irritated me the most. And the ones working did not make an attempt to fill any seats, like in other parks. Even if a full row left empty, because a family wanted to go together on the next round. Almost No one used the fast lane really, like other parks. 30min wait. It was just sad that I decided to lose a good tourist day on this. If you are not a local, I say skip if you have another alternative!!!! Try some other Six Flags if you are going for the first time",Drfla1
50,Birthday Trip,"It had been more than 10 years since we visited this park, I asked my young adult kids if they wanted to go to Disneyland or Magic Mountain. They opted for Magic Mountain. It was a great choice. The older rides were still exciting and the new ones were thrilling. The favorite was Full Throttle. It started by launching you into a loop, followed by a dramatic turn. It was a smoother ride than some of the others and a lot of fun. We enjoyed our visit, the water park was closed, I think I heard someone say it was because of the draught. It was a great time, even with the brief periods of rain. A day at the park followed by dinner at Red Lobster, it was an amazing weekend. The type of visit option is incorrect, it only offers family with teenagers or young kids, I took my two kids who are 24 and 25.",Doug S
50,Great Fast Rides,"I love Magic Mountain. The Rollercoaster are the best. If you don't like fast and scary rides, this is not the place for you. I much rather go here instead of Disneyland. The lines aren't as long either. It can get very hot in the summer.",xspechtme
50,Virtual Reality Roller Coaster -- The future has arrived,"As a season pass holder, I was able to get a reservation to ride New Revolution, the first Virtual Reality roller coaster, before it was open to the general public. What a cool ride. The 3-D video takes you through a raid of shooting down an alien space ship attaching San Francisco. Very nice first step toward a totally immersive ride experience. Definitely a new reason to go to Magic Mountain beyond the typical ""fastest, highest, loopiest, scariest roller coaster in the world"" approach. The New Revolution isn't the fastest, scariest ride but the VR experience makes it totally unique. Beware that headsets can only be worn by 13 year olds and older.",Kenneth P
50,Wow,If you are an action junky this theme park is for you. Biggest highest scariest rides I have ever seen!!But a day and get the whole year - great value for locals.,FifiLSydney
50,Roller Coaster heaven,What's not to love if you are an adrenaline seeking roller coaster junkie. We got platinum flash pass tickets which make it an expensive day out for five people howeve it was worth it to skip queues and meant we could ride every ride and most of them twice within one day at the park.,IssyU
40,Good park but not the best,A good park with many good roller coasters! Well spent money getting a flash pass and reducing queuing time!Our favorite roller coaster was Tatsu! Frightening and thrilling at the same time!Be there well in advance before the park opens to get in line!,MAL
10,BE AWARE -- CUSTOMER SERVICE AND MEMBERSHIP FRAUD,"First this review is in regards to the online season pass ordering and then the horrific membership service that you may need to endure after. First some of the WORST telephone service experience and email experience I have ever had with any company in my lifetime. I purchased 4 season passes for my family and 3 dinning passes. I was charged for 4 season passes 3 full year dinning passes and 1 membership dinning pass. That one alone they are charging me 13.99 a month for! I DID NOT SIGN UP FOR THAT. On the website it said that it was 7 something a month for the dinning membership pass. I decided to pay for the dinning passes in advance and that is exactly what I did. You would think this is a really easy thing to fix. I look at my bills, I realize 6 flags is charging me and extra $14 a month I never signed up for. I call six flags and they stop the charge, right? WRONG!!! After going to the park, being given a phone number to call just to never get through on it, finally sending an email through the website only to be treated with complete disrespect and like a child, then finally emailed a phone number that I called to be again treated on the phone terribly, told they do not refund anything and that I was absolutely wrong and they would do nothing about it. I then asked the guy what he was seeing on his screen. ""I did not pull up your account, it does not matter what is showing we do not offer refunds or cancellation"" WOW WOW WOW was he kidding me? 10 minutes arguing with me to tell me he never even opened my account? That is the beginning of speaking to 4 different people at 4 DIFFERENT phone numbers I was given to call all with a minimum of 5 prompts you have to go to in order to get a rude and absolutely completely useless person on the other end. The final person I spoke too said all he can do is escalate my request to another manager which I asked him to do and he said they would have to call me back at their convenience. We live in Southern California and there are a ton of amusement park options. PICK ANYTHING BUT SIX FLAGS. If this is how they treat paying customers then how much do they really care about your kids and the safety of their parks compared to the bottom line of how much money they can possibly take from people. This whole experience is the epitome of what is wrong with any form of large corporate mentality. GIVE YOUR BUSINESS TO SOMEONE ELSE. If you have a problem at all you will be treated like crap and it is not worth it!!",Genesis W
50,Nice park with lots of options,"Fortunately we went at a slow time for the park so wait times were very short. Park had a multitude of rides for all kinds. My only complaint is that the park needs to consult some engineers to see if there is any way to deflect the noise from Superman: The Ride. This ride is deafening to those on the ground. If it as loud riding it, I would say it would be unsafe from a decibel standpoint.",dusty1196
50,awesome,"had a great day hard to fit everything in on oneday, recommend the fast pass only the basic one food is expensive",jontid2016
50,Best Roller Coasters!,"I'm the fan of Roller Coaster and this place is the best Roller Coasters rides that i have been in my life.

50,Six flags magic mountain,The park was really really really funMake sure you go on full throttle that one is the best!Also remember no food allowed in the park and no selfie stick either,roseb985
30,Teens enjoyed the rides but...not worth it,There were several rides that were closed and so were most of the concessions. The park is also pretty dirty and the bathrooms were more so. It also started raining and there are very few places to get shelter from the elements.The one thing that really upset me was that you can't bring in any food and they charge ridiculous prices for what they have which is not a healthy selection. It is all grease and sugar.We came as part of a group but I will not be back on my own.,the_owl6
50,Roller Coasters to the max,"if you are looking for pure sensation without all the fluffy part of the other theme parks, then Magic Mountain is the place to go.You go there for Roller coasters and you will get them.More than 10 different kinds, types ... from speed, to loops, to swirls to Russian mountains ... if you leave form there not having enough of roller coaster then you need help.If you can go there on a week day off school vacations and you will barely wait more than 10 minutes on average.Would be great though that the website indicate in advance which roller coaster are closed on a given day ... we could not have access to X2 and Virtual reality one for example.",Gaëtan P
50,Great Fun,This is a great park for thrill rides. There are at least two in every area of the park. Best bet is to get there early and use the Fast Pass. We were able to get on almost everything we wanted and it was good Friday during Spring Break. Fast Pass was worth the investment.,johnpV4713TS
50,Great time,"Had a great time, better than expected . Lines were not too long and music vds helped pass the tome.",respino5
50,Platinum flash-pass is a must!,We recently ended our month long North American holiday with a visit to Magic Mountain. If you're visiting from outside L.A. or especially if you are visiting from overseas I cannot recommend the platinum flash pass enough. At first we were a little sceptical of spending an additional US$125 for the pass ($110 plus additional $15 to add the X2) on top of US$75 general admission but after a day of straight to the front of the line roller coaster action we were all so glad that we did. There were still 5-10 minute waits at most rides but when you compare that to 30-45 minute waits (2hour wait for X2 due to only one car running) we were able to cram in a lot more ride time. Plus the little tamagotchi like electronic device has the added benefit of informing you when rides are reopened when stopped due to inclement weather as they were on the day we went. Do it you won't regret it.Best rides in my opinion 1.Twisted Colossus 2. X2 3. Full Throttle,Jake H
40,Great for all ages! - DIRTY!!!,"Magic Mountain is a great place to visit if you love roller coasters. We got there an hour before the park opened, and we waited 10 minutes to start walking torwards a ride. Don't let the ""no outside foods allowed"" sign afraid you, we brought a bunch of energy bars and the people didn't notice. Lots of good rides, but the entire park is so filthy. You would expect a multi-million dollar company to be able to repair a theme park, but they can't. A billboard with Wonder Woman on it is falling apart... Bathrooms are very dirty, and the food sucks, but 4 stars for the fun",Sloth M
50,Roller coaster heaven,I thought I had died and gone to roller coaster heaven. At age 48 I still love the thrilling rides at Magic Mountain and it keeps getting better! I live a few hours away and only get visit about every 2 years but it seems like they have a new coaster every time I visit. I usually go during the week when the lines are not long. The last time I went the employees seemed to be making great efforts to make our visit the best that it could be. Always a fun experience!!,799andreias

50,KB,"Loved this park when I was younger. Always a thrill seeker and loved the coasters. Now not so much. Sont mind Goliath its fast but doesnt spin me upside down and all around to where I have vertigo when I am riding it and for about an hour after. Again, Im not as young as I use to be. But I love taking my kids to ride. It seems as though the management has worked on keeping the park clean and nice. Definitely a place for kids in the kid ride area or a thrill seeker ride as it is the roller coaster capital.",Kyle B
10,Waste of time and money.,"Excitedly got to the park at 10:30am having looked forward to visiting Six Flags for decades. Parked up and bought tickets (25min wait) then the problems started. Went through security and then hit a wall of people. Queued for over an hour to get into the park. Was only given one ticket for two of us which added more delays. Queued for two hours to ride X2 that said it had a capacity of 1600 people an hour. We counted 32 people going past every 5.5 minutes (around 352 per hour) then we discovered only one car was running. Having ridden many rollercoasters in my 40 years, I was expecting big things but after the first two drops the rest of the ride was disappointing. By this time it was 1:30pm and we had been on one ride. Managed to get on Viper quickly and it was a classic older ride. After a long search for the entrance to the New Revolution we queued only to be told we hadn't pre-registered on the Internet. We then queued for 30 mins for food in a line with only three people in it. The food was good but not $40 good. It was nearly 3pm with only two rides behind us. By this time the queues for Katsu etc. were showing 90 mins and we'd just had enough. The whole park is tired looking and shabby and a lot of rides were closed. Factoring in this being one of our seven days in the USA and all the associated costs of actually being in LA, along with the car hire and the $20 parking fee and the food then we would have been better off burning $500 on the beach. If you're in LA for a week and value a good experience then give this place a miss. It made Alton Towers in the UK seem amazing in comparison.",Chimpass
50,Awesome as usual but even better this time!,We were given to opportunity to be one of the 1st to experience the NEW REVOLUTION VR COASTER. This mad our regular visit extra special ! Being a Season Pass holder has more benefits now than ever. We found out on this trip!!! We were introduced to the SEASON PASS HOLDER PICTURE PASS. As we are regulars and COASTER lovers. We always buy the ONE pic from the ONE coaster! Now we bought the SEASON PIC PASS. GET ALL THE PICS YOU WANT AS MANY AS YOU WANT FOR BOTH PARKS! You can go in and edit your pics and create T shirts you name it! This picture pass made the park we have been going to for almost 10 years new again.!! Excellent experience. #seasonpass #seasonpasspicturecard.. Do it! Your family will have the time of their lives and a lifetime of memories : ),bfitbybb
50,Totally for the Young.,"I took my family over to Magic Mtn over spring break and my kids, had a blast. I looked up the rides before we went expecting to ride about 12 rides because of the height restriction however we got much more. There were many more rides we didn't expect for example the Viking ship, tweety birds cages. In addition, we got to take pictures with Bugs Bunny and the famous Daffy Duck. The park is not only aimed for the thrillest but the kids who are always adventurous. We went at a great time where there were no lines and the kids took it to their advantage. My wife and I were very impressed with the park and staff and roller coaster upgrades. Also, I was expecting to spend a lot on food however they had lunch packages for the family which I Thot was great. My family bought a large pizza and 4 drinks at a great price. Last, we waited in line for the famous funnel cake. My family and I are going to go back again real soon. I hope they visit and market their products at local High schools, and university offering discounts. I don't think Magic Mtn markets enough and should be on the AAA discount list with season passes. Also, because it rained and we didn't get to purchase souvineers, they should market online with their products. Especially their light up capes. This is a park where everyone can enjoy.",Fraggle1tocks
30,There is improvement to be made!!! Rides are worth every penny,"So the rides are awesome 🙆 we had such a fun time in the rides. But, the food was disgusting 😐!!!!! And the food prep area is disgusting and dirty, and easy over priced!! So you can get a meal pass... That may make it better if you go often. I didn't try and take any food in but, i heard there is no outside food allowed because they want to buy the food inside. Well, even Disneyland allows outside food now. I think they should also take more time to train employees. Probably to cut down on costs they hire young kids to run operations. Gave you ever seen what a teenager does to their room or kitchen. They make a mess and don't clean up, week that's what the food places look like. Take time to train your employees. A chicken strips with fries 🍟 and a drink was 20$. And the quality was worse than Carla Jr. Another complaint is that when it started raining ☔ I went into the store to get a sweater and bought one only to see there were ponchos being sold. The price in the poncho was 7$ and they were trying to sell it to me for 8$ doing the price went up.... Seriously??? You can have a price in something and verbally lift the price by the dollar 💵 who does that... Massive mountain does... Total disappoint.... If these improvement could be made maybe it become if better value... If you need someone to run your operations department I would gladly accept the position 😊 p.s. A nice man gave me a trash bag to wear while ur was training 👍",sweetsher9877
30,"Very good rides, but the park needs improvements","Having gone there with a group of teenagers, the rides were fabulous, but as an adult the place needs repair. Bathrooms were bad, pitted floors, broken stalls, etc. One restaurant we went into had a broken window that someone ""repaired"" by gluing a piece of plexiglass to the frame on the inside instead of properly glazing a piece of glass in position.",rjr1012
40,GREAT place...,"We had a great day here today, despite the rain! We were there for the gates opening, so got on quite a few rides before the first rain...we then got on more rides before the hail & rain!We enjoyed all the rides, but I've got to say the Twisted Collosus is the most EPIC ride I've ever been on. It felt like a proper old coaster, with a mega modern twist! I wasn't expecting the speed & the pure craziness of the ride!!Lots of great rides, Tatsu, Apocolypse, Batman etc...A shame we got rained off & had to leave earlier than planned, but still had a good day.My only issue, was the cost of onsite food...crazy prices!!!!Carole : )",Carole S
20,Rundown Conditions,"If you want BIG roller coasters this is the place to go. The food was outstanding with lots of different choices (jalapeno beer batter fish) and the prices are typical for a theme park. I do like that if you buy a souvenir cup you get free refills all day and .99 cent the rest of the year. The park is laid out horribly with lots of walking and little shade. Forewarned, the only thing at the top of the hill is Ninja roller coaster so not worth the walk. Also the place is run down and definitely is missing a lot of maintenance. The bathrooms are the worst EVER. I have been in forest service bathrooms in better condition, which makes you wonder how well the rides are maintained. There was a huge crowd and therefore you had to buy their flashpass just so you could get some rides in and at least the gold flashpass. As someone else stated, the people could be a bit sketchy, definitely stay with your children.",rockinhikers
20,Before spring break.,Lots not open.big lines. Several broke down while an hr wait. Que jumpers.food super expensive. 4 rides for 240 bucks. So not worth it.,whistlerfam

The first thing you pass before entering the metal detector into the park is a LA Sheriff station. That should be your first clue. It is not a park for young kids.",Dave K
40,Had a Blast!,"Spent the day here with our 3 kids on Spring break. Our youngest is 6 years old and just over 48"" tall so was able to go on a lot of rides. We purchased flash pass or all 5 of us and although we didn't need it for the first couple hours it started to get busy and we were glad we had them. We broke it up into 2 flash passes. One with 3 people and the other with 2. It worked out well so one of us could take off and use it to go on some of the smaller rides like the ninja and gold rusher with our 6 year old while the others used it for the bigs rides. Food was very expensive but expected. Everyone had a great time. Full throttle and Lex Luther drop of Doom were our favourites. Had a great day here and can't wait to come back.",Willie_Lovitt

Platinum may be a bit much for the average person but if you want to ride 25 coasters in a day, this is the way to go.",LVRealtor89052
50,Magic Mountain is Awesome!,"Great park if you are a rollercoaster junkie! Tons of great rollercoasters, but not a great park for small children. Very limited selection for toddlers and kids under 42 inches. They have really cleaned up the place. We have been there twice this year and have been impressed with the improvements. No security issues.",Bookburner451
30,Unwelcoming entrance but OK rides,"It is a major amusement park with many rides, but generally it is not too welcoming to customers; advertized bus from the Bay side did not come, long lines in a very hot and shadeless access area, and you have to buy mutiple day entry tickets even if your are there for one day only. Best part we thought was old Roar wooden roller coaster. Inside some trees and shade, OK",MobileDane
50,For thrill seekers!,"Probably the best amusement park in the world! It has 18 big roller coaters in different categories (such as stand-up, vertical drop, pseudo dual-track). All of them have unique features and are really fun and thrilling! It is difficult to find similar roller coasters all in one park in other parts of the world. Unfortunately, I believe this park is not for you if do not like roller coasters. I am a big roller coaster fun myself and I rarely get dizzy. However, I had quite a headache after riding 10 roller coasters in 3 hours (there was no queue on the day I visited coz the weather forecast reported a possible storm on that day. It is actually my problem for not spacing going onto the rides apart...)",Bobiguous

30,Not Such A Good Time!,"Went with my husband & 3 kids. What started out as an exciting day was short lived.It was excruciatingly hot! So hot we got stuck for 20 minuted hanging backwards on a roller coaster because the rides were over heating. Waiting in long lines with the sun beating on you only to find out the ride was shut down due to heat. My 11 year old over heated & got very sick, throwing up. We kept everyone very hydrated but it didn't work. people were passing out on lines left & right. We loved the rides we did get on & made the best out of the experience as we traveled far & long. However, if we do return it will be during the winter not summer.",CLopes2012
40,10 coasters in a day,"The park lives up to its reputation and is widely spread. The coasters are of different categories, 4d, standing,floorless and they all have something different and fun to offer.",Google29
40,Fun but long waits,I would recommend a flash pass if you want to ride all of them.We spent there the whole day and we couldn't ride all of the Extreme thrill ones.,Pablo A
10,Total RIP-OFF,"I dont usually write reviews but i felt obliged after visiting today.-After waiting for a couple of hrs for the X2 ride, it was announced that there would be no rides until they fixed a technical issue they had. We moved to another ride, only to hear the same voice an hour later that this ride also had an issue and would freeze until it was all back up. After 3.5hrs in the park we had taken 0 rides.- There is no control on how many ppl get in. The park was super crowded, wait time was like 90 min per ride. Of course this was just another way for them to get into your pocket since you were given options to move faster through the queue for up to 125$. We figured out that since we were there already it was pointless to spend the whole day waiting in the queue and we bought the flash passes. Yet, we still didnt manage to get into two of the main attractions because the wait time was so long.Just to be fair the staff was very friendly and helpful, its just all the setup that was a mood-killer and didnt worth our time. I wouldn't visit again.",Panos P
40,Good weekend!,It was great the only bad thing was that they closed too early :/But i recommend the park for everyone who likes exciting things.If you go to Los Angeles California you should go to Six Flags Magic Mountain!!,OrugaCullen
50,Awesome roller coaster park,"We went on the first Sunday of spring break (family of four, teenage youth), and had a fantastic time. We purchased a Gold Flash Pass, as we only could visit for a single day, with a supplemental charge to ride X2. As with all theme parks, if you want to actually ride a lot of rides, then you need to arrive at least 60 minutes before the posted opening time and head straight for the back of the park upon arriving. For a busy day, arriving in the parking lot line 90 minutes prior to the posted opening time is not too early.We started at Full Throttle, as it was not available for reservation on our Flash Pass, then got our Flash Pass, and headed for Tatsu. We then rode Ninja, and headed for Apocalypse. From there we rode the major thrill rides in clockwise order, ending with Viper and X2. That worked out well for us, though a couple of unplanned glitches caused us to miss Goliath, which was disappointing. All in all, this touring plan worked well for us.Everyone in our group loved X2 and Tatsu. Other rides had their advocates as well. This is absolutely the best roller coaster park on the west cost and I highly recommend it.I have read lots of complaints here about the cost and quality of the food. We ate at JB's BBQ, and all of us, including the one vegetarian, thought it was great. It was about $7/person more that I would expect to pay for a similar meal outside of a theme park -- not a terrible premium at all. The line length was reasonable at 1PM, and there was plenty of seating.Here is my recommend ride order with a Gold Flash Pass:Full ThrottleGet Flash PassHonda ExpressTatsuNinjaApocalypseGold RusherRiddlerGreen LanternBatmanLex LuthorScreamGoliathViperX2",sftraveler34
20,"Wait, wait, don't tell me there's only one car running","Park was NOT open during spring break for many schools (March 14-18), which we heard many people complain about. Therefore, one would think the ride maintenance would be done before the weekend starting 7-day per week operation. One would be disappointed. Many popular rides only had one car operating. When coupled with pent-up demand from spring break, the park was overwhelmed ""opening weekend"". Lines were incredibly long, made worse by malfunctioning audio equipment that played two tracks simultaneously so even the cartoons were useless, even annoying. The restrooms were not clean, the food counters were understaffed, the entry lines were a mass of confusion, and the ride wait times were completely disconnected from reality. The process for flash pass was annoying to those of us waiting in line. There were large intervals of no""regular riders"" boarding due to flash pass. I have a season ticket, but I think I don't need that frustration. The rides are generally pretty good, but hard to justify 11 hours only getting on 7 rides (and two of those in about 40 minutes due to Discover card early entry).",BasketCase24
50,Holiday lights,This year they decorated the park for the holidays. We had season passes so we just came for a few hours when it was dark so we could see them. They were beautiful. My 5 and 9 year old really enjoyed them. The lines were really long so we didn't go on any thing. It was freezing so we made sure to buy hot chocolate. They had places where you could roast marshmallows for a pretty good price.,Rachel L
50,Awesome park!,"The food and amenities are a little on the expensive side, that aside the rides in this park are top notch. Had an easy time getting around the park with young children. The wait times at the rides were about average for a Saturday on the first day of spring break. You should definitely get the season pass if you plan on returning even once more the same year.",danb267
10,Don't Care for the Disabled,"Ok, so this was suppose to be the highlight of me & my dauhhters' vacation, but it was the worst! My youngest is in a wheelchair, but the staff there did not care at all. I was given grief about going through the exits to get on the rides. What was I suppose to do? Carry the wheelchair up rhe stairs or hold her 50lbs self as we stood in line? I go to the supervisor, she tells me the access pass is technically only for the bigger rides, not for the kiddie rides. So I take that to mean other disabled children don't visit the park, right? My disabled child will not be visiting again!!",Charletta C
30,Don't expect cleanliness or upkeep like other parks!,"Crowded, dirty, uncared for.But fun as hell.Long lines in summer- come early.NOT worth it unless it have a coupon or a deal. Full price is not worth $$$",NATNCHAP
40,Always fun.... and great for roller coasters!,"One of my favorite theme parks in the US.... Definitely go if you like roller coasters!. Just like every other theme park, expect the lines. If you do not want lines head about an hour south to Knotts Berry Farm",jasonk7777
50,If you are in to Roller Coasters you should go!,"The most exciting thing to do on a sunny day and you will be without voice at the end of the day! So many high level roller coasters and a few more things like the DC and Looney Tunes characters appearing and taking pictures. Great food, all kinds of it, and beverages to every taste.",Henrique S
50,Roller Coaster Heaven!,"Six Flags Magic Mountain, an amusement park located in Valencia, CA is a wonderful experience if you love roller coaster thrills. Plan on spending the whole day there, as lines for some of the more popular attractions can be long. According to my SmartWatch, I usually walk 5 or more miles, so comfortable shoes are a must! In addition to thrill rides, there are many family-oriented attractions as well. Since you can't bring in your own snacks, make sure you have budgeted for food, especially if you are bringing the family. JB's BBQ is a personal favorite, the pulled pork and tri-tip sandwiches are really good.",kgold_smvll
50,"AMAZING, Everyone should go, once in their lifetime.","In the same way everybody should visit their favorite country, everyone should go to sixflags, its an amazing experience that you will never forget, and Im pretty sure that your adrenaline reserves either.",YordisPD
50,Coaster Fun,"Definitely a great place if you are interested in riding roller coasters. There is a huge selection, but don't let the lines get you down. Some of them move very fast. Definitely recommend getting there early to get to some of the best rides with little lines.",reader_girl932
40,Thrilling rides,"The rides are what you go to use, so that's all I did. I went on as many rides as I could in the time allowed. The lines were long but with a fast track pass you were on a ride before you could quit. The rides themselves feel very secure and are some of the best I've ever been on. There are plenty of different rides in case large rollercoasters aren't for you",Josh Garvey
10,Have not had a worse experience at a theme park...,"My son is leaving for the Marines soon. I thought it would be fun to take a Dad/Son trip to Los Angeles. On Sunday we went to Six Flags Magic Mountain.Over the past 30 years, I have been to dozens of theme parks throughout the country. I have not had a worse experience.We arrived by car at the gate about noon. It took one hour to get parked. After we parked and walked for 20 minutes, we waiting another 90 minutes simply to get through security. Once through security, we waiting in another 45 minute line to get in the park. We walked to the ride X2 and waited in line for 30 minutes to find out it would be an additional 2 hours in line to ride. We decided to try another ride. We walked to the wooden roller coaster, ""Apocalypse"". We waited in line for an hour and a half for the 45 second ride.We did not eat as the lines were also 30 minutes long.We did ride a couple more rides the remainder of the day, but the experience was abysmal. Nine hours at the park and only five rides.If you are thinking about going to Six Flags and don't enjoy spending 1-3 hours in line for each ride, don't do it. Go to Disneyland or Knotts Berry Farm for the shorter lines!",Zach0812
40,So much fun!,Six Flags has 19 rollercoasters.Although we were there in February (which i think is low season) the lines are so long.It's not ok with a waiting time of more than an hour for each attraction,nikeStockholm
10,Worst theme park experience ever,"We visited on Sunday February 28th, and it was the worst experience I have ever had. We queued over an hour just to park (they closed the car park about 20 minutes after we got in, and there was still hundred of cars queueing), over an hour of queuing again to get our bags searched through security, then we got into the park to find over two and a half hour queues for every ride, over an hour for food, and about a half hour just to buy a drink. Even the toilets had queues of 15 minutes and they were filthy and stank. We didn't even get to go on any rides due to the queues and rides breaking down, and two of the water rides had ""temporarily closed"" signs due to ""technical difficulties"", yet it was clear they hadn't been open in a while, the third water ride just had a chain over the entrance with no info, there was no info at the gate about these being closed or obvious info on the website. The staff were rude and disorganised or simply just invisible, after seeing the parking attendant it was over an hour and a half until we next saw someone. On a quiet day the rides wold probably be fun, but with no way of knowing how bust it will be it's definitely not worth wasting the money! It appears that the business was in part due to a ""bring a friend free"" promotion for season pass holders and a cheer leading contest being held in the park, surely someone planning park events would realise that these would combine to make a far too busy day, the lack of preparation for this shows a complete lack of respect for customer experience and customer safety.",Hannah F
50,Love it!! Fright fest is AMAZING!,Just went to six flags for the rides and did not even think about it being Halloween time.... but holly molly I was so glad it was! Amazing haunted houses and mazes. I was so terrified and excited at the same time!!!!,Jo O
20,"Great rides, terrible service","This park has so much potential. But it gets so crowded, and the service is so bad, that my experience today was so bad I might never be back. Literally had to wait 45 min to get a bottle of water. Two hours to get food. 30 min for ice cream. Insane amounts of people. Terrible service. Only 3 valet guys for thousands of people. The only 'restaurant' in the park, a sports bar, had an hour and a half wait at 2:30pm, and they were totally understaffed. The whole upstairs was empty because they didn't have enough servers...on a day when they had to close the park because of over capacity. INSANE. Someone should get fired for such negligence. I had four 11 year olds that were crying because we couldn't get food or water. Unreal.",aarentow
50,50 th birthday spent haveing time of my life!,"if you want rollercoasters theres no better place to go to ride them. this park is amazing for thrill rides the only downfall is its expensive once inside no outside food or drink so be prepared, also buy the fast passes / 3 options to choose from we did platinum no wait times for rides however very pricey as well but woth it",kmartinez1966
50,Fright Fest,My husband and I visited in October 2015. We flew from Canada to Phoenix where we spent a week and then drove to Santa Clarita Six flags. Well worth the trip! Fright fest was awsome but busy. I would suggest upgrading to fast pass. It seems very expensive but worth is especially if you came all the way from Canada. You don't really want to miss out on anything because it is busy.,Alberta Wanderer

40,A family tradition,I have been going to Magic Mt. since I was a young child. Love the thrill rides. Kids can't get enough. This may not be Disney but I also do not need to take out a second mortgage to afford the trip. Don't miss Twisted Colossus. Super fun!!!,Ken H
20,Gross Park,I've lived in SoCal all my life but I finally went to Six Flags recently and wasn't impressed with the conditions of the park. I guess I'm just used to the cleanliness of Knotts and Disneyland because this place had visible puke stains (not to mention the smell) around a lot of the rides. I hate roller coasters so my review might not be helpful to those who don't mind feeling extremely dirty after getting out of the park :(,Tamara V
50,Thrilling park,"One of the best amusement park I've been in my life. My friends and I visited this park in June 2015, and it offers a lot and a lot of attractions but you will have to love sensational rides, otherwise you have nothing to do there.For lunch, if you are hungry I recommend Panda fast food, it's worth the money spent.If you are visiting LA or California you really have to stop by this place for one or two days !",discovertheworld777
40,Great day out,"Spent a day here in June 2015. The rides at the park are excellent, and food and drink choices are plentiful across the park. Magic Mountain certainly has the best collection of rollercoasters of any one park, though queueing arrangements aren't always clear (X2 states you need to put bags in a locker, with no indication that the lockers are located at the front of the line). Unfortunately Goliath and Escape from Krypton weren't operating on the day I was there, which is rather worrying to have multiple rides down in peak season. Other than that, however, the park was great for a thrillseeker like me and well worth a visit.",akkejakke
50,Awesome,"Love six flags rides, the roller coaster are insane, I recommend six flags Magic mountain for everybody who wants to have fun",Karla C
50,Review from a fifty-something gay guy...,"First time at the park. I went with two buddies and we had a blast. For those of you wanting ride reviews skip down a few paragraphs.From the reviews below I was expecting Magic Mountain to be very run down, dirty and ill-run. All I can say is our experience was great. Bought and printed all the tickets: parking and Flashpass reservations at home. Entry to the park was easy, we used valet parking which was efficient and saved time. Flashpass was a good splurge, we literally never waited more than 5 minutes for a ride (Saturday mid February). We opted for the platinum passes, in retrospect I might go for the Gold to save money, and also have a little more time between rides (basically to recover a little!)I've been to Disneyland and California Adventure many times, and while Magic Mountain isn't as manicured as either of them, it is certainly not a rundown pit. I never saw litter, there are a lot of trees and shady areas, eating areas were not too crowded, bathrooms were just OK (but not horrible as some report). Also, not one rude employee experienced the whole day, on the contrary. Food is not that expensive, it's like airport prices.I sort of have to respond to the review below, where the ""caucasian"" family from Oregon was uncomfortable and felt in danger! First, just, wow. Yes, it's not all white people. Who would expect that it would be? As a white, gay, male over the age of 50, I was definitely in an underrepresented demographic. But all I saw was a diverse crowd -- lots of latinos, blacks, asians and whites who were having fun in the park. I certainly never felt in danger or like I wasn't welcome. Never experienced or saw any unpleasant behavior!!Now, I did feel in danger on the rides, and for those of you, who like me, are doing their due diligence and reading lots of reviews about the rides before they get to the park, here is what I experienced/learned. (First, so you know, I'm a reluctant thrill seeker, I wasn't the instigator in the group, I was more along for the ride. Once I'm in a theme park though I kind of get into the experience.)Batman - First ride of the day. Easy, good place to start. (Fun: 8, Intensity 6)Twisted Colossus - Hearkens back to the classic roller coaster look, very classy somehow, and really exciting. A few barrel turns. (Fun: 10, Intensity 9)Full Throttle - Last ride of the day. Tallest loop. A little whiplash inducing, but not bad and it's over quick. (Fun: 8, Intensity 10)Gold Rusher - Kid's ride, but cute and nice among the trees. (Fun: 8, Intensity 3)Ninja - Older, flying sort of ride. Suspended. Junior version of Tatsu sort of? (Fun: 8, Intensity 7)Scream - Nasty. It's a good fast ride, but it is very fast and twisty. No one in group wanted to do it again. (Fun: 4, Intensity 10)Superman - Fun and fast, and, hey, no loops or turns! (Fun: 10, Intensity 10)Riddlers Revenge - Not good for men is true. We found that out. (Fun: 4, Intensity 9)Tatsu - It is smooth and it is terrifying. (Fun: 9, Intensity 10)Goliath - The feeling of being near blackout was true for one of our party, and one of us did it twice. Interestingly, both of them prefer this to Scream and would do it again. (Fun: 10, Intensity 10)X2 - Two of us were forewarned and decided to pass. One of us did it and said it was extremely disorienting and not fun. (Fun: 3, Intensity 10)Viper - Scared off by reviews.Green Lantern - Two of us were forewarned and decided to pass. One of us did it and said it was extremely painful. (Fun: 0, Intensity 10)",hanapali
20,Poorly run,"The roller coasters are fantastic, which is why we went.The lines are so poorly managed though I doubt I will ever return.They nearly always had at least one car (and sometimes up to 5) with an open seat. Sometimes they even allowed a fully open row or two. Our average wait was about and hour per ride. The rides are manages by teenagers who spend no time trying to move the lines along or to fill the cars. These people speak unintelligible instructions into loudspeakers that are so loud that it hurts your ears. They also offer a flash pass that allows you to go to the front of the line (for a ridiculous amount of $). Those people went to the front of the line and we watched up to six cars full of these people fill cars before they allowed any of the general people to board. They are apparently given absolute priority. They also allowed those people to fill one person per row locking out the rest w empty seats. They also do not allow any food or drink into the park so you must buy everything in the park (drinking fountains are rare if they even exist). Unless you are prepared to pay over $200 a person for a day at this park it is not worth going. I plan never to return.",DrZzzzz
40,Roller Coaster Lover's Heaven,"I think that in order to get the most out of this park, you really need to love Roller Coaster's... I wish that the park was just kept a little nicer and cleaner as we have annual passes here and at Disneyland, and six flags hardly compares.",Kaisertod

20,Has really gone downhill ever since being saved from closure,"I went there with my husband for a private party through my company one day, as we haven't been there in a while. For a private party for select companies, it was pretty crowded, which was surprising as I had attended private parties there before and there were never this crowded -- I came to discover that the park put on their website a special code in order for anyone to attend the after hours party, which kind of defeats the purpose of a private party.We went in at 5pm after work, and were only there for 3 hours and rode 4 rides, partly due to the large crowds, but also because of the lack of cleanliness and questionable individuals allowed into the park. There was trash everywhere, and having random pieces of plywood set up to block off areas no longer used just looks lazy and tacky. The food is your basic amusement park food, but was really inedible and made me feel ill afterwards. As for the questionable individuals who are allowed in, it shows why this is the only amusement park in Southern CA that has metal detectors at its gate -- we saw many different situations of individuals attempting to start fights or problems with others, seemingly for no reason other than to cause problems.It's a far cry from what it was prior to almost closing from lack of funds. The company that decided to save the park seemed to have good intentions, but the park has lost alot of what made it so much fun in the past.",irishsiren32
50,Best Park Ever!,Magic Mountain has the most intense and incredibly creative coasters I have ever seen. They do a great job of alleviating the pain of waiting in line with shade and entertaining programming. The employees are all so friendly and professional. You can tell they love working there. I have been to many six flags and this is by far the best one.,Eva B

The pathways are wide and even on a holiday (Presidents' Day) it did not feel crowded. It was easy enough to find fun rides that had less than an hour wait. The newer rides are smooth and employees are friendly. I can't wait to go back this summer!",ourlibertybeach
50,Best Theme Park,"Have been here twice, and without a doubt the best theme park I have been to, bar none.The best coasters there are, so my recommendation is to get yourself there and try this place.Amazing!!",chrisede
40,Brilliant but expensive,First off this isn't cheap.. If you want the fast track passes be prepared for a wallet busting surprise. We booked in advance for 4 adults and 3 fast passes (one adult hates roller coasters!!!). We visited in February on Superbowl day so it was quiet but still busy by any other park's standards ! With flash passes and entry it was approx 660$ for 4 but we did get to go on every single coaster we wanted to. After factoring in lunch and refreshment costs some rough math worked out each ride was approx $20 each for each person. If you're there for a couple of days I'd recommend not getting the flash pass and buying an extra days ticket. After 5p the park started to empty..perfect for tlany last minute rides. My favourite was the twisted collusus!,Nick D
50,19 Roller Coasters.....Enough Said,"I went on a Saturday in February which means.....even though the park was relatively empty, the lines were still long because most of the rides (the ones that were actually open) were only running one train. That sucked. We managed to get to 7 roller coasters. Full Throttle is AWESOME!!! The hype video before the ride featuring Ray Lewis made this Cane really happy. Superman and X2 have been on my ""roller coaster bucketlist"" for a while. I was able to conquer Superman but X2 was sadly closed. The restrooms were gross. I understand it's a theme park but the park was no where near crowded. I am def looking forward to my return trip to knock out the other coasters.",HurricaneRu
50,Awesome but expensive,"So awesome but so expensive inside the park. The waiting line is endless, they should put moer cars on the ride, and also they can low the prices al ittle bit, i paid 40 dolars for chicken and soda. tha´s the only bad thing i found in the park, the rides are awesome, its worth the waiting.",alejandro_lolo9090e
50,Awesome time!,"Having barely been on a roller coaster before I was nervous about going here but ended up having one of the best times ever. There was loads of different rides and i managed to go on almost all of them apart from the superman because it broke down. I would advise getting the queue jump pass like I did, I barely had to wait at all to get on each ride where as others were waiting for 1-2 hours. Don't go on the rapids first unless you wanna spend the majority of your day wet, I learned from my mistake.",Rory D
50,Looking for fun and thrilling rides,"Magic Mountain is just that place, I like that there is something for everyone in the family, I like to hang out with my small grand children in The Bugs Bunny area, the kids love the little roller coasters, the older kids love all the thrill rides, last I checked their favorite was Superman, but they ride them all over and over. I have a season pass and live just 10 minutes away, so I spend a lot of time there.",Joy S
50,A day full of adrenaline,"We went to this park knowing little about the rides. When we get to see the rides from outside the park we were absolutely scared! But we manage to get into Batman and after that everything got better. It was a slow day at the park so we get to ride our top picks. Our top rides where X2 (long lines), twisted colossus, full throttle, Goliath and Tatsu. We found the park very clean and organized. It's not necessary to rent lockers on every attraction, so make sure you don't waste your money on that. There are plenty of restrooms and drinking fountains as well as places to eat, which is very convenient. The stores have great things specially for DC comics fans.",Diana B
50,Everyone had a great time during the Holidays and special menu including VEGAN,We went during the Christmas Holidays and the park was beautifully decorated for the holidays! The teens enjoyed riding the fast thrill rides while the adults loved seeing the park and riding the slower rides!!! The park had special food for sale for the Holiday season which was a nice surprice. They had a contained fire that you could make smores that was fun. The vegan in our group loved the meatless chicken tenders and fries!!! I understand that they have a special menu for allergies and vegans so check at guest services.,Paula O

50,A Super Hero Day In The Rain,"My family and some friends came to the park Sunday January 31st. We have been coming here for years and thoroughly enjoy the rides, attractions, and friendly staff. We don't get together as often as we once used to so we try to make the best of every outing. With rain in the forecast our group still agreed on taking a trip to Magic Mountain for my sisters birthday. We knew that ride closures were going to be happening so we adjusted our expectations accordingly. The day of our trip the rain showed up as forecasted and kept the park from being fully operational. It didn't matter as long as we all were there spending time together. We spent about half a day riding what rides we could and enjoyed each other's company. But what impressed us the most about our visit in the incliment weather was the attitude and helpfulness of the employees. One stood out the most to us, the young lady who portrays Wonder Woman. She took pictures with us and was so great with the kids. Not just in our party but with all of them. With minimal rides open at one point there was a good crowd waiting for a picture. With winds picking upand the rain misting, she didn't waiver for a minute. Kneeling down she would interact with the kids at their level and strike a pose. We joked with her about getting rained on and she didn't complain for a second. Im sure there are multiple people portraying Wonder Woman for the park, but this individual was the only one we saw during our visit (1/31/16). So hopefully she gets credit and knows she made our groups day. Thanks Six Flags, and thanks Wonder Woman for taking care of us on a rainy day visit. We'll see you next time!",themachine306
50,Excellent rollercoaster park,Had a great at this park. We could have bought cheaper tickets online but the park can close if the weather is bad so we opted to pay on the day. Not the easiest place to get to on public transport so we used Uber to and from our hotel,Scott B
10,Avoid green lantern,"Not much to say about six flags, great coasters in a park that's never packed. My last trip was a little rocky though: rode green lantern and while in line the ride broke down 3 times. Finally got on and the ride is extremely painful and jumpy, and when we were done our car failed to make it up the return track and we got stuck upside down for about a half hour, the whole time the bicycle style seats forced into my and my girlfriends crotches in a way so painful we were taken to the first aid building afterwards. When we arrived there the employee working treated us like we were garbage, and lying about being hurt. I get that people may pull this stuff, but when you are escorted in a wheelchair from a ride you'd think they would be a little more friendly. I ended up losing it about the point that the employee stated that my girlfriend was lying about her groin being injured ""probably to get free tickets"" and tore into him until a park manager arrived. We were given ticket refunds, and free tickets which we will not be using. Go to Knotts, they value you as a customer.",James D
50,The best roller coasters ever,"Magic Mountain has the greatest roller coasters ever! We loved X2, Goliath, Drop of Doom, Tatsu, and many others. Ate several meals at the park and although a bit pricey thought the food was good. We like this park the most out of all of the different ones we have been to. If you like roller coasters, this is the place to go!",Gabriel002
50,Awesome!,"The best theme park I have ever been too! The roller coasters were out of this world! I defiantly recommend the Twisted Collosus and X2! The longest I lined up was 15 minutes. Staff were enthusiastic and fun! Food could of been a little more fresh but apart from that, it was awesome! A must do!",Hayden R
50,Awesome ! Platinum Tier Flash Pass MUST MUST MUST ! No Lines with Platinum Pass !,"We went this January on a holiday. we were expecting that the park be full full. And it was. Before our arrival we upgraded everything via internet and bought the valet parking, flash pass: platinum tier , and the regular admission tickets. in total it was about $400 something for the 2 of us. Yes, it is expensive. HOWEVER, it is well worth it, including the valet parking, which is right at the entrance. Since we upgraded the parking and bought the platinum flash pass, let met divide this in two:Valet parking:i bought it online a few weeks before our arrival. it was $35. the valet is right at the entrance and no need to take a trolley or park far far far away from the park. this also saves a lot of time. when we left the park at about 5:30 pm, we just picked our car right at the entrance. very easy breezy.Flash Pass Platinum Tier:This pass is expensive yes. worth it? DEFINITELY ! We got at the park at about 10:00 am and the only line we did was at the entrance waiting for the park to open. Once opened, we went right to the Flash Pass office and they hooked us up with the flash pass. It is very easy to use. the platinum is the best of the 3 flash passes offered. we always reserved our ride at the entrance of each ride. NO WAITING IN LINE. all the rides had a 45-2 hr wait. We did not wait at all. With this pass you actually get to go on ALL the rides while walking the park without running to the rides (yes, a lot of people went running to the rides once the gates were opened). You get to do everything at your own pace with no rushing. Definitely suggest you get the platinum flash pass and enjoy all the rides ! We did have to pay $15 extra for the X2 and another ride (don't remember) and the platinum actually includes some rides that the other flash pass don't (some of the BIG rides). this is why i also suggest getting platinum.At the end of the day we decided to eat outside of the park and enjoy good food at a restaurant.Do yourself a favor and make it easy for the entire family, upgrade everything if you can !",VeronicaTrias
40,Return visit 20+ years,Our group had a great time enjoying the rides at Magic Mountain. Crowds seemed more family friendly than the last time we went 20+ years ago. The food was OUTRAGEOUSLY priced for the barely okay burger . Burger patty was below average and the wilted tiny piece of lettuce was pathetic. But I was hungry and ate it.,Rani S
50,Fun filled day of coaster riding,"Highly recommend X2, Tatsu and Twisted Collosus (at night if you can). We went on every Maximum thrill ride except for Green Lantern as it was closed. All were good, though if I get the pleasure to visit again, I will skip Viper and Apocalypse. Too rough a ride for me. I'm terrified of Rollercoaster, but I force myself to try. X2, Tatsu, Batman and Collosus wer all pretty smooth. This 30-something is beat after spending all day there. The turtle sundae funnel cake was enough for 2 having skipped lunch. Such a great fun day!",Stephanie P
50,Roller coasters,This amusement park has the best roller coasters. If you are a thrill seeker I would recommend these roller coasters. I also love how they have things for small children as well.,Peyton M
50,Great Rides!!!!! Amazing Time!!!!!!!,"I went yesterday for the first time in over 20 years and took my two teenage sons and one of their friends. We had an amazing time. The park was not crowded and the rides were epic. A couple of pointers:1. Yes, parking was 20 dollars, but it didn't seem to be that expensive since the ride tickets were 51.99 (preordered online 5 days in advance).2. No, the food wasn't as expensive as I read. We had a sandwich by twisted colossus that filled all four of us up, with chips and drinks for 43.99 including tax.3. The longest line was an hour...Full Throttle. They had a sign stating that they apologized that they were running with only one train because the other one was in maintenance. All other rides were about 0 (Viper) to 20 minutes (Tatsu). We actually paused to catch our breaths by going on a couple of rides like the Scrambler. I was glad that I didn't purchase the flash pass, and most people didn't use one (I rarely saw a person go in the entrance of it). The park was empty though.4. The can't miss rides are X2 and Twisted Colossus. In all fairness, I did everything besides Goliath because it broke down a couple of times while I was in the area. X2 feels like the best ride of all time and Twisted Colossus feels like the funnest ride of all time...both different...both musts.5. Apocalypse was amazing as well. It wasn't as good as both of those two and is way in the back; however, it felt like the fastest ride there. It didn't need a huge drop...just pure, unadulterated speed. The wooden coasters always feel faster.5. The bathrooms were dirty...no worse than Knott's though. Nothing will touch Disney as far as cleanliness; however, their ticket is far more expensive.6. There were no shows to go to, maybe because it is in the offseason. None of the water rides were on also.We all had an amazing time. It won't be 20 years until I visit again, that's for sure. We were already planning our return.",lovetodive355
50,Outstanding,We are really into amusement parks and this one is top of the line. It is a busy place yet the wait times are minimal. The Superhero area is so well done and so much fun the kid could not get enough of it and neither could we! Cannot rave about Six Flags enough,Melodee E
50,Coaster Capital of the World,"If you love roller coasters, this is the place to go. Many new attractions and they have fixed some old ones. They have made a great upgrade to their food service. Lots of food choices, and many healthy ones. If you haven't rode Twisted Colossus... hurry up and go, best ride ever. They are upgrading Revolution at the moment. They have Bugs Bunny world for the little kids. So Magic Mountain has fun for the entire family.",Swishy68
50,All day Roller Coasters!!!,"Few things to know, if you buy online tickets are $62 instead of $77. Also if you are going for more than one day, season's passes are cheaper than 2 day tripper tickets. Even though we went all day, we just managed to go on all the extreme and moderate rides in one day, could definitely do more than one day. There is no outside food/drink except water bottles. If you arrive at opening, head to the back of the park to get to the rides with the shortest line up first as everyone seemed to go straight for the newest coaster (full throttle). Tatsui and X2 are definitely the scariest ones due to hanging upside down, sense of free fall and spinning aspects. If you love coasters - six flags trumps disney any day - and way cheaper. Height requirements are on the app, range from 48""-54"" but there are tamer rides for younger kids.",TheCanadianGirl
50,Go there!!!!,"Yes, yes, and yes, go there if you are a roller coaster enthusiast. This park has 18 of them and every one is different in some way. We went here 18th of January, it was a Monday and not that crowded. But we still got ourselves the flash pass, the gold version which is 50 % off que time, and it was so worth it, at least for us that only going to be here once in our lifetime. We were able to do the most rides twice and it's very nice to not have to stand in line the whole day. So go there, buy yourself a flashpass and just ride those amazing roller coasters :) X2 was the best!",Hillihappo
50,"Day-trippers – get a Flash Pass, one of the best investments you'll ever make","If you want to ride some of the world's fastest and highest rollercoasters, then this is the place for you. Forget about all that mouse crap at Disneyland...this place is purely for adrenaline junkies, with none of the distractions.First thing first, if you're visiting California from out of state or from abroad, then definitely get a Flash Pass. It's the best money you'll ever spend in terms of the returns you get for your $. A Flash Pass allows you to skip the standard queues, and go in via the Flash Pass entrance to each ride, where the queue is either tiny or non-existent. This means that instead of wasting around 1 hour queuing for some of the park's most popular rides, you just waltz in and hop on.Further bonuses with the Flash Pass – you can stay on in your seats for seconds...or even thirds! And you're given a little handset that allows you to book your queue-less spot on each ride.We spent 7 hours at Magic Mountain and using the Flash Pass did all the extreme and middle rides, some several times over. That's over 20 rides all together. I had a headache from my own screams. It was awesome. (The only ride the Flash Pass doesn't cover is the X2 ride...for which you have to pay $15pp separately in order to avoid queueing. We didn't bother in the end).There are several 'levels' of Flash Pass, depending on how little you want to wait and how much you're prepared to pay for it. We were there for the day and went full-out (approx. $110pp) but it was completely worth it.Food-wise, it's the usual theme park fare, so in order to avoid eating overpriced deep-fried crap (unless you want to), we loaded up on mega-breakfasts at the IHOP about 1.5 hours before getting there (you don't want to shake all that food around just after eating it) and frankly weren't even remotely hungry until we left 7 hours later.This place is a must.",gulya_ldn
50,First west coast amusement park,"Just moved here from the east coast. Frequented Cedar Point, Williamsburg, Six Flags Great Adventure in NJ, and many others. Nice selection & variety of rides. We went on January 4th and the were NO LINES! Definitely made the visit better as we could sample all the rides in one day. Would go back during peak season now that we know which coasters we want to ride again. Food was expectedly expensive but above average for Park food.",StuStuff
50,"Awesome rides, awesome experience!","As a family of two adults and two teens/tweens, this park was very suitable for us. After planning going here for a while we finally made it, and had a fantastic time. I knew about every rollercoaster, where each one was, and about the flash pass, which really helped make sure we used the time we had wisely. (All of this can be found on there website). Once we got in the park, straight away we went to get the platinum flash pass. There are three levels for the flash pass; regular, gold and platinum. The platinum reduces waiting time by 90%, the gold by 50%, and the regular just reserves your place in line with no reduction of wait time. Even though the platinum was pricey, so worth it, and if you are going to this park for one day and want to ride every coaster at least once, you must get the platinum flash pass. We didn't have to wait in line AT ALL FOR THE WHOLE DAY. We went on a ride, then straight away after we got off, booked the next ride. By the time it takes you to get to the next ride the wait is over, so you just get straight on.In terms of the rides, they were all brilliant. twisted colossus was by far the best, then Full Throttle and Tatsu.In my opinion, here is the order of the rides from best to worst:Twisted colossusFull ThrottleTatsuSuperman escape from kryptonGoliathThe riddler's revengeScreamBatman: the rideAppocalypseGreen lanternRevolutionninjagoldrusherviper.Don't get me wrong, none of these rides were bad, they were all amazing except Viper. Though Viper may look OK, it is so rough, the whole time my head was banging.X2 isn't on the list because we didn't ride it because it looked a bit too out there for us.I would definitely recommend coming to this theme park, and i would certainly come here again. Now I know why it's one of the best parks in the world.",Nick D
50,THRILLING!!,"This is the best rollercoaster park I've ever been to. We are Australian and were there in winter which meant no lines which was great. There are so many rollercoasters and they are bigger and more thrilling than ones I've done before. Much more thrilling than Knotts Berry. Don't bother going if you don't like rollercoasters as you won't enjoy yourself-there was nothing my father could go on at all. If you want a scare and a thrill then this place really delivers. They don't allow any food or drink in so don't bother taking any. Selfie sticks and large lenses etc weren't allowed in either so it is good to check before you go if unsure. Many lost stuff they didn't want to-we went on a bus and there were no lockers outside so things were tossed. I would imagine it would be busy in other seasons judging from the many lanes to get in to each ride. I have some trouble walking and there was a lot of walking even with no lines of people. Many rides had stairs to get to the rides too.On The Riddler's Revenge you stand up while riding (there is a bicycle type seat there but you are standing). There were a few rides that weren't rollercoasters such as the Drop of Doom, Swinging seats etc. We did not do any water rides as it was Winter. Best rollercoasters I've done.",Petrina D
50,Amazing roller coaster,"Magic mountain is awesome! The park is huge and splits the rides into 4 classes based on how 'intense' they are. The most exciting ones are great with big drops, fast speeds and lots of turns. My favourites were Tatsu, X-2, Twisted Colossus and Goliath (special mention to Apocalypse which looked pretty underwhelming but turned out to be loads of fun). Only downsides about the park are the queues (inevitable) and parking ($20 per car). My recommendation for getting the most out of the park is to arrive real early when they open and go anticlockwise on the map. X-2 is usually the most crowded so if you give it a miss you may only have to wait less than 30 mins for most rides.",ss-hao
50,Great time!,"I hadn't been to Six Flags for about 10 years. We all had a blast, the rides are amazing and the park is not too big. Make sure to ride the Must-ride first so that you don't miss any of them. For sure Twisted Colossus, Tatsu and X2.",aleindal
50,excellent value,Best value for any theme park in Califorina. There line up are short so you can go on so many more rides and its not 200.00 dollars to get in.,534lawrencew
40,Magic Mountain,I enjoyed the rides. The park felt more small town amusement park instead of a corporate money pit. The lights at night were wonderful.,Delana R
40,Exhaustingly Fun!,Six flags has changed how they are doing their lines to make a bit more sense. Not micromanaging so much anymore. I had a season pass while living in Arizona to this six flags because I would drive here on weekends with my husband. We LOVE amusement parks and we now live 4 minutes from the gate here in Santa Clarita. We love the rides. Can't wait for Revolution to be ready this year!,MrsNessaPierce
40,Thrill Rides Galore!!,Some of the coasters are insane here!!!!Shout out to Tatsu it scarred me for life it flips you round and you are face down hundreds of feet up v v scary!! then your on your back.Park was empty when we went as it was off season during the week which was great however we got stuck on a roller coaster Tatsu upside down for 30 mins (at the end of it thank god so close to where you get off but was still pretty scary after that I was scared to ride other rides!,COD_and_BEX
40,Fun place to go!,"Go as early as possible and take protein bars and water with you. Make use of the lockers when necessary and stay away from too ,much sugary foods. Take sandwiches with you and keep them in your car in a cooler and walk out to eat. The prices for food and drink are ridiculous!",Spinner48
40,Fast and furious,"Having never visited a six flags theme park before, it is one of the cheaper theme parks in LA. The rides are very white knuckle compared to the uk and the rides we went on only had waist leg harness and not shoulder. We where there for 6 hours and only got on 2?rides, the amount of people was crazy even waited an hour for pizza. I enjoyed the rides I went on but would of liked to have gone on more and the drinks and food is really expensive. You can't take in your own food or selfie sticks.",monkey2009Cheshire
40,Good for older children,"Visited the park the day after Christmas. The crowds were large but manageable. Good park for older children, although my 5 year old did like the water ride. The mid-way can be expensive on top of your entry tickets as each game is $1 or more. Food was ok. Frozen lemonade was good. Parking is far from gate and take a picture of where you are parked as its hard to find int he dark.",808_DeniseL
40,wild rides,"I personally feel that you need more than a day for this theme park and to go on the off season and to get the fast track pass for all the rides, as we were only able to do four of the rides due to the seriously ridiculously long waiting period as some of the rides the wait time was over two hours and most of the lines had no shade whatsoever, however what we got to do was extremely fun and there are loads of food outlets, drink stations and public facilities, also if you go on the log ride prepared to get drenched",Rachel W
10,Terrible!,"While it may have the most coasters, it certainly is a terrible park. Most of the coasters were broken. The park was full of trash. There were a lot of gangs. The park smelled bad. The food was inedible. Avoid this park at all costs, go to Disneyland/Disney California Adventure to see good theme parks.",aimeen469
50,Rides are unbeatable! Service excellent too!,"We thoroughly enjoyed our visit. We drove down from San Jose area for New Years and had wonderful family trip, though we wish they stayed open past 8pm.",Susi S
50,"Suck it Walt, I found my happiest place on earth!","Absolutely amazing park for those seeking a real adrenaline rush! (That kind of comes with the territory when you're the park with the most rollercoasters in the entire world I imagine)Scored a season pass for $75, half what it will cost you to get into Disney for a single day; such great value!Unfortunately our day got rained out halfway through, like I needed more of an excuse to return the next time I'm in LA!As always with these sorts of places the food was expensive and the toilets neglected, but given whats waiting for you its not a big deal at all.All up an excellent day out, start the day with X2 (which was unlike anything I have ever experienced before) and you're in for a real treat!",M0tch
40,Big Bad Rollercoasters,Best coaster park in the west.Twisted Colossus and Full Throttle are absolutely amazing! Tatsu is still the biggest thrill in the park for me. X2 and Scream were closed all day due to winds. Going on a winter weekday is best for minimal crowds. Bathrooms are disgusting.,htwheels
50,Family,We love love love going!!!!! We have a lot of fun is the best family fun. If you become a member it so well worth the price. We love it!!!!!,love1031
50,Excellent for pumping Adrenaline,"We were a group of 5 and 2 of us decided to retire after the 3rd ride :)It was the largest roller coaster field I have been to and we enjoyed a lot.X2 , Tatsu and Full Throttle became our favorites for thrill seekers like us. Do not bother with the queues ; it is definetely worth it.",YucelOzacar
40,Six Flags,"Great place, kids had a blast. Only negative was that the waiting times posted outside each ride were way off. Busy time, and it was quite frustrating not really knowing how long the line would take when you wanted to get round as many rides as you could",Bridget T
40,We loved IT!,"We were there on Jan 1st (don't go on Dec-Jan), the lines were at least a 40 minute wait... They were TOTALLY worth it tho... The food was ok and the restrooms need to be re-modeled ASAP!",Elvia M
50,Christmas in the park,"Took the family to Christmas in the park... Had a great time we took so many pictures at the picture stations set up in the park and the best part is .... Wait for it.... We Are Not Broke after our visit!!!!!! I did not have to take a second mortgage out on the house lol (Mickey). But seriously, we had a great time. Can't wait till next year, we will be baaaaaack 😜",tessadbonmanb
50,Super fun place!!,"Six Flags Magic Mountain is well worth the 30-45 drive from L.A. Plan on getting there right when the park opens for the shortest ride times. We got there right at opening and had no problems getting on the rides we liked. To save time map out which rides you want to do and get them done first. In the afternoon the lines get long. Some rides offer single rider lines. That helps if you are by yourself or don't mind splitting up from your group. There is a cool kids section. So, all ages will have fun.",Korndog Izard
10,Way way way too long of lines,"As non-locals it did not make sense for us to buy season tickets or the extra 110.00 for Express Pass. We arrived slightly before opening and left at 7pm. In that entire time we rode THREE, yes three rides! Between insane crowds, rides breaking down, and rides riding half-empty; it was a total waste of a day and cost of tickets. The 3 rides we rode were very fun. We will never be back.",sharonped
30,The season pass price is hard to resist!,"We have been with and without children and both times we've had a lot of fun. The park staff seem very friendly but the park itself seems a little run down. The roller coasters, particularly the X2, the Tatsu and the Goliath are absolutely amazing! The only big complaint I have so far is that they have signs everywhere saying that if you cut in line you will have to leave but that was not enforced at all and we experienced quite a bit of it, even in the kiddie park.We bought the season pass and plan to use it often!",SunnygirlC
40,Six Flags Magic Mountain has something for everyone even in the Winter,"Six Flags Magic Mountain is a great place to visit for the entire family. My family & I visited 12-27 to 12-28-15 and the Park is decked out for the Holidays until 1-3-16. All the rides were running except for the water rides. There are Holiday events at the Park all thru the day and at night there is a light show and entertainment throughout the Park. It is not cheap so you are better off buying a season pass that includes parking. The pass we purchased is good thru 1-23-17. Food is very expensive there and you can not bring in coolers with food or drinks. However, we were there for 2 days and the entire family really enjoyed themselves.",juliepsheridan
50,How is it possible?,"I absolutely loved this theme park! It was soo much fun and I have never experienced so many roller coasters in one spot. One day was not enough, I wish I had two days! X2 was the BEST!",Eline387
20,"Mixed, but mostly bad","It was a huge wait to just go through the metal detector. We moved to another side and for some reason that went a lot faster. Before that we had hardly moved in an hour. Then another line to actually get in and then huge lines at the best rides at the park. Some didn't tell you the wait time and others were way off. There were good things about the park, but they really get dwarfed by the negatives. During Christmas, when we went, the park was lit up nicely at night. I think they must be living off their name to attract customers, but not with much repeat business.",Jim L
50,Great family fun,Fun place. Lots to do. Great place to bring the kids. Many places to eat and drink. They serve alcohol for the adults and hot chocolate for the kids. Worth every penny.,joker198618
50,X2,"Although our trip to the park was met with rain it was still a great experience. Must rides are definitely X2, Tatsu, Batman, and Goliath.",Raphael Bernard... S
50,Great Christmas Experience,This was our 3rd visit to the park on Christmas Eve and it has now become a tradition with us. The park is beautifully decorated and it gives the kids a chance to get out of the house and let off some energy before Christmas Night and Christmas Day. It wasn't very crowded and we didn't have to wait long to get on the rides. The staff is always excellent and its a great way to continue being in the holiday spirit.,Carl B
30,It's NOT Disney or even Universal,"While the park is trying, and they are trying hard, the staff and the cleanliness of the park are the biggest issues. The staff are rude, short and don't seem to really want to be there. I suppose that is what you get when the kids who are so called managers are doing the hiring of well other kids. There's no enthusiasm to be at work and theres no appreciation. All the bathrooms smell like urine, so you might as well be using a portapotty. If you are seeking thrill rides then this is your place? If you are planning to eat in the park, don't; like with most theme parks the price doesn't not meet the expectation nor the quality. This park is a prime example. Do however, get the souvenir cup as it comes with extremely cheap refills. Wear commutable shoes, the hills in the park (going from lower level of park to upper level) are killer but your calves will thank you if you are of the athletic sort. Plan out your day as the lines for the newer rides are torturous, to get the full fill of the park get there first thing, unlike Disney that has extended hours during summer time this park does not. Closing time is the same and you will wait in line. If you have a Discover card, the park does have featured Discover rides where you and your party get front of the line which is pretty cool. Currently the park is done up for the holidays, similar to Disney and Universal as well as Knott's. The park gets cold at night at hot during the day. There are no heat lamps and no misters so plan accordingly based on season.",DS9MW
40,Great roller coasters,We like to visit amusement parks with roller coasters and magic mountain has a great selection.My wife's favorites are Apocalypse and the Superman ride.The park is quite large and the grounds are well kept. Plenty of food options.We enjoyed our day there.,ct-cruisers
20,They do not accommodate anything,"Came with a group of 6 and had an issue with some of the rides not being able to fit a 6'3"" guest. Supposedly it is specified on their site which rides height requirements but we went to guest relations and they were not willing to refund or compensate just to make our friends stay a little better. We dealt with such rude ride attendants and SLOW SLOW SLOW FOOD SERVICE. The station that serves specialty fries took 45 minutes for 1 order. The sports bar is a ripe off!! DO NOT order the sampler platter. Literally looks like left overs and taste old. The rides of course are awesome but everything else just cancelled out the enjoyment of everything.",Tinetina77
50,Roller Coaster Heaven,I didn't go on a single ride but my husband and grand-daughter hit them all. The staff members are very nice and help you find your way to the next ride. Look for the Full Throttle Sports Bar. The food was good and it was inside!,PKWTraveler
40,First visit,"We usually go to Discovery Kingdom in Vallejo, CA with our Six Flags passes but we decided to take a road trip with friends for Winter Break. Very glad we did. It's a way better park than Discovery Kingdom. Great time of year to go as the ride lines are not bad. Overall a fun visit. We'll be back.",Amanda S
20,Hmmm - a lot to be desired,"We went on a day when it wasn't busy - all the coasters were amazing (except the Apocalypse, the wooden one, very happy to hop off that one at the end) - cues were pretty short. HOWEVER staff were generally in no hurry and slow moving. I got the impression that no one gave a dam about anything. Toilets were revolting, and food was overpriced and average.",TimberNZ
50,Family Fun!,"Went to Magic Mtn with family (3 adults and 3 children ages 8-12). Lots of thrill rides rated ""moderate"" and ""maximum"". Most maximum thrill rides required a minimum height of 54"". Some of the others required a 48"" minimum height. Super fun if you like high speed roller coasters. Separate area for younger kids with smaller roller coasters and younger kid rides. Game arcades to win prizes, super heroes walking the park and a separate water park too (we didn't go cuz it was cold). It's definitely an entire day or more of fun.",Kyle K
50,Amazing experience!,"It was a blast being here! Rode almost all of the main rides they got and since then I think my standard on riding extreme rides went up exponentially. All kinds of roller coasters they got: standing, sitting, hanged, you name it! X-2 was the most thrilling though. Five thumbs up! HAHA!",Michael O
50,best place on earth,"Magic mountain has the best rides and and friendliest staff I live this place wish I could live there lol. I truly recommend this place to people of all ages. Once your there full throttle, goliath, x2, scream, and drop of doom are a must .",jayadam1026
40,Great place for Birthday partys,"We took our family for our Grand daughters birthday party and she had a blast, it was nice being there at Christmas time",Randy C
50,Amazing thrill park,"Six Flags Magic Mountain is THE go-to thrill park. Sure they have tamer coasters with no loops like Ninja or Apocalypse, but you will not find a park with better thrill rides for hundreds of miles around.X2 is insane, even for a coaster veteran. This ride alone justifies admission. Then you have Superman, which is extremely thrilling. Goliath, even without loops, has an insane drop, and insane speed. Scream, Viper, Tatsu, Batman, and Riddler's Revenge are also high thrills.No other park in Southern California can hold a candle to Magic Mountain. Everybody down here already knows it, but if you're from out of state looking for thrills, this is your go-to spot.They also have tamer stuff, like I said. Revolution is a good starter coaster for people trying to build up to the big dogs, Ninja is exciting but not too intense, same with Apocalypse. They have plenty for people who like their rides exciting but not too intense.Magic Mountain is really good.",Dillon J
40,Good,"Was a rainy day, 5 min or less the waiting time.The bad thing, some rides was closed for the rain.The X2 it's crazy, and the classics ride awesome.",Israelml90
50,Awesome family fun!!!,"I have always loved Magic mountain since I was a kid, & I love it even more now that I have my own kids to take. We all have membership season passes & we go almost every weekend. The rides are super fun, & there are plenty of things to do for the non riders in my family. The food prices are a bit expensive, but having purchased a membership dining pass, I can enjoy more of the food when I go. I think Magic mountain's concern for guest safety & happiness at their park makes me enjoy going even more...",tiffany7457
50,Lots of fun if you have teenagers!,I went with the high school girls hockey team I was supervising. 15 teenage girls with 4 adult supervisors. Two of the supervisors rode just as many coasters as the girls did. I walked around with the other supervisor and only hit the newest wood and steel coaster. It was a great ride for someone looking to push themselves a little without having a full heart attack! Lol we also stopped in at the sports bar and had a drink and snack. We also tried the funnel cake with a much needed coffee. That was awesome! The girls really enjoyed their day and talked about it non-stop. We were also lucky to be there with all the Christmas decorations and displays up. Added a little magic to the day!,Turbomomof2
30,for big kids,I was disappointed with this place. There were so many rides that went upside down that we were feeling quite sick or didn't want to go on them because of that. Also my 6 year old only had a few rides he could go on as he was not tall enough.,Chelledavies75
50,Awesome Holiday Park Theme,The holiday in the park lights and overall theme was great here. The way it was lite up at night was beautiful and the snow area by the roaring rapids was awesome it really gave the winter feel with all the Christmas decorations.,chereamor1904
50,Great Fun,"I've been going to Magic Mountain since I was a kid. It may not be as good as it once was, but it's an awesome day of roller coasters and fairgrounds food.",KamranNezami
50,Great family fun,My six year old great nephew enjoyed himself in bugs bunny land as much as his 14 year old brother and the adults did.,Sandi A
30,"I love amusement parks, just not this one","We have a membership with Magic Mountain, and I have to say it's just not my favorite park, we go just to pass time and take our guest who visits us there. The food is over priced and for it not to taste decent is a problem for me. We went today because my brother visited from chicago, of which he has a pass also, and he was not pressed either.",La Shawn B
40,🎡🎢,"Awesome, but long waiting time. Three roller coaster went to the time five hours 😁 and difficul to get a gluten-free food. Still, insane place! 💪🏼💪🏼",163mah
40,Our teenage boys loved it!,"We visited with our sons today and when I asked them how they would rate the day, they gave it 5 out of 5. They went on all the most challenging rides and did this easily in 4 hours (being winter) and had no problem with qeues. The only negatives they reported were sore necks and shoulders from the jerking motions of the Green Lantern ride and the not so flash toilets.From our perspective, my wife isn't so keen on rollet coasters, but there were enough rides at the level she likes. The food was far too expensive and we also thoughg the toilets were lacking. The music was played far too loudly in parts of the park - to the extent that we couldn't hear the safety advisory on two of our rides.All up though - a great day and one that our sons especially will remember.",Gavin H
30,Awesome!,"The roller coasters were so much fun! However 3 were closed due to high winds, and one for construction. Twisted colossal was the best one. I gave the park 3 stars because the staff was not very organized. The line wait was an average of 45 minutes, and they would send the coaster carts with empty seats instead of filling them. That only made the wait longer. But overall had fun, would definitely go back.",rdzone9162003
10,Last visit!,"We are roller coaster maniacs and love a good time and full day of running through the parks we visit. Magic Mountain has become worse and worse over the past 10 years. This is my 5th visit and MY LAST!I have been bragging about this park just for the amount of rides to experience. One of us has never been here so I wanted to bring him along to ride coasters unlike no other. Twisted Colossus, Green Lantern, Tatsu, Apocalypse, X2, and Full Throttle. Twisted Colossus, Apocalypse and Tatsu are the only rides worth talking about.First we had to process our season pass outside the front gate with no direction. The young man in the window failed to share the processing center was outside the gate. When we got to the ticket entrance, we were told we could not come on until we process our pass. That's fine, but give some direction or train the employees how to take care of guests needs. When purchasing our pass, we noticed a sign that had 4 attractions that were not going to operate for the day. But, low and behold, there were 5! X2 was down the entire day. Again, fine! Tell your customers what is really going on before good money is spent! That was the one unique ride we came for. We stood in line for Full Throttle and did not move for 30 minutes. That was the common theme over the day. Every line was terrible. Not long! Just slow slow slow! The staff has no sense of urgency at any of the boarding stations. And why is there line control...every ride had a stop place where an employee would hold people back carrying a huge gap! The crew at Goliath was the absolute worst! Jennifer at the Ninja was awesome and very nice, once it opened at the end of the day.The restrooms are disgusting and need to be cleaned more often. It was clearly evident that no one took care of them most of the day.Six Flags! Remove your signs about ejecting people from the park for line jumping since it obviously doesn't apply. We have never seen so much cutting in line as we did today. No one around anywhere to regulate that.Cedar Fair amusement parks are second to none! Six Flags could learn a thing or two! Cedar Point is the king of all parks! First and foremost, basic fundamentals of guest service. It is absent on all levels at Magic Mountain. Even the manager figures in the pizza place by Gold Rusher had no regard for what was happening at the service counter.We will return to Illinois to enjoy Great America with our season pass where they at least care about the guest experience.",Henry S
40,Enjoy The Ride,"When you go to a place like six flags specially in the summer try buying the fast pass so you wont have to wait in lines..Really loooonnnng lines! You'll pay around a 100 $ but you'll get to go on almost all rides. If you buy the regular ticket you will be wasting your money on waiting in lines and probably will miss the best rides like Goliath,Superman,..etc. Food is not so good and rest rooms are not that clean. But the rides are fun and gives you that adrenaline rush you need :) One more thing get there early and make sure you stay hydrated ENJOY THE RIDES!",Lamiita
50,My favorite thing to do,I absolutely love going to magic mountain. I visit as often as I can. I love the decorations and the rides.,Edwierdo227
30,Should be called Roller Coaster Mountain,"We visited Magic Mountain for the first time in about 12 years. I won free tickets off of the radio so figured we should use them before they expire. Good thing the entrance fee was free as I would have a hard time paying full price for this place. Bring your wallet because $20 for parking and $12-20 for a locker so you will be short of $40 faster than the roulette table in Vegas.This park has made its money on adding as many roller coasters as possible within the smallest place as possible. There is still a LOT of walking necessary though so bring comfortable shoes. I would try to sneak in some water or something because the costs for food are outrageous. Guess it is the theater mentality that you are a captive audience so let's gouge em as much as possible. Based on the recent financial results for Six Flags Inc (owner of Magic Mountain) I would guess it is working.This used to be a gang hangout and it appears they have removed that element. Quite a few security and undercover police on site. So that is good.Did not ride new Collossus ride (line too long) nor Tatsu Or Full Throttle. Ninja was closed and Revolution is under renovation. Was able to make the rest and reviews below.RidesScream is the best one we rode.Riddlers Revenge is a good ride tooApocolypse is a wood coaster and is a bone jarring ride. If you are pregnant and want to give birth, I recommend this ride as it will shake the baby right out of you!! Seriously though, I would probably skip it.Batman is good but way too short. I could not imagine waiting more than 10 minutes in line to ride this 60 second ride...Goliath - good ride and will definitely cause you to swear on the first drop.Green Lantern- different but not bad.Son was too afraid of Superman but have ridden before. Short but thrilling.As far as everything else, the bathrooms smell, there was no one cleaning up tables diners had left behind at the food places and there was a lack of napkins at some of the eating establishments (guess it is a cost cutting effort).I would not recommend this place for the summer as I am sure it is packed and too hot. The line for Colossus was 45 min during December! I can only imagine how long it would be in the summer.If you are a roller coaster nut and are there just for the thrill rides then you won't be disappointed. Otherwise go during the week during a cooler month when all of the other kids are in school.",Gerritt B
50,Fun!,"We had a great time! Some of the rides and shows were closed, but it is the off season. The lines were not too long, and the rides were thrilling. The employees were friendly and helpful.",Vdiane
40,Not excellent just for the lines,"Very good! They opened a few minutes earlier which was great for us since we were already in line for 40 minutes.The park is very well-maintained, the bathrooms were always clean and the Christmas decoration was outstanding! Good variety of places to eat, too.The only things I did not like were the hills and long walks from one attraction to another, and I think there could be more signs for localization, especially at night.I am very into thrill rides, so I can only mention them. But I could see people all ages having fun.I enjoyed a lot Superman (it lasts less than 15 minutes but it is worth it), Tatsu, the Riddler's Revenge, Batman, Full Throttle and Goliath.I hated Green Lantern and Scream because they would hit my head too much.I enjoyed X2 because it is so different and powerful, but it gave me a headache. It was my brother's favorite!",AnaCAlmeida1
50,Holiday In The Park,Holiday In The Park at Six Flags is awesome...tons of lights. Highly recommended! Definitely put us in the holiday spirit. More christmas lights than other events in the area,dpdp20152015
50,Best park in California hands down!,If you love roller coaster this IS the park to visit. I have been going since I was a child and it how I chose to spend my 40th birthday. I ❤️ Magic Mountain!!! Best to go in winter when there are less people.,Raquel U
50,I love Six Flags Magic Mountain!!!,"Six Flags Magic Mountain is an awesome place to go if you are a thrill seeker. There are some intense rides that will make you scream at the top of your lungs! (in the best way) Plus, if you have a gold season pass, parking is free, and the pass pays for itself in just 2 visits! I've been to Magic Mountain at least 10 times, and it's awesome every single time I go. I know that I will continue to come back time and time again, especially with a new coaster coming out soon!Be sure to wear comfortable shoes (a lot of walking), pack light (you don't want to carry much or have anything get stolen), and don't bring any food or drinks into the park (they have drinking fountains all over the place). You will definitely get your money's worth at Six Flags if you love thrills!",Cassie S
50,So much fun!!,I can not believe what a great deal we got our annual passes for! We really had a blast and the souvenirs were a great deal too!,Flyer588030

30,Brilliant roller coasters.,"My husband and I visited six flags last Sunday. We were staying in las vegas for our honeymoon but we hired a car and being the thrill seekers that we are decided to visit six flags as we love roller coasters.We ordered our tickets onlibe and we decided to order the gold fast pass as we had read reviews that it is quite busy and as we travelled so far we decided we didn't want to miss any of the rides by queuing all day, this was a mistake, the park was not THAT busy and the rides that were busy wernt included in our gold fast track pass, cant help but wonder if all those reviews about the long queues are a ploy to make you buy the gold passes which are really expensive. We decided not to eat at the park as we had spent so much money already.The roller coasters were brilliant. We only had one turn on each rollercoaster as time wasn't really on our side but it was good fun overall.",Natalie L
50,Amazing rides,"If you like thrill rides, this is the place! After riding these rides and seeing the park atmosphere, we actually felt like the money for the tickets was well worth it because these roller coasters are AMAZING! X2, Tatsu, Twisted Collossus, Scream, Batman, Superman, Green Lantern, Apocalypse, Lux Luther! Such adrenaline rushes for all of us from 52 years old to 10! So fun and the food is pretty good too!",Antioquia24
40,"Best Coaster Park, but Room for Improvement","Can't find a better park anywhere if you want roller coasters. There are a lot of good to very good coasters, but none that I'd say are like the top 10 in the world.I spent eight days there in Nov 2015. Here are a few tips:* Get the season pass if you are visiting more than once. The gold and dining pass are a good deal too if visiting three or more times.* Crowd levels fluctuate a lot, but prepare for crowds. During weekend only operation, Sundays are less crowded than Saturdays.* The 10 minute early entry helps a lot with the gold pass. Be at the parking lot an hour before opening, and with the 10 minute early opening and hustle, you can knock off the normally busy X2/Tatsu/Superman, or Goliath/Twisted Colossus in a hurry. Two days at the park ensures you get to ride everything. It can be done in one day if it's a quieter day.* You can generally get more rides in during the first two hours than in the four hours after that. So arrive early.A few gripes:* Need more single rider lines.* Staff needs to try harder to fill the rides. Way too many empty seats when the lines are long. Makes the wait way longer for others. Riders don't understand that filling the trains makes the lines way shorter for others. Disney does a better job with filling the rides and not leaving empty seats.* Ride load times suffer significantly from people stashing their stuff. Need to make the stashing spots a bit more convenient. Or how about a certain train having a stash spot in a different place than the other train? The stashing of stuff significantly adds to the lines.* Badly need a restroom before you go through security. Ridiculous that you have to wait in a long line when getting to the park before you can find a restroom.* Would like to see weekday operations in the off-season. Knott's and Disneyland do it. I'd think Magic Mountain could profit from it, but maybe not, otherwise they'd be doing it.And the positive:* Among the best coaster parks in the world, if not the best.* Park is quite scenic, both in the views of the mountains and the park itself with the landscaping. Sure, there's a lot of walking to get from ride to ride with some good hills, but I like that.* And last but not least, lots of shade in the ride queues! This is really appreciated on hotter days.",Todd F
40,Amazing Time!!,The new colossus ride is great! The park was a little dirty but the staff was friendly and amazing food. The rides were worth going to!,Pete_Nish
40,"Excellent Halloween event, despite crowds","Because I have a gold season pass (purchased when they had a terrific discount in August) I was able to park and get in for nothing. After a long day of driving, a good jaunt around the park is exactly what I needed.The park is now immaculate, cleaner than in the last 30 years I've been there. For Halloween, much of the lights were out, colored flood lights illuminated billowing fog, while zombies roamed the walkways and ride queues. In three hours I was able to ride Twisted Colossus twice and Apocalypse once. Twisted Colossus is now a masterpiece of a hybrid coaster with EJECTOR airtime, and sloooooowwwwww zero G rollovers as if you were in The Matrix. Apocalypse is a very wild wood coaster that shreeks around the track at top speed. Magic Mountain has a very impressive collection of coasters, although as I get older I find the high G ones a bit much.I'm impressed with the turnaround of the park, which for years appeared shabby and neglected despite lots of new rides. Now there's a reason to visit for special events. If you have never visited before, do yourself a favor and get the Platinum Flash Pass to jump to the head of lines, no matter what the cost. This park has extraordinarily long lines, and your visit could be disappointing otherwise.",Jameyfrank
40,Family Visit,"Something for everyone in the family, all ages entertainment..A lot of very good coaster rides.. Plenty of food choices thoughout the park..",David H
50,Great Time!!!!,The park is outstanding!!!! Great rides for all to enjoy!!!! Just wish that they had more buses to take you from their parking lot. It is a very long walk.,fred g
20,Too much time in lines,"Took almost 2 hours just to get into the park. All the lines end up being one big clump of people trying to get through security, no lines. Took 45 minutes to get a lunch which was very poor quality for a very expensive price. Because it too almost 2 hours to get in, kids where about to wet their pants since there is no bathrooms until after you get through security. Took a little over 2 hours to wait for one ride. So disappointed.",JodyH59
40,Went to ride Colossus before they closed it down,"We came to ride Colossus one last time. My sister Shannon was the thrill-seeker, and although I'm alot older now, I rode it in her memory.Last time I was here, both tracks were running. One going fromt-wards the other going backwards.This trip, only one set of tracks running. One of the operators said it had been that way for quite some time.We rode twice, as the line was surprisingly short. Long lines for most of the newer rides, but i came to ride Colossus, so I was very happy.Glad they didn't get rid of the old coaster after all, they have upgraded it, and can't wait to ride that one too.Magic Mountain is a lot of fun. I recommend!",email4saundra1
40,Great rides... Must buy a Flash Pass..,"We visited the park on a Saturday and it was packed we parked really far away, luckily there was a shuttle bus. The park had some pretty amazing rides. So many roller coasters. We purchased a drink bottle for $20 which had free refills which was great. Only issue was if you weren't buying food the only place to have them filled was always crowded. The biggest let down was the wait times for the rides, all around 2.5 - 3hrs long. We only managed to go on 5 or 6 rides all day and we were there over 12hrs. We tried to purchase Flash passes but they were sold out. Once on the rides it was worth the wait. We also paid for Fright Fest tickets and the mazes were great. They were all open really late and they actually extended the park closing time till 2am, which worked for us. We wished it was easier to navigate around the park, not much signage and we kept getting lost. Overall the rides are great the Adeline lovers and Fright Fest was worth the money. Just buy a flash pass, more money but you will go on more rides.",Candice J
20,Over crowded let down.,"We arrived before the place opened and it still took almost an hour to get through the multiple gates(security, ticketing, etc) into the park. When we did finally get in, the line ups were already 45 minutes long. There are way way too few rides for all the people they let in. By the time we were in the park for 40 minutes the lineups were as long as 2 hours for some of the more popular rides. It's ridiculous. And very disappointing.",NicoleT18
50,Great fun for teenagers,The park was clean. Employees were helpful and friendly. Rides were maintained and clean. Season pass deals are very reasonable. Best rollercoasters if you like a thrill!,DucksFan21
20,Should have been a fun time.....,"We got here this morning before the gates opened (10:30am opening time) and had purchased tickets on-line. There was no information on the website or in the receipt information for the tickets that told what we needed to do when we got here so we ended up wasting over an hour in different lines just to get inside. Currently (5 hours after gate opening time) we are in line for our 4th ride. We have not been wasting time and have gone directly from ride to ride. The last ride took us 70 minutes to get on from the point where we passed the ""30 minutes from this point"" sign. After 40 minutes or so they did announce that it was taking so long because they were running the ride with only 1 train. A ~6 min release to release time for a ride that lasts about 90 seconds tells you just how much time the staff was wasting on the reload. I am hopeful that we will manage to ride a 5th ride before they close at 6 tonight. Compared to other Six Flags parks I have been to; I am very disappointed with this experience. This day has been a major waste of money.",Kerry N
20,Over crowded. Short hours. Not happy,We came for the big rides. All the big rides have 2 hour waits. If we rode 3 of them that is all we could do since they close at 6 today. We thought since it was a week day it would be less crowded. Not so much.,Shannon C
50,BEST THRILL EXPERIENCE - TRUE STATEMENT,"My kids loved it and enjoyed every ride... excellent rides for all ages and sizes, tons of fun.. my wife and I felt like teenagers all over again.. perfect experience, find out for yourself and relive the memories, best thrill experience for the entire family including Grandma and Grandpa !!",Edvin A

50,BEST Rollercoasters anywhere!!!,"I love this park! The scenery is beautiful, the staff are not particularly outgoing, but they aren't rude. X2 is the scariest rollercoaster there is, this place needs to be on everyone rollercoaster enthusiast's bucket list. The food is pretty horrible, but it is worth having to eat it just to visit this place. Parking is super high: $25. But it still gets 5 stars just because they have the best rollercoasters anywhere: X2 and Tatsu.",Buttersfly
40,Fun place,We had a great time at Six Flags. It far exceeded my expectations. Lots of shade on a hot day and not huge queues. Staff were friendly and helpful. My grandchildren loved it.,orfer
30,Unorganized,The whole park seemed to be unorganized. The parking was unorganized. The entrance gate was horrible. I don't know why it was so hard to collect tickets and let people in?!!!The lines were all way too long. We rode 3 rides in 5 hours. The rides we did go on were fun but not worth the lines.,Christy D
50,Everyone should be member! It's worth it!!,Fun and laughs for everyone!!!! Just good clean fun!And that is healthy!So Six Flags Magic Mountain is a healthy choice for good health!Fun and laughter adds years to your life!!!,jcw612
40,Surprisingly Awesome Rides!,"I never thought we'd enjoy this theme park, but it's a lot of fun and a theme park with a lot of trees that gives this nice cool shade on a hot day. From the outside looking in, you would be totally intimated with the huge roller coaster rides you see. We visited on October 31, 2015 with the full intention of staying until they start their Freight Fest - just to take a peek. I have my 11yo and 4 yo with me at that time with a couple of friends who also brought their under age kids. We were pleasantly surprised to find rides good enough for young kids with practically no waiting time at all. Well, most people go to six flags for the roller coasters anyway so the lines were long outside the kid zone. We conquered the Goliath and Ninja to start but we'll be back for the rest of the high thrill rides they have. We explored the park until night fall and considering the day we chose to visit - the crowd level was not that bad. However, food is really expensive price range for chicken fingers or hotdogs ranges from $10-$13 and it's not that much- we brought in a lot of bottled water and some knick knacks to help with the snacks a little bit. Oh, and by the way - since we stayed until night fall - we got to witness their fright fest which i must say was a lot of fun! Really scary cool characters you see trying to spook every one - funny thing is - my kids were more like amused than scared. The characters try not to go near any of the kids but they will approach any adult and you can actually get your picture taken with them but you have to be really fast because they have to be in character always - it was fright fest after all. This is a really cool theme park to visit - we opted for a season pass with a lot of upgrades including parking- so it is totally worth visiting it a number of times. One more thing, their funnel cakes are the BEST ever!!!!! You don't go to Six Flags in Valencia and not try their funnel cakes. You just got to try it!",IDM1217
50,DOT,"We own season passes which offers free admission and parking to many Six Flags locations. Obviously the rides. Will thrill the kids and adults. Recently Magic Mountain opened a sports bar. My wife and I love to relax, have a drink and watch the games while the kids run off with their friends. The sports bar is kid friendly, so they are able to come in and check in with us frequently.",David T
20,Not enough ride requirement info,We are both harden theme park visitors. We have rode every ride in Florida at all parks on many occasions so were very excited to be visiting a Six Flags. We queued first for the Goliath only to find the space to sit in the bucket type carriage seat was too cramped and my hubbie could not get the barrier over his knees. Embarrassed we moved onto Full throttle for the same thing to happen. So off to the Green Lantern with a yippee that we got on ok. Great ride. We then queued for Apocalypse to find the same seat problem. By this time we had taken 1 ride in 4 queues taking more than 2 hours. My hubbie is 6 ft - 15 1/2 stone and never had this anywhere before. There was no info about the ride requirements such as a test of the seat before you entered the queue. So fed up by now we went to customer relations who informed us that the majority of the rides involved sitting in one of these small bucket type carriage seats which meant the day was ruined and with a free drink voucher as compensation we left. Could not face any more long queuing just to find a seat problem. Not sure if others have found this and I am sure we would have enjoyed the day had we been able to ride the coasters. We went to the other park in LA with carriage rides with no problems at all.,brit-xpat
50,Awasome roller coasters,"I really enjoy this park! The roller coasters are awasome, you will find different options for all the family. I recommend you to visit.",Ericksite
40,So much fun.,"We were visiting from Dallas and decided to check out Magic Mountain. We only paid for the general admission for both the mazes and the park. I wish we would have got a Flash Pass. The waits for the rides were all really long. They were fun tho! The only ride that was a disappointment was the ninja. We loved X2. All the rides were so outrageous and fun. The waits were just a bit much. There were also lots of people line jumping which stinks.We also stayed at night for the haunted mazes. Those were so much fun but again the waits were pretty long. Then they would put like 20 people in at a time so it was hard to be scared. I would have rather waited a little longer and had less people go in with me.A really cool part was at 7 pm they had this parade... or something... where they released all the actors in their scary costumes and makeup. That was really neat.Overall good experience. Lines were long, food was overpriced and not the best, but that's what you get when you go to an amusement park, right?",Tirzah D
50,Fun time at the park,"All 4 of us had a very nice time at this park. Much to do and see. Plenty of shops and plenty of clean restrooms. Especially important for young kids. Lots of hills so be prepared, but not too tough. Kids loved the rides. Good value for the money.",Traveldork39
20,2 hour wait for each ride,"Probably our own fault but it was the only day we could go during this stay in California was a saturday, although one would think not high season. Had so high expectations with also can be a bad thing. We got to try three rides and we spent almost the entire day in the park. The wait was just not worth it with 120+ minutes lines for each attraction. We tried the Goliath, Batman and Escape from Krypton. They were all nice rides but no ride is worth that amount of wait unfortunately. Even the restaurant we tried had an hour wait, terrible service, overpriced food with didn't taste good. And did I mention there were LOTS of people jumping the lines everywhere. What's up with that, NO it is not okay to pass the people in line because you have friends further ahead. Nobody enjoys standing in line and when you pass the ones you pass will have to stay in line longer. The staff should have people watching this as it happened a lot!!Left the park very disappointed. Would surly be a great experience without the lines (and the food) so will maybe try another six flags another time but then not during weekend!",Tore Sergei Myklebust
50,The best coaster destination in the West!,"Six Flags has done an amazing job of balancing events and crowd control. My coaster buddy and I went just for the rides but it was also Fright Fest. I've been to Fright Fest there before years ago and they have really ""upped their game."" Not only were the effects, music and lighting immersive and entertaining, the ""ghouls"" were very careful to pretty much annoy teenagers and leave the little kids and older adults alone. This made it much more fun ('cuz I'm an older adult!) and watching the surprised teenage girls launch out a scream or too was pretty fun! But best of all are the coasters! The engineers have pretty much eliminated all the neck-jerking, rough riding elements of the coasters and made each ride a lot more like flying. Particularly awesome is the new Twisted Colossus. Did not know what to expect and took our first ride after dark. What a surprise and SO MUCH FUN! Some of the food was surprisingly well-priced- my buddy and I love fish 'n chips and they made it to order for $11 which is like 25% cheaper than in restaurants outside the park. (On the other hand, 1/2 pound order of garlic fries was $10!!) As parks go, this is no Disneyland and there is plenty of deferred maintenance in the paint department and even some abandoned rides not too carefully disguised, but I'd rather have ride safety as the top priority anyway. I wouldn't hesitate to bring my family here but it's not a destination like Disney. Still- WELL worth the trip, especially if you're a coaster maniac like me!",paulsterling
50,Halloween is great a MM!,Upped the anti. Now it's included in our various yearly haunts. Great v rides... as usual. And the mazes and monsters did a pretty good job.,Shannon F
50,Outstanding Roller Coaster Park,"Through the decades Magic Mountain has evolved from a family style theme park into a thrill seekers paradise. The selection of roller coasters is first rate and sure to give even the seasoned rider goosebumps.I do not recommend the park for families with small children as it has very little to offer when compared to Disneyland.One hint - when you first enter the park you can purchase special ""front of the line"" tickets which can save you 2 hours in line per attraction on busy weekends. But you have to get them early as they sell out quickly.",1fastcat
50,Amazing park!!!,"There are many different roller coasters, you can enjoy different ways to ride each one. I recommend it!",Liana C
20,Our experience in Six Flags,"First impression was very bad. We walked like 2Km to reach the park which was ok to start with but the signs are not clear we were following the flow of people. We reached the check point to check our belongings and the surprise was !! They said the selfie stick is not allowed, I said ok i respect that but what are my options? They replied drop it in the car or otherwise WE WILL THROW IT AWAY! A theme park that size can't afford to keep some lockers for their customers! So i replied throw it away and i saw that she didn't throw it although i asked if i can take it back when i leave she replied no. In addition she was aggressive like i have stolen the stick.Secondly the bathrooms are terrible and so dirty more than public street bathroom as the water is floating from everywhere tissues on the floor , not clean and bad smells.Restaurants are limited and expensive.The staff are only doing their jobs not in the mood to entertain people like what we see in Universal Studios, Busch Gardens and Disney..Finally in general the signs are not clear and walking through the entire park is not comfortable because the walking area is not flat so its kind of hiking at different levels all the time.I personally will not visit the theme park again.",Q8iy
50,Best Value for the MONEY !,"If you love the thrill of roller coasters and the excitement they bring, then Six Flags in Valencia is the place to be. NEVER pay for a day when, for a few more bucks you'll get the whole year of FUN for the family. WE love all the rides, food and things to do at Magic Mountain. Spend a little, Get a lot !!!",Jr R
50,"family trip, magic mountain","we purchase season pass to mm every year. we love the park, and our kids have a lot of fun each and everytime. this park is way much more fun than dizzyland and better value.",kenny440
50,We got to stay in the park for an extra hour!!!!!,"It was a very busy and hot day, long lines like always. I was there 2 years ago and there were a lot of changes and new coasters. First time experiencing the fright fest, very cool decorations scary characters and a cool stage with music. Best of all, around 10 pm they started announcing THE PARK WAS STAYING OPEN FOR AN EXTRA HOUR!! We ended up leaving at 3 am after riding 2 extra coasters and doing a little shopping. Very happy had an awesome day!",Elsa C
50,Best Six Flags yet,"I travel the nation going to Amusement parks. A few months ago, someone stole my wallet which had my season pass in it. My home park is Fiesta Texas in San Antonio, so I was leery of trying to get in the gates or parking without having my card. I was able to print my membership info and we headed to the park. Replacement cards and initial cards have to come from your ""home"" park. I was aggravated at the thought of having to fight about parking or admission. I couldn't get ahold of a live person via phone and I couldn't find my answers online to entrance and parking info. For that I give Six Flags corporate a -1 star! So frustrating.Anyway, they were able to punch my membership number in manually which got us in to park. Then when we got to the gates they directed us over to Will Call, and the procedure was painless. We obtained a day pass for that day after they checked to make sure our memberships were good. It didn't take much time at all and we were good to go! This park is hands down the BEST Six Flags park that I have been to and I'm only missing 4 Six Flags parks out of ALL the parks.ci go for rides, this park had the best rides PERIOD. I asked locals and folks at the hotel which rides to ride first (because I don't like waiting forever later in the day). I rode X2 first at everyone's urging. Hands down, that was the scariest roller coaster I had ever been on. Again, mind you, I travel the nation for amusement parks, that should say a lot! I rode it twice, giggled so hard that I was in tears, and got off the ride both times giggling asking myself ""what just happened"" yes......it's that kind of ride! The 100MPH job was also super fun! The park is clean, the lines move, and ton of rides. The employees are very friendly through the park. I just loved the variety of rides that this park had for the Adrenaline junkie like me!",Jill D
50,You've Got to Go!,Absolutely the best thrill rides. Great fun for the whole family. Be sure to go on twisted colossus as you will not be disappointed. Gold rusher is also a personal favorite. Park is clean and staff are friendly.,418carolynb
50,What an improvement!,"It had been 20 years since I was here last, and this place has really pulled it together. Nice and clean, great friendly staff and a bargain when you think about the pricing at that place down in Anaheim! Even the food is good here.",ralphdufus
50,My favorite theme park so far!!,"The rides are amazing, plenty to do for the little ones as well. The food is great, the employees are friendly, and I recommend this park to anyone who is in need of adventure!",Alyssa P
40,Six Flags Is A Roller Coaster Lovers Dream,"Six Flags Magic Mountain is a rollercoaster lovers dream park... I like the quantity of coasters (19) as much as the quality. The roller coasters are the reason adrenaline junkies flock to this park and the wait times can be long so get the fast pass.We went in october when it was overcast and cooler and it was definitely worth the trip from Orange county. I have been on the X-celerator and other coasters at Knotts Berry Farm and nothing compares to the speed, variety and tecnical superiority of the roller coasters here.This is a roller coaster park for roller coaster junkies and enthusiasts. The food quality and service was fair and although a bit pricey it was not that different than other theme parks that offer more characters and stuff for kids. School was back in session and we didn't mind less kids and more coasters!This Six Flags is arguably the best roller coaster park in the country. I've been to Six Flags Great America in IL, Six Flags over Texas and with 19 roller coasters in total, Six flags Magic Mountain in CA is the best... Although I grew up in IL and visiting the Great America location will always hold a special place.I've riding Six Flags coasters for a few decades now and it's always exciting trying out a new coaster. Drink plenty of water as it gets warm in the summer and don't eat before getting on any of the super coasters! We had a blast on the X2 and the Goliath is still an amazing ride no matter how many times I've ridden...We had a great time at Six Flags Magic Mountain and came prepared early at the opening on a weekday when school was back on and Fall weather has started...I don't recommend weekends and going during the summer when it is way too hot and you can get heatstroke practically... we have gone in the summer too and its just better on overcast days in the fall.... Compared to the other Six Flags parks I've been to over the years this location in Valencia CA was the best experience. I'm looking forward to our next trip to Atlanta which will be our 4th Six Flags park.We had the the Flash Pass and it was on a weekday and not as busy as the last time we went in the summer.... but it was still busy and many people without the flash pass were waiting up to 45 min.We walked right up to practically every ride and didn't have to wait for more than 5 min for any rides. We went on the following coasters: Batman, Tatsu, Full Throttle 1X Goliath, X2, Green Lantern, Riddlers Revenge, Superman, Scream and Viper and that was plenty for one day, especially with us going on some of the rides 2x with the platinum pass!My friend went on Lex Luthor and Revolution too while we sat those rides out to get drinks and relax before leaving. We got there early when the park had just opened and we got all the rides in that we wanted before driving back to our hotel. The weather was great and we had a great time.We always eat before heading to start our day and bring sandwiches and drinks for the parking lot before we go in for a last snack as we know the prices are high on food (about $15-$20 with drinks per person) We basically have a picnic in the parking lot as we have come to expect higher prices on food and drinks at most theme parks anyway...The $125 Platinum fast pass was worth it and we got our tickets discounted thru AAA premiere membership... I have been coming here since I was a kid on vacations to CA and it's always been a thrill ride lovers dream park.5 stars for sheer excitement. 5 stars for value compared to other parks, 4 stars for cleanliness in the park and 3.5 stars for service which was average but adequate. 4 Stars Total.",empowermentor1
50,Good for roller coaster rides,Loved every ride except the green lantern we all ended up with bruises.food really pricey but get the souvenir cup with free refills define try worth it.we didn't bother with the flash pass it wasn't too busy we visited on a Monday.,Brushpuppies
10,"Long lines, poor estimations of wait times, awful service","I've been visiting Magic Mountain every few years since I was a child, whenever I'm in LA. Our family visited on September 19, which you would think would not be a peak period. The first ride we lined up for, the estimated wait time was 45 minutes but it was past 1.5 hours before we got to the front. Just as we were the next up, the ride broke down. Now, I am not so foolish as to insist that a ride be operated if something is amiss, nor do I blame the engineers for not being able to predict how long it will take to fix, but we waited and waited some more, hoping for the best - because the park has no policy of issuing a fast pass to let customers get on the next ride quickly in such circumstances.All other theme parks I've visited around the world want customers to have a happy experience, but it was clear that Six Flags didn't give a toss because they had already collected our cash. With no recourse, we went and lined up at the next ride, which was another 2 hours. All in all, we ended up spending SIX hours in line to ride TWO roller coasters. An incredible waste of time and money. Never again.To add insult to injury, because we bought our tickets online, I've continued to receive marketing email from Six Flags despite repeated attempts to unsubscribe.It's a total shame because I actually *like* their types of rides.",lavernerusso
40,Sunday visit in October,"We pre paid for our car parking online in advance, so when we arrived we just drove up to the attendant who scanned the bar code on the piece of paper and we drove straight in. We arrived in the car park at 10:10, and got parked in the first couple of rows. It was a short walk to the entrance. Again, we skipped the ticket line and instead headed to the metal detector/bag search area. We then waited 15 mins for the main gates to open at 10:30 and our print at home tickets were scanned and we were let in. We didn't bother with the lockers at the front of the park as we didn't want to keep walking back to and from the locker.We were unfamiliar with this park, and so weren't sure of any queue avoiding tactics regarding the big rides. By chance we went on X2 first. There was a 10 minute queue and we overheard a local saying the queue gets big quickly (it's a great ride so this is probably true). At the front of the queue it became apparent there was nowhere to leave belongings during the ride, apart from lockers that cost $1. Alternatively, you could pay $8 and this one payment would allow you to use any of the ride lockers all day. A ride attendant saw me with my $8 and told me to only pay the $1, as on all the other rides there were areas to leave belongings anyway so the $8 locker wasn't worth it. This was a good tip and turned out to be true, also saving valuable ride time not having to keep going to the ride locker first and instead just leaving our bags at the ride station.We gradually worked our way through the endless roller coasters. The majority of the time we waited 15 minutes max to go on a ride. The exception to this was Tatsu, where our wait was an hour due to only one train running.There was a strict no outside food or drink rule. When it came to lunch time we both had burgers and chips costing $12.99 for a double and $9.49 for a single burger, plus $4.79 each for a large coke. It was very hot and when we bought two large 1litre bottles of water later on, this was just over $10 and the same again for 2 frozen Lemonades. The standard of food is very average for what it costs, but this didn't bother us too much as we were here for the rides.The toilets badly need updating and weren't very clean despite it being early in the day. I'd recommend taking a small bottle of anti bacterial hand gel.We'd go again as the rides were incredible, especially X2 which was a 5th dimension roller coaster and easily the best ride there. The map is helpful as it clearly states which rides are extreme thrills, moderate thrills etc. The Halloween theming throughout the park was fun.",Pip-F1
40,Awesome rides!! Grounds are disgusting.,"The bathrooms make you want to vomit they are so filthy. Trashcans are overfilled leaving garbage on the ground. BUT the rides are awesome. Tatsu, Goliath and Batman the ride rock!!",DanaNizAsnatch
30,Not extraordinary,"The park its ok, they haven't really put to much in there the rides are good but do not take anything with you if you are going, they are lockers on the bottom of the rides to put your stuff there, be careful if you are a guy and put your wallet on your back pocket, keep your belongings close to you or leave them at home to be safe if you decide to go",JVDreamBig
40,All about the rides,"Big park with a large number of very good roller coasters for a coaster fanatic. Went for 2 days and enjoyed the rides. However, having visited all but one of the Six Flags parks across the U.S., this park has the WORST line control of any amusement park I have ever been to. There are signs everywhere about line jumping, line saving, etc. BUT IT IS NOT ENFORCED BY THE PARK STAFF! Over and over and over again I witness park employees ignoring and allowing line jumping and saving. All you had to do was say your friends were waiting for you and you would go straight to the front of the line. Infuriating! I even took the time to send correspondence to the park director and never even sent a reply back. I truly believe that they just don't care at this park. Glad I went to experience their coasters, but I highly doubt I would ever go back because of the lack of line control.",Lance P
40,Service,I loved the service on Tatsu and Full Throttle. On some other rides service could have been better but overall it was pretty good.,BlurryfaceDiana
50,Worth it just for Twisted Colossus,"I am a relatively regular Magic Mountain visitor; I visit several times per year. It's always a solid experience and a good time. This time was different.This time was my very first visit since Twisted Colossus and I am just blown away. I don't think I've ever enjoyed a roller coaster that much before. The sheer quantity of air time is a total blast and I'm already looking forward to revisiting just to ride that ride. I would highly recommend going because it has a wide array of coasters to choose from (Tatsu, X2, Superman come to mind as the better ones) and then there's Twisted Colossus. Simply awesome.",eamonwashere
50,Great Park!,Excellent thrill rides. Friendly and helpful staff. The new Twisted Colossus is awesome. Top notch state of the art coasters. If thrill rides are what you want then this park is a must!,JohnnyKeyz
40,Kids loved it!!,"If you love roller coasters, this is the theme park for you!! My kids loved it here! They think it's better than Disneyland!!Only downfall is because we've already been to Disneyland, you can see the difference in the upkeep of the park. Trash on the ground, in the bushes. Leaves everywhere, and yes I understand the leaves fall from trees and can't be helped, but at Disneyland I saw groundskeepers sweeping up all the rubbish, leaves included!!!The park wasn't full as it was off season, but wait times were still rather long. Most of the roller coasters have only one set of cars. So it's not a constant flow of people getting on and off, increasing the wait times.Overall a fun place and would definitely return to bring the kids for a fun day!! Price of tickets are very reasonable!",ijoanne1979
50,short lines,"We went on columbus day and the evening before. The lines were really short. like fast pass without the pass. I would guess this time is out of season, so if you want short lines this is the time",Verlin A
40,"A fairly cheap day out with some incredible rides, and very short queues","I visited in October and was very surprised that the park was so incredibly quiet. The rides here are second to none (certainly compared to the standard of those in the UK) and the queues were minimal at almost every attraction.There were plenty of food outlets selling decent(ish) food at reasonable prices, and there is also a huge water park next door which was a great place to go with the weather still being so hot for the time of year.My favourite two rides were Scream and Riddler's Revenge - both decent B&M rollercoasters with plenty of inversions - Riddler's Revenge has a slightly higher lift hill to begin the ride so the whole thing feels at an even faster pace. In any case, the queues were so short when I went that there was almost no wait at all for most rides, so no need to worry about prioritising on one over another to fit them all in within the day.",thecritic721
40,Family Fun that is STILL Afordable,"Six Flags Magic Mountain has pulled out all stops to entice visitors. They have made their season passes VERY attractive by offering it for the same price as a one day ticket. Then, not to stop there they upgrade you to their Gold Season Pass for FREE. KIck that with the Gold Dining Pass and you end up with more Family Fun than you can imagine at a fraction of the cost of Disneyland for instance. WAY TO GO SIX FLAGS! Looking. Forward to our next Six Flags getaway!",Dean B
50,Best Coasters for SoCal,"If you want some thrills while in SoCal, come straight to Six Flags! They always have deals to save on ticket entry and accommodate all kinds of visitors. They have coasters ranging from extreme to mild. There is something for everyone to enjoy.",sonyap185
50,Best time to go visit Sixflags,Love Sixflags for its extremely rides. We visit early october on a friday no long lines since all college and students are back to school by this time. Was able to even ride any ride twice ... The frightfest was nice. A lot of people dressed up and nicely decorative. 👍🏻👍🏻,Maria Z
10,"It was ""ok""","Things are just ok at this park. All the things you'd expect are in place: over priced food, drinks etc. We live 5 hrs away and it is not worth the time to travel. Park seems dated, dirty and staff are not friendly. If you have not been to an amusement park, I'm convinced you'd be particularly ""overwhelmed"".",Moshe K
40,Not a bad place to hang,Not a bad place to spend some time. I'm not a great fan of rollorcoaster but there are some I will explore - kids on the other hand had a fantastic time.,Henri B
40,Good Time,Six Flags has always been a great place to have some family fun. If you are into thrills you need to visit! Food is a bit expensive but then again it is expensive no matter what park you are at. I felt safe there and I felt that my children were safe as well. Not much for shopping but then again we were there to have fun on the rides not shop!,gtrace
50,great and scary,"6 Flags is a great place to get your thrills. Great rides and an all around good time, but make sure you arrive early.",Ken V
40,Go for the rides,"Returning here never gets old if your going for the rollercoasters. Go on a weekday if you can, weekends are terribly crowded. If u can get in as soon as it opens go right to X2 and Tatsu (the longest rollercoaster lines) or head to the back of the park first. Of course a season pass is a great value but the food quality needs a lot of work.",SxcyMike
50,Coaster Capital of the World!,"Magic Mountain I would only recommend to people who can handle been thrown about and like going upside down! The rides are totally awesome! Twisted Colossus is something else and what you don't realize is that you going around it twice! Goliath is now my favorite ride, dropping 255ft into a tunnel it unbelievable! Most of the staff are friendly and can have a laugh with you sometimes.... Food is what you would find at any other theme park! Would love to visit this place again in the near future!",Sam M
50,Best thrilling rides in the world,"I've been to Magic Mountain every year. Six Flags Magic Mountain continues to come up with new rides so you are always in for something new. My favorite is Tatsu. However, please expect long lines unless you get the Flash Pass. I strongly recommend you get the Flash Pass if you are not a local. It's worth it. Also, the concerts were amazing!",trekkerFrank
50,"Awesome, thrilling",The best roller coasters I have ever been on.If you want a thrill go here so much fun by the end of the day I was shaking all over as was so thrilling!!!,Wayne B
50,Awesome,Your staff is amazing and your rides are awesome thank you guys for every thing I do however believe you should change some refund policies due to some miss wording on certain websites we bought extra tickets by accident and couldn't get our money back.,tonysteelrush15
40,What a BLAST!,"We went this first day of Fright Fest when the park opened. Only downside was all rides were not open right away. So we waited to get into the park then waited for the rides individually to open. Some didn't open until 11:45 (Jet Stream). The point of going early was to run to all the awesome rides first before the park got packed. That didn't pan out too well, due to the rides not being readily available. Still got through pretty well. Good was pricey in most places but some things were pretty reasonable. The staff was friendly and due to the AMAZING Labor Day sale we bought FOUR gold passes for under $280 and they don't expire until December 31, 2016!!!! We bought a picture pass for only $19, so every picture we take, we can download for FREE!!! Yup! Gate entrance pictures, ride pictures, Hurricane Harbor pictures, etc. great weekend. Can't wait to go back next month and December. ☺️",NeneFavors
50,X2 worth your ticket!,"Goliath, X2 (you have to go!) and Tatsu worth it your ticket! Good infrastructure and great attractions for all kind of roller coasters!",Cesar Fukuma
50,Magic Mountain is the family favourite theme park in USA,"Such a wide variety of roller coasters. Steel, wooden, launch propelled. High and fast. Hard to pick the best roller coaster park in the USA between Magic Mountain and Cedar Point in Ohio, but I think it is Magic Mountain.",Jeff J

40,A lot of walking but fun,My kids enjoyed the roller coasters. Very short lines. We were there on a Friday in October. Be prepared to walk a lot. There are some pretty steep hills in the park. The food is awful in the park. We did find a vegetarian restaurant that made a good strawberry spinach salad and smoothie.,123driveCA
40,All day Saturday trip with platinum flashpass and fright fest,"I was very apprehensive about this visit to Magic Mountain after reading many of the reviews, but in the end it ended up good. As many have said, the bathrooms are in need of some upkeep. There aren't that many bathrooms, so I think it would be a great idea to keep an employee in each one to make sure it's kept clean. My wife said the women's restrooms were gross. I'd say the men's restrooms were just old and kind of dirty.An area where 6 flags can definitely improve is their ability to answer questions by phone or email. I asked 2 questions by email and each time got a response in a few days. Each time they didn't give a direct answer, or they just replied with information I didn't ask about. There were a lot of words like ""usually"" and ""generally"" and never a simple yes or no. I then labeled my contact as a ""complaint"" and I still haven't heard back and that was 3 weeks ago. I then called the number on the website which was absurd and I just went in circles with various different prompts. I eventually got to speak to someone who said to contact magic mountain directly and gave me the number. The number I was given was the same exact recording and prompts as the number on the website. After 15 minutes of wasting my time, I decided to give up.Needless to say I wasn't getting a good vibe about this trip. We only had 1 day and probably won't be back for a long time if ever so the family of 3 got the platinum passes for $125 each plus $15 extra each for X2. We visited on Sat 10/3 and it was pretty busy with some lines at the 1 hour mark. Once we found out where to enter with the flashpass for each ride, it was smooth sailing. It was great to just walk right up and ride, bypassing everyone who has been in line for over an hour. We never had more than a 7 minute wait.Here's some tips- the locker rentals are unnecessary. Every ride has a place to leave your belongings. The picture deal for $30 seemed like a good deal except I found out that pictures are only taken on about 5 rides. I specifically asked if the photos could be printed at home and was told yes, but that is not the case, unless you do a screen shot from their very low resolution images.We tried to go to customer service to get a pin for my daughter's birthday but they only had 3 people working and after about 20 minutes, we gave up. Why would a park with thousands of guests only have 3 people working at guest relations?Many have said the workers aren't happy, but I didn't meet any unhappy ones. Maybe they weren't overjoyed, but none seemed unhappy.Food is crazy expensive but the souvenir drink cup was a good deal for $15 with free refills all day.We spent 13 hours at the park going at a leisurely pace and went on every coaster. My favorite was Goliath. Some of the rides were a bit too intense for my liking such as X2 and Tatsu. After about halfway thru our visit, I started feeling nauseous after each ride, along with a headache from the violent jerking motions. But our goal was to ride every coaster so we did. The park has 3 water rides but 2 of them were down. I checked the website that morning and it only showed 1 down indefinitely so we were a little disappointed. Roaring rapids was open and it was fun and we got pretty wet.Fright fest started at 7p and it was very entertaining. There were long lines for the mazes but we were there for the rides. They had zombies hiding in the bushes that would jump out and scare people which was really funny. What got old was every zombie you passed walking right up in your face and yelling. It was funny the first few times but after that it just got old.Overall, it was a good trip. I'm glad we got the platinum pass and did it all in 1 day. I can't imagine spending hours in lines and having to spend 2 days at the park. And don't worry if there's a big line at the entrance prior to opening. The park is huge and everyone seemed to go different directions.",Jay S
50,Awesome!,"Had a great time here last week. We went on Friday so the lines were basically non existent till about 3:30 when school let out. We were able to hit all the rides by 3 and just go back for a second or third time on our favorites once it got a little busier. Plus they started ""fright mares"" at 7 pm. My kids didn't want to stay for that, but it looked fun. The coasters are amazing. Loved Goliath but twisted collasus had to be the fav.",Ipassgas
50,Best roller coaster park around.,Has to be be one of the best roller coaster parks in the world. Get a look online to plan you visit the newest most extreme rides are the busiest and line can be as long as 90min. The lines are shorter in the morning the later in the day. The Flash Pass helps in getting more rides in but will be costly. I recommend it if you want to get in the best rides without spending more than 8 hours at the park. There are height restrictions on many of the more adventourous rides. Food can be a bit pricey.,dsh00ya
40,An interesting first time in an American theme park....,"We visited here in September as two English tourists experiencing an American theme park for the first time.Well, the rides are insane! (Watch the Point of View Youtube videos of the rides before you visit, if, like me, you aren't keen!) The overall experience was good but we thought it was incredibly overpriced once you actually got inside the park, especially as they don't allow you to take your own water/food inside! On a baking hot day in sunny California, getting enough water quickly became an expensive problem. The food outlets were greatly understaffed, causing massive queues/lines with no shade for customers and the food itself was pretty bad to say the least. (We opted for the healthy option and it wasn't great) The other facilities were fine and if you want to save money, book a few days in advance online. Parking for the day cost us $20, which we thought was a crime, having already paid for tickets. Probably a great place for families with children over 7 and teenagers.",Rebecca B
40,Exhilarating,"Being a theme park lover, couldn't wait to get here. If it's massive thrill rides and stomach churning rides that you want, notably roller coasters, go here!We arrived early and managed to get on about 5 or 6 rides in a row, without queuing, and were able to get the front row at times too. However despite being September, the queues got long quickly. The waiting times weren't accurate, we spent 90 mins when it said there was a 20min wait, this left us dehydrated and meant we went over the allocated time on our locker. Talking of which, I wouldn't bother to use these as they are a rip off. We arrived and saw signs saying no bags allowed at all, and that there was no place to put your bag once you got to the front of the line. We therefore naively paid the overpriced charge for the locker and then found that you could take your bags to every ride and there was always places to leave them while you ride. Having said that, when we couldn't access our locker (as we left the bag in too long and the machines to release them were out of order!), we quickly found helpful staff and weren't charged for the extra time.I thought I was a roller coaster fiend, but even for me, there were more rides than my stomach could handle. I'd say to plan ahead, pick out the rides you fancy most, plan your route round the park (as its bigger than it looks) and get there early and head straight to these. Anything else you get on is a bonus. Had my head and stomach been able to handle any more rides, by the time the afternoon came the queues were way too long to stand about in the extreme heat anyway.We certainly didn't feel that we missed out by not doing all the rides, some of them were similar.Not particularly kid friendly compared to the likes of universal and Disney. Great fun though. You tube was handy, we checked out some videos for recommendations of the best rides, or, ones to avoid! Would go again.",Rebecca W
40,Great Coasters but Food & Beverage Department need help,"I have been going to this park for more than 20 years and I still love it! The coasters are the best and they keep building new ones which is great. The newest ride, Twisted Collosus is a great updated version of itself and is actually really long! Lex Luthor's Drop of Doom takes your breath away and has amazing views of the whole park! I could go on about each ride but they are all fun... The food and bevrage situation needs help however... We went on a Wednesday so thought it wouldn't be busy; turns out it was a Jewish holiday so it was very busy...With that being said, they should have had more options for dining. (Or at least staffed it better) Many were closed and the ones that weren't had VERY long lines; i waited longer for my nachos than some of the rides! I paid extra for the Platinum Flash pass and it was worth it! I was able to go on 16 rides that day where if I had to wait in all of the lines, it would have been less than half that. I would say that the staff needs to be more informed on things going on the park as well. I asked the guy working the line about the flash pass and he didn't know anything about how much it was or where to go. When I got to the park, I asked a employee out front if I had to stand in line to get my season pass and he said yes.. well, wasted 45 minutes as it turned out, if you have your voucher printed out, you can go right to the turnstyle. PreShift would be a good idea at this park. Better to buy your tickets online more than 3 days in advance as you get a better price. If you like rollercoasters, you should definitly spend the day here!",Chase C
50,Twisted Adventure,Fright Fest was so fun and just the right kind of scary. The rides are the epic adrenaline rush. The new Twisted Colossus was the best and the Drop of Doom was breath taking. Tatsu is another ride that will blow your mind. Season pass is the only way to go if your going for more than one day. Stay in a hotel close by to rest from the heat for a couple hours during the hottest part of the day. Great chance to get some good local mexican good. The flash pass changes price daily but on a Saturday it is worth every dollar! We had an amazing weekend trip to Magic Mountain. Visited from Vancouver Wadhington.,regalpeacock
40,Best theme park in California,"We went to Six Flags on a weekday in September. We had some issue at the entrance because we would not bring a selfie stick so we had to go all the way back to the car and come back. First of all, we did buy a gold flash pass because we visited from Belgium and we wanted to do all the rides. We did have to wait a half an hour to get the pass which is kind of weird since you're paying to be able to do more rides that day. The gold flash pass is a MUST when you are only going to visit the park one time. It saved us so much time! We only had to wait ten minutes for viper and twenty for Goliath... The new coasters such as twisted colossus and full throttle took us an hour to wait. We were able to do all the rides on one day. Best theme park ever!",Pieter C
50,Mother & Son Trip,My yon and I are big roller coaster fans. I use to go to Magic Mountain when I was young so I wanted to share this with my son. If you want to ride the roller coaster without standing in a long line you need to be at the park when the open the doors.,Marquita B
20,Dont pay for maze passes,Always fun but a little packed for the fright night thing. Was kind of upset that I paid extra for he maze passes and couldn't even get into more than one because the lines were so long. kind of a waste of money when the lines are like 4 hours long and its only going for 6 hours. Enjoyed the park but wish I wouldn't have bought the extra passes.,bre r
50,Best Roller Coasters in the West,"I have been visiting Magic Mountain occasionally over the past 15 years. Almost every other year, six flags comes up with another innovative ride. This year we got to experience the newly updated ""Twisted Colossus"" and it was the most fun I have had on a wooden coaster. I was a little sad to see this classic coaster that's been in so many movies and tv shows be changed to something else, but they have taken this classic and made it so much better.Full Throttle doesn't look like much when you walk past it, but I highly recommend it. It's super fast, and currently holds the record for highest vertical loop. Definitely go at night, so you can see the lights of the entire city upside down.Tatsu was intimidating, because you're just sort of hanging in your seat face down, but when you get out on the ride, it feels like flying. This is clearly the most popular ride, as the line was 1hr or more versus 30-45 minutes for most others. Because of this we only rode it once.I do recommend going to Magic Mountain when it's open weekdays so you can fully experience the park without hour long lines. If you do go on a weekend, make sure you take the whole day so you have time to ride all the coasters you want to go on.",Andie_Grace
20,Great Disappointment,"I visited the park on Sunday, September 20th... I needed to pick-up my 2016 season pass, which took me an hour of waiting in line... There were only 2 people working, when there should have been no less than 3.Revolution was closed..... Viper was great, no lines, Roaring Rapids, a HUGE LONG LINE, so because I barely had an hour left, I decided to forego that ride.I wanted to ride the Apocalypse, but they only had 1 train available.... Too long of a wait.Many attractions and food services were closed, which left not many places to eat.Water is $4.50 a bottle, but they has a ""Special"" 2 for $6..... SERIOUSLY? So, you bring your own bottle and ask the food staff for ice & fill up at the water fountains for free.So, I went on over to ""Twisted Colossus"": Now the thing about the Original Colossus was It WAS a Traditional Wooden Coaster, and that was the JOY of riding it, the Nostalgia and total lack of extremism. There were two tracks and two sets of trains, side by side..... No Longer..... It is one EXTREME twisting, turning, hella-fast modern ride, which doubles back onto what was the 2nd track and resembles nothing from my childhood. I HATE THE CHANGE!I don't think Magic Mountain realizes, that although many of us older adults visit the park, we like and want a balance of rides from our childhood, we like nostalgia and memories.... A ""Traditional"" wooden coaster fits the bill, and ""New"" does not mean improved or better.So after two rides and waiting for 1 that I left the line of, it was almost 5:30 and the restaurants were closed......If I didn't have a special w/ a 2016 pass & free parking, I'd not be going again......This is no longer a park where there is something for everyone, it is for little kids & those into EXTREME Thrills.....",Auntie-Nanuuq
50,A thrilling experience for all,"Best theme park for thrill rides! There are fun rides for kids too. A MUST to add to your vacation.Their holiday decorations are quite amazing too, especially the Christmas time. They have snow falling, lights that change with the music, and the coolest are the glasses that make the light change into snowmen or Santas.",LCB2
40,Scare Fest,Visited on a Sunday and a lot of rides had queues of only 15 minutes. Some you could just walk on. Park comes alive at 7 when the scare fest happens. Very well done and a lot of money and effort put into it.Only downside is the toilets have seen better days. They can invest millions in rollercoasters but can't spend a few bucks getting the restrooms up to scratch?,Ashgamon
10,"Over priced, disorganized, and not very clean!","We went on a weekday in September, and it was PACKED!We waited to pay for parking, we waited for the bus, we waited for security, we waited over an hour for a flash pass. By the time we started actually riding the rides, over two and a half had gone by. We were unable to eat at the park - the lines were huge!All in all, I wish I had saved my money. We didn't get on all the roller coasters, and we had only the one day to visit. The washrooms were unclean, the park itself just felt dirty. I would recommend calling ahead and finding out what is going on that day....the weekday we went, there were three or four schools there. Had we known that, I would've went on the weekend. It was incredibly busy, and the lines were absolutey ridiculous.",monocco
20,A total mess from the start!,"IMO overpriced and I feel sorry for people with families as a fun day out will cost them $500's onwards.When we arrived at the Park the parking was disorganised and there was a lack of buses to the ground and we arrived at 10:30 for opening.When we turned up at the gate I was refused entry with my GoPro stick, I said there are no signs anywhere that state they are not allowed and was told all instructions are online. Although on the sign at the gate the 6th statement on the list is ""NO OUTSIDE FOOD & DRINK""... the first item on the sign states ""NO FIREARMS"", seriously messed up!Don't bring any food or water or they will take that of you as well. If not for the argument with our GoPro stick & hidding it in the bushes instead of having to go all they way back to the car we would not have snuck our bottles and sandwiches in & had been forced to buy the unhealthy junk they sell over priced, $5.75 for a btl of small cola is a joke!!Not all bad but there is more....the rides of course are fun but some of them only have 1 car working and the queue takes twice as long with no notice.Almost every ride we went on had too many empty seats, I counted 6 empty seats on 1 ride as we waitied for the car to unload including 2 side by side. They need to introduce single rider queues and become more efficient.This could have been an amazing visit if not for the entire Park being so disorganised, we will leave here happy we experienced the thrills ups and too many downs of Six Flags, they need to look into the skills of the Parks in Florida.",Tim C

50,"Great Park, Want to Visit Again!","This place was awesome! The coasters are over the top, like they have an extra element to them our Canada coasters just don't have. I got on X2 and was terrified out of my mind, but that just means it was a good ride. Tatsu was amazing and Twisted Colossus was the best coaster I ever rode!People were friendly too. I had to go on this trip for a conference alone and a man and his two sons talked to me in line for the Roaring Rapids, a girl befriended me and rode with me on Tatsu and another couple walked around with me for a bit and we rode things together.It was hella hot this day. 103 degrees. It nearly made me sick, but they can't control the weather. Also, the short day (open 10:30-6:30) didn't allow for even 1/3 of rides to be ridden. But part of that was my rheumatoid arthritis. The burger near the rapids was delicious and I appreciated that they had liter-sized water for sale. Their food prices were much better than at our park, Canada's Wonderland. So were the apparel and merchandise prices, even with the exchange.I want to go back here next September when I go to my conference again. But I will definitely allow 2 days :)Seriously...amazing rides!",AuthorCMelanson
30,Great Rides - Badly Organised,Probably the best rides I've ever been on. X2 is just amazing.So why a three star review? The park experience isn't that good. Half of the food and drink places are shut. The ones that are open are only half staffed. People are queuing longer to get a drink of water in the blistering heat than to get on a ride. Because they've cut the staff you can walk 100 yards to a bin to find its been turned against the wall so you can't use it. The best rides and the worst experience between them.They do in fact take the discover card.,Robb
30,Disappointed,"Park offers many fantastic roller coasters but feeding, resting and bathrooms are not so good. Details make the difference but this seems not to be important to this six flags park.",AUL_SP
20,Inefficient theme park,Full marks to the amazing rides but zero for the Park management. Long queues everywhere from security to entry to flash pass buy and worst of all at food joints. Took one full hour to buy flash pass. It took full one hour to buy fries and shake. A lot of good joints were closed. The open ones had excruciatingly long waiting times coz of being understaffed I guess. If the Park can't handle the load then it should allow people to being their own food. One goes to a theme park to go for rides and not to waste hours in queues everywhere. Poor value for money if you are visiting as a tourist like me and have just one day. Please skip this park.,Ayushi A
40,LOVED IT !!!,"X2 is the reason I came in 2002 (it was just X then) and came back in 2015. We live in West Central Florida so have a LOT of rides but I LOVE X2 and HAD to get back.

40,"Still great, after 25 years","I lived in LA as a teen and we had annual passes so went quite frequently, but hadn't been there since the '80s. This summer we took the kids and it was simply a better version of my good memories. More shade (did they even have trees in the '80s?), improved versions of old rides and lots of new rides. Disney was great when my kids were little, but they've outgrown Mr Toad's ride and this was a fantastic place to take them.I was terrified of the new colossus, though, and I'll leave that to the kids next time. Concave curves on the hills? HOW?",arsey00
40,"Good fun, shame about line cutters!","Really needed more than one day here to get on all the rides but we fit as much in as possible. It was also a very hot day (40'C). First ride was Viper which had no line and was fun. Little bit bumpy but great. Next was X2 which was the first coaster to actually scare my partner and I. It was nerve wracking!! Revolution was next, the last day for this ride (awww) before it gets remodelled for next year. Goliath was great, the 100m drop was intense!! Tastu was good fun apart from 10 people cutting in line in front of us due to friend in the line. Didnt say anything as they looked extremely aggressive. Shame though.",herefishyfishy123
50,Wow,Coming from New Zealand where we have one theme park with one roller coaster this was another world for me. I rode the top five and was buzzing. My only complaint was the worlds first loop roller coaster (can't remember name) which shook us up worse than the modern ones,Martin0NZ
40,Screaming fun at Six Flags Magic Mountain,"Had a great day at the park....so many coasters to choose from and test your nerve on! For this 50+mum, there was one or two that looked a bit beyond me but I went on all the other extreme thrill coasters and loved it! I guess being a Monday, the crowd was down but it was annoying that most rides only had one carriage running which made wait times long (and the wait time signs irrelevant!) same goes with the food outlets that were seriously understaffed . But apart from that, we had a great time.",Jools3137
40,So much fun!,"This place is great for families with young children to adults. They have an area for children, and other rides for the older guests. The best ride for me would be X2. Roaring rapids is a mist unless it is cold because you will get wet. You ride with other people, but it is a blast! Goliath is fun, but not suitable for all riders, especially those with medical issues. There is a turn that the ride does where you are being pushed into your seat and I almost blacked out every time during that turn. Otherwise it is fun. Viper is a good ride, but your head bounces back and forth on the shoulder bars, so you could get a headache from that. They have a wide variety of food, and arcade games as well.",scrub624
50,The best rollercoasters in the west coast,"Six Flags Magic Mountain , a family friendly themepark for young and old,and for the rollecoaster entusiast,located a few minuttes outside the town of Valencia in california, and is about 30-45 minuttes by car from the city LA(Los Angeles) depends on traffic of course, has gathered a collection of rollercoasters and rides that will not dissapoint, even the toughest thrillseeker.The ticket prices are not the most expencive either, and there is also great deals online to enter the park,. If you are a international visitor or outside US traveler you can also buy LA city passes to enter the park and other theme parks.",Thor K
30,Disappointed,"This park had been on our 'to do' list for a long time. I only wish I had researched it better. I highly recommend buying tickets online before arriving. They are much cheaper. Also, we visited in August- without the flash pass we hardly got on any rides. The staff were just not as nice as at any other theme park we have visited before. I'm sure my children will revisit at some point of their lives, however I will never return.",coco40
20,Not as nice as I thought,I was excited to go to Six Flags as we do not have any where I live. I've been to various parks around the nation. This was probably the worst I've been to. I'm not sure what it was but the park seems kind of dirty and a bit run down. The rides were fun I will say that but the park as a whole was a bit dissapointing.,dhayden_ak
10,Some rides are awesome but the park it self is crap!,"Before this trip I tried to find information about beeing plus sized going on the rides.basically did not find anything.If you are tall and overweight there is a good chance you will not fit on alot of the rides!No one told me on any of the rides i could not fit in that they had bigger seats, wich I found out at customer service that they actually have!I told them they should have better avareness for people that are plus sized.they did not care..I bought a Flashpass (gold) wich is a must if you want to go on the rides without haveing to wait ludacris wait times.The park it self is badly maintained. trashcans are overfilled. bathrooms not cleaned well. food is bad and really overpriced.the good part is that most of the rides are really good!",Kristjaneinarsson
20,Not as exciting as I expected,"It was my second time in California and having read and heard a lot about the park, I definitely wanted to visit it.Getting there (no car)I wanted to spend the whole day in the park and it didn't seem possible to do it in one day coming from LA and returning to LA in the evening using public transportation. So I decided to stay two nights in Santa Clarita. I took a train to Santa Clarita from Los Angeles Union Station, the next morning got to Six Flags by a local bus, and took a train back to Los Angeles the morning after. Santa Clarita bus system is not on Google maps trip planner, so I had to find the information on other websites. The buses were on time and not a problem.Long linesI was visiting on a Tuesday and there were not too many people. But for some reason the lines were very slow. At the opening time I was standing in a line just 10 or 12 meters from the entrance, but it was moving so slowly that it took 25 minutes to get in! I got the impression that the reason the lines were so slow was that it was all not so well organized by the stuff members.Lack of informationNot enough signs around the park. It took me some time to find places.LockersOn some rides there are signs saying that you can't go on a ride with bags or lose items and have to leave them with a member of your party or rent a locker at the ride's entrance. I was not happy with having to pay extra on those rides. Actually, I found out that all those rides still had some space to leave your belongings right before you go. There is no a hundred per cent guarantee that your left items will still be there when you are back from the ride of course, but I didn't rent any lockers. I just left my stuff on the floor near while riding and luckily everything was fine.RidesI'm not an expert in roller coasters, (We have nearly none in Russia!), but those I tried in American Disneyland, Disneyworld and some other places were unbelievably cool, and I rode some of them 10 times in a raw! In Six Flags I really enjoyed only two - The Twisted Colossus and SpiderMan. Unfortunately, I couldn't ride them more than once due to the very long wait times:(All the other roller coasters were no fun at all and rather unpleasant experience. They were not scary and not exciting. They were so fast, bumpy and turning from side to side so much that I couldn't actually understand, see or feel anything but a terrible pain in my neck.I'm, of course, describing my personal experience and I guess some other people find it fun if their necks and heads don't hurt:)",driamland

There were a few rides we didn't sit in line for because they were over an hour wait but the others were fast and even had a chance to go twice on some.

You should definitely arrived early, since even with the most complete flash pass I was unable to get on all the rides.Also due to the amount of rides, and the time, you should get a flash pass to get the most out of your day.During my visit, many rides had techincal difficulties and briefly shut down, if you have the flash pass, try going for another ride and then come back, it will save you time.Overall it is a great theme park with astounding rides.",Luis C
50,Fun !!!,"The best time ever. It wasn't very busy at all. I did find some deals on souvenirs. We utilized the Flash pass to make a reservation for our rides. We had a blast !! The ride ""X2"" was the scariest and ""Tatsu"" was the funnest.",Melissa R
40,Labor Day Surprise,"Labor Day visit was actually no too bad. Yes of course it was crowded, but nothing bad. The workers were actually nice this visit and lines seemed to move well.

10,Horrible Place Despite Great Coasters,"The problem is that there are only huge roller coasters, nothing else. Just look at their website. One can distinctively feel that this park (other than Disneyland for example) has no customer service oriented management and ""no heart"". I never got pushed around like this before from Latin Gangs who jumped the line. As several readers on TripAdvisor noted that there were several gang related stabbings each night until they made all guests walk through metal detectors! There was also a lack of decent food & beverage choices. I was thirsty and could only find cheap T-Short and Trinket shops. I can only recommend this park for serious coaster fanatics. But leave when it gets dark!",Atlantic_Voyager
50,Better rides than Disney,"Shorter lines for the most part, and there are rides way back in the park with NO lines at all and you can just keep riding over and over. The food is also cheaper than Disney, but no park is going to be super cheap, so set a budget and stick to it.",sweet_insurgent

50,Roller Coasters and Light Crowds,"I went awhile ago (mid-April 2015) and the park was simply amazing. With the exception of one ride operator managing the queue on Tatsu, the ride operations were handled nicely. A quick mini-review of the roller coasters:Full Throttle - Nice initial launch and you hang upside down in the vertical loop for a long time. The return is exhilarating with a ride up and over the vertical loop as the final act.Tatsu - Not much is like the force that is delivered on this flying coaster. The wait for the 1st ride took awhile, but the ride (even with a dilapidated orange color on its gigantic support columns) is amazing. Diving towards the ground put an impressive amount of gravitational force on my body.Apocalypse - A decent ride, although it was only running one train and, therefore, we waited 50 minutes for it, which was not worth it.Riddler's Revenge - I had always heard negative things about stand-up coasters, but this was the hidden gem of the trip. Three beautiful rides on a stand-up coaster with its signature loop around the lifthill.Green Lantern - I found it to be painful, although this isn't the consensus. The first drop is abrupt and I got snapped back on both rides. I also did not spin due to the balance of weights not contributing to a very impressive experience.Batman the Ride - Just forceful. The front seat was great and I got to ride it three times due to the lack of a crowd.Goldrusher - The oldest roller coaster in the park. Not a bad ride, but I was a little cramped even at 5'10"".Ninja - Another hidden gem, following the terrain on Samurai Summit. I am not sure how many suspended coasters there are like this in operation anymore, but it was a fun ride.X2 - The biggest adrenaline rush at the park that day. The butterfly vests, the overload of sensory stimuli in the station, the backwards climb with Sgt. Hartman from Full Metal Jacket berating Private Pyle playing in the background. And then the drop face forward. The rest of the ride is an intense forces blur, but a great overall experience, especially being able to overlook the park's impressive roller coaster collection as you ascend the lifthill.Viper - Two quick rides before park close on an old looping coaster. A lot of people complain about the pain on the ride, but if you keep your head firmly pressed into the headrest, the banging is minimal. I enjoyed it. It has a quirky tight loop elevated high off the mountain floor.I would recommend only going after you have done research so as to avoid waiting in lines, because I have heard horror stories of people riding only a couple of rides after dropping a lot of money. If you play your cards right, it is an amazing experience for anyone who enjoys riding roller coasters.",Ben F
50,We were lucky...It rained!,"I am not a devotee of amusement parks. However our friends were adamant that if we ever wanted to go to an amusement park, then this was the ultimate iterance. To our surprise, the californian draught, which was the worst in one hundred years, ended and the heavens opened, deluging the area. The upshot was fantastic. The park, which would otherwise have hosted tens of thousands at a time, was left barren save us and ten or so others, who had experienced rain before and were therefore not as traumatised as the West coast crowd. We found ourselves running through empty queus that if full, would have taken hours. Every now and then, we simply stayed on the rides and went again, and were repeatedly told by attendants how ""insanely lucky"" we were. Though I don't imagine this kind of thing is likely to reoccur any time soon, I can definitely say that it was worth the trip out of LA. I love Uber!",GoffandSarah
40,I'd hate saying never been to Six Flags!,If you like the thrill and adrenaline rush this is where you should be heading ! If you suffer from motion sickness (like I do) its gonna suck for you..Rules of the thumb1. Get the VIP pass so you dont wait in lines 2. Bathrooms are always dirty in places like this so its normal 3. Go on superman and Tatsu rides 4. It would be awesome if you have a go-pro 5. If you dont have a VIP pass you will probably miss a some of the rides and last but not least NEVER GO ON WEEKENDS .,Lamiita
40,"Great Fun, Lots to Do, Fun Park","This amusement park is fun for the entire family. There are so many attractions, I can't list them all, but if you're coming in summer or on weekends, prepare for large crowds and long waits for rides and food. Don't forget sunscreen and hats or sunglasses, as it is very hot, dry and sunny during summer months (100+ F). Beware of over-priced concessions, as there are affordable options to try. Some rides may be out of service for one reason, but most are open in peak months.",Bill G
30,The lineups.....,"Great rides but terrible lines. Yes, we went at a busy time (August weekday) but wow! 2+ hours in line for most rides is too much and signs indicating wait times are grossly inaccurate.The park facilities need updating and better recourse is needed for those who've waited in line, only to find out the ride needs repair; 2+ hours wait, only to hear ""we're sorry"". Not the employees fault, but at least a front of the line pass or free drink coupon for those who were closest to riding, would have been nice.All in all, fun rides. I'd return but definitely not in summer.",Lov3ly
30,"Best Thrill Rides, Horrible Lines","Plenty of kiosks to sell, but restrooms are almost always filthy and missing soap. There are a few janitors, but they cannot keep up with the thousands of visitors. The lines for the thrill rides usually have a duration of 1 to 1/2 hours wait time on weekends. Most staff is friendly, but I ran into some real ignorant prejudice people on occasion. These exceptions think they are the security and treat the visitors with dismay and lack of friendliness. DO NOT drop your mobile phone, as the staff will never go out of their way to help retrieve it, even if it is in a safe area, but requies a broom length handle to reach. Parking is 20 bucks, as if the price of admission wans not enough to feed their children.",Imad H

The problem is getting on them. We arrived at park opening, and hurried over to X2. There were maybe 20-30 people ahead of us in line. It still took us 30 minutes until we got off the ride! This was very foreboding.We went on a scorching August day. All the rides had an approximate wait time of 90-120 minutes. We decided to splurge on the Platinum Flash Pass. The perks of it are unbelievable, but very costly- 129 per person. And even then, they do not give you an additional ride on X2, and only once on Twisted Colossus, Superman, and one other ride I cannot recall at the moment.While lines may be out of the park's control, ride efficiency certainly is, and they did nothing to improve the situation. Loading and unloading is done in the same dock, which delays the ride time. That also means being stuck on the ride while waiting for the car to arrive at the track.Finally, there is ZERO park organization. There are no signs directing you where to go aside from the simple arrows. There are no signs anywhere telling you of ride maintenance updates or wait times (we walked 20 minutes to Twisted Colossus to find out it was broken down!). And speaking of which, there is no maintenance. The rides continuously broke down. We twice attempted to ride Tatsu only to be told it was broken down while in the loading dock. The second time we were told for 30 minutes to not leave the line because it was a short issue. After 30 minutes, an attendant told us the problem is worse than they thought, and he recommended to return another time. We left the line at that point, and not five minutes later saw the ride operating again.Summary:Park operation: 1Organization: 1Rides if you ever get on them: 10/10Six Flags has so much potential, but it is so wasted in the way the park is runP.S.: Tip: Every ride has lockers for rent at a cost. The only ride you must use a locker for is X2. All other rides allow you to leave your items at the station. Save your money.",ekrakauer
30,Nice but out of date,"Nice place for thrill seekers , only good thing are the rides other wisetotal disappointment ,my advise is to arrive early buy tickets on linethe 5 day ahead tickets much cheaper one day tickets .",Tarek M
40,Coaster Heaven!,"Ok, let's start off by saying that those expecting Disney or Universal level theming and lots of small child friendly attractions, you're not doing your research. Six Flags parks as a whole cater to an older, thrill seeking demographic.Ok, with that out of the way, this park is the king of coasters among Six Flags parks. You want high drops, huge loops, 100mph, backwards flipping craziness? Then you've chosen wisely. We had a great time especially since, being Six Flags parks veterans, we knew what to expect.The park is huge, and slightly confusing to navigate, if you get turned around, just ask a park worker and they'll get you on your way. Food and drinks are the usual over priced fare, no surprises there. The park as a whole is pretty clean, some of the men's restrooms could use some work, but nothing too terrible.Ride highlights for us were Superman, X2 and the new wood/steel hybrid Twisted Colossus. The wife and I made the trip from Texas to ride coasters, and we weren't disappointed. As this was a one day park specific visit we opted for the Platinum Flash Pass. It's the only level of Flash Pass to include Twisted Colossus (as well as the ability to ADD a single ride on X2). Since we are season pass holders the money we saved on parking/tickets was our way of justifying the expense of the Platinum pass. We had to trudge for the backside of the park to the front to ""reset"" our Superman Flash Pass as the ride went down after they already scanned our Flash Pass. Staff was very accommodating even offering us an ""instant"" ride reservation (whatever that is) which we passed on. More on the park staff, we found them to be friendly and helpful on our visit. In fact, they were more pleasant than the cast members at Disneyworld (Orlando) were on our visit there earlier this year, which is a first.The only negative points aren't really Magic Mountain specific, but more Six Flags as a whole (we've been to 4 of their parks). The ride queues are usually outdoors, and even when they are under cover, it's HOT! Rides not ready to run at park opening. Every Six Flags park we've been to is guilty of this (Fiesta Texas being the worst). They seem to not start ride testing until just before the park opens, resulting in lots of waiting to get In line to wait. Which may have something to do with the last thing, ride breakdowns. On our day at Magic Mountain X2, Riddler's Revenge, Superman and Green Lantern all broke down while we were in line. I know this happens at all theme parks, just seems to happen more at those under the Six Flags banner.So the 4 rating is strictly for the coasters/rides as they did not disappoint. The 1 point ding is due to the above comments about Six Flags in general.",Tweak89
50,SIX FLAGS YAY!!!!!,"Amazing, fun, and for thrill seekers!!! You will enjoy this park!! Just maintain hydrated during the heat!! But other then that be prepared for screams and fun and good times!!! I recommend to buy the 2 for 7 dollars caramel apples!!!! The one by the cold stone by apocalypse also the store there is nice and cold.",L5063JUjuanp
30,"5* for the rides, 1* for park mangement!!","ABSOLUTELY loved the rides!!Went on all the rides, the wait time was around 1 hour for the big ones, we visited on a Thursday and Friday in August.The only complaints we had were with the actual management of the park.One of the rides, had no front of the line management, and people kept piling in and going wherever they liked, when we looked over to the operators, there were about 5 of them all just stood around by the controls, this did not make me feel very safe to think they were not paying full attention to a very important job!When we visited, it was all over the TV that this area of California were in the middle of an excessive heatwave, so with that in mind, you would think the management would maybe put on extra members of staff BUT NO... we waited no less than thirty minutes in every queue we stood in waiting for a drink, there were hardly any water fountains, when you finally got to the front of the queue, there would be one poor girl stood there taking your orders, making your food/drink, taking your money, answering questions and then serve the next person... The whole process was just so slow and ridiculous, and in the sweltering heat when you just want a cup of water / drink was just stupid!Also, we waited for thirty minutes at a queue at a food hut which predominantly sold nachos, and when we got to the front of the queue at noon, they had sold out!!!I could go on and on about the issues we had with the 'management' side of the park, but I would rather you make your own decision... We loved the rides, but we did leave earlier than planned on our second day, as it was just so hot and with no easy access to drinking water.. we preferred to call it a day!",simone j
50,Teenagers and kids of all ages love this place!,"With dozens of rides in all height and age categories, there was never a dull moment.Some rides had longer waits than others, but that didn't mean there wasn't another option nearby.The title of this Six Flags, Magic Mountain, is indicative of the terrain at the park beginning from the parking lot. Lots of hills and walking. Be prepared with comfy shoes. Park security allows you to bring your own water if you like but prices in the park are reasonable - 2 bottles for $6. I found that all of the gift shop prices were reasonable too. Do not wait until you are about to leave to get a funnel cake, however. The line was about 50-60 people long. I noticed this on my first visit and my second visit.If you are a AAA MEMBER, they have a 40% discount on tickets and a small discount on gift shop purchases over a certain dollar amount.We enjoyed ourselves. Six flags never disappoints.",Cherese H
10,Go to Universal instead.,"Overly high, jolty and creaky 'thrill' rides. Left my knees and elbows bumped and bruised. Not a patch on Universal or Disney. Dirty and poorly kept. I love thrill rides, but these left me feeling unsafe.",AprilBBlu
50,Adventure at it's best,If you crave for some adventure than this is a place for you. This is no theme park and is definitely not meant for the faint hearted. 10 of the most amazing adventure rides will leave you gasping for breath by the end of the day.Always opt for their fast pass(the line skipper pass) to avoid long waiting lines.,riturajset
40,Best Roller Coaster with less wait times.........,"Visited first time, found attractive for kids, teen and elders. not far from Los Angeles. Better wait time then Universal Studios in Orlando. Easy to found rides not so much congested. Parking fee is a bit high. Verity of rides for all ages. Water fun also present.Must visit again..................",Omer.RON
20,"Closed rides, rip-off prices","I think the only ones who benefit at 6F are those with a season pass and the owners. It's expensive to get in, especially if you are not driving your own car as we weren't, being tourists.When we arrived, and bearing in mind 115F heat, no kiosks were open, the first 3 rides were closed - Viper, X2 and Tatsui - and it took an hour for just some of the kiosks to open.You have to pay for lockers: between $4-8 . Drinks from machines a staggering $4.50 or $5. When you are paying for a family of 4, that's a lot.When kiosks opened, the best deal was $12 or so free refill drinks. Lunch starts at $10 but more usually $15 per head.It lacks the slickness, the impressive surroundings of Florida theme parks which we have done in the past.I was particularly unimpressed by their water rapids ride which, unlike the Florida Universal one, did not have a covered area on the 'dinghy' to keep your belongings dry. So my back pack, camera case got absolutely soaked. The guy could have at least told me...My roller coaster -loving children just thought the park was a very good example of US capitalism at its worst.Would we go back? No. Even if I won the entrance money.",sbizzle
50,best day of our 3-weeks US trip,"This was probably the only time we ever visited Six Flags Magic Mountain and we only had one day so we bought the Flash Pass Platinum online. It is a lot of money but it is totally worth it if you go there during the peak season. It was a very sunny Wednesday in July and the line were very very long. We managed all rides except X2, some popular ones even twice. We had a great day there and I still watched POV videos on youtube to relive that experience. If you love roller coasters, this park is for you. If you have small children who are thrill seekers, find other places to visit. The park is huge so wear comfortable shoes, bring water and sunscreen with you.",CWU
40,Great Rollercoasters!!!,Visited twice now over the last 5 years and had the same experience both times. We choose school days to avoid the queues but the queues were still pretty large. The Rollercoasters are amazing but gutted that superman was closed for both visits. Not as clean and clinical as other theme parks but the best selection of roller coasters in one theme park I have ever visited!!!,Houstimus
50,Sixflags awsome,"Awsome rides for a great priceFood was great drinks all u could drink for one price and friendly and safe atmosphere , The water park is across the street at it is at a great price as well you could also buy the season pass for very low price or in payments interest-free they have great deals on their website Six Flags.com which includes freight face and a Christmas thing during Christmas at no charge",Rickprec
50,My Happy place,"If you crave thrill and speed this is the place. Wear comfy shoes and clothes and Be ready with your sunblock, Shades and sun visor because you will be out the whole day. Get a locker so your stuff won't get wet on the water rides.",Shayne79
50,Excellent,If you visit South California please make sure you visit Magic Mountain! If you enjoy roller coasters and do not mind waiting in line you will have an excellent experience!,Jehu R
40,"Very good with the flash pass, almost certainly dreadful without it","We paid a ridiculous amount of money to get the FLASH pass gold as we only had one day, are unlikely ever to return, and wanted to do everything. Annoying to only get one ride on Superman, Twisted and Full Throttle and to have to pay extra for X2. But (inasmuch as it could ever be) was worth it - rides are excellent and we left feeling we hadn't missed out on anything. Only concern we had was double-riding - we did this twice all day but struggle with the in your face nature of it (i.e. delaying the ride of those at the front of the queue).The place is big, and very very hot. There are long walks between different rides / areas. And queues were huge for the biggest rides - X2, Twisted, FT, Tatsu, Superman (weekday but in August). Other rides (Riddler / Scream / Batman / Green Lantern) but were probably never much above 20 minutes all day.Drawbacks are the same as with all theme parks - expensive food and drink, long queues for both, rides close on and off all day (Viper was out for most of the day, Superman and TC both on and off). But toilets were clean enough and staff were good throughout.Overall a good day, but I think I'd be giving it 1* and referring to it as hell on earth had we not had the flash pass.",EricWhite74
30,Busy...dirty....long lines.... too much closed or servicing equipment,Park was busy on every ride. Middle of August and a lot of rides were servicing cars so everything was slow and long lines. Park was dirty....not impressed. Prices are outrageous. We bring our on lunch since our family is Gluten intolerant and we had no problem bringing in food. Now I have seen it I would not go back.,Roy V
40,Be Prepared,"The not so good: lots of people, parking too far away, can get really hot, long lines, people are a mixed bag (I had a really bad experience with a young employee but management made it up to me). The good: lots of fun coaster rides, big park. The great: long hours, food and shopping choices.",bandit004
20,Spent an Entire Day Here,"First of, the rides are thrilling and will be hard to find more thrilling rides elsewhere. Definitely won't find them in Disneyland.The best one we tried is Tatsu which makes you suspended on your back so you are flying down and up on the coaster. Unfortunately, we were not able to try that huge drop tower (Lex Luthor) and Colossus since we went late.It's kinda sad but going to an amusement takes a lot of planning now. No longer can you just waltz in the afternoon and have some fun. In order to get through all the rides, you basically have to come at opening because 1) this will give you best parking 2) the lines will be very, very long for the rides, the most popular ones have wait time of an hour.Still, all is not lost for late comers. If you come late like after noon, make sure to do valet parking. For an extra $15, you don't have to park miles away and wait for the packed shuttle bus.But the most important thing for late comers is the Flash Pass. Corporate America to the rescue. To help park make more money, they actually offer a pass to cut everyone else on the line. Wow, just wow. Now I'm not sure if this is nice, but it works. I'm not even sure if you can get through all the rides without this pass. But we came really late like at 2pm and we almost made it through all the rides with this pass and probably miss about 5 key rides.Just remember to pay extra for the new ride X2. We got Platinum and nobody told us that X2 is not included so a big waste of time just to get to the ride as the path to the ride is long and steep.It's a fun time but extremely expensive with these Flash Passes and depending on how many people this can be a $500+ day.",Max D
50,The Mecca for Thrillseekers,"Been there in actually May 2014.Best time of the year probably to go as there was no queue at all for ANY rides ALL day.Be aware it would be a bit hot so get plenty of water and not much food.Book tickets on-line including car park and you will save time and money.Favs rides on top Itsu, Superman, The Riddlers and Full Throttle.I have a strong gut but this place has completely destroyed my resistance of Gforce.Astonished, Amazing place, very organized.",Fabs2Libs
10,Lines and Scams.,"The nightmare place of all nightmares at a huge cost. Even if you are a die hard who needs to ride roller coasters find some other place. Superman and Batman are still excellent rides, but not worth the hassle. One line to buy tix, one line for security and then a line to get into the park. THEN you try to get a Flash Pass. The ultimate scam and nightmare. A dumb system that requires you to carry around an Tomiguchi style pager where you have to reserve your next ride. Cool right? No. It's designed to make you run around the park getting concessions as you try to stay cool and get to the next Reservation. Add to that you are a salmon running upstream to use your GOLD pass looking like a jerk as people are getting off the rides. That's right! There is no dedicated line for your extra $50 to $125 pass. You basically have to sneak in the back door. Worst yet. Finding out there is no actual 1 hour wait at the ride and you could have just normally stood for 15 minutes and gotten on the ride. The place is filthy with the Superman ride looking like it's an ash planet not an ice crystal planet. There is old debris everywhere and you still have to climb that big hill to get across the park or up to Superman. Really a downer and disappointment. A place I would visit every five years has no become a place I will tell everyone not to visit. Ever.",DBuksh
40,"Great roller coasters, but be prepared to wait with several thousand of your closest friends.","I love roller coasters and so does my son. Our wives, not so much. We came to the park on a hot July day and I was going to buy flash passes, but I wasn't sure the ladies would get my money's worth and they have 3 flash pass options that all looked like varying degrees of a scam and they didn't include all the rides. In retrospect, I should have bought the high end pass but it would have more than doubled the entrance fee.The park is clean (but no Disney backstory) and the rides are huge! If it wasn't for the ridiculous wait time I would have given it a 5.Twisted Colossus is a serious hybrid coaster with the longest ride I ever been on. It's really a double coaster. Scream and Viper are quality steel coasters with the usual loops and rolls. Riddler's revenge is a ""stand up"" coaster with a smooth ride and great views. Green Lantern is quick but scary and a real shake fest. Goliath is just plain big.",michaelh409
50,Better this time!,"So it's 3 years later and I visited again from the UK. The kids had gone back to school and it was MUCH quieter. The park opened at 10.30 and closed at 6 which is still NOT long enough to ride everything in one day. The average queue was about 15 mins, nothing to complain about. Six flags did not have any cooling fans on inside the parks and everyone was struggling with the heat. The park was spotless and trash free. The eateries were also very clean. The toilets, not so good, in fact, they were appalling. The staff were great, really friendly and upbeat. The rides are just FANTASTIC but you need more time to get on them all. Twisted Colossus is the most amazing ride I think I have ever been on. Six Flags, I gave you a second chance and you rose to the occasion!",Bobbyhols
40,Rides were brilliant but everything else POOR!!,"Me and my partner visited here from the UK, on arrival we had to park quite a bit a way due to arriving at around 11am as you can imagine it had been open an hour so was heaving already. The walk in from our car was about 10 minutes and you could imagine it being hot wasn't really ideal, they only had 1 or 2 busses running. (ridiculous if you ask me) Lack of staff members around to ask questions or ask for directions, toilets were very disappointing, lack of cleanliness and hygiene was disgusting! (especially the ladies). Food was over priced and not great and very small portioned, trying to find a table in the shade that was clean was impossible. We was also very disappointed that on arrival even after paying for the platinum flash pass we still had to pay an extra $60 for 1 ride on X2 which should of been included. Overall the rides were brilliant and could not be faulted at all, we had a fantastic day. I just am annoyed and disappointed with the fact that these parks take in so much money each day and still fail in keeping there parks clean and tidy!",holly m
50,"Flash Pass, That Guy","We visted Magic Mountain on a Wednesday in August 2015 It was very hot. After visiting many thrill parks over the years, we upped our game and bought the Flash pass. There are three levels of flash pass, each costing more. We chose the Platinum level for an extra hundred twenty five bucks a person, ouch. The ability to go right to the front of the line was like a dream come true and for most rides you could stay on the ride and ride it the second time without having to get out of your chair. For many years we always saw those people and wanting to be "" That Guy "". Even with the Platinum it took us the whole day to get through every ride. A Luxury for sure but well worth it.",l5adventure
40,Kids Back to School Trip,"We decided to take our boys to Magic Mountain Six Flags as a back to school trip. They were so excited and the trip was worth the 5 hour ride. The trees surrounding the area gave a nice break from the hot sun. The lubes moved rather rapid and the overall experience was really nice. The park was clean and we enjoyed going 2 days in a row. If your in the area or just thinking about visiting, it's worth it. Get the passes or membership.",Thats_J
40,One of my favourite theme parks.,"This is the third time I've visited Six Flags Magic Mountain and I have enjoyed it every time. I used Gold fast passes this time and got on all the rides I wanted to. I would probably get Platinum fast passes next time though (I have had these the previous time I visited and found them to be faster and more rides are available on these rather than the gold).A few cons...Some of the ride queues can still be quite slow though, even with fast passes; Tatsu was especially slow as staff kept trying to race buckling people in with the other station and this slowed the whole process up. I have previously known this ride to run much smoother. The longest queues I experienced were the refill drink stations. It was a hot day (like most in July) and I found myself waiting for up to 30 minutes just to get my drink refilled.Pros...I try to visit as many theme parks as I can over the world and Magic Mountain has some of my all time favourite rides. I think the rides alone deserve at least four stars.My favourite rides have to be Green Lantern, X2 and Twisted Colossus. I found Green Lantern the scariest ride at the park but X2 and Twisted Colossus are really FUN!Overall, a great day of thrill rides (worth the queues)!",Becky367
40,Great for big rides and coasters. Love it or hate it.,"Six Flags Magic Mountain is one of those love it or hate it places.Loves: One of the best collections of coasters and thrill rides of any park, hands down. There are so many great rides (X2 (start with this when the park opens or the lines will be unbearable later on), Goliath, Tatsu (my fav), Superman, Green Lantern, Batman, Riddler, Full Throttle (also great and unexpected, but short), Ninja, and the list goes on). Season passes are cheap, you can regularly get a season pass in the fall that covers the remainder of the year plus the next year, often includes parking for about $5 more than a regular ticket. The park is also relatively clean.Hates: If you have small children, this isn't the park for you as there isn't much they can do (hit up Disney instead) Lines are crazy long and you will spend 2+ hrs per ride in line unless you shell out for the platinum fast pass, which is crazy expensive (although it is a must if you only go occasionally and want to make the most of your visit during peak days). Crowd that gathers here (mostly teens) isn't the greatest either. Food must be where they make their money, because it's way over priced, even in the theme park frame of mind.Still it can be fun in the right ways.Tips: Go early, get a season pass (they usually let you in about 30 minutes before everyone else, and hit up the big rides first (X2, Tatsu, Full Throttle) then head to the back to hit up Goliath and Twisted Colossus, then take the rest at your leisure.Buy the fast pass platinum if you are going to stay all day (during peak season), and pack a lunch in your cooler to visit your car for meals. Skip the lines and have fun!",Kalfgd
50,"Great place to bring the teens, adventurous parents will enjoy it too","To make the most of the Magic Mountain day, absolutely purchase the Gold option Flash Pass. Otherwise, most of your time will be in lineups. Food is a little expensive ($11 for a slice of pizza!) and plan for hot days if you go. Hurricane Harbor is very fun (again, Gold Flash Pass wrists bands make the difference between standing and riding), and make sure your shorts/bathing suits don't have metal ANYwhere, including the ""drainage"" holes in pockets, otherwise you can't go on some rides. The parks are clean and there are lots of amenities.",ST1300Rider
50,Magic Mountain family vacation,We have made magic mountain an annual family vacation trip. I think it depends on the timing of when you go last year we bought the flash passes but this year we went when all the kids were in school and we didn't need the flash passes. It's a smart idea to freeze water bottles and take them in with you buy the unlimited sports bottle and make sure you take time out of your day to eat.,Sumibunni
40,Family fun!,"We go 2x each year, buy the annual pass and if your family enjoys coasters, this is a must do! We drive 6 hours to get here and always look forward to it.Even the older kids (17 now) still enjoy the craziness.We buy the most expensive flash pass and this is why I downgrade my review to 4 stars instead of 5. For the amount you pay for a flash pass, the wait is still too long most of the time. It's a pricey day at the park and we pay the high amount because we only get there twice a year.Since they offer the upgrade, I think they should make it worth it! It's like 100+ additional per person. I guess I do recommend getting it when the park is busy, but I wish the value were greater foe the amount they charge.Great family park!",KaceyJack
40,Mission accomplished!!!,"They say every Six Flags is different so of course I wanted to visit Six Flags Magic Mountain being from NYC I've done every ride at Six Flags in NJ time for some new rides!!! And I'm glad we did the x2 was my favorite and the first ride we got on, I think we did them all!!!! Mission accomplished!!! Here's some advise remember it's a theme park except long lines (they went quick) its hot and wear comfortable clothing!!! Be a big kid have fun!!!",Noch90s
20,Man Six Flags Isn't What It Use To Be....,"Here's the thing about Six Flags. I think every year I decide to come it gets even worse. I just bought some tickets online to visit and there was no line to wait because I am a Discover card member. I think that's probably the only highlight of the trip. The flash pass thingy mabobber is funny! I finally tried it out and yes I will say that it is worth getting if you want to plan on riding more than 3 rides. Seriously even if you get to the park at open and stay until close you may or may not be able to get on all the rides. So.. I had a few hundred dollars to splurge so I went with the Gold option Flash Pass. The Platinum is way too expensive I mean for two tickets and two additional Platinum passes you'll be close to almost $700 spent and that's even before you get in the damn park lol. Aside from the annoying wait line, expensive food, snotty nose kids and teenagers running around I guess the park is good. Yes I know some people are probably reading this like well what do you expect from an amusement park right? Well one suggestion i have is they should have like one night a week that's adults only hehe wishful thinking. I'm not sure i will be back anytime soon just because I'm older now and my body cant handle the rides like it use to when i was 17yrs! I think reality just set in on this last trip! Yikes... so long six flags magic mountain.",BugattiBoi88
40,So glad we went!,"I was nervous to go on a Friday, during the heat, then there's the cost and those bad reviews. HOWEVER, we had a great time! Bought our tickets on line, were there when the park opened, it was clean, no rides were closed, and best of all the rides are fantastic! Can't wait to go again!",cff463
50,Great fun!,Most of the coasters are smooth nowadays. There are of course some exceptions with a few of the older ones that still jar you around a bit. Had enough time to go on nearly 12 of the attractions. Totally worth the price of admission.,Jonathan W
50,AWESOME,Wow ... the best park ever .... much better than busch gardens ... i went there with my wife and we had much fun ... be there as soon as the park opens ... u will get the rides without any lines..... the best roller coaster in my opinion is the x2 .... tatsu is the second in my list....Have fun,Guilherme C
40,Amazing park,"A must for any roller-coaster officianardo. All types catered for. Goliath was huge and Scream had the best loops. Only downside was the costs. $20 to park on top of the entry is just profiteering. Food and drink are ridiculously expensive. One gem is Viper.

It was so amazing.Superman was a totally different experience as it bullet start and goes backwards.Goliath and Full Throttle was superb too.A must visit park.the only thing i wish they take care of is the rest rooms because they were terrible and so dirty and in a such place you need to have a clean rest rooms.",Abdulrahman A

50,So much fun!!!,"This place is awesome. The rides are massive so if you don't like big rides this is not the place to go. There is not really any theme like in Disney and Universal but the rides more than make up for it. In the 3 times I have gone, there is always at least a few rides that are having issues and need to be fixed. The lines are massive and I would recommend getting the flash pass. It's a bit of money but it is definitely worth it as your wait time is significantly reduced. I will go back here any time I go to LA!",Rhi J
50,Birthday trip for Son-15,"Wow it was hot today 106* yikes! But the park had cooling stations all over. Water fountains at every restroom. And when you purchase the plastic souvenir cup, you get free refills all day long! That was worth it. As a bottle of water is $5. We drank about 40 cups of water! The park attendants were amazing! We got to hang out with Bugs and that was awesome! The food was amazing, over priced but worth the money you spend! The rides were scary. Lines were pretty decent anywhere from 45 min to and hour! Not really a big deal. It was a blast and my 15 year old son had a great time. We all got fun capes which crazy enough were only $6/each. The games every one wins and no one walks away sad. They had a great small child area with lots of fun rides and games as well. Thank you MM for the memories!!!",Heather B
30,Good coasters ... Mostly ehhh,Several very good roller coasters. Park is VERY dirty and needs some cleaning and maintenance. It's like the are balancing the numbers to max the profits - coasters bring in the numbers... Cut costs on cleaning and up keep ... Hire the fewest people to get work done ... Que people so they don't spend time needing service. Etc. if all you want to do is ride the rides you will probably have fun. More rides for teens than younger ones. The DC comics and looney tunes tie-ins are very weak.,Ken K
40,6 flags,Park was clean and didn't look dated. Very busy though but it was peak summer time and so fast passes were a necessity. Overpriced food like all parks but eat before you go and be sensible. The shuttle bus service was insufficient so just walk from carpark.,thomasole
20,Spend The Extra $ for Platinum Flash Pass or Don't Bother To Visit.,"First two tips to make your trip to Six Flags enjoyable instead of just bearable. First, pay the extra $10 to Valet Park as you don't need to start and finish the day hoofing it all over massive parking lots. Next, spend $100 to get the Platinum Flash Pass because it will give your whole party of up to 5 people the ability to skip all lines. So worth it!Going to Six Flags isn't a high-class activity so you'll come across plenty ghetto rats and obnoxious teenagers living it up and acting a fool! But this is where the Flash Pass will help you avoid being in close quarters for too long saving your sanity. The rides are really fun and worth going doing. Don't miss The Goliath and it's gigantic 250 foot vertical drop!",HuggyBearHonolulu
50,Awesome,If you live thrill rides this is the place. Coming from australia i was in ride heaven. Make sure you go early and stay till late. Cheap entry for a day out. Food outlets are all quiet good as well.Any aussies going to L.A make sure you go here,brisbane247
20,Too crowded and not enough maintenance,"In about 6 hours at the park we managed to get on 5 rides and experience 3 short maintenance issues. And this was on a Tuesday, this place must be hell on the weekend!First - just as we were about to finish a ride it broke down. Unfortunately we were just before the platform waiting in blazing sun for about 10 minutes for repairs.Next we go to one of the main attractions. After almost one hour wait, it breaks down just as we were first in line. After about 15 minutes we sit and it is still broken. After another 10 minutes it is finally fixed (I hope...) so off we go!Then we head to X2 and before we approach the line I hear a familiar ""doesn't work"" announcement so we go for lunch... (btw. the burger wasn't good either).Rides are obviously really cool but during this one visit there were more maintenance issues than I have experienced in years.",greg666
50,Great amusement park for thrill seekers,"My 7-year old son loves roller-coasters and he had a blast at Magic Mountain. Basically he said it was the highlight of his two week trip. I was here some 20 years ago but this place has now substantially upgraded itself in terms of variety of rides.You can say many rides are scary but honestly even at the adult age you have a lot of fun because the rides are very well designed. Some look scary but are actually really fun.We bought the Flash Pass which cuts lines by 90% and I thought this was essential to having a good experience. Yes it is pricey but it saves you a ton of time as waits are generally one hour long or more during busy months. My other friend bought the Flash Pass that cuts wait by 50% which was also fine, but in my opinion there is still a marked difference in how you could enjoy the day. Whether this is worth it depends on individual budget of course, but unless you are prepared to be there for multiple days, this is essential. Also, go early.We also did the valet parking which cuts down a lot of walking. Much faster in/out of the park.Food is pretty good btw. But just don't line up at Johnny Rockets. Super slow and inefficient!",EEEEA1234
20,3 Things to Know Before you go Here: You've been warned!,"I don't typically write online reviews but due to my experience at this park I must. My wife and I drove 10 hours from Utah to celebrate our 5 year anniversary. I was extremely excited and had high expectations. Sadly, after yesterday and today at the park I can say that I am truly disappointed. Here's why: 1. Long lines. 2. Dirty facilities. 3. Overall lack of focus on taking care of customers.The lines are long at this park. My wife and I spent 1 1\2 days here and got on 6 rides. I rode a total of 7 as she chose not to ride one of them. Even for me, waiting in lines for 10 hours to get on 7 rides is ridiculous. This could have been avoided though if the management decided to run things more efficiently. Most of the coasters had just one train running. Wait times could have been significantly decreased if they were to run multiple trains like they do at most other parks. To make matters worse, the trains were never completely full. It was common to see trains running at 2/3 capacity. I bet by making improvements here they could turn 90 minute wait times down to 30 minutes.The park was dirty. Trash was everywhere, and the pavement was sticky with spilled drinks. My wife and I ate lunch by what used to be a functioning fountain (assume to be off due to drought) but is now just standing water and something was growing in it. It smelled terrible. But it gets worse. Multiple garbage cans were not being properly maintained and had turned into nice habitats for bees. Some garbage cans had swarms of hundreds of bees around them. While we were standing in line for X2 we had to do our best to keep clear of the swarm. Some groundskeeping employees walked by and didn't seem to care the bees were there.Finally, I was disappointed by the overall lack of concern the park employees and management (evidenced by policies) had for their guests. My wife and I got season passes for $75 each. What a deal! But to truly enjoy this park you need to be willing to fork out another $80 - $125 per person. This is what it costs to get their worthwhile tiers of their flash pass. The flash pass allows you to cut in line in front of everybody else. Perhaps it is just me but I see something wrong with this. It almost feels like a bait and switch. Another example of this is the $20 parking fee. I spent $40 to park my car at this place!I won't be coming to this park again and I will be sure to let anyone I know thinking about going to not go. It is not worth the long lines, the risk of bee stings, and being treated like cattle. Next time I will spend my whole vacation at Disney. They cost twice as much but provide 10x the value.",Caleb H

40,VIP Tour Review,"Was lucky enough to participate in a VIP tour. It costs $$$ but is inclusive of all food and drinks, pictures, VIP parking, and front of the line front row on every ride you want. Save up some money and get 3 people to do the same and go with you, you'll get to ride everything you want and not have to rush. Our tour guide was Gee. (Hopefully I remembered that spelling right) She was phenomenal! Everyone in our party really enjoyed her tidbits and helpful attitude. She knew where to go and what rides were not available at the time and we'd swing back and ride again. She even rode a few with us! We hadn't been to Magic Mountain in 10 years and had limited time to go. We felt we got our money's worth for sure! Overall the park isn't as themed and exciting as Disney but we were there for the thrill rides and we were not disappointed! Make sure to get on Twisted Colossus. I was sad the old one got torn down, but the new one is exceptional! I would really like to ride it a few more times! Full Throttle is pretty amazing as well!",John H

10,Friend with a cast not allowed into the rides,"I was with a friend that had a cast on her hand and the staff of the park was clueless to which rides she could go on and which ones she couldnt. We had to leave the line on one of the rides to go to costumer services to get a special pass for people with movement problems and there they instructed us on which rides she could go with the hand cast, once we had the pass and the information of which we could visit we went back to the park hoping to enjoy the rest of the day. First ride we go to that we were suposed to be allowed to go with the cast and they turn us down, second, same thing. After that we were quite upset and just left the park. Just wasted two tickets and a whole day going there and not being able to ride anything.If they had told us upon arrival that the cast would be a problem and sent us to the costumer service in the first place it would have been a bit better, but having us go in line, wait, then on our turn send us to the costumer services so then we could get back to trying the rides but only to get turned down by the staff was possibly the most enfuriating situation I have ever been put on while in the US.",Sakubaba
50,Southern California vacation,We visited on a Thursday in late July. There were no lines for the smaller rides so all the kiddos hung together. The whole day was a complete blast. Bought our tickets online a week early and saved big time....under $50. The concessions were pricey but it is an amusement park...will we head back there next year? Probably not but not because of the park but because my family enjoys new things every trip.,Ronda M
10,"Horrible, horrible lines",We got here at 10:30 a.m. It's now 6:30 and we're only on our fourth ride. And it's a Monday!! Either they are understaffed (takes forever to get drinks or food) or they sold too many seasons passes. I don't think I will ever attempt this again; they are now on my no-go list.Disneyland was never this bad (and the lines at the Magic Kingdom are cooler and more interesting). We're paying about $15 a ride (if we can do a fifth before the park closes at 8). Too much! Not a good value.,mab60
50,thrill time,"excellent park, excellent adventure, some of the best roller-coasters I've been on, even the few that had a big line were totally worth it!",epickg
50,Great fun for big kids,Was pleasantly surprised at how much fun my partner and I had here. The ancient timber coaster was so old and rickety I feared for my life... and that's what you want at a theme park right?,InfinityandBeyond86
20,Very poor second compared to Disney parks,"A big disappointment. The roller coasters (the ones that were open that is) were great for the coaster buff. Arriving at the park the lines were long and not well supervised. Had to wait ages at guest services to get online tickets sorted. The coasters were great for the enthusiast but the rest of the park was a massive disappointment. You had to pay for lockers at each ride to look after your stuff while you were on them. To get a fast pass it was a large amount on top of the park ticket and then that didnt cover all the rides. The bathrooms were not very clean and not as many as wanted with large queues to get in. The retail and food outlets were badly managed. We waited in line for food for ages at 2pm - with only only one staff member serving. When I asked another staff member she said the others were on lunch or breaks. Two rides were unavailable with no explanation at all. The tram we went on broke down in 35 degree heat - no explanation or apology - just water handed through the windows while the staff stood about offering no advice. I have visited many theme parks over the years - Knotsberry Farm, Disney etc and this comes a poor second to them. Although the rides were good we only managed 5/6 in the full day we were there. Not a great experience all in all and I wouldnt go again.",Rachel66
30,Prepare for a slow and expensive day,"I don't know if it was just bad customer service or the incredible heat but everything and everyone in this park just goes at a slower pace.We got to the park at 10:30am on an apparently quieter Tuesday when the park supposedly opened but it took 45mins just to park the car (after the $20 charge of course). Once that was out of the way, it took a further 45mins to get past security and the turnstiles (I advise anybody to purchase tickets in advance as not only will you be in the queue for longer, it will set you back another $17 each).The first ride we went to queue for was X2, we waited for 10mins and were told the ride was experiencing technical difficulties (apparently this happens a lot with this roller coaster). We then headed to Viper, which we caught at the right time as we went straight on.Then every ride we managed to fit in after this (6 rollercoasters) were between 40mins to nearly 2 hours waiting times.Most of the queues do have shelter which is necessary because it is right in the valley heat. Make sure you take $50 for lunch and drinks because that's how much you are going to need for a couple ($15 for an average meal and $15 for a refillable drink).Be prepared to wait around 15mins to get your food in addition to a similar sort of wait every time you want to fill up your drink. If you can, fill your drink up away from the food halls as queues are generally slightly smaller.The roller coasters here are amazing but the shoddy customer services, extreme heat in addition to long waiting times for everything put a downer on the day.",Wayne H
50,Flash Pass on a Saturday...GO PLATINUM!!!,"DAY I WENT...SAT, AUGUST 8TH, 2015Average wait time to ride is 1 to 12 minutes max on the Platinum.Platinum Flash Pass is $125(Pre Order online before the day you go)***Also purchase your admission ticket at a discount price wherever you can find them before you go to Six Flags***Platinum Guarantees you one ride on: Full Throttle, Twisted Colossus, and X2**On X2, you have to pay an additional $15 to ride with your Platinum Flash Pass...DO NOT PAY THE ADDITIONAL FEE FOR X2...Instead, Get to the park before gates open and go on X2 first....Its only a 20 min wait and it saves $15 for each person in your party......Platinum also includes consecutive riding on certain rides if you stay in the middle of the ride. Just wave your wristband and they will let you stay on for a second ride.(The Regular or Gold Pass does not have this option)YOU CAN ONLY RESERVE ONE RIDE AT A TIME.When you reserve a ride, it will beep when its ready. After you are beeped, go to the ride and get into the flash pass entrance and get checked in....****AS SOON AS YOU GET CHECKED IN, RESERVE YOUR NEXT RIDE; BECAUSE AS SOON AS YOU GET OFF YOUR CURRENT RIDE, YOUR THING WILL BEEP OR GET READY TO BEEP FOR YOUR NEXT RIDE RESERVATION.I got on X2, Full Throttle, Twisted Colossus, Lex Luthor, Batman, Superman, Riddler's Revenge, Tatsu and more...the wait time for each was 6 min max the day I went. Hope this helps. Enjoy Six Flags Magic Mountain.",funnyjaguilar
30,Average,"Those who are going to be Visiting the park should know that if you go Thursday - Sunday you are going to be waiting in 1:30+ lines no matter what. And it will be very hot if you go in the Summer time. If you have a choice try to schedule your visit for a Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday. The lines will be much more Tolerable and you will be able to enjoy the rides at the park more...DO NOT BE FOOLED INTO BUYING THEIR ""FLASH PASS""Their cheapest option is $49 a person which lets you wait the average wait time for that ride while you are in line for another ride. (So you spend $49 to wait in line)Their second option like the 1st is $75 or $79 a person BUT it cuts the wait time by 25% if you are unlucky and going on the weekend This is still a bad option because the average wait time will be around 2 hours.Now their 3rd option is only $100-$125 a person and cuts the wait time in half.So you will spend all that money on the flash pass to just Wait anyway. Save the money and use it for beverages because you will need to keep the family hydrated especially if you bring young children.Dress Lightly because you will be in direct sunlight and it will be Very Hot. Wear comfortable shoes if you have Walking/Running shoes wear those because you will be walking ALOT.If you have a handicapped person in your party try to bring your personal wheelchair if possible. They do have wheelchair rentals in the park it is 1st come 1st serve their manual (push wheelchair) is a $75 rental that price includes the deposit. They do offer electric Wheelchairs for rent but I'm not sure on the price.They have a Handicap pass for rides that covers up to 4 people so if you have a party of more than 4 people the odd half of the party will have to wait in the line anyway. MAKE SURE TO ASK ABOUT THE handicap pass at the wheelchair rental facility.I went with my friend who is handicapped and we didn't find out about the handicapped pass until our second ride which then we had to go all the way back to the wheelchair rental place to get the pass.. It was my birthday we had a party of 6 and they refused to add on 2 more people to the pass. So be warned they will not add to the pass for any reason.The lines to purchase your tickets fills up quickly so the sooner you get there the better off you will be.The average height requirement for the rides is 54 inches (4'5) so if your kids are shorter than that you might want to Pass on Six Flags.",Azrarl2016
10,Horrible Customer Service,"On a recent trip to LA with family visited both magic mountain and universal. Six flags could learn a lot from their competition.Day 1 - Magic Mountain arrived at opening 10:30; long line to get into parking lot (maybe open up a few more lanes) proceeded to walk a mile to gate with hoards of people because only one bus running from lot to gate; after massive disorganized pass through security and ticket gate head straight for X2 since I been wanting to try this coaster but haven't been to LA area for a number of yrs but nope not open today so make the best of it and head over to tatsu; an hour later still in line and the ride goes down since we been waiting for an hr we decide to wait and see if it reopens and 30 mins later it reopens we wait another 1 hr before getting to the front of the que and bam the ride goes down again; now we can see a bunch of untrained staff dealing with unhappy customers. Ride operators and now their bosses are all standing around waiting for maintenance. 30 mins later they announce the ride has extended closure please go enjoy another ride; ok I know stuff sometimes has mechanical problems but surely after standing in line for almost 3 hrs and being at front of line they will give our family a skip the line pass to another ride. Nope they tell us their is nothing they can do and send us to customer service and were assured they will take of of us. We head over to customer service only to find a long line filled with unhappy customers. After another hr wait at customer service its 3:30 in afternoon and we haven't even been on a ride yet! customer service says will give you two skip the line passes. The customer service guy asks which two rides would your family like to ride. I reply X2 after I hear that it opened up during the day but NO customer service says ""we don't give skip the line passes for X2 or a bunch of other rides he lists out since they are to new"" really x2 opened 2008! So after getting some skip line passes for the ""old"" coasters I'm completely disgusted but the family wants to stay and ride some of the other rides. The park itself is absolutely disgusting. We rode the bump cars and the trash and cobwebs were piled up on the cage above the ride. another had wall of used gum in the que. I will never visit another six flags park ever no matter how much I enjoy roller coasters.day2 - Universal after magic mountain I'm hoping for better and yes universal came through big time.No problems getting in to park or through the gate; park extremely well maintained and clean; entertain you while in the que they had an employee asking riddles to the line and giving away front of line passes we didn't win but made the wait time pass much quicker. Wait time clearly posted throughout park; I could go on but here is where universal made a loyal customer. We were in line for mummy roller coaster and we were 3 from the front when the ride goes down. Immediately the ride staff goes into action handing out candy to folks in line then after 10 mins they start handing out skip the line passes (8 for our family of 4) after 20 minutes with staff telling jokes and riddles to the crowd the ride comes back on and we get to ride. now I know that sometimes rides breakdown and its out of management control however the two experiences were night and day. Apparently six flags has a lot to learn about customer service.If in the LA area and seeking out some amusement park entertainment do yourself a favor and go spend your hundreds of dollars somewhere else other than magic mountain there are far to many other options in LA",isrudy
30,"The best rides, but poor customer skills","This is the best park for high thrill coasters probably in the world. I doubt if anyone can put up such a collection and many of them are brilliant. You must do x2 it is just so different. Twisted collosus was way better than we expected a very good ride. Also love scream. Unless you pay more money for a front of line pass then you will be very lucky to do it all in a day. I have been 3 times over the years and it has always been the same.So they have great rides but they could learn a lot from universal or Disney on customer service. Everyone appears to go so slow. Ride changed are frustrating as you watch the attendants make no effort to complete fast turn arounds. Getting drinks and food is painful, big lines and slow staff. It took 2 hours to get into the park from car park to finally stepping foot into the park, terrible as everything is so slow. Then to top that the first ladies restroom had no paper.I love the rides and will come again but six flags needs to improve its customer skills.",joep735

Many guests seemed unhappy. We were told this was unusual, but not much help since this was our one and only visit to this park. We were told by a manager that ""You come to a theme park expecting ride closures"" ??!!! Food lines were long, but food was fine. Refillable drink cup worth it since drinks were pricey. I am sure had the rides actually been working, it would have been fun since coasters looked great, but only got to experience about half of them.",TravelMomOhio2000

40,Buy the Flash Pass,"We bought the Flash Pass which is worth every cent! We managed 15 rides in 4 hours. Without it, we would have struggled to do 4 rides. On one ride (Rapids), the family we shared the ride with had queued for 1 hr 45 mins whereas we walked straight on. Some serious roller coasters - not for the faint-hearted - but plenty of gentler rides too. Get there early before the park opens or expect to take 1 hr between arriving and riding. The Flash Pass works well really well in that it tells you what rides you can go on immediately. Although you have to do is select the ride available on the handset and then go go the ride and more or less walk straight on. The park is quite spread out so lots of walking and some hills. Signage for Flash Pass entry into some rides could be better marked.",C0nners66

30,"Ok, but could be better for solo visitors","Went with the hope (based on previous reviews) that several lines would have single rider queues... But only found one that offered it. Several coasters were closed with no available explanation or idea of when they might reopen. Bathrooms were disgusting - looked like they hadn't been attended to all day. Good things: park itself (aside from bathrooms) was cleaner than expected. Parking was $20 but organized and offered a shuttle to the gate. Warning - you will have to pay to lock up your bags at certain rides, whereas some will let you stash your bag at your own risk on deck while you ride. Seems random which rides enforce the rule and which didn't. Not as nice as Disney parks, but definitely more thrill rides which is why I went. Got discount tickets at a Disney discount ticket seller in Anaheim for $49 for a one day pass. Glad I went, but it wasn't as magical as the competition.",YVRSarah
40,Platinum Flash Pass is the only way!,"The two of us thought for a long time which Flash Pass to buy, ended up deciding on the Platinum. So the cost was: General admission ($47 x 2), Platinum Flash Pass ($125 x 2), X2 add-on ($15 x 2) to a total of $374 for the day. A couple of things to mention about the Platinum Flash Pass: 1) it does not necessarily get you to the front of the line, rather it gets you to the back of the loading lines, where people get distributed into different seat# lines. Also they mentioned that you get to choose which row you want to board, but on Colossus we were not allowed to choose the very front, although on other ones, it was not a problem. 2) it is advertised that with Platinum Pass you can ride twice in a row on some rides. What they don't tell you is this is only true if you are in the middle. They don't allow you to double-ride in the very front or the very back. Overall, we were very satisfied with the experience (if you don't think about the costs that much). We got to go onto every single ride in the park, and did some of them 4-5 times. Almost all of the rides were available right away, the average waiting time once in the queue, was about 6 minutes. The longest time we ever waited in line was 20 min (for Tatsu). It was disappointing that X2 was not included in the Platinum Flash Pass, we had to pay $15 per person additional to get on X2 one time. Also you only get to ride once on Colossus, Full Throttle, and Superman. We made up for it doubling up on other rides. We also discovered two awesome attractions that we never have gotten to on the prior visits without the Flash Pass: Dive Devil and Sling Shot (both at additional fee, but highly worth it!). Having been to the park before, we've already sampled its limited dunning options, so this time around we brought a cooler and went back to the car to have an edible lunch (it was a good break between endless rides as well). Thinking back on the Flash passes, the Gold one is not worth it if you want to get on all the high trill rides (because it does not cover them).",augustjasmine
50,Magical brave heart,"Its worts to wait for every entry , because you will experience something different for each roller coaster, the longest one, the highest, or the most scary one which has plenty turning point up and down and the one you feel like the roller coaster is going to break and fall? All you can try here, i was so scare but its was the most magical experiences in my life, i am not expect that i am so brave. Its a must visit and try all roller coaster for all age but no problem with their health of course!!",Lina Jasin
40,Very good visit,"Being from the other side of the country, roller coaster enthusiasts always want to sample the parks on the west coast since they are difficult as access. The rides at this park are very good. It is more about roller coasters here as the number of flat spinning rides are fewer than the average park. The kiddie land is very nice. The rides seemed to be in excellent working condition.Despite being a Thursday, the park was crowded the first few hours because of all the day care groups. With that being said, line cutting was bad and the lines were long until mid-afternoon when the day care kids left for home. The remainder of the day went well. Re-rides on coasters is allowed if there are empty seats. That is a plus.Overall this is a great park to visit. Season pass holders get 15% off food and merchandise at selected locations in the park. Get an extra 5% back if you use Discover Card.",Amusementparkguy

20,Paid a lot of money to stand around and overpay for food.,"We went on weekday to avoid crowds but lines were still long. We got the $15 free refill cup but the catch is, each time you want a refill, you have to wait in line 20 minutes.The worst wait was probably entering the park because there are no lines, its just a mass of people slowly pushing their way in with the rude people making a lot more progress than anyone else.The ride lines were decent I guess but most rides had teens skipping everyone with no staff around to stop it.There was even a line to LEAVE THE PARK.The prices for food are way too high especially considering you have to wait forever to even order it.I can't imagine what it's like on the weekends!My wife and son got stuck halfway up the Viper for a long period of time on his first trip to an amusement park and only his 2nd roller coaster. ruining the rest of the day for him.They charge separate for bumper cars and rock climbing as well which is ridiculous.",frogger6
50,Totally amazing,"Went here at the beginning of June for a couple of days with my parents as part of our holiday. We loved it. It was very hot hitting 100 degrees on both days we were there. We noticed that a lot of the rides were only running one car or only using half their track (superman), making some of the queues longer than they needed to be. Also I was quite disappointed that goliath was shut but I guess that just gives me an excuse to go back in the future!",Georgina S
40,Great Rides but expensive day,"I pre-purchased a ""Flash Pass"" before attending the park on a Saturday. I was glad I did this as queues for the rides weren't too bad in the morning but were seriously long (100s of people) by mid-afternoon, the Flash Pass resulted in waits for me of only 5 minutes or so. Some of the more extreme rides (Tatsu, Riddlers Revenge) were seriously intense, with high speeds & G-forces. There was an extra charge for the most recently installed thrill ride (X2), this seemed excessive given the additional cost I'd already incurred buting the Flash Pass.Food was also expensive, even small snacks were $15 plus.",PhilbyJ2015
40,All sorts of roller coaster rides,"Not for the weak-hearted I would like to say but they do have a good range of less thrilling rides as well. Suitable for not so young adults who are still adventurous as the variety of roller coasters are amazing which have you standing, flying, flipping and giving the other coaster's riders high-fives. Very long queues - recommend fast passes but DEFINITELY pricey. Go early to get a headstart on the rides to try to finish the most exciting ones at the very least.",messymei
40,"Lots of fun, but very expensive and long lines","The roller coaster rides at this park are great. Be prepared though for long lines, an average of 1 1/2 to 2 hours per ride. We were there from open to close and was only able to get on about half the rides due to lines. We did go on a weekday as suggested, so can only imagine what it would be like on a weekend... It's not cheap and if you don't like thrill roller coasters be prepared to just sit/stand around all day as there isn't anything else to do.",Cheryl
50,My Head is stilll spinning,"if you're lookign for rides this is definitly a great place to go.Tips: We bought the red bottle for drinks and refilled all dayBy 3 pm the park was packed and all rides took a long time, we wished by then that we had taken the flash pass",MaximeSuisse
30,Don t sign the yellow form,"Went there with my son on the 22nd June 2015 just as we got to the ninja ride I stumbled down two steps didn't t ask for assistance -nobody around anyway eventually got some assistance after hobbling around in agony was taken to the first aid place and was promptly given a form to sign to say I didn't t want hospital treatment ,that was ok by me because of the expense but then they gave me a Yellow form to sign DON T sign it ,it s a form that exonerates six flags from any blame for any accident got home on the 3rd of July had my very painfully foot x rayed to find that I had broken the side of my foot also it says on the tickets no refunds I had paid for the water park too but we couldn't t go so after a big fuss they refunded our money ,don t let them fob u off get your money back if u don t use the ticket/and or u have an accident",Caroline H

50,BEST PLACE EVER!!!!!!!!!!,"My sister and I went here last year in the summer and we honestly had the best day of our lives here!!!We got there really early, way before the gates even opened just so we can be the first ones in. And at 10am the gates opened and we were released into roller coaster heaven!We went straight to Full Throttle which was so awesome and it gave us such a buzz! Then we went to Superman twice - and oh my gosh it was so fast!Comparing the roller coasters back here in the UK, Six Flags Magic Mountain has the best rides I have ever seen!The food available is also very nice (bit expensive - especially drinks).Thrill Capital Of The World! Thank you so much for having us!!! We will definitely be back as soon as possible!",Anna-Marie S
30,fantasic rides in not so good park,"Visited with two teenage sons, as avid coaster fans the rides were fantastic.To fully enjoy paid extra for platinum fast pass this is the only way to get to experience all of the big coasters in one day.Prepaid online in UK to take advantage of discounts however paying for fast pass made this the most expensive day out ever.It was very disappointing on arrival having paid so much that the park was charging extra for the X2 coaster,in fact the impression on the day was that the park was trying to extract as much money from you as possible.The only thing you are allowed to take in food and drink wise was water.So guess what food and drink was really expensive.It is a great pity that the money taken from the public was no put to use for cleaning of the toilets which on the whole were disgusting.Fantastic roller coasters not so fantastic park !!!",Ian B
30,Greate rides but also very long lines,"We went with out teenage daughters to Six Flags Magic Mountain in July. The rides were great but the queues were very long.It was very hot but most attractions had some sort of shade for the queue. And that was needed for the queues at most attractions were very long - more than one hour. Unfortunately Six Flags are not very good at providing information about the waiting time at each ride and it is not always possible to see how long the line is.We tried Apocalypso, Goliath, Superman, Scream, The Riddlers revenge, Twisted Colossus, Viper and X2. My favorites were X2 and Twisted Colossus.",Yesba
50,Awesome,The title says it all. A fantastic theme park with some incredible rides especially Tatsu. What an epic rollercoaster. Hardly any wait for the rides with the exception of Superman and a fab day out,The_Lang
50,Roller Coaster Heaven,If you love roller coasters like I love them then Magic Mountain has to be high on your list for a visit. Read some negative reviews in the forum but my experience was anything but negative. We arrived early and opted out of the extra pass to get in earlier. We went midweek as well. The first 3 hours was incredible. short lines for even the best rides. Lines built up during the day and topped out at around an hour. We rode every coaster in the park with the exception of one that was out of service. Perfect day highly recommend.,Hugh M
10,"Terrible Customer Service, Apparently Dangerous Green Lantern Ride","I emailed James W. P. Reid-Anderson CEO of the park, as well as John Bement at Dmccoy@sftp.com, jreidanderson@sftp.com prior to posting this, but received no reply. I suppose customer service isn't high on their list.Customer service is poor. At the front gate, one of the ""loss prevention"" people was rude, discriminatory, and threatening claiming ""we didn't know how much power he had"". Apparently his name is John or Oscar (he refused to give his last name).One goes to a park for a positive experience, and that includes respectful treatment by the staff. The other concern was the Green Lantern ride that apparently had technical issues, but they continued to push people to board. After riding it, I had some issues with my neck and head from the harness and other riders had complained of the same thing.",Jason S

50,Roller Coaster City,"Where do I start. If you like roller coaster this is the place for you. My son and Husband love Roller Coasters and I don't but still had a good time. We booked our tickets online from Australia and upgraded to the normal wait time flash pass. When we got there you have to go to a different area to get your flash pass. As soon as I saw the crowd we upgraded our flash pass immediately to the Gold Flash pass with wait time of 50%. So worth the money in the end. I think the first ride we went on was Tatsu and that did me for about 2 hours but the boys loved it. The Flash Pass was so easy to use just punch in what ride you are after and it beeps when your ride is ready to go to, this allows time to go on other rides or get something to eat. Everything is very pricey food wise but got a six flags drink container for about $20 which my son kept filling with free refills all day. We went on nearly all the rides except X2. The boys went and lined up over the hill while I stood there listening to a guy who said he had just waited 2 hours to get on to X2 and had just got off. Two minutes later the boys came back. No surprise and hour wait at that stage. We drove from Anahiem to get there about a 90 drive quite easy all freeway driving, and a very large car park.",Jo H

50,Roller Coaster Utopia,"First of all, let me say that if you don't like roller-coasters, don't go here, as it will just end up being a waste of time and money. But if you do, you'll probably have the time of your life. The park has many roller-coasters of all different variety. From the GCI wooden coaster Apocalypse to the flying coaster Tatsu, this park has it all. As for the Flash Pass, I'd recommend it purely for Tatsu, but only if it's a busy time of year. And whatever happens, be sure to get there before opening to ride X2 at least once - to say the very least, it's quite the experience, and I recommend NOT watching the POV on youtube. It's best the ride be more surprising.And since this is a Six Flags amusement park, expect bad, overpriced food and hordes of obnoxious teenagers. But those are nothing compared to all the great roller-coasters this park has to offer.",Ethan K
40,Great Theme Park!,This is a very good theme park in California. I have been to theme park across the US including Florida and this one is right up there. I book the tickets through my company website and saved about 20 bucks each ticket. i would recommend to get the fast pass to save time and its worth the money.

20,TERRIBLE Customer Service,"We live in Florida and traveled on vacation to the Los Angeles area. One of the main attractions of our trip was a visit to Magic Mountain this past Monday, July 20. It's not cheap ($20 to park and roughly $42/person AFTER GETTING DISCOUNTED TIX), but we love thrill rides and have been looking forward to this for many months.So the weather was nice, and we arrived at 10:20am, about 10 minutes before the gates opened. At the strike of 10:30am the gates swung open and hoards of parkgoers poured in (as you'd expect on a nice, summer day). What did we find in the ONLY THREE hours we spent there? A tremndous amount of rides, concessions and games closed. On a beautiful, summer day!!!Tatsu (roller coaster) was closed when we swung by at 11am, Superman (coaster) was closed for A WEEK, Lex Luthor's Drop of Doom closed for A WEEK, the Jet Stream (water ride) closed ""until an hour after the park opens"" according to the employee telling us this at noon...90 minutes after the park had opened although the ride hadn't yet, and Tidal Wave (water ride) closed. Aside from not being able to ride some of the better rides at the park, the other ""good"" rides had longer lines that necessary because of it.More than half of the concessions and boardwalk-style games were closed up too. It was depressing!It seems obvious that management is trying to cut corners, yet the prices are the highest they've ever been. The rides, when open, may be fun. But Magic Mountain is NO LONGER worth the trip.",Sarah A
50,Awesome!,Six Flags is always a good time in my book. Service is scattery but overall experience is fun. I went back in January so some rides were closed but I am going back soon to try out the new coaster!!,smashley7
50,Incredible and doesn't get boring!!!,"I went in 2008 and I loved it, I went on a family holiday and we didn't decide that we were going to go there for one of the days but instead we changed our plans and so happy we went, I loved it, I'm a huge fan of coasters and heights so this was a really great place to go to! The food was amazing too, didn't have to line up for too long, just like a general line. I would say a good thing about the park was that there was smoking areas which meant if you smoked you had restricted ares near the gates of the park so non smokers don't and didn't have to worry about their children getting smoke in their faces..it's not nice! But overall it was an amazing holiday and would love to go back!!!!",JuliaInnes
50,So much fun,Just awesome. Great coasters. Had a blast even on a 110 degree day. The fast pass thing is totally worth it too.,jsmoo1
50,Six flags magic mountain,I have been visiting this park for over 8 years now and I have to say it is the best! They recently added or better yet reinvented one of their roller coasters and it is a must when visiting the park. There are so many rides to choose from and you can be sure you will have a great time. The employees are very helpful and the park is clean. I can't wait to go back ! :),lizettegarcia92
50,Get the Flash Pass,"We used the platinum flash pass and wow did it work great. We did not wait for one ride and went on every ride that the pass offered. We had a excellent time at the park, food is expensive, but we expected that. We would defiantly go to the park again.",CNG2005
40,The Theme Park for Roller Coaster Fans.,"I've been here more times than I can remember and have always enjoyed myself. The lines can be long but they have an optional (additional cost) fast pass if you want to spend the money.Make sure to ride Goliath, Batman, and Tatsu. Avoid Apocalypse (formerly cyclone) as it is really jerky and I guarantee back/neck pain. If you don't enjoy roller coasters you really shouldn't bother going because this is a big thrills roller coaster park. Oh, and wear comfortable shoes, this is a big park and you'll be walking a lot.",Chris P
30,Mediocre amusement park.,"When compared to a higher class of amusement park like universal studios, this park falls short of fun. The lines are not too long but take forever to get up to the rise itself. 1hr on average. The Superman ride was 5 seconds of extreme Rollercoaster fun but hardly worth the wait and cost of admission. Also, there aren't any fans or misters to help with the heat, and minima all shade to protect yourself from the blistering heart and sun. If none of that discourages you, then come on down. I'll take my next trip to the beach instead.",SqueakFro
20,Six Flags Magic Mountain,"The park was packed to begin with, our bags were searched for food & drinks ( they were removed & thrown away). The park tickets were basic and to get on the rides in on day you needed to purchase a flash pass which was at an additional cost. Initially on booking we thought the water park on the same site was covered by our ticket - it wasn't, we had to pay even more money out to get in. The queues were large it was extremely hot and we struggled to find any available beds to lay on. Again there were additional charges outside of the initial entrance fee to obtain equipment needed to use the rides. Our group of 4 split up as my youngest son did not feel well and we hoped that going into the water park would provide him with somewhere to rest - how wrong I was. The visit to this park has been the most disappointing and irritating of any theme park & water park we have ever visited. Only one person in our party enjoyed the theme park three did not - money well wasted in my opinion, if you want your eyes taken out this is the place to visit!",Angela G
40,Many coasters!,"My family of 5 was here on July 6. It was my 17 y/o only request on our LA vacation. We were bummed Goliath wasn't running but we enjoyed all the other coasters. We didn't have any more than probably a 45 minute wait for the top rides. Some of the older rides are less exciting and more rough, may be time for those to be replaced. There is a lot of walking here. Biggest complaint is every food service worker was very slow. This park doesn't have the character and theming and attention to detail that Disney or Universal have and isn't as clean and neat as the Cedar Fair and Busch Gardens parks that we have been to have but it appears they are trying in the area of the newer rides. There is shade in all the queue lines and the mountain views are fabulous. Twisted Colossus and Full Throttle were favorites.",Cheryl H

50,Get ready for an adventure of life time,"We went in the first week of June 2015.There are nearly 40+ rides neatly segmented from thrill seekers (read extreme rides) to rides for starters.We went on a weekday and I am told that saved us a lot of time standing in long queues. We didn't experience the so told long waits. Max. we waited for a ride was 30 minutes. Though we felt we were old in the company of gangs of pre-teens and teens. But it was fun.I liked the fact that the park is all about rides and to that extent it is a no non sense park. If you love your body to get churned around in all imaginable moves. this is the place to be. I always though roller coasters are all about getting into a little capsule and you sit upright and then you go round the track at fast speed. Till I sat in Tatsu (one of the rides is called by this name) where you are hanging like a dog ....I liked the fact that all rides have a some sort of a story (world's oldest, to world's fastest to world's longest loop etc.). Most of the extreme rides have one or the other super hero relationship and we loved it. The names leave you with a lasting story - Viper, X2, Full Throttle ....World's fastet ride is called ""Escape from Krypton"" with a superman theme built in.Our favourite was Lex Luthor's Drop of Doom. Experience free fall from 300 fits after hearing Lex's scorn.My 7 year old could not get on some rides because he missed the height criteria by couple of inches. If you are 52"" and taller you will get though most of the rides.There is a lot of theatre in the rides. The recently added ride - Full Throttle has a nice suspense ..The park takes its rides very seriously. So buckle up. Surely the park is not for the faint hearted.If you are upto spicing up and shaking off the lethargy.. This is the place to be.",node75
50,Awesome day at Magic Mountain,"This first paragraph is the short version of our day at Six Flags. We went on a Tuesday and the lines we're not that bad. To give you an idea, we got on 10 rides (some multiple times) in 10 hours -and we didn't upgrade to the Flash Pass options. The weather was in the low 90's (if you come any time June-September make sure you bring hats, sun block and drink plenty of water all day long). The employees and other park attendees were pleasant. The grounds were kept in decent order of cleanliness. It was a super fun day for our party of five (mom, dad, two 11 year olds and a 16 year old). It was worth every penny we spent.Read on if you want all the Geeky details of the rides and our recommendations on how to save some money at the park.Our savings started by purchasing the seven day advance online tickets (saved $25 per ticket). I paid the $20 parking fee online and printed the voucher. That didn't cost less by getting it in advance but it saved time when we pulled up -they simply scanned the paper and we drove in less than 10 seconds.I also bought one refillable sports bottle for $15.99. This definitely paid for itself. Since the park allows you to bring a water bottle inside, I put one in my backpack. Throughout the day we refilled the bottles many times. Each time I poured the drink from the sports bottle into my water bottle, passed that around to my family and then had the sports bottle filled up again. This system worked great. Saved us lots of money and it was easy.If you don't like drinking a lot of carbonated, sugar filled beverages you can ask for half lemonade and half filtered water. I prefer drinking mostly water. I found that the taste of the water that came out of most of the public water fountains tasted horrible (like chlorine). They did have good tasting, filtered water at the soda fountains and the first aid station however. What I ended up doing was ask for a free cup of water when ever I stopped to have the sports bottle filled.Along with sipping water on the hot summer days you should definitely bring sun block and a hat. I bought a SPF 50 cloth baseball hat that actually folds up and fits inside my pocket. That came in handy when going on rides because some of them go so fast it is nearly impossible to not lose it. Side note: on this trip my son got hit on the mouth by someone's hat while that flew off while riding on the Viper. It hit him below the front teeth and lacerated his gum -not fun.The official park policy is that no outside food or drinks (besides water) are allowed in. I called the park and asked if we could bring sandwiches and was told -no outside food/drinks so we stopped and ate a big breakfast before entering the park. There are lots of restaurants close by. When we got to the park our bags were searched for weapons, contraband and who knows what else, but they didn't seem to care about the apple that snuck its way in my bag. Oops. They also said nothing about the non-park-purchased smoothie I was sipping as they searched our stuff. Throughout the day I saw plenty of people enjoying their 'outside' food -families happily passing around sandwiches and fruit. Next time I go back we will definitely bring food in a separate back pack, rent a locker and leave it tent for when we get hungry.When researching and planning our day at the park I wished we could afford to buy the flash passes because I know first hand that the lines can be very long to get on the rides. But they were just too expensive for our budget (additional $70 per person). We were pleasantly surprised that the lines weren't really that long.Here are the rides we went on and the number of times we rode them (not in any particular order):X2 (2 times), Superman (2 times), Revolution (3 times), Drop of Doom, Apocalypse (2 time), Full Throttle, Green Lantern, Tatsu, Viper, Jet Stream (2 times).If you are determined to upgrade to the Flash Pass, I strongly recommend going to the park, seeing for yourself if it was even necessary and then purchase it there. I would have been very sad if I went ahead and spent the $280 ok five passes only to arrive at the park and find out they weren't necessary or helpful.Our favorite rides were X2, Full Throttle, Tatsu and Green Lantern.X2 is known as a fifth dimension coaster because they use music, voice recordings, lighting and fire to mess with your head on the ride. The entire experience of this ride was fun, exciting, terrifying all at the same time. This is my all-time favorite ride.My least favorite ride was the Apocalypse. If you are a coaster 'purist' you will be enamored by the fact that it is made of all wood but the ride is extremely bumpy and jerked me around the entire ride. I would not wait to get off.I brought a small first aid kit (that included head ache pain reliever) in my backpack. That came in handy once or twice during the day.If you find this review helpful please give me a 'Thumbs Up'",TravelJunkySoCal

50,Awesome visit at Six Flags,"Went with family on July 11, 2015. It was a Saturday and it was packed. We invested in the platinum flash pass. Yes, it is expensive, but we have tried all levels and this is the best. We never waited more than 8 minutes to get on a ride. We did all rides before 6 pm twice. If you are going to the park, I highly recommend it. No waiting in long lines in the hot sun. We spoke with people who had been there the same amount of time and had only ridden on 3 rides. Save your money and do it the right way. So much more enjoyable.",Foxey43

30,Love this place wish I could give it a 5 Star,"Magic Mountain, the extreme roller coaster lovers playground. My wife and I on a whim decided to take our 10 year old and 14 year old to Magic Mountain for the first time on our way home from somewhere else. I have been coming to Magic Mountain for a very long time and used to purchase a season pass each year.My first small shock was the sticker price of $72.99 per person. Wow! That is double what I last paid just 6 years ago. But luckily due to my employment I was able to get my tickets half off. PHEW!On to the park. I notice that since I was last there more people are coming to the park which is great! There had been rumors of the park closing many years ago so I'm really happy to see it growing.The basics...The rides were awesome of course. Can't say enough about Twisted Colasaus, the new Superman change of how you sit, Full Throttle was amazing and X2...wow. So they have the ride itself down to an absolute science, keep it up!The bad...this is what brought my rating to a 3 because these things really affect your trip.1. Lines - Yes i realize as more people come into the park the lines become longer. Expect that, and I am totally fine with that. However, when I see that things don't have to be as bad as they are it is very frustrating. On several rides, on a Saturday they only had 1 side open! I was shocked by this. The park was packed! Why in the world would both sides of popular rides not be open on a busy Saturday? Prime example, Superman. Ride wait time from entrance said 15 minutes. SWEET! Too good to be true. As soon as we got in line and were standing there for 20 minutes everyone realized that only 1 side is going up. A couple workers come out to set up line directors and after being asked they say that they are working on opening the other side. Next question, oh is it broken? Answer, No. Once they finally got it open the line was very quick but why not have it open to begin with to keep the line moving and get people to other rides? We saw this on several rides but they didn't open another side on those.2. The food - We experienced only 1 side of the food areas being open as well, resulting in ridiculous lines for food.3. Price for Food - Holy Smokes! $10 for a slice of pizza? Really? We don't think that's a little bit of a ridiculous amount? $13 for Panda Express that is usually $5? C'mon Six Flags. I never even saw a budget friendly option, maybe I missed it in all fairness but I sure as heck couldn't find it and didn't see any documentation pointing to it.Bottom line...I think the management of the park needs some attention to take care of the customers. While everyone is there to ride great rides they also want to enjoy the downtime between rides. It's nice to be able to buy fun things for your kids and not have to spend every dime to do it. We passed by a lot of stuff because of the high prices. We noticed that the bathrooms were not in the best shape. All of these little things are a result of poor management and could be fixed to make this park a 5 star park easily. I hope that Magic Mountain sees these and makes some changes because they are noticed and do sway decisions to visit that park or others in the area of which there are plenty.",Jeff C
20,Not a very nice experience from the get go....,"Only one tram is available and it only travels once in a while. The parking area is a very long walk to the gate. It seemed to be about a half mile or so. The walk is all up hill so you are winded by the time you get to the gates where you have to wait in line (AGAIN) for our Go L.A. tickets. Don't bring anything in (food, snacks, etc...) or else it gets taken away. You then have to go stand in line again to get the pre purchased drink cup. No one seemed to know where to get that item activated and the walk around staff is not helpful either. Seems like every attraction is up hill and I mean UP HILL! No train to get around the park like other Six Flags parks. The map is a joke. The actual distances from ride to ride is forever. Older people will hate this place and the kids wanted to go home after a short time. No shows available like other Six Flags parks. No shaded areas and the restaurants (Katy’s Kettle) have no air conditioned areas to sit and eat. The food was bad and the sodas were extremely expensive. We ate chicken strips that were more batter than chicken. Fries were bad too. No service, everyone was ""busy."" The staff behind the counter kept taking breaks so that 40 people in line had to wait for 30 minutes just to get their order taken. The kids behind the counter looked bored and angry. No one looked to be in charge. Seriously need to get adults to run the place. The food is no cheaper on line so don't waste your time buying it there. The printed coupons just make you wait in line to get verified and approved. Waste of time when I realized that the prices were the same in the park. Six Flags gets your money quicker and they make you stand in line which wastes more attraction time for the kids. The lines to the rides are another matter. To many people and not enough rides. No place for adults who simply want to see a show and rest. This park was a major let down. Getting your drink cup refilled is another 15 minute wait since none of the vendors seemed to want to be there. Everyone looked mad and hot.",20BigAL14
50,Awesome Day of Thrills,Want to go outside your comfort zone ! Unbelievable roller coasters . Definitely worth paying extra for the xpress passes. We paid $70 for 2 and it was a hand held device for our party of 4 so we could all have a go. If you paid the $100 each you get a wrist band per person so it would have cost us $400 extra on top of the entry fees . Awesome day and thoroughly recommend it for families of teens with adventurous spirit,Kylie T
40,There's rollercoasters...What's not to like?,I was looking forward to this for my entire trip in the US and it certainly delivered. The only downside to it was that we spent over $100 on the fast pass which wasn't really necessary. The second best fast pass would have done just fine. Nonetheless Six Flags was great!,Julian B
30,Six Flags Magic Mountain,"Family oriented hotel, breakfast included, reasonable prices. The room was really great for taking two fussy teenaged boys along who do Not want to share a bed or even a room. Located. Lose by to local attractions. Would recommend to other families on vacation on the west coast.",Elizabeth E
40,I love magic mountain,Only issue is the food. Its overpriced and below standards. And also the closed rides seems to always be the same ones.,Jose Alonso C
50,Great for thrillseekers; coaster lovers.,"This is one of the most awesome parks i´ve visited. I´m a BIG roller coaster fan and this is my favorite park so far. my favorite coasters here are the X2, TATSU, COLOSSUS, GOLIATH, VIPER (a classic), FULL THROTTLE, BATMAN AND SCREAM.This time i visited with my 9 year old son, who´s also a thrill seeker and he just loved all the rides. We used the FLASH PASS thing, and it worked great; it´s a great way to schedule your rides and saves you a ton of time.",JORGE_CARR
50,Love it and the kids love it too,We enjoyed visiting here. We will definitely come back here since 1 day is not enough to totally enjoy this attraction.,Nebz22
30,Not quite!!,"I cannot give them better than average, too much walk and too many lines, Last time I visited a six flags was the fiesta Texas in San Antonio 3 years ago, I don't know the prices right know, but this one was expensive, a lot of rides, I hate to pay for a ride inside a park when I paid for the entrance already and I cannot ride the go cars, they have an extra charge, this is a no go, and I didn't pay for the water park in San Antonio or Dallas.",bansterref
50,Great roller coasters recommend this place,Best Coasters in the west. No other park in southern California can compare with the rides. The parking lot sucks as so do the out dated trams. They look like crap and nothing great about smelling propane as u take the free 2 min ride to the front. Sheriff has a substation there so not sure if it is safe but had no problems when i went,LMTOWINC
30,Great thrill rides/kids ride but no entertainment on weekdays and horrible customer service,"First the bad, this park could be so much better with management/employees that care. The management of lines to get into the park is horrible, a 20 min wait to get in (after going through the line for the metal detectors) and no control/direction of the lines despite customer service reps circulating outside the park. The lines at Disney are quicker. Beware of lines that bottleneck into a single turnstiles when there are also individual lines for individual turnstiles that move much quicker. Appears there is no entertainment during the week which the web site does not state and employees are clueless as several told me there was entertainment (was hoping to see the Cirque type show) and got five different answers from Park employees on where I could get or see a copy of the entrainment schedule to include visiting customer service. Never did see one and tried to call customer service with no joy (also never got a reply from the email I submitted to website) Not one employee I asked told me there was no entertainment the day we visited but there was a sign on the theater for the cirque style show stating it was on weekends. Also many lines for rides seemed short based on the amount of space set aside to wait and the amount of people in line but these were misleading due to either parts of the ride being closed or other issues.The good, if you like thrill rides, this park has 'em and there are different levels. Also the kids rides in Bugs Bunny World are good with little to no wait and there are 3-4 kids roller coasters. The multi-level mesh net Looney Tunes Lodge has soft foam balls to throw and shoot with air cannons and is fun for younger kids and adults. My girls 5-8 loved the area and we had to drag them away. There are also Looney Tunes character meets and greets (of note, some kids rides never opened with no explanation, just no one to run the rides). The train ride, just outside of Bugs Bunny World has seen much better days when it was Thomas the Train Engine ride",Headhunter2001
50,scarey and fast coaster,"Short lines, tons of shade in lines, and fast scarey coasters!!! Drink deals were awesome. We payed 30 dollars for 3 people and drank soda and power aid all day for that price.",kincaidzach
40,Whoah!,If you are short of time be prepared to spend some money on the flash pass so you are able to get on the rides. We ended up spending the max so we could get on the rides we wanted. It was totally worth it for us as we are unlikely to go back given we are in NZ. Great for the thrill seeker. Loved Full Throttle and Superman ride. Twisted Collossus was good fun too. Recommend a minimum of 4 hours to get a decent number of rides under your belt.,familywithinfant
50,The most fun night of my life!,"Six Flags was sooo cool! I haven't been to any of the others, but this park rocked! We were so lucky to be in the park during Halloween, so the park changed from being a family park in daytime, to a frightfest at night. I really recommend going to this park in October when they're doing the fright fest. They had pumpkin pie and there were concerts and people (monsters), who went around in the park scarying people. So spooky! Also, be shure to have a map. The park is huge!!",Natalie H
50,Best Theme Park Hands Down,"If you're looking for the best bang for your buck and the best roller coasters, Magic Mountain is the place for you. We love going here way more than Disneyland. It's a whole park full of the big, exhilarating type of coasters - real rides and not silly little kid rides - although if you have little ones, there's plenty for them as well. We always went by ourselves until our kids were all grown up a bit more. Then we bought them all season passes once they all hit 52-54"".",tiffunny4
50,I love Magic Mountain,"C'mon, who doesn't know about Magic Mountain? Well, if you don't, you need to experience it (if you like big and fast amusement rides). I remember my last time there. Arrived early morning, still half asleep with Starbucks in hand trekking up the way to ride X. It is one hell of a way to kickstart an early morning. Just thinking about it makes my heart pound. I need to go back. It has been too long.",Ivan M
30,Bad hair day at Six Flags,"If you like classic rides I guess this is the place. But for me and my family this wasn't the perfect day since some of the attractions were closed or late (in repair) for that day. We got there early (40 min before opening) to be able to skip queues but couldn't take advantage. The service and logistics are not at as good as at Universal for instance. We stood in line for an attraction for over 50 minutes being passed Fast-Pass-customers several times. And the ride had empty seats every ride.But there are some good points too. Some of the rides are really special and for the daring ones. My children had some issues with the shaking in some of the rides. Since they are a bit old (the rides) and my children are short. The food is affordable and drinks too. Would be great with some more trees for some shadow. This day was a hot one.I would go to Universal if given the chance. But then again, maybe this was just a bad hair day for Six Flags. I can't really tell. The price is ok for this attraction though, if all is up and running that is.",Martin Odman
40,Thrills,"A fun amusement park to go to if you love roller coasters! There are a variety of coasters there to choose from. Personally when it is hot, I like the water rides. Admonish ion prices are in line with amusement parks....staff is okay...seems to be a park for the younger set....",Cherie P
50,Fun at Six Flags,"Our first visit to one of the best parks in the entire world. Magic Mountain has some of the best coasters around and a great variety of rides. Admission price was comprable to other parks that are like it . Although I am a Cedar Fairfan, Six Flags is a great day.",Coastal582484
50,Twisted Colssus is worth the Trip!,"Pure excitement, smooth, fast, exhilarating! When you think the ride is over- the best part is ahead! We loved the green track the best. This ride is completely worth the wait and both my son and I felt very secured even though there was no chest harness. Six Flags gets a gold star for this one!",TravelinMom2012
30,"Amazing thrill rides, surly staff","Loved all the rides, went on a tuesday and didn't even have to queue very long. It was hot though and so those free top up cups are a must! however the food and be staff move at about 1mph so expect to be waiting lots. They were so miserable not one person smiled. The rest of the park is a bit of a downfall, there is no clear ""theme"" and lacks serious personality. They could learn a lot from Universal and Disney. But I guess the reason people go here are for the rides and thats where this place excels!",j0annemcc
40,Some great coasters,Had a great time there riding numerous coasters from the fast rocket style superman to the metal loop style stuff. Bets coasters in Central California and better for families with older kids.,thegreathawaiian
50,Intense thrills for adrenaline junkies,"Six Flags Magic Mountain is a thrill seekers heaven. There are plenty of rollercoasters to ride that will definitely fill your adrenaline needs. The best coaster by far is the Twisted Collosal rollercoaster. A must for Thrill seekers. A Rollercoaster that weaves within itself and has you running in parallel with another train. If you are going to Magic Mountain make sure you ride this coaster. Also if it is the busy season I would recommend you also get the flash pass which allows you to access a faster line. Next time I visit, I will surely get the flash pass.",Ridgy Didge
10,Over filled and over flowing,"My partner and I attended the park during the recent holiday period knowing it would be a bit busier than normal, however our much anticipated day was met with disappointment after disappointment.After attending both Disneyland and Knotts Berry Farm we expected some wait times and had been advised by friends that a flash pass was a must. We prebooked what we thought were entry tickets and a flash pass only to latter learn that for the $170 out laid we had only bought parking and the flash pass, tickets not included and were later asked to pay another $140 at the gate!Arriving shortly after 1pm we sat in bumper to bumper traffic for over an hour before finally getting a park in what was clearly an overflow park. We then walked over a one kilometre in searing heat (there was a shuttle bus, however the lines exceeded the buses capacity twofold)to the gate, were signage for persons with prebooked tickets was missing in its entirety.After sorting out the ticketing, being bounced between three desks, I would highly recommend that you print you tickets before arriving as the ticket collection office was a thirty minute line in itself and the first of many for the day.Upon entry we sought the assistance of a park employee as to where to pick up the flashpass only to be directed to the 20minute queue for purchasing them not the online collection section which had no line at all. Approaching 330pm we were finally ready to find our first ride. Selecting the batman ride with our first flashpass choice, it gave us a twenty minute wait to proceed to the ride, we eagerly set off to find another ride to line for in the mean time, only to be greeted with line after line advising of wait times in excess of 60minutes. Deciding to move straight to our first flash pass we arrived on time, lined and ride with ease, as thousands of people waited patiently in line behind us. The flash pass then allowed us to choose a second ride ""The Riddler"". And the flash pass this time gave us a wait time of 60 minutes, indicating the wait time for those with the pass had a wait time in excess of 2hours. Again we set off to queue only to line up for 30minutes to arrive at a sign that advised us it was a further 60minute wait time from that sign. In the searing heat and dripping with sweat we set off for customer service in the hope of a refund as after nearly 3 and a bit hours we had only achieved one 60 second ride. Again at customer service we lined with others having a similar experience, before being told no refunds or partial refunds were available and that all we could be offered was a drink and a line pass for two rides, not including the most popular ones. We accepted as this appeared to be our only option.We stayed for the next three and a half ours and managed a total of 6 rides, probably last a total of 8 minuets combined. We walked and checked out all the rides and there queue times some extending up to three hours!Rough calculations meaning that per ride per minute I was paying around $26 for the experience not including the $4.50 to buy a bottle of water on a 35 degree day.On the positive the rides we went on were fantastic, and the rides we could only watch due to the one, two or three hour wait times looked even more amazing!I take my hat off for the American public and tourists that displayed amazing patience and persistence to line in the sun for such long periods. I only but hope it wasn't just because they had out laid hard saved money on a rare trip that they were unlikely to do for a long time to come.Whilst taking my hat off to those that queued I would implore they to complain and review as they see fit, because wait times in excess of an hour are a joke! I would happily wait 45minutes for a new and exciting ride. However simple math reveals how unfair the park was to those who attended that day, even if the wait times had just been 1 hour per ride anyone staying for 8 hours would have only managed 7 rides maximum if only allowing for walking time alone, with no food or toilet breaks (as they to had significant lines for the ladies)!It was a total disappointment and unfortunately it is a management created disappointment, or I should say mismanagement created disappointment.I would recommend Knotts Berry Farm any day of the week for a more affordable and enjoyable day. Disney is busy but far better managed.Pick up your game Six Flags!",Keith T
50,Celebrate 4th of July,"Had a great time with hubby and my daughter. I recommend flash pass to get through the lines quicker. Husband taped out at Scream ( Big guy couldn't handle the loops). Enjoyed their picnic dinner in the pavilion (fried chicken, cole slaw, baked beans, hot dogs, watermelon, ice cream and soda). The laser light and fireworks show was a perfect way to end 4th of July. We felt we didn't miss a thing on this holiday weekend. The concert with DJ Rick Rocks was awesome, my 13 year old was out there dancing in a massive crowd, I felt safe at this family environment. Everyone was having so much having fun. Great job Magic Mountain!",Ileana P
10,2 hour wait times! Absolutely ridiculous,"We arrived at Six Flags at 1pm and it took us an hour to get from the entrance through to the car park due to such heavy traffic. We had pre booked parking and tickets to save time and money, neither was true for the car park. We were placed in an overflow car park and then had to walk about a kilometre and a half to get to the entrance gates.Upon getting through security and trying to enter the park I was told my prepaid pass was a ""flash pass"" only and did not actually get me entry. $140 for two people and I couldn't get in! After exiting the security area and back out to the ticket booths I was advised it would cost another $73 per person to enter. The cashier was quite helpful and gave us a ""coca-cola"" discount of $20 each due to our situation which was great, but still very frustrating to be paying $260 for two people to go to a park for a day!When we got in finally, we then had to queue in another line to collect the flash pass. It was now 3.30pm and had taken us 2 and a half hours to even think about going on a ride! We promptly booked ourselves into a ride and had 20 minutes before our allocated time, it took us almost the whole 20 minutes to walk over to it as the park was so big, and so crowded. After getting on the ride we booked ourselves onto another. Our wait time was an hour, bearing in mind that is 50% shorter than the average wait time for this ride due to our pass! We went to line up for another only to be told that was a 2 hour wait! As we wandered the park we noticed each ride was a minimum 90 minutes and the most popular (which you can't use a flash pass for) we averaging about 3 hours or more!!To say we were disappointed is an understatement. We requested a refund after suffering some mild heat stroke from standing in the sun and only being able to get on 1 ride in 4 hours but were advised this was not possible, we were instead given 2 x front of line passes and 2 x drink vouchers. In the end and only because of the front of line passes on top of the flash pass we managed to get on 6 rides in 6 hours.One of the main rides (Golliath) was shut down, the X2 and Twisted Colossus rides were both at least a three hour wait. Superman was 2 hours (the ride lasts 30 seconds)....ABSOLUTELY NOT WORTH THE TIME OR MONEY.It's disgusting that they can allow that amount of people in and that those times are acceptable. Go to Knott's Berry Farm instead! Much quieter with equally good rides. If you do go here, pay for the 90% faster Platinum pass. If you're forking out that amount of cash, go a little more and actually get on the rides. All in all.... Massively disappointed, I would never waste my money on it or recommend it to friends.",MadaleneBritten
40,Uncrowded and inexpensive,"Let me start off by saying that I haven't been to Magic Mountain in 15 years. Two days ago, I went with my 9 year old daughter, 12 year old son and 13 year old Godson. I have been a Disneyland devotee forever, and I understand the divide. People tend to be staunchly one or the other. But, I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised at how uncrowded it was. We went on a Thursday in the summer and there was zero wait until about 3:30 and then it was only about a 10 minute wait. My son loved every ride and the scarier the better. The only critique I have is that I wish the employees had a little more information for us. My daughter is right at 54"" inches so she was just at the point to ride everything. We like Viper though it banged our heads a little much. That's a 54"" ride. We went on the Lux Luthor drop. Phenomenal. I think that's a 52"" inch ride. We asked about X2 a 48"" ride. We were just told she was tall enough and would have fun. Nope. It was rough and she was terrified and I felt bad that we went on that. It messes with your senses, shakes the heck out of you, flips you all over the place and really makes you think you will fall out and fall to your death. With that said, I think some of the small analysis of rides on the maps are a bit off. My son went on everything and said X2 was the roughest. So, just be forwarned...But overall, we had a fantastic time. There were plenty of rides that were roller coasters and that we loved like revolution and again Viper was really cool. Tidal wave and roaring Rapids kept us cool (though the water is pretty murky and stinky. I forgave it though considering how inexpensive the trip was.)The park is also very reasonable which I was concerned about before heading over. A small souvenir ring for my daughter at Disneyland was $42.00. But everything at Magic Mountain was (more than you would pay anywhere else) but very reasonable for a theme park. I love the capes they sell now and they are as low as $6.00 a piece. We had a full meal for $12.00 and oh my gosh the funnel cakes are incredible.There was a lot to do and my kids were all worn out and asleep for the ride back to the valley. Two days later they are still talking about it.Thank you, Magic Mountain for some great memories.",a_half_and_half
40,Lines Were Long But Worth It!,"So lines were really long EVERYWHERE! The Food was expensive! But for every line for a ride, TOTALLY WORTH IT! I feel the need to say that they really care for your safety. Like if you already feel comfortable they make you feel even more!P.S. I think why it was full was because of the fourth of JulyP.S.S. If you're a screamer, Go On TATSU! Also, go on X2 Because when you're on it you feel like you are about to fall of but you can't",Emmanuel G
40,Fun Family Day,"Took the kids and had an amazing time. Bad luck that we went on a day that where the temperature was 106, but that's not their fault. Every employee we encountered was friendly, polite, and helpful. Look out for the new Twisted Colossus -- left my kids speechless!!!",Brana F
40,Improved and Fun,"We went to Six Flags two to three times a year raising our four boys and loved most of it until the facility became run down and dirty and dangerous enough not to let the boys go on their own. I'm happy to say Six Flags listened to our comments and after ten years we returned at the request of our now 28 year old son. Took three of the boys and had a blast. The place is cleaned up, safe and the new rides are smooth and exciting. The old roller coasters bring back great memories but about killed our necks and backs. No lines on the old coasters however. The crowds were smaller than we remembered with the lines being not so bad. Monday is a great day to go. We would have liked a bit more entertainment and having a printed schedule of the shows rather than a reference to their website but we just did a bit of planning at the beginning of the day. Parking is easy, a bit pricey but within the norm of entertainment venues. We loved the day. Six Flags California is back and we are happy about that.",pepperjack56
20,Much potential,"The rides are good, but when I went I had to stand in line for two hours for X2 only for it to shut down right before I was about to ride. The staff didn't offer us ANYTHING!! That was VERY disappointing. I mean, they could have gotten us a no-wait voucher for it or another ride, but nothing.",letsdothis1

20,Crazy lines artificially inflated,"Visited June 24. Every ride took an hour or more to ride, but the park wasn't crowded. The park only ran one coaster on almost all rides even though multiples were available. This made all the lines huge. On Superman the ride, they average 10 minutes or more for each run. It was constantly having mechanical problems. A 20oz coke is $4:50 (What!). That is the highest I have ever seen. Most airports are at $3. Once we got on the rides they were great, but we didn't get to ride all of them due to the lack of service. I believe you would have a better time at Universal or Sea World, we did. Overall, very disappointed.",Jus4kxs
40,Good,"I used to come here quite often as a kid. So, now that my own children are teenagers, I decided to enjoy this place again. I purchased the season pass because it is well worth the money and very affordable. You could easily get your money's worth in about two to three visits. This place is not overly crowded like it used to be in the past. However, the most popular rides could be as long as a two hour wait. We rode on Full Throttle in the day and at night. The night ride was much more fun. I got on Viper and I do not enjoy that ride. It is very rough and you bang your head a lot, so you end up with a headache. If you ride, make sure you take off your earrings!!! One down side to this park is that there were a few good rides closed without any prior notification to let the public know.",christinamcneely
10,No magic here,"Having been to many theme parks only one word describes our experience and that is disappointing. It is a very hot place with little shade and the queues are significant. We made the mistake of believeing the time indicators for how long you need to wait but they would be accurate for Dr Who in the Tardis - double them and you'll be close. That also assumes that after waiting a considerable time you aren't told that the ride has broken down so the wait was futile.This park is only for rollercoaster devotees who like to be bumped, shaken and stirred and if you go make sure you pay the extra the leeches want for an express pass as it will triple or quadruple the number of rides you'll have as you pass the unwary who have to queue for over an hour for any of the high energy rides.Worst Theme park I've been too by a long way.",Phillip B
40,"Great park, tons of roller coasters, the new twisted colossus is a 4 minute ride",went there on a Sunday in June. It was hot but they had some shady spots and minsters everywhere. If you get too hot go to the full throttle sports bar. It is fully air conditioned with good food and drinks. The new twisted colossus is an incredible 4 minute ride. Full throttle is a quick ride but great too. Bring sun screen and buy water.,atlagunabeach

10,AVOID THIS PLACE!!! RIP OFF!!!,"This place is a disgrace.. We paid nearly $500 for 2 people for the day. Entry, flash pass, food, water, cab ride..Upon arrival were told nothing about rides not working.. We got there at open time and went up to superman as there were minimal lines.. Got told it's not opened, malfunctioned.. When's it open? Not sure.. Ok.. Off to tatsu, walked down to that.. Same story there's a malfunction it's closed. ( happened 3 times throughout the day.. That's right, you line up for an hour only to be told the rides not working..Went to x2 booked it in our flash card for 40 mins, waited and got up there.. Sorry X2 is closed.. Malfunction... Stayed closed for 5 hours, we left so not sure if it reopened..There were two other rides that weren't working.. There's nothing to tell you online or at the front which rides aren't working..The park is generally filthy.. Food is a rip off, water is $5 a bottle, staff are rude and in helpful.We complained to management. NO refunds are given under any circumstances..This place uses false advertising in displaying rides that constantly break down and obviously lack maintenance..AVOID it..",Danmac109
40,Fun day out,"Make sure you pre purchase tickets, get there as the gates open! We also purchased the fast pass. So glad, if you can afford it, do it... The whole day would have been so long and drawn out otherwise!!The map is a little hard to read... So just walk/run!",Melbournecouple2

50,"Great theme park, but busy","If I ever go back, I am getting the flash pass because the queues were ridiculous. After Universal Studios with a front of line pass and Disneyland single rider lines, I wasn't expecting hour long waits for [almost] every ride. I bought a ticket online but was unable to print and lined up initially at the ticket booth for about 30 minutes and then the lady said I had to go to a different ticket booth, which took another 45 minutes. The first ride we went on (Full Throttle) had a wait time of 45 minutes. The lines were just crazy. While we were lining up for Twisted Colossus, the ride broke down, but we stayed in the queue and ended up waiting about 1.5-2 hours before both trains were running again (they put on train on, but then tested and added the second). Anyway, I was very thirsty and running out of water by the time we got to the turnstiles, but they let me go to the drink machine to get some water. Some rides had decent wait times so I managed to ride 11 rides (the only high thrill ones I missed were Goliath as it was closed and Green Lantern because we didn't get time). Overall I thought it was awesome and loved the rides, but those queues (and the heat) were killer.",mightysparks
40,"Exciting rides, affordable","This theme park has the most rides in the world. It suffers from som problems with the individual rides, and some roller coasters are so popular that the waiting time is hardly worth it. However, we were there on a very busy day, and we had no problems finding fantastic rides with short waiting times. Useful tip: use discount offers (found on Coke cans), get a discount by buying more than 3 days in advance on their website.",basskornett

That said...sadly, I'm not able to enjoy the rides like I did as a kid. (X2 almost klled me...lol...never wanted to get off a coaster so badly).We went on a Monday hoping the crowds were low...but it was the first Monday after school let out and it felt really busy...some rides were an hour wait.Goliath was closed all day and Gold Rusher and the Buccaneer was sporadically open....the price of any of the concessions was OUTRAGEOUS, but the cost of general admission seemed good compared to Disney. Very few drinking fountains and they really push the refillable $20 dollar sodas...Kids all around were having a blast...I didn't see to many middle agers enjoying themselves...",squatpuke
50,Great Roller coaster park,"For adrenaline seekers, it's the best park you can imagine. Really amazing rides.

10,Save your $$,"First of all, it is not cheap. Second, there are only 6-7 rides with approx 90-120 mins queuing time. Third, three queues before getting into the park to queue for the rides: ticket queue, season pass queue, entrance queue. We spent three hours queuing just to get into the park, To make things worse, there is no real queue, just 1000 people swamp elbowing each other. Nightmare at the best, even theme parks in third world countries can do better. It might be good for teenagers but definitely not for adults or kids.",hcze
40,Just the best for the number of coasters. Loved it!,"Alot of people complain that the queues are long (well they will be in summer holidays) and that the staff are unhelpful (far from our experience) and that the water is expensive (try the free water fountains).We were visiting from the UK so we splashed out on the platinum flash pass which was expensive at $125 each plus the $49 5 day advance admission - which is alot! However , you had to pay an extra $15 for 'X2' - so we got in early and rode that with no queue. The pass gets you 90% of all queue times unlimited on all coasters accept X2 (as mentioned) and Full Throttle, Twisted Colossus, Superman which is limited to 1 go with 90% off queue. All other unlimited and you can stay on twice!I don't think the cheaper passes are worth it as they don't include the big rides. If you are visiting in the Summner Holidays get one if you can to avoid the queues... or go off season.Twisted Colossus was like no other coaster I have been on. Will not forget our last ride which was in the dark aligned perfectly racing the other coaster. If you are visiting from UK, this is three times the rides than Alton Towers. You need a pass just to get round in a day.Our top tips would be:1. If visiting in peak season you will need a platinum flash pass.2. Take an empty bottle in to fill up on the water fountains3. It was really hot. Luckily we were close, so we took the afternoon out between 2 - 4:30. As the park was open from 10:30 to 9pm we got everything in.4. Use the single rider queues on Twisted Colossus and a few other rides - so much quicker than main queuesPretty much a big thumbs up!",ianthompson87
50,Thrillride heaven in Southern California!,"Like every other amusement park or theme park in California, you definitely have to expect to spend some money here: parking, entrance, food, etc. will all add up quickly. Local residents might get discounted deals with season passes or special promotions that are scheduled for specific dates, but the expenses might still be hard to swallow. However, the value of what you pay for, can't be beat, especially if you are taller than 54 inches and want some adrenaline rushes! This park is rollercoaster-fan heaven: lots of options: wooden, steel, drops, inversions, loops, seated, standing, hanging, flying, etc. If great rides are what you want, you came to the right place (and you will be getting what you pay for)!",Ray Q
40,"Aww, super mans closed? Dang it!","This is the most amazing theme park I have been to. The rides were awesome although not all of them. The rides I wasn't so keen on were ""the green lantern"" ""viper"" and ""apocalypse"". Each one has its own reason. The green lantern first off was absolutely gut renching. I felt like I was going to pass out several times, about 3, when we were dropping and spinning at the same time. Luckily though I didn't. Next, viper. This rollercoaster gave me a headache as we were going around the bank turns and over the loops. And apocalypse was the most discomforting ride I have ever been on. Granted, it's theme is really cool as you go in but when you ride you are constantly rattled about and banged against the headrest. On a much happier note I loved this theme and going on most of the big rides there. It was the most fun I have ever had in my life. Apart from jumping from the stratosphere in Las Vegas! I say most rides though because I was disappointed to see that I didn't get to superman in time as the closed it due to a problem with it or something. Goliath was closed, x2 was closed and scrambler was closed.but despite that I loved it there and there were plenty of other rides there to entertain myself with. If you do decide to go there my recommendations for the rollercoasters are tatsu, riddles revenge and twisted colossus. Awesome rides. Plus try out Lex Luthor's drop of doom. That was the first drop tower I had ever been on... And it certainly won't be my last!!!!",Keiran H
10,Stay Away,"What a joke if a place dirty smelly and although it seemed like the car park was half empty the wait time where crazy, no real shelter from the sun and $4.50 for water, we did two rides and left, I can tell you it is not a great place to bring kids of any age a very rough crowd swearing fighting and just ruining what was already a pretty disappointing experience.20 min wait in 100+ degree heat with no shade to get in and the same on the way out, smoking everywhere and gangs of kids being chased by very stressed security guards.Forget lines waiting to be served, just push as hard as you can and scream at the server it's the only way oh yes and be as arrogant as you can be.Stay away",reddymurt
50,BEST big coasters,"Six Flags is home of the BIG coasters. I am never disappointed with the thrills I get there. I try to get back home at least once a year to visit family and all the amusement parks I grew up in, and Six Flags is a must!",UtahMike2014
10,My last visit,"Last year we went to Knotts for my daughter's Birthday theme park visit. This year she chose Magic Mountain. In short, I concur with many other reviewers who noted that the park is dirty, run down, with indifferent staff and terrible, overpriced food. The Flash Pass system is complex and overpriced, and then poorly signed and run by the indifferent staff at most of the rides. The day we went in early June was 94 degrees, making it unpleasant even to relax when not queuing or riding. Although I think a couple of their rides at the best of the best (X2 and Tatsu, for example), it's no longer worth enduring the degraded overall experience to ride these. I'll likely be going back to Knotts or even California Adventure simply for the quality of the atmosphere, staff, and less overall feeling of being ""processed.""",LexVentura
20,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!,"Just got back from a visit to Six Flags Magic Mountain and feel really let down. Firstly, it is not cheap in any way shape or form. For 2 people it was $120 including parking. If we had got a fast pass it would have been more than double that cost.Secondly, the queues were ridiculously long and this led to the major rides being shut down...so we couldn't get on 2 of the biggest rides. If you from the UK, save your money for Thorpe Park because the rides are as good and you can get in for a lot less. Six Flags are a con...",jinx2010
50,Great Roller Coaster park,Coming from South Africa this was the best Roller Coaster park i have ever been.... Had a blast. It was there last day of season so from the stands were close and allot of school groups... but even though it was excellent ... will def. want to go back.,jpkobus
30,All for Teens,"Long lines, Not enough facilities to accommodate guests, Waiting in line for a half hour for the bathroom, Teen hangout, They did have a good variety show that my husband and I went to. Drop your kids off and let them go to town. They do have some amazing rides if you like the extreme.",Heather H
40,Long lines but some good roller coasters,"We only had about six hours here before we had to fly out of LA. We managed to go on about 5 roller coasters including Scream, Batman and Riddlers Revenge, X2. X2 not for fairhearted. I like the Scream the best. Look out for the single rider lanes, much quicker to get on rather than the 1-2 hour waits..",Travpe
40,Its a must do attraction in LA if you like roller coasters.,"Forget Disneyland and Notts Berry Farm, those places are for kids. This place although still a kids theme park is for people who love rollercoasters and this was my 5th visit. Its an absolute blast and a must for rollercoaster fans from overseas. The Flash Pass is worth the price, but try go mid week if you can.",Bjorn B
30,LONG Lines,The rides were amazing only if you want to wait sometimes over an hour for a 3 min ride. My phone flew out my pocket during the ride. Their lost and found has a pretty good system.,Shelli K
40,Good for the thrill seeker,"I think some of the attractions need to be re categorized, I am not a thrill seeker by any stretch but managed to go on the scream roller coaster unscathed. Also maybe a leaflet or a board saying what coasters are closed so you don't walk around to discover its closed would be a good idea.",Teagzy91
50,Amazing!!!,"This is so much fun for the whole family, especially if you are into rollercoasters like my kids!! The place can get busy however, this was our second time and in spring there were a lot less people than during summer. It is a massive park so if you only can I recommend visiting during low season as it's packed with such cool rides",MargeryRob
50,The City of Roller Coasters!!!!!!,"This place was packed when we went but ( waiting in some lines for popular coasters was 2 hours - all day non stop) BUTTT - this truely a roller coaster connoisseurs Venue. IT does not dissapoint at all, only that everyone was there and wanted to experience it at the same time we did. Its a big park with alot to offer. --- I'll be back in an off season time though!!",Aaron N
20,Very Disappointed ...,"It has been several years since I've visited Six Flags Magic Mountain here in California, unfortunately I was very disappointed with this last visit, the place is filthy dirty.There was trash all over the place around the rides and specially around the food courts which made it very unpleasant to eat. And if that was not enough the attitude of the guest attendants left a lot to desire.Not only were they not courteous they actually were rude, clearly it seemed like they did not want to work there, and thinking about it, I do not blame them... Who would want to work in a place that has been left without maintenance and clearly lack of great management.We can clearly understand the long waits before going on rides, but we also ended up having to wait long just to get food, and it was not because of too many people in line, it was just too little personal with lack of interest in all of us the guests in the park.Like if that wasn't enough at the end of our day it was very frustrating to be at the gift shop at the exit trying to buy souvenirs and other stuff and having to wait long periods of time just to be able to pay, again this was not because there were too many people, it was because they have very few attendents at cash registers.Overall the most disappointing experience that we took from today, was the lack of maintenance this park has (it was just dirty), hopefully the owners and management take this review to heart and change whatever has gone wrong.By disregarding this review, they are not only hurting themselves, but also chasing away good families that enjoy visiting a clean Park vs. a ""ghetto park"" as my kids stated.",Tomas Garcia
40,Great rides but be prepared for long queues,"We did have wonderful time, the rides are amazing, but you can't fit them all in one visit, the queues were very long and the fast track was just a little too expensive. It did take an incredibly long time to get into the park itself - we were there early with tickets bought in advance but just to get through into the park took over 40 minutes, maybe they need a few more gates at the entrance. The Adrenalin rides are particularly good here.",LibWalesUK
50,Still a Great Place to Make Family Memories,"My dad started taking me to Magic Mountain when I was about 8 years old and 24 years later I still love it! My husband and I just purchased the monthly combo season pass membership. For $55/mo for five people it allows access to both Magic Mountain and Hurricane Harbor for one year. The inital payment was $63 and last weekend we made up for half of the yearly cost by attending Magic Mountain one day and Hurricane Harbor the next which would usually cost about $300 at the discounted rate I receive through my credit union, or a cost of $525 with no discounts on tickets.My two boys, both age 8, had a blast. It was hot when we went so we started with the water ride Jet Stream which we waited about 30 minutes to board, walked down to Gold Rush and got right on, then went on to Tidal wave which took about 15 minutes to get on. After that we went to Bugs Bunny World, which is the kids world that features four kiddie-coasters and somewhere around 10 other kid-sized rides. My daughter, who is 12, wasn't too keen on those smaller rides but since she has been many times for her birthday already she obliged her little brothers and didn't complain once. After the boys had their fun in Bugs' land we made a b-line to Roaring Rapids, by now it was starting to cool down and get dark and once we got to the ride there was only about a 10 minute wait. After we all rode together once my husband and daughter went to ride Tatsu (that ride scares the you-know-what out of me so I don't ride it anymore), and I stayed with the boys and we rode Roaring Rapids five more times within the 30 minutes my husband and daughter waited and rode Tatsu. This was one of the shorter trips we've made to the park and me, my daughter and husband only rode four rides, the boys rode a ton and had a blast.The ride operators were courteous of the children and seemed friendly even though it was nearly 100 degrees outside that day.We opted to buy the souvenir cups at 3 for $32 (plus tax came out to almost $40), but you can get free refills all day of the day of purchase and anytime after the date of purchase during the season for $1 per cup, or pay $6 for unlimited refills all day after the date of purchase.I would definitely recommend going on a weekday as Saturdays and Sundays tend to get extremely busy and can result in very long wait-times for rides.Also make sure to check the weather before attending and bring sunscreen.Check the event calendar on SixFlags.com to make sure the date you plan on visiting doesnt have a special event because that also results in very long wait-times and a very crowded, often frustrating park.Most of all, enjoy! There are many memories to be made here, many fun and extreme rides.Goliath, Scream, Revolution, and Riddler's Revenge are my favorite rides, but everyone's opinion on what an extreme, adrenaline-filled ride differs.If you are scared of coasters I do not recommend wasting your money coming here.",packyourheart
20,TATSU MANAGER BRAD WITH THE BLACK RIMMED GLASSES,"this place has been my favorite amusement park since i was a child! who cares about long waits when when the rides are so worth it!However, Monday June 8th, BRAD, TATSU MANAGER WITH THE BIG BLACK RIMMED GLASSES AND PURPLE SHIRT, granted us THE WORST EXPERIENCE EVER we got in line and expected a 90 minute wait time as posted, cool no worries. we moved about 2 rows over in line when they announced ""we are running only one car right now, we appreciate your patience"" , alright no big deal happens a lot.2 hours and 30 minutes later, as many of us are waiting in the front, we notice the fast pass people coming through the gate at an alarming rate with groups ranging from 5 people to 15 people. here's the problem.I asked the young lady handling the downstairs line what their limit is on how many fast pass groups get to go in, she gave me a certain number. cool! so i asked well when do we, who've been waiting for 2 hours get to go in? she offered to call the manager upstairs BUT HER MANAGER BRAD DIDN'T PICK UP THE THREE TIMES SHE CALLED. so i told her thank you, don't worry about it i will speak to him when i get up there and she let a large amount of us all in immediately once she saw how close we were waiting.once I was upstairs, BRAD stuttered that he was unable to come speak to us in line because in his words, ""THIS IS MY POSITION IS RIGHT HERE."" ok brad! I'll speak to you when I get off the ride. I explained to BRAD THAT AS A MANAGER he should communicate with not only the patrons but with his fellow teammates.HIS ATTITUDE TOWARDS PAYING CUSTOMERS IS ENTIRELY MELANCHOLIC, HE NEVER APOLOGIZED ABOUT THE INCONVENIENCE AND LACK OF COMMUNICATION TO ANY PATRONS, HE COULDN'T GIVE DIRECT EYE CONTACT WHILE SPEAKING, HIS TEAM MEMBERS SEEMED VERY DISSATISFIED WITH WORKING WITH HIM, A FEW OF HIS TEAM LOOKED CONFUSED AS TO THEIR JOBS WHICH DIDN'T MAKE US FEEL VERY SECURE AS RIDERS.BRAD also tried to put blame on the young lady below stating ""OKAY I WILL SPEAK WITH HER."" I was so appalled by his comments I let him know SHE WAS NOT MY ISSUE BUT THAT HE WAS and he literally said nothing but ""Okay, Thank You.""six flags, i would seriously reconsider brad's placement as a manager as the most important role in his position is customer service and happiness and he obviously doesn't consider that a priority.",Kristina A
40,"Amazing rides, long queues","Very big park. You could not ride everything in a day, especially with the lines!Was pretty happy with most of the rides we went on, although it was a bad decision to go on the rapids early in the day - we were saturated!

30,Amazing Rides Highlight this Amusement Park,"We spent a Monday at the park, and we really enjoyed most aspects of the park. Like most amusement parks in the summer, it was pretty packed and the lines were long, but a bit longer for a weekday than we would have expected.Upon arrival, we got a season pass because it was cheaper for a season pass and to ""bring a friend"" free for the day than it would have been to buy individual day passes. This bring a friend free doesn't apply to every day, so it might not work for everyone. Since we don't live near a Six Flags park, we chose to do and saved a lot of money. (Instead of $72 a person, we paid $85 for the pass and got both of us in.)The lines, like I mentioned, were long, but that's normal theme park protocol. The temperature was 104*, so the water ride lines were even longer.If you are a thrill seeker, there are many rides for you. The Batman is my all-time favorite, but apparently not everyone feels the same way, as we were able to ride it a few times without waiting in any lines!The park is huge and we didn't even get to see many parts of it.One big thing they need to figure out is how they can feed the people that are visiting the park. The longest line we waited in was at the food place to get some hamburgers.The 'main' gift shop was also an area of need. There was ONE cashier and at least 15 people in line. When you end up paying $10 for a container of sunscreen, they should be able to afford to make sure their registers are staffed adequately.",Patty L
50,WOW,We were visiting the Disneyland area and the family saw the park from the freeway as we were coming into L.A. On our way back home we had decided to spend a day there. We are season pass holders for the Six Flags in Vallejo near our home so there was no cost to go into this park. We had never been here before and WOW is the park great. There are rides and attractions and things to do for every age group. The entire family had a great time there. It may not be Disneyland but it sure comes close. It is easy to get to right off highway 5. It was crowded but that is to be expected. The only thing I would recommend is that if you are going plan for two days as the park is big and we found that we could not do everything we wanted in just one day. We will be planning a trip back and we all look forward to it.,RichK_1
40,Very Long queues when children are on holiday,"This very large amusement park has some fantastic rides, but the queues for the most popular rides can be up to FOUR hours long!They sell a fast track ticket but it can only be used on the lesser rides, not the most popular ones.A few years back I went in July and I found the heat a bit too much, it was in the 90's.Food in the park is a little expensive, but the portions are large.",Davejc67

10,SEVEN hours and only three rides..... JUST!!!!,"After a lot of raving reviews myself and my party paid a charter to take us to the ""six flags"" which was explained as ""Better than any other amusement parks"", ""next to no lines"". What a horrific realisation awaited us. No lines were under and hour and a half, the staff did not fill the rides, which made the wait time longer, half the rides were closed at one stage or another throughout the day, signs for times waiting weren't changed and then when they were staffed laugh with a comment of "" woop should have changed that a while ago"". We stuck it out for three hours and only JUST got on three rides before leaving.Considering we had attended much busier Disneyland,Disney world, universal studios LA and Florida, and they are what you should expect. Rides actually filled, good staff and correct wait times.",Amelia M
50,Awesome Park!,"Everything is just great. The park has some of the best Rollercoasters in the world. Admission fee is ok to some of the other parks. While visiting the Los Angeles region, make sure to visit this park in Valencia. Can't wait to go back some day.",EK-TRAVEL77
20,Poor staff and lack of information via websitr,Went to six flags magic mountain LA with family. Booked six tickets three days in advance to attend at the park on Friday 29/05/2016. Arrived at park and were dismayed to find dozens of school parties ñ it was apparently graduation night which as an international traveller we weren't aware of but no mention of it on web site when we booked. The main issue other than the lack of information was the shortage of staff and the poor quality of staff in the food outlets. The whole day turned into a waste of time as we were unable to do what we wanted to do. We were told by a member of staff on the day that the park was expecting big numbers but were short on staff. Expected a great day out,Palave
10,Please don't waste money here,"This place is so corporate in the way they do business all over the park.The full throttle bar has a nice atmosphere, but is so slow for service. The ride attendance are very slow and can only do things they are told to. So if you are a mindless robot and love the way the corporate environment has made kids now days to act, by all means visit the park and hopefully you will have a good time. So far it has been a 33% for me.",Swavepro
40,Insane rides!,"Having only been to Alton Towers I wasn't sure what to expect but i was certainly impressed. The queues to the bigger rides were at least an hour long but you can purchase queue skip for approximately $70 where you book a time to ride. The x2 was the scariest ride for sure, closely followed by the superman.",Abi I
50,Best amusement park for thrill seekers in the world.,"Summary: best amusement park in the world. This park features a unique set of killer roller coasters for the thrill seekers. Not for children, the elderly, or people expecting. They have a little bit of everything. From the Superman ride the catapults you from 0 to 100 miles an hour in just a few seconds and then goes vertical. Or the drop zone on the Superman which takes you way up to the top and drop you straight down. My favorite is the Viper with the worlds tallest loop on the roller coaster. X2 is pretty cool now that it finally works. You sit in your cart and it twists and turns you as you're on the roller coaster to maximize your experience. They have knocked down there to legendary wooden roller coasters and have replace just one of them. The new one is okay but I miss the old one. My back doesn't miss it but I do. They also have Goliath one of the tallest roller coasters in the world. It hit speeds of almost 90 miles an hour as it plunges you straight down to what appears to be your terrifying death. Just awesome. They've slowed it down from when it was first installed so you don't get that white out feeling anymore, sigh. They have the joker which is a standup roller coaster they have scream which is okay and it hits speeds in the mid 60s or low 70s, I can't remember. And I think that's about all the customers worth mentioning. Tatsu is also good. Try to visit in the off-season as you can get more rides in. And make sure you stay late since you'll get even more rides in. Sometimes if you're lucky they let you sit on the roller coaster if there's no line. I once rode the viper for 15 times in an hour and finally got motion sickness at that point",jason r

The roller coasters grow more impressive each year and even the old ones can hang!The roller coaster architecture is magnificent. From the worlds tallest loop to the worlds first 100mph roller coaster, everything here is record breaking. The most exciting thing is that there's nothing for miles and you can see they're breaking ground for future roller coasters to be built!My husband and I bought season passes for our wedding gifts. We've been twice and still haven't reached all the great coasters. We went on Memorial Day which was packed, but the lines moved quick and we even got to see a show!The high energy show was held in the screampunk area. It exceeded our expectations. The dancing was awesome and the trampoline boys were the best! Go to six flags, it will enhance the quality of your life.",Cyril P
40,A roller coaster Mecca!,"This park is clearly the West Coast center for roller coasters. With 15 coasters in operation this park has plenty to do and see. There are also some more tame kiddie rides, water rides and non-roller-coaster thrill rides. The park is quite large and is bascically a big loop. I would recommend picking a ride to start with and then continue around the loop hitting everything you want to ride. We started with X2 and then continued with Viper and Tatsu. We went on a Friday in May and it was one of the first warm days in a long time. Lots of school senior trip groups were there too and it was pretty crowded with wait times in the 45-60 minute range for the big rides. I would suggest riding Tatsu, Goliath, Full throttle, Scream and the newly hybridized Twisted Collosus. X2 is fun but can leave you a bit dis-oriented. There are much-improved food choices throughout the park, including vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free options. The refillable souvenier drinking bottle is a great value is you enjoy a fountain beverage. There is a Coca-Cola freestyle machine near Full Throttle at the park entrance offering over 100 different choices.",Jeremy044
40,Super day hungover,"Had a cracking day here hung over!The only problem was the Goliath was out of order all day and we were not informed before we entered...

50,"Learn how to fly! Roller coasters and rides, too much fun!","The most amazing Six Flags I have been to yet. I love the design and the layout of the park. Purchasing the fast pass is definitely worth it although quite expensive compared to other Six Flags Parks I have been to. We paid an additional $120.00 on top of the entrance fee to upgrade to Platinum Fast Pass, this did not include the X2 roller coaster as it was an additional $15 per ride to skip the line. Personally I think they should just include X2 in the price of the $120.00.With the platinum fast pass, you could only go on some rides once. Again I think paying that much more one should have unlimited access to all rides.Besides that the park is spectacular! The staff are extremely nice, the food selection is awesome, the rides are very well taken care of and there's plenty of shade in waiting areas, lines. Prices for food and beverage are pretty good considering it's a theme park.There are large shuttles that pick you up and drop you off at your parking spot if you don't want to walk which is a nice touch.I would definitely recommend Six Flags Magic Mountain to everyone and will be going back!",Greg M
50,Twisted collosus,"I can say I was one of the first riders and I lived it! If you ride the original, well the experience is not even close. The new ride is wood n steel, and the ride is smooth. It's colosus on steroids. The only downfall is the cats are not being released timely, so most don't experience that race feeling they advertise. Also, it's only one track now, if you've seen the commercials and you're trying to decide if you want to race the green or blue, you'll end up on both sides. One last thing, expect a long line. One time we went the wait time was three hours, the next day was five hours. It past holiday. Have fun!!!",HappyMomwith5
50,What a great day,"We went all out on this one, platinum passes x3 cost about £300 for all of us. But it was worth it, the rides were fab completely surpassing anything in the UK. We did not have to q for anything, it was all straight on, except twisted colossus. But that was an hours wait and it was well worth it, we ended up riding that whole park and it was awesome",tenk012345

The only things that I don't like about Six Flags is that the food prices are really expensive and the lines are sometimes really long. I think that they should add more cars.",Juan S
10,The Glory Days Are Surely Over!,"I must admit that I am a big kid at heart and the thrill of a good roller coaster or like attraction is always dope! I can't get enough. When I first relocated to LA from NYC over 10 years ago, I went to Magic Mountain and thought it was a great time. I went recently with my girlfriend and had a completely different experience. It was clear that this amusement park has seen better days and seems to be suffering financial hardships. Many of the buildings looked like they have been neglected for a prolonged duration of time and most of the water features were inoperative probably due to a need to cut operating costs. The morale of the on-site employees seemed very low as evidenced by poor service and a general lack of interest in customer satisfaction. We just felt turned off by being there so we left after an hour. I would probably choose to not go again unless there was a change in ownership and revitalization of the facilities.",Eric D
40,Great rollercoasters!!!,Came here for a day whilst visiting California and can only say that these are some of the best coasters ever!!Arrived on a bank holiday but the queues for most of the rides were pretty short.Goliath was great and the only gripe we had was the attendant on Riddlers Revenge was very unhelpful when we had a problem adjusting the seat before the ride began.All in all though a great day out and would recommend this park to all rollercoaster fans.,JOANNE_M186460
30,Needs improvement,"I went here for a bachlotte party in May. It was extremely hot and most of the rides didn't have fully covered waiting areas. A lot of the lemonade stands where shut down and most of the back of the park was outdated and run down. The Batman and Riddlers Revenge rides need some serious improvements. However, they did do some updates on some other rides like Scream and Superman. As expected the food and drink were outrageously expensive and you can expect to over heat if you don't want to pay $8 for a drink.",Janelle L
40,Go on a week day,"The Rollercoasters were great!! We were there on a Thursday when they opened and we're able to ride everything we wanted with hardly any wait times. The only thing that was disappointing, and why I didn't give 5 stars, was the fact that 2 of the coasters weren't running; Superman and Goliath. Was really looking forward to both of them. Other than that, it was TONS of fun!!",Kelti B
10,Disappointing in every aspect!,"Disappointing is the least I can say! We live in Orlando and my kids always dreamed about going to Six Flags for the thrill rides. When we got here today, three of the main rides were closed with no previous notice outside the park or on the website. With those rides closed all the other lines were packed. Lines were disorganized, security was poor/non-existing, nobody checked my 6 year old son's height. Restrooms were filthy. Food was ridiculously expensive ( and we are used to Disney prices!). Personnel very inattentive. When we went on the Green Lantern ride, a staff member tightened up my daughter's safety bar and she told him it was too tight. He said that there was nothing he could do about it and that it was supposed to be that tight. As a result she couldn't breathe for the entire ride and hurt her thighs. Now we know why Disney is so successful.",Campos2702

10,Six Flags Magic Mountain,"WORST amusement park we've ever been to. Still testing coasters after park opening - had to wait additional 15 minutes on first ride for testing to be done. SEVERAL coasters down and not running. Wait lines were terribly long (and we went on a Monday). It's very apparent that they do NOT have an adequate system for moving people through the lines. Park was downright ugly - very apparent that NO money was spent on landscaping . We traveled 3000 miles to come to this park, and such a disappointment. Will NEVER come back. Park is not even open a full 10 hours. Definitely did NOT get our money's worth. People, do your research, and pick a park with better reviews. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PARK!",jhayden5269
40,Exhilarating Experience!,"A brilliant rollercoaster park to visit, if you love thrill rides. There's something for people of all age groups.The park staff and rides are not as polished as the ones you'd find at Disney, but it's alright. The restrooms are also not up to the mark.They do not allow outside food& beverages and overcharge you for the same inside the park.Carry powdered electrolyte in the summers to keep yourself energized as it can get nasty during the day.We managed to sit on only 9 rollercoasters in about 8 hours due to the large crowds and waiting queues, but we were largely satisfied with the overall experience. A Flash Pass is recommended for those looking to cover more rides.Do try the X2, Viper, Tatsu and Full Throttle rollercoasters. They're awesome!",Rahul Ajmera
40,So Much To Do In So Little Time,This place holds the 3rd tallest roller coaster IN THE WORLD (Superman: Escape from Krypton)! The lines can be pretty long but nothing you wouldn't expect near a city like Los Angelos. It's better to plan ahead of time and save up to buy flash passes cause that will cut down your wait time and let you ride more of them! I first went in 2010 and again in 2012 and a third time in 2013 ( the date listed is not accurate) and the rides just keep getting better and better. Definitely a must go to place,Kylie H
50,SO MANY ROLLER COASTERS,"so much fun!! wow! this is the place to be! fun place. They also have water rides, I didn't know that. I love water rides. Those were fantastic. Also they have rides for little kids. Its a great place for the family. I went on the superman ride!!! scary, but loved it. I wish I could of done some shopping there. Next time.",TreRG
40,Fun place,We caught a train and 2 buses to get there but was worth it.If you like roller coasters you will love this place.Lines are long for popular rides so get there early and have a plan.We also saw a Rattle Snake out the front near the bus stop which was very cool!,G H
40,Great Entertainment !,Our first visit to Magic Mountain was in the very early 70's before children and living close by afforded us the opportunity to visit occasionally. Once our kids were of age they also experienced the thrill of Magic Mountain. At one point my wife and daughter were employed there too. We now have young grandson's of age so we took advantage of their season pass ticket promotion and went for the first time yesterday in many many years. The kids enjoyed the rides in the children's area and the bumper car ride. They are still to small for the bigger rides. My only observation that was disappointing was the amount of disrepair we observed all over the park. Things are looking run down and don't appear to being maintained. It won't stop us from future visits it was not what we had expected from such a highly visited park.,WMSCV
50,Amazing Day Out!,"If you love roller coasters, this is a must! We were there for a day arriving before they opened and there were quite a lot of people with the same idea. If you plan on riding on all 19 coasters, you're going to need that flash pass. We didn't know what it would be like and we went on May 18th. Thought it would be OK but we think there may have been a grad night/week. However, not many people can go on all rides as it does take your toll. A couple of rides like the Batman aren't as smooth and really throw you about so you end up getting a slight headache. Leave that one last so you can keep enjoying the day.We will definitely come back and go on the other rides. We managed around 11 rides, unfortunately Goliath closed. Apparently needs a new part and has been closed for over a month. Missed twisted colluses as it was opening the following Saturday but just watching it on the Internet, it looks excellent.We used Uber app to get here. Normally a taxi would cost approx $90 I think for one way? Using Uber cost about $30 one way which for us works out around £19. The sat nav to magic mountain is a bit weird. Takes you to a weird route so allow another 10 minutes as the driver follows this route and realises they need to cut across or turn back. Expect to wait to get picked up as you watch them go in the same weird direction. We left around 6pm as that was when the park was due to close. Some days open until 8pm so check their hours to make the most of your trip.",Meeshlee
50,If you want to ride .... Come here 🎪,Riding these roller coasters is amazing...There are different level of these coasters all are good in my viewsThe best ones are the max thriller ones ....Don't miss it if you are in CALI,Nyphoon966

50,Day of Awesome Fun!,"Six Flags Magic Mountains is an amazing fun theme park and I had the best roller coaster rides ever. If you plan it properly, you can cover majority of the rides. Some of my best rides were - Tatsu, X2, Riddler's Revenge, Full Throttle, and Superman. A day well spent.For some of the rides, we had to wait for 2 hours, and the ride lasted only for 1 or 2 minutes. So the only disadvantage would be the loooong queues - and it would be better to take a Flash Pass if you want to cover all of the rides in a single day. Or better - take a season pass, and cover rides leisurely on different days and keep revisiting them till you get bored or tired :) ...",coolme_kiran
50,Wild crazy rides for adrenalin junkies,"Six Flags is a great fun place to take any teenager, over the height of 54"" for the biggest thrill rides. For little kids there is no height restriction for those riding with an adult. This is a serious adrenalin rush place, and no Disneyland for sure. My favorite rides are the Riddler's Revenge, Viper and Scream. I always have to visit my Chiropractor after these rides, but they are so fun. If you can go mid-week and stay away from week-end crowds, or school breaks, that's the best time to go. Also, go as early in the morning, when it first opens, and stay late in order to get your money's worth. We have gone at least 10 times with different teens and have found that it's a lot less expensive if you bring a cooler with your lunch, and go out of the park and then back in after. The lunch lines can get crazy so that is also a good time to get to all of your rides on your ride list because the lines will be shorter then, and eat later in the afternoon. We always go out to dinner after we leave the park, as in late.",NickiG555
30,Dingy in comparison to Disneyland for sure.,"The big rides made me feel like I was in a car accident, and my teenage son felt the same way. Dingy place compared to a spiffy Disneyland, but doesn't have the same crowds. Average theme park fun, but it would be nice if they would clean the place up.",urbancaroline

40,Great Thrill Rides...,...But it' definitely not Disneyland where everything is spotless. Employees working here are typically very nice. Rides are a lot of fun. Parking is outrageously expensive as are most food and beverage options.,DFL1962
50,memorial day,Excellent experience on a holiday....six flags extended park operating hours to accommodate visitors,valejandro
40,Rides are great,"Get there early coz queues can be a hassle. Lots of rides especially for adults. It is a bit rough on the edges but you tend to forget that when you on the rides. Universal is amazing but this place has its own flavor that is wonderful to experience. Worth a trip and definitely full of fun and screams. One issue though, the green lantern ride is one to miss. It damn looked fun but when we finished with it, our bodies were broken. The swaying and sudden spinning had us trying to grapple for a comfy grip and our heads was just not stable enough to warrant a good review for it. So, I suggest you skip this one if you don't want to end up aching afterward. All in all...worth the trip to spend a day.",Zii
40,Mental rollercoasters,A one day trip up the highway landed you at Magic Mountain. A great feast of roller coasters and extreme rides. There was not much queuing during the day as it was a quiet time which meant more time for rides. The whole place feels a tad run down but nevertheless still worth visiting for the rides!,Steven X
50,Lots of Fun,Still one of my favorite escapes. Magic Mountain has it all but doesn't rest on its laurels. They are continually upgrading and making themselves better.,Cubs1982
40,Nice day trip,"I was actually on my way to Santa Monica when I saw Six Flags from the freeway and thought 'why not?!?' Totally worth it! I've been going here since I wS 10 and roller coasters never fail to lift my spirits!! I would recommend visiting the park on a weekday rather than a weekend. There's a fraction of the people there and you won't spend hours waiting in long lines. Be sure to carry a bag or backpack with you to keep the essentials on hand. (Water bottle, sunscreen, jacket, etc..) and cash! About half of the rides won't let you bring your bags on with you, but instead check them in lockers. They all cost $1 and it's just easier to keep cash on hand to keep the traffic in the lines flowing.",AbraCadaverz
50,just watching the rides is heart stopping!,"I truly could not believe the rides in this place. Fast, twisting, upside down, facing the ground from high up held in by only a bar. Scary just watching them. And then don't even start talking about the bungee rides. Absolutely no way. It's a different crowd than Disney, you are looking at thrill seekers here and the young adult crowd. We try to go early at opening for shorter lines. Very reasonably priced for season pass. Buy in December for the best buy.",7seekers
50,Great Fun,"What a great day out. It really puts those Disney parks to shame as far as the rides go. This place has something for all the family and it will make the big kid come out of any adult. Eating here is a bit pricey for a family of 4, but with these sort of places, you have to be prepared for that. I find it is value for money to enter the park, but the parking fee is a bit expensive like all theme parks in the states",pdsearle
50,Top Thrills,I have been going to Magic Mountain a lot lately and it never gets old. All of the employees are very friendly and always willing to help with any questions you have. There are so many rides that offer different unique experiences that you will never get tired of riding them. The newest ride twisted colossus is one everyone should ride it exceeded my expectations in every way.,carroll_david98
50,The place to go for visceral thrills!,"Granted, I haven't been here in 20+ years, and I imagine some of the old rides from my last trip here are no longer around, and new stuff has been added, but I can still say I remember the place with much fondness. I don't remember the exact saying, but it's something along the lines of ""You LOOK at Disneyland, you go to Magic Mountain for the rides!"" For hair-raising visceral thrills, this is THE amusement park to go to in SoCal. And if you're here during the summer months, the soaking from Splash Mountain really hits the spot at the end of a hot Santa Clarita day.",TrojanSkyCop1
50,A must for a thrill seeker!,"I visited midweek on a rainy day and didn't have to wait more than 10 minutes to get on a ride. We managed to get on all the rides that were open, even managed to go on some more than once which is unheard of! I was amazed at the quality of these rides, they are like nothing I have been on before (England theme parks do not compare at all!!). I would recommend to all thrill seekers, if you are 'on the fence' about theme park rides, then it might not be the best idea as they are extreme. The only thing I didn't like was that my head got a beating from all the twists and turns, perhaps some head padding would be a good idea, I left with a headache for sure! Perhaps not the best place for families with small children as there is more to do for those over the height restrictions. There are plenty of restaurants and ice-cream places too and some lockers are rent per hour, so maybe just take essentials with you instead of a bag. Also, the water park next door is decent too, on a sunny day at least!",Ellen030692
50,Great for thrill seekers,All rides are worth trying no matter how scary they get! avoid going on a very hot day. Walking in the sun and riding all these rides will get to you!,No0osho
40,Amazing Place!,"Have been dreaming of coming to this place since I was a teenager playing on RCT2, and this was one of the parks I always used.We came during the week, and found it to be dead, which meant hardly any queuing time! The only issue was a few rides were off because it was not on a weekend, and Goliath being one of them, which was such a bummer, as I really wanted to ride this, but I'd rather some rides closed, and no queue times.I would highly recommend X2 (this was one of the scariest rides I have ever been on, you do not know when the seats are going to move, and going up was nerve wracking, as a ride should be) the only thing that was cheeky is you have to pay for lockers at X2, it's only a $1 but still as if you have not paid enough with the park and parking fees etc. Full Throttle is a MUST! Amazing! Green Lantern, The Riddler, Viper, Batman are all musts too!All in all had a really good day!",Adam S
40,Every bit better than I expected with many extreme rides!,"Me and my wife frequent ourselves to theme parks in the UK and we are well aware of America's title of having the craziest and scariest rides. Six Flags Magic Mountain in Santa Clarita did not disappoint!To begin with, the journey was short (we stayed in a well known international express hotel brand in Van Nuys) and pleasant arriving at Magic Mountain parkway; the surroundings were nice and I felt the excitement building up as the huge roller coasters towered up menacingly in front of the motorway exit!Shame we had to pay $20 just to park and walk a bit to the main entrance. Its only £6 at Alton Towers, Staffs, UK.Security was good - before scanning our tickets every guest goes through a metal detector and has a full ""pat down"" if its required by any alarms.Quickly we got through the ticket gates, were able to easily find and pick up a map and began planning our assault on as many rides as we could squeeze in. We got there around 10:30 and queues were no more than 10 minutes I'd say.The sheer height of these horrific looking roller coasters just chilled me, not to mention the different colours they are all in symbolising the fact that they have so many ""extreme"" rides on offer in one place! This was an ""American-on-another-scale"" that was oozing from the park which made us think the UK is left so far behind. Take note: we love the choice of extreme roller coasters! Not just 1 or 2 in an entire theme park!...This was short-lived. Unfortunately, three of the main attractions which I really wanted to ride were unavailable. I appreciate that if one needs emergency maintenance I'd rather keep it safe and not run stupid risks however, one can't help feeling deflated about a major ride (it was ""Golliath"") being closed on the day you've travelled there. The other two were closed because one was brand new (due for opening in Spring 2015 but I thought late May counts as Spring/Summer so was it running late?!) and called ""Twisted Collossus"" and ""Screamer"" was too close to the building work for it to be open to the public. Gutted I missed on riding these three!Anyway, the stand-up one ""Riddler's Revenge"" was fantastic, as well as ""X2"" (just wow!) and ""Full Throttle"" were both incredible. The latter was mine and my wife's favourite of the whole park and I think one of the newer rides too..?The Green Lantern one was odd and very different from anything I've ridden before. There was one like Air but much longer and faster too.",Phil C

40,"Great rides, average experience","If you are just a tourist, take care never to visit the park during weekends. Me and my friends went at Saturday, the park was extremely crowd with very long queues. Moreover, many times while waiting for the rides, they temporary stop for maintenance which make the wait time huge. Many rides were closed all the day for maintenance. It could be a better experience if more rides were running and within normal weekdays.",I_Ragab

(Nights are only a bit better) Want a pop to cool off? Sure, ""that'll be $12."" Seriously! The prices are obscene. The lines to the rides are to be expected, but the actual rides make the wait a waste. They're no better than a school carnival. Water park. ..separate ticket. ..more money. Disneyland-awesome. Knotts- fun. Magic Mt- avoid. In summary...rip off!",Lisa B
50,Best roller coasters,We have Magic Mountain. Universal Studios. Knotts Berry Farm and Disneyland! All of the Parks are great but Magic Mountain is the Number one pick for me for roller coasters and adults. It's got rides for the kids too! 5 stars,Dan D
40,Some of the best coaster ever,"It is plain and simple if you are of fan of big rides then this is your place. Our kids were a bit nervous at first until they experienced a few of the big coasters and were hooked. It doesn't really matter which one you go on it starts with excitement, then your a bit nervous and the full of adrenaline. We were lucky the park was not packed so we did not have to wait real long for anything. The park seemed to be a little less crowded late afternoon but that could have been the day we were there.Too make your visit a little easier I recommend not bringing anything in the park other than your keys and some money. If your hungry or thirsty then stop for a break and keep going so you don't have anything too lose.",JDTravelhome
30,"AWESOME RIDES, wish the waits were shorter","The rides are good, but when I went I had to stand in line for over an hour for The Green Lantern only for it to shut down right before I was about to ride. The staff didn't offer us ANYTHING! That was VERY disappointing. I mean, they could have gotten us a no-wait voucher for it or another ride, but nothing. Even more, they didn't seem to even care. I love the rides, when they work, but the staff...yeah ok.",Lorren C
50,Excellent and Life time thrills,"We had been to the park several times by now. The rides are amazing and breathtaking. there are rides for everyone.

40,Something Fun for Everyone,I was surprised that it was cleaner than most theme parks and they had a good variety of rides. If you plan on getting a season pass just allow an additional 1-2 hours for processing. It's the most out-dated system and I can't figure out why they need it to take so long!,Emma G

There are many amazing rides which he came back from with a smile on his face.The queues were small therefore I didn't have long to wait for him.The kids area, themed for Looney Tunes was excellent and the DC Universe area.The highlight for me was the discovery of the bird of prey nest which was situated in a tree near the Green Lantern ride. It was incredible to see at least 2 chicks that close to the rides and visitors. Still yet to discover what species it was.",munchkin1150
50,Rollercoaster heaven!,"Highly recommend this park if you love roller coasters. That's all it is and they are all great. Used Starline tours, who picked us up from Chinese Theatre, took about an hour each way but plenty of time at the park. Using a tour was good value, better than driving and much cheaper than a taxi. Went in late April, perfect timing as wasnt busy and wasnt hot. Only had to queue for the newer ride, X2, but well worth the 45 minute wait. Would recommend this park over Universal and Disney for adults, and particularly if you really just want to go on great rides. You have time to do all of them (if no queues). Seemed to be mostly Americans rather than foreign tourists.",512sharon

50,Not a theme park,"By all means this park is one of the best parks I have been to. Goliath, superman, batman, tatsu and the riddlers revenge are the best rides -I think-. Avoid going on a raining day since some rides maybe closed, and if you are going to the park on a weekend or holidays period, you must get a flash pass, or else choose a different day. Do not go if you have a weak heart, it is not a theme park, it is a roller coaster park.",Ahmed J
50,best park ever,Rides are amazing. Went in May was empty no queues just walked straight onto the rides. Superman ride wasn't on which was our only disappointment of the day,kelsbels76
50,Hard cores only!,"Some of the most amazing rides I will ever go on, like we have in England, but bigger, faster and harder. Air at Alton towers, multiply by 10, you have tatsu! Superman escape from krypton was short but VERY sweet! Same as lex Luther drop of doom which is bolted to the side of it. I was also one of the last few to ride the original colossus- they shut it down shortly after my visit so they could crack on with the revamp for this season.The q-bot system was very handy, if you can move fast enough, you can time your reservations as you are approaching the ride. Only shame you can't reserve more than one ride at a time though, but lessons learnt, will be revisiting next year",Heather O

50,Such a Thrill!,"I had only been on one rollercoaster before this, and so was not too keen on going. However, this was one of the best days I have ever had! Went on pretty much every rollercoast there. We got the Flash Pass and it was well worth it, and can see it being valuable on a busy day with limited time.The only issues was that there was a number of times various rollercoasters closed for a period of time during the day, for what we presumed were due maintenance. However, we didn't let this get us down as there were many other rides to enjoy!Highly recommend Tatsu, Batman the ride, X2,the Riddlers Revenge, and Goliath.",Clint B
40,Great thrill rides. Typical Six Flags issues.,"Magic Mountain has a great selection of thrill rides. The park was clean and generally well maintained. Food was typical of most parks today with a few decent offerings but mostly park food at high park prices. We noticed several buildings in the park were in really bad condition and need to be repaired or removed. Lines were crazy long for no more people than were there the day we visited. The ride attendants seemed to be poorly trained and incredibly inefficient in getting the rides loaded and going. Too many closed/limited rides with Goliath down for a broken lift chain, only one side of Superman running, Scream in a closed park section, Colossus still in rehab, Sky Tower was closed, Ninja only running one train and X only running 2 trains. If you go to this park even on an uncrowded day you won't regret getting the platinum Flash Pass to breeze past most of the lines and right onto the rides. It's the only way you'll come close to doing everything in a day. If you have a Discover credit card there is a special gate you can use at park opening to get in ahead of the crowds. Also note you get a 5% rebate on all purchases you make in the park on your card. If you want the most and best thrill rides in the area then this is the park to visit. Come early and expect to stay the entire day.",coastermeister
50,Excellent rollarcoasters,"Recently went on a Saturday, was a lot less busy then I expected. Rode most of the rollarcoasters, some more than once, we were even able to stay on some and ride again due to not many people lining up. My favourite 2 rides would definitely be the full throttle and the Goliath. Unfortunately we got a storm and heavy rain just after 3pm, so we didn't go on any more rides after this. But even though its a big park and a fair bit of walking we were still able to get most of the rides in. They have free wifi and computers to use at the coffee shop. One of my highlights was the funnel cake with ice cream. I am a big eater and could not get through a whole one of these on my own, but highly recommend at the end of the day. Overall had a great day. The carpark is down the bottom of the hill, its not that far to walk but they have a free bus which takes people up the hill if you don't want to walk it. The lockers were a little expensive to hire but we used it a number of times during the day.",mattPortStephens

50,Can't go wrong,You just can't go wrong with roller coasters. It's a bit far from Los Angeles but the drive was worth it. I suggest you do the flash pass because you wont have to waste too much time but I would go even without the flash pass.,Stefania D
50,So good!,"This place was even better than I expected! Definitely get the flash pass, yes they are ridiculously expensive but we only had one day and wanted to do as many rides as possible. This meant only a 5 minute wait on most rides. If you want to ride X2 pay the extra fee, $15 after spending $110 for the flash pass is nothing when it means you lose 2 hours on one ride. Everyone enjoyed themselves and next time I would get a two day pass!",Kathryn J

50,Amazing Adventure,"It was my dream to go to this amusement park since I was 10, cause I had heard the most amazing roller coasters were located here and my experience totally covered my expectations. It is an amazing advanture for people who love any kind of roller coasters. We chose a weekday and there were hardly any lines. And try to choose an unwindy day if possible cause some of the rides get close when it is too windy (they said there are some flames at the end of some rides!). One little criticism for the food service: Some people may get nauseated (very normal after the 10th crazy ride) and there are many barbeque places, that reeks of a very strong smell that makes you feel even sicker. And in windy periods, it is impossible to get rid of this smell, it is everywhere! A little tip for the guests, buy your tickets online (you do not have to choose specific dates, there are options for tickets), it gets much cheaper.",iremse
50,Thrill seekers paradise,"We visited last October. Being low season, and a Friday, the park was nice and quiet and we hardly had to wait for any of the rides. We didn't buy an express pass, and it would have been a waste of money if we had, but on busy days it would be a good idea unless you like standing in a long queue!We loved the variety and number of roller coasters - Full Throttle and Batman were standouts, (but Green Lantern and X2 were pretty intense - too much for me!!!!) And unfortunately Apocalypse and Tatsu were closed on the day of our visit - but then thats a good reason to go back.The only negative I would say was the quality of the food, and the difficulty in finding a beer!!!This park does have some smaller rides suitable for children, but Disney it ain't, and there are some parts that look a little run down. But its all about the thrills here, and if you are an adrenaline junkie, Six Flags Magic Mountain will not disappoint.",SuperTim69
50,Amazing day,"This place is literally as its name. It's magical in every way possible. It's so crazy and awesome. You just feel alive riding these roller coasters. Drop of doom ?? More like hell yea, amiright :D. I totally highly recommend it to everyone to go. Single, married, old, young,...etc. it's just fun for the whole fam. And DO NOT LEAVE until you try the X2. Get X typed :) peace",810alia
40,Amazing Time As Usual But...,"There's no other park this thrilling in the world. Keep in mind, this park caters to and was designed for high thrill seekers. Every ride here is BIG, FAST, SCARY & EXHILARATING! Magic Mountain is always a great time. My only con are the employees. Literally NONE of them have a personality. Your job is to entertain people and make sure they have memories from the entire experience. Other than the entire park being employed with non-personable teenagers, I love it here!",Jared R. O
50,Rollercoaster life,A real nice amusement park with tons of Rollercoaster that will keep your adrenaline level high. Also gluten free stuff available in choosen places around the park - check out map for them. Enjoy Roaring Rapids rather at a lovely summer place cause you will get soaked.,Jason Robert
10,Family with preschoolers or below & primary level kids pls skip this,"We went to this park firstly because it comes free with the LA Go cart, and we are in LA for a couple of days, so we have time to spare.Definitely more geared for teens and above as we view the map. Although there are some rides for younger kids we took only about 7 rides in total while other rides are closed.The park is pretty much empty on a weekday, not because of your preconsception that it is a weekday and everyone is in school or working.The park and rides are in need of maintenance.We have our lunch at Panda Express. The combo meal of chow mien orange chicken and broccoli beef , as well as appetizer of Chicken egg Roll and veg spring rolls are poorly cook and taste lousy. Even the minute maid lemonade we have often drink taste different. The path to get here is up a steep slope, definitely not stroller friendly.Even taking the 'wheelchair friendly' (but we have strollers) to get down the park to get near the entrance is a tedious effort, cos we adults have to first push the strollers up a very steep slope.Family with young kids can skip this park and are better off spending their time at other well maintained theme parks with better rides and food. Similar rides at the kid's zone can be found elsewhere.",Tot2Travel
50,A BLAST!,Always have a big blast when we go to six flags! we leave thinking about when we can come back again!,jwarriorc
50,First time and I loved it.,Amazing I had so much fun & my first time there and I hope I get to visit another time. I want to try more food items as well as shopping at the stores. Everything was amazing there.,baileyarianna997
50,great park overall,This park is great if you like coasters.The lines can be long.it is usually crowded no matter how early you arrive.,wildroot80
40,Great for older children,We went when it was one of the schools annual end of term activity. big mistake! My son and daughter both had a ball despite the crowd. Would do it again maybe without all the school kids..lol,Donna M
40,Exciting and thrilling!!!,"This is a great theme park for older kids 48"" and above as the main attractions are roller coasters and thrill rides. They do have a zone for the smaller kids as well along with carnival games and more. They also have some awesome water rides which are great over the summer.Get a FLASH PASS to maximize the park, on weekends, the lines are around 2 hours for the good rides, so a lot of time (and energy) can be wasted just waiting in line. It's really worth the extra $110!!! With the pass, on a Saturday, you should be good ...The only negative about this park and why it didn't get the 5 stars, are the small restrooms, which were also quite old. The lines for the ladies room (especially the one closest to the entrance, near the Revolution ride) took about 15-20 minutes because they only had 4 cubicles! Ridiculous for a park this size. And the other restrooms all over the park also had long queues... and were quite old... time for a renovating the bathrooms, and please ADD NEW & LARGER restrooms please - with 16 stalls or more... lets give the customers a break from having to fall in line - haha!ENJOY the thrill!",Marissa G
40,Magical Indeed,Wow! The roller coasters at this park are absolutely amazing. Must be some of the best in the world. I love thrill rides and they gave me what I love here. Great time. Only downfall this park has is the employees on the rides. Somewhat rude and impatient. Doesn't look like they put too much effort in customer service. All in all it was a great time.,Melirvin123
50,Roller coaster Paradise,"If you are a thrill seeker you MUST visit this park!! Some unique and world class roller caster are placed here, such as X2, Tatsu, Full Throttle, Golliath, Apocalypse, scream and tons more.

THIS is the place for you to screammm your lungs out, feel that heart skip a beat and just feel that craaaazy adrenaline rushing through your veins! Not recommended for the faint hearts though.. And not a place for kids at all.. I would recommend teens with their friends and siblings to come here, but I wouldn't recommend parents to come along (unless they're total adrenaline junkies). Their turkey legs are so good to eat every time you feel like you're hungry! Just prepare more cash for water and foods. I didn't quite like the stands though..Overall, best place to have a total fun with family and friends!",srhwonder
50,FUN!,"My trip to Six Flags Magic Mt. was awesome. I went with a bunch of my friends and we all had a good time. For the few hours we were there, we were able to get onto a good amount of roller coasters which is always a good thing. Come to the Hills of Thrills!",C4_AT_UR_DOOR
50,An amazing place for the whole family to enjoy!,"Being a mommy of 3 kids 3yrs and under, I highly recommend Six Flags! There's something for everyone, the kiddie attractions are awesome, especially their kiddie coasters! Games galore! Nice walks thru beautiful tree lined hills, express transits to ride you to the top or bottom if walking around gets a bit tiring. You won't find better crazier coasters for adults in Southern Cali, that's a promise!! And so reasonably priced! They always offer great deals also, to top it off! Highly highly recommend you visit this beautiful very amusing amusement park!",shishab
50,Fun for the whole family,Very clean and family friendly park. Whole family various ages enjoyed the whole day. Very polite employees,Wendichavez
50,Extreme rides,The rides are super intense!! The X2 and Tatsu were INSANE!!!! Superman was my favorite. Would definitely recommend this park for my roller coaster lovers!!,Sd87
50,Would come back again!,I am not a thrill seeker but took a leap of guts to try this place.It's more for thrill seekers as its just thrill rides / roller coasters.Super duper awesome rides and i am glad i took almost all the rides that were open that day.It was not super crowded when i visited in July 2014 but the express pass sure was put into good use.The fun times i had there will always be in my memories!,mjl3w

50,Best Theme Park in California!,"Six Flags Magic Mountain is amazing. The rides are crazy and amazing. The park was quite busy when we went though so we did miss quite a few rides but we got to do the main rides we went for except for Goliath and Scream because they were closed. The best rides are X2, Full Throttle, Tatsu, Superman Escape from Krypton and Lex Luthor Drop of Doom. The worst ride was Green Lantern, it was fun but it was so painful, it whipped you around and after that ride I had marks on my shoulder. The staff weren't the most friendly and they did take quite a while to load the ride and stuff. If you want a theme park to get away from Disneyland with great rides then go to Magic Mountain, it's the best.",Rami A
30,Big Coller coaster Theme Park,"Family of 4 with two teens. Got a deal off website for 43$ a person. Rides are fun and thrilling , although it seems like lines were short but still quotes where high on wait time the lines did not move fast at all because the park takes their sweet time reloading and ride after ride it seems that they where only using one cart.... I remember it going much faster in the past in regrds to more carts...and I'm not sure the reasoning of this I hope it's only for safety and that it would go back to how it used to be soon, honestly we spend at least an hour per thrill ride you in line!!!÷You would think they would want to get you on& off rides quick, so your out there spending you money rather then just waiting in short lines? The nachos were good not stingy on the cheese and fresh and thin chips yum..., we bought a refillable drink cup for $10 bucks I think it was $15 normally but our tickets we printed out had some coupons on it we used, refills for the day you buy it was free. It was hot so we got a lot of refills and sometimes water too. To my understanding they are under new owners or something but they still lack on Park cleanliness.... they really need to have more employees picking up or be more productive and have trash cans around so it's not on the ground everywhere, gross! Unfortunately from the last time we came 3 years ago prices are higher to get in and not much has improved, it Def is a more teenager environment...duh but They didn't seems to have much more to do then rides kiddy one or otherwise, kimda boring.... if your not on a, ride.the batman show is no longer it would be nice to sit and do something else for a while.Park info, thrh dont open until 1030 and close at 9pm, I didn't feel like I got my $ out of it. We only got to go on 7 rides.Viper, batman, green lantern, wonder women, ninja, revolution a few times... and the newest ride full throttle looks crazy fun but the wait was like 2 hours,...just stupid lines size doesn't match wait time, they were taking a massive amount of time loading and unloading that one ride ... Once the ride stopped they were leaving people in the cart for like up to 5 min ......ridiculous!!! So we skipped it and went home at 8....We got a funnel cake loaded up , we ate the crazy out of that thing...delish! Coffee was just ok kinda watery. I found one dope store that carried some awesome surf shop clothes... cute stuff, sweet flip flops and at good prices.... Maybe we'll be back maybe. They have a bar i probably would have sat in if i thought of it sooner. I think it's a, sports pub. We ate dinner out side the park across street at Wendy's , they seems to be a little more expensive then the Wendy's in our home town but maybe like .50 to the dollar. They have a red lobster and a Marie calendars in the, area too. Have fun!",momgq
20,"Perfect for thrill seekers, not so much for families.","I grew up going to this park, it's always growing and adding new coasters. As for the rides, they are lots of fun and many different options to choose from. But the park itself has changed drastically from a family oriented environment to more of a teenage/gangbanger hangout. It has also become very overcrowded and poor management is to blame for the state of the park. Such a shame to see it turn this way, would not recommend to families or young children.",Summer W
50,Yearly Church Trip,"I have been to all the amusement parks in the Los Angeles County and vicinity and I choose Six Flags Magic Mountain 100% of the time. You can't beat the price per person and whenever we take our church young people, Magic Mountain always gets the deciding vote. It is by far the best bargain for the fun. The rides are exhilarating and there is something to do for all ages.",PastorVJ
30,Vastly disappointed with the way this park is operated,"We spent more time waiting in line than on the rides. The rides weren't run efficiently at all and the staff didn't care there were empty seats available. I understand you get the flash pass and pay for it, but they should make them at least enter the ride again instead of being able to stay on and ride again. The rides we were able to get on were fun and were thrilling and intense, but it took two hours to just get on Tatsu...",doc10261881
50,six flags,"great for family and friends, best to bring walking or running shoes, there are a few water rides so it'd be good to take a waterproof bag to place cellphones and wallets. employee's are very friendly and the rides are amazing.",jazminesilva70
50,The best place in California for an adrenaline rush!,"This is my favorite amusement park in California (besides Disneyland of course)! This park has the BEST coasters, and if you don't mind going during the winter months, there is usually NO waiting on ALL of the rides. I'm not even joking, I've been able to do all the bigger roller coasters in less than an hour, and that even includes Lex Luthor: Drop of Doom. The food in the park is a bit pricey, but I always recommend going outside of the park and grabbing lunch if you don't mind leaving and coming back. You can pay monthly for the season passes now, and you don't necessarily have the renew your pass every year. You can just continue paying the same rate you started paying in the first place. If you happen to go on a busy day (during summer months or if there are events at the park you didn't know about), get a flash pass. It will be your best decision, because it will be busy, and you will not want to stand in line for hours for a ride.",candicenicole4
40,"Rides are awesome, park management not so much","The rides are awesome! We came purely for this experience. We were disappointed Goliath and Scream weren't open, but we knew that prior to arriving.We purchased the Gold Flash Pass which was a must for us (coming from abroad and wanting to get on almost every ride). The only one we missed was X2 and Superman. We had to make a decision between X2 or Full Throttle, and decided on Full Throttle (which was definitely a favorite!). #1 on our 'Top' list was Tatsu though.The line management is atrocious. If they would place an attendant and sort the lines properly, there wouldn't be any issues with people wanting to be lined up with their friends, and Platinum Flash riders who mess up those orders. We saw lots of runs with less than 1/2 capacity onboard. The wait times could be so much shorter if they managed the lines properly and made sure every run was at full capacity.Drinks and food are extremely overpriced, even by amusement park standards. Cheap to get in to the park, but expensive to be inside!",Aya I
40,We had a blast,"Spent an entire day here. Prices for a season pass are almost the same as a day pass, so if you think you'll be returning, get the year pass.Kids were 6 and 9 and the 6 year old actually rose 2 of the bigger coasters, the Gold Rush and Ninja. The 9 year wanted to do them all, but we didn't get the Fast Pass so we couldn'y hit them all in 1 day.About 3 or 4 coasters were down, so 1 star off for that. Probably contributed to the 60 to 90 minute wait times at a couple of the other coasters (Full Throttle, Superman, Tatsu). Will come back in a couple years when the 6 year old is tall enough for all the rides. HIYA!",Brick_Tamblin
20,"A gastronomic desert, set among a maze of attractions","If you want burgers, chips, hot dogs without any taste, then this is the place for you. However, if you value your stomach, then don't eat here.The attractions are varied, with a large array of roller-coasters, but the main problem is that you waste so much time finding your way around. There are maps, sure, but you don't know where you are. A note saying ""You are here"" would help. The staff are not knowledgeable; only one person could direct us to a particular fast food outlet. Even the Exit signs are hard to find.Big complaint; we arrived at 9.30 a.m. for an advertised opening time of 10.30 but had to wait for 90 minutes to get in. The Flash passes are good for avoiding queues, but so overpriced. You only find out the final price at the end of the booking process.If you have money to burn, and a stomach which can stand everything nature can throw at it, then this is ideal, However, if you have an ounce of reason, then visit Rodeo Drive; there you know you're going to be ripped off!",Brian C
30,Good rides!,"The rides here are definitely the most intense overall in Southern California, however the park itself is rather unkept. At Disneyland you get a feeling your kids can leave your sight and they are in no immediate danger. Six flags however is not a place i would recommend letting children run around without your supervision.",peterholland18
50,Some of the best coasters ive been on,"I will start out by saying if its busy, you will not be able to ride all the good rollercoasters without a flash pass. Average wait times were at least an hour. In my opinion there were about 8 must ride coasters. Superman and Full throttle were awesome, as well as Tatsu, the Riddler and Goliath. We spent an extra 120 bucks to get the flash pass where you can use a little device that lets you reserve your time to ride one coaster at a time. It was by far the best investment because if you don't get it, you are not likely to be able to ride all the good ones in one day. Some of the thrill rides as they call them were really gut wrenching and very exhilarating. Seriously awesome rides. Will definitely be going back to try the newly opened Twisted Colossus. Half hour or so north of LA",MjLivingston
20,"Typical six flags. Slow lines, broken coasters, unfriendly staff","If you have been to other Six Flags, then just set your expectations accordingly. This park has lots of fun coasters, but Six Flags still sees the guest as an inconvenient necessity of doing business. Few employees are friendly, things look rather run down and weather-beaten, three major rides were shut down half the day for maintenance repairs, and three others were only running one train due to problems. This means two hour waits on a day when the parking lot was only half-full. This park could be world class if only a company other than Six Flags would operate it. IMHO, it's a shame to see it being run down so badly.",Mark B
50,AWESOME SIX FLAGS,Six Flags is very fun and amazing food rides and shows very worth going there if you want to have fun Highly recommend going there whether with friends or family it is fun fun fun,ogoscar1988
50,Awesomeness,"We arrived 30 minutes before the gates were due to open to see thousands of people lined up. At first we thought ""oh no"" but the line soon moved forward. This place is geared for heavy traffic so even when extremely crowded things move along. We opted for the fastest jump the queue option available. And at 100 bucks each just for that it is pricey. We are so glad we did that though as we had a great day without queueing much at all. Some of the rides were going to be 90 minutes or more and one was 120 minutes. So if like us this is a once in a lifetime gig then get the speedy option. Also not to be missed are the funnel cakes near the main gate, awesome.",AdamS1970
50,the most fun ever,This is the best place to have fun and hang out so check it out So it's just but north of LA not to bad drive friendly staff and people visiting were Nice too!,Giovanni G
30,Wish I could of found out about fast pass at entrance.,"I had only one day to experience six flags magic mountain and managed to only ride seven coasters, the lines were that long. I found out in the park that I could have purchased a fast pass for the day, I am disappointed that it wasn't offered to me when purchasing my tickets. I did not even see it displayed at the counter as an option? The rides we went on were great, but we would have loved to ride X2, the 2 hour wait was just too much.",barry s
40,So much fun! Be prepared for headaches.,"We went on Wednesday 15th April. Very quiet. Barely any queues for rides, at most the wait was 10 minutes. We did all the extreme ones that were open, several were closed unfortunately, before retiring at about 330pm. We had our caricatures done by an amazing artist while there, definitely recommend having that done. The food we bought for lunch was horrible. Most the food places sell fried chicken and burgers... Poor choice of low cal food.Cost for an overseas traveller:$20 to park car.$70each to enter themepark.Drinks >$4.50. Meals >$9.50 each.You can not take food or drink in to the park.Take a pack of babywipes and sunscreen.",annmareef
40,"very good park, excellent thrill rides","There are a lot of rollercoasters of different types and eras of the rollercoaster evolution, if you are thrill junkie you have to go, in the other hand I have to say the park was kind of dirty when I visited, it maybe because it was packed but there´s no excuse.",Javier F
50,So Fun,"Awesome roller coasters! Waited about 20-30 minutes for each ride. It was cold and rainy that day, so the rides were on and off but we just waited out the storm and still had a good time. Much better than the summer heat!",traveleyesok
50,You will have fun (and scream a lot),"This place is great, for someone from a country with no real theme parks or roller coasters, it's a whole heap of fun!We went on a Tuesday, early, and there were no lines for most rides (we jumped right on), except the newer superhero-themed ones (about 30min max) - however the best ones were Viper and Tatsu anyway!Bring your own food and water if you can because the choices don't amount to much beyond deep-fried and greasy. Also a bit hard to get there if you don't have a car - take the Antelope Valley line to Santa Clarita ($20 return from LA Union) and then a taxi ($16 each way) or there is a bus which runs intermittently to the park.",Dan L
50,"If you have a Discover Card, TAKE IT!","Awesome thrills offered at Six Flags! also take your Discover Card. you have early access to the park before it opens, only a few minutes before but it gives you enough time to run to your first ride before the lines go up to a hour wait.",Feliciano1721
10,5 stars or 1 star? You decide........,"If I was rating this in the basis of the rides - 5 stars BUT if you can't get on them because of the queues (or not working) then what is the point? So a terrible review. We did arrive early as it opened, got on three rides quickly, then Superman (1+ hour wait), and then it went pair-shaped. Queues on the average (ie older) rides of 90 minutes, 2 plus hours for the big rides.Twisted Collosus - not open (although advertised as open in Spring)Superman - one track closedRoaring Rapids - ClosedGoliath - ClosedRevolution - one car only hence the 90 plus minute wait for an OLD rideScream - ClosedSigns everywhere saying ""line jumpers will be ejected"" - which is right but they just needed to add ""unless you pay us $100 per person for fastpass"".And even then there were queues for this - that's therefore a total of over $600 for a family of four to get in and ride!We left at 12.30 and came back at 7.30pm - still 2+ hour queues for the big rides so we got on one ride (Riddlers Revenge - excellent ride) after an hour.So in total we did 5 rides. I suspect others who did not get in early (or fork out another $100 per person) would be doing 2-3 rides max. Lots of disgruntled people wondering about with comments on queues.It's also worth mentioning that we visited Six Flags many years ago and it was GREAT then. I don't know what's happened since. Getting rid of Collosuss is (IMHO) a BIG mistake - as the new Wooden Roller Coaster isn't a patch on the old one. I can't see us returning, but then what do the management care - they're making a fortune and I will not make any difference.Summary: Great rides - if you can get on them, dreadful management on a busy day (did they not know it was Spring Break?) and BIG feeling of Corporate USA at its very, dollar- gouging, worst.",simon50
50,Awesome in April,"Our whole family (11 - 43) had a great time. We went on a week day in April 2015, and while there were plenty of people, there weren't too many, and it wasn't too hot. A summer weekend would not be our thing.",Grant Z
50,Amazing selection of rollercoasters!,"We visited Six Flags as it's a thrill-seekers park. You won't get the fully immersive, themed rides that you get at Disney or Universal but if you want an adrenaline rush and ride some of the best coasters in the world you should go here!Accelerator was our favourite, the world's tallest loop, followed by Superman and Goliath.The park was fairly quiet when we went, a Saturday late February, and the longest queue was about 45 minutes and that's only because Superman was having some issues.It's a shame that Scream was closed and Twisted Colossus wasn't open but gives us a reason to go back!We ate at Panda Express which was fairly good value and good quality. We saved money by using the water fountains rather than buying water. We used Starline to take us there and back from Hollywood (about an hour's drive).",Ian S
50,Fabulous day out,I have dreamed of coming to this attraction for many years and to travel all the way from Australia did not disappoint. If I could provide one piece of advice it would be to buy the fast pass because the lines were extraordinary and we waited for over 1hour & 45 minutes to ride Goliath. The rides are simply awesome and I cannot wait to return for another 6 flags day!!,8Aussietravellers8
40,Make the best of your time and money,"Don't buy food at the park. Take an ice chest and go out to the car for lunch. It'll give you a 20 minute sit break as well as a ""wallet"" break. Also, if you have a season pass or go to the park frequently don't worry about The Flash pass. HOWEVER, if you're only going to go to Magic Mountain once every ten (plus) years. Get The Flash pass. It may seem like a great deal of money but it likely means getting on 12-15 rides vs 6 rides! Realize NOT all rides will be running; some are shut down for maintenance/repairs.",Missie G

10,Magic Mountain had so many rides that broke during the day or were closed for renovation that our day was a huge bust!,"Had purchased pre-paid tickets for this theme park more than a week in advance and visited the park on Thur 4/9/2015. However, 30%-40% of the rides were broken or under renovation, such that rides were not available and the few remaining open rides were crowded with 60-150 min wait times. During the day, we waited for the Superman ride twice for 30 mins each when it broke down, the Ninja ride once for 30 mins when it broke down, and the Tatsu ride once for 30 mins when it broke down. Combine with that the fact that Goliath, Scream and Colossal are closed. This is the 2nd time in two years we have gone to Magic Mountain and found that a significant number of the most popular rides are out of commission. I would encourage travelers to pay for an additional day at Disneyland, where management cares about your experience and they actually know how to keep rides working for more than an hour at a time. You're going to waste your money at Magic Mountain and not get to do many of the things you had hoped.",Alex P

30,"rides fun, but maintenance needed","Went to Magic Mountain yesterday. First stop of the day was the restroom, and when the gates are just opened up, you would expect to see sparkling clean toilets, sinks, and floors. Not here. I have to say that throughout the day, there seemed to be a general lack of cleanliness in the washrooms. Never saw a staff member go near any of them with a cleaning cart. As far as the park goes, there are some areas where general maintenance is needed. By maintenance I mean paint, cleaning, etc. There was garbage in water areas, and the garbage cans had were pretty beat up, and had food and drink on them still. The paint in lots of places was peeling and fading. Looks like some areas have been neglected. Most of the staff were pretty friendly, however there were some that certainly acted like they didn't really like their job, were just putting in time. The rides were awesome according to my family, and they had a great time on them. Lines weren't too long for most of them. Food was decently good. you can't take your own snacks or drinks into the park, they do check bags and make you remove your own stuff, however I did see several families who somehow managed to get away with it. They have a refillable souvenir cup that you can purchase for $15.99, then you get a band that you can use to refill all day for free. That's a pretty good deal worth doing. Overall, the park is fun. My suggestion is to do this park before Disney, as there really isn't any comparison that can be made between the two.",JacquiWDawsonCreek
50,Family Fun for all!,"We had a great visit at six flags in April 2015. The park was not too crowded, almost all the rides were open and working. I have a 15, 12 and 4 year old and there was something to do for all of them. It was one of the best family vacations we've had.",pattiejor

50,Really good,"Went on Tuesday 7th April 2015. Park was not too busy. Went on x2 to begin and as it is right near the entrance it was pretty busy. 45 minute wait. After that we spread across the park and there were no more waits quite so long. The rides are brilliant. A couple were not open, but there are plenty to do so it doesn't matter. Superman had a persistently long queue even at the end, so we went Lex Luther Drop of Doom 3 times in total with only a 5 minute queue towards the end. Brilliant ride. Seriously frightening and probably better than Superman. Riddler's Revenge also a favourite. A few bad kids pushing in, some white trash families pushing in. Not much can be done about it really, better policing would be appreciated, but what are you gonna do? Food and drinks at pretty obscene prices, but that is just standard at these sorts of places. It was an awesome and memorable day out. Staff were friendly and the vibe was good. Absolutely suitable for families with children.",godnoselondon
40,Fun Family trip for everyone,Six Flags is a great excitement filled park with lots to do for everyone and great food so no need to bring your own.,maxi8421b

50,Always fun,"probably the best park for roller coasters. So many to choose from and so little time. Definitely recommend the fast pass. Otherwise you'll only get 5-6 rides in a day. Quite a hike around the park, so wear good shoes.",joenalissa
50,Worth even a few hours,"I had an extreme schedule this day & as such could only squeeze in 4 hours at the park. Tooooootally worth it. Was quite quiet so didn't really have to queue much. longest was for suoperman - 45 mins. Lots of the other rides we were straight on. I cant believe how bad the cheeseburger was though, and that was one of the longest lines....TIP - Make sure you get a map! I didnt and was bumbling around like silly billy.",Akiff R
50,WOW!,Myself and my girlfriend fancying ourselves as occasional adrenaline junkies chose this over the alternatives (Universal Studios or Disneyland) due to the sheer choice of roller coasters on display at Six Flags. Upon arrival we were so glad that we had made the choice to do so!There's a huge variety of rides on show ranging from the super tame to those that suit even the most brazen of thrill seekers means that no one you go with will be disappointed. We bought a refillable drink between us at the start of the day which came in very handy - We worked out you only needed to use it 2-3 times to see a return on the investment and makes a great souvenir at the end of the day!We purchased the platinum Flash Pass which was probably unnecessary as we went on a Wednesday but not having to wait more than 6 mins for a single ride all day was certainly amazing! If you have the cash or are attending on a weekend/peak season I would advise that you shell out the extra cost to get one of these. Be aware that you can only queue up for one ride at a time so for me the Gold/Platinum options were the only ones that offered true value.,DavethSYD
50,Best Theme Park in USA,"Best theme park and we went to them all, dont even bother with Notts berry farm, this place is the best and well worth spending the money to get the quick pass as the lines are soooooooooo long",Monriqui
40,kids fun day,My two 18yr olds wanted a day of rides. We dropped them off and went hiking about 30 min away and then shoping at nearby mall area. Kids loved it and enjoyed bonding time.,Dawn C

50,Great Time,As a family we've been to a few amusement parks across the country. The roller coasters at this one would rival Cedar Point. One thing. It's Magic Mountain and is truly built on a mountain. Wear your walking shoes and be ready to use your gluteus maximus.,Tom F
50,MOST EXCITING theme park in the US! 14+ THRILL-seeker rides!,"Six Flags Magic Mountain by far has the MOST thrilling roller coaster rides in the US (I've been to almost all of them in the US) -- it's best amusement park I recommend to visting friends & tourists -- over 14 exciting rides that'll give you a heart attack of thrills like X2, Riddler, Goliath, Scream, Tatsu, etc&the BEST value for the money --MUCH BETTER, BIGGER & THRILLING thanDisneyland that's for kids or Knotts Berry Farm that's smallerGetting tickets online is cheapest at about $30, $49 at gate or get a year-long season pass for about $74 good at ALL Six Flags theme parks nationwide or get the combo season pass for about $120 that also adds the Water Slide park next-door & includes free parking.Lines are SHORT IF you go on a WEEKDAY that's NOT a school holiday --avoid the long lines by NOT going on Saturday or school holiday --website called www.isitpacked.com & specifically www.isitpacked.com/live-crowd-trackers/six-flags-magic-mountain gives you live feed & estimates of wait times during the monthShortest times are on NON-holiday WEEKDAYs & Sunday where you wait only 5 to 30 minutes per ride --some have no wait times & you can go again & again!BUT if you go a Saturday or Holiday(such as Spring Break), lines can last over an hourOnly criticism is that food prices is about double the price of regular restaurants but that's true of every theme park",TravelFoodFitnessGuide Jason Delux Hun
20,Fast pass �� food��,Platinum fast pass is worth the not waiting in line. Got stuck on Goliath because the chain broke & had to be evacuated off the train. The ride is still broken. Stay away from the food at the sports bar if at all possible- really bad food & even poorer service.,Ann T
40,Awesome!,"This place is really awesome!! The rides are on point, the employees are super nice, and the atmosphere is completely family friendly. The lines are long but only for certain hours on the most extreme rides. Other than that, the place is awesome and totally worth a few visits!",nepsaa
20,Poor customer experience,"My family and I were disappointed before we even entered the park. After a great deal of anticipation, taking half an hour for the relatively short lineup to enter was hot, loud, annoying and completely avoidable with a bit of organization. We certainly never had this issue at any of the other parks.Waiting in line for Full Throttle was excruciating, I don't mind hearing/seeing some music but it didn't have to be deafening. After the lineup fiasco, we were pretty close to walking out right then and there. If not for the sunk expense I think we would have.Some of the rides weren't working, which I suppose is standard, but after waiting 90 minutes for X2 only to have it break down really ate a hole in our already shortened day.Food options were sparse and the lineups again ridiculously long and the food expensive for very so-so fare.Though some of the rides were killer -- Goliath and Full Throttle especially -- Knott's has SFMM beaten all to hell for my money.",Wayne A
30,"Great rides, place run a little inefficient during my visit","I was just passing through LA to catch up with a few friends, and thought I'd pop into Six Flags to see how real roller coasters are done. I used a shuttle service called Hostel Hopper, which offered a great price to get there and back.I arrived at around 11am and had to be back for the shuttle at 4:30pm (there was a later option of 8:30pm pick up but I had plans that evening).I pre-purchased the ticket online the day before, which helped with getting straight in at the entrance. I bought a sandwich to start the day, food prices were a little pricey, but that's to be expected.I ended up fitting in five rides, and nearly a sixth ride in my time there. Viper, Tatsu, Apocolypse, Superman and Batman. X2 and the Rapid rides were closed at the time. Viper and Batman took less than 30 minutes. Apocolypse and Superman under 50 minutes, and Tatsu (my favourite) was 83 minutes. There was a huge queue for Riddler's Revenge (but it did look pretty awesome). I was doing well for time lining up for Green Lantern, but a large influx of Fast Trackers extended the queue time past the estimated 30 minutes so I had to leave so I could catch my return ride back.The rides were great, but half the rides were operating on minimal cars, which extended queue time. The staff didn't manage single riders too well, this would have helped with queue time I'm sure. This is compared to say Disneyland or Universal Studios, where dedicated lanes for single riders exist, rather than the free-for-all style that I observed at Six Flags. Staff-wise, customer service was just adequate. Some were friendly, some weren't really enthused at all. I'm sure it's tough dealing with Tweens all day but you are representing Six Flags and need to make an effort.Overall, I'm glad I got to experience Six Flags but just the management style and staff friendliness sort of dampened the experience. The potential is there for a great day given a great atmosphere. I'll just let you know that I'm an engineer and am a fan of efficiency and excellent management and team culture, so my opinions may be a little picky. Here's hoping that it was just an off-day and that your experience is excellent :)",smason86
40,Great day out!,I have always wanted to visit six flags magic mountain and had the opportunity in March travelling from Australia. I had great day and purchased the flash pass which saved me a heap of time and we'll worth it. The rides were fantastic! My only negative and this is why I only gave 4 stars was the cleanliness of your toilets. They were filthy and need far more regular attention from cleaning staff! Other than that was a great day!,Stevengreg
40,Flash Pass Or Off Season,"We went to Six Flags during spring break (badly timed as we were holidaying from the UK) and we spent a hell of a lot of extra cash getting platinum flash passes which no doubt saved the entire day as we were able to get on all of the rides included with the pass within about 5 minutes. You get given a little device to effectively 'reserve' a spot on a ride before you get to it which is never a long wait and is often instantaneous anyway.I can recommend fast passes if you hate people and lines as much as I do - although you'll have to work some extra shifts to afford them as I did.You can ride consecutive times in many rides. Some of the major attractions you can only reserve once, the rest are unlimited and I believe X2 isn't currently included and they try to rip you off by offering it for another $15 on top of the really expensive fast pass you already bought. It's a sick world isn't it? X2 is the best ride, we lined up for almost 2 hours at the end for it.The park itself is nothing but good roller coasters for thrill seekers, nothing like Disney Land (which is a good thing trust me)It's a well laid out park and the food is a lot cheaper than some of the other parks around.If you can go off season and not during the holidays then I imagine you'll save and won't need the platinum fast passes. If not just do it or else your day will be wasted next to annoying kids.",TaylorMadeBombs
20,Welcome to the Queue Park,"I heard a lot about six flags. I knew I always want to visit at one of those parks.I've been to California and decided to check that out. Bought my ticket up ahead (great discount) and came in the middle of the week, thinking not a lot of people would be there.I came when they opened (10:30AM) and stayed until the end (6:00PM). I've been to 9 rides all of this time due to very very long queues (some where more than an hour, others where about 45 minutes each).The rides where OK, but it wasn't worth the long lines.",liran218
40,Fun for young. Kinda painful for older.,Is someone who is always love to go to amusement park I found this one to be very clean with a lot of rides to entertain however it is also very painful to go on some of these rides it's probably best for the younger generation,liketlab
50,A Park With A Heart,"Going to Six Flags makes you feel like it is your home, at least that is what it felt like to me. It is a place where friendships, relationships, families, couples anything can be brought together by a touch of happiness from the park. The rides can make you feel like you'll die either because of how fast or how big they are, but it makes you feel amazing afterwards. Soon after you realize why you're there and why you decided to get on it, you're living your life to the max at Magic Mountain. It is one of the best theme parks and it is a park with a heart.",joselynef2015
50,Six flags membership was a success!,We decided to get a monthly payment membership to gold pass and also opted into the dining pass as well this for us (being only an hour car ride away) was the best deal and best for us having a 5 star experience. Our meals and a snack was covered so that was really helpful in keeping cost down. The pizza place was extremely good. The primo slice comes with cheese bread and was some of the best pizza we've ever had. They even have a family deal for 4 where you get a pizza 4 sodas and cheese bread for everyone for $39.99. I'd recommend the red or green souvenir cup where you get free drinks for the day or for the year if you get green like we did. Tidal wave and her stream were open! (3/31/15) however roaring Rapids and scream wasn't. Lines were manageable and the park employees were all extremely nice! We were enjoyed the full throttle bar and our bartender was so sweet. We really look forward to our next visit.,HokulaniK

This park has so many amazing, fun rides and that's what we go for. :)",ABCDEmom

50,Family fun,"Was a first time visitor to this park but i fell in love with the rides right away. The lines are typical theme park lines (wait time 60 min or so) but thats to expect at a major theme park. The place was clean and the rides were great!

40,Not my thing but the kids had a great time,"We spent the day at Magic Mountain. It didn't seem crowded until we got into the 1 1/2 hour lines for the thrill rides. I can't imagine choosing to spend a day like this, but we did it for our tween/teen kids and they loved the rides. I wanted to be a fun mom so I went on the Top 3 roller coasters, all of which were super scary, and actually kind of miserable!

20,Don't go in spring break....,"Coming from nz to see my family I thought it would be nice to go to a theme park... Don't go on a weekend, don't go in spring break.... Long waits, lots of cues and even to refill your drink the park needs a bit of updating in the food cuing systems etc.... I got told 15min wait for a ride turned into a 2hour wait unacceptable and we went to ask for compensation they offered us a ride jump in the cue but then the ride broke in the end they gave us nothing for the wrong signage on rides... Universal was more pleasant.... My advice u want a thrill go skydiving its far better.....",James

40,"Good park, annoying ppl","This park has far and above the best rides in the land.

40,Not for oldies!,"Exciting yes, definitely not for oldies! The younger people will surely enjoy all the rides. A visit to California will not be complete without a visit to This theme park when there are young people in the group. Made for the 2 - 35 age group.",Homary
40,good fun,"Showed up early as we have been to six flags before. Went on weekday and waited 10 min for Tatsu which is a popular ride. After that it was an hour. Being out of towners decide to do gold flash pass for two of us four.It worked pretty good in saving time but so did going as a single. Feel the park out but even on a slow day lines are an hour as they run only half the cars.Some rides were closed for a good part of the day, but did open up later on. X2 was one of the best rides along with Goliath.Food at Johnny rockets was very disappointing... how can you make a burger and fries taste so crappy?",aveanddad
50,OMG what a great day!!,The only thing I didn't like about this place was that I didn't pay the extra to do front of the line. We got caught for 2 hrs waiting in line for one ride therefore making us not be able to make all the rides by the time our tour bus was picking us up. But the rides are fantastic ...... great day our,Nikki B
50,Awesome!,will always make this a priority stop when we are in town! Love the themes and crazy rides they come up with!,kyledk1313
50,Thrill Seeker,"It was last November 2013 when I got the chance to visit Six Flags. It was a dream come true, every since I went to all 4 Disney World Theme Parks last 2007, I've been craving for the thrill of riding the most epic roller coaster ride of all. Some of six flags rides have definitely made it to my list. When you stop by LA, make sure to go there on a weekday, there's less crowd and it would be a good day if you get to ride on at least 7 rides. I've listed down my favorite rides1. Tatsu2. Full Throttle3. Lex Luthor: Drop of Doom4. Viper5. x2",Bea Katrina M
50,The best,This is the best theme park Im gladly gonna go more times Since I have the season pass best place to go with groups of friends and just have fun and relax haha,nivek1021
40,Ehhh,"It used to be a lot of fun. Now it seems it is filled with young teens whose parents dropped them off for the day. The rides or the same, run of the mill coasters, and nothing else has really changed over the years other than the atmosphere. I would just stock up and hit Disneyland instead or even Knotts if you want the thrill factor for the rides.",Jon N
40,Still the most thrill packed rides of any park around!,"Made a trip to Magic Mountain this weekend. It has been at least 6 years since I have been to Magic, and it still provides a thrill packed day for people of all ages. The rides at this park are second to none. Got there right before opening time and were able to get on our first 5 rides with a 5 or 10 minute wait. After that the park started to fill up a bit and that was when it was time to find the sports bar and sit down, have some grub and watch the Kings game. The sports bar is a very nice addition to the park for us adults. Gives us a place to kick back where it is nice and cool and enjoy some suds. My group didn't get the fast pass as it was pretty pricey but I would guess if you were visiting from out of town and it was important to get on as many rides as possible this might be a good option for you. Make sure you try the newer rides like Lex Luther's drop ride, Tatsu, X2 etc. These ones will surely get your adrenaline flowing!!",Scotty S
50,Intense Coasters!,Worth the money for the attractions offered; but you will not have enough time in 1 day to make a dent in all of them. I only road 5 total attractions on a Saturday. 2-3 days required to enjoy the extreme coasters.,tibrock
50,I doubt there is any better theme park in the world,"I have always heard how good six flags is, however, no one prepared me for what was in store. This is like no other theme park I have experienced and highly advise you go here! Do it! Get off TripAdvisor and book! Now! Go!",shellkixass
50,Simply awesome!,"The most amazing park I have ever been. The roller costers are awesome and completely different from any other park. The only negative thing is the lines: the waiting time may be huge (more than 2 hours) deppending the day. If you want to save time, buy the Flash Pass. It is expensive, but completely worht. I went to 15 rides from 10h30 to 17h30 (05h30 PM) with it.",Alexandre Z
50,Flash Pass worked great for an intense day at Magic Mtn,"We had only one day available for the park as we drove from AZ to Northern California coast. We decided to invest in the Platinum Flash Pass so we could do the maximum coasters in the time we had. Great choice as we were able to do 11 coasters from 11 am to 4:30 pm. The 2 of us are 56 and 68 and LOVE coasters but hate lines and it worked out great.The Platinum Flash Pass is a palm sized electronic device that you can attach to a belt loop. It is not an intuitive device so make sure to get a ""how to"" guide when you pick it up. We purchased it online so got an express delivery line. When you decide on the ride, you scroll the display to the name of the ride you wish and push RESERVE on the device. Generally within 5 to 6 minutes we received the message that we were cleared to ride. We would then proceed to the ride, following the signs for the Flash Pass entrance (which can be tricky to find). We then bypassed those waiting in the hour to 90 minute waiting line to the head of the line at the boarding platform. In some cases the entry took you under the ride up and down stairways, etc. Your Flash Pass would be checked by a ride attendant and you'd be at the boarding area quickly.Once you were checked in at the ride your Flash Pass allows you to select and reserve your next ride. So you can generally walk from one ride to another minimizing your wait.Good news: you can maximize your coaster experience. The staff is helpful and knowledgeable about the attractions at the park. The park guests were generally well behaved, most in small groups. Far fewer young children than Disneyland, but there are some steep hills that make pushing strollers a challenge particularly on a hot day.Tips/cautions: Plan your ride sequence. Either download a park map or get one at the main entrance. The park is huge, so take the rides in a logical sequence or you will be walked to death. Take breaks! Going from one ride to another immediately may not give you enough time for you to recover your equilibrium after the previous one. And they can be intense. Take a small backpack in which you can stash caps, sunglasses, phones, etc. Some rides have lockers you can rent for the duration of the ride for about $1 (use credit cards for these). Others allow you to place your backpack where you will be exiting the ride without a locker. While these are not secured, it seemed to go smoothly. On some rides you WILL lose your cap or sunglasses, etc. or you will be so engrossed in trying to secure them you will not enjoy the ride as much. You can also rent a locker at the park entrance, but this is not convenient to use if you are taking rides at the other end of the park.Everybody has favorites: I enjoyed most rides, particularly Tatsu (seats rotate face downward so you feel like you are flying) and Superman (if you hear the sound like a jet engine now and then and see a ride going backwards up a tower then straight down to achieve 100mph, that's the one!). Least favorite: Green Lantern: felt trapped like a caged chicken in unexpected drops and twists. Lost my cap on the ride, but the staff was helpful in getting it back for me.Overall: A great experience and a great amount of fun. Buy your admission tickets online for a discount 3+ days out. If doing Flash Pass buy online as well as there is a faster line to pick it up. The park opened at 10:30 am the day we went, however, the parking areas open up much earlier. you will also have to buy tickets (if you haven't yet) and clear security checks before you line up at the park entry gates. However, it was managed well and the fellow guests were no problem.I guess we were fearless as far as older guys went - we had a couple of twenty-something's from San Diego than tagged along because they said we kept finding the ""gnarliest rides""... Ride on!",Jean B
10,No Customer Service,We mad a special trip and stayed in an RV park near Magic Mountain after Disneyland. We bought our tickets at the RV park and took a taxi to Magic Mountain. My wife wasn't feeling well so I went on a number of rides by myself. Then I went on the /Green Lantern ride. At no time did anyone tell me the degree to which the ride would try to dislodge my belongings. Near the end of the ride near the disembarking area my wallet fell out my pocket and landed on the platform just before the loading/disembarking area in plain view and within easy access. I asked if I could get it and the attendant/s said I would have to wait until the ride closed 17 hours later at 3AM. They told to go to the front customer service office about 1-2 miles from the ride. I'm 60 years old and I ran as fast as I could and talked to them and they were absolutely useless. I then ran back and told my wife I would wait until the park closes and she could go back to the RV. I then thought and told the attendants my medication was in my wallet and they had a service person there in less than 5 minutes and handed me my wallet. We left the park never to return. Also overpriced food and drinks and dirty bathrooms. Lots of security and apparent gang activity.,T556QC
40,"Exciting,Thrilling rides","VEry memorable and REally impressed by the many themes of rollercoster.However, during the peak period, the queue can be really stressful and long waiting line,.

10,FLASH PASS IS A JOKE! DO NOT BUY!,"I bought 2 Gold passes for $140. They weren't really clear on how the passes worked, just how to reserve times for the rides. The first thing we noticed was not all of the coasters are on the pass. If you want all of them, its an additional charge. As if $140 isnt enough! For every roller coaster, it would've been $220 and $250 for the back to back rides. Once we figured out which ones we could reserve times for, we showed up and still had to wait in line for another 35 minutes. I was under the assumption that a flash pass means you get head of the line privaleges. Not the case. They scanned our gadget and then we had to fight for a spot in line with the others who hadn't paid. Yes, i understand we didn't have to wait as long, but we should've had a lot more of a reward for paying that rediculous amount of money. Another issue we had, some of the rides didn't have a wait for flash pass. But because of our reservation time, we couldn't get in line yet. They told us to wait until our gadget vibrated, but if we hadn't been checked in by our reservation time, it would keep pushing our time back. We showed up at the park at 10 AM on the nose and by 130, we had only been on 2 roller coasters. We went home shortly after 3 because we realized we'd been ripped off and decided it wasn't  worth standing in line anymore.",Sarah H

40,Ghetto and fun. 8oD,"I had never seen so many ghetto looking kids, wanna be hoodlums, and trashy looking people in one place. Yet, all rides are still fun. Got to ride some of my favorites more than a couple times. As usual, be early, beat the heat and the crowds. Lots of people show up in the evenings, Those are the ones with season passes that just come to hang out for the evening. Bring your own water or water containers, avoid buying crappy overpriced food.",Joser F
40,Roller Coaster Heaven,"Let me start by saying, I have been to a lot of amusement parks. I have been on a lot of roller coasters. And...Magic Mountain offers some of the BEST rides I have ever been on. I recommend a visit here if you love coasters. I didn't get the Fast Pass though and the lines were LONG, so long even getting there at opening and leaving at closing, we couldn't ride 3 of the coasters. Since the ticket at the gate is half of a Disney ticket, it's worth it especially if you have teenagers. I do wish that there were more entertainment options. They could have really taken advantage of the Superhero angle.",ElizaRay
30,Fast rides and thugs,What can I say...the rides rock and the average patron is in a gang. God bless southern california. Bring shorts because it gets hot out in the desert.,Chad O
40,It's great if you like roller coasters,It's an awesome thrill ride park. I also love their Halloween event...even though this year wasn't as up to par as the previous year. The entertainment at the park leaves a lot to be desired except the Carolers this past holiday...they were great. I can't ride roller coasters so I get easily bored at this park. We have an annual pass that we use for holiday events and it was super cheap compared to our Disney pass.,Puppetgirldotnet
50,Wow you have to go there,We wanted adrenaline rides and this is what we got!! Buy the flash pass for a extra $100 as you get on the rides straight away- no waiting. We did 8 rides in 4 hours so well worth it if you want to get all the extreme rides done in one day,Rosalind D
40,Very nice - but still a six flags,"Liked - Short lines, Great Rides.Disliked - $3.25 drinks; single train rides.Listen, I get it, you have to do maintenance. BUT, there is nothing acceptable about being open two days a week and having multiple rides operating with a single train. Do a little management to plan and spread out the work instead of having some rides with 10 min lines and others with 2 hour lines... especially when the rides are only operating 2 days a week during off season!",Jody F
50,A roller coaster lover's version of heaven,"Loved this place and all of its rides! If you are a thrill seeker, love roller coasters and getting that butterfly feeling in your stomach, this is the place for you!ProsPretty much all of the extreme thrill rides were awesome and worth the long waitConsWhen we went in Feb, the park was only opened during the weekendWaiting time averaged at around 45 mins for some of the big thrill ridesThe line for food places like Panda Express were just as busy (i think i waited 20 mins in the line for Panda Express and there were four cash registers only at the time)A lot of walking involved (especially when you are getting from one thrill ride to the next)For one of the rides, you HAD to put your bag in a locker which was a $1 for one hour but for some of the other rides, you can just put it to the sideTip: Get there early and make sure you priortise your rides and ride the big thrill ones first.",Lee

To bad The whole area was packed with people, so hours with wanting is a must. Furthermore I have to say I have never In my life mingled with so many different folks at The same place and setting. Never had so Much fun as When I was laughing to death with some gang banger, as When we we were heading towards certain death( or so we tought)! that I reccomend this place to all folks.",alextorpbkk
50,Felt like a kid again!,"My husband and I took our 16 year old niece as it was somewhere she had been wanting to go. My husband and I like roller coaster, but had not been to an amusement park since in our early 20's so were a bit skeptical about how we would fare. We got there early as we were trying to avoid as much lines as possible. We waited for the gate to open and headed to Revolution first. It was amazing and from then on we couldn't wait until the next ride. We were very fortunate to not wait any longer than 30 minutes for any ride. We rode a total of 9 roller coasters and loved every minute of it. We even did Superman twice!! My favorite coasters were Revolution, Superman, and Goliath. If you like coasters this is the place to go. Side note: if you are not into coasters you may want to go elsewhere as most of the rides are for thrill seekers.",travelforfun2233
50,SIX FLAGS MAGIC MOUNTAIN,"Visited here on Christmas Eve, and was pleasantly surprised. I enjoyed the experience as much as the kids.

Well worth the drive there.",Sam5LovesToTravel

50,Roller Coasters!,"I love roller coasters and this was the place for me! I had seen online that this six flags had a bunch of roller coasters, but I was pleasantly surprised at how many enjoyable roller coasters there were. Almost all of the roller coasters there are top notch and amazing. There were only a couple downsides in that twisted collossus wasn't done and screamin was out for maintenance and the line times were longer than expected (and longer than the estimated line time indicated). However, I still had a blast and the staff was extremely friendly.",A R
50,Thrills and Thrills and more Thrills,"Roller Coaster fans everywhere need to visit this park. I've been almost 15 times and it never gets old. They add new rides often, have great deals on admission, and if a ride has no line you get to ride it over and over again. Staff is friendly, facilities are well kept, and price is very reasonable. If you're 14 + and taller than 52"" get over to Magic Mountain before your'e too old.Hint: Bring 15+ people and admission can be as low as $30 a person!",socalkid714
30,"Great rides, poor enforcement of line jumping","I was there and it was rainy so there were a lot of the big coasters that were shut down. Not much you can do about the weather, but one thing that really annoyed me was the amount of line jumping I saw while waiting in line for 1.5-2 hrs on a lot of coasters. There was no enforcement of the no line jumping policy that was posted all over every line there. Otherwise it was a good experience and the coasters are some of the best in the world.",TravelingJohnB80
30,Roller Coaster Maniac,This is a place for Roller Coaster fans. It has the most roller coasters than any other theme park in the world. Rainy days caused the theme park to stop operating quite a number of rides.Overall experience is quite pleasant.,rudy_setiawan
40,Fun time,Visited with my 20-something children for old times sake! We had a blast. Used the premium fast pass and went on 12 rides in 6 hours.,Islander642
40,Legendary,"It was my first time here, and I have to say, it was a great experience when I was actually on the rides. For the most part some of the rides were under maintenance and some of them were not working for extended times throughout the day. For example, the ride Tatsu was down for about two hours before they let people back on and then later again it was down for another hour, which was a bummer. The best ride there has to be the X2. Everything was good except for the customer service at one of the inside food places, I think it was called BBQ house or something. The food was good though.",ErikReviews
50,Pricey Thrills,"I grew up loving this place still today.I recall prices $7-10 to get in, now a soaring years salary for a family of four, and make sure to pack a lunch. One thing for sure, you are going to have an exciting time once in the park with all the thrill seeking rides. My adrenaline rush of a good drop keeps me coming back for more!",Melanie B
50,Teenage or Thrill Seeker Land! Lol,"If you have teens in your group or thrill seekers this is definitely a must!Make sure each one takes a back pack with extra clothes just in case you get soaked cause some of the rides are on water. There's food in there but alot of people go out of the park down the street to Wendy's for fast food. But if you want to sit down to a meal there's Red Lobster, El Toritos and also a Marie Callendar restaurants on The Old Rd and Magic Mountain Pkwy. I hope this review helps....oh and although they have some kiddie rides this is definitely not a place for little ones unless you have someone watching them while you ride. That can get pretty boring and tiring for both the adult in charge of watching them and the kids. Summer time weather in Santa Clarita can get VERY HOT so it might be a better idea for them to stay behind in the hotel with AC ;-)",Camareb
40,Great budget friendly family outing!!,"For way less money then one day at Disneyland, I was able to get year passes for both 6 Flags and their water park Hurricane Harbor!!",chandrasmith69

50,Thrills are found here!,"Husband and I came here since I love roller coasters. It's the number one roller coaster park in the country for a reason. I had done my research and knew to start at the big rides. Tastu is in the top 5 on my list of best roller coasters. And we did it first so we only had to wait 15 minutes. X2 was closed but again after reading up on the park it usually is so I wasn't too disappointed. We did 8 roller coasters in four hours before calling it a day. We have been to other six flags and know to expect high food prices but if you plan for it you will have an awesome day. Staff was nice, park was clean.",BetsyC10384
30,Amazing rides but horrible experience,"Would rate most rides 6/5, but the overall is experience is very poor. Disorganised, slow poor service and long wait times for food etc.well worth the visit for a thrill seeker, but make sure you grab a flash pass to fully experience this huge park.",FionnOLeary
30,Good rides but poor park management leads to unnecessarily long waiting times,"I had high expectations of a great theme park day based on previous experiences at Universal Studios and Disney in Florida. While some of the rides here were perhaps more hair-raising than the above, the park management ultimately led to a disappointing day. After 11am the wait time for the top three rides - X2, Full Throttle and Tatsu was always over 1.5 hour the whole day and night. Even more infuriating for me as a single rider was seeing lots of photos to buy from these rides with empty seats because the park did not offer single rider lines on their top rides - meaning that everyone had to wait even longer because the carriages were not full. This was very poor decision making by the park management and that, combined with the general two star feel of the grounds (toilets frequently blocked, grubby wash areas and poor lighting of both walkways and rides after dark) means that I will not be seeking out another six flags venue, which is a shame because the rides, once you got on them after the interminable wait, were fun.",Muso22

40,Superb Thrill,"One of the best places to enjoy in los angeles..Most of the games are roller coasters with different thrilling ways to enjoy. .Should be there at earliest possible to avoid the long queues at parking, main entrance, security checks, sub entrance to the games' park and finally to purchase fast track device.. it took from us 3.5 hours..Park is open in weekends only, so that you can see long queues and so crowd..From my opinion, there is no proper management of entrances.. Although purchased Platinum Pass , but you get limited priority to some games and one priority to others while some other games required extra payment..Overall satisfied and enjoyed the time in six flags",Hassan H
50,Thrilling!!!!!,I love this place!! Went on Vday with my husband. Decided to do something a little different. We had such an Amazing time. Pretty much did all the rides within 4 hours. Then the place started getting full of people. Everyone there is super friendly and helpful.,Stephanie L

Lines do get long, especially on holidays or the weekends, so it can be a wait for some rides, so if you can go on a weekday before kids are out for summer vacation or spring break, no problem! We got on everything twice by going during the week, barely any wait time at all! Sometimes AAA or grocery stores have special promotions for ticket prices so keep your eye out and you may be able to score a discount. You can also check the Six Flags Magic Mountain web site to see if there are any deals.",D W
30,Meeh!,The rides at the park are thrilling and fun. The upkeep of the park is very lackluster. The grounds were dirty. We entered the park at 10:00 AM and there was trash in planters and strewn around the floor. Seemed they had not cleaned up the night before.,Puny S
50,Something for everyone to enjoy.,"First year that the park gets decorated and events for the holidays where incorporated and they did a great job. It was fun to hang out with Santa, reindeers,see all the beautiful lights and snow falling. The holiday food and treats that were being offered were all full of deliciousness.",Dozoara
30,Typical So Cal amusement park,"Only been 2 times, both a long time ago, When it first opened, it was OK the food was nothing special. 2nd time it got better. But now it's in it's 5th or 6th iteration. I've heard stories of riots and crime that doesn't get reported in the local media. So dunno if that's brought under control.I've heard they tore down a big coaster there and they're building a new one. So unless you're willing to make the trek out to Santa Clarita (like en route to the Central Valley) visit Disneyland or Knotts first, or visit the local Six Flags near you I'll bet it's pretty much the same experience.",Surprisedtraveler
50,Fun in the Sun,"Magic Mountain is still one of my favorite places to go for some quick thrills and a day of fun in the sun. They continue to bring in new and exciting attractions and I love the rollercoasters....all of them! The food is still pretty pricey, but you can bring some snacks or exit the park and have a picnic or eat at on of the restaurants that are close by. Being a local resident, during the summer months we would often go for a family evening on Friday nights. Easy to get a allot of rides in with the kids, it's cool out, and perfect for getting some ice cream or deserts to top off the evening!",Paul J
30,Teenage Paradise,"This place is just too hard core for me. It is primarily made up of white knuckle, guts spilling rides that I have no use for. It is definitely a teenage place known for attracting a certain type of person. It is expensive and if you are a parent of young kids, you still have to pay the astronomical entry fee for you even if you are only spending the day in the kids' area. Not only that but the adults are not allowed on the kids' rides. Waste of time.",SGierahn
20,Great roller coasters but I always leave feeling ripped off.,"Last time I bought a $90 VIP pass. Turned out, the two most popular coasters cost an extra $15 each on top of the $90. When I go without a pass I waste most of my time in line. And I only go off-peak. If there's 2 lines for a ride during peak, they'll only be one line for off-peak. That way they can ensure you have a bad experience. If you're a coaster enthusiast, go on an overcast weekday in February. But don't be surprised if half the rides are closed.",Charles Z
40,Not as much of a desire to ride the thrill rides like I did when I was younger,"I couldn't have ridden a faster, steeper rollercoaster in my younger years. Now, being 53, I don't like the rides as much as I used too.If you're into rollercoasters, this is the place to be, as Disneyland is more for entertainment and family fun.",Diane B
50,Tons of fun and excitement,Used fast pass and was worth every penny.Recently they started serving alcohol in the park and that has lead people getting sick on rides more frequently as day progresses. Had an awesome time rode everything. Worth the money. Go at beginning of summer on a weekday before schools are out.,Alkuhni

40,"Great Fun, bring a big helping of Patience and ZEN.........","Six Flags is great fun, especially for the roller coaster freaks. The cut in line timer is worth the extra money,. allows you to reserve your time on a ride, and then just show up and get in the closest line position. We do not get the VIP, to expensive, and everyone looks at you with a glare if you make them wait and cut right onto the attraction.It's always crowded, so come with the correct mindset, remember, the kids love it always.Day food pass is actually a good deal if you have more than 4 in your group. One price for all the food and drinks that day.",FreeMarco13
40,Thrill Rides Galore!,"The only downside are the lines, damn they are long! But if you don't mind waiting....ITS PERFECT! (GET THE FLASH PASS!!)The upside is, its the best place to get your adrenaline roller coaster rush! Wow! Some of these are absolutely intense!There are some kids rides, but the majority of the rides have a height restriction so its not the best for younger kids.I would double check to make sure the park is open on the day you want to go because of they have an off season and on season. Only certain times of the year is the park open everyday, the off season (usually in the winter) its open only on weekends.There is also a bungee jumping experience.The food is a combination of fair food (fried things) and funnel cake and the regular pizza, hot dog, etc.Be careful....if you eat wait before you go on some of those rides...or else you will end up throwing up all over everyone.Sometimes you may get throw up on you, hasnt happened to me...but I have seen it on others.DO NOT TAKE BULKY BACKPACKS and other big items. Try to pack as small as possible some most rides you have to take off all glasses, bags, and hats and store them in a locker before you can go on the ride.Its filled with teenagers with unlimited adrenaline who often yell and laugh non stop in your ear...if you have kids or are a teenager..its perfect...as an adult, it may be annoying",Margarita S
50,A fun day for those that have stomach for it.,"This Park is amazing, the rides are excellent and there's a ride that suits what most people want.My Tips,Either buy your ticket online early or get it from a nearby Hotel if your staying overnight.Go in the off season - We had no lines for any of the rides - Didn't have to waste any money the Flash pass.Get there early, you have to pay for parking but the early you get there, the closer you are to the entry.When you line up at the gate, don't form one line, take a look around, they actually open all the gates all the way along the entrance.If your at the front of the line, get to the X2 first, by far the most popular as everyone wants to go on it first. By getting that ride out of the road, it puts you ahead of the wave people going around the park.Have fun, the only issue I had was after a 4 or 5 rides I was feeling a little bit queasy, I put that down to being on a ride after ride in short time period, as there was no waiting in the lines.Have fun.",Stephen G
40,Older Kids Loved It,"We took our grandkids ages 16, 13, and 10. The two older kids loved all the crazy rollercosters. It was a bit much for the younger one and there did not seems to be ebough rides for him. However, it was a great family experience.",Connie H

It took over 45 minutes just to get into the park and we have passes. We only rode 3 coasters as each line was nearly an hour long. We were going to get a meal, but given the long wait of probably another 45 minutes we opted to just leave. If we had purchased tickets we probably would have stayed, but given the long lines it was just not worth our time which was too bad since our daughter had not been since she was a toddler and it was her first time to experience the great coasters. A big disappointment for us.",Stacy F

50,Get the Flash Pass,"The flash pass is well worth the expense. While Disneyland and CA Adventure Park are more expensive than Six Flags the feature I like is their Skip the Line perk. The Flash Pass allows you to make a reservation, one at a time, and the most we waited was 30 mins for an open reservation. Actual line time varied from 5 mins- 15 mins max.If you're going to spend the $ for your tix, at least get to enjoy the high caliber rides they have. Gold Pass is what we had and was just fine. It allowed us to catch our breath and reorient after the rides. Best rides are X2, Tatsu, Superman (soo glad we bypassed the 1 hr wait for these rides).They have healthy food options and prices are what you'd expect for a theme park.",Dan F
50,Awsome!!!,"The park is 30 mins from L.A. It could do with a bit more manteinence, but its ok. The food and stores are like in most amusement park and all just seems fake. But who cares??!!!! It has amazing rides!! One after another they just keep getting better and better! Try to go in winter time and you get 10 min waits! It was a thrill. Not recomended for kids under 12 or people that dont like roller coasters. Its not like other parks that have ""soft"" rides aswell. Check offers online cause you always have great deals for tickets!",Alexsanchezdiez

Even though you know everything is going to be OK at the end of the ride you still can't stop telling yourself what am i doing on this ride! Best time to go is between Monday and Thursday smaller crowd means more rides you can get on more than once. Highly recommend if you haven't been there to go. The price for one day is reasonable for the amount of attractions you will ride. And buy your tickets online you will get a better price but if you live a few hours away a season pass is the way to go.Have fun!",Daniel V
50,Season Pass value,"It's always best if you don't have a season pass yet to purchase around late September and always in sets of 4 or more to get the most value and perks. The park itself is clean , has a diverse group of rides and attractions, while maintaining a reasonable code of conduct. If spending time with family and friends who have a season pass or will pay for one day admission, pick a day when there is no bring a free friend promotion occurring as it will double guest attendance.If treating a friend or family member on those days arrive early as to maximize the day. The food is as diverse as the rest of the park with pizza, panda express, bbq and even healthy fit food on site.As with anh theme park you will experience 5-60 minute waits, but planning ahead helps alot and the park has more thrill rides than almost all parks nationwide.Go Six Flags, even toddlers have their own kid roller coasters if they dare.",Erica C
50,Great Rides Good Times,I love this park. I have Gold Passes for me and my boys and we come as often as possible. The free parking with the pass is awesome. Can't wait for the summer so we can take advantage of Hurricane Harbor which is included with the Gold Pass.,Patricia D
50,outstanding experience,"My family had the best time here at six flags magic mountain.the service was great, the food was good, and the rides were all unique and thrilling. If you are planning on going here I definitely recommend tatsu, full throttle, and goliath after you have ""warmed up"" with revolution and viper. Overall a great experience!!",Mitchell M
40,Fun day with the siblings.,"I arrived on Saturday, a spare of the moment thing. I honestly expected to a bit tiring, and the wait in line to take long. However, the wait in line was very fast, my two sisters and I some how seemed to pick, the right rides at the right moment. I think it helped that we came during a slower time of the year. I was glad, because, was finally able to ride Tatsu for the first time since it was add as an attraction. It was a fun experience and I felt very safe and secure. In my opinion the ride is supposed feel like your falling slightly, and because of that, I felt like I was flying. I could help but just laugh on every ride I went on that the park, but Tatsu was definitely the best. I rate this experience very high and definitely recommend it. It was a little costly for a young college student like myself and that would be my only problem, other then that every thing was awesome.",Jesus R
50,Best thrills in SoCal,I was a season pass holder for years then I got married and it stopped. Recently divorced; visited Six Flags Saturday and loved it! I'm glad Magic Mountain is still there for me LOL and oh yeah! I bought the season pass=),Cindy R
50,Roller Coaster Heaven,"I've been here few years ago and was already the top roller coaster park, if you wanna fly go upside down than quickly drop here is the place.You don't have time to get bored as the park as a record breaking 19 roller coaster !!",Simone
50,Big rides for big kids,"Disneyland is for people with younger kids. But this park is for older kids who want really thrilling heart stopping rides. I enjoy the newer rides using a body harness but there are more thrills in a traditional roller coaster using a lap bar! If you visit Southern California, you have to go here, Disneyland, Universal Studios, Knotts' Berry Farm and Lego Land.",aisle67
50,This was our first time visiting SixFlags,We had so much fun and the wait times were surprisingly short on all the rides considering the anmount of people at the park. They made my 11 year old feel safe on even the scariest rides.. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PARK TO ANYONE WHO IS THINKING ABOUT GOING,Carmen M
50,Amazing,"Much better than Disneyland! They have a great kids area, along with the best roller coasters ever built!",GreatAmericanCoaster
30,i don't like fast ride,I gave this review 3 star so it won't go either way.I don't like fast ride so I wont review the whole thing. the bark look good it bit disorganized but it's ok for this type of places my sister enjoyed it.I think if you like fast ride this the place to go,AWF82
50,Bugs Bunny World 2015,"Unlike anything I would have imagined. Perfect for our 4 year old and rivals to the better of Disneyland and Knott's. Plenty to do as BBW has been completely revamped and a much cleaner and safe atmosphere then several years ago when we were last there. Granted we got lucky with the lines (there weren't any on a holiday weekend, MLK). A must experience for any parent!",CynJ22
50,bang for the buck,"First off, i bought my tickets online and saved myself $20 on each one. This park is the best, better than Disney land if your going with children over age of 10. The thrill rides are worth the wait but to be honest they go by quicker than you'd expect. The food is expensive but its not everyday that you go to six flags magic mountain.",Sonia P
50,Great family fun!,Six Flags has great rides! My 7 year old and I went on 8 rides in 4 hours! No lines! Definitely going to use our season pass to go back again!,lisa c

50,Thrilling fun!,This is my first visit to a Six Flags establishment and it was a great fun. We managed to ride all coasters but Apocalypse. That was on a Monday. X2 was the best coaster in this park hands down.,Rudolf H
40,Astonishing experience,"I recommend this to all people looking for fun, adrenaline and a good time. Do not recommend to buy the ""Tamagotchi"" bypass from Mo-Fri, becuse there are not enough people to stay hours on a line. You can save lot o money by doing this.Want to have a good unforgettable time? Go on!",Mrawesomeastur
50,Amazing!,Best theme park! The flash pass is definitely worth the extra $$ especially on busy days. Plenty of car parking and easy to get to. If in LA this theme park is a must for roller coaster enthusiasts.,monica v
40,Great Experience!,"We went for halloween and it was amazing zombies everywhere! We is very easy to get there and the roller coaster are amazing! Food is good, price is average. It was full but not super packed! We will go for sure again!",Ginavm7
10,"""Wait-Time Capital of the World!"" We could only fit in 7 rides in a 9.5 hour period","We visited the park on 12/28 during our West coast trip from Boston and found it to be one of the worst theme part experiences we have ever had. We stayed from open to close and were only able to go on 7 rides during a 9.5 hour period! It seemed as though half of the rides weren't being 100% utilized and numerous rides had operational difficulties that either extended wait times or caused us to leave line altogether.For our family of 5 this equated to $32.00/ride, while I'll say the the rides that we were able to go on were great--they need to set up the lines/rides to handle the capacity better. I can't even imagine what it would be like in the Summer.Every ride-estimate time was grossly wrong by 30 minutes or more. One roller coaster--Scream said wait time was 90 minutes and was only 5 mins, the others said 30-60 minutes and all were over 60 and a few were over 90 minutes and one was 2 hours.We actually switched out a day at Disney and wish we hadn't made the change. Granted Disney has lines but at least they keep you moving or entertained along the way. Here there was nothing other then waiting and more waiting, and then delays due to operational issues...I'd save your money, unless you have 2-3 days to try to get on all the rides....",jeffpags
50,Definitely a place you have to go at least once in your lifetime,"I have a membership to Six Flags because my husband and I can not get enough. Its a great place to go to spend time with your family, bond with a loved one, and be thrilled to amazing levels. Great prices, great people and great rides",Ashley R
50,Best amusement park value in SoCal,"The Season Pass is the best value of all the SoCal amusement parks. $75 for both Magic Mountain & Hurricane Harbor + free parking for the year when we bought 2 passes in September, so we actually get a year and a third. We also can go to other 6 flags parks for free, and we are planning a Discovery Kingdom visit. I have a teenager, so this is a great deal if you are into roller-coasters, but if not there is not much for non thrill seekers (my wife loves Knott's, but won't do Magic Mountain). Depends on your interest.",Lawrence H
40,Thrill Capital of the World,Completely satisfied with our visit to magic mountain. The length of waiting time for roller coasters were 15-20 minutes tops which allowed us to see and do everything planned for the days visit. We even got to ride our favorite rides more than once. The new ride Full Throttle totally lives up to what the advertisement previews to the population.,paez18
50,Best thrill rides ever!,Six Flags was the best theme park I visited on the west coast of the states. All the rides are so thrilling and we never queued for more than half an hour. X2 and Tatsu were terrifying but I'm glad I went on them! Not as many food options as there are at other theme parks but we bought our own snacks and didn't want to eat too much before going on the roller coasters anyways!,whopdedoo
40,Best theme park ever,"We went on a Monday and it was quiet, little waiting anywhere, and no more than 20 minutes on any ride. We had prepurchased tickets online for a discount and the 3 teenage boys in our party were determined to ride all the rides they had researched. They did and were really happy. The timid mum went on some medium ranked rides and enjoyed them. We were ther until it closed and so busy people actually skipped food!",Lyn N
40,Amazing Roller Coasters,"We went as a family of four on 9th January with our two teenage daughters. The park was very quiet and a normal entry pass was fine. There was almost no waiting on any of the rides. Had the park been busy a flash pass would have been needed. This park is really for roller coaster lovers. The roller coasters were awesome and five star. We have deducted a star as the park itself is tired and lacking ambience and really does not cater for non roller coaster riders. Funnel cakes were iconic and really cool - can recommend the cookies and cream but you only need one to feed the family. Have it after you ride!! Our favourite rides were the Tatsu, the Batman and the Goliath. The X2 is worth doing because it's just so different. The Green Lantern was not enjoyable. I came off sore and so did many others exiting the ride and the ride itself was unpleasant. You can take your own water in and there were drinking fountains throughout the park which you could use to refill your bottles. The staff were polite and friendly throughout. All in all a must go to park for roller coaster lovers and a good day out.",RedCollette
40,travel guru,"This is by far the best park I have visited, the rides are awesome and impressive, i was lucky to go the second week after new year and mid week so no lines and able to get on any rides in 5 minutes or less, it made the experience enjoyable. The strong rides do make you feel a bit woozy with the G's they generate so take it easy and pace yourself with easier rides in between and off course dont eat to much before attending the park. Park and rides are clean and well maintained, staff friendly and food options a bit on the junk food side but ok. Parkingmis 20 dollars so be aware of this. Discount tickets for buying online also available. Colussus was been remodeled so closed. Check with park to make sure all rides are open.",DIDIERGOLF
40,Rollercoasters ++,Great day visiting with our teenagers...Very quiet in terms of people but still some lines for the top 5.Food as others mentioned is extensive but I found cyber cafe not bad. Reasonable coffee and treats prices.Some of the rides cost extra which is disappointing plus a decent number not operating. Need to have that information when you enter and save some walking. Also $20 for parking is ridiculous particularly for a attraction which is way out of town. Cost $10 of fuel to get there so why $20. Universal studios in the hat of the City is cheaper!,LozzaCam
50,Best park for rollercoasters,This is my absolute favourite when it comes to themeparks!I am an adrenaline addict and simply love the rush you experience.Lots and lots of world-class coasters!!!!!Buy a pass to skip the lines. We did and it worked perfectly.I have never been to any park even close to what they offer here!,Kimmen1
40,Get the Platinum Flash pass,"We went to the front of the lines for all the rides and rode twice on most of them without having to get off the coasters. We went on Goliath, Batman, Superman, Riddlers Revenge, Tatsu (my favorite), Full Throttle (mostly hype), Scream, X2, new coasters cost extra for Flash passes. We got on all the rides we wanted to in 7 hours with a lunch break. It's expensive but worth it if you don't like standing in long lines.",fitnesswla
50,I was freeze!!!!,"I was really freeze, which help us to access later on the night a lot of rides as everybody was looking for other rides more ""warm"" hehehehe.We bought the annual pass, and enjoyed a lot of rides... however, you need a lot of time to be able to ride all the attractions there. There is a system of fast pass (witch cost obviously), the only issue with it is how it works... if you buy it the normal fast pass, you have to reserve and wait the usual time in the queue (of course, you are not in the queue), but having eight hours of time, and the queue being one hour waiting, you can use it only eight times... there other options, but an expensive prices. Anyway a great place to go!!! and if you like to wait in the queues, this is the place.!!!!",Hector E
50,Winter Wonderland Experience,"Despite the cold weather, my family and I wanted to experience the 1st annual Holiday in the Park. I must say that we were impressed. We really didn't go for the rides, however the few rides that we did get on, the wait time was short. I would definitely renew my family's passes to experience this again!",Ivery5
50,Awesome place for thrills and great family park.,"Took my niece here for the first time and we had a great time. Friendly staff and lots of things to do. I have been going here since I was a kid. I'm 34 now and would say the park has improved dramatically over the years. It's a great place to go, and their thrill rides are some of the best I have been on.",Manuel P
50,Awesome Day :),"We went here as a family of 4 visiting from Australia. This park was truly fantastic and was everything that we expected, and more. we had every intention of buying the flash passes on our arrival, however decided not to due to the amount of people in the park. Best decision as we waited no longer than 45 mins for any particular ride. Most rides are not for the faint hearted and are quite 'extreme', however that is what we were there for, and we're not disappointed. Being on a mountain, there is quite a bit of walking up and down stairs and steep hills between rides, but would highly recommend this place for anyone after a great day out. Food prices were expensive, but certainly on par with all of the other theme parks we have visited on our stay here.",Simbec1973
50,A must for roller coaster enthusiasts!!,"This is the place to go for those who love roller coasters! We cannot comment on the rides for the younger kids as we went only on the bigger rides. Bought our tickets and parking pass online, which saves you some money, especially on the park ticket. Also went on a weekday, and therefore felt no need to buy a fast pass. We went on every ride that we wanted to (leaving the park by 5:30 PM) , but the fast pass would have saved us some time, therefore allowing us the opportunity to go on some of our favourites again. When we entered the park we asked the attendant which was the most popular ride, wanting to hit this first before the lines started to get bigger. He said 'X2' which was to the left of the entrance. The other nice thing about this was that it allowed us to make one continuous clockwise circle hitting all the rides that we wanted to go on. The longest wait was for 'X2"" (about 45 mins. just after the park opened), but the wait was well worth it! This is without a doubt a roller coaster like no other! You have to do this one at least once-an experience not to miss. Tatsu was another favourite giving you the feeling that you are flying like Superman. Definitely the park to go to for the ones with older kids who like the bigger rides.",Simon L

40,Food costs too high for quality and quantity,Rides were as expected. Food was excessively overpriced and quality severely lacking. Ordered a double cheeseburger from Johnny rockets and it was not even close to what you get at their regular locations. Spent over $100 on 2 meals and a couple of snacks for 2 teens and myself...ouch!,YoHoYoHo
50,great family time at magic mountain,Had a wonderful fun time with family at magic mountain. We were there celebrating my nephews 9th birthday. And also took advantage of the parks holiday events.,Patricia C
50,Always great place for the family,"Our daughters have grown up going to six flags since 1999 and the park has always made an effort to improve its offerings in rides, seasonal offerings such as fright fest, and food choices. This years holiday in the park was alot of fun and a great addition to their seasonal attractions.",Gil A
50,magic mountain 6 flags,This was the finest theme park my dare devils have been to. They didn't want to leave! We went to Disneyland after 6 flags and we should have dinner it the other way around. I felt like they would have given up Disneyland and just stayed at 6 flags. But they are not even compareable. Would do it all over again since our family loves big rides! Not for those who don't!,janellostermiller
50,day trip to Magic Mountain,"Had a great time.. the ages of our kids & their spouses or significant other was 19-25.. also took our 2 yr old grand daughter (we live close & bought passes for the first time this year) so for just a couple hours of fun in the kids section it was awesome.. she was able to go on everything with a parent riding along and had a blast. The older kids did their thing and had a great time on all rinse they did. Employees were awesome, and there was a lot to see around the park.",K S
50,Alot of walking!,"The place is great, I always get my family season passes. Just be prepared on the weekends to spend most your day waiting in the longest lines you've seen. I get a handicap pass and still end up waiting over an hour to get on a ride.. So try going during the week it's a lot more fun and much less lines. The steep hills suck! Make sure you have comfortable shoes..",Sean B
50,Love this place!,"I grew up in LA and Magic Mountain has always been a great place to go for thrill seekers and families alike. I would say the only negative thing is the long lines. We paid for a flash pass (basic is $40/person). That made it easier to get on more rides. Imagine waiting 2 hours in line for every ride! Insanity I tell you. Anyway they have made some improvements over the years. It looks like the eating establishments are higher fair than most places (they added a sports bar). The stands are the usual stale fair though.I recommend this place to anyone who likes a fun time. BTW the site shows tickets from Viator, those are overpriced. Go to the Magic Mountain website.",maryfran11
50,We love Magic Mountain!,"We have been going to Magic Mountain since we were kids and happy that our kids love the place as much as we do. For kids and adults who are bored with the slow/mellow rides and long lines at Disneyland, THIS is the place to be. So many thrilling rides here--but also gentler ones for the little ones (we took our kids here when they were younger too), so something for everyone. The only slight downside is that there are not as many ""shows"" or other things to do when not wanting to go on rides as there are at D-land. Overall, we enjoy the beauty of the park too--nice landscaping (more of a natural look) with lots of trees/shade. The employees are always nice and helpful. Overall, this is a great place that we return to every year and look forward to going back to see what's new every time we go to the L.A. area. A SUPER value too if you buy a season pass as it can be used at tons of other Six Flags parks throughout the U.S. (we've also been to the parks in the Chicago and Vallejo, CA areas using our pass). One visit pays for the pass--so anything more is ""icing on the cake!"").",NAOMILP
20,Beware of holidays and cold days,"Jan 1, 2015: We entered the park when they opened and once inside found that most of the rides were still closed. Some didn't open for over two hours. Staff claimed it was due to the cold weather, but it appeared it was due to lack of advance planning and staffing (one staff member admitted such). The rides that were open had long queues. Rides ""break down"" frequently, leaving you in lines of unknown duration. Many of the common areas appear rundown. Smoking areas are right in front of restrooms, which are not clean. Note that this is not a ""Disneyland"" type park; it is for roller coaster enthusiasts only. The staff are all very young and don't seem interested in providing a good experience. Restaurant lines might not be long, but the service is extremely slow, and the food selection is very limited. Note that the coasters are very good, particularly Tatsu (spend the extra time for the front row), Goliath (250 foot drop) and Superman. There are no shows to speak of and practically no non-thrill rides.",Pat W
50,Flash Pass Rocks,Purchased the platinum flash pass and never waited in a line. Rode every ride by 5:00p. Awesome experience and great value for the experience.,Bryce B
50,So much fun!,I decided to buy my family season passes for the year. I am so glad I did. We drove down from the Bay Area. It's about a 5 hour drive. We had a great time. All the coasters were great. Lots of food options. Facilities are clean and well kept.,vacationsalot

Thank you Six Flags.,Tammy R
50,Holiday in the Park!,"This was Magic Mountain's first Holiday in the Park so we had to go check it out. It's bo where near Disneyland's Christmas experience but this is it's first year and I'm sure they're waiting for enough positive feedback to invest in more decorations for next year. It snowed in the Winter Wonderland and had beautiful lights and decorations. Christmas music played throughout the park but it was annoying. It wasn't too crowded so the lines weren't ridiculously long. We ate at Johnny Rockets and paid $13 for a burger and fries which is too much but you know this going to the park anyway. The water rides were closed, it is winter after all, and the Colosuss is being renovated. Full Throttle, the newest ride there was closed as well, not sure why. We've ridden it on a previous visit so it wasn't s big deal. I will definitely go back next year for Holiday in the Park.",thebee818

50,Flash Pass and Season Passes are beneficial,"This is coming from my 13 year old son - As a season pass holder, i've been here alot of times. I finally decided to come here for my birthday party. We decided to get the gold flash passes. TOTALLY WORTH IT. We got to go on alot of rides on a busy day and it was a fun experience putting reservations for rides. The only drawback is that you can have one only reservation at a time. The rides are legitimately awesome with my favorite one being Tatsu. Will come here again for sure!",WilsonVisit148

50,Get the fast pass,"Even though for the highest level fast pass is $100 per person it is so worth it. We got to ride every single ride on an extremely busy day, we heard other people complain that they only rode 3 or 4 rides the whole day with wait times 60-120 minutes. Get the fast pass, it is worth it. We were at the front of the line for every ride and the longest we waited to get into our fast pass lane was 7 mins and then waiting 15 to get on the actual ride. It's well worth your money and you will waste it by getting the general admission and only riding a couple rides that day. It was awesome and I truly felt bad for those who waited up to 2 hours for a ride.",Suzette M
50,Annual Pass Holder and Very Pleased!,"Get the pass if you have a family of 4. We have purchased it more than once and is an incredible value for your expense. We spend $25 bucks at the grocery store and buy bread, water, PBJ, fruit and chips then come out to the car at a designated time. Cannot bring food into park and is very expensive but if you know this ahead of time you will have more bang for your buck!",prichardson2014

Full Throttle and Goliath are awesome and are a real good time. If you have a season pass, you get to go to all the special events like Fright Fest and Holiday in the Park. If you have a season pass and come often, I suggest you buy the dining pass. It pays for itself in a few visits and you get to dine twice each visits for all of 2015.",Lew K

50,"8 Hours, 12 Rollercoaster rides, 4 Exhausted riders :)","Our family of 4 are visiting from Australia. We stayed nearby at Hilton Garden Inn Valencia Six Flags and had 1 day to ride as much as possible. Another guest at the hotel had told us she only got to ride on 1 ride in 5 hours the previous day!! We got to the park 45 minutes before opening time with our prepurchased tickets (from our hotel for $50) and headed straight to Full Throttle. There was a small technical delay but no big wait. Then we decided to line up for X2. After quite a long wait we decided we were wasting too much of our precious holiday time in the line and decided to purchase the Flash Pass. This turned out to be a great decision as we were able to ride 11 more coasters with very limited waiting times. We bought the Platinum Pass for $100 each that reduces waiting time the most, in fact we only waited at a couple of the rides, some we were able to get straight on. The Flash Pass does not get you access to X2 or Full Throttle, you have to pay an extra $15 per person per ride so keep that in mind when you get to the park. The Flash Pass also has different rides available on different days. We loved our day out at Six Flags but would highly recommend getting the Flash Pass if you have limited time like we did. We rode Revolution, Apocalypse, Gold Rusher, Superman, Green Lantern, Batman, Riddlers Revenge, Tatsu, Viper, Goliath, Scream & Full Throttle. Everyone had a different favourite, don't miss Goliath, Tatsu & Apocalypse.",TravellingMum0f2
30,Ride the coasters and get out!,"The coasters are awesome! Thrill seeking to the max! Getting the Flash pass is 100% worth the money - you barely wait and can basically ride whatever you want when you want to ride it. Not getting the Flash pass is a death sentence because the park is dirty, the people are rude and other than the rides the atmosphere is old and worn out. Food options aren't the greatest even for a theme park but surprisingly the staff is nice and very helpful. Not a lot of families more like teenagers hanging out for the day than a family fun park. But again, the thrill rides are top notch! Pay the money, get the pass and you can ride all the great rides in less than a full day!",Marlene F
50,holiday in the park,My son and I had a great time at six flags...full throttle and green lantern were awesome and the lines were reasonable considering how close to the holiday we are!,B_Ruiz2014
50,Best Amusement Park EVER!!,"I love this amusement park! My husband and I bought the dining pass and discovered if you go at least 10 times in a year, for the full day, you're pass pays for your food completely, and anything after that, would wind up not costing you anything, thanks to the dining pass! I love all of the rides, and it is definitely an amazing place to visit if you want to have lots of fun!",Cari M
50,Six Flags Rocks!,The best and biggest rides and rollercoaster' s in So cal. You want excitement you come here. Don't forget the Hurricane Harbor in summer. Totally family friendly. All the negative crowds from 14 years ago are long gone so no worries on that subject. Word of advice bring your own lunch in a portable ice box to keep in your car as the food inside the park is not really worth the price (pizza place I'm looking at you! Lol!) They have a nice little picnic area in the parking lot where you can take a break from all the rides and crowds to enjoy a lunch with your family and friends over sandwiches or whatever. Don't forget to get your hand stamped before you exit the park! It really is a nice park.,Jesse G
50,AMAZING!,Recently went for their holiday decorations. Just wonderful! Rides are amazing and customer service is usually good. Unfortunately on this trip they weren't so kind but the previous one they were. I giant a season pass so definitely looking forward to more visits to this awesome place!,BadWolf1989
50,Best theme park I've visited!!,"Was unbelievable, I loved every minute of it. The rides were amazing and I loved the superhero theme. While we were there it was coming up to Halloween so there was a zombie theme going on also, was so cool. The rides were amazing super high and thrilling.",Lucy0103
40,Secret to a great visit is to arrive early,"I had a look at the other TripAdvisor reviews for this attraction and took from there a couple of tips i put into use that made my day the best.1. The cars are allowed in 1 he=r before the park opens be sure to be there at this time to secure parking near the entrance.2. if your a gold or platinum pass member they let you into the park 15mins before everyone else , entrance at the far right .3. If you won a discovery card take it as they also give you a special fast entry area on the left hand side of the entrance.Within the first hour of the park opening ( we got the 15min early entry ) we had ridden 3 coasters and by 12pm we had ridden 7 . after 12pm things stated to get busy so by 4pm we had only managed 10 coasters and would have done more but a few were breaking down in the afternoon. This was on Saturday the 20th , no flash pass needed just early entry and get the majority of your rides done in the first two hours.",bvlynch
10,"Disturbingly unsafe, poorly trained staff","I took my family there as my kids are older and wanting more of a thrill than Disneyland.we went on the X-2. I did not feel secured in there and was horrified that the girl barely checked us. I was seated loosely in the restraint and was tossed around and hit my head a few times, causing a concussion.You cannot walk five steps there without smelling weed, the problem I have with this is many seemed to be staff. They are disorganized, inattentive and seem too young for the responsibility.I met another woman there that day who also had a head injury from the X2.",Subarunatic
50,If you are not a coward,"I enjoyed my staying here. We were 5 people. We couldn't get a ride on each of them. It takes you min.60 mins in a queue. But if you take a single queue, then 20-30 mins. The drawback is that you're not with your couple or sibling.Make sure you are sober and you'd better not have any food. It is not a good idea to spread your food (whatever it was) everywhere and on everyone. Keep your belongings away. There are lockers not everywhere. Careful with cameras. You'll surely drop it from the sky. I got mine, but it was in the Collossus. The speed is not high. You must try Superman. 7 sec and you're in the sky. 100 high.I didn't have a ride at night. From about 22 rides I had only 7. No time, unfortunately.Lots of places to eat, drink, smoke, play, charge cellphones.",Kamo P
50,Magic Mountain is the greatest fun park in the world,"Magic Mountain has many great classic and state-of-the-art roller coasters and a nice balance of kid and family rides, then this is the park for you.

40,You had better like roller coasters!,"You had better like roller coasters because they are what Magic Mountain is all about! We went during the summer and the lines are long and it...is...HOT!!! Shade while waiting is at a premium on most of the rides until you reach the actual ride approach. I live in Sacramento California, so we are not strangers to heat and sunshine, and it can be pretty rough so bring water and drink plenty of it.I won't get into specific coasters, suffice it to say some are better than others, some are faster and wilder but all are good fun. One thing that I don't get at Magic Mountain that I do get in other parks is a ""Coaster Headache"". Even the fastest of them are very smooth and don't batter your head back and forth. Okay...specific coaster...The Goliath is awe-inspiring and take the extra time to wait for the front seats because that first drop is a uniquely outstanding experience!",Bruce M
50,Memebership makes it so easy,"I have had a memberships for two years and a season pass for eight. The whole family loves to come here, they have rides and entertainment for all ages. Its a blast and very affordable for this family of five. We all are member and my c/c is charge $30 dollars a month which is well worth it that includes free parking every visit, we go as a family at least once a month and the older kids go with their friend all the time during school breaks.

30,Best roller coasters in the world - but oh those lines!,"We last came here a few years ago, and it was great then, but it's even better now as they have added a lot of new roller coasters. However the lines for all rides were too long - especially for the newer rides like Full Throttle!. We wish we had brought the fast passes now so we didn't have to line up for so long. I will say though that the rides we did go on (tatsu, goliath, X2, superman, and a few others) were out of this world and truly really amazing.",Adventurejunkie4
50,Great day,"We really enjoyed our trip to Six Flags. We got Flash Passes for our children which was great later in the day, but we all enjoyed the rides with short lines until early evening. I thought the holiday entertainment was great with lights, snow and singing. Some people are concerned with safety, but we had no concerns at all. I think it is a great park, especially for people who like more extreme rides.",casolo
50,Family fun at Magic Mountain,"I have had a season pass for Magic mountain in the past and consider it the best place for great ride. I remember thinking I couldn't wait until my niece and nephew were big enough to ride all the good ride. This weekend I took both of them and we had a blast. Tatsu by far won best ride of the night. Who ever thought of that ride is a genius!!! Not only is it totally thrilling but very comfortable. The way you are in the seat and latched in and then turned upside down is amazingly comfortable, you feel weightless and your head doesn't get banged all around. Overall fantastic time!!!",akapooperina
30,Should have been a highlight but...,"The rides here look amazing but sadly we had little chance to go on them. We arrived at 10 and by 4 we had been on 3 rides as the queues were that bad. One ride we queued up for 2 hours, were nearing the front when they shut it! No advance tickets for those in the queue! The queue for the ladies toilets took 45 minutes. My kids were extremely upset and i was very disappointed, least of all as it was a complete waste of money and an extremely frustrating day. I would of course give 1 star for my experience but if it was better managed it might have been a 5 so went for 3. You can buy various priority tickets but the only ones worthwhile cost $100 each. I went to complain and was given 2 front of line tickets but really they should have a maximum capacity for the park. Very disappointing day.",Blahdeblah
30,If you wear glasses.....,"This is no doubt an awesome amusement park, despite the relatively harsh weather (cold in winter, super hot in summer). But they will make you take off your glasses for the best rides which then become dull.",CarmichaelVentura
50,Insane,"It´s an amazing visti you have to do when you go to California! The rides provides the best thrills ever! If it´s raining, maybe some rides will not be open but don´t let it go because of this. The park will be very empty and you'll enjoy most of the rides with no problems.",ulr1chbra
50,One of our favorite amusement parks,"After Universal Orlando and Cedar Point Ohio, this is an amazing amusement park - if you like roller coasters. I wouldn't really recommend taking young kids there even though they do have some little kid rides. You will be walking up and down hills to rides they can't even get on. But for everyone else, go for it! Some lines are very long but you can almost walk straight onto the older rides. And all are a lot of fun. Best to go during the off season though. Have fun!",RockyMtn11
50,Oh what a ride!,"I truly enjoyed my recent visit to Magic Mountain. I would highly recommend either an adult or a child over 10 yrs old enter the ride last, if you have a young child. Some of the kiddie rides operate at speeds that are safe but will have the passengers sliding. I saw a thin little girl on the scrambler (unaccompanied) just sliding from one side to another, she looked terrified. I am sure if an adult or teenager had been with her she would've enjoyed herself.As for everyone else, bring your sunblock, bottled water, a light sweater(if you visit during fall/winter), a small backpack if you visit frequently for your refill buckets/cups. And have a blast on some awesome rides... .especially X2! Just do NOT take ANY loose items, you can not leave them on the platform like you can on other rides. YOU WILL NOT BE ALLOWED ON THE RIDE.",Jeanne A
50,Ossum Rides,"We went there during Halloween and they pimped the place up really nice and spooky and they open up the rides till even after midnight! Hahha. The only cons for me would be the waiting time but once you get to go on the rides, it's mind-blowing. They are ossum! Best rides of my life!",Initrah
50,Magic Mountain Fun Day,My daughter and i visited the Sunday after Thanksgiving. We were able to get on many rides with minimal wait times possibly due to light rain during the day. The thrill rides are all great! X2 is a must but be prepared for a long wait. Try to hit that ride early.,alittlegibby

40,"Great Thrills, Wallet Drained","If you find this helpful please click the helpful link below.Six flags has some of the greatest parks on earth as any thrill seekers know.This Six Flags has had some financial trouble, has changed hands and closed down a few years back. So know ahead of time this explains in my own opinion some of the unexplainable haphazard ride issues that have hurt their reputation.That said, this park is riddled with thrills! Roller coasters dream. I cannot say enough about that... So if your like me and my kids, thats Priceless.Plan ahead: the park always offers some sort of pre-entry package, sometimes if you own a ""honda"" you get early admission, check the website.There are all kinds of 2 for 1 deals, discounts on fast passes, groupons and local vendor deals... Find one. This place is like the store that retails everything 3 times higher and has specials going on all year like buy 1 get 2 free. You'll need the deals with a family of 5!Lesson learned: just because you get a very expensive middle tiered fast past does NOT mean you can get on every ride quickly, read the fine print! We learned the 2 newest rides, YOU have to pay an additional $10 per ride and you can only ride them 2 times. Really? What a rip off and I was really mad😡. I was $650 into the day to show my kids the greatest thrill park on the earth and they want more money!!! Thats insane.You have to wait in a speed pass line and watch a silly video which no one watches which takes up 20-30 minutes because the line is so stinking long.Major alert: This place is a mountain. You will be walking up hills ALL day! These are not small hills. If its going to be a scorcher, go another day. I got sun poisoning and major dehydration - it ruined my experience completely. This place is in the desert - don't be fooled when you hear Six Flags Los Angeles. Its 45 minutes and hot. There is almost no shade.Food is Terrible here. Sneak your own in because I'm telling you its the worst Ive eaten at a park and usually they all are pretty lousy.Parking - here is the kick in the wallet again, you have to pay to park. Be prepared for that as well. Get to the park a good 40 minutes before it opens for parking, walking, and hold your place in line.Lastly, there was not a whole lotOf typical Six Flags love. Usually theirs characters and dancing and music, I think because of their financial state they cut all the budgets so its not really ""fun"" for the little ones at all.I still recommend this park like a gear head loves muscle cars. There may not be power windowsAnd locks, but hold on!",Tripking07
30,First time to this park.,"My family holds season passes to Six Flags. We were excited to visit the magic mountain park. We definitely expected more exciting rides than what we found. We have been to quite a few of the other parks. So far, this is the one we liked the least.",Whereto2next
30,GREAT RIDE - LONG LINES-,"On certain days thE park opens up for free for thousands of school kids, which make lines for up to 3 hrs. which means you can only make 3-5 ride at the day.Buying a Platin Fast pass for usd 100 extra is necessary (Rib off?), if you only come to the park very seldom.The rides are great but the food is expensive and not good. Same for Epcot, Disney etc.",Ulf T

40,Magic Time at Magic Mountain,"This is a roller coaster park and if you don't like roller coasters, you won't really get your money's worth. This is a really fun park for an adventurer like myself. The crowds can be navigated by traveling to the park at the end or the beginning of the season. The only problem is that they are not open 365 days a year, so if you get a season pass, you'll have to navigate their openings with the crowds and your availability to go to the park. The break even point for the park is to attend 4 times on a season pass to make it worth your while.",EllieRKay
50,Pretty Amazing Day,"We played the roller coaster called Full Throttle, worlds tallest and fastest looping coaster. This has as well the largest loop in the world. Then we played the Green Lantern, The first spinning coaster in the US. Of course we did as well Badman the Ride. As well the Riddle Revenge, a coster where you stand and it's the worlds tallest and fastest stand-up roller-coaster. The next one was the coster called Tatsu. This is the worlds tallest fastest and longest coaster where you are lying down - so basically you're flying like superman. We did Viper which is a nice fast coster but nothing special. And we did Goliath, this is a monster rollercoasters with 255 foot (80 meter) first drop into a 120 foot underground tunnel with approximately 130 km/h speed. Then we played the coster called Revolution this is the first rollercoasters in the world with a looping. And we play the Lex Luthor drop of doom, the worlds tallest vertical drop ride, we fall 136 meter. Last but not least we tried it X2. The worlds first five dimension coster. Here you have all the normal three dimensions, the fourth and the fifth dimensionis because your seat is in two dimensions movable. This brings you actually every time in new experience of ride. You shall buy the flash pass - than you don't need to wait in the line. And you should bring food and drinks because they are pretty expensive. All over I have to say after 23 hardcore rides - A pretty amazing day.",Peter J
30,Great but definitely needs upkeeps,"My brother and I visited Magic Mountain on a Monday (we thought it would be good to skip the weekend and go on a weekday) but we were surprised to find a HUGE amount of people at the entrance waiting for the gates to open.Once we managed to get in, we realised that the amount of people was not that much, but the problem was that the park is not very organised. In fact, there is not a lot of staff and a good number of the best rides was either closed or suffering delays.We queued for 1 hour to try the full throttle and 2 hours for the Goliath as they both had problems running.Like for everyone else, the worst part of a park is the waiting of course: who likes to wait to have a 40seconds thrill? we all do because we HAVE to but none of us really like it.Therefore this was a real turn off for us.I gave 3 out of 5 because the rides (the ones we managed to try) were absolutely amazing and we actually screamed (especially the wooden one). But I am afraid that the atmosphere was ruined by the waiting.Ps. one thing I must say: the customer service is great. I wrote a complaint letter and they immediately called me and apologized for the bad experience (also gave me a couple of free tickets). I hope next time they will be better!",Caterina Piagentini
50,My favorite park,"My family and bi attended on their friday homeschool day. We always have a blast. This time we went clockwise from the entrance around the entire park. We started with tatsu. This is the funniest ride. My wife and daughter enjoy the anaheimb park. However, my son and I much prefer mm. Its cheaper. The rides are more exciting. Recommend mm to all. Always recommend you go mid week. No line was over five minutes.",Brad A
30,A great park in need of some upkeep,"I enjoyed a fun day with my 3 year old grand daughter, her dad (my son) and her uncle (also my son). The children's area if good except that they need more employees. They had half of the rides shut down even though it was the day before Thanksgiving and thus quite busy. The park has a feeling of needing upkeep. They just don't spend time on clean up. It is hard to find a table that is clean when you want to eat. They have rides that my sons really enjoyed. I went on Scream...yes...I did SCREAM!!! It's a great place for a grandma to take her little one for a day of fun. However, the bigger rides are really just for the adventurous/younger crowd.",CMac511
50,Roller Coaster Heaven,"Everything for the novice to the pro! Hang on folks! Don't miss one turn, dip, or even a drop! The kid's area is a great way to begin the roller coaster life for the little ones. Even the experienced thrill seeker will be amazed!",jrkoczman
40,"Had a great time, just a couple of weird things.","First, I've been to Magic Mountain one other time and had such a good time I was afraid I would be disappointed during this return trip with my daughter. I was not disappointed, and in fact, had an even better time this go round.My daughter and I both bought the Platinum Flash Pass and it made the day AMAZING. We never waited in line and rode as much (more?) than we wanted to. The only downside of the flash pass is that they leave it up to you to tell the next rider if you're going to ride a second time (one of the additional benefits of the platinum pass). This resulted in a few dirty looks and a very sad young lady who broke my heart when she blinked her disappointment at me (don't worry, she got to ride that round, I'm not cruel). After that experience my daughter and I agreed that we wouldn't take advantage of the ride-twice benefit.The park was very busy but not well staffed. This may have been because we were there in mid-November and they didn't expect it to be busy. The food lines were very long (no flash pass for that!) and we never did manage to get funnel cake. That line was so long that we would have easily spent two hours waiting.The only other complaint I had is that the park was VERY dark at night. They were clearly decorating for Christmas, but didn't have the holiday lights on yet and much of the ambient lighting was off. It made the park feel a little creepy in some areas.These little complaints did not overshadow our fun. The roller coasters are not to be missed, the park was clean, and we had a great time. I'd go back in a heartbeat.",TuniAz

50,"A blast, as always","It's been years, but I just took my two adult daughters back to MM. Goliath is my favorite and it didn't disappoint. I would avoid the Green Lantern on any future trips as that was just not my type of ride. The Full Throttle was the last ride of the day for us and it was fun. 0-superfast in half a second. Pretty cool. Goliath is still the best, though :)",chicachiquita

50,Green Lantern is a must!,when visiting California we knew this was a must! we booked our tickets in advance online for a price that ended up being completely worth it. we arrived earlyish in the day as we knew it would be busy! the queues were long for most of the rides but none the less every little bit worth it! the shops and places to eat were a little (extremely) over priced and expensive but we indulged in them none the less. Full Throttle was ridiculously amazing and would've been happy to just do it over and over again after the rush of adrenaline you feel. would recommend it alone with the green lantern rollercoaster in the marvel themed section of the park (really cool!). overall an amazingly satisfying experience to an awesome theme park!! would love to return!,kristybate

50,Magic Mountain,My family and I spent the day at the park. It was not crowded so we were able to go on many rides.The bar-b-q tri-tip is great and the holiday decorations made the park seasonally festive.,Mark M
40,Great variety of roller coasters!,We did go off season so we weren't surprised to see a lot of shops and stands weren't open. There were no crowds to speak of and the ride lines moved nicely. My roller coaster loving kids had a good time. The variety of coasters was impressive. They were very disappointed that the best coaster was broken down all day so they never even had a chance to ride it. A couple other good rides were also closed. No explanations for those closures and no one was working on them either.,Marshall711
50,Great for roller coasters!,"We visited the park in October on a Saturday and Sunday and had a blast. Our kids are all boys ages 9,12 and 15. Crowds were minimal and wait times were usually under 15 minutes. The roller coasters are the thing here. They are really amazing and the technology has made them much more fun in the last decade or so. To compare, you can ride the Revolution which was a top coaster in the late 70's and one of the first with a loop. The ride is very bumpy and uncomfortable compared to a new Coaster like Tatsu or even Goliath. The value of the entertainment for the dollar cant be beat, especially compared to the ridiculous prices that Disney now charges.",gregk111
50,Best theme park if you're a coaster fan!,"I went in May and we pretty much had the park to ourselves. For a roller coaster junkie like myself, the place was a dream. Highly recommended! All rides were open except one. Would definitely go back!",Siobhan D
10,Rides were closed,We just left Six Flags. Rights were closed. Two out of three water rides were closed. Couple of the big roller coasters were closed. The kiosks were closed. A lot of the restaurants were closed. Very very disappointing. I would save my money and go to Universal Studios and Disney sea world Legoland anywhere but here. Will never return.,TimChicago_IL
50,Roller coaster/Thrill ride heavy park,"I'm a roller coaster junkie. There are so many coasters at Magic Mountain you might not be able to get through them all in the same day. Don't waste time standing in line, if something looks like a long wait walk to the next one, there's plenty to do. Choose just 1 or 2 that you will devote a lot of time to and just enjoy the rest of the day. Not a lot of flat rides. Food selection is decent but predictably pricey. I have a wheat allergy and I have a vegan friend. We have no problem finding food options, especially at Eatwell across from Gold Rusher. the best coasters are X2, Goliath, Apocalypse, Full throttle, and a lot of people like Tatsu (personally I find it tame and would rather hit one of the other classic rides in the park). There's a kids area that looks decent but I have zero experience in that department. There's almost no flat rides. The membership is definitely worthwhile - wait until Labor Day or X-mas (late in the season or during the off-season) to buy any membership/season pass. They run deals around that time. the Wed before Thanksgiving there's a food drive every year in which you can get in the park by giving them a grocery bag filled with non-perishables.",Katan K

It was a blast, the roller coasters are some of the best in the world.Perfect for thrill seekers who also want a little variety.I recommend that you arrive right when the park opens and race to the back and work your way to the front. The lines for the rides are longest in the early afternoon.",ellentreanor
40,Buy a Gold flash pass,"Loved the park and it's rides, managed to do 8 rides considering we came in at lunch and left at 7pm. The par is open from 10am to 1am! Do buy the Gold flash pass, with a kid on tow it was just enough time to walk at a leisurely pace to the next booked thrill ride. There is a Platinum pass but that was a bit more pricier - maybe we'll get that next time. BTW do not be disappointed if you only got to ride 8 of their most thrilling roller coasters, you'll be feeling a bit mashed by the 8th anyways. There park is huge, be prepared for lots of walking but it's not so bad.",MaryAntonette

20,Beast but too many people,"Only open on the weekends at the moment. This would be the premiere park to visit for thrill rides except there were literally more than 10,000 young students from some association attending in bus load after bus load.At least they could have advertised this on their website, giving us a chance to go somewhere else or come on a different day. We waited in lines for 1 and a half hours for each ride. We got on 5 rides in 8 hours. So basically forget about the 16 rides they advertise, you'll need to choose 5 or 6 max.Another problem with their website is they advertised closing time as 6pm, and they closed at 8 pm instead. Unfortunately we organized our ride home at 6pm as you would. We could have got one more ride in if we knew this.We also saw some with front of the que tickets, something that was not immediately obvious on their website. This is definitely the option to take and now knowing what we do, would be prepared to pay a high price for such tickets.One other complaint is the exorbitant food prices. For people having to stand around all day, surely a little more reasonableness could be applied here.So to sum up our experience after coming such a long way for this place - amazing rides ruined by poor website and information, poor organization and short sighted management, 20 minutes of actual riding in an 8 hour period and rip off food options.We give it two stars, which could easily have been 5. Better management could make this an international icon of a park, and still making plenty of profit. Good management is very hard to find these days.",Bobbies_trippin
50,One day of full thrill!,"I am 42 years-old and I love roller coasters. Six Flags is by far the park that I've ever been with more options of roller coasters. If you go there and you are a roller coaster lover like me, please buy a flash pass and don't miss Full Throttle, Lex Luthor (Drop of Doom), Goliath, Green Lantern and Batman the ride. You will love them!",madridneto
50,Rollercoaster Heaven!!!!,"Visited Six Flags from Perth Australia - and wow we're we impressed! So many different rollercoasters to choose from... they go up and down, side to side, backwards, drop, upside-down... everything you could imagine! Goliath was definitely the most scary! If you love thrill riders, this place is a must go! Not for the faint hearted!",Kayla_maree92
10,I SPENT THE DAY QUEUEING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Bought tickets and parking in advance. Bought tickets in advance to save money. Bought parking in advance to save having to queue up. There is no benefit to buying parking in advance as you still have to queue. Disabled parking could be nearer. Okay there is a shuttle but once at the entrance there is yet more queueing, then through the metal detectors there is even more queueing. Once inside the park you have to queue for EVERYTHING. I arrived at eleven and left at 4pm and with queueing managed to get on two rides so it cost $24.50 per ride which is appalling value. Bathrooms are stinking and there is not enough of them. If you like to queue then Magic Mountain is for you. I would never go again and if my friends ask me I will tell them the truth, it is VERY VERY poor value.",JBrabusLimes
50,Love Rollercoasters? This place is for you!!!,"If you are looking for an amusement park with a lot of rides--most of them high energy, adrenaline rushing rollercoasters--this is where you should spend a day. Nothing but thrills! Upside down, loopdy-loops, high falls and riding on your back!!! Yes! If you love this stuff, do not miss riding the Tatsu! Once you sit in the ride, the seats rotate so that you are on your stomach--this ride is a scary two minutes!!! Awesome park, great rides.The only negative is the same thing that most Six Flags parks (I've been to) suffer from--no centralized food court. The parks were added onto a little at a time, so the food options are scattered about. But, not ""negative"" enough to change my rating from an Excellent!Enjoy!",SJackson50
50,Scarry and exciting,"I was afraid of roller-coasters , but as more and more ride I got, the more I felt unleashed and crazy. The best theme park ever visited !",Petitboy89
40,Massive selection of rides!,There is a massive selection of rides although if you are not fond of big rides there is not a much in-between other than the 'kids' section.We visited in November and it was still busy but still managed to get on all we wanted. I imagine in the peak season I think the fast pass would be the only option if wanted to get on all the rides.Food is very expensive and are not allowed to take anything in with you other than water.,NiallGKelly
50,BEST SIX FLAGS PERIOD,"Six flags magic mountain is the best six flags in the us. If your seeking high adrenaline thrills and the best roller coasters, U can't miss MM. The variety in the coasters is what sets it apart. From the classic batman( seated leg dangling), to riddlers revenge (standing up), to tatsu ( laying down). You must ride all the steel coasters, I'm not a big fan of wooden ones. Id like to keep my teeth lol. But like any theme park come prepared and eat before. The day we went my wife had he mind set on a corn dog thinking they would be like the ones at the fair. Nope. U couldn't even tell that it was a corn dog it was so burned, had them recook to no avail. But the rides made up for it by far. And almost forgot...like anywhere in Cali... $20 parking",Stewarts3125
50,Looking for a fun way to escape the humdrum,"Hang on to your hats.. this is a great way for the family to escape the daily grind and humdrum... full of fun, thrills and excitement. Every ride is not for everybody but there is something for everyone to enjoy and let your day be full of memories. So enjoy and forget about everything else, just for today, with your family and friend, or just being a couple. It's worth it. You will leave with a bunch of awesome memories.",Tom G
50,5 Stars for 6 Flags,"Six Flags has turned it around and made this park a fun, safe and downright enjoyable family experience.

50,12 hours of fun!,"We had a great day! So many great rides, we were here in October so got to experience fright night as well! Mazes were creepy and scary! Characters jumping out from every direction - great day & night. Stayed from open till close, look into the VIP passes we didnt realise that the main 2 rides weren't included in them... unless its a really busy day probably not worth the extra $$.",bekky_lee

30,"Big Rides, Big Lines.","We came during the weekend because it's usually closed during weekdays.They didn't accept out coupon apps coupon, said we had to print it out.The rides are GOOD, a couple had be screaming and I don't normally easily. However, the lines where like 1 hour or more wait for some of the big rides. A bunch where closed and stuff wasn't working, disappointed that they where like that. Also the weren't many toilets around either.",KINGKIDDO
40,"Awesome rides, but room for improvement","I always go to this amazing park every year when I come to visit my friends in Huntington Beach. It has awesome roller coaster rides. X2, Tatsu, Full Throttle and Goliath are among my favorites. I love Lex Luthor: Drop of Doom too. This place is a thrill-seekers dream come true. However, I can only rate this park four stars because there is room for improvement. First I would say get everything running the way it should be. There's no reason for a one train only operation on any of the coasters, unless there is a day where there literally is only one or two people at the park. Next I would say make sure all the extras on some rides; such as the audio on X2 is working all the time. Sometimes I would come off that ride disappointed that it was inoperable. That needs to be fixed.Next, I wouldn't mind if they didn't add a new coaster for a couple of years and focused instead on getting more in-between rides; particularly a new water ride, so there's something for everyone throughout the park. Magic Mountain lost a good log ride. Don't get me wrong, I love Full Throttle and wouldn't trade it for anything, but I do miss the Log Jammer. They need to find a spot for some other flume ride so there's more of an option for water rides again.Next, a good line up of new flat rides would be a welcome addition. Magic Mountain has lost so many over the years. In fact, it was a sad day for me when the Spin Out was removed. This was probably my favorite flat ride they had, as it was very much like a favorite carnival ride of mine called the Gravitron. I remember spinning in that thing until I was woozy. I think bringing back some old classics like Tilt-A-Whirl, or Enterprise, and then adding like a Huss Frisbee would be quite welcome here.I also think adding a relaxing ride for people of all ages like a big ferris wheel would be a nice touch.Lastly, I'd try to work on the theming and make sure the rides fit the theme of each area. DC Universe was a good start, but the theming is still weak in other areas. For example, the Panda Express seems out of place in Baja Ridge, as does Superman in Samurai Summit. I also agree with whoever said that some rides should incorporate single rider lines. Lex Luthor actually does, and Deja Vu used to when they had it. But it can easily be utilized on many other coasters.Other than this list of improvements that can be made, I think this is a great park. I would give it five stars if they would just make these needed improvements, and as far as running it goes, do it right. I can't wait to give Twisted Colossus a try. Some people have reported thinking it's blasphemy to give a classic woodie an extreme makeover, but hey! I think it's going to be awesome.",Mike F
50,Six Flags Homeschool Day,"Went to Magic Mountain on homeschool day, which they do every November. I love it because the lines are almost non-existent and it's not very crowded so I can have a great experience with my friends. The park is great, the staff is friendly, and the rides are exciting.",194pistols
40,"Rides, rides, rides!","If you love rides, this is the place! They have a small section of the park with rides for young children. I was there in October, and they did trick or treating for the kids.The park, however, is great for teens! The majority of the rides are geared for teens and young adults.and there are a LOT of rides! They have the biggest and best rides. Then there is entertainment at night. Definitely, a fun day if you like rides.",Roverette

40,Great rides,I have been a season pass holder for several years. Some of the rides are too intense for younger children. They do have a very good kiddie section of the park for the little ones. The rides are catered to either the 6 and under crowd or 12 and older crowd. Security has improved and for the most part it is pretty clean. The demographic still is targeted toward teenagers which leads to some bad behavior and a lot of foul language that may not be appropriate for tweens. Rides can be pretty intense and it is a NIGHTMARE to walk!,David S

I got soaking wet at a rafting coaster, would have liked some warning before that. But I guess if you gonna go rafting you gonna get wet. It was a fun day with friends. The lines were not too long. DIdn't have to wait more than 30 mins. We opted out off the flash pass. It was a good decision. You need to take some time between coasters. We tried pretty much all the coasters in 5 to 6 hours there.",Mohammad S
40,"Great thrill rides, with no single rider lines.","I had not been to Magic Mountain since my teens,so over 20 years ago. Took advantage of their Labor Day sale and got a season pass including Admission to all Six Flags parks and also Hirricaine Harbor and free parking until end of 2015. I love roller coasters and this is the place to ride them. They have a great selection from old classics like ""Revolution"" to newer coasters which are so awesome to ride. There is a good kids area with kids sized coasters for the little ones and my Son had a great time at Bugs Bunny world. The thrill rides are where Magic Mountain shines. They are constantly updating the park with new coaster. They have begun construction on the ""Dueling Colossus"" and that should be an awesome ride when it opens. I guess my main complaint is that on some of the coasters they run one car and that makes the wait much longer for each guest. I would see plenty of people walk the other way when they see a longer than normal wait time. Some rides had very short or no line. Another complaint would be that when I go alone, I don't see the ride operators ask if there are any single riders. I saw enough empty seats to make me wonder why they don't ask. I don't care if I ride with a stranger as long as I can get on the ride quicker. Maybe MM can start up single rider lines, just a suggestion. Overall enjoyable experience at an affordable price.",thematrix

30,Too Many People!!!,"We actually picked to go in October, because of the Halloween Spook House and less tourists. To our dismay it was packed, loads of people everywhere. We went years ago and it wasn't like this, there was one spook house and the line wasn't too bad, but now they have several spook houses and you have to pay another fee (wasn't included in your price of ticket). They also have another fee for the fast pass. We will not be going back here again!",Tammy C
40,Great for the season pass holder!,"Having a season pass keeps going to Magic Mountain fun. We dont have to pay for parking, kids can bring friends and we go when its not busy.

40,Off Season - No Queues :-),"Arrived at park opening, 1030hrs on Halloween. Only a couple of rides had queues of about 30-45 mins (Tatsu and Apocolypse). All other rides had zero wait. Just walk straight on. Plenty empty seats on some coasters. Had a great time and by mid afternoon was all coastered out. A couple of the main rides were not operational but there was enough to keep me happy. Yes food and drink were expensive but you come to expext it at these places. And don't go expecting a Disney park. This a white knuckle max thrill seekers park. $20 to park car was somewhat excessive. Can imagine crowds and queues would be horrendous at peak times, so I personally would not go near the place then. Had a great day (currently lying in bed hoping to settle my stomach soon).",MidgieMan
50,Coaster Lover,If your a thrill seeker and love a good coaster I recommend going to Magic Mountain. A season pass is the way to go if you live close. I have definitely gotten my money's worth out of mine and will be purchasing a 2015 pass. With the pass you can stay the whole day or just run in for a quick coaster or two. I love the Mountain!!!!!!

Six flags doesn't feel / look polished or maintained. The rides are great.... thrilling beyond anything i have ever ridden before. Didn't really fear for my life or anything (from a safety point of view). The flash pass is essential in this park. Very helpful to skip the long lines.A fresh face-lift / renovation would really bring up the level of the park. and the bathrooms need cleaning round the clock. Otherwise, from a fun factor: Super Fun.",AhmedElGamal

40,Roller coaster dream come true...,"The best park for thrill roller coasters for me, even though I got sick from riding too many of them. Literally got sick on my first visit, but I'd love to come back there again and visit other Six Flags.Not a recommended place for young children, although there are some attractions that suits young children. Thrill seeker young children are welcome.The best of them are Tatsu, a must ride of them all... then X2, Green Lantern just a couple more to name.The fright night was also good, they really know how to dress up, camouflage and scare people.I would appreciate if the park can improve the queue efficiency by allowing more single riders, it would better speed up the queue by eliminating the empty single seats. It was frustrating to see empty seats while waiting in a line, regardless short or long. I would've rated excellent if there's more single rider availability.",AntGan
50,Four eyes,"This is an amazeballs amusement park with fantastic and presumably scary rides.

30,Great for the teenagers,"We went to Six Flags early Sept 2014 with 2 adults and 4 kids (aged 3, 9, 13 & 15). We didnt see the 13 and 15 year old until we were about to leave and they loved it - best ride park ever for them. The nine year old didnt meet a small amount of the height restrictions and the 3 year old had a very limited amount of rides she could go on. The park wasnt overly busy but the ride wait times were still relatively long. In hind sight i should have got the teenagers a fast pass and they would have got to go on more than 10 rides for the day. Personally i found it a little difficult to navigate around and it seemed to take me forever to get anywhere with the 3 year old and i didnt think it was very well sign posted. This is only compared to the other parks. I didnt go on any rides and was the chaperone for the 3 year old. Overall an enjoyable day but long and a lot of walking. I must say i do love the refillable drink cups but being off season not all refill stations are open and on a hot day it can be a long time between drinks.",Nat E
30,Long Lines,Took us 2 hours each rides in line. The most frustrating was the staff on the batman rides were playing around eventhough lines was soooo long.. i understand if they are focusing on checking the safety but nope... over all we just ended up riding 3 the whole day.,Chinnita_M

50,The ultimate destination for roller coaster addicts,"If you love roller coasters, real roller coasters, you must go visit Six Flags Magic Mountain. While most parks have one or two high adrenaline rides and many others catering to the more faint of heart, this one does not compromise but is jam packed with attractions catering to the wet dreams of adrenaline seekers with much fewer alternatives for the less brave.Admission is relatively inexpensive compared to other US amusement parks. Book your tickets online to save a hefty USD 20 vs the on site price. You won't be allowed to bring outside food and drinks and prices in the park are steep (4.15 for a bottle of water, 10.00 for a ""pizza combo"", which is essentially one slice of pizza and two cheese bread sticks without any drinks). As you will be allowed to leave and re-enter the park, outside eating might be an option if you're on a budget.There are plenty of attractions in the park. We went on an off peak day with relatively short lines for most rides (except Superman and X2) but were still not able to ride all attractions. Of all the coasters, we liked X2 and Tatsu the most. X2 is probably the most intense coaster anywhere and a must do. You can safely discard Ninja which is downright boring. Also the green lantern ride looks way more interesting than it feels. The Batman coaster felt very similar to X2 except for the 360° rotating seats, so you could skip that one, too.Park management is giving waiting time estimates, which almost always were too low. We were lucky to be visiting on an off-peak day, so waiting times were mostly still OK. During high season and on weekends, buy one of the very expensive fast-passes if you can afford it.On most rides, you will not be allowed to take bags or water bottles with you. That is OK but what we found really annoying is that on some of them, you are not even allowed to place these items on the nearby shelves or floors but are obliged to pay extra for a locker. I really had to hold on to myself and swallow my fury when they threw away the $4 water bottle I had just bought.Despite these minor nuisances, Six Flags Magic Mountain is an experience I can only highly recommend.",SandmannX
50,Adrenalin to the max,This is my favorite park in the entire USA there's roller coasters for days every ride leaves you wanting more and when is time to go home make a pit stop at the funnel cake place they are off the hook my favorite is the funnel cake with Oreo cookie ice creamMUY BUENO!!!!!!,Jorge V

40,Awesome roller coasters,"I just had a fantastic day at Six Flags Magic Mountain. I visited on a Friday in October which was awesome as the lines were very short during the day and at night I got to experience Freight Fest. Even with the short lines and being in the park for 9 hours I didn't have time to go on all the rides as I also spent time enjoying the atmosphere of the park.The highlights of the day:- the X2, it was unreal, the scariest and most intense roller coaster I've been on.- all the zombies, monsters and creatures walking around the park after dark. Costumes and make up were fantastic and they interaction with guests was great.Tips:- The Viper and the Gold Rusher seemed a little outdated and were a bit too rough on your body and probably best avoided.- Wear clothes with zip pockets or a money belt to hold your money and phone/camera. Some of the roller coaster you must not have any loose articles on you and they can't be left on the platform either.- Most of the food in the park seemed to be sold as a combo meal but I asked for just the burger and tap water and it was a little cheaper than getting the meal.- Wear good shoes, you are doing a lot of walking in the park and there are a lot of hills.- Bring a sandwich bag for your phone and money, some rides involved water and you do get pretty wet.I had a great day and wish I had the time to return for another day. The only thing that's stopping me from giving this park 5 stars is that there are some improvements the park could make, namely that not all rides had wait times posted, rider optimisation was performed (eg, at Superman there was no one ensuring that riders were getting into the required groups of 4 so the ride was not running at full capacity when there was a long wait) and I found it difficult to find some of the rides or the entries for some of the rides.My recommendation is if you like roller coasters then just go for it but try and go off peak if you can. If you don't like thrill rides or have little kids I'd give this place a miss.",Babybird
30,"Great Rides, LONG lines, poor facilities","Magic Mountain has some amazing roller coasters! Absolutely loved them...however, unless you are willing to shell out another $100 a ticket for a fast pass you will be in line from 1-2 hours per ride. There are no benches to rest on and some rides have employees telling people to get off the railings...seriously? We've been in line for an hour resting on a rail is not that big of a deal. However, they did NOTHING about the line jumpers. ""Oh I have family up ahead""...too bad! No one was watching for them at all and it got old fast.The food is WAY too expensive, even for an amusement park. Disney is cheaper...that says something. And its not very good.If you are a woman you will be in line again for 30-45 minutes waiting for a nasty, disgusting restroom with no toilet paper nor paper towels. It was so bad women were just going to the mens room. Unacceptable.I would have given them a 4 instead of 3 if it weren't for the bathrooms and food. While I wasn't thrilled with the lines they were expected.",medako

10,Knew better than to come back,"The positive... Tickets are reasonable, rides are amazing.The rest of it.... Parking is $20.00. The park is way overcrowded, you even had to wait in line to use the bathroom every time. The ride lines are an easy 1-3 hour wait. In an entire day my family got on 3 rides and that was hustling.They were only running one train on several of the coasters even though one of the employees mentioned they were expecting very high attendance. Good luck finding an employee if you have a question or concern as there are none at the entrance or exit of each ride, only at the loading area. Two members of your party waited on line for Superman only to get to the front of the line and have the ride break down. They waited two hours and had to use the restroom. They were told that the staff did not know when the attraction would reopen but if they left the line they would need to wait all over again. Unacceptable after 2 hours. They never did get to ride it. We waited in line for the river raft ride with our group only to come to a staircase after 30 minutes of waiting. This was a problem because one of our party was in a wheel chair. This attraction is not equipped for handicapped in any way (stairs at entrance and exit) so they could not ride at all. Had there been a staff member at the front we would have known. In addition the park is not clean at all, trash everywhere and gum stuck to everything.This is not a place for family's to enjoy.",travelerAZ2
50,This Is Not Your Six Flags from the 1990's,"Six Flags is really upgrading their park experience! From cleanliness to guest interactions, they are cranking up the fun notch!!There appears to be a stronger presence of security to cool the jets of those who are more about disrupting the experience of other park patrons. In addition, the lines appear to go faster - and the rides don't break down like they used to.Best tip? Go in the early evening or later!! Seems there are a LOT of folk who feel that it's important to get there at the crack of dawn - That is cool for family types - but if your party is over the age of 18, I would STRONGLY recommend the evening/nighttime experience!! Those rides take on a whole new dimension at night!!",NaughtyNorris
50,Amazing park for those thrill seekers.,Sic Flags is the place to go when you're feeling adventurous. You want thrils they have thrills. Get lots of rest and come early to fully enjoy this park. One thing I'd recommend is bring a backpack full of water bottles. Keeps you energized and hydrated throughout the day. You will need it for screams your lungs out on the massive roller coasters they have.,Anthony H
50,awesome!,Six Flags has definitely gotten a lot better sober years ago. The place is well-kept and the employees look like they enjoy their jobs. The rides are so much fun! I only wish I lived closer so I can come more often!,Leigha D
50,Awesomeness! !!!!!!!,"I have been coming here since I was a kid, and as advertised. .....the thrill capital of the world!!!!! (In reference to amusement park thrill rides).I have been to other 6 flags parks, and none of them are quite on the same level!I did go on friday October 18th.During the day, the lines were short!For these type of days, take friday off work, and lap the park, during the day, then the Mazes at night!About 6 pm the lines got longer, as expected!Walked into superman at dusk, and getting out of there, I was VERY IMPRESSED, w the amount of monster's through the park, and mazes!!!Definitely cost is MUCH MUCH LESS than Universal Studios, and Knotts Scary Farm!!!",oneeddy1
40,Fright Night,"Awesome effects and costumes. We went on a Saturday night, I have been to Six Flags probably 20+ times and I have never seen it this busy before. If you are going to ride a ride don't go during fright fest. If you want to do the mazes get the VIP Maze pass. I kicked down for the extra this time. Got through all the mazes (8 of them) twice in a little more than three hours. In the regular Maze line people were waiting 2-3 hours for the better mazes. My favorite is Vault 666, but the wife liked Red's Revenge and Willoby's mansion better. The 3D toys Maze was pretty awesome visually. Personally none of them are that scary but there are a lot of startles. I enjoy listening to/watching the screaming panicked teenagers.",kryptoknightxxx
50,Must Visit,"This was the main purpose of our trip from Utah. The Season Pass (especially with the payment option) is a great deal. I HIGHLY suggest going on any day but Saturday.The ""Fright Fest"" is fun, the actors scaring the girls is rather entertaining.For your ""Must Experience"" list, everyone needs to ride FULL THROTTLE and TATSU!!!",Shellimark
50,awesome day had a blast,Got on almost all the ride would have if I didn't have to leav early. Will most like be back in the next two weeks.,Jacob M
50,Amazing!,"Love this park, so much to do so little time to do it in!!! I recommend going for at least two days to get the full experience. This park is packed full of great coasters and it never gets old!!!!Fright Fest was amazing too! so much fun!!!!!!",insane_much
30,"Good for Thrill Seekers, HORRIBLE for young kids","As a thrill seeker I loved the parks rides ( X2, Tatsu, Superman ) but I feel as if there isn't enough for families to together. Six Flags puts all of their money towards thrill rides and leaves the non thrill seekers behind. Six Flags markets the park as great for ""family fun"" but their definition of it is a few kids rides, a couple family coasters, and lots of rides for thrill seekers. If the park put money towards rides for everyone rather than the latest and greatest "" record breaking coaster "" it would instantly become one of my favorites.",Coasterlover62
50,Amazing roller coasters - flash pass worth it,"Went here on a Saturday in September 2014Pre-booked parking, admission tickets and platinum flash pass.......... IMO we'll worth it as this was a one off visit for us and time was precious on our jam-packed holiday.We went to X2 as the gates opened as wasn't included in the flash pass - we got on inside of 5mins!Then picked up our flash pass and it was truly worth it. Some queues were 90mins long and the most we waited was 10mins.The coasters are unbelievable..... Nothing in England even comes close!Food is expensive and not great but we didn't go there for the food :-/I'd go again and I would recommend the flash pass if going on a Saturday",paul_woodchurch
50,a paradise for people who seek adrenaline & thrillers,"spent a full day with the family in this huge and exiting park.guess since it was a of season Friday we didn't suffer from long lines.the rides are unbelievable and the variety is big.don't miss the batman , GREEN LANTERN,Goliath , superman and LEX LUTHOR...AND OF COURSE THE X2.there is also plenty of things for young kids in a dedicated area so if you are visiting with a few kids of different ages you may consider a split.",WWWCoyote
50,Awsum park!!!,Went to six flags and had an awsum day!!Expected it to be busy as it was Columbus Day but lines were very short apart from Superman which was the only long wait all day.Park very clean and staff very helpful and friendly.As coaster fanatics this park rivals busch gardens tampa for the best rides.,JOANNE_M186460
50,Fright Fest,Excellent place to let loose and have fun! My overall experience at Six Flags was awesome and can't wait to visit again!,Jasmine Z
30,"Fun, long waits, but w/alcohol?","We went with a large group of kids and had fun. It was Fright Night - a special Halloween event that starts at 7:00. Be aware, it will scare young kids and people like my wife! Lol. The place is really dark for this event, lots of fog - pretty cool.Know, it is not like Disneyland. Lots of locals who were friendly, but a lot of people drinking. We had no problems and they had a lot of security. The good news is they are strict, but I saw some intoxicated people. Again, we had probably 35-40 kids and not a single issue we heard of - good job Magic Mountain. We had discount tickets, and I think anyone can find a deal if they look.These are some of the craziest rides in the country - caveat emptor - buyer beware. The rides are rough (Green Lantern - I'm surprised they don't get a lawsuit a day). We did have people lose items on rides including an iPhone 6 on X2. Secure your stuff and take glasses off. I would have lost mine for sure on the Green Lantern! Have fun - this is for young adults and teenagers.Would have rated higher if not for the length of waits and number of times the rides shutdown (better safe than sorry I guess).",J S
40,Great if you love big roller costers,"We went on a week day to Six Flags and there were hardly any queues which was fantastic. If you love big roller coasters this is the place for you, as pretty much the whole park is full of fast large roller-coasters all offering something different.The only main downside is the cost. It is not cheap to get in and you have to pay $15 or $20 parking per car. You are also not allowed to take in food and drink into the Park, and inside this isn't cheap to buy, but like many theme parks this is what they do. If you are going to go to 2 or more Six Flag theme parks it is probably worth looking at the Season pass option as it is the equivalent to two visits.However overall the park is worth going to and is only about a 40 minute drive from LA. Also if you want to get away from the hustle and bustle of LA check out Valencia/Santa Clarita as they are nice and lots of places to eat etc.",Carley99_uk
10,"Don't go-the ""talent"" is crazy and security is blind","A ""talent"" at this park made up that I hit her. I did not touch her. Security threw me out and wouldn't even listen to me. It was crazy! This place is full of people on ego trips that just want to make your life miserable. They can get away with it so they do it. DO NOT GO HERE!!!",H0rrible1
10,Awful. Just awful,"I like roller coasters and i like theme parks but my wife and i hated this place.Went on a Thursday that was predicted to be quiet. Entry tickets aren't cheap but you really need a flash pass and then, if you want it to work on the popular rides you have to pay an extra $15 per person per ride. Then and extra $18 for a locker, extortionate food.What really infuriated me was the constant line cutters. Staff didn't care. There were signs up saying expected wait 40 mins - ended up being 2hour 15.In all honestly, i didn't really enjoy x2 or the dragon one. Very short. Quite extreme and made me feel sick.Not as sick as my wallet!!",Shamalam_1
50,Amazing place - best park in la -and fright night a bonus,"We got there at 10 am ' gates opened at 1030 and we left at 115am the next day. This place is awesome a massive collection of different rollercoasters and rides. Add into that fright night with roving scarers and the mazes and it's super entertainment coming from Aus.Do this last of the big parks in LA as the thrills and speed are higher than Anywhere else and you'll need to be park fit as the site is massive to walk around.We were here 3/10 and it was really hot. You need a lot of water. We got the free Multi fill cups and shared within the family, food is relatively expensive so eat down near green lantern ride where there is good variety .Due to the park size plan your trip around it to minimize back tracking and hill climbs..eg do tasty then ninja,X2 is most popular ride and we went straight there which wasted an hour queuing . By 10 pm we were able to just walk up so I suggest going anti clockwise around the park.If pressed for time skip ninja but all other coasters are great and have own unique thrills.We took the flash pass (basic one) and really only needed it on superman, be careful as it's not valid on the 4 main rides. We got told at end of the day that although 6 flags doesn't have single rider queue line if you go in the exit sometimes hey will let you on to fill the ride . We were there when usa schools already back so I assume flash past has benefits outside this quiet period, eg even on our day the flash pass saved 20 minutes on the superman ride and got us on the ride in 5 mins.Fright night excellent and worthy the 20 for the mazes.. It's not for kids under say 12 unless they can put up with. Good scare.For our family 6 flags was he pinnacle and I suggest you go Disneyland, then universal then 6 flags as otherwise the kids will be real bored I Disneyland, as Aussies you will not get anything like this back home and the price and number if rides you get is great value, we did 3 rides in a row on viper at one stage and would've had over 20 rides in the day.Also we stayed at the garden inn hilton nearby which was a winner as they have a great shuttle service, good advice on rides and it allowed us to send my wife and 2 little ones home at 8 and me and teenagers return after closing. Don't try to drive up there between 4 and 7 pm.Also beware if your youngest is under 48 inches they won't have a lot to ride, and on most rides they offer child swaps ( eg let the other parent hold spot in queue and swap child over). Plus you can I quiet times leave some of your stuff on the unloading side of the ride but at busy times this may be hard so limit what you bring, take a $8 Multi hire locker and wear good cargo pants with zip or good buttoned pockets so you can keep wallet and phone on you.",big_family_4_kids
50,Life is complete!,"Had such a amazing time here, picked the right time of the year to go (wednesday in middle of may) so there were pretty much no ques for any rides! So much that I almost got sick of rollercoasters as we would just stay on and ride again and again. There are also so many amazing rides! Being from New Zealand it is great to finally see a real theme park haha. Also season passes are pretty good value.",jamesbK7640QV
50,Exhilarating!,"Go for the speed and the thrill. Coasters to take your breath away. Place is humming in the heat! Wear comfy shoes and be prepared to get wet on the rapids. Buy the drink canister special.Favourite rides: Apocalypse, Green Lantern and Full Throttle.",Jenny B
50,Great for winter,"Went there on a rainy Sunday in January, got to ride all of the ""extreme"" roller coaster rides within that same day. So, it turned out to be pretty good value for money. THIS PARK IS A NIGHTMARE DURING THE SUMMER, so don't go unless you're ok with paying for a day pass to luckily get on 2 or 3 of the good rides. Everything seemed pretty disorganized. As an example, I got to ride on the front row of Tatsu after pushing out people ahead of me when it was clear that there was a free single seat in the front row, and I was a single rider.Overall great rides, but stick to the winter weekends, even better if it's cloudy or rainy. Otherwise the crowd will ruin your day.",Ezequiel G
50,fun for everyone,Six flags was a great place to have fun and enjoy myself in many ways with alot of rides for everyone in the fam. And alot of entertaiment specially during fright fest i had a great expirience and im sure anyone who goes to sixflags will have a great time too.,candylover1199
50,Annual pass--good investment,Magic Mountain has streamlined the activation process for the annual pass. No more killing two hours just to get the pass activated at the park. They are updating the rides all the time. Great experience for the thrill seeker as well as young children.,Joanna1776
50,Great roller coasters,"Magic Mountain's roller coasters are insane. Really quick and some real surprises in the twists and turns. Probably the best park I've visited for rides. Food prices were reasonable for this type of park. Drinks and parking were overpriced. If I were a local I'd definitely buy a season pass, these look like great value and can get you free parking.",PaulMack
10,So badly run with arrogant teens in charge.,"First things first - people are smoking weed everywhere in this park, which is an absolute disgrace,as you can barely come in with anything but a water bottle. I have regular DA tests in my line of work and I was pretty angry with the flagrant abuse here that could end up costing me.This is not the best coaster park in the world, don't believe the hype. Parking is $20, um ok Universal in Hollywood charges $10 and you're nowhere. The place is full of arrogant young staff who take their authority to another level and treat you cluelessly or spitefully. We couldn't use a board of California voucher on our phone because it apparently needed to be printed, but the page had a typeable barcode on it. At X2 a member of staff made me throw my bottles away to go on a ride whilst other attendants let others leave theirs down. The queuing process was archaic as ignorant staff deliberately left multiple seats empty when lone or couple riders were available, this doubled waiting times. The communication and management of staff was absolutely SHOCKING - Superman the Ride broke down and staff left 100+ people sweltering for 90 minutes in the 100f heat with absolutely no instruction, in the UK a theme park will announce on a tanoy the ride is closed and give a free fast pass for when it opens, this is bad. When Superman finally reopened the attendant let fast track people who had been there 5 mins in before all those who had waited 90.With all the hype, I expected Alton Towers style rides, only DC world delivered with 3 roller coasters with the proper head restraints all european parks have. The rest had super safe lap bars that led you to being jerked about violently for a few minutes. Lockers were a joke, the big name parks don't charge for them. Unbelievable how rude and untrained the staff were.",bex89
10,We cut our losses and left. Waste of time!,"We came from Australia and met family from Canada to go the theme parks. Loved Disneyland, Universal and Knottsberry Farm.Utterly disappointed with Magic Mountain. It took us an hour just to get through the carpark line which cost us $20.Had to go through medal detectors to get in and throw out all of our food. We had just spent $60 on Subway but was not allowed to take it in. It didn't say No Food on the website when we booked tickets.Wait times said 15 mins but took an hour. Staff loading rides were very slow and empty seats were not filled.No staff manning the lines so people were pushing in and knocked over our 8 year old. No staff around to help.We had 11 people split in two groups. After one ride each, no food and a 40 minute wait just to buy a drink, we decided to leave and ask for a refund due to safety issues and false ride waif times.Waited 40 minutes in line hit customer service. They were rude and unhelpful. They have a No Refund Policy so we ended up cutting our losses of $500+ and wasting half a day and left.My advice -Don't waste your money!!!",Tracy R
40,Amazing Rides!!!!!,We really enjoyed our visit to Magic Mountain.It was a really good day. Everyone was friendly and the rides were fast and felt very safe. We don't live close but will come back when we can.,Tammy620
50,Family Fun,Fun for everyone in our party. Had an excellent time. Bought season passes and made a 2 day trip out of it. Links on the park for great hotel deals nearby made for an easy relaxing weekend.,Cynthia F
40,Local Visitor,"I grew up going to Magic Mountain as a preteen, and it was my first job when I turned 15. It was a great place to work (I was there way too long), but I made some of the best life friends while working there as a teenager and all the way through college and into post graduate school. I worked at a restaurant there and I am thankful for stability and experience the job gave me.I just went back recently with my 6th grade students in June of 2014, and while it was quite different from my childhood and early adult years, it seemed to have grown with the times.I have gotten season passes for my 4 year old daughter and myself so we can go to Bugs Bunny World as we please as it is only a 5 minute drive from our home.I find it convenient that Bugs Bunny World is close to the entrance, which makes a quick trip all that more enjoyable. Recently we visited and the kids were able to Trick or Treat in Bugs World, which was a great bonus to our day.We enjoy it for quick trips, but I feel like some of the older structures should be removed to provide a more updated feel (such as the dilapidated tram station).",laamy24
50,Great park but takes time to do everything!,"We visited here for one day and paid extra for every queue jump pass possible. It was a LOT of extra money but as we were only passing by for one day, we figured we had to do it to experience all the rides.It turned out to be a great decision as despite being at the park all day, we only just managed to get on all the main rides once each. The rides are awesome and well worth a visit but due to the high cost, I would not visit again.",wcel84
50,Thrill capital of the world,"25 roller coasters... more than any other place on Earth...15 of the Top 20 coasters on Earth ....3 of the Top 5 roller coasters on Earth.....They call themselves the Thrill Capital of the World, and by all accounts it is....need I say more?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?This has been my favorite amusement park since I can remember. Although they recently closed one of my favorites, Colossus, once the tallest, fastest, longest, wooden coaster on the planet; they have reinvention plans to make it the tallest, fastest, longest, hybrid coaster on the planet...almost 5 minutes long!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Set to open sometime next year, and as an annual pass holder I CANNOT WAIT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",Fitf00die
50,The best theme park ever but not for young children,"This park is aimed at the serious roller coaster freaks. It has the best coasters we have ever seen and each one offers a totally different experience.We visited with our thirteen year old and I would say he was the right age. I wouldn't recommend the park for families with young children although there are still plenty of rides if you do but it isn't like Disney or Knox.The park was very clean and well kept, the queues were non existent and we managed to walk on to every ride, I am so glad we didn't waste money on a fast pass.We got a yearly pass for $79 which covers September 2014 until December 2015 it was a bargain. Just wish we lived closer.",karos1
50,Fright fest,"Fright Fest was amazing, much more then I expected, perfect. Concert was outstanding. Roller Costers open 'till 01AM.",Rodrigo S
50,Best park in the world!!,"If you like BIG, bad roller coasters, then this is the place for you! This is not your mom and pop park - this is the home of some of the world record breaking coasters. Make sure you are at least 55 inches tall and bring all the courage you got - this place will take your breath away and make you feel like a teen again. When you are ready for some good food and good service, check out the sports bar - great food and ice cold beer. It's a little pricey, but well worth it!!",Traves R
50,How to do Six Flags,"Had a blast on my last visit! Start off with the older coasters first. You can get a lot of rides in with the minimal wait times plus its ju st cool to ride some of the parks first coasters. Revolution came out in '77 and still rollin'!! Work you way to the back of the park by gotham city and scream later in the evening. More people leaving equals less wait time lol! Oh, and if you have a headrest on your ride, USE IT!!!",BigGus32
30,"It's not Disney, but it's fun!","If you like roller coasters, this is your place! :)We bought the flash pass, to make sure we would ride the main attractions of the park... It's very expensive (the platinum costs 100 bucks per person), and I'm not sure it was worthy for me.Two of the main rides are not included in the flash pass (the X2 and the Full Throttle), unless you're willing to add more 15 bucks (per ride and per person) on your flash pass. So, if you have the platinum pass and want to ride these two without the wait time, you'll spend 130 bucks, plus the entrance fee and the parking fee.We got some 2-hour lines in the morning, but at 3 pm, no one was checking our flash passes anymore..... So think twice before buying them.We also got to some rides (not included in the flash pass) that stated a 15 minute wait time, which ended being one hour wait time. Guess they don't update that as often as they should.Don't forget to add to that a 30-40 minute wait in any quick service restaurant to get your lunch. We waited until 3pm to have lunch, and ended up in a 40 minute wait line to grab a couple of hamburgers.....The rides were awesome, don't get me wrong..... it's just too many lines, for everything! When it's sunny and 105F, you get tired really fast.I would go again, certainly, because I'm a roller coaster fan, but I have to gain my patience back, once I've left all of it in that place on September.",Andressa A
50,My favourite!,"Absolutely love magic mountain! So many awesome rides, so much fun. Obviously because of the size of the park and depending on how many people are there you may not get to go on every ride but it's so worth going. I have been 3 times now. If you love rollercoasters then this is the place for you!! Staff are friendly also.",Amy G
30,Reasonable,I actually visited about 10years ago when my nephew and niece were youngerWe all had a great day out and the attractions were okayNothing special but still a good all round day out,Scott E
50,Must visit,When you travel a long way and pay a lot of money it is good to receive good value.This park delivered good value.,Samuel M
20,Could be better.,"If you want a half reasonable experience here, then you need to spend a heck of a lot of money! We went on Sat 13 September. The park was only open on weekends at this time of year, so we were limited by our schedule to go on a Saturday. It was extremely busy and it was an extremely hot day 111 F.So, there was hardly any shade over the queueing areas and the queues were ridiculously long. 2 hours for X2, for example.Great that there were rubbish bins everywhere you looked - including in the queuing areas. REALLY NOT GREAT that the rubbish bins were swarming with (I mean heaps of!!) bees. It is not acceptable to have people queuing in areas swarming with bees. Many people are allergic, so surely this is a safety issue?Since visiting Six Flags, we have visited Disneyland, Universal, and Knotts and none of these parks have had a problem with bees in their rubbish bins. I think Six Flags need to up their cleaning/pesticide regime. If your competition can do it, then you need to too.So, the queues are massive, and the rides are going with empty seats.We sprung for a Gold Fast Pass because we only had one day at the park, it was a Saturday, it was going to be hot, and we are from NZ, so will never go back there.The pass was worth every cent! Except the park dropped the ball later in the day when the Goliath queue was growing and my husband used the pass and still had to wait more than half an hour when the ride was going with empty single seats. I was a non-rider and asked the ride operator why he couldn't jump on and why it was taking so long to get on the ride, even with the fast pass. No real reason. I think they put him in the wrong queue and they didn't have a single rider policy for that ride, so it was perfectly acceptable for it to go with empty seats whilst the queue got longer and longer.I am of the firm belief that Six Flags want you to have the whole miserable queuing experience so that you will buy the fast pass.The rides themselves were good. Husband's favourite ride was Tatsu. X2, Riddler's Revenge, and Goliath were runners up.The park is not very good value at all when you add up the charges for parking the car, the entry fees, the fast pass, the fast pass add-on (we added x2 for $15 to save the 2 hour wait), and the exhorbitant food prices. Total rip-off.Only go if you are totally into coasters. Be prepared to spend a fortune on a fast pass with add-on/s and eat a big breakfast so you don't waste too much money on unhealthy overpriced food.",NZTiberius
40,Excellent rides but park needs a little TLC,"It had been a few years since my last visit but it was very well worth it. X2, Tatsu and Riddler's Revenge were just as I remembered. Green Lantern was fun but a bit too short for my taste. The new Full Throttle definitely ranks up there with X2! On the downside, the park needs to be cleaned up a bit. There were quite a few cracks along the walkways and stairs and a good power wash wouldn't hurt as well. Other than that, it was worth the entrance fee and parking.",TrippingOutInSoCal
30,"Great rides, bad organisation","Some great rides on offer...However a couple of let downs...Car parking $20 on entry, which is not included in your ticket price and don't seem to remember any info on this when we bought tickets on line.Also a lack of staff constituted in inaccurate queuing times being displayed. The sign showed 45 minutes for the rapids, however we spent an hour and half in the queue.We bought the sports drink cup which entitled you to free refills...this doesn't include every establishment at the park and also those that were included had massive queues. Most restaurants/shops were undermanned hence the queuing.Like I said, some really good rises, probably need to be a lot more patient that I was today.",Prw83
40,Tips for Enjoying Six Flags Magic Mountain,"I have been going to Six Flags Magic Mountain on a monthly basis for over a year now. Their Fright Fest is great!! Full Throttle, X2, Tatsu, Drop of Doom and Apocalypse ate the best! Goliath and Batman are good as well but you can get a little tunnel vision going, even in the front of the train. With X2, you need to keep your head up and your legs back to truly enjoy the ride. And if you are only going there once and need to hit up a lot of rides, get there first thing and ride Full Throttle, then X2, then Tatsu, then Superman and then Apocalypse to avoid long ride times. Also, you must buy a funnel cake. It is almost non optional. It's a bit pricey, but its deluxe and a single funnel cake is more than enough for two people. My only warning notes: be prepared for parking costs, and don't bother with Hurricane Harbor. It's a terrible water park ~ out of respect for Magic Mountain's awesomeness, I wont go on and on about that, but if you really need your water park fix you're better off going to Raging Waters. But if coasters are for you, this is your park!",Tyler D
50,A day at Magic Mountain,I decided to go to Magic Mountain with my boyfriend because we needed a change of scenery and just wanted to have some fun. We rushed to each line hoping to get on as many rides as possible. We were only able to get on 5 rides because we were limited time because of the park hours and the best rides of course had the longest lines. I stood in line for Tastu for about fifteen minutes and the line never moved. Same for Superman. In order to have a great time I suggest you get there as soon as the park opens so you can ride everything twice get some snacks and relax then do some shopping. If you dont come early expect to wait in line forever and thats no fun. But I love Magic Mountain and will try to come three times a year instead of once every five years. I do wish they had more things to do for couples. I like the fact that they had promise rings and you can engrave anything on there. Would be cool if at the picture booth you had the option to get a key ring of the picture you took. Overall my favorite theme park.,Dawn W
50,Another great day at the park!!!,Strongly recommend you get the flash pass so you don't have to spend time in lines it's well worth the extra money especially if you're coming from a long distance away you'll have a great time!!;),Tworkman
40,Amazing!,Really needed 2 days here. Lots of different but thrilling rides & not as expensive to get in as other parks. The only thing that let it down for me was that the grounds seemed a bit neglected and the areas around the park weren't as attractive as Universal or Disneyland. Didn't have to queue long for some rides but then did for others which were longer than the markers said and this was very annoying. Liked the theme being super heros but only saw 2 characters all day and was disappointed the park was only open till 9pm on a Saturday night???? With all that said I love rollercoasters and I missed at least 5 that I wanted to go on so I will be going back!,Seirian K
50,Fun on a quiet day!,"Our own experience of this Six Flags park was really very good. We went on a Sunday (September 7th) and the park was pretty quiet. The longest wait we had was for X2, approximately 30 minutes, and oddly enough that was my least favourite ride - it's too contrived, and it smacked me about a bit! Comments about the lack of shade are quite true, but it's Southern California for crying out loud; you're clearly going to need need sun cream and a hat. Take one small bag & be prepared for the newer rides to have a paid-for locker system.The staff in the park were pleasant and seemed quite professional. Most of the rides were great - although as an old-school coaster fan I didn't see fit to queue up for the fancy super-fast newer ones. Goliath, Viper and Apocalypse were our favourites, and we managed to get walk-ons towards the end of the day :)We were impressed at the quality of the entertainment at the park, there was a band stage by one of the rides with a rather good live band... it's kind of a shame we discovered this at the end of the day.We were also pleasantly surprised at the prices - we weren't totally gouged. The 7-day advance entry ticket was decent value, food was at the upper end of reasonable, and souvenirs relatively inexpensive. The only annoying thing is, we live ~6000 miles away so can't exactly get a season pass! If I lived within driving distance, it's what you'd call a ""no brainer"".",AFurryBeetroot

30,Its ok...,"The park is certainly for familys with older kids - the rides are all large roller coasters - the little kids area is small. There is also NO SHADE in this park - when you are waiting for rides, you are in the sun - so come prepared. I think that the two other amusement parks in the area are better. I don't think I'll go back.",CLBrown67

10,"If you want the truth, read this.","I was a former employee, and if you want the truth about this park, keep reading. The machinery there is out dated. I'm talking in 100 degree weather you have to walk up a lift that's creaking and shaking and shuts down every 5 mins on jet stream, it's not safe. The rides aren't safe. The ""maintanence"" don't check out the ride every day. There's been cracks in the rides and broken seat bars. The staff is lazy and doesn't care about the peoples lives. I quit because they hire anyone, literally anyone to operate and have the lives of children in their hands. As an ex employee I worked with two people where one talked about murdering someone and the other one was a sexual offender, to the guest. To which the sexual offender still worked with us, and made me feel so unbearingly uncomfortable. They don't follow rules, and the supervisors are never around to assist the guests need or even the employees. The rides always break down to carelessness and foolishness. Disregard this filthy roller coaster madness.",LilyTr

50,Best THRILL rides ever been on.,"Did six flags on a 38 degree day and had the best time ive ever had a amusement park. Yes the wait times were rather lengthy at times, but once youve done the rides, you forget about queing up for them. Food can be rather costly if your there with a family, so a bit of advice would be take some snacks and drinks and avoid the costs if you can. Ive been to disneyland twice and enjoyed it very much, but as an adult enjoyed magic mountain more as the rides are more thrilling adult based rides. There are also rides that a little less thrilling but in there own way are just as good. Not much to dislike about this park, but if i had one gripe it would be the wait time for rides, as a fast pass is very expensive for this park...not really affordable. Overall, loved this park and would definately go back anytime.",wrightyoz
50,Fantastic rides,"Great park, great white knuckle rides, pay extra for flash tickets, the queues can be lengthy, 10 mins after gates opened x2 had a 90 minute wait. Full throttle is unbelievable. Do the Revolution first to see how it felt doing a full turn years ago then do full throttle, the difference is amazing. Take Photo ID for the flash card, they keep the id till you return your Gizmo. If you stay at the local Hilton just outside the park they run shuttle buses so you can take a break and a swim! for a couple of hours before going back for the evening. The Green Lantern was perhaps the scariest of rides I have ever done! Time to Retire",davewelly

50,The Best Six Flags Park!,"Six Flags Magic Mountain is the best of all the Six Flags Parks in the country both for the beauty of the park and even more so because of the massive number of extreme thrill rides found here. The crown for the park with the most thrill rides is a tug of war every few years usually between Magic Mountain in Valencia, California and Cedar Point in Sandusky, Ohio. I've been to Cedar Point and it doesn't even come close to the beauty and cleanliness of Six Flags Magic Mountain. I'm always glad when Magic Mountain reclaims the crown of most roller coasters/thrill rides. Even the older coasters are still loads of fun. Revolution was the first and original roller coaster to have a vertical loop in its ride back in the 70s and it's still a really fun coaster. If you ride it at night you have no idea where the upcoming loops and turns will come. Revolution, the coaster, has even been featured in a few movies. The ride first opened in 1976 and was featured in the movie ""Rollercoaster"" that came out in 1977. It was also seen at the end of ""National Lampoon's Vacation"" with the Griswold family enjoying the ride at the fictional WallyWorld Park. The ride Superman, the Escape is another ride that's been there a few years but remains loads of fun, racing over 100mph in just a few seconds to climb a 415 foot tower before rapidly descending back down the track. Every year this park adds a few new rides. It's located among the Hills of beautiful Valencia about a 30 minute drive North of Los Angeles. There's plenty of hotels right in the area.",0221Serendipity
50,Best team park ever,"Six-flags magic mountain is am overall must go to team parks if your in California. It's clean, nice and fun, it's a big park so there is a lot to see. You will never get bored cause in every corner there is something to see, play or ride. For the best visit bring proper walking shoes comfortable cloths and water. All the rides are fun, fast and friendly. There are a lot of nice fun games for kids as well as rides they will enjoy. There is something for every age and I have went there since is was 8, and still going now that am 19 you will never get tired of coming to six-flags magic mountain",Ingrid L
40,Not for the faint of heart ;),"...And you have to be willing to walk - a lot.But then again, anything worth doing will take some effort (right?) This one is quite simple, it's a roller-coaster park. If you like roller-coasters, you will like Six Flags Magic Mountain. If you are able to attend on a weekday (during the Summer) you will very likely save yourself a LOT of time of standing in a queue.Like coasters but tend to get motion sickness? Take one of those anti-motion/travel-sickness pills (I don't usually recommend medications for no reason, but trust me on this one. I've tried it with and I've tried it without.

30,Great roller coasters...shame about the facilities!,"Firstly the positives. We Had a fantastic day riding the roller coasters here! They have an amazing selection to suit all riders. I paid for the flash pass platinum as it was 104 degrees and we didn't fancy waiting in line. Even though it seems complicated at first it's quite a handy thing. Do it if you've got the extra $$$ and you've only got a small amount of time it does cut down the waiting time dramatically.Now...the major thing that let's this place down is the facilities, food was expensive and average with a lack of indoor air conditioned selections! Which is a killer in the heat. The toilets were the worst, all in terrible conditions, dirty, smelly, no maintenance at all! not a pleasant experience! No cooling systems in ride queue lines, it gets seriously hot whilst waiting! Probs the worst theme park I've been to for facilities it only gets 3 for there awesome roller coaster selection from me!",Ffion B

We got to create great memories by taking some pictures dressed in flapper clothing with guns as props. We walked a lot and water, deodorant and sunscreen is a must. We bought the plastic cup so we would refill the soda or iced water anytime for free. It was a great experience and at the end since there was no bday cake one of the girls bought a funnel cake for the bday girl we sang happy bday and endend our trip there. We came home tired but we screamed our lungs out!!! In my opinion I was glad that Tatsu was the last ride because if it would of been the first one I would of Not gotten in any of the other rides. it was a great experience :)",Verenize M

50,Coaster Heaven,"We skipped Universal studios for some real coasters at Six Flags, and the park did not disappoint. We did go for the flash pass platinum and yes it's expensive (you have to pay extra for x2 and full throttle) but if your only spending 1 day it's money well spent. Th day we went it looked like we would be ok with a gold flash pass.The coasters are outstanding and the best I've ever been on, and there is so many if them.",Fritzov
40,Good day out - bar eating,"Good value for a season pass, not a long wait for rides. I have to fault the food - it was v basic food I ordered the black bean burger at the veggie restaurant it cost $13 without a drink.

40,King of the Coaster Parks,"SFMM would have got 5 stars but I deliberately took away a point for the closure of Colossus. The parks management should be lined up against the wall and shot for killing off one of the best wooden roller coasters ever!They've still got some impressive roller coasters however, so many in fact that I had to by a ""flashpass"" to ensure I could get to ride them all in the limited park opening times (come on Six Flags, 7 1/2 hours on the Friday of the Labor Day Weekend? a missed opportunity I think)X2 is a beast, an outstanding 4th gen coaster worthy of several rides. However if you want to do this, be prepared to wait in line a lot or pay extra for special front of line privileges (X2 and Full Throttle are additional cost add-ons on the Gold and Platinum flashpass only, not on the regular flashpass)Full Throttle is a record breaking coaster but nothing outstanding imo and barely worth the huge waits it attracts.Tatsu is the best flying coaster I've been onApocalypse is a decent wooden coaster (the only ""woodie"" in the park since they killed Colossus)Green Lantern First Flight is a zakspin coaster and one of the most extreme things I've ever been on! at points it pulls insane g forces!Superman Escape From Krypton is a very good ride but to me only qualifies as a roller coaster by literal definition: the thrill is not really like a roller coasterthe other coasters are varied. Gold Rusher is almost a kiddie coaster, it is really tame compared to most of the othersOther than the coasters, there are not many other rides apart from in the kids section. A couple of decent water rides and a high drop tower ride, other than that just a handful of carnival ridesif you don't like roller coasters this is not the park for you. adrenaline junkies will love it though!",the_fatdonut

My honey is EXTREMELY excited to ride it and was very disappointed that he missed the Aug 16th closing date.",MR's Energizer bunny
40,Pure adrenaline,"If you want to test your limits go to magic mountain. From the moment you take the brochure you can read that every single roller coaster has some kind of record; the tallest one, the biggest loop, the fastest one.. You won't get bored. It can get too hot on summer though, so don't forget your water. Also, mind the lines. We didn't have any because we went on a friday and they close the park at 6pm, so people decide to go on saturdays when they close at 9pm.Apart from that the only con I could say is that everything is very focused on getting as much money as possible. I mean there are some attractions where you have to pay an extra fee (as much as 30$ can be found) for a single ride, I guess they are independent from the park and they pay a rent to be there but it shows a little bit how is everything built there.",jonruizz

50,Great fun park.,Excellent fun park that I have been visiting since 1978. Always a fun adventure. I have raised my three sons looking forward to the summer trip as a reward for their good behavior and good grades in school. It has payed off well. Also when relatives visit from out of state or out of country I also take them to magic mountain for a great family trip.,Walter H
50,Amazing rides for good value,"The key is to visit magic mountain midweek, simply because there aren't as many people there. If you do have to brave a weekend, or a Friday for those locals taking a long weekend, then the Fast Pass is a must if you want to avoid lengthy wait times queing for rides. When going mid-week, if you wait 10 minutes in a line for a ride, you picked the long line, which goes to show how small the queues are/can be.As much as everyone hates waiting in lines, at this park especially, it is essential if you want to try all the rides in a single day. Even then you may still fall short since this park has that many rides and attractions.This park is not for the faint hearted. It's for thrill seeking adrenaline junkies, there's no 2 ways about it. There is something like 19 rollercoasters + a variety of other thrill rides. For me, all my Birthdays had come at once. I could go on and on about how great the rides are and explain every ride to you but I think it's best to say that the rides are great and to let you experience everything yourself, without having me spoil anything for you.In terms of food, it's your standard amusement park food (hot dogs, burgers, chips and something for the kids). It's quite expensive but that's to be expected in every amusement park so you can't really complain. The park is pretty clean, although the eating areas are little dirtier but that's moreso due to some people just not knowing what a bin is as oppose to the park staff being lazy.Any merchandise is, as you would expect, expensive. There's jumpers, fridge magnets, soft toys, coffee cups; pretty much your standard amusement park merchandise. If you're into collecting this sort of stuff as momentos of where you've been, then there'll be something for you that takes your eye I'm sure.The price of entry, including transfers from Dinseyland (that's where we were staying for our visit) was about $100 each. When comparing this to somewhere like Dreamworld in Australia (the australian thrill seeking theme park), with Dreamworld not having half as many rides but still being $90 for an entry ticket alone, Magic Mountain is excellent value.All in all, if you're after a fun packed day at a fair price, then this is your place. I'll certainly be back next time I'm in the USA.",Kracker_1

50,Thrill rides galore!,"If you are looking for something a little more adult in your inner child experience, look no further! Magic Mountain Six Flags is a short trip from Los Angeles and is sure to ignite thrill and possibly fear as you partake of the many roller coaster and zip rides. Some of these rides are not for the slight of heart. It's hard to ever enjoy the thrill of the ride at other amusement parks once you have experienced Six Flags! We took advantage of the VIP treatment and it was well worth the price to not wait in any lines! We were fortunate to be one of the last of a relatively few riders to ride the Colossal Roller Coaster as it was retiring within a few weeks! My teeth still shatter from the wooden maiden!",Pamela D

50,great family day/,if you enjoy a little rush without risking your life this is the place. So many great coasters. I recommend going any time besides the summer school break. The crowds are large midsummer. even worse towards the end of the summer. Book your tickets on line at least 5 days in advance and save quite a bit of money. Also the $40. fast pass is well worth the money if used correctly it will all but eliminate waiting in line. The food is outrageously priced. eat before you go and as little as possible in the park. Also lots of hills and a ton of walking involved.,LuckysMatt
50,Awesome,"I had 24 hours in LA waiting for a connecting flight to New Zealand so decided to check this out. Was awesome.Getting there: Hired car from Enterprise LAX - paid for the GPS which made things hassle free. Stayed at Santa Clarita Motel = great. Was a Thursday - took less than an hour to get there just before 1am and about 2 and half hours to return at around 3pm.I could only spend 4 hours at the park so I:a) Booked ticket and parking in advance.b) Paid for the platinum flash pass in advance - this was vital as 1 hour queues for everyone else were only 5 minutes for me.c) Got a map of the park and planned where to go the day beforeI managed about 7-8 rides - this was going from ride to ride with a brief stop for lunch. By the end of 4 hours I had done everything I wanted to do and needed a rest.Highlights: Viper, Tatsu, Full Throttle (definitely pay extra to get on this if you have to), Goliath (I started blacking out on the bottom corkscrew), Superman, Lex LutherLearnings:a) The flash pass entries to the rides are not well marked - they are usually the ride exits.b) Go at 9:30am next time: I got to the gates at 10:20am and it was already busy - by the time I parked, got through gates and got my flash pass it was 11:10am.c) I should have paid an extra 15 bucks to add X2 on my pass - I went to X2 first and it was already an hour wait so I didn't do that ride.d) There are two instances of rides breaking down and people being stuck for a couple of hours in July and August (one at six flags LA and one at six flags Maryland). I hadn't factored this into my planning but hey I would have taken the risk and gone anyway, this was a terrific experience!",feeetup

We purchased our tickets online along with ""all you can drink souvenir cups"". We were very disappointed with this drink option. First off we found out they were selling the same deal at the park for less then we paid online. Second the stands that you can refill your cup closed about two hours before the park does. I would still recommend buying this package but do it at the park. When it came time to eat lunch we stopped at one of the burger/ pizza courtyards and had our teenage sons wait in line. After checking on them several times we found out only 4 employees were working this large courtyard. Long story short 1 hour later and $80 we got the food, and yes it wasn't what we ordered. Don't get me wrong I expect to pay through the nose for bad food at a place like this but an hour wait was crazy.

40,Coaster Heaven,"A visit to Six Flags Magic Mountain was well worth the wait we had to get into the park. The park opened at 10 am and they didn't open the gates til 10 am. The crowd was anxious to get into the park and ride rides. A bit unorganized in my opinion, and many people don't know what to do with their tickets at the entrance. The staff should be trained to assist these crowds of people.Great coasters here. Not one complaint. If we ran into a long line we skipped it and came back to it. The weather was great. Did the things we wanted to do and left. The restrooms were clean. The food was adequate for an amusement park. This park would be a do over in my book.",Sue B
50,Extreme rides,"For all lovers of the extreme experience, the Six Flags Magic Mountain is the best place. I highly recommend to visit the Park. I have fun every time I visit the park.",cubano14
50,Absolute Blast,"We had a perfect day at this Six Flags location. It was a little warm but, I am from the Texas Panhandle where it pushes 100 plus most days in the summer anyways. There were so many fantastic rides. Wow! There was something for everyone. We rode everything in the park with the flash pass. If you can afford it, get it. It is a little pricey but, this vacation to California was our big splurge so we figured it into our budget. So glad we did. Prices for souvenirs and food were not any more than what we have paid at any of the other parks we have been to. There were nine of us that traveled together and our trip to Six Flags was a true highlight.",Cyn T
40,Great for thrill rides,If you love roller coasters this is the place to go. The fast pass was worth every penny. You can cut your wait by 95 percent. It was great but did not apply to the two most popular rides they charged extra for these rides. Overall it was a great experience for the thrill seeker.,Travelwins7
40,Coasters!,"If you like crazy roller coasters, this is the place! Get there early and hit the big rides then. Can easily spend entire day here and definitely will come back. My son and I hit the park on a Wednesday at opening and rode the Collossus one week before it closed. We walked right on with no wait. Hit several other rides in that vicinity with little to no wait. Lines picked up later in morning and by afternoon they were very long. Longest wait was just over one hour for X2, the wildest thing I have ever been on. Actually worth the wait!",gtv66
40,Great roller coasters.,"Would like if the flash pass would be just 1 kind of pass and would get it as you walk in just like in Universal Studios. But you get in line to go in, then you have to get in line again to get flash pass and then they want you to upgrade for the better rides, I think everything should be included in 1 price. It eventully got really expensive.Also, need more women restrooms. It was ridiculous how long i had to wait all the time.",Barbie85648
50,Awesome coasters!,Well worth the admission with the number of rides that are there! The family prefers Magic Mountain to any other theme park in California and we've been to quite a few!,Sarah A
40,"If you love HEAT, go in August!","Unfortunately, I hate heat, but August was the only time we could make it there. It topped out at 105 on that Friday and for adults it was livable, miserable on the kids.Anyway, only got to ride 2 rides due to the kids getting heat-wasted. Goliath was shut down, rode Colossus, which is now shut down and in the process of demolition, was a blast. Viper X2 is awesome.Highly recommend wearing shorts with button pockets. Don't take in bags unless you want to rent a locker.Buy your tickets online and save $20 each. If you're going to be there for more than a day, get the platinum pass.Park was clean, I had no problems with it.",Reviewcius
50,Six Flag,"Excellent time we had. Get the Flash Pass. Money well spent.Don't forget to pack motion sickness pills, rides are pretty intense. As usual, food is very pricey. Must ride Tatsu.. Lines for X2 very long. No complaints",David S
50,Awesome,"My overall experience was really nice.I got on all my favorite rides and then some. I got on Superman and Full Throttle for the first time, which was awesome. Full Throttle really surprised me, I did not know it did all that aha it was a really fun ride. I do have to say that the line for Superman was a bit too long. It did not move an inch until like 2 hours later.The food is nice! I would have enjoyed the eating areas outside better if it had less bees flying around. Bu otherwise, I had a great time. The lines were short when I went, which was in August . I got on a lot of rides multiple times, including the rides that are usually long (X2, Goliath, etc). It was awesome",happiness_carter
40,For the kid in you...,Magic Moutain was my first amusement park as a child. I was terrified when I got there but once I went on that 1st ride I was hooked.I now can enjoy this park with my own daughter. It's always fun to go there. The experience is great to have at any age.,KeikiR
20,The magic is no longer there,"We visited on a Monday in August on a planned stop on our road trip. We actually visited back in 2007 and loved it so much we wanted to come back. It might be because we did visit Cedar Point last year, however this time following arriving at the park, we couldn't wait to get away. There were no ride closures, which was very good as we have heard a lot about issues they have. The crowd was as we expected, very rowdy teenagers/early twentys and groups that you didn't want to mess with. Queue jumping was the in thing, I managed to buck up the courage and say something once, and felt very intimidated when I did. The queues for the rides were quite long and it probably would help with a flashpass. We saw someone who did have a flashpass and the abuse they got from the gangs of teens, not very nice at all. X2 was wild, uncomfortably so but we enjoyed Full Throttle and Goliath. It just seemed like a theme park that does not give one thought to the people that make it money. I would without any hesitation visit Cedar Point again and again if I could, but I am afraid this is the last time we would visit Magic Mountain.",Samson55
50,Magic Mountain magic!,The park has changed so much for the better since I was a kid. So many activities for everyone in the family. So glad we purchased season passes this year.... so much value for the cost of a single trip!,Wendy W
40,Great adult park,"The Park is amidst 60 km from Los Angeles, and they have big choice of high thrill roller coasters. You will find the one standing, sitting or laying back.I recommend to go early in the morning to avoid crowd.",Mohamed Z
30,"Great rides, poorly managed.","We have done the Florida parks and liked the idea of one that focuses more on thrills and less on theme but came away thinking that the management should check out the competition to see how it should be run.Firstly the Flashpass system is expensive but a necessity during peak times of the year. You have to queue to collect your device and watch a training video while those without Flashpasses rush to get onto the best rides. Note for non US citizens they request a US driving license or photographic ID for them to keep as security although I am not sure of its value away from the park? They will accept a passport but I had nothing acceptable so had to pay $100 deposit returnable at the end of the day.The Flashpass does not cover the two newest rides in the park ""Full Throttle"" and ""X2"" which are an extra $15 each for a wristband to ride once without queuing which is outrageous in my opinion! By the time we had received the Flashpass devices the queue for these was already significant so we left them and ended up not going on either. Saying that the Flashpass system does work well allowing pre-booking of rides however there is no electronic queue management system so I am not convinced about the accuracy of the queue estimates on the device and it was difficult to tell if it was worthwhile as there are only rudimentary signs showing queue length on the rides with most of the queue hidden.The rides themselves were excellent, more suited to teenagers and young adults with the highlights being Colossus and Superman although Tidal Wave was not worth the wait! Loading the rides was very slow and seemed to take twice as long as with other parks with no real sense of urgency despite the long lines.We ate a JB's Grill, though food was expensive but OK and bought refillable souvenir cups, two between four as there is only so much Coke you can drink in a day! These are free to refill on the day of purchase and 99c after that throughout the season. They can also be used in the adjoining Water Park.There was little entertainment available while waiting apart from some old TV's showing even older cartoons on one of the rides. It is very hot in inland California during the summer and efforts were made to keep the guests cool with shade, fans and mists throughout the park but this did not stop a girl fainting while queuing for one of the water rides in an exposed area.All in all, while I would recommend the rides I would not necessarily recommend the park, especially peak season. It should be noted however, there are some excellent deals for yearly membership or multiple visits so if you live locally it is more attractive removing the pressure to go on as many rides as possible in as short a time.",Steve F
50,Great fun with friends,I absolutely love six flags.... My only complaint is that quite a few of the rides are typically small (harnesses/seats) it's not really a park for bigger people. I wish they would have extension harnesses or something to accommodate bigger people.,Gabriela R
50,Excellent,The day at the park was all round very enjoyable. Most of the rides didn't have long lines. Plenty of places to cool down. Only one ride not operating that day but was running later that afternoon. It's a great place for friends and family to hang out with and chill for the day.Only one concern was the length of time to be served food after paying for it.Absolutely great experience otherwise. Totally recommend it.,dublinboi77
50,Farewell Collossus,"We came here to ride Collossus for the last time and ended up having an amazing time! Magic Mountain set it up so you could take souvenir photos in a Collossus car and also take photos as the Griswalds and with the family station wagon. It was awesome! I'm so glad we got to go and get our last ride on such an iconic roller coaster! We also rode Tatsu and I forgot how freakin' scary it is! We love Magic Mountain and will miss Collossus but, can't wait to see what they replace it with!",starrynite6881
10,Magic mountain - don't bother,"Run down, poor facilities . Queued for an hour just to get lunch. No electronic wait times, in fact on some rides no wait times shown at all, even though they were over an hour. Dirty toilets, uncleared rubbish, no information given when ride broke down when queuing. I don't think this park has been updated for at least 15 years, which makes you wonder about the rides. Far far worse standard than any theme parks in the UK.",mosemant
40,Fun with the kids,"Overall a great way to spend time with our older kids. The day was perfect, not too hot. The only downfall was that everything is soooo expensive. Luckily I knew this already so I went prepared, like I always do. We ate a good breakfast before we got there. We spent $18 on 1 funnel cake (which we split between 4 people) And for lunch, We got our hand stamped and went to our car, where we had a ice chest full of sandwiches, chips, drinks. The only thing you are allowed to take in the park is bottled water. Plus I was able to sneak in a few granola bars.",Sightsee453794

50,Fast pass info.,"i just returned from magic mountain and wanted to share with you all the info I experienced with the whole trip. We bought the season passes for my wife and i and arrived the evening before to process the pass at the park before our real visit the next day. We arrived about 7pm and there was no line to process the pass, i just gave em our printout and got the passes with all the extra perks sheet. Each pass can bring in a friend for free through august 29. Each pass can get 2 for 1 gold fast pass until 1/5/15. We walked the park that night and went to the fast pass entrance(exit for the ride) and ask a guy what pass to get and he said platinum. The next day we decided to use the two-for-one gold fastpass. You can get into the park with your gold season pass 15 minutes before everyone else is allowed in. We arrived a little late and by the time we got to the Metal detectors it was already 1030 and the park had open. If you do want to get in early 15 minutes before I suggest you arrive by 915 to park and go through the metal detector(we got bottled water into the park). The gold pass line is to the far right of all the gates. Once you get to the fast pass area straightahead from the gates you have to watch a five minute video on how to pass works and then you process it and your free to ride. In the beginning the overall experience with the gold pass was really nice. I would put in the ride that I wanted to go on and it was about a 15 minute wait which was the same amount of time to walk there, once they scan you you can put in the next ride but as the day progressed and the park got crowded the wait time was about 45 minutes to an hour which means I waited half the time. Towards the end of the day(last hour) I would reserve a ride and arrive at that ride after waiting for 30 minutes and there was no fast pass line available. Overall the gold fast pass was nice we were able to ride every ride we wanted to at least once or twice With maybe a 20 to 25 minute wait between 1pm-7pm as long as you did it after you got Scanned for the ride you just got on, if not you could wait 35 minutes. If you have the money I would recommend the platinum fast pass but since we had a two-for-one deal with the gold season pass we decided to give it a try but next time I think I will save up for the platinum season pass because your only waiting 10 minutes for each ride. I really think it's a sad fact that an amusement park would separate the rich and the poor but in general our whole country is turning that way from poor doors to luxury apartments in Manhattan to $30 beers at the new 49er stadium. Hope this is helpful, save up and spend the money if you can but get there when they open because their is only a certain amount of fast passes sold each day unless you do it online a day before. Another tip, yes they have $1 lockers at every ride but if it's not valuable then you can set by the exits when you board the ride, no one stole anything from us and I left a fanny pack on the side without anything important in it several times without any problems",John A
20,Pros and Big Cons!,"Excellent rides for extreme thrill seekers, but not great for a family day out. As a family of British thrill seekers (one with special needs) we were looking forward to stopping off on our Best of the West road trip for a day at 6 Flags. Compared to previous Disney and Universal experiences in Florida this theme park failed to deliver. We were given a special pass for our disabled son which allowed us to spend q times elsewhere - so no preferential treatment (which was fine) but equality of access which worked well. However the majority of the rides were really too extreme for him , so if you are a uk holiday maker with a child with special needs think carefully - this park is like Alton Towers on Steroids so might not be suitable.I really felt that the park lacked the brilliant American customer service style so prevalent in Florida. At times I felt like we were in England at Thorpe Park. Toilets were dirty, admission time (10.30) was crowded and disorganised and the catering outlets shambolic. What I really objected to, however0, was the rip off culture regarding drinks. You are not allowed to take your own food or drink in to the park, so we bought refillable drink cups - great idea we initially thought. Getting your drink refilled was a different matter though - refillable points are either within main food outlets or few and hellishly busy. I felt physically ill as we waited over 40 minutes to get a drink. In temperatures as hot as it gets here I think this is irresponsible of the Park. The situation could easily be sorted by having a fast track queue in eating outlets just for drink refills as opposed to making customers wait behind others making complex food orders. Funnily enough there are loads of opportunities to buy chilled bottles of drink around the park and so I ended up feeling like this refillable drink business was nothing more than a money spinner! Have come back early from the park with my youngest son - but my husband and eldest are still there enjoying the thrills of the challenging rides. It's just a shame I found this park a challenge for all the wrong reasons!",Mumsnetter
40,Great day out but get ready to queue!,"The coasters are brilliant, especially Tatsu, and if you book in advance online, you get $25 off the gate price. The weather when we were there was super hot, but there was only one water cooling area in the park. The only thing, and it is a big gripe of mine, that spoils this park is the visitors that pay a ton of cash extra to get the flash passes. They get to walk straight onto the ride in front of everyone else in the line. I know that we all have the opportunity to buy the flash pass, but we are a family of five and simply can't afford it. The fast pass system in Disney is better, when everyone has the chance to jump a queue equally. The food and drink are expensive, and you have no choice because they do not allow you to take in your own food and drinks. But, the coasters are fantastic, and we were lucky enough to get on and ride Colossus before it closes on August 16th this year.",The_Whybird

50,Best amusement park for THRILLS!,My all time favorite rides are Superman and Drop of Doom. Six Flags never fails to improve the park and add new rides.,elly665
40,Flash Pass,On busy days without a Flash Pass your experience will be very poor. 60-90+ minute waits make for disappointment for a 90-180 second ride. While the rides are excellent this is just the reality of a growing population. Plan to spend on peak days. I purchased Flash Passess immediatley following the first 45 minute wait...smiles all around and topics of conversation did not runout. What will happen when everyone has a Flash Pass is the question.,Mark S
20,Run down and poorly managed.,"We just returned from Six Flags Magic Mountain and I'm beat. First off, lines were long but didn't have to be. We waited in countless lines that had showed 30 minute waits from the gate, but that actually lasted closer to 90 minutes. Why? Because these rides weren't running all the cars, and the flash pass people we're let on as they arrived. This was particularly troublesome on the Green Lantern ride. Each car sends eight people and they send one car at a time. The normal line would just wait, while 6 people trickled in on Flash pass, they would then let 2 people in the door, then run the car. Three minute later there are 7 more Flash pass people, so they would get in immediately, and one regular customer would get in. I wouldn't complain about this normally if they were more honest about length of the line. But getting in a line described by the park to be 30 minutes long only to wait for 90 minutes (and 95% of the time there is no shade), because the employees cater to Flash Pass customers only, can really leave me with a bad attitude for the park. By the way I mentioned to one of the attendants that the line was closer to 90 minutes, and he said thanks, but later the line was even longer and the wait time still said 30 minutes.One of the other problems I had with Six Flags was the state of disrepair in the lines. Often there were TVs showing Bugs Bunny cartoons to keep you entertained in line, but only two rides turned the TVs on. Fans weren't on either. As you leave the Batman ride there are hand rails so rusty and old, that Six Flags added additional handrails screwed on to the originals so you wouldn't get hurt. I'm glad for the new rails, but couldn't they demolish the old ones? It looks tacky. I realize it's not a Disney kind of place, it's half the price, but Cedar Point is similarly priced and it's much much nicer than Magic Mountain. People from the Midwest! If you're hoping for a nice west coast alternative, you won't find it here.",gaslampcaribbean
40,Fun times,6 flags Magic Mountain was a lot of fun. The real problem was the long lines. We ended up leaving in early afternoon and then came back around 6 pm and the lines were much shorter. Riding the X2 was the best. That is the best coaster I have every been on. Superman was cool also. Food and drink prices are very expensive.,fool4travelin
50,Six Flags Magic Mountain,"Six Flags Magic Mountain provided me the most great experience of all time. The employees were very nice, the park was clean and the rides were really safe. They checked us twice each time and they gave us our time of our life. If you are a thrill seeker and you are willing to have a great fun this is the six flags you should visit.",Tedi F
30,Good,"Having been a coaster enthusiast all my life, Six Flags was always a little dream, being so far away in California! I got enough money together to eventually go!!! The rides are amazing BUT, the park closed at 5 and that, with queues is no way near enough to get on everything. The park wasn't even that busy either so god knows what it's like on a busy day. I went back to the UK having not been on some of the rides which really annoyed the absolute hell out of me. The hole day was spent rushing around as we had such little time. I have never known a theme park, with such guaranteed beautiful weather, close at 5, in August!!?!?! I left quite angry that Six Flags had let me down and didn't live up to my expectations. Thank goodness the rest of California was mind blowing! Six Flags-you still owe me a ride on at least four of your coasters!!!!",Bobbyhols
40,Great fun if you like coasters,We loved this sixflags.It is very big with a lot of coasters.Also did like the restaurants so many choices..,amerikafan53
50,Thrills thrills and more thrills,"Omg if you're a theme park junkie and love an adrenaline rush this is a must.

We screamed,we laughed,we got on every ride & had the most awesome time,we would definetly go back again.",Galvin1972
50,Go for it!,"While rather pricey, the new Flash Pass program made our day so much more enjoyable. We estimate that without the pass we would have been able to ride 8-9 times. With the platinum Flash Pass ($100 each) we were able to ride 16 times! Plus NO hassle of waiting in line. Save up for this perk. WELL worth it!",2003Katherine
50,Thrilling experience,Fantastic fun park for especially the older ones as the roller coaster rides are brilliant. Superman is a must!Went on a scorching hot day so thank god I got the flash passes to go straight to the front of the queues. A good tip for these is just buy the gold version as the platinum version would not be worth the extra money. Book your next time on a flash pass ride while you are getting on the ride before so no delays.By the way if the owners of six flags are reading this then take away the charge for parking the car as it is a real rip off!Also put some healthy option eating places on the complex as not everyone wants to eat crap all the time.,Tony M
20,Big Headache,"My family has been to both Universals (Fl and Ca), Disney world in Orlando, six flags St. Louis, six flags Atlanta, six flags great adventure, cedar point, and kings island. By far, this was the worst park!!! Their policy on fast passes is ridiculous!! Basically you pay 30$ per person for an option that Disney provides for free. Their system is messy and not efficient. For Example: we were waiting in line for Superman, for which only one of two cars were operating. There were so many flash pass people that the regular line barely moved. We were 100 ft away from the loading zone and it took us 2 hours. Had this been Universal studios, they would have had both cars in operation, with one being used for fast pass and the other for regular guests. Why spend tens of millions of dollars, just to cut your loading capacity by 50%!!!!???? There was no signage indicating the ride was down at all. The bathrooms are messy and outdated. It took me 20 minutes to wait in a line of maybe 6 people, just for ice water. The cashier looked like he didn't know how to count money! It was over-crowded, poorly managed, and a big disappointment!",Zombie_slayer
50,Fun Visit,"My wife and I visited the park on consecutive days. The first day (Friday) was extremely hot and we arrived mid-afternoon. We only rode 3 rides, but the lines were super short. We got on Revolution almost immediately, and it was a very fun first ride. The second day (Saturday) we arrived at opening. Getting into the parking lot was fairly easy, but the crowd at the entrance gate was horrible. They need a more efficient way to get the crowds through the gates. Once inside, we got into line for Full Throttle and only waited about 10 minutes. As the day went on the lines got longer, but we never waited more than about 30 minutes. We got to ride Colossus, which closes in a couple of weeks! Most of the rides were enjoyable, but the Green Lantern ride was horrible. I've never been tossed around like that. Neither my wife nor I enjoyed it all. We stayed only about 4 hours, but got to ride plenty of rides while we were there.Overall, the park was a lot of fun. Lots of trees for shade, and many, many roller coasters. We can't wait to go back!",Nathan R
50,Great Park,I am a theme park/rollercoaster junkie. We have visited almost every theme park in the US. Six Flags Magic Mountain was a great park. Lots of rides of all types and sizes. Lots to do for everyone. The lines weren't overly long. The park was well maintained. I would definitely recommend this park.,Chris G
10,Waiting to squeeze out every dime,"Parking is now up to $20/vehicle. Not even Disney charges that.Next, in addition to paying for admission or season passes (which will require you to allow them to scan your fingerprint, hope that doesn't alarm you 'cuz you can't opt out) expect to pay for the flash pass or wait in line for hours. And why is the wait so long? Why, because they are continually loading flash pass guests onto the ride in front of you. Nothing more fun than explaining to your 10 year old that the reason people are ""cutting the line"" is because they paid more for the privilege. Neither Disney nor Knotts does this. Can someone explain to me why MM feels the need to charge richer patrons for the privilege of cutting in line in front of those who don't pay extra for that perk? At least at Disneyland the flash pass for the most crowded rides is open to EVERYONE at the park, you just have to take the time to check in for the system. Very democratic. Not at MM, here it is just for people willing to pay more to jump the line. It's very troubling to me that the park has set up a two-class system. If my admission money is not enough, than raise prices across the board rather than implementing this two-class system.Don't know where that extra money is going to, but it's not to janitorial staff. Park was dirty, particularly the bathrooms. Food was atrocious, and don't think of bringing in your own because they will search your bag and confiscate it. Again, not something that Disney or Knotts does.Finally, I bought season passes last year for this year and because I didn't process them at the season pass center by January (one month? Seriously? The pass says 2014, which means ALL of 2014) they knocked off my parking and gold status, which my receipt clearly shows I paid for. Complained to guest relations, no luck, sorry, we can't change that. Wrote a letter to corporate and was contacted and told they would only restore parking on one pass (paid for 4) and no gold status even though we'd paid for it because we'd violated the ""terms of agreement"" by not processing by the end of January. Yeah, Magic Mountain, we won't be back. Funny I've heard so much about how this park can't make money but they don't seem to value repeat business.",mstvr
40,Kids had a blast,"The rides were great and my teenagers loved the ultimate thrill rides. I missed a bit of the Disney charm and my head hurt by the end of day 2 from all the ride-jostling. But my kids got what they wanted, big roller coasters and we had a great family vacation.",Stacey S
50,Get the flash pass,"This was recommended by our hotel concierge after being really disappointed with Disneyland. After I pulled into the car park I was bursting with excitement as there are more roller coasters than most normal people can handle especially if your used to the lame rides at Disneyland. We got the flash pass as we were so sick of waiting in lines all day, it was awesome straight to the front of the line and the ability to just keep on riding felt like a VIP. After about 5 hours of non stop roller coasters I physically couldn't do anymore I think I had motion sickness there is no better way to finish the day",Cameron H
30,Upsetting! It's no wonder people will pay the big bucks for Disneyland and universal studios:(,"Six flags management should be very disappointed with their current product and overall amusement park experience. I'm a season pass holder and I couldn't be more upset with park experiences this year. I don't even know where to begin this review. I guess I'll start with the season pass processing center. The young employees were nice, but had no customer service skills. Nothing was explained or given to us, except a barcoded pass with my name hand written on the back. I specifically paid the extra $50 for the parking pass and another additional $100 for the all-you-can-eat season pass! Again, no flyers or pamphlets given to explain the process or rules for the program. After getting into the park @7 pm on our first visit we wanted to take advantage of our season dining pass. Only to discover that all of the restaurants on the back side of the park were closed well before their posted closing times! Isn't the goal to try to sell your customers and visitors food? Don't you make significant profit on a $12.99 souvenir soda bottle. We were very discouraged to find that 3 of the restaurants that were supposed to accept our dining pass had closed. After having to walk to the front of the park we were finally explained how the cash register system shuts down at 7:30 and you can no longer use your dining pass. Again, customer service could've and should've five the right thing and honored our season dining pass, but instead a long argument and debate ensued and we ended up leaving the park! We ended up returning to the park the following week, with our hopes much higher. The rides and lines were fantastic as usual, but we noticed how dirty, rundown, and unappealing many parts of the park appeared. Broken wooden fences hiding trash bins are in much need of fresh paint, many of the shops could use a facelift and a more modernized decor, and we couldn't even enjoy our BBQ meal due to the excessive amounts of yellowjackets hovering all around the picnic eating areas. Needless to say were were ready for another early departure. Lastly, what happened to the tram cars to return visitors to the parking lots? They now make 100's of visitors cram onto a got, sticky bus to get returned to the main parking lot. Does it really save that much money?? Six flags has potential to be an elite amusement park, but they need management to take a few lessons from Mickey Mouse and friends!",Beifert
40,"Incredible roller coasters, great fun","This park has many of the most incredible roller coasters in the world, we bought the platinum pass and totally worth it, we did everything before 5 pm. Tip, dont forget aspirins, if you are going tobe in the roller coasters all day, you are going to need some. Have fun.",Horacio Victoria
20,Poor management and falling standards,"Third visit to six flags and not a great experience.Got there early and had tickets over Internet so saved $20 dollers each. Didn't save time !!!! Security checks really slow but i do appreciate the need ( think they are more trained in food and drink being taken in the offensive weapons though!)Then we lost around 30 minutes to actually get through ticket turnstiles . ( pretty obvious this is. A delaying tactic to filter people into park as suddenly it speeded up! )Park really busy but they don't alter their approach to people / q management ..... Really poor. Couple of rides down.... Batman and ninja which puts pressure on other rides but 90 minute wait for major rides takes a chink out of your day......really frustrating when you get to the front with in motivated staff going through the motions.....slow filling, empty seats and spare vehicles.....come on six flags......gear up , train up for busy days.....your customers deserve better or you will end up rejected.Food, shocking prices poor quality and service.....HELLO ! I went for over priced bean burger. Five people behind counter, 1 serving , one cooking other chatting, wandering around. Closed window after a number of orders so people could get drink refills!!! Young , unmotivated staff. I work in retail and customers wanted to spend, even at inflated prices and couldn't get served. They could be so much better. Six flags management, take a look at staff in Disney or universal.....aspire to be great or your down the grate!!!",Geoffsmith123
10,Save your money unless you like standing in line,"We were at Magic Mountain on Weds 7/30 and the lines were really long, there were several rides not working. Some rides only had 1 car running making the wait time way longer than it should have been. The bathrooms were dirty and smelly. We have been to Six Flag over Georgia and Six Flags Great America and enjoyed both of those parks and rode more rides with bigger crowds than were at Magic Mountain. We made a special trip to go to this park and didn't even get to go on all of the rides we wanted too because the lines were so long. I wish we had gotten an extra day at Disneyland instead of going here. We will not return",DeeYinPA
10,Disappointed in the Customer Care of Magic Mountain Staff:,"Recent visit to Magic Mountain was less than desired. I had more than one problem, daughter lost her glasses one Green Lantern, ride. Went to lost and found a the young man their was like are they shades? I replied n o they are her glasses for her vision. WE were told that we could wait and see if one of the employees found them when they did the evening sweep. Ask how long is this wait 11/2 hours. Mind you its already 10:00 pm. The level of Customer Services through out the park was horrible. And I say that because Management needs to be overhauled, their were a lot of people in the park on yesterday and I have seen more. Went to the Snack Shop to purchase a Slurpee waited in line for more than 20 minutes to get to the window and have the person attending the area say I'm out of cups, can't honor your special, you can go over to the Waterfront Cafe and see the Supervisor name Jo Anna. I did to have her tell me that they were short handed in staff and now if I wanted one I could always go over near Goliath or the Cyber cafe. Mind you the places she sending me to are one the other side of the park from where I'm presently located. I also observed employee of the park walking around (just walking in circles). When asked why they had filled the shack shop with cups prior to running out if the other locations had cups, their was no answer. End of the story Very Disappointed in the Staff yesterday at Magic Mountain, from Customer Relations to over all training in Customer care.",Deidra- L
50,Impossible Physics,"For the roller coaster buffs out there looking for the best bang for your buck, this is the place for you. Way cheaper than Disneyland, but more on equal footing with Knott's Berry Farm. Nobody can touch Knott's food, especially the Chicken House, but Magic Mountain's X2 is unparalleled in Southern California. From its face first vertical initial drop to its spinning seats, this thrill ride keeps you guessing which way is up and ""how is this even physically possible""? Way too many amazing rides to even mention. Just find the longest hours open on the Six Flags website and go. Just remember to bring a cooler of your own food. Lockers and the Picnic Pavilion are just inside the gates (you'll thank me later).",Terri A
30,Lines are too long !,"Great rides - no doubt about it !! BUT you will have to spend 80% of your time in the lines unless having one of the fast track passes. The signs telling you the waiting time are manually operated, and we experienced in 9 out of 10 cases, that the waiting time was double up. The food quality is inversely proportional with the prices (that is low quality and high prices.....). Up to 4 USD for a Coke. The ticket price is low (unless if you buy the fast track, which is quite expensive), but you will get ripped by the parking, storage of bags (as they are now allowed on the rides), food and drink prices.",Martin L
20,Only for teenagers,"Our recent trip to Magic mountain was a miserable experience. Our group broke up into 2 groups between older and younger children. The older children and young adults had a fabulous time. The younger group were miserable the entire day. It was quite hot and there was little shade in the little kid area. Misters would have been appreciated. The little kid rides were mediocre and the show was lame. It would have been nice to have more shows or somewhere to cool off. The little kid area seems to be an afterthought. It was clean and safer than we heard it to be, but we would have been better off going to a local park and playing on the playground or a McDonalds playland. Magic Mountain is a waste of money for anyone under 42 inches. If you are over 42 inches get there early even before opening and ride the most popular rides first. Prepare to pay $20 for parking. Fast passes are $40 and not really needed on the week days. They do let you take in water bottles even though there are signs that say no outside food allowed.",190cheryls
40,Try and get platinum passes or deal with hell,"I would go to great lengths to get the gold or platinum passes to make the day worth while, otherwise its 7 hours of being in the line versus 20 mins of actually being on rides. If you have a busy job, limited time with the kids and LOVE roller coasters, then do what you can to upgrade otherwise you'll have a better day on the beach. Six Flags - if you read this - PLEASE put some more cover on the entrance so people don't get sunburned to pieces on the way in. Please also open up more healthy food places, have we not gone past the stage now where everyone wants chips and burgers?!",whisper26
50,Pleasant Surprise!,"We went on a Thursday. We got there early and left around 7 p.m. We were able to get on many rides and most had a wait time of less than 30 minutes, and some with no wait at all. We found it to be clean, friendly, and very safe. Totally going to go more often and, oh yeah, the funnel cakes are AWESOME!",funnelcake
50,I love this place!!!!,"If you are a fun of adrenaline This is the best place for you to spend the whole day.start from the early morning , as lot's of People are crowded already before the gates/ in cars/super well organisation of shuttles will help you to transfer from the parking to the park. Prepare your mood and be patient as everywhere you need to wait between 40-90 Minutes. if there are 7 thriller rides you need to prepare 7 hours of stay ( at least) to experience each of the ride.i started from goliat. it already raised level of my adrenaline to such a level, that i didn't want to waste my time on eating, just riding and riding as hell. absolutely mandatory is X2, the most crazy rollercoaster i have ever been. full recommendation! at the end, don't forget to take icecream from cold stone creamery as they are the best out of the bests.yummy and have fun!",ebuggy
40,"Expensive, they are seriously gouging but rides are awesome","If you find this helpful, please click helpful below.The park is expansive and loaded with 19 roller-coasters. I would advise to only come here with kids over 48"" or you'll be somewhat disappointed.The superman rides are thrilling, viper was cool...The fast passes work, but they are crazy money. Not sure i would go without them. (Be aware) X2 & Full Throttle are NOT included in the fast passes!!!!! REALLY SIX FLAGS?They charge $20 for parking, $45-50 for each ticket, food is expensive, then they charge extra for fast passes 40-100$ per person then they didnt include the 2 newest rides. I found this awful and it really makes me never want to return to a six flags park.The place is in the middle of no where - almost desert so plan for temps 20 degrees higher than LA!We all got heat stroke.The rides made the day, my boys got on every ride pretty much that they wanted.Tip: Bring a discover card or Honda key's and you will get in the faster line while waiting for the park to open. Buy tickets online save money and time.",Tripking07
50,Amazing!,"One of the best theme parks I have ever visited!Excellent rides, very well kept and we didn't queue for long.Photos can be purchased on most rides, not too expensive.Food stalls located around the park are good and not too expensive.The gift shop is very good, also not over priced.However the water was quite expensive, the cheapest we found was 2 bottles for $6.Cooling stations around the park are very helpful!I highly recommend and would love to visit again!!",Emily S
20,disapointing,"We weren't allowed to bring any food or drinks into the park. And the food offered in the park is horrible. If you are gonna enjoy your stay you have to spend money on a flash pass, or else you're just gonna be standing in line all day in the heat.",Atanone
50,Good family trip for older kids,"Magic Mountain has made an effort to keep the park clean and provide relevant themes throughout. The rides are definitely not for the fainthearted, and there are not too many relaxing experiences, but the family bonding is great, and it is a day well spent. Make sure your kids are tall enough for most of the rides before visiting!",ohiostangel
50,I'm in love.,"I'm a self-confessed roller coaster nut, and was fortunate enough to get here in summer with a few mates from LA and it was an amazing time.It was quite busy, given the time of year, but we paid for one of the express passes (which I highly recommend as it ""books"" in times for you to skip the lines at all the major rides) so all in all it was pretty easy to get around and ride on everything. And ride we did!In terms of the overall atmosphere, it's a theme park, so everything you'd expect. Obnoxious families, horrendous children, loud teens...but without all that, how dull would it be?! The food is expensive (no shock) but who eats a lot of food when there SO MANY COASTERS! Prepare yourself for a long day with loads of walking, and budget for the fact that it's an expensive day out - but totally worth it!Three main must-dos are:GOLIATHI rode something very similar in the Six Flags Arlington, and this brought back all those amazing memories. High. Fast. Old school. And a thumping, wind in your face scream-fest. Incredible.TATSUThis ride lives up to expectations. High, tense and so unbelievably terrifying. It sits on top of a hill in the park, so everything feels MUCH higher than it is (particularly the initial climb) but nothing compares to the forward loop...you see it coming and it owns you in every great way possible.X2Saving the best til last...do this before you die, that simple. It moves in ways roller coasters shouldn't move (the first 15 seconds after the initial drop are burnt into my brain) and the adrenaline is nonstop from the moment the brakes release. Fire...height...and speed...GET ON THIS RIDE.DO NOTEAt the time, with the express pass, it only worked once with X2 and Tatsu so going around and around isn't really an option. The line for X2 (which you wander straight past...) was round 3 hours before midday...so plan for it.CRITICISMSA few of the coasters are nearing the end of their lifespan - they shouldn't be jarring at any point, and this is indicative of one nearing retirement for me.The lines are brutal for those that don't have the express. It's to be expected, but even I was surprised how long they were for the major rides.It would be nice if the grab and go food had a little more variety, but it is what it is!OVERALLGet there immediately.",PoolBarPlease
50,Great six flags mountain,It's great place for those looking for excitement and fun. The place not far from Los Angeles and takes around 45 minutes from Pasadena / Glendale/ Burbank. It fits for teenagers and adults. Not recommended for who have heart problems or breath difficulties.,ALBADEEN
50,Crazy fun adventure,Love six flags one of the best theme parks I've ever gone to. Te rides and flash pass are the best thing ever inveted if I could go everyday I would go.,Gustavo N
10,Worst park I visited,"The lines were very long for every ride, they don't have optimization lines for singles (I saw many toys departing with empty sits and I was still waiting there), the food is bad and expensive, the staff is not friendly and it is not trained to help you, they do not allow you to enter the park with your food, even a single potato ships (my case). Will not come back there :-(",Eduardo R
50,Fun for coaster riders,"If you love coasters this is the place . Very exciting and fun , crowd not too bad in the morning but got busier as the day got hotter. Waited in line for a couple of rides only to get turned away because of malfunctions. But all and all super fun.",Trilby C
50,Awesome,Great place and awesome rides. You get a lot for what you pay.This is my absolute favorite place and I never get tired of coming back. It is a must stop for everyone who is in southern california,dmeyers2012
20,No consideration for Disabled Visitors,"This park is full of incredibly steep hills. This would require the use of motorized wheelchairs, which the park should rent. The idea of a disabled person trying to move about under his own arm strength is ludicrous. Yet, the park only rents non motorized wheelchairs. With all those steep hills, the park becomes non friendly to the disabled.Another problem with the park is that there are always problems with the rides. When I was there, only three of the roller coasters were working, and NONE of the main attraction coasters worked until an hour before closing. No notices telling us this was made on the park website.The staff was rude and seemed uncaring of any concern. The park was dirty with litter in thwe bushes and walkways. I will NOT be visiting this park again. My kids said they enjoyed visiting the slums of Hollywood more than this park.",Craig M
30,Six Flags,The lines were very long for every ride. The food was not that great for the price they charge. It was far from the hotel was located.,Maria T
50,Thrilling rides,"The rides are just amazing. So many thrilling rides at one place. But there is also a lot of a little less thrilling rides for a little less brave. We enjoyed our visit. Come there early, because it is a long line for parking and later it get crouded in there.",Ana K
50,Mini Family Reunion,I had great time with my family at Six Flags Magic Mountain. My family and I plan to visit again before the year is out.,Kameshia B
40,Great park with issues,"Went here again last week and it was a similar story to my first visit, no idea why the park opens so late, it drives you mad to enter the park then be stuck in the middle section until 10.30am in the heat, small grumble though.The rides are uniformly excellent, if you want to ride X2 go straight there as soon as the park opens as the queue moves painfully slow.The park needs to open SINGLE RIDER lines, lost count of the amount of trains leaving the stations with so many spare seats when the queues were building up, it would be a lot more efficient to fill these up?Food is also pants and very expensive but most parks are like this the world over.Also if you are a big guy, chest, waist or whatever then the likelihood is you won't get on many rides, my friend managed about 3 and then the rest he had to sit out due to his chest measurements.",smabury
50,This place surpasses all others for theme park frills,"It doesn't have the overall professionalism of a Disney or Universal park, but if it is pure adrenalin inducing and excitement producing theme park rides you want, Six Flags has no equal.We've been to all of the primary UK parks, have visited Universal and Disney in Florida as well as California, and can say without contradiction that in our view this theme park has it all. We spent a full day there (until 7pm), and went on all of the big rides. Their 'Flash Pass' system was excellent and meant we didn't have to wait longer than 10 minutes. I could wax lyrical but words won't do it justice. If you can get there, please visit. You won't regret it.",Celtic_traveller165
50,Great Roller Coaster Park & even great for younger kids!,"I've been to Magic Mountain many times over many years and would highly recommend a visit here, if you like roller coasters. We belong to a roller coaster club (ACE) and visited last month. Most of the thrill rides here our a lot of fun and some are extremely exciting! Tatsu, Full Throttle, & Riddler's Revenge all are currently world record holders for their style of coaster. Things change all the time, but they have a lot of record holders at the moment and I'm sure many of the coasters have been on top lists over the years.Now that I have a 3 yr. old, I can tell you that they have a lot of good rides and attractions for the little ones as well. He was able to ride 3 coasters and now would be able to ride their newest coaster. He really enjoyed the Looney Tunes area and all the rides there, also. They have a large playhouse full of soft Nerf like balls, which he could've played all day in. He had a blast and so did we with all the attractions that they have.I think they currently have 18 or 19 different coaster tracks there, so there is lots to see and do. They have a jet stream ride, which is like a log ride, which has been at the park forever, but you don't see rides like it around. Their raft ride and new Lex Luther Drop Tower are both very exciting, as well.Most of the time this park has enough attractions that the waits aren't bad, but I would still recommend weekdays or early in season or off season weekends. In 2015, they probably will have a really good wood or wood hybrid coaster where Colossus is, but try to get there to ride it before it is gone. It is still a good classic wood coaster. Only real negative for me is expensive parking and not quite enough hotels around the area to keep the prices down.This is definitely an amusement park you will want to visit!",Bruce F
50,Incredible,"This was one of the best parks I have ever been to. Surprisingly, because it actually isn't much of a tourist attraction, even though we went in the middle of summer it was surprisingly empty, and we were able to get on almost every ride with little waits. The park itself was incredible. It has countless big roller coasters, so it's impossible to get on them all. The roller coasters could have all been headliners, and were all fast, huge, and fun. The best ride there was the Tatsu, which made it feel like you were flying. They also had one of the biggest roller coasters in the world, Goliath, and one of the fastest, the Superman ride. If you are near to the park and like roller coasters, this is a must go. There is nothing else near as good in America.",Davidsmartreview
30,CROWDED,If you dont buy a fast pass dont go. The lines were more than 2 hours long and even if you do buy a fast pass it doesn't apply to the most popular rides.,MagicAndrew
50,Surpassed expectations,"I had heard that there were concerns about crime and safety with this park recently but after having visited, this concerns were unfounded. We had a spectacular time and felt very safe in the park. The rides were phenomenal. Since I hadn't been here for at least 10 years and my son had never been, we splurged and bought the platinum fast pass since we visited on a Saturday during the summer and didn't want to wait in lines. We rode 20 times and only once did we utilize the back to back feature of the platinum pass. The nice trick is that after they scan your device allowing you into the ride you reserve the next ride so that as soon as you finish you can go ride the next coaster. We did have complications in that ours stopped working while at superman so we had to walk back across the park to get a new one but other thank that, flawless. Tip is that if you buy the extra pass for x2 or full throttle, look at the line before using your special pass. We saw the line for X2 was short so opted to stand in the regular line for 30 minutes and had our fast pass reservation as well. We finished our regular ride and then we were able to use our fast pass for almost a back to back ride on the best coaster in the park. Be prepared for jealous looks as you sprint past all of the people in line that didn't purchase the pass. This park was fantastic.",Jim Gress
50,Fantastic For Teens,"The amazing roller coasters kept my teens busy all day. There isn't much for smaller children but it is a super day out for older ones. I dropped my teens off and picked them up 8 hours later. They'd had a wonderful time, met interesting people and were totally exhausted. Perfect.",snowleopard112358

40,Fun but not free,"Six Flags Magic Mountain is a great place to go for those seeking thrill coasters and great fun. But don't let the reasonable season pass price fool you, in a group of 4 it is nearly impossible to get out of there for under 70 dollars, and that's without buying any shirts or extra cost rides. All in all it is a great park, But maybe pack a lunch instead of buying an overpriced meal.",Jesse N

50,SO MUCH FUN!!,"If you are looking for a place to share lots of laughs, screams, and an all around great experience with your family, friends, or significant other..Six Flags Magic Mountain is the place to go! I went on a Monday in mid July and got to go on every ride I wanted..even some twice! I played some games and no one walks away without a prize which is nice! Food is a little pricy but was still satisfying and you can usually get a deal if you have four or more in your party. The rides range for all ages and all thrill levels, but let me tell you..the Highest thrill rides are CRAZY FUN! (*if you like that adrenaline rush kind of thing;) ) I never had to wait more than 25 maybe 30 minutes in a line which was awesome! I advise you go on a weekday in the summer (Tuesday-Thursday is even less crowded) for the best experience! This is the best place for a fun day trip or weekend trip, depending where you are from, and I highlyyyyy recommend venturing out to Ventura to make a fantastic and enjoyable memory with your friends and family(:",kayhayz
30,Due a face lift,"This was my third visit in to six flags. Upon entry to the park I noticed it looked tired and could do with some form of face lift. It has been three years since my last visit, and after seeing other parks across the USA it was noticeable that six flags is looking old. Rides are still as good, but was surprised at the change to the ride superman and now you start backwards. If asked would I go again, we'll not in near the future.",lowieEngland
40,Many improvements have been made,It has been almost 20 years since I have been to Magic Mountain. The last time I went was as a young adult and it was not a good experience. It was crowded with long waits in line and a few times there were people that made me nervous for my safety. This time I went as a mother of 3 and our whole family had a fun time. We went on a Monday in summer and it was not crowded. The older kids went on almost all the rides with not much more than a 30 min wait and many rides you could just walk on. There was quite a bit for the 4 year old to do and that kept her interested. We stayed most of the day and we all had a fun time.,snulie
40,Fun Theme Park,Six Flags is a fun them park to visit. They have plenty to do for all ages. The thrill rides are amazing.,Kimberlee B
40,Great park - full of coasters,"This was the third time I have visited this park and the rides didn't disappoint. The only thing I would say is that I believe that the park is in need of an update now. Walking around the park I noticed that generally the park has not been well maintained, e.g. Could do with a lick of paint. This made the park look tired and unkept. It does have some great coasters but I do think that some money needs to be spent to make the park look spectacular again.",mbl0we
50,Fun exciting adrenaline rushes,"Great rides,, fantastic day out if you like roller coasters, queues no issues, some were less than 10 minutes, in demand rides just meant coming back later in the day. We had a family visit with three late teen children and all had a blast! Quality of food could have been better but typical of all theme parks.",Woodyinnz
50,Six Flags are the Greatest!,"We have season passes that are honored all the Six Flags in country so that's a great plus. Magic Mountain is the original Six Flags venture that started it all. It is like all the Six Flags with great rollercoasters, only it has an ""older amusement park feel"" to it with new rides included. We went the next day after an accident with the Ninja ride, so the park was pretty empty. A good time to get on every ride right away with no lines. We even were able to go right back on some of the same rides. The Collosus is an ""old school"" wood rollercoaster that is ending soon, so worth going on before it closes soon for the nostalgic rollercoasterer. Not that thrilling now in this day and age of smooth super fast coasters. Goliath is one of my favorites here with a 255 ft drop and speed up to 85 mph! Batman Ride is similar to the one in New Jersey and always fun along with the Apocolypse that drops 95 feet. Green Lantern is great with numerous 360 degree flips and speed to match and Roaring Rapids is a fun rapids thriller also similar to the Six Flags ride in New Jersey where you get wet for sure especially if your sitting on the heavy side of the raft. The other coasters like Scream, Riddlers Revenge, Viper and Tatsu are also great fun and you won't be disappointed. Food is ok but expensive, as expected at most amusement parks. Best deal is to buy the drink cup that you can get free refills all day. It's worth it. Lot's of shaded areas and misters there to help battle the heat of that area in Valencia. Buy your parking online. It's cheaper and quicker. There are plenty of places to eat when you leave the park around there, so that's an option if you've had it with park food. This Six Flags won't disappoint you at all if you like coasters and is great family and friend fun!",GeeBen1
30,Fantastic for roller coaster lovers.,"I took my teenage boys to magic mountain. They have previously been to Thorpe Park and this place blew their minds. However, the rides are so, so much larger than anything they have been on before and it was actually too much for my eldest son, within 3 rides he was feeling very sick! We had read that it was good to get the fast track passes and we did. We got them the platinum one which was a huge amount of money and i can't see that it was that much better than the gold. It was difficult to understand the whole fast track system initially and so be patient! Once up and running it was fantastic how the queues were reduced by 90%. A few negative points were that it was absolutely baking. There was little shade and drinks were about $5 each. Also there was a constant smell of sick which wasn't great plus large queues for lunch (although neither of my boys wanted to eat after the rides!) As a parent who was just waiting around it was a long and hot day (although if they are old enough you could leave them and spend the day in the water park area, which we will do next time if i have to go back!) My sons loved it though.",Dani P

50,Tons of Roller Coasters,"Six Flags Magic Mountain cannot be beat on thrilling roller coasters. The park has some of the most unbelievable rides imaginable from Lex Luther, the massive drop ride, to X2, a must-see-it-to-believe-it 4th dimensional rollercoaster, there is something that will thrill even the hardiest adrenaline junky.",Joel B
50,Wow!,"Half of our family are massive roller coaster enthusiasts and went to six flags for the day. The other half went shopping. For non roller coaster enthusiasts, don't bother. For us coaster nuts, this place deserves it's billing as the best Coaster Park in America. Crazy good. A few things; you need the platimum pass or you won't get all of the coasters done. Otherwise you will need to plan and pick. I don't know how you would go about doing that as all of the coasters are exceptional. I have no idea how to rank them? X2? Goliath? Batman? Superman? etc etc etc.. Unreal. The park with the pass is expensive but for us it was a once in a life time experience. We got 18 rides in with the platinum pass in one day and a few of the rides we rode twice. No chance without the platinum pass. Fantastic day. Bucket list item covered.",hulstonfive
50,Wish We Lived Closer!!,"We had a blast here! Grant it, some of the lines were extremely long, but the rides were well worth the wait. The staff securing everyone onto the rides were very friendly. The only thing I would change would be to lower the pricing on your food and beverages as the entry cost into the park is relatively high. You can still make a profit, but to charge $4 for a bottled water that costs .99 in stores is a little ridiculous. I'm not complaining (maybe a little) and understand it is what it is, but it would be nice to see lower prices. Overall, it was a fantastic experience and cannot wait to return!",tomandbrandy

40,Lots of Rides but Flash Pass highly recommended,"Magic mountain is great. If you go in the off season, there isn't a ton of people, and it's easy to get on and off the rides without much of a wait. This review is based on the busy season I attended on a Saturday in July.We went about noon with plans of getting a flash pass to skip the huge crowds already formed around the rides. I was informed the passes had already been sold out and we would have to tough it out in line. The 8 hours I was there, we rode 5 rides due to the huge lines. I highly recommend getting a flash pass a few days early online.Navigating the park takes some work. There are steep hills, long stretches, and I would not recommend for the elderly or disabled. If you do not/are not able to get a flash pass, plan ahead and pick 4 or 5 rides you really want to ride. Stick to those and tough out the lines that can take up to 2 hours.Some of the smaller/older rides tend to have shorter lines if you're looking for quantity over quality.",Edward Y
40,Great roller coaster adventure,"Lots of heart-pumping rollercoasters. However, long lines during the weekend, so go on Mon-Fri if you can. Go 30 mins earlier than opening and get on the busy rides .. ie. X2, Full Throttle, and Tatsu first. Bring in water but not much because vendors open at 11am and you can do free refills. Use bathrooms in the morning because they get yucky later in the day. What bugs me is that Magic Mtn obviously gets good revenue but of all the amusement parks my family has visited, they have the most out-dated and dirtiest bathrooms around. They need to have a bathroom cleaning crew throughout the day that just goes around the bathrooms to clean up; I never saw anyone checking/cleaning the bathrooms during the day.Food is good but expensive, which is expected. If you are on a special diet, they will allow food to be brought in.Ladies - wear appropriate walking shoes! This park is hilly!Dippin Dots - if you like this but are turned off with the price, I noticed that the prices are different at different locations. I didn't check all the DD locations, but the cheapest I found was by Tatsu, so get it there.DiscoverCard/GoldPass: Use them! Very helpful to get in earlier and w discover card, you get a 5% rebate. REMEMBER to register for this rebate with DiscoverCard; otherwise, you will not get the 5% rebate. You can always try to ask DiscoverCard to honor older purchases; they usu. are good with this.FannyPack: So helpful. Get one and use it. Backpacks may be required at some rides to be put in a locker ... another expense you may not want.",74giselab
50,"Wonderful day, despite crowds","Even though the park was extremely crowded (since it was a summer weekend), I was able to get on 15 rides. The lines moved pretty quickly (especially the single rider lines), and the atmosphere was very fun and family-friendly.",Ryan O
50,Awesome family time,We took our sons and friends and had a great time! We stayed at the hotel very close to the park so we could rest well before driving home.,Melissa G
30,"Good rides, filthy","This is a no frills roller coaster park. We visited on a Friday and the lines were almost non-existent. We were both very glad we didn't buy the flex pass, we walked on to everything. The rides were really good, but I found many if them too jerky for my liking. I don't live having my head bashed on the head rest repeatedly and there were many rides that did just that. The riddler ride was the single most uncomfortable coaster I have ever ridden in my life, we joked the rest of the day that we were deeply violated by a ride. I don't understand how men could ride that, I was sore afterwards. On the flip side the superman ride was fantastic along with the batman coaster. The entire park was absolutely filthy. We got there an hour after opening and there was already garbage cans overflowing and you had to be careful when you sat down that you weren't sitting I a mysterious crusty mess. The superman queue had the biggest dust bunny I've ever see and there were pistachio shells everywhere. Many features in the queues were not functioning. There were a lot of TV sets off. All that said, I do plan on returning, there were enough good coasters at that price to overlook the problems.",Thezue
30,Busy day,"Huge day was ok but a lot of walking up hills. No good if your elderly, disabled etc. A lot of the rides were closed although we had already pre purchased the flash pass (Platinum), which was a good move but did not include all rides which was a disappointment.",Ninny R
50,Awesome gold pass member!,The park members are very welcoming. The park and restrooms are very clean. Overall this is a great buy. As a gold member we get to go to both six flags and hurricane harbor and it's just been incredibly pleasant and entertaining.,Yovi F
50,Awesome,"Ordered our tickets online prior to our visit. We ordered a parking ticket, admissions as well as a FlashPass Gold.Went on a Monday in July and arrived just after the park opened at 10:30. The parking area is huge and a bus took us right to the entrance. Very convenient.After entering the park we went to pick up our FlashPass which turned out to be an electronic gadget where you can see the current waiting time for most rides and you can then book a time for the desired ride. When your time is up, the gadget shakes and you can then go directly to your ride (mostly via the ride's exit). Allthough the FlashPass is expensive it turned out to be a very good investment as we skipped all the long lines and only waited 1-5 minutes at each ride. You can only book one ride at a time!In general I think going on a Monday was a good idea as the park was not packed at all. Prior to our stay we went to Six Flags website and read about their rides and when we were in the park it was easy to remember the individual rides when reading the park map (you can get it by the entrance).We spent 6 hours at the park and tried a lot of great and thrilling rides. Please note that there are rides for everybody i.e. it is not only the 'famous' thrill rides that are good.Finally, there is plenty of food selections and vending machines at the park. As other reviewers say it is pricy, but what else can you expect in such a theme park.If you find this review helpful please let me know (below).",Martin A
40,Magic Mountain - grandkids fun!,"Got there when it opened (be ready for $20 parking fee) and left right before it closed. Very little wait for rides, longest line was for funnel cake.Gonna make it a yearly tradition to bond.",Sunshine K
30,Adventure but long lines,"There are awesome rides like viper and 2X, but not enough information for newcomers. It takes time to understand the system, Fast track policy. We spent a lot time in the lines. We could not find how the fast track system worked",Earibal
50,Go Big or Go Home,"If you like super big rides, this is your place. You can get into the theme of the park by purchasing an inexpensive Superhero Cape. Lots of guests wear them and it adds to the Fun! Who doesn't like being a Superhero! Only negative was cleanliness of bathrooms, Yikes! Bring hand sanitizer.",K12P
20,Incompetent parking staff,"I went there with my daughter and her friend for my company picnic. Getting through the parking booth was simply frustrating. The people working the parking booth are incompetent and arrogant. There were one lane that was open and cars started moving to that lane so I moved there also. By the time I got to the ticket booth, the jerk there refused to let me drive through that lane ( I have no idea why). I ended up have to force my way to the adjacent lane. If the lane I was in was closed, there should be clear sign to indicate that. But no, he let all the cars in front of me passed but not me. Fortunately, the rest of the day was uneventful and my daughter and her friend had a great time.Tips I have:1. If you want to ride with shorter lines (flash pass, yeah, I know. But if you don't want to pay extra), stay until closing time. A lot of people leaves around 6-7pm.2. If you are like me who go there not for the ride but as a chaperon of teenagers and want somewhere to sit that's air conditioned, ""Food etc"" next to Goliah is the place to be.",bettywhill
50,great bang for your buck!,If you want a great time for moderate money then look no further than Six Flags. Great place to go. I spent the extra $10.00 and got a seasons pass ($69.99 regular day pass/ $79.99 season pass) so we could go for two days. The park is quite big so there was no pushing or shoving found at the other parks. But be prepared to wait in line for the better and newer roller coasters.,Karen G
50,Flash pass;),The flash pass is awesome!!--Well worth the extra money you pay. No long lines or long waiting times. I will definitely go this route next time.,Christine H
50,six flags magic mtn in los angelas,10+for everything magic mtn has to offer its amazing the rides were superb i live tatsu drop of doom wasnt that scarry no biggie superman is nuts x2 is off the hook we loved went on weekday and got on every ride without waiting it was so hot but they have aircooling in bathrooms and restaurants and couple of wet rides to cool off besides the mists,Mimi H
50,Buy tickets and parking pass online in advance,Loads of fun at the park. Great rides and since it wasnt too busy many rides we didnt have to wait too long. We also purchased our parking pass and admission tickets online before leaving home. This sped up the process getting in. Also arrive early and leave a bit early to avoid crowds and get a good parking spot.I would agree that Tatsu and X2 are probably the best rides so far. Tatsu is a bit challenging at the end when you hang as if youre lying on your stomach waiting for the group ahead of you to unload and load.All in all a great time with the kids. They seemed to enjoy themselves very much.,phinfall
50,Much improved!,"Six Flags has put some serious effort into revamping Magic Mountain, it's scenery, and attractions at over the past few years, and this year has seen the largest improvement yet! They've repainted, remodeled, and added high tech new rides, more variety of their street performers and shows, as well a interactive character . They've also added a tremendous variety to their food options, including healthier options even on the season dining pass. Way to go, six flags!",Medievallass
40,Good for families with teenagers,"We got the season passes this year so we could visit all year. I have 2 kids ages 13 and 16 and both love the park. It has big roller coasters they both enjoy. I typically don't ride because I don't enjoy the roughness of some of the rides. I did like the Superman ride and Lex Luther ride however. The food is expensive for what it is so we go out of the park for lunch during the hot part of the day and relax. We came Tue through Thur and it wasn't as busy as last year. The restrooms were kinda yucky, but the people using them were being inconsiderate of the other people that need them and the employees that have to clean up after them. I wish it was open later than 9 so we could ride longer without the heat of the day.",bessiemount
50,Best summer trip ever for are 2014 summer. I would love going again.,"Do go early for parking, Buy the souvenir cups for free re-fills where tennies shoes for a long walking. The food is great. And my kids love the rides. And for Adult it really cool for the big rides. Plus it close to Denny's so before you go to Six flag stop by for Breakfast.",Cynthia A
50,Magic Mountain - Go on a Weekday!,"Great experience and lots of fun. make sure you ride the Tatsu and X2. Wear tennis shoes, lots of hills but great exercise. Lines are way shorter during weekdays.",Candy B
50,Great Time!,We had a great day. The rides are excellent. Make sure you ride X2 no matter how long you have to wait in line. The food and drinks are $$$$. But you expect that from an amusement park. I did purchase the platinum passes for a $100ea and we didn't wait to long in line and we got to ride most rides twice. I recommend some kind of flash pass to get through the line faster. They do have 3 different types available. I think I'll be going back in August to do it all over again.,Kevin H
50,Best roller coasters on the west coast,"The first coaster closest to the entrance was rather bland, but the one next to it had a couple of loops and corkscrews that really got me excited. The rest was epic, especially the X2. Except The Ninja is not worth the hike - skip it.",Jason N
50,SO MUCH FUN!,"Better than Disneyland! So many rides, we stayed 2 days. Very reasonable pricing. And the people are so nice.",cooper_caryn
50,Where have I been?!?!?!,"From the UK, an Amusement Park of this size is any boys dream and did not dissapoint.We entered the park at opening and collected our fast track unit. We chose the highest of levels meaning it cut out most of the wait and got us two rides excluding a few busy rides. The flash pass was great, it showed us we had time to do everything and relax at the same time (a big relief for us) and made our day enjoyable as we got on everything. A little side note to people thinking of this, the platinum level still does not include Full Throttle and/or X2 but they can be bought for $15 per person.The park itself was fairly clean but a notable area was the collection of Gum at the end of the Green Lantern ride which was not nice.The rides themselves need a bit more description.(In order we went on)Viper: A good ride till the twovloops are done. From then on, this ride rattles so badly that you wish you hadn't gone one. 3/10Revolution: A great ride considering it was the worlds first looping coaster. Very smooth and has great drops and turns. 7/10Tatsu: A ride which makes you seem to fly and makes a great experience with sharp turns and a massive loop making it truly Amazing. 8/10Apocalypse: A big, fast and surprisingly comfortable wooden coaster which uses sharp drops and tunnels to make it great. But loading was very slow. 6/10The Riddler: Yep, what people say is true, it it not a nice experience for it is a very rattly ride while you are standing up making it a bad experience. 4/10Batman: A great inverted coaster with lots of sharp turns and loops. Its downfall however is the amount of noise that it makes. 6/10Gold Rusher: The parks first rollercoaster is dissapointing as it has a lift hill every five minutes and when it finally picks up speed, it stops. 3/10Green Lantern: The ride is good as you really feel like you are being pulled in and out of your seats. However, the fun ended abruptly as the last bit, upside down, made it painful on your legs. 2/10Scream!: A great thrilling ride with some great staff and surprising smooth for a floorless coaster. 8/10Colossus: It made our day complete and it is a shame to see it go. The steep drops and smooth turns make it great and it was smooth compared to Apocalypse. A must do before 16/8/14. 10/10Goliath: Well, the tight turns with high G's combined with massive drops and smooth turns. This rode is a must do thrill. 10/10Superman: A fast thrilling ride but its over too quickly and is too loud. 8/10The park is great and only has needs a few tweaks.(I) They don't do decaf in all the shops selling Coffee/Tea(II) The food is high priced in some places and low priced in othersApart from these downsides, there are many upsides:(I) Buying three unlimited drinks is cheaper than buying two drinks?(II) The park is well spaced out meaning no rides are bunched up.(III) The park is very Family friendlyA great park overall and I look forward to going back some time",Al_Ten_Ten
50,Well worth a return visit,"Grandma, Daughter, 12 year-old granddaughter and 6 year-old granddaughter, all found something to enjoy at this park. We came last year and loved it so planned a vacation around it again this year. The new coaster, Full Throttle, made the trip back well worth the trip - that is if you like roller coasters! We also had to ride Colossus one more time since it is being replaced after this season. My husband worked on building this one before we moved to Nevada and it has a special place in our lives. It was just as much fun this time as it was the first time. It was hot and humid, but that is to be expected. We purchased our tickets on line ahead of time and saved $100. Also got the free-refillable drink cups and saved a whole bunch as we each easily drank a half dozen refills. The lines weren't too long, the kiddie's rides are excellent, and the array of coasters is challenging! Going back next year!",Charlayne C
50,"Great day out, would come again !","Great day out, rides are pretty cool! Didn't get to go on the x2, we got into the park (Friday) as soon as gates opened, and went straight to the x2, but queued for nearly an hour and was still some time away from getting on the ride... Busting for a pee, so we left :(Did all the other rides, great fun, went on that Ninja twice towards end of day as queues had gone by 7pm...I would come here again, oh yes.",Stuie-UK
50,Excellent but pricy in the park,"We spent a day here on 15th July and had a great day. The park has some excellent coasters and all bar one were open. The park is also very spread out so lots of walking required. We did all the big rides but only managed it because we bought Platinum passes at $100 extra each. This allowed you to book on rides from a hand held gadget that you carried around so no queue waiting. It also allows you to stay on some rides and ride twice. Whilst this seems a good idea, you do get (justified) evil stares from those waiting in line. It covers all but 2 of the biggest rides and you could purchase passes for these at an additional $15 each . . . Totally NOT worth it. Just buy platinum and rides these 2 first. Drinks and food are mega expensive approx $3.50 for a coke or water bottle and no food or drink can be bought in. Overall a great day out just don't eat or drink too much or you will need to bring a fat wallet. Not too busy on a Tuesday but there was no way we would have managed to do it all without a fast pass.",FOXYSKI

50,4 days at Magic Mountain,"We spent 4 days at the park, 2 nights had special ride events which were ""bonus fun"". Park is clean, rides are well run. We recommend you come early, and retreat to your hotel pool from around 2-5pm. Then return for cooler weather, shorter lines and refreshed kids! Riding the rides after dark, with city and park lights is really fantastic.",Jacqueline K
50,Great fun day out!,"Magic Mountain was well worth the trip out from LA. The park is huge and had a great variety of roller coasters to ride.We were only in LA for a few days so would definitely recommend the Platinum Flash Pass. Yes it's expensive, but it allowed us to try all of the rides without waiting more than few minutes. We never would have been able to ride them all in a day without it, and managed to avoid lining up in the sun for hours! If you're visiting and staying in LA I would recommend hiring a car for the day as public transport would take forever.Overall the park is great with a huge variety of roller coasters - highly recommended!",Spanner82
50,Great day with family and friends,It was fun we thought of getting flash passes since it was a lot of us but we didn't was fun standing in line playing games and hearing the street performers,Giovanny G
20,Some great rides but over all a let down.,"This park was a bit of a let down. We visit another coaster park in the mid-west (cedar point) about once a year.The good:A great number of coasters to enjoy some that are innovative and are unlike other coaster I have been seen before.Tatsu: a fun coaster that gives you the feeling of hang gliding.X2: a coaster that has seats outside the track that tilt based on where you are on the track giving you a very fun ride.Green lantern: unusual track design and car system that I was excited to tryYou can get discounted tickets online if you purchase at least one day in advance. we purchased our tickets at 11:45pm the day before we went and saved $20 per ticket. if we would have waited til after midnight we would have had to purchase full price tickets at the gate.The bad:Magic Mountain has a few coasters that are very much like the coasters at Cedar Point however at Magic Mountain they were at most half the length of the like coaster at Cedar PointThe park layout was strange and there were a lot of dead ends on path ways.The exit paths from the rides were often long in some cases the exit took longer then waiting in line.The lines are organized however the operators are not as an example after waiting about 45 min for X2 and getting up to the loading platform most of the trains we saw leave only half full. Many of the rides we saw on this day had the same kind of strange lines.The loading and unloading of the coasters takes forever. Some of the coasters had count down clocks that started at 1 min, the countdown started when the car stopped and people could get off the ride to make room for the new riders. The I assume goal time of 1 min was missed on every line I was in and in most cases it took double the time or more to unload and load the train again. in one case on the superman ride it took over 10 min to load a car. (At Cedar Point in OH the loading and unloading takes less then a min every time.Most of the ride operators had almost no personality, and often just sat there talking to each other instead of focusing on getting customers on the ride and going.Green Lantern was closed. Had to miss out on this attraction which was one of the three coasters we went to this park for.I would not return to Six flags Magic Mountain on a future trip to ca if I was looking for a coaster based amusement park in southern CA I would choose Knotts berry farm. tho it has been a few years since I have been there. So I cannot review that park",Zawers
40,"Had a great, fun-filled day.","I scoured the Internet for the best deal on coupons and used my Discover card to skip lines and get more cash back, so we were already off to a good start. Although we went on a hot, clear-skied Sunday, the lines were all very reasonable minus the water ride where you sit in a lazy donut-type thing with strangers. That was too long and not worth the wait.Since I read ahead about ridiculously overpriced food, I stuck to the bare minimum of fruit and water to keep me going but not weighed down with junk and tok nauseous/angry about being ripped off at the concession stands.We stayed for hours and enjoyed everything. Definitely worth the trip, money, and time. The staff were all chatty and personable as well, which added to the happy atmosphere.",RollingStoneRolling

40,"Fun, but disappointing","We were there when they opened and dispite of a lot of people it didn't seem like it when we entered the park. We had great fun on se eral rollercoasters and the kids loved driving the cars.(extra cost) what was disappointing was that several rides were closed and it was not announced anywhere. We paid full price, but 7 rides where closed and that is a lot.The staff is very nice and helpful and the food was good.",Fetsund_NorwayGry
40,All about the coasters,"this isn't Disneyland with some stupid stuffed animals wanting a photo with you and grandma. This is about speed and g forces.The park is so large with so many coasters that even with the Gold Flash Pass you might not get through them all.As with most parks like this they sting you for extra cash at every turn. $4.25 for 1lt of Dasani water (which is filtered tap water). The flash pass is an absolute must but can easily double you park ticket cost.Would I go again? Yes. Would I recommend it, yes and over the other LA attractions if you're about the coasters.",lbizarre
40,"Not for the faint of heart, Do NOT come in summer if you can help it!!","My daughter and 6 of her friends came here for her 16th birthday at the beginning of June. We went on a Sunday, which turned out to be a great day to come, lots of time to hit as many rides as we could, however my husband and I realized how old we truly are.Did it always hurt this bad to have your brain rattled in your brain? I realize my threshold for ""pain"" has significantly decreased. I will leave the rides to the teens and thrill seekers who can actually hack it.One MAJOR piece of advice though is if you can come during the school year, please do so. It will be so worth your money to avoid the crowds. We were NOT waiting in long lines that wound endlessly in 90 plus degree weather. It can get very hot in Valencia and 1 month later and these So Cal locals would even have been complaining.It is worth it to skip a week of school and come when no one is there. Trust me, your kids WILL make up the work and not flunk out, but your wallet and patience will not be stretched thin if you come in September, October, April or May.Enjoy and wave to your kids from the sidelines if you need to, trust me the rest of the day and your brain will thank you.",Urbanhick
40,Great thrill park but could use more moderate rides,"Wilson and I visited this park 5 days in a row from Monday night June 23-27. Lucy and Ansley came the mornings of Tuesday & Wednesday. It's a great park if you love roller coasters. From best to worst my list would be: Tatsu, Full Throttle, X2, Goliath, Superman, Apocalypse, Revolution, Ninja, Green Lantern, Colossus, Scream, Batman, Gold Rusher, Viper, and last Riddler's Revenge. Luther's drop is awesome! They have a good variety of food for a six flags park. I liked the fish and chips next to Goliath. They have 2 coke freestyle stations, but often times many flavors were out. Apocalypse is far away from other park attractions and only one train was running which was frustrating. We ate the chocolate devotion ice cream from the cold stone 4 days in a row- it was delicious!",Packerfancheesehead
50,What a blast!,"I must say, I am 47 years old and I enjoyed myself at Magic Mountain. I took a my children along with a group of their friends. Magic Mountain was cost friendly. We visited the park on a Wednesday, and I must say that the park wasn't crowded at all, the ease and access to all the rides were remarkable, we didn't wait no longer than 30 minutes for any ride and at a few of the attractions, we were able to get right back on the rides if we like. The cost of the food was very reasonable and staff were friendly...",Phyllis H

50,Magic Mountain is still fun after so many years,If you go to Magic Mountain you have to try Full Throttle and Tatsu. The Luthor Drop is crazy. We had so much fun. It was like being a kid again.,J M
40,"Great roller-coasters, decent day out!","While Six Flags doesn't quite have the all encompassing feel of Disney Land or Legoland, the roller coasters here make it well worth the visit.A group of 7 of us spent the whole day here, from opening right to close, and managed to ride nearly all the major attractions. We rode Colossus (it's closing August 2014) which was quite an experience, very cool to see what roller-coasters were like in the '70s!There are a good number of rides that would be suitable for children/younger teens, as well as a few that will thrill anyone. X2 is a pretty spectacular concept for a roller-coaster - I've never been on anything quite like it before!We went during the week, so the lines were not too long, and we didn't need to buy Flash-passes, but I would not rule this out if you go during the weekend, especially during a school holiday.Overall a very good theme park - one complaint we had was the lack of food choices, almost all the restaurants away from the main 'street' were just standard fried-chicken/burger fare, but this will be fine for most. Other choices are available, just not in all parts of the park. Most definitely worth a visit if you like coasters, and we all thought the entry price was very reasonable (we bought tickets at the gate on the day).",Andrew Mills
20,Losing its magic ...,"Just as it's Goliath drop, Six Flags Magic Mountain may drop its magic in a hard way unless they re-imagine its THEME.Yeah, it is a THEME PARK ! Thrill is not a theme people can relate too. Franchise is. Six Flags Magic Mountain is failing to invest and exploit the Warner Bros and DC Comics franchise the way Disney and Universal do with theirs. The visitors are thrilled to see the characters and the atmospheres, not just drops and twists of the attraction. The visitors need to be inside the world of the characters.Unless, Six Flags seriously considering putting up huge re-positioning of its place in the world of imagination, these rails and tracks are going to rust quicker than the gravity.",DickyTjokrosaputro
20,bad day in magic mountain and huracane harbor,The magic mountains is ok like if you buy flash pass there are no waiting at all but when we went to huricane harbor there we couldent go to any slides without waiting because we didnt buy flash pass and you needed to pay about 15$ to rent an inflatable circle. And I would never go there again. p.s The rides are cool but the organization is rubish.,Семен Р

The only thing I disliked is that the sky tower was closed. I wanted to get pictures from there.If you are traveling to more than one six flags park it's best to purchase a six flags GOLD PASS.That is good for admission and parking at all six flags parks.

Some of the major roller coasters had long lines (20 min to 40 mins) but all the other lines were short or non-existent. The medium roller coasters are also good. We enjoyed the magic show a lot, the performers were great (an ""America Got Talent"" winner) and it was a good break from the heat. Are kids ages were 11, 11, and 13.",Thomas C

Tatsu was a personal favourite of mine, would highly recommend visiting the park if in the area.We were lucky as well in that the longest queue of the day was only 30-45 minutes for the rapids.

We were in the park for about 9 hours and rode all of the big rides (X2, Tatsu, Full Throttle, Viper, Ninja, Colossus, Batman, Green Lantern, Superman, Lex Luthor & more). We literally just made a loop around the park and got on whatever ride was next on the map. Remember to wear comfy shoes. Girls and hubby gave out before Mom was ready to go, but when the park closes, you kind of have to go too! Bought our tickets 5 days in advance online and got a decent deal. Would definitely consider visiting again-especially on a holiday.",247busymom
50,AMAZING,Wow the rides are incredible. Loved Tatsu a real sensory overload. Recommend the flash pass as some queues for rides were 90 minutes and we waited around 10 minutes with that pass. Can't wait to try other six flags parks when we visit the USA again.,Rhys M
50,"Good time, good vibes","Great park to enjoy as a couple and as a family, I went with my boyfriend his best friend and my best friend along with my mother and sisters we all had a grand time.",BlancaZ33
50,Is everybody in?,"Best park ever.yea your gonna be dealing with broken down rides often but it's for your own safety. Usually if it's not running that day it will be running the next day. For example x2 AND tatsu were closed on Thursday but were up and running on Saturday. The park is clean and the staff are kinda unhelpful but really that's every amusement park. The only real complaint I have is that x2 speakers kinda crapped out. No chain hill music only the ""is everybody in?"" In the station and the other train had nothing.also no fire, fog. But in the end it was still 100% worth it and I applaud that ride forever .i love tatsu and just everything about magic mountian BUT they should feign tell us when they are doing Maintence in the rides. Don't just shut it down and leave us all surprised when we see"" we are sorry. X2 is closed today"" It has it's ups and downs but if your a coaster person then this is the place. If not just go to Disney and pay 100 dollars for a 1 day ticket.just an fwi a season pass at 6 flags is 100.",Ayeitsjayb
40,06/27/14 Trip,"Buy the Flash Pass! The park and restaurants were very clean. The price of the food is high. We bought the refillable drinks cups for the day, the down side is waiting in line to refill them. The rides were great! The kids and adults really enjoyed the ""big"" rides and did several twice.",Erica Barnhart
40,Great Amusement Park,This was a very clean park. Staff was friendly. Hate that I have to pay for parking even though I already paid for my tickets. Ridiculous. Water and food is expensive too. I suggest taking your own. Also in X2 you have to pay for a locker to store your stuff while you go on the ride which is just stupid. Overall I had a great time.,DEATHSCOPE123 .
50,Best Summer Attraction! must go,Its great for all ages. All family members will have something to enjoy. Even granny will enjoy the several different shows.Very friendly atmosphere.Im not sure if its worth going to without having the flash pass. Makes life so much easier! if you are only visiting for the day you should get it. But if you live in the region then getting the season pass is enough.Enjoy!!,Salem A
50,Best Adventure Park in LA area,"Do not bring pre-bought food but water bottles will be allowed.The rides were fantastic - all different from each other. When we saw the height and difficulty of them, we thought we were going to die, but in fact they were challenging, exhilarating and exciting. All age groups in our family were catered for. Food and drink were expensive but satisfying. Staff were friendly and helpful. Stayed 8 hours, and left wishing we had stamina for more.",RoseSeymour
50,Buy the Flash Pass!,"We waited until our youngest (7 yrs) was old enough, tall enough to go on all but 7 rides. We bought the base Flash Pass on-line, but the line to redeem was so long that by the time my husband got to the counter, he upgraded to the mid-level passes just so we could make up some lost time. Friends of ours also went and did not buy passes, self described as 'too cheap'; but they didn't get to go on nearly as many rides - waiting 1 1/2 hours or more! They'd been in line for the Jet Stream when we caught up to them - we literally passed them, walked onto the ride and exited by the time they were finally getting to get on the ride! The only difference in mid-level pass to top level pass is a wrist band where you can ride the same ride a second time without getting off; but only certain rides! Spent most of day into evening and thanks to the passes got to ride most of the roller coasters. Missing only the ones the kids refused to go on (7 and 11 yrs).",Nicole H
50,Great rides,"I go here for the best rides. Thrills, thrills, and more thrills. Parking traffic can be a pain especially after getting through parts of Los Angeles. Be patient with that. Summers can be warmer than other areas around LA so dress lightly but at least have light jackets in the car or lockers for cooler nights. Typical for the West Coast.",Scottism
50,fun times,We had a great time with our family. The older kids enjoyed the thrill rides while the younger kids enjoyed the kid area. It was a great family time.,collins_family4343
30,Great rides but that's about it!,"The rides are absolutely fantastic and a real experience.However we had our disabled daughter with us who uses a wheelchair. The park has an equal access facility whereby the disabled guest gets a time to return to the exit to avoid having to queue. The attitude of the majority of the staff when applying for the time or showing up at the ride, bordered on many times on downright rude. It appeared to be ok for the assistants to ignore the stipulated time and run over it by up to 20 minutes, but on the occasions we would turn up by no more than 5 minutes early, we were told in no uncertain times that we could not ride until the stipulated time.We have been to Disney and Universal on many occasions before and have never experienced anything like this before. Also toilet facilities for disabled guests throughout the park were absolutely disgusting with all disabled toilets being used by the general public. Again Disney and Universal deal with equivalent or greater footfall and I have never experienced this elsewhere.Come on Six Flags- investment in staff training and facilities and restroom cleanliness is as important as new thrill rides",Desy-W
50,Magic Mountain visit 6/27/14,"Great thrill rides! Number 1) Wear good walking shoes. Your feet and back will thank you. That goes for you too women. Some rides require you to take off your sandals. Number 2) Wear shorts with sealed pockets so you don't lose your keys, creadit cards, cell phone, money, etc because these rides will flip you around. Do not wear jeans because it will make you hot and unconfortable due to all the walking. It's called Magic Mountain for a reason - up and down hill walking. 3) Wear sunscreen. 4) Make sure to get there an hour early so you get good parking. Know when the park opens. Lines form deep to get into the park. 5) Get a Gold Pass and get in 10 minutes before everyone else. It makes a big difference getting in early so you can go straight to your favorite thrill ride like X2 or Tatsu which get busy and have the longest lines. I rode X2 twice before the line started to form and went to Tasu and got on it before lines started to form. Knocked out two rides quicky by getting in early. Really worth it! 6) Food is expensive but it's really good. You may want to pre-puchase food vouchers but I suggest just bringing your credit card. 7) It's hot in the summer afternoons so get all your thrill rides in early otherwise you'll be waiting in hour long lines in hot weather. 8) If you don't like germs then bring sanitizing wipes or do what we do and avoid touching hand rails and wash your hands in a nearby bathroom after riding because everbody touches everything like hand rails in lines and the restraints on the rides. 9) Try to get in as much as you can before the afternoon when it gets busy. 10) Go to the main souveneer shop near the park entrance before you leave. They will have multiple styles of your favorite thrill ride shirts and are reasonably priced. They also sell so much other merchandise so it's worth visiting. Have fun!",Ian H
50,Six Flags Magic Mountain,great place for all ages ! Make sure you wear some comfy shoes ! :D the thrill rides are insanely awesome !,flowerranger
50,Rides are for Teens!,The X2 was amazingly scary and not for the faint at heart. If you ride X2 first the other rides are not as bad. Ninja was more scenic but still an amazing ride. The Apocalypse was a loooooong wait for a not so great ride. A lot of walking but great exercise. Ate charbroiled burgers and it was delicious. Get the souvenir cups for unlimited refills...you will get thirsty. Kids had fun with the game concessions near Riddler and Batman rides. Go for the car rides because they make you take so many laps even though the speed is limited. Bathrooms are reasonably clean. Loved the water rafting ride (you will get wet). Didn't really need the flash pass. Parking shuttles should be more frequent and accessible.,Family671
40,Thrill rides: perfect park for Teenagers,"Went with my 4 nephews on a Sunday at the end of June. Weather in the morning was good, weather after 5 was good, HOT during the middle of the day. Overall a good experience. food is pricey but nothing outrageous for a theme park.go do full throttle and X2 when the park opens, first thing.buy a flash pass if you want to ride and not stand in lines. $40 per person and it was well worth it. its a beeper thing that will hold a place in line for you basically. they have two higher priced levels at 60$ and 100$, but I'm not sure if they are worth it. $40 basic flash pass definitely was.go ahead and purchase valet parking. its only ten bucks more online and at the end of the day you will be thankful you did. I sure was.eat at foods etc. its cafeteria style and AIR CONDITIONED. no other restaurant is. the extra price is worth the break from the heat.5 people drained one of the sports bottle pretty quick, bring a couple of empty drink bottles and use the sports bottle to fill those up. the sports bottle was $16 with infinite refills for that day.talking with park regulars Superman and Ninja were notorious for break downs. the flash pass will let you know when rides are available and when they just reopened.scream, ninja, and revolution were all good rides with short lines.downsides: break downs on superman, ninja, AND worst of all the little tram train hillclimber Orient Express that takes you to the top of the hill Tetsu, Ninja, and superman are all on. be ready for lots of hills. overall really good. staff was great, helpful and polite.upsides: ticket and basic flashpass together was still cheaper than disneyland",jason d

40,"Loads of fun, but also loads of trash..","Six Flags Magic Mountain is definitely worth your time if you enjoy a good adrenaline rush and don't mind waiting in lines. I visited the park at the end of June (during prime summer vacation season) and the longest line I had to wait in was just over an hour and a half (for Tatsu, so absolutely worth it!).The best rides are Tatsu, X2, and Goliath.Don't expect the park to be as clean as other prominent amusement parks in the LA area, but do expect to have a great time on some truly amazing roller coasters!",TrustVictoria
30,"Keith Gilabert, ""Magic Mountain is not the same without Colossus""","Rides overall are a lot of fun. But the park does not feel the same with Colossus coming to an end. What makes the park so great is riding on the massive wooden roller coaster that shakes and rattles.On the bright side, the rides are a lot of fun especially with the addition of riding Batman and Colossus backwards, which was only available during Halloween but you can ride them now until the closure of Colossus in August.The park overall is clean but the food is really expensive. I like to think of Magic Mountain like a carnival on steroids.",KeithG121217

Wear comfortable shoes,sun block, do not carry any valuables because on this rides you will have to put ur back pack in a locker every time. *If your smart you could bring a back pack and occasionally go to the locker for snacks or pay for each locker which is 1.oo on certain rides.Arrive early if its your first time so that your able to ride as many rides as possible, if your lucky!",Liz C

50,Rides Keep Getting Better!,"My new favorite roller coaster is Full Throttle! It is sooooo smooth and exciting. There is a little surprise during the ride that will thrill you! We enjoyed the park making sure to ride Colossus one last time before they close it in August of 2014. We got to the gates at 10:15am (they open at 10:30) and stayed until 10:30pm. They say they close at 9:00, but they don't close the rides until all the people that were in the line before 9pm have ridden it. So if you are in line at 9:00, they'll still let you ride and they don't close the shops and area near the exit until everyone is done. You can't leave without getting a funnel cake! I recommend NOT waiting until the end of the day because the line is REALLY long then. Try one mid-day!",zoofamily
20,Quit Overselling The Flash Passes!,"We have been season pass holders for a number of years even though we live in Arizona. We love huge, scary roller coasters, and magic mountain has the best in the west. Magic mountain has changed their business model over the last few years which has severely hurt our enjoyment of the park. We used to be able to go to the park, spend the extra money for their platinum flash pass and ride everything we wanted multiple times. This last trip trying to do the same thing was a nightmare. Obviously, they now discount and basically let everyone in for free, but push the flash passes. This has led to everyone having flash pass and making them virtually worthless. The line to get a flash pass was over an hour long when in the past it was a few minutes. Then you make your reservation, get to the ride and are in line with a ton of other people with flash passes around their neck. Everyone expecting to get on the ride soon. This led to ugly lines and even security issues when we were there. We left the park in disgust in mid afternoon. It will be a long time before we ever go back.",AZJuliasDad
30,"Roller coasters are great; getting to them, not so much","We came across the country in part to go to this amusement park, as our 12-year-old is a roller coaster fanatic. Tatsu is the scariest coaster out of 60 I have ridden, comparing to rides at Cedar Point, Six Flags Over Georgia, Carowinds, King's Dominion, and Dollywood. Full Throttle was pretty amazing, too.That said, be prepared for slow, long lines in the season pass area, Flash Pass area, and even to get through the turnstiles at the gate. And when you get to the counters and the gate, you are greeted with 'tude from the employees. Compared to the above parks, crowd management at Six Flags MM was very sub-par. The food is the usual level of highway robbery and mediocrity, but you aren't there for a gourmet experience.I do not regret going - the coasters carry the day. Just adjust your expectations regarding time management, and don't expect much customer service. Granted, I'm a Southerner, so the customer service bar is higher for me. We keep our hostility better-hidden than other regions of the country. :) Enjoy the coasters!",BedfordFalls

50,Best extreme roller coaster park that is family friendly,"We've been season pass holders for 5 years now and I have to say the park gets better and better every year. It's cleaner, more security which means not allowing foul language and bad behavior from kids. As a mom I feel much better about the park. They've also improved the bugs kids area and even have a sports bar for adults now. Thanks for the continued improvements! It's noticed!",Kim S
50,Knocked my socks off,"We had an awesome time here, but if you're going to do this, I'd highly recommend that you buy the flash pass. We bought the flash pass and were able to do 11 rides in 4 hours, meanwhile people were lining up for 1.5 hours for one ride. The flash pass is definitely worth the extra money. Our average wait was 5 minutes.We did most of the big rides and they were excellent. My favorite was Apocalypse, my partners favorite was Scream. Tatsu as a runner up for both of us. One or two of the older rides were a bit jolty on the neck/back, but all other rides were fun and comfortable. Most of the staff were very friendly. Just be aware that food and drink are very expensive here (as in ALL theme parks!)",Donna W
50,Awesome Thrills,"It took building a lot of courage and a lot of persuasion from my wife, but I conquered Full Throttle.

Fun for the whole family.",Perry L
40,Fun for the family,Fun place for entire family. Much to offer for teens and adults. Also fun areas for little ones with kiddy roller coasters and characters.Not a super professional park like Disneyland but you are also not paying the high price.Great picnic area in middle of parking lot with grass and trees. We usually picnic for lunch and buy food in the park.,Tracy J
40,"3-Star Park, 4-star Experience for Teens to Adult Thrillseekers","My kids are old enough now to where the magic of Disneyland is wearing off so we find ourselves here. Obviously a much different (and cheaper) experience here. This is not a good place to take the Grandparents with you. The ride selection is incredible and I think you can only do everything here in one day if you arrived at opening and went not during a peak season day.Park is clean and staff was friendly. Dining selections are so-so and efficiency of server diners is poor so prepare to wait in line or eat during off-peak times. Prices for food here are outrageous for what you get, even moreso than Disneyland. Guess this is where they make up for having the super discounted tickets.My 12 and 13-yo sons picked Colossus as their favorite. We loved Superman too even though it's such a short ride. X2, although very thrilling (and popular) was very painful as the rotation of the vehicle makes most people slam their calves into the base of the seat. OUCH! BEWARE!One thing to remember is you can use the tram to go through the middle of the park to save time if you need to go back and forth.It's no Disneyland but that's not what it's meant to be. It does a good job serving thrills to the teenage and 20-something crowd which seem to comprise about 2/3 or more of the people in the park. As I said, not a good place to take the Grandparents (unless they like roller coasters - fast roller coasters - a lot) and probably not worth the trip for kids under 12. They have kiddie rides but the vast majority of the park is more focused on hard core thrills.",jellyb

50,AWESOME FUN FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY,This was a fantastic day filled with adventure. I can't wait to go again this summer. The food was great and they had more options this time. Only one ride was out of order. I bought the fast pass and had time to go on every ride I wanted to experience.,Tanya M

I don't recommend if you've got younger kids or kids that like thrill rides under 54 inches. There isn't enough to do for the whole day with little kids, and the big fun rides are usually a 54 inch height requirement.

Frozen lemonade and funnel cake is a MUST when going to six flags! Make sure to ride as many rides as possible! But if lines are too long, be sure to ride tatsu, X2, Green Lantern, and Goliath! (Surprisingly enough those are the rides with the longest lines but they are worth the wait!!!! Especially tAtsu! My only downside is the food which was just overpriced, but what theme park doesn't have expensive food!",Summer J

There are roughly about 18-20 different and unique roller coaster located in the park. It took all day but we got to ride them all. I would recommend green lantern, tatsu, and X2 (as these 3 were my personal favorites). A little disappointed the batman ride was down, but maybe next time.",Josh W
40,"Great Rides, Long Lines","Six Flags Magic Mountain is a one stop shop for all your thrill ride needs. Unfortunately, many people have already figured this out. The lines are unbelievably long (my wait for X2 was over 1.5 hours), with only the later day hours having smaller crowds. If you don't buy a Fast Pass, you'll likely spend most of your time boiling under the hot sun (keep that in mind).The most popular attractions (with longest lines from my point of view) are:1. X2 - 4 dimensional coaster2. Tatsu - flying roller coaster3. Goliath - regular coaster with extreme speed and huge plunges4. Superman: Escape - Extreme speed coaster5. Viper - regular coaster with lots of upside downsMost Underrated Coasters:1. Apocalypse2.

50,Magic Mountain never gets old,"Every visit to the park is always an amazing and unique experience for me and the people that go with me. I could go a thousand times in a row and I would still want more; some times the crowds get big and the lines a bit long but we don't mind the waiting because the rides are worth it. However, we have never waited more than 50 minutes to ride anything but if the wait times get too long the Flash Passes are always available and very affordable. I personally love the enthusiasm of the ride operators even though some times they get under-appreciated by the crowds they still work hard to make people laugh and interact with each other and they're always friendly. I highly recommend Six Flags to my friends and family every time I get a chance and I also recommend it to people who have never experience a day in tMagic Mountain.

50,Thrills in Valencia,"I was at the Six Flags magic kingdom couple of times in the last six months.The first visit was by just myself in Nov 2013 and second visit was in early June 2014 with my extended family.It is excellent park and has good number of coasters for the thrill enthusiasts. The ticket is $45 if you book 3 days before the visit.Parking is $20 and is a five minute walk to the entrance from the parking lot.In summer, the entry to the lines do have shades and also de-misting for the heat.We did go for the regular fast pass so that we could wait for the timings outside the line and then enter through the fast pass lane.The regular fast pass was $50 per person and is quite expensive and does not include access to X2 and Full Throttle with fast pass.This could be useful mainly in summer when the lines grow for the rides.The food is fairly okay and has the classic fries, pizza and sodas.The following are the gradings for the ride experiences of the main coasters. 5 stars is max thrill.(1) Full Throttle. You ride both on the inside and outside of the rails and is great fun. (5*).(2) Goliath. Is a good classic 250 ft drop and highly recommended (5*).(3) Colossus. This year it goes backwards and that is move fun than the usual forward motion (4*).(4) Lex Luthor drop of doom. Is a fantastic 400 foot gravity defying drop (5*).(5) Scream. You ride in a harness feet dangling and is quite a ride (5*).(6) Batman the ride. It went backwards in 2014 and forwards was better and works similar to the scream ride (5*).(7) Green Lantern. The 360 degree flip is quite something and is unique in its design (5*).(8) Riddlers Revenge. A good standing coaster with multiple flips (5*).(9) Tatsu. You ride like super man, horizontal with face down and fantastic views (5*).(10) Viper. Has 7 inversions and is slightly rough (5*).(11) X2. You ride flat with face upwards and is quite fantastic (5*).We visit multiple theme parks and magic mountain is quite a nice park for thrill rides.I would rate it below the classic Cedar point though which is the best designed park with the most fun rides.",Ramgopal B
50,Wow what a thrill!!,"We stepped off the plane at 6.30am then picked up the rental car and headed straight to Six Flags. We purchased 3 day LA GO pass's so there was no time for rest or for jet lag to set in! It's an easy drive via the freeway with only a little traffic near the city. When we arrived there are plenty of parking attendants to guide you. Only problem at the front gate is a lack of clear signage or instructions on ticketing. If you get the LA GO pass then make sure you don't line up without getting a park entry ticket from one of the booths to the right of the steel gates that everyone lines up at to get into the park.Once inside, I recommend you but a six flags drink bottle with unlimited refills, if you're there all day you will get good value out of it for sure! One thing though , at some of the refill places the water tastes a little chlorinated, something we are not used to in Australia.The rides themselves are amazing and in some cases there was no line up which was a bonus. Some of these things go so fast, it's incredible!!All in all this was a great day out for the family that did not break the bank. A great first day in LA!",Pictographers

50,the best theme in so. cal,"I've never had such an amazing experience at a theme park. If you want to get the best out of your experience, go during the week when it's not very full. The gold season pass is a great value. It basically pays for itself the first time you go.What really sets sfmm apart from other parks in so.cal, are the rides. These are the best coasters in California, maybe in all the world. There's just a wide array of rides that's sure to satisfy everyone. Tatsu and x2 are amazing. Other great thrill rides include: viper, scream, batman, Riddler's, Apocalypse and many more.If you're looking for the best thrills and the least gimmicks, do yourself a favor and visit magic mountain.

30,Not as good as Discovery Kingdom,"As a season pass holder for Six Flags Discovery Kingdom and I prefer it so much more than Magic Mountain. Mainly because Magic Mountain is so spread out. You have to walk so far to get to the next ride. My biggest disappointed was the lack of shows. At Discovery Kingdom we have several animal shows as well as more rides. They granted season pass holders access into the park 10 minutes before the general public (at Discovery Kingdom we get 30 or sometimes 60 minutes). Not being familiar with this park we followed the crowd to a roller coaster only to find out it wasn't opening yet. We then followed the masses to the 2nd roller coaster only to find it was also closed. So the 10 minutes didn't really get us anything. The Viper ride should be shutdown permanently as it hurts people. Your head bounces around so much and hits the restraint shoulder bars. My daughter was crying after this ride and when we went into the restroom to get a wet papertowel, we found others that were hurt also. Skip the Tital Wave water ride, just stand on the exit bridge and you will get even wetter than you would if you rode the short ride.",Hellosusie

50,Great Thrill Rides and Flash Pass Worth the Price,"It's been years since I've been here and took my niece who just met the 48"" height requirement for most coaster and had a blast. The thrill rides are awesome the we paid for the highest level Flashpass, which cuts down the wait time by 90% (I think). You get a puck in which you can request rides one at a time and it tells you what time you can ride the next ride. For us, the typical wait was 5 mins per ride.Flashpass holders get to walk to the ride via the exit lane, so you completely bypass the regular line and they escort you right up to the front. We were able to ride ALL the bid rides in one day and repeat a couple with the Flashpass. It's not cheap, but if you can afford it, totally worth it.

Tatsu, Batman, Full Throttle, Goliath, Scream, Viper, Riddler’s Revenge and others kept us wanting to go bigger and scarier!",Macox0814
50,Thrill-seekers wonderland,"Lots of great rides here to suit all levels of thrill-seeker. In terms of pure thrill-factor of rides, this place is the top theme park in LA. Families with young kids and infants might not get the most out of the park as it's clearly targeted at pre-teens and older. Be sure to go early and experience as much as possible as the lines do get crazy as the day goes on. Full Throttle Sports Bar is an absolute gem! Really good service, good ambiance and very good food. Was very surprised to find food this good in an amusement park. We had the nachos, onion rings and buffalo wings, all of which were outstanding!",Joses T
20,Shame on Six Flags ! Not an American Way.,"Caution on Platinum Flash Passes and more ... The park has several unique roller-coasters, but many are similar to any other amusement park. We went on a Tuesday afternoon I had a Platinum Flash Pass (for all family) and lines were not so long, but to anyone I asked they'd say they were in line for 1;30 hs minimum for each 2 minute-long ride (they said not to believe the time signs on the line) The waiting in line has no distraction/amuzement like Universal/Disney/wahtever, you just stand. Bring fun friends with you. There is no commitment with scenario. What you look around is plain concrete, asphalt, fences and arid areas. The park is worn out. No hand of paint was done for the coming season and all places look dimmed. As the day goes by the lines get shorter, but services also get shorter (less employees, less restaurants, less snacks ...) so you'll alway find lines to everything. The Platinum Flash Pass ($ 100 each over the entrance ticket $ 45) has several limitations: 1st does not allow you 2 most popular rides that you have to pay $15 each per person. Does not allow you, as advertised, to ride twice the same ride in several rides or if you ride the first row. In other words, it only allows double rides where and when they find adequate.Are they dishonest ? Their lawyer obviously says NO because the small font lines in the agreement may say the are the conditions and the video you are supposed to watch before getting your Flash (damn) Pass explains that, but: the video was not shown to us because the person who was supposed to do that just said “Oh, all these videos you know what they say, just go ahead to the Platinum line”. AND it does not matter what he’d say: I purchased in advance by internet (to all family) and getting to the park is not the adequate time to know you limitations. SO they may be legally honest, but NOT morally clear and transparent like the American Way has thought us to be. The end line is always the employees that have to keep all day long explaining all Platinum gests their limitations and being hostilized like if they were responsible for that. Oh, don’t forget the unknown who-the-hell is famous VIPs … they enjoy the rides, as many times as they want, with private seats/cars and you just keep looking and waiting.SUMMARIZING: The employees are either willing to help and apologize or blindly following the arbitrary rules. You travel a lot North of LA. If you pay Platinum Flash (minimum $ 46 + $ 100 + 30 = R 176,00) you’ll feel like an idiot for you money, but if you don’t you should enter the line for any auto-flagellation. Of course I’ll never return and will never suggest anyone to go. ANY other amusement park you make you feel a better citizen.",worldwideleo
40,Magic Mountain June 2014,"Spent two days of fun filled excitement hitting the streets running and splashing our way to the Drop of Doom to land on our feet.

50,Adrenalin junkies paradise!!!!,"If you are a lover of roller coasters then this is the place for you...has to be the best theme park I have ever been too in the world, bold statement I know but we travel a lot with our jobs and go to a lot of theme parks.... We went on two separate occasions to be able to do ALL the rides, Would love to go back to California just to go back to six flags..I would agree with other reviewers that the food was over priced and not the best, I would take your own packed lunch.....all in all this is not for the faint hearted, roller coaster/ adrenalin junkies paradise!!,",Shae A
50,Great place for the whole family!,Great place for the whole family! Best way to visit us to be a season pass member. Fun for all ages. Spend a hot day getting wet at hurricane harbor and then walk right door for super fun thrill at Magic Mountain,R. H
40,Soooo many rollercoasters!,During a USA roadtrip one of the things we wanted to experience was an American theme park - we were not disappointed! So many rollercoasters to chose from - we ran out of time (and got a bit too dizzy) to go on them all! But the ones we did go on were exhilarating.Food was overpriced and unhealthy and there were some long queues (on average we queued about 45 mins - 1 hour per ride) but we expected that at a theme park.Annoyed at having to pay $22 to park - a joke when paying almost $40 a ticket! But overall a great day out.,eddlestoner
50,If you love roller coasters you will love this place,"We went in April 2014It is the best theme park I have ever been too. Roller Coaster after Roller Coaster.The day we went the crowd numbers were small. All rides only required a short wait and some u even walked straight onto.If you a roller coaster junky this is the place for you. If not I'd skip this park.They have all sorts of coasters, Forwards, backwards, suspended, straight up and down, rolling over and over. It was heaven.Park was clean and staff OK.Its a very hilly park and spread out of a decent amount of land. So it does involved a lot of walking and some hills. But that just gives you stomach time to settle before its thrown around on the next ride.If you in LA definitely worth a look. However it is a 40 minute drive and from what I read public transports if not the greatest. We hired a car for $60 which made getting to and from a breeze and I believe well worth the expense. (Note:- Car parking is $20).Overall a great day. I'd do it again.",DazzaMeg

10,Disorganized and complete and total rip off,"I have traveled to dozens of amusement parks around the country and I have never left one feeling more cheated. To start with, the season pass purchase process and 1980's technology, coupled with a big cumbersome robot u carry around in ur pocket all day to skip lines?!?!?! LAUGHABLE The people were not helpful and the facilities are gross!!! They nickel and dime you for absolutely everything (89 cents for extra salad dressing...paying individually for all major rides once you pay a fortune to enter?!?!?). Complete and total dissatisfaction!",Avogt25

40,Great fun and very accomodating for kids!,"Returning to six flags since its been years but this time around with kids, I was a little worried there wasn't much to do, but there was bugs bunny's world where there were rides that my kids could enjoy! This place was just as fun as I remembered from my last visit, only thing I wish they could do was keep the restrooms a little more clean as much as they could because I don't like seeing my children using restrooms with wet floors from who knows what. Overall great experience with family and friends, cant wait to return again!",Brian_8o8
30,Fun but repetitive,"It was fun but too many rollercoasters, avoid weekend, the only downside is the flash pass is too expensive, universal hollywood's pass is way reasonable to buy instead",Bob8y
50,A great time was had by all.,"If you can, go during the week because it's less crowded. We had a fantastic time because the rides were great, the employees were all friendly, helpful in giving directions and making recommendations on different rides. The park was clean including the restrooms.The only downside was waiting for the park to open in what is supposed to be lines but are nothing more than a mass of people at the front gate waiting to get in. Once the gates open many of the kids cut in and you feel like it will take forever to get in. But have no fear you eventually do get in.",Douglas S
50,5 Star for Coasters!,"Cedar Point calls itself the roller coaster capital of the world. I don't know who named it because Six Flags Magic has it beat! We have been to CP five times. This trip to Six was amazing! I have seen negative reviews but I think if I had long lines to wait in, I would have found reasons to complain. We went on a Wednesday. Just days before LA Public let out and it was great. Yes we waited in some lines. The longers was probably 30 minutes. We rode every coaster once. X2 twice. That did take the whole day. The coasters all seem to be a little different than the next. We bought the food passes on-line b/c they boast you get a savings. Not true. It was the same price as when we got there and do not charge a processing fee. Very misrepresentation. We also made the mistake of buying the drink cups and the food pass. It was cheaper to not do that! Oh well, live and learn....this is not Busch Gardens where it pays to do that. The park was clean. The staff were polite. The only annoying thing was that there was a middle school there and many students found it acceptable to cut lines right past you to join friends. What bothered me more was when teachers waved a group to cut in with them. What are they teaching these kids! Public teachers already get a bad rap from society, this upset me being that I work in public education too!! I would tell the kids to respect the rules and wait. Anyway, the overall experience was great. Loved the place. We did experience ride difficulties several times but they did not ruin the day. Be ware that some rides shut down for a while for maintenance and the way the park is laid out,it is not easy to ""just come back to it."" It would be nice if they had a train or skyride that connected two sides. By the way, X2 was the only ride we noticed that did not allow you to bring things to the platform. They made you get a locker. So glad we went. We are from the east coast and will not be out that way again. Six Flags over DC looks pitiful compared to this.",tamalePittsburgh

I went with a group of ten friends for the whole day event. If you go on the roaring rapids, make sure to bring extra pair of clothes because you will be soaked the whole day. It was unlucky to be walking in wet shoes and socks, but the experience overall was amazing!",julieerodriguezz

50,Best. Theme Park. Ever!,"Seriously... this place has SO much more to offer than Disneyland. As awesome as Disneyland is, as well as California Adventures (and the amazing Cars ride), for about 1/2 the price, you get a HUGE amount of rides.Sure, they may not all be spectacularly themed and amazing to look at, but they're thrilling and amazing.There's so many rollercoasters that I seriously don't remember whether I got to ride them all... But once again, the best time to go is the end of April / beginning of May. It's warm, the weather is settled, and it's just before the crowds of schoolkids arrive. The longest we queued was about 20 minutes. And we literally walked STRAIGHT on to ""Full Throttle"", which really is one of thbe most amazing rollercoasters. I still have a soft spot for X2 though...This is a theme park that I will return to, again and again, whenever I'm on holiday in the US, or in the area. It's clean, mainly well run, and the rides seem very well maintained and safe.",Dominic F
50,The most Amazing Time!,"The park was absolutely incredible, there are rides for any age group & preference, we as a family had the best time. We took our boys for their first time & they loved it, in fact we are planning on getting an Annual pass, they were mad that we had not taken them there before & honestly I regret that as well. The lines were fast, the service from the ride operators was very good friendly, funny, made our day there so relaxed & fun. Even the Parking Bus drivers were pleasant & helpful, totally recommend it, affordable & you will be amazed at the engineering & concept of the rides, have fun!!",Lisa V
50,Family vacation,"Had a great family vacation at Six Flags Magic Mountian. I am not the biggest fan of amusement parks because of the crowds, but this park was wonderful. It has nice wide walk ways so I never felt like I was going to bump into anyone. The park is well maintained and clean. Food is reasonably priced and very tasty. There were a lot of attractions for my 10 and 16 year old. I felt that there needs to be more thought put into the attractions for the smaller children, the ""under 42 inch group"". Other than that, this is a great park if you are looking for thrilling attractions and thrilling rides.",David L

50,Summer Thrill,"This place is like my ""Disneyland"" cannot get enough. The new ride Full Throttle is anything but disappointing. The lines were fair and average I think the longest we waited was an hr and that was for superman. Would highly recommend waiting for dark to ride X2 since the visual effects make that whole ride that much better. Paid the few bucks extra for a season pass and even saved a few bucks inside the park. Will definly be making this my new summer hotspot.",Elyse H
50,Sensational,"Our family of 4 visited during the week in early May. The place was nearly deserted so we had next to no waiting for rides. We had the most incredible day.

Would love to go again.",Chris P
50,Good Times,We went last summer and it's a really colorful place with a lot of thrill rides. Unfortunately it was over 100 degrees and we stopped there after a 7 hour drive.

50,"Love all the rides, hands down.","I love going to visit Magic Mountain in the late winter or early spring because it's not crowded with kids. If you go on the weekend or when the kids are out of school be prepared to wait in line for each attraction. Don't get me wrong the rides are great but why wait in line if you don't have to. The food is your standard fare nothing to shout about but not bad.**Special note: The roller coast ""Colossus"" closes this year in August 2014, so make a point of going before then so you can catch this ride, well worth it if you love roller coasters.",Lynn B
50,Very good,"It has its problems and annoyances but there are massively overshadowed by the quality of the park! No squeaky chairs and questionable ride safety.

50,Absolutely fantastic!,"I visited the park in the middle of May 10am-17pm without any queues and we wasn't able to ride every coaster! So many unique, extreme and FUN rides that you just have to visit the park. you can buy ticket online a couple of days before and you get good discount. Eat and drink inside the park is Expensive, so be prepared. Bring sunblock and don't forget to use it, otherwise you'll have a red back in the end of the day.",Ponti89
50,Best Six Flags Yet!,"Went to the park for a day with my boyfriend, and we both agree it was the best Six Flags we have ever been to. Very unique rides and loved the mist around the park for hot days. My only complaint was how incredibly pricey the food was; but, other than that, I really liked it! Definitely recommend to others, specifically those that are older and are seeking thrills.",chelsea1496
50,Great Trip with Plenty of Rides,We spent about 8 hours in the park and got to go on about 6 of the large rides and still have time for the kids to play in the Looney Tunes area. We are excited to go back and try some more of the roller coasters that we haven't been on yet.,Stan97
40,"Great Park, Great Rides, a little too greedy","We, as always, had a great trip to the park. We go often. I have nothing bad to say about the staff, they are always pretty often..BUT, I think that it is unfortunate that the employees have to enforce the ""forced pay lockers"" for some of the rides. That is literally extortion..it just goes to show that corporate greed is everywhere, even at Six Flags, and even when a family has to break the bank just to buy a drink there",paullrl1
50,Super man,i loved the ride but the measurement on it was wrong my son is 48 inches and for some reason on this ride he wasnt 48 inches so i would suggest someone measures the height limit . Plus my son was disappointed he couldnt go on this ride when he is 48 inches,Sarah G

50,Great day at the park,My wife and I took kids out of school for day of riding roller coasters on a Wednesday and had a great day. We are season pass holders which if you go more then once a year is easily with it as you get free parking and get in the park 10 min early which allows us to ride X2 with no wait. At pretty much all the rest of the rides their was less then 10 min to no wait at all and we ride 12 rides in 5 hours with a break for lunch. Highly recommend that you go on a weekday if can to avoid lines. Best and most diverse roller coasters around and X2 is the craziest roller coaster ever have been on,Eric E
40,Good Rollercoasters,"Good roller coasters. There is usually some sort of discount if you bring a can of coke. If you get thirsty and get tired of paying $4 for a bottle of water, any of the food outlets are required to give you free cups of water or refill your empty bottle for you.Also, if you invest in the large souvenir cups then some rides make you purchase a locker to store it while you are on the ride.",GarysJen
10,Horrible management,The only good thing about this park is the rides. But beware of the unprofessional horrible management and their stupid rules and regulations . A lot of the rides need upkeep but hasn't. Be warned if you lose something you buy or own they won't do anything about it or help until after hours . Especially when you have to leave because you live in another state the manager won't even come out to talk with customers when they are upset and angry . You are better off going to Disney land or world or universal studios than here.,dreamteam1523

50,Annual Pilgrimage (there's a reason),"There are not many places I elect to travel to visit at LEAST every other year, but Magic Mountain is one of them. In fact now that I think of it, it's the only place! There is a reason. These guys do theme parks well, and at Magic Mountain, the theme is EXCITEMENT! I am 57 years old and made my 1st trip to Valencia's 6 Flags at age 20! They were just in the initial stages of planning Collusus' that huge wooden coaster that still provides a great wooden coaster experience all these years later. Magic Mountain has the whole thing down to a science. Lines never feel long because most are designed around interesting scenery that augment the theme of the ride. The rides are all great, and I've been on all but Tatsu (too scary for me) and the other new scary looking one I can't think of the name offhand. EEK! Food prices are always high in these parks, but you can find a few spots to get affordable eats. Lastly, the park's safety record is excellent. It's always nice to know you are on well serviced, attended attractions. I still run from the lot to the entrance, every year. Now that's a review in itself! YAY Magic Mountain!",azironia
50,BEST THEME PARK,"Ok...Coming from the UK this had alot of dreams and expectation to live up to.....IT DID! While there is not much themeing here in the park compared to Alton Towers (UK) the rides shot all that out the way. BIGGER,FASTER,BETTER. We had 2 days here and only just got everything we wanted in twice. Superman Ride was personal Favourite but most rides there were quality.Can not wait to get back out here when anywhere near LA again! THUMBS UP!",Onnie4000

20,Pay through the nose for the flash pass or waste your day,"We made the mistake of going to six flags on memorial day wknd not knowing this when i purchased the tix online. We got a shuttle bus there which dropped us off at 10:15am and picked us up at 5:15pm and in that time only got on 4 rides.........if we had an extra $300 to buy 2 flash passes im sure the day would have turned out much better but thats alot of money and we were at the end of our trip. Anyway we went straight in and lined up for X2 as according to the sign the wait was only 30min......1hr 30min later still waiting then an announcement the ride is experiencing technical difficulties.Waited another 20min then decided to not waste anymore time and headed to The Viper, this took about 1.25hrs. Next ride was Tatsu, this also took 1.25hrs and countless people que jumping before we even got on. The fact that this park has signs on every ride saying que jumpers will be ejected from the park is laughable as we reported a group of 3 girls jump right in front of us to the worker 2metres away and she shrugged it off. The same thing happened with Riddlers Revenge and The Green Lantern. The wings shop we went to for lunch.....ridiculous. Ordered our food and waited in line for 15min with a group of angry customers waiting for their orders and no food was even served in that time frame. The staff didnt keep any order numbers so when food finally appeared no one knew who's was who's.Over all totally bummed about our Magic Mountain experience and wouldnt recommend to anyone unless had had the cash to buy a flash pass.",Jody H
50,Omg amazing rides,"I had so much fun. The best amusement park I have been to. The thrilling roller coasters almost made my heart stop. To avoid the lines get the Flash Pass. Worked really good and it's so nice to skip all the lines. Kind of expensive but totally worth it. Who wants to stand in line for 1,5 hours for each ride!? Because of the Flash Pass I had time to go on ALL rides in one day! Man, did I feel sick for two days after! Fun. Fun. Fun.",Daniel1976

We took the kids and decided to make Six Flags Magic Mountain a weekend trip. We all loved the rides ( Goliath is insane ), even enjoyed the expensively good food ( have to try the funnel cakes ). I do suggest that you splurge on the flash passes, you wont regret it. Some rides have over an hour wait and the pass ( depending on which level you buy ) will knock 90% of that wait off.The biggest issue I had was that the staff was horrid. They look and treat you like they are miserable. I mean i'm not looking to be treated like a king but man they make it seem like its your fault they have to work there. We decided not to let their crappy attitudes ruin our trip but mind you don't expect to be treated like a guest.",Jimmy M
50,An excellent experience,I had fun I came from Los Alamitos Ca. And it was worth the drive. The rides were an excellent experience. I would definitely come back. I don't like to leave.,Abby Z
50,Six Flags Magic Mountain,Awesome place for the family and its a way to bond with your kids. One thing I will also like to say is that Six Flags is the number 1 theme park in the world.,juicy_josh
50,Awesome!,"My friends and I never fail to visit this park whenever we're around the LA area. It's one of my favorite places to visit. Definitely the Thrill capital of the world! I love how every offers a completely different thrill and there are always suprises at every turn. We were able to get on all the rides on weekdays but weekends are a different story. Try to get at the park at least 30 mins early if you need your season pass/membership processed. Also, make your way around everybody else's sched. Like, take a late lunch if you need to because as soon as 1pm hits, everyone is eating and the lines aren't that long.",Allison V
50,only for the rides,I went just for the rides with my gf.. we made sure we bought the platinum flash pass and had a great time jumping from ride to ride. Felt like we put 3 days worth of rides into 1.,Chris G
50,Best theme park in the world,Best theme park in the world. Great if you enjoy thrill rides and rollercoasters. Otherwise I wouldn't recommend going.,Andrew C
50,thrill your life,"That's a fantastic experience for those who want to try thrilling rollercoasters. Preffered time to visit should definitely be a working day, otherwise you gonna be stuck in huge lines waiting for each ride. But anyway it's worth even waiting, don't miss that chance!",KennyFP
10,Badly Managed Park - Lines Are Way to LONG,"Went with family on a Saturday and there were many high school students with no adults running around hoping the lines and making the lines even worse. Sat in one line for 45 minutes and then they closed it and made everyone waiting exit the line. Shortest line was 60 minutes. longest was over 2 hours. This is ridiculous, we can buy the fast pass for $400 for our family, ouch....",cengstr
50,Last minute weekend family adventure!!!,"As a hard working mother of 4, I planned a quick, get out of town adventure for the kids. Viewing my online choices of which theme-park to choose from, Magic Mountain stood out the most. Not only was it the most affordable for my buck. But being that we went the weekend before a holiday, they didn't price gouge as some of the other theme parks did. For what its was worth, we zipped through the lines and nearly road every thrill seeking ride in the park. My family and I had a wonderful experience! Staff was personable and fun... We are most definitely making this an annual trip...",gcarr2014
50,Awesome experience!,We went on a Wednesday and manages to get on 13 rides! This place is amazing. Thrill rides for those seeking an adrenaline as rides for the whole family. Two thumbs up Six Flags Magic Mountain!,Mauro C
20,Not for us,This park is way too busy for my liking. There are too many people here and everything is expensive. We are not stingy but some things are a little bit too much in terms of price. I do not mind paying good money for a good product. But I will not crazy amounts for a lousy soft drink!,Samuel B
40,Amazing thrill rides,"We spent a Saturday here in easter break. It was really busy, as were visiting from New Zealand and were using a tour company to take us to 6 flags from Anaheim we knew that we would not get the benefit of the parks full opening hours. We pre-purchase the Platinum pass on line before we arrived in America. It wasnt cheap at an extra $100 per person but it was worth every cent and we figure since we had spent all that money getting there etc we wanted to make the most of our day. we had travelled on the shuttle to 6 flags with some Australians, one claiming to be the worlds biggest roller coaster fan. 6 flags was going to be the highlight of his trip. when we all got back on the bus at the end of the day we asked him how many roller coasters he had been on. His answer: 2, our answer with the platinum pass: 14 and that was riding some twice. He was gutted and we felt sorry for him that he had come all that way for 2 rides. The rides were amazing, the park is set out well and we didn't experience any line jumping or bad behavior as I have read in some reviews. I only have a couple of criticisms. 1: Toilets need some work and need to be cleaned more often and 2: have a separate line for people who have all ready brought and paid for their flash passes. It was properly the longest line we stood in all day waiting to pick up our flash pass unit with people who were wanting to hire and pay for them on the day. For anyone who loves thrill rides this is the place for you",taffynz
50,A Great Day,"I traveled in a group of 4 around the park, and we went on almost everything. We traveled clockwise through the park, saving x2 and viper for later. I would suggest bringing a small drawstring bag or something with a refillable water. Very convenient. There are lockers by most or you can set it off to the side while you ride. You may also want a water proof something, even just a ziploc because you must get carry your things on the water rides, and you will get wet on roaring rapids. Magic Mountain is an all day trip.",Haley B
50,Members-Only Night for Triple A Members,"I had a really great time. I sometimes go throughout the year for Fright Fest, summertime & Deaf Awareness Day. The lines were great, except Revolution was closed. My mom wanted to go on it. We walked around a lot & got exercise. It was really fun! Took a picture with Tweety. We ended the night with X2. It was way fun! I recommend going when you can! Its fun & eventful. There's lots to go & lots of rides to go on. The lines weren't that long. The music was great! I think more rides should be open more & not always under construction. Was bummed they took out DeJa Vu but it was having trouble operating. Didn't go on Full Throttle. Went on it last time during Fright Fest. It was way cool! Overall, I would always continue going to Six Flags! Bring sunscreen when its really hot out because you will get burned. Wear good walking shoes. Bring entertainment(some games or phone) to keep company while in lines or talk with other people in the lines. Its great to meet new people too.",Molly2644
20,"Great Coasters, but not much else.","Spent 2 days exploring Six Flags Magic Mountain. I purchased a season pass as it was cheaper than a 2 day ticket. I arrived the first day and spent 8 hours in the park. During this time I was only able to complete 11 rides due to massive lines. The posted wait times were NEVER accurate. Since this was my first time, I had no way to gage whether the length of the queue would be what they stated. Goliath had 30 minutes posted, it was 90 minutes. Collosus had 10 minutes posted, it was 30 minutes, etc.The food in the park was terrible and ridiculously overpriced. I waited in line 20 minutes for a hot dog. The girl at the counter did not speak english and struggled through my order because I wanted one ingredient held off. When I finally sat down and bit into the hot dog, it was bright red inside and tasted off. I promptly threw it out without eating it - a meal that cost $15 for a HOT DOG and a soda! There was too long of a line to go back and complain, although I doubt they would've done anything.The park is in such shoddy condition. It was the beginning of the season and everything was already looking run down and dirty. Paint was chipping, bathrooms were in terrible shape and more than half the water fountains that I was even able to find were not functioning. When something as simple as a paint job isn't maintained, it really makes me question the coaster maintenance. The Lex Luthor Drop of Doom was broken all day, and half of the next day. Green Lantern also had several downtimes, including one where guests were stuck mid-ride.The second day I returned, I purchased the Platinum Flash Pass with X2 and Full Throttle. The park was only open 9.5 hours and I completed 29 rides in that time vs. 11 the prior day. It made a huge difference, but really stung to pay $125 on top of park admission, especially since X2 did not have a line when I went back to use it. So that was $15 out the window and of course when you purchase they say no refunds for downtimes or if you don't use the extras. When you are handed the Flash Pass, they tell you it is not waterproof...there are 3 water rides and it's not waterproof...okay. They also advertised Jet Stream, but that ride was completely drained and never opened that day. The last real stinger, you have to return the Flash Pass BEFORE the park closes. So you either don't get it for the whole day, or you have to miss out on that one last ride to get to the front of the park to return it.The employees either have a bad attitude or display complete apathy. I had been on Lex Luthor twice and on my third visit sent once again to the same side. I asked if I could wait and see the other view. He told me no. I said I wouldn't mind if I had to wait extra and he just said no. On Goliath, I wanted to exercise my consecutive riding Flash Pass Privilege and they told me to just stay put and tell the next rider myself. I did that, the guest yelled at me and the guy didn't even step up and say I could do it, he just shrugged his shoulders to the guest even though I was following HIS instructions. Many of the coasters were only running one train, and the employees made zero effort to hit the countdown clocks to keep the wait time down.The park has some great coasters, yes, but it doesn't have much else going for it. There were very few tame rides to break up the beat down you receive from several of the coasters. I had bruises all over me by the end of the day. They nickel and dime you for EVERYTHING, including lockers that they force you to use. There is very little theming and the clientele was generally very poorly behaved. Swearing, inappropriate clothing, line jumping, and the like were rampant. I'm glad I went to get coaster credit, but I think I'll stick to Disney/Universal/Knott's during my future stays in California.",anonymous9257
30,"Love The Rides, But The Park Needs Something More","Hadn't been to Six Flags in around 10 years, and I live locally. Recently, they had the semi-annual private party, where it is closed to the public after 6, so I decided to go. Magic Mountain has always had the best rides for adults, and even the newer rides were fun, though deceptively boring-looking. But the park needs something more to attract repeat visitors, and I think one of the things could be a better atmosphere.The food choices are stifling: lots of greasy stuff. We went searching for something that wouldn't ruin our stomachs, and couldn't find anything, so we opted for chicken with fries. It has been a long time since I have eaten chicken from a bucket, but that's how it was served. And we sat at a table in the corner that was so well-lit with security lights, I got the impression that there may have been some incidences in that very same corner to warrant such high candlepower. Walking from ride to ride, all we saw were the same ""bucket-styled"" restaurants, so Magic Mountain really needs to mix it up and add variety.Some of the rides may need to be replaced. X2 was an hour wait in line, yet poor old Viper was empty. When you get to a ride that isn't popular anymore, you start questioning the condition and maintenance of it. Colossus was temporarily closed while they cleaned it up from some passenger's accident, but the operator also explained that they had to run it without passengers to air dry it. Some things are better left unsaid in my book--just say you have mechanical issues and leave it at that.Overall, I liked Magic Mountain, but it really needs to study Knott's and Univeral Studios to see how variety makes customers come back.",LeeTrotman
50,Very special day with my son...,"My son is an employee at MM, and he invited me to spend the day with him last Wednesday at MM (5/14/14). He got me in for free and the parking was free. We were able to bypass all the lines and get in just a few minutes before the rest of the crowd. We ran to Full Throttle and we were the first people on the ride. The day was absolutely fabulous. The lines were very short, and we ended up going on about 7 different roller coasters numerous times. I even went on Superman for the first time and loved it! I'm a 52-year-old mom with a weak back, so I was a little nervous but my son told me to SUCK IT UP, so I did. We went on Full Throttle 4 times, and I'm hooked. I LOVE that roller coaster! The employees were all very kind and friendly. The Full Throttle dude seemed to love his job. He would talk with the riders and tell them, ""okay, the ride will start in 3, 2..."" and then he would play with them and psych them out and the ride would BOLT them into oblivion before he would say ONE. Overall, my day was wonderful because I spent the entire day with my first-born son Arthur Ball!",cantseestraight

We spent our honeymoon here and our 15th anniversary because they are at the same time. This is the best place for an adult to be a kid and not think about the outside world.

We feel like this park takes very good care of it's park and customer. They had shade areas over the areas where you wait in line for rides, they had water mist deals in several areas of the park, shade trees, the bathrooms and grounds were clean. I feel like the owner puts money into this park and actually cares. The parking fee amount was the only thing that I felt was too high. Good job Magic Mountain!!",Marcy P
50,Must Love Rollercoasters,"They have a rollercoaster for everyone. Wooded, Loops, Speed and Twists. If you go on a weekend or a holiday buy The Flash Pass. A bit expensive but totally worth it. Weekday is the best time. Wear comfortable shoes and dress in layers",OPVoyages

We spent a little extra to use the valet parking which well worth it. All in all, a fantastic day!",Anna H

All of that said I can't imagine trying to enjoy the park without a flash pass. We got the Gold flashpass and didn't have to wait hardly at all. The one bad thing is that you can get some sneers from other park goers because they feel cheated (or embarrassed) that they and their kids had to wait while our party just walks on. Even so its well worth it. Plan ahead, save and get the flashpass!!",davidmK9447PM

50,Take a trip to your youth,"Many think places like Magic Mountain are only for kids, too inane for mature adults. Maybe, but not for sure. If you ever liked anything like this in the past (Coney Island in the 60's?) then you've got a surprise coming. These rides are safe, fun and exciting and way over the heads of the old timers - remember the parachute drops and giant swings - sort of tame. They go fast on fabulously engineered rigid structures that give you confidence. They do not depend on spinning you to dizzy nausea. They go high. way high, but you can't get out and fall, you are safely bound in like a part of the machine, no sweat. Get there early early and the lines are not long, late in the afternoon and early evening they are a drag, the flash pass is tempting but pretty expensive (check that). Keep in mind the place is really BIG, be prepared to walk a lot, starting with coming in from the parking lot. Expect to be welcomed and jostled, everybody is having a good time and it rubs around. You will end up feeling like a kid yourself.",Everett E

50,Exciting Clean Friendly,"The rides are definitely not overrated, very exciting day. I would suggest keeping most items in the car or locker, because I lost my wallet on the Green Lantern ride.

The g-force was so extreme: While my brain was attempting to leave my skull, my wallet succeeded in escaping my pocket.Awesome, friendly staff. Great food.

40,Best thrill rides in So Cal!,"Out of all the theme parks in Southern California, Six Flags Magic Mountain has the best thrill rides. This park is a roller coaster mecca, with most rides best suited towards tweens and teens. Weekends are crazy busy like any other park, so go during the week if at all possible. Summers are bloody hot in Valencia, so be prepared to buy a lot of liquid and wear a ton of sunblock. Six Flags has a new ""flash pass"" that you can buy to cut in front of lines, but it's not cheap ($40-$90) and requires you to wait in a separate line to buy the ""fast pass"" once you're inside the park. Attractions like the rock climbing wall and go carts cost extra. Hurricane Harbor next door is a blast during the hot summer months! Make it a weekend of it and do both parks in two days. BTW: Buy your ticket online if at all possible since the security line for the metal detectors is as long as the ticket lines. Also wear good walking or running shoes if you're going to Magic Mountain since the parking lot is a mile away and you'll be walking all day long in a big park.",Jerry Crawford

50,Fears Calmed-Great Non-Disney Park,"I really feared coming here based on the reviews I've seen. There are both advantages and disadvantages to this park. Let me start with the negatives:1. It's not Disney- Therefore, the grounds aren't ""pristine"" and the workers are not ""disneyfied"". It is what it is; it's a theme park.2. The kid areas are small. For good reason: It's a roller coaster mecca.3. It's expensive: Like EVERY theme park in America.4. Flash Pass People ""cut"" the line. Well, money talks!Now the positives:1. There are enough kid rides to keep little ones occupied for a day.2. The roller coasters are awesome and rival Cedar Point's collection (giving a slight edge to Cedar Point when collectively measured.3. The Warner Brothers and DC Characters are a good change of pace.4. I found the workers to be quite pleasant and helpful5. There are a lot of teens in this park, but on the whole I didn't find it to be ""ghetto"" at all.6. The park was not that crowded for it being Good Friday.My family of ages 31, 27, 10, 7, and 5 absolutely loved our day here and will return when in SoCal. Don't listen to the haters, this place is worth doing for at least a day if you have the cash.I would suggest if you do only one day to get the Flash Pass. it was super convenient and we got the platinum to ride twice in a row on some coasters. People get mad, yes: But it's what you pay for.",BryronDragon

50,The best roller coasters in the world!,"This isn't a park for the faint of heart, with its gigantic roller coasters everywhere! About an hour out on Anaheim, you'll find Magic Mountain - well worth the drive. As a tourist, you'll need a rental car to get out there and plan to spend a full day or two. We got the flash passes to get through the lines quicker and it was well worth the money considering how often we get there. Tatsu, X2, Full Throttle... take me back!",ExploringKiwisNZ
50,Excellent Theme Park,"Six Flags magic Mountain in Valencia is excellent! The rides are amazing! The operators are very polite and friendly, this makes for a great riding experience.",Sandra C
50,Magic Mountain is still awesome!,"I hadn't been to Magic Mountain in many years, but having been there the week before Easter 2014, I can't wait to go back again. The rides are as good (if not better) now than they were when I went semi-regularly, and the park has made a great many improvements. Lines were short (nearly nonexistent) the day I went with my family, and we got on everything we wanted to go on (except one ride, which had a tech issue) - we rode one coaster five times, and managed 17 rides in 8.5 hours. We will try to get back on a weekday before Easter the next time we go, too. The only negative comment about the whole day is that food/drinks are overpriced, but that goes with entry to an amusement park, I guess.",jaxuk1996
40,Thrill rides to die for,"We went on a weekday and had pre-booked the platinum fast pass. At first we thought this was a waste of money as the queues were short and the two big new rides were not included on the pass (hence 4 rather than 5 stars from me). We therefore still had to queue for these rides. Unlike the Universal VIP package, this didn't seem so special. You didn't always get right to the front of queues either, just jumped a large part of them.However, as the day busied up and the queues became longer the pass started to come into its own. Perhaps next time I would go for a Gold pass rather than Platinum as the time it took to walk between rides was eaten up by the pass anyway.But what about the rides. Wow! I have never been on so many high thrill, scary and genuinely stunning roller-coasters. They day flew by as we jumped from ride to ride, with a few water rides in-between to cool down. Our favourites - the full throttle loops, the speed of superman and the stomach churning Tatsu ride. X2 was out of this world, or it felt so as you rose above the park backwards! That drop and the screams and tears will live with me for a long time.Some have commented on the food. We took snacks but did treat ourselves to an ice cream at the end of the day. It was amazing and good value and finished the day off perfectly. If you are a high thrill junkie then six flags is for you. Smaller children would not find much here though.",gnreid
50,Dog kennels,"Dog kennels were free of charge they looked over my dog, very clean friendly staff and air conditioned. I loved the fact of the rv and motorcycle parking right by the entrance. Very happy customer",Samuel E
50,A great place if you love big roller coasters!,"This is a great park for extreme ride lovers, and they do have several rides for the younger crowd. It gets really warm here in the summer, so plan accordingly, or try to visit in the cooler months.",Shayne W
50,First Time at Park!,It was great for a first time at Six Flags. I loved the rides and the people. Lines were a bit crowded but never spent more then 30 minutes in line. People were great. Employes were so nice. Would recommend to everyone! Oh loved the cartoons too!,Joe S
50,Excellent,"The theme was really fun. I really enjoyed my time there. There only thing that i didnt like was the price for food. So pricey, I didnt like how we could bring our food inside to save money. My guest and I do not make enough income. So it was hard for us to get the food.",MonaPhink27
50,Always a thrill!!,"I been to six flags multiple times and it is always a thrill..The food might be a little on the expensive side. I also recommend that you visit during the week or on a Sunday, since there is long lines during the weekends like Friday or Saturday. If you are going to be around the area for a long time it is recommend you buy the season pass since is it only $5 more than a one day visit ticket. That way you can visit the park unlimited times during your time here in California. It's always a thrill you won't be disappointed if you are a thrill seeker. I will definitely recommend it.",Yael47
50,Amazing Experience!,"I was a little worried about visiting Magic Mountain because the last time I went (7 years ago) I had a horrible experience with long waits, rude workers, no checking to make sure your seat belt is working, dirty park, and gross food, but to my surprise my visit was amazing! My family and I went on a sunday during spring break and the longest wait we waited was 10 minutes! We rode all of the big rides too like Goliath and Apocalypse which were awesome! The food was great this time and the park was super clean with a happy vibe! We had so much fun that we even bought season passes and we are going back in about a month! I recommend this park to anyone even small children who don't like big rides!",Rollercoaster w
50,awesome time,Get there early. Eat before you go so your ready to hit the rides. It's a fantastic day by yourself or with friends and family.,EnolaGayW
50,Great,My trip to six flags was soo much fun I loved it the rides are amazing and exciting I love the adrenaline I get there is no other place that Has rides like six flags.,Laura A
40,favorite place to be at!,"I love visiting six flags! I got a membership pass and I go every couple weeks... inlive about 45 min away... I love viper! Its one of my favorite. I prefer going during winter or fall.. because during the summer. It gets way to hot, crowded and too much bees everywhere... one thing I dont like. Too much BEEs !!! But other than that its a place where I like to hangout",jm0709
10,horrible park,"i went there expecting to have a great time but was treated to horrible wait times, rides horribly themed and the staff like all other six flags parks have no interest and have no respect for you. some good rides but most of them didn't live up to their name i would never go to a six flags park again i highly don't recommend coming to this park or any six flag parks at all. i wasted so much money for parking entrance fees and then they wont let you bring your own food into the park so i was forced to spend 12$ for 1 horrible burger. then i had to pay 5$ for my bag on each pf the rides so i wasted over 500$ on useless crap. if you want to have a horrible day this is the place. you probably have much more fun watching grass grow.",100SFS
10,The worst customer care in the world,I am from out of town visiting. I came to the park on 4/12/2014 I feel as if I was being discriminated against. I was escorted off the property because my brother has a medical marajauna card.if you are black or smoke marajauna six flags will kick you out,woodster3000
10,I will never return again.,This park is in terrible conditions and service. There even are abandoned games and the bathrooms are dirty. There is nothing else to do if you don't like roller coasters unless you are willing to spend even more money in other games that have an extra fee. While riding the X2 game the coaster got stuck and instead of receiving help the employees were very rude and unhelpful. Please save yourself and don't go to this park.,Karla5454
50,Most roller coasters around!,"As Six Flags season pass holders in Chicago, we researched which Six Flags park to check out and this one was selected. It didn't disappoint!!!!! Went on a weekday during our Chicago spring break and had a blast. Short lines (especially compared to our Disney visit that same week), great food options for lunch (Panda Express and even grilling made-to-order) and not overly commercial. Weather wasn't hot so we chose not to do the water attractions. Reasonable number of rides and attractions for younger guests, no wait.",familygalChicagoIL
50,Epic Roller Coasters!,Six Flags Magic Mountain in California is a must if you like BIG rides. The coasters there are EPIC. The staff does a great job as well. We are locals so we like to go during the week when the crowds are smaller. Summertime at the park capped off with fireworks is just fantastic.,Cordell W

40,Great Park for everybody,"Be ready to walk a lot . It's a great park . We went for Halloween and it was FUN . Great rides, great funnel cake and a lot to see.",Janettodr
40,"Great Rides, Short Lines Today","This park has been a family tradition for a few years now. That being said, we've visited many times around, but this time was a bit different and perhaps one of the least stressful (yes, theme parks can be stressful lol) and more relaxing ones. We came on a Monday the first week of spring break in Nevada, which seems to be different from here because kids were still in school here. This turned out great for us as line were very short compare to the other times we've visited. On average I'd say we waited about half an hour for any ride even the most popular ones. Some like the viper had no line at all. This made our day very smooth as we were able to sit and relax in between rides without worrying about missing out.This is a great park for thrill seekers and would definitely recommend and come back. I would probably get flash passes from now on on busy days and whenever possible money wise. I can see the value they could add to our experience.",serrano e

Tatsu is amazing.",NMP

40,Fun but a lot of waiting,"I bought tickets online which was a much better deal than buying at the park. I always expect lines at an amusement park but this was the first time that almost every line there were some type of issues going on with the coaster. All-in-all, it was still a fun time.",nrt88
50,Lots of fun,Overall our experience was and always is great. My family and I greatly appreciate how hard each employee work to see to that our time is nothing but enjoyment. Thanks again for giving us a place to go as a family to enjoy one another at a place that's LOTS of fun.,Daniel And Tequ... W
10,Long Wait Times,"I have been to this park before couple of years back. However, I really enjoyed the trip then so decided to have a fun weekend again and specially drove from San Francisco just to visit Six Flags. But, out of my surprise, it was too much crowded, 3-4 hours of waiting lines for Tatsu and other famous rides. I thought of buying a flash pass as I didn't want to waste my trip and I was surprised to know that only Flash pass that can actually help us getting ahead on the line is $95 per person!!!!! Are you kidding me...!!! Other six flags have the same pass with very less value. Won't be visiting this parl in near future...",SoloTravellerSJ
40,Amazing experience and quite affordable,"First of all buy the tickets on-line at least five days in advance. That is the best deal. Compared to Universal studios this is a much more fast paced, energy and thrill ride experience. It is a bit of queues and the operation of on-loading and offloading on the rides was defo in holiday mode... But still some of the best thrill rides of the planet. And the sushi is the best theme park food I have ever tasted. You have to try it, and it is actually cheap.",Håkon Pedersen
50,Awesome day out!,"Being from the UK we are used to very mild roller coasters and only a few of them in one day! However magic mountain changes that all - there are so many intense roller coasters to ride! We went on a Monday and brought a flash pass, what a waste of time & money that was - there were hardly any queues, I think we probably only saved in total about 45 mins queue time!! So would definitely recommend not to bother with the flash pass on a week day. But other than the waste of money, we had a great day - would highly recommend, you've got to visit if your in California!",Ksmithy
50,Fun Time!,"I worked at Magic Mountain in the 80s and just went back. We had a great time! The park is WAY better than it was when I worked there. However, avoid going on weekends!!! Go mid-week and go on a lot more rides and wait in line much, much less than a weekend.",Jim B
50,GREATEST TIME IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA!!,Four of us friends went together to six flags magic mountain this past weekend and had the time of our lives!! I strongly reccomend this for everyone young to old!!! Its so much more fun then you can ever expect!!,Gina C

50,Must visit!,"If you love trill rides this is definitely the place to go! Ride employees are friendly and if you're feeling a bit risky, you should ride the drop of doom, total heart stopping, fun, excitement filled ride that will definitely make you want to go on twice! Also, the recent full throttle ride is excellent along with goliath, X2, and viper are MUST rides!",adriana s
50,Magic Mountain just keeps getting better,"It is risky to go to a childhood amusement park and tell your kids how amazing it is. Rides are older, it won't be they way you remember...It was 20 years since I went to Magic Mountain. Now I brought teenagers talking it up.OMG Magic Mountain is incredible, if you want a high energy, beautiful amusement park with unique and incredibly thrilling rides then there is no better place in the world.You literally can't go on all the amazing rides in a single visit. (OK the line wait times can be ridiculous, but they have flash passes with different levels. Worth it I am sure during peak season)",RayeON
50,AWESOME,"This was our first time at Six Flags Magic Mountain but I doubt it will be our last. This park has everything. Amazing rides, breathtaking views, and some of the friendliest employees I have ever encountered.",Justin M
40,Very fun experience!!,"Went on a Tuesday with my husband and we had a blast! If you like rides, go on the Superman ride! Went on it twice and both times were amazing! Do not go on the Riddlers revenge though! I felt nauseous on it and I usually never get sick on rides.You hit your head on the sides like a million times so I got a headache from that. All other rides were pretty fun. Ninja was a chill ride so even people who don't really like high thrill rides can go on this one. Since I went on a Tuesday, lines were super short so that was a plus. Food was super expensive though. But I would definitely recommend people to go to this park!",Laura M
50,How to Make Your Trip to MM Not Suck,"Save your money and pay the ridiculous charge for the Platinum Flash Pass. Seriously.I heard people talking that they had only gone on 8 rides the entire day, because the average wait times were between 1.5 and 2 hours. 8 rides? What a waste of a day!Yes, the passes are expensive, but I will never, ever go back without one. We went on between 25-30 rides, never standing in line for more that 15 minutes, and got immediate re-rides on many of them. (We went on Tatsu 4 times!)We don't get to go to MM often, so I would hate to leave feeling like I stood in line all day and got ripped off.",AZwanderlust
50,Great Familly Theme Park,The rides are great with just the right amount of thrills. The food is just like every other park- too pricy- but that's to be expected. Some of the hotels around the park offer discount tickets (better than the internet prices) so don't feel you have to purchase tickets in advance. It was a great day spending time riding with our teens!,Amy P
50,Great,It was an affordable adventure for our very large family!!! we were able to enjoy the fun atmosphere with many different things to do. we spent the whole day having fun together!! we loved the roller coasters and especially Full Throttle and Super Man rides. we plan to use our season passes all summer long all over the country!!! We can't wait to continue the adventure!!,slypigs8
50,8 Hours On 6,"Awesome Sunday afternoon spent at Six Flags enjoying brand new rides and attractions. Well worth the wait on Lex Luthor and Full Throttle, not to excited about Batman and Scream (some of the oldest on 6Flags), and definitely not riding Green Lantern any time soon (came out with a whiplash on my neck after this).",Juan R
50,Great Park for Roller Coasters,"We were visiting from Denver Co and we had never been to 6 Flags Magic Mt. It was nice because we went on a Monday morning right when it opened I believe some California schools were not out yet for spring break.. We were there March 24 2014 and we were able to purchase one day passes online saving us money. We all loved the park especially the cleanliness and the fact that every ride was operating since this was the beginning of the season. We def would recommend this park if you love Roller Coasters some of the best. We did not encounter long lines probably because we were there in the spring and not summer so I cannot comment on that time of year. Park is very well laid out. I would def recommend this park to families with children at least 48"" tall or they will not be able to ride most of the rides.. 52"" would be better and a love for coasters!. Great Park for the money better than Disneyland for the older kids and teens and less money.",joym99

50,Fun Day at Six Flags,"Make sure to bring plenty of liquids. I suggest you have a big breakfast, and bring some snacks (if you can, I am not sure about the rules about bringing food) because the food prices are outrageous and not very good.Make sure to wear comfortable shoes & socks. Bring sun protection (lotion, hat, sun glasses and cover up) Buying the flash pass was well worth the price, especially if you are not a regular visitor or live close by. We bought the gold and it worked out great. Waited in the fast lane 5-10 min when the line was listed as an hour wait time.Over all we had an excellent time, got on everything we wanted & some rides twice. Wish we did not pass on a few of them.",Elizabeth N
30,A day of waiting at Magic Mountain,"$20 for parking. Waiting, waiting, waiting in line for a ride, then the ride breaks down. Waiting, waiting, waiting for food. The roller coasters are a lot of fun, but be prepared do to a lot more waiting than at most theme parks. Limited food availability, limited bathrooms, no entertainment other than rides. Do not go unless you love big roller coasters - there's absolutely no other reason to go.",dhgetout
50,"Amazing day out, unbelievable rides!","VIsited September 2013. Took a day trip while staying in LA and well worth it. It was a lovely day - though perhaps too hot for us English folk (4/5 definitely had heat stroke at some point during the day).Unfortunately a couple of the ""top voted"" rides were shut during our trip but I thoroughly enjoyed every one I went on. And we ended with Full Throttle. The queue was quite long - about an hour - but it went quickly due to a live band playing next to us so we got to dance as we waited!So I recommend to do Full Throttle in the evening to get the live music!",jcdavies04

10,"Long waits for rides, broken rides, dirty bathrooms","We last visited Six Flags Magic Mountain in late 2010 and were impressed with the amazing rides.We visited again on 29 March 2014.This park has changed significantly, for the worse.At 10.30am, we entered the park, and rushed to the queue for X2 (like everyone else). About 30 minutes into the queue, we were told that X2 was ""experiencing a minor delay"". Long story short, we waited 1.5 hours in the queue before giving up. We did not get to ride X2 at all.While in the queue for the Riddler ride, again the ride experienced another ""minor delay"".The bathrooms are filty.Staff do nothing to stop the rampant queue cutting. This problem is compounded by management's failure to put on enough staff (there were only 2 staff left to check restraints and load/unload passengers on all rides).We will not be returning. Your time, and money, is better spent at Disney and/or Knott's Berry Farm until management fixes this theme park.",Adrian182
50,More like 10 flags!!!,Great fun for the family including all the young ones and the teens!! Plenty of rides to fill your Thill-O-Meter and sideshows for winning either a HUGE bear or simply a cape to fly around as Superman!! Lockers are cheap and bring a towel for some of the rides!!! Ride the mind blowing X2 or ride the stand up coaster Riddles Revenge! Great fun all around! Would most defiantly be a weekend well planned!!,Drew L
50,Magic Mountain with kids,"Let me say up front that we originally planned to go to Disneyland but when I looked online I saw that it was supposed to be incredibly crowded due to schools in the OC being on Spring Break. Instead, I took two nine year olds to Magic Mountain for a day of fun. The park was clean, well managed, the lines for rides was very reasonable, the food was good, the bathrooms were clean. There were plenty of rides appropriate for one of my girls who is only 51"" tall. The rides were excellent with our favorites being X2 (awesome!!) ,Goliath and Roaring Rapids. We did everything we wanted to do and then some. We arrived as the park opened and left when it closed. Very fun day and greatly improved over the last time we were there (probably 5 or 6 years ago) when I vowed not to return for a long time (park was dirty, employees rude, seemed like a lot of gang type people). I am thrilled to say that we will definitely be going back and I recommend Magic Mountain to families with kids.",Karen B

50,Better than expected,"Some of the reviews talked of a ""dirty park"" and ""rude operators"". I saw none of that. We went on a Monday and I told my kids get ready for long lines and only expect to get on 5-6 coasters since the park was only open for 7 1/2 hours. The longest wait was on X2 and Full Throtle but even with that wait, they ended up riding 14 coasters. Even finished the day with an extra ride on Goliath. As with most amusement parks, the food is expensive but I thought the internet day pass of $42.99 was very reasonable, especially compared to Disney parks. One final tip. Whenever the park closes, they close the line and let all those already in line ride regardless of the time. In other words, if the the park closes at 6:00 pm, enter the line of the ride of your choice by 5:59 pm and you will ride. That seemed very generous to me. This park is the Nirvana of roller coaster parks and that is what my family wanted ... perfect. One last thing. Some rides like Collassus have you place your belongings on the ground while you ride. We finished our ride and my stuff was gone, money, cell phone, car keys, cameras, everything. Some one grabed it by mistake then left all the contents still in the bag at the final exit for the ride. Thanks but it would have been nice if you would have returned it to a ride operator. We were very lucky to get our stuff back. Be very aware of this risk.",792SteveS792

20,Horrible experience,"Never go to magic mountain opening day of the season. I was there because of a school trip to the colleges in LA so I had no choice on the dates. This was my forth trip to the park and the first time I was disappointed with them. First, the bus lane to pay for parking took forever to get through. Half the rides in the park were not available for that day on the flash pass or the or the rides on the pass were all full. The rides all kept breaking down, I had X2 reserved at 11:30 and the ride broke down and I had to reserve a new time at 2:00. The ride lines all had at least one hour waits. My friend and I didn't start riding rides till 2:00 and we had to leave the park at 6:00. Almost every ride was running one train. Really on opening day with a park filled with people you will run one train. The school group that I was in said that they only got to ride four rides the entire time and we were there since the park opened. The flash pass like I said was useless, half the rides were not available that day. I was furious because I spent $130 for two people on the flash pass. Overall I was very disappointed. I will still return to the park but I will be more cautious when I chose a date.",sandiegolover12

Food is expensive but it is at any park. They allow you to bring in sealed water so save that $ and bring your own beverage. A fanny pack is a must so you don't have to leave your belongings behind at each ride. They have the best rides by far in California. I love Disney but they only have one thrill ride. This place is a must for thrill seekers. I just bought a year pass with parking for $40!!! That would only pay for a half of a day ticket elsewhere.,BruceHa
40,Awesome unless too crowded,"We had one day here and it was SO crowded--Wait times for the popular rides were up to 3 hours!! The rides were AWESOME! but wait time took a lot of the fun out of the day. Six Flags needs to open up more days in March when all the Spring breakers from surrounding states come! If you can afford it, do the Flash Pass but it is $40 beyond the price of a ticket! Parking is $20 and food at the park is very expensive. If you are going more than once in the year then definitely GET A SEASON PASS--it will save you on parking, and you will get a discount on food and merchandise. We stayed from opening until closing and still didn't get to go on all the rides we wanted to because of the intense crowds. Pros: some of the most thrilling and amazing rides I could ever imagine! Cons: no single rider lines for big rides, only open on Sat/Sun in Winter/Fall/Spring both of which make for super long lines. Park is best for teens and young adults. You have to be 54 inches tall to go on the best rides. When you go, be there early, stay late to avoid most crowds, wear closed-toed shoes. Avoid bringing purses or bags. On some rides you have to leave them on the side or put them in a locker. Best rides in this order: X2, Full Throttle, Tatsu, Drop of Doom, Superman...many other great rides. Some of them really jerk you around so if you get sick easily or are sensitive you may not want to ride or take ibuprofen before you go to avoid headaches. Would be amazing to go on a day when it wasn't so crowded--whenever that is??",Lauracello
50,Great place,I love this place need more rides! They should get Aerosmith rocking roller coaster. If your going to go make sure to stay hydrated its very hot there. We come here a few times a year.,chefdaddyallday
50,Great experience,Awesome rides! i highly recommend to buy a flash pass! lines are too long and you wont be able to ride any of them because you will loose a lot of time.Everyone should visit Six Flags ! It worth it,StephannieT02
40,Great coasters,"Went in mid-March 2014. Lines were 90-120 minutes for the good rides, but I think that is because they were only open on the weekends at the time. Once they are open throughout the week I expect the lines will diminish (some). If you are going for 2 or more days it is worth purchasing the season pass for $73. I have a hard time paying $65-95 per person per day for the Flash Pass though. As long as the lines were, I can't spend another $500-$600 per day for our family just to bypass the lines.The park has a great selection of rides, especially for riders over 48 inches - X2, Goliath, Drop of Doom, Superman, Apocalypse... And for those over 54 inches, Tatsu, Full Throttle.Scream and Colossus were closed when we were there.Batman was running backwards for season pass holders. I love roller coasters but hated this ride. It was jerky and gave me a headache that lasted all afternoon. Maybe it is better going forward but doubt it would make the ride smoother.The other things to keep in mind are 1) There is no quick way to walk around the park. There is essentially an outer loop and that's it; and 2) It is pretty hilly. Wear good shoes as you are walking up and down hills all day.My last comment is about the staff. Overall, they are nice enough, but no one, and I mean no one, is in any sort of rush to do ANYTHING - whether filling drinks, preparing food, processing tickets, or most importantly loading/unloading rides. I understand they have procedures they need to follow and that repetition/consistency can enhance safety, but it can be a little ridiculous. They walk back and forth down the platforms, have conversations with other workers, etc. and easily take twice as long between trains/rides as necessary. It's no wonder the lines get as long as they do.",J G
50,Lots of Fun. Get the Flashpass.,"So much fun if you like roller coasters. Get the Flashpass (gold), really important if you are only going for one day. Do not buy the up sell on X2 and Full Throttle (it is very very annoying that they want more money for this). Just go to these rides at 3pm when the lineup is smaller. We only waited about 30-40min.",Tim W
50,Magic!,"Went on a Sunday. Got into the park right after it opened. The only line I had to wait in was a short one for the metal detectors. It was a pretty warm day. Lines weren't very long. Hit Full Throttle first. Only had to wait maybe 25 minutes. Then we went to the pass holder preview of Batman Backwards. Which, wasn't my cup of tea. I have a problem now a days with too many twists and turns. I even took 2 motion sickness pills and still felt like I wanted to puke. :) We left early. Our main goal was to ride Batman before it opens to the public. Did it. Not many people there still when we left. It was getting hot though. We got to bring in bottled water, so do that! It helps. Go on a Sunday or during the week when they open back up and get there before it opens and hit the major rides and your visit should go pretty smoothly.",Phluffie
40,Great Park! Great Value!,"This was our second trip to Magic Mountain, but our first in over a year. Again, I see horrible reviews about the park. I really do not get it. The park was clean and I did not see or witness any of the crazy behavior some people mention. Yes, there are lots of teenagers. I have three myself. It does not bother me. The park was very full the day we went, so we opted for the Platinum flash passes. They are expensive, but worth every penny. The longest my kids waited was 35 minutes for a ride. Most of the time they were in and out in like 10-15 minutes. My only complaint would be the food. It is very expensive. But, what theme park has inexpensive food? None, I have been to them all in California. Go with a good attitude, understand this place is made for teens and thrill seekers, and if you see anything out of the code of conduct just let a park rep know.",JonDre
50,Season Pass All-the-Way,"season pass equals faster entry into park, and special surprise ride...Batman Backwards! That was excellent! Being treated special and a super short line, best ever!Its a Mountain so Pace yourself and stay hydrated!",Leighia1st
30,What they don't tell you..,"I wanted to avoid as many lines as possible. So I bought online the parking pass, the admission tickets ( saved some money there), and the flash pass. You dont save any money buying a parking pass online and still have to wait in the same line to go thru and park. You still have to wait in line to go thru the metal detector before the actual entrance to the park. You have to wait in another line to watch a video about how to use your flash pass with other who still haven't bought their flash pass. Then wait in another line after watching the video to pick up flash passes with others that have not purchased flash passes. They need to have a seperate line for vehicles who purchased parking pass online. Six Flags needs a faster way for those who already purchased flash passes online to pick them up. Took about an hour and half just standing in lines to enter park, watch video and pick up flash passes. Also some rides that were listed on the website as being part of flash pass were only available to season ticket holders. Two more rides listed were not working. So be prepared for two to four rides not being available to ride with a flash pass. Even with a flash pass Superman ride still had to wait additional 30 minutes after time on flash pass said to show up. Food was expensive and average as expected in being at an amusement park. Yes their was a 15-30 minute wait for food also.",AZskys
50,Six Flags,"This theme park is amazing. It has it all rides,food, and games for the whole family. I strongly recommended it if you want to have a good time with family and/or friends.",Alexis R
40,Fun if you like Roller Coasters,"6 flags is an amazing roller coaster theme park. I only ride the roller coasters while I'm there, so I can't really comment on any of the other stuff. There are enough roller coasters to last you all day and they are all fun enough to ride over and over. Full Throttle and X2 are really quite unique and some of our faves. However, don't go in hungry, eat somewhere else, the food is disgustingly overpriced!",Novarat
50,Six flags magic mountain,It was fun and excellent the lines were really that long just go in the spring not summer when its busy.,Kristine B
50,5 STARS!,"This theme park lives up to its name. Thrill Capital of the world! I had an absolute blast at this place. If you are a roller coaster fanatic, this is the place to go. I was blown away by TATSU! Two thumbs for Six Flags Magic Mountain!",Cindy S
40,A great time for thrill seekers,"I brought my sister to Six Flags Magic Mountain as a gift for her 14th birthday. We both love roller coasters so we knew this would be a great option for us. Our overall experience was great! The employee's are all very professional and incredibly helpful. Being a plus sized person (size 18) there was a ride or two that I was not able to fit in safely. I felt the employee's handled this situation with class and dignity and helped me not to feel so embarrassed, They gave helpful recommendations and I was able to ride the majority of the rides in the park. Of course the food is a bit pricey but that is to be expected in a theme park. Be prepared to walk uphill the majority of the time, so leave the flats and sandles at home and wear your best walking shoes. Overall, I highly recommend this park to people of all ages (and shapes and sizes too!).",lorih766
50,Great fun!,"I spent a day here in January with my sister and boyfriend. We bought our tickets three days in advance online which made it really affordable. The lines were pretty short except for a couple coasters, even though it was a sunny Saturday. If you like big fast roller coasters then I think this is one of the ways to spend a day in the LA area. We made it into most of the adult rides that day, with X2 and tatsu probably being out two favourites. We would definitely visit a six flags park again.",Kimmered
50,great roller coasters,"If you like high speed thrilling coasters this is the park for you. If you can, purchase a seasons pass. It's the best deal if you plan on spending at least 2 days at the park. The food is spendy.",Shari J
40,Awesome Coasters!,"Very reasonable ticket prices. Parking seemed a bit much at $20. We were there during off season, so they were only open on the weekend 10-6, and there were no shows. If you bring food or drink, they make you take it back to your car or throw it out. Huge variety of roller coasters for the whole family. However, the most popular ones (Batman, Tatsu) had only one car running, so the lines were crazy-long. Fortunately, all the others did not have long lines. The park itself needs some upkeep (landscaping, bathrooms, etc.), but if you rate the place on value and rides, it's totally worth it.",Michelle R
50,First time here for me,"My boyfriend took me to six flags for the first time , I had a blast. But we are so coming back so I can redeem myself on Goliath haha I cried the whole ride , my mascara was all over my face haha.",Michelle T
50,Wow!,"Been to two other Six Flags, Mass and Illinois, this one took the cake! The park was sprawling, bring your walking shoes. The rides rocked, adrenaline junkies heaven. Recommend getting Fast Pass. Friend and I stood in line for 25 minutes for first ride. We got there right at opening, sign said 15 minutes, not! Pizza at the shack was very cheesy. Food, etc. needs to rethink their queue lines. Very scattered and disorganized. Overall, will definitely go back!",kaidynsmom
50,Park has changed alot!!!,A lot of security walking in the park. Cutting in line has pretty much stopped. New rides are really fun...,Tracy T
40,Long lines,I love six-flags I love the rides but I just don't like that every single time I go lines are extremely long idk how we could fix that but if we can I'm sure it will please a lot of people not just me.,Margaret R
40,Whoa!,"We were there in February and there weren't very many people so lines were very short. The park was clean and staff were friendly. We liked most of the rides that we went on but the X2 was out of control, crazy. These are definitely an adventurous step up from your average roller coaster.",TrudyTraveler
50,Six Flags Magic Mountain,"We went as a family to Magic Mountain on an all-day trip. The park is spotless and the employees across the board are very helpful and friendly. I live near the park and have been going for ages. The difference for the better between now and even 10 years ago is enormous. I feel completely safe bringing my children here, and we always have a blast! It does get very hot during the summer. If you buy or bring a bottle of water, you can get it refilled with cold water for the asking at most, if not all, of the food merchants. I would recommend picking up a map when you first enter, and then going around the park in a circle. This park has fun for all ages, and many very thrilling rides and coasters. All in all, a great value across the board.",Traci M
50,The most exciting and thrilling experience,"Magic Mountain the most amazing and thrilling park I have been in a long time, awesome rides, I could feel the adrenaline in my body, excelent service and attention. If you want to live an exciting day, go there... and try to ride all the games, dont miss Full throttle and x2.",marcoocampo23
10,Customer Service policy is to lie and steal to their customers,"Yes, Magic Mountain has an assortment of exciting roller coasters and is reasonably priced, but their lost articles policy has left an awful taste in my mouth.When adults and teens visit a park like this, it is inevitable that the groups will split up into less and more adventurous. For this reason, it is important to have cell phones so that kids/parents can be found again throughout the day. That said, my 15 year old son had an Iphone deep in his pocket on Tatsu, a scary coaster. Said phone fell out during a period of time where he was waiting upside down for the next part of the ride. He and his friends saw the phone drop intact to a nearby platform. Afterwards, customer service had us register the item online and said they would retrieve it after park hours and email us that night or the next morning. Now it is 3 days later and no email, no phone number that allows a message or reaches a human, and I've found out that 6 flags sells all lost items to a refurbisher within 3 days to be resold on Ebay. They never had any intent on trying to get the phone back to my son. This is outrageous and why I will never return to this park",TamarG_12
50,Not for the faint of heart!,"I love Magic Mountain. I've been coming here since I was a kid. The roller coasters are soooooooooooo fun!!!! You will only like it if you like roller coasters as there is not much else to do. First, buy your tickets three days in advance. You can save a lot of money on your tickets. Second, I bought the Fast Passes this time. There are three levels and the first just lets you reserve your place in line with the same wait. The second level is what we bought. It cost $130 for two people. This cuts your wait time in half but it's actually much better than that. You set the next ride right when you get to the current ride. So by the time you get there, it's been 30 minutes and you can get right on. Mostly we just walked right on every ride. Then there is the platinum level which cuts your wait time by 90%. But really, since it takes time to walk to the next ride, the Gold pass works just fine. The biggest and lamest part is that it doesn't work for X2 or Full Throttle. I thought for $190, it should work for ALL the rides in the park. We ended up not going on those rides because the wait was almost two hours. You could add one ride of each for $15 per person per ride, but since the Fast Pass is on top of the ticket price, it just couldn't be justified. We already spent about $225 on tickets and Fast Pass. The great thing is that we were finished with all the ride by about 4pm so the Fast Pass really helped us get on everything with minimal waits. The other thing that's worth it is the $16 sports cup. All the drinks for the day are free after that. We must have filled up at least 10 times so we got our moneys worth there. All in all, it was a great day. Expensive, but good to do once or twice a year.",Melissa D
40,"Fun day,park need a little update","We were surprised by short waiting times and lines. If you can,come in february! The weather its not so cold and there is a few people.Of course, the rides are fantastic,love the new games.The bad side, we ate at katys kettle, and it was a poor service,even there was no people. Also, I wanted a potatoe, and they were out of potatoes.I also noticed, the park conditions, Its not well maintained, I dont know if because was low season, but the bathrooms were not clean enough, among others.We arrived at 12 pm, and we were able to catch 7 rides.",Cristina F
50,Best Amusement Park,"I love Magic Mountain, it is full of different things to do. Definitely bring walking shoes, and avoid bringing big bags as you cant take them with you on the big rides. I also like bringing a water bottle with me, because the employees are happy to refill it with water for free. I end up saving a lot of money and being hydrated all day. Get there as BEFORE they open, and when they do get up the hill. Start at Superman and make yourself around that way youll have many of the rides out of the way before the second wave of people arrive. Eat as late as you can, as around 2:00-3:00 o lock the biggest wave of people arrives and thats when the lines are longest.This is definitely an all day thing, but you can certainly just drop by for a few hours. If you do make sure its the morning.Pay attention to the number of people there are in your party and their taste in rides. Try to have at least two people who like the biggest rides and two who don't. So you can divide your party and no one will feel left out. Definitely bring cell phones so you can find each other afterwards.Try going around the park and getting on the rides as you find them so that you avoid spending excessive time walking.For the rides where you can pick where you sit, choose the front rather than the back. The front provides a smoother experience that doesn't pull you forcefully.Everyone can enjoy six flags as long as you bring at least two of each group. If youre a group of teenagers who love the biggest rides dont bring just child, as he will have to wait outside for most rides, instead bring a friend with him, or someone who doesn't mind not going on the biggest rides. You can always divide and then join each other again.The line wait are getting better and better. The park is really going out of their way to help with this. I recommend this park very much!",Stefany M

50,Birthday Fun At Magic Mountain,In November of 2013 I went with 3 other people to Six Flags Magic Mountain for my birthday. It was a day to remember. Although it was a bipolar weather day it was a lot of fun! The average waits in a line depending on the popularity of the ride was 5-15 minutes or 20-35 minutes. Those wait times aren't bad compared to waiting a good 2 hours for just one ride.,Anna S
40,Kids first time,My daughter and son thoroughly enjoyed their first Six Flags Magic Mountain experience. If you plan on riding as many rides as you can (we rode 14 on our one day trip) bring a light pair of tennis shoe and also pack light.

50,Fright Night Fun,"This was our 2nd time coming from Canada to go to this. We went to the park during the day for the rides. There is a lot of rides and hard to go on all of them in a day. If we come back we will get the fast pass as we weren't able to make it on all the rides we wanted to go on. At night they had the haunted houses, Fright Night on where the park is transformed in to a bunch of scare zones with haunted houses. THis is a must if you will be here when this is on, houses were well done and lots of scare actors walking around to scare you when you least expect it. Fright Nights is my favorite part of going to the park!",Ashley
50,Best Six Flags,"I've been to a few Six Flags, Epcot, Universal Studios and Disney in both Florida and California, and Silver Dollar City. Magic Mountain definitely provides the most unique types of ride, in my opinion. Instead of a bunch of conventional roller coasters where you sit there and it goes around really fast and does loops, they changed up the way you actually enjoy the rides. For instance, the Joker, where you'll be strapped in while standing up for the whole ride, another one (Tatu??) where you'll laying face down the whole time, and another, where your whole seat rotates 360 up and down as you're racing around the turns and loops. Lots of fun! Expect long waits for many rides, especially the one where you're laying face down the whole time. Also, long walks.",David G

Great rides, a good selection of different foods, not so many healthy options which was a little disappointing but as we were on holiday it wasn't the end of the world.

30,"Some fun rides, but park needs some TLC","Rides were generally fun for myself and 8 yo daughter. The X2 scared just about everyone on it - including us and the people who could believe she went on it at all. Park itself looked a bit beat up and rough around the edges.For those going to the water park (adjacent to the thrill park) as we did, be sure to bring water shoes - the pavement is scorching hot by noon. The ones they sell are pretty awful and expensive. Also, the locker you can generally get in the thrill park is about 2x+ the price in the water park. The giant funnel ride was fun and we'd wished we would have gone on it a few more times before the park closed for the day.",ex-expats

We went 3 times all during the week and off season. I imagine it gets crowded on weekends and in the summer which would make it harder to get in a lot of rides.",joeh198

40,Great place for thrill seekers!,"I've been a Magic Mountain season passholder for 14 years now, and I just can't seem to get bored of this place. Magic Mountain offers roller coasters and other thrill rides unlike any other rides I've been on. One big suggestion for new visitors is that you might wanna go to X2 first, if you find yourself among the first group of riders,,,it will get packed! Otherwise, head onto Tatsu, since it will attract so many people throughout the day, and the lines will remain long. Head back to X2 around 3pm, when the lines have decreased. Visitors must never leave the park without experiencing Goliath, Lex Luthor Drop of Doom, Riddler's Revenge, and Colossus. Other than that, the park offers thrill rides, and they also have a segment called Bugs Bunny World for the children. Just a little heads up, be prepared to pay $20 for parking, and if you don't mind spending a little extra money on food that might not fill you up, go for it; otherwise, there's eateries such as Wendy's and Red Lobster down the hill from the amusement park. I'd definitely recommend having the S'mores Funnel Cake for snacking...BOMB! If you go in the summer, take some sun block, since it will get incredibly hot there. Overall, as I've mentioned, I've been a passholder for 14 years, and I always have fun there. Go and see for yourself.",armysgt1981
30,Thrill rides with poor maintance of the park,"This is a fun park but needs mantain the rides because some of them are closed and others like Ninja and Viper have a loose in the tracks and during the ride your head shakes hitting the protector, I had heavy pain in my ears due to that that lasted at least one day.The use of the gadget to reduce the lines is excellent but expensive specially for the newer rides.I would like to see the park with more cleaning people and different kinds of food, there are few places to eat with limited seating.",Alberto M

40,Fun with the grand babies!,"Overall, great fun and quality time with the grand babies! It would be nice if all rides were open in the children's area.",Melanie G
40,great rides,"Great rides, but lines in the best attractions are too long (the flashpass is TOO expensive)!As an opposite of disney's parks, employes are careless, always in bad humor.The park cleaning is very poor, very defective.Food places are too above the standard parks fast food (disney, universal etc).The rides itself are really cool.",TioGabriel
50,Coaster Heaven,"We had one day here and were determined to beat the unexpectedly huge crowds and fit as much in as possible. We'd got cut price entry tickets so we bit down on the proverbial bullet and splashed out on the Platinum Flash passes - at $95 each they're not cheap but they let us have a go on all the big coasters that were operating and in fact, if you want you can sit on and ride twice. We didn't do that as we wanted to get through as many as possible, it being about 4 years since our last visit.The coasters are well reviewed and our old favourites are still great, Tatsu, Colossus and my personal favourites, Goliath and Viper. The kids loved the new ones but raved about Riddlers Revenge.The food in the park is the usual theme park stuff, but not too overpriced. Actually we don't tend to eat much there as we usually stock up on a big breakfast at the Denny's just as you turn off the freeway, so that we don't have to waste valuable coaster time by eating. However the kids needed refuelling and the chicken strips and fries were reasonably priced and of decent quality. We bought one of the refillable drinks which definitely saved us money over the day.Our only real grip was that all the water rides were closed. On reflection, we realised that it being mid-December there probably wasn't a lot of call for water rides, despite the unseasonably high temperatures. Being hardy Scots, we'd have liked a go on Roaring Rapids or Tidal Wave but we were clearly in the minority. Anyway that was probably a worthwhile sacrifice as unlike our previous visits in mid July, visiting at the end of December was a lot more comfortable - in the high 70s rather than the low 100s....perhaps that also explains why it was so busy.Despite the crowds, the park never seemed overly busy when walking round though we never saw a line for a popular ride that was less than 2 hours long, so we reckon the expense was worth it for the passes. The park is well kept and very clean, and though we weren't near them, there are plenty of rides for younger visitors too.Best advice? Eat heartily at Denny's before the park opens (leave plenty of time for this as the service is unusually ropey at this branch) then be in the car park early so you're at the main gate by opening time. Arriving early and staying to the bitter end guarantees the best value for money here and we were among the last to leave. All in all it was a great day and we will definitely go back next time we're in southern California.",piglit36
50,What a GREAT day!!!!!,"If you are on a mission and are serious about roller coasters buy the Platinum Flash Pass. It's worth the money. My husband and I rode 10 coasters. You just can't do that with a regular admission fee. I felt kind of bad for all of the people who had to wait 1-2 hours, but not really. They obviously don't have their priorities in line. If you want to just stroll with the kids and stuff your face full of junk food, then have at it. I recommend getting a baby sitter, eating a healthy breakfast (because you'll puke if you don't) and really doing it right. We had So. Much. Fun!!!It pains me to admit that I had to take a break after the fifth roller coaster and I found a super cool oxygen/massage hut that fixed me right up! I spent a few minutes hooked up to an oxygen tube which pumped peppermint/eucalyptus scented oxygen to my weary brain, then took a turn on the waterbed/massage table and PRESTO! I was good for five more. We left feeling FULL rather than wishing we had more time. And P.S. FULL THROTTLE!! Just do!",Pattio666
50,Ariel's Best experience,My favorite ride was x2 and colossus and scream and goliath and Jetstream they were all like cool rides you could just look in the sky and you can see the whole park,Ariel A
50,awesome for the price,"other than x2 never working magic mountain is a value for your season pass. the rides are fantastic. lines are too long, but worth the wait",Ray M
40,it was fun and ready to go more times.,it was fun they have lots of rides but you needs to get the pass in order to go faster on line and have more fun,mario m
50,I'm coming back!,"It's an upbeat day at Six Flags Magic Mountain! The attractions are excellent! Although there may be long lines at times, it is well worth the wait! The ""hype teams"" (ride operators) make the ride experience even better! It's an all day visit on a mountain so walking shoes and my souvenir cup are a must. Can't forget my camera for the beautiful views of the city. I'm definitely going to try to come back!",Jessica N

40,Great fun,"Got there early on the 31st December 2013 and was already long queues to get in but moved very quickly once the gates opened @ 10.30am.Was very warm that day in the valley but temp dropped quickly later on.Got a Platinum pass which was fantastic for avoiding 95% of the queues and certainly made sure we did every ride we wanted to and more. Only got delayed in the Superman ride, take the groups of 4 queue doors, groups of two is stupid as only two seats and increases your waiting time exponentially. The staff on that ride on that day also had no idea how to fill seats to minimise waiting time which did not help sending many trips with empty seats.The old rides are dated and in my opinion not worth the time or bruises but each to their own. Long way to go not to try everything you can.All the same, the new rides are the way to go in my opinion, Tatsu and Full Throttle are excellent. To pay another USD15.00 per head per ride to skip the queues on full throttle even though you have paid USD90.00 for a queue skipping Platinum card though is unreasonable I thought.Food and drinks are expensive as is the whole day with parking and a locker on top. Nothing is cheap here but was worth the trip but would most likely not go again. Maybe for the water rides in summer perhaps.Staff performed like robots that ran the rides and seemed completely uninterested in your enjoyment, but as long as they check you are strapped in I guess..... The general park staff were excellent. Plan your rides, top down or bottom up or you will go in circles.",Richard G
50,dates to go,"i would recommend going in the colder months, it is california so it was 70 when we went. go against the crowd and u will wait in almost no lines. i rode all the rides i wanted to when i went on the 2 on january, i rode them all twice actually:)",Hayley M

40,Magical,"Six Flags Magic Mountain is the second of the SF parks I have visited (first being Great Adventure). This park has a friendly vibe, with reasonably enthusiastic staff. The rides are great fun! The park is generally clean, although some of the dining outlets can get a bit messy later in the day.Full Throttle is particularly recommended as well as a visit to Cold Stone creamery.Pretty disappointed that for the second time, X2 was not operating, which seems to be a pretty common occurence.Definitely worth a visit if you're around LA.",Jamie M
50,Quick Trip!,"My friend and I went after work and managed to get there 3 hours before the park closed. We managed to fit in lunch, 5 roller coaster rides, Dole Whips, and dinner. We had a blast and can't wait to go again! :D",Zak $
50,We love this family-friendly park!,Our family of 6 has season passes to Magic Mt. and go as often as our busy schedules allow.

We feel it is well worth our time and money and we are grateful to live within a reasonable distance from this great park.,Allison C
50,good parks for young kids,"This is a good enough rides for family with young kids ( people usually think Six Flag is only have scary rides).

I will definitely be coming back time and time again and will recommend this to everyone!",Jared O
10,Dangerous with terrible customer experience,"This experience made me very very upset at the management. Instead of fun I ended up with bleeding scuffs on my elbows and horrible customer service. I would advise to wear elbows or knee protectors when sliding. Does it make you worried about the safety of your kids? Certainly it should. This place need a solid upgrade and a safety audit. To me it became a safety concern.As to customer experience, make sure you print everything out if you purchased tickets from a third party website. Otherwise you will just have to stay out. We had a confirmation in the smart-phone. It wasn't accepted. Luckily the nearby police officers were helpful to get us in. Nightmare! Stay out and keep your kids out!",Luna
40,Epic,"Six flags will give you the best thrilling rides in California and out of most theme parks of the world. They are smooth, intense and epic. I haven't found better thrillers that this place yet.",Ruth S

50,Thrills For The Whole Family!!,"Having been to all of the Six Flags parks, this is by far one of the best. There are enough thrill rides to satisfy any thrill seeker, and enough calmer rides to appease those who aren't so brave. Wear comfortable shoes. You will be walking a lot, waiting some, and screaming over and over again! What a great way to spend a few hours!",VanEsq12
50,Exciting rides,"Rides have a good range from young children appropriate to thrill seekers. The extreme rides are fantastic and the park offers a lot of superlatives: the highest, the most, the first. The rides are updated (like reversing direction) periodically to keep the park fresh. There are lockers, but expensive ($8 per 2 hours). Better to leave pack in car or leave it on the ride platform and trust that it will be there when you return. The long lines are a big negative, but most parks like this are. If possible pick a day when students are in school to spend more time riding less time waiting. It is still amazing that parks have not caught up with well developed technology and developed an app that shows ride wait times. Maybe the park leadership could ask Google Map team for some help.",holt1001
40,Lots of high quality rides,A fun amusement park with lots of thrill rides and kiddie rides. We arrived at park opening and were able to get on the rides we wanted. We ate at two different restaurants and had good meals in the parks. The staff was really helpful and the price is right.,Joe R

50,Fun for the whole family,"We have been going to Magic Mountain for about 16 years now and are excited to see the continual improvements at the park. We have a teen and a small child and both love the park. There are lots of attractions for kids and adults. Of course thrill seekers love the park, but so do little thrill seekers in training. Six flags offers discounts online and even at full ticket price the value is there! Both Looney Toons and Super hero fans will enjoy all the characters and rides based on these characters! The only drawback was we went the day after Christmas and the park was packed and their fast pass system is an expensive upgrade. I would suggest avoiding school holidays during the winter (pick a weekend not near a school break) and avoid weekends during the summer (pick a weekday during summer maybe Tuesday or Wednesday). An overall fun day for the whole family.",Madeline B
40,Good experience,"My experience was very good! There was so much to do, don't know where to start when you first arrive!

There's things for everyone to do.",Dana M
50,It's so Fun,I love coming here. The rides are always fun to get on. If you are an adrenalin junkie like me this place is super recommended. Full Throttle was my favorite ride there. if there is a line it is worth the wait. All the roller coasters are worth the wait here. The only thing bad that i can say about this place is how Viper gives you a huge headache after riding it. Other than that this place is my Favorite amusement park,Xiomara G

40,Christmas Break Enjoyment,"I visited Six Flags Magic Mountain with my family, all of whom have season passes at another Six Flags amusement park. This particular park has several things working in its favor. The weather is an obvious plus. Management is able to keep the park operating on a regular schedule all year round. As amusement parks go, the entry and exit from the parking lot is also quite easy. I have waited for lengthy periods of time trying to get out of the parking lot at other parks; this is not a problem at this park.Magic Mountain specializes in roller coasters and thrill rides. It is best suited for teens and adults that enjoy these types of rides. I personally think Full Throttle is more hype than thrill, but it is a fun ride. Tatsu, Batman, Scream, Riddler's Revenge and Viper are all excellent rides. Superman is disappointing. Unfortunately, X2 was not operating the day of my visit.The park is fairly clean, and the staff is fairly friendly. I actually took my family two days in a row so at we could ride every thrill ride. It was crowded both days, and we needed two days to ride everything we wanted. We did not get flash passes, which would have reduced our time waiting in line.There are so many good things in this park, but there are a few negatives as well. The park layout is strange. The walking paths seem to ramble, and finding the entrance to some of the rides is difficult. They simply are not where I thought they would be. The staff need help loading and unloading the rides. They simply are not fast or efficient. A little hustle on their part would reduce the time in line for everyone. Finally, the prices for everything are ridiculous. Things at amusement parks are expensive. This is true of food, souvenirs, games, etc. This particular park, however, offers a real punch to the gut when it comes to prices.All in all, it is a great park. My family thoroughly enjoyed themselves, and we would come back again without hesitation.",Greg A

40,Six flags - fast pass,"Six flags overall was a great experience. We paid for parking and our tickets prior to the event for a discounted price. It was crowded and there were lines which is to be expected. We waited 45 mins plus for the first ride. We then saw people going through separate lines. we then found out there were fast passes that are in 3 groups. reg, premium and gold. gold gets you on all the rides 90% faster. Which was WAY worth it, for a fee of $100. especially if you have children. Later to find out you can get these passes for <$40 online. GET THEM!",courtney m

There are many rides that are appropriate for this age group, such as Gold Rusher, Ninja, Revolution, etc.The park is always clean, the staff is super nice, and we always have fun.The lines during low times (cold months, during the week, etc.) are always short. You can ride as many rides as you want...and your kids won't drive you crazy about standing in line!!Tip: get there when the park opens and head towards the back of the park, to ride on your favorite rides several times in a row with no lines!",thymetotravel999

40,Truly the Happiest Place on Earth,"Wonderful place. Friendly staff. Wonderful rides from Tatsu to Goliath. From Full Throttle to Green Lantern. Had a great day at the park. Wonderful Xmas atmosphere. And most importantly, we didn't have to rush and push with crowds and crowds of people. This is truly the Happiest Place on Earth. And not like the park that claims that title but truly is not. I'm not from LA, and this is the third time in 3 years that I am visiting Six Flags with no regrets. I've skipped that other park 2 years in a row, after a horrible time there 3 years ago. So for anyone coming for a good time in a theme park, forget the one in Anaheim and come to Six Flags in Valencia, California. You'll find that you'll enjoy yourself a whole lot more for a whole lot less. ( hint: buy a season pass and you only need to visit the park 2 days and you've saved some money.)",semaj2307
50,Great! Had tons of fun.,"Everything you expect from a great theme park. The food is a bit expensive though. Other than that,great!",GeorgeTheIncredible
50,Always Great,"SFMM is always great. I try to visit during off-peak. That way, I can usually get around to every coaster in the park and then some. The danger is that a ride or two might be closed. In our most recent case, we didn't get to ride X2.We did, however, make it onto Ninja, Superman, Goliath, Apocalypse, Tatsu, Full Throttle, Batman, Green Lantern, Lex Luthor, Colossus, and Scream. We then re-rode Superman and Tatsu to end our day. Personally, I usually try to hit up every coaster in the park (kiddie coasters excepted). But that doesn't always work, depending on whom you are with.Ninja - fun diversion as long as there's little wait.Superman - way more fun in reverse.Goliath - still an excellent ride despite its age.Apocalypse - love the relentless, out-of-control speed.Tatsu - still my favorite coaster in the park.Full Throttle - interesting concept and easily the smoothest coaster I've ever experienced.Batman - showing its age.Green Lantern - looks great theoretically but just OK.Lex Luthor - standard drop ride, but awesome height.Colossus - a classic that is still fun.Scream - a real head banger.",thedlr
30,Not the same..,I recently went to six flags with my family I was a little disaponted I had about 4 years of not going it is not the same it looks really worn out its not taken care of the paint is very old not as clean as before the restrooms are even worse my 9 year old son said he's has seen gas station bathroom that are cleaner and its true the doors are coming off there dirty and not taken care of . Magic needs a face lift big time a little sad to see it like that rides are still fun but not worth what you pay for at the door. Food is also very expensive and not worth it..,TRAVELINGFAM951

20,2.5 stars,"A large theme park with a great selection of roller coasters which was unfortunately spoiled by two glaring factors;1. 4 rides in 4 hours (lunch was skipped) is not a good return for the money spent on park admission for 2 people & parking.2. Closure (for maintenance) of several roller coasters - two of which were meant to be the park's flagship coasters.Whilst Tatsu was an impressive roller coaster, of all the other things we could've done in LA on our last day, six flags just wasn't worth it in the end.",Ben P

The longest I waited in line for a ride was almost 2 hours (for X2) and I didn't have to waste money on the Flash Passes. The other rides were a breeze to get on, most wait times being less than an hour, and some rides didn't have a line! The workers are very enthusiastic and helpful around the park and create a joyous atmosphere. The variety of rides is amazing and there's something for all ages. The food is like your typical theme park food—overpriced, yet tasty. Parking was fast and easy since we got to the park early. It was my first visit, and I really enjoyed it.

50,Visitor,The rides are great fun. The key to a great time is avoiding long lines. Best way to do this is get a Gold Season Pass and get to the park half an hour early. Gold pass members get in the park 10 minutes early. This is allows you to be the first person on rides that usually have a wait of over an hour. Then keep moving towards the back of the park and you can usually get on 5 or 6 rides with no wait before the crowds hit.,John K

40,Fun rides! Great thrill!,Be careful not to purchase any fast passes until you find out how the crowds wil be first because they are non-refundable. I went during spring break and the park was completely dead which was good because it felt as if we were the only ones there. There were some rides that were questionable as to how safe they really are. Some felt like we were gonna get thrown off because they looked and sounded like they needed repair but overall it was super fun. I rode all the rides and i would definitly go there again but i would only go for one day.Great rides! Try them all!

The thing I loved the most was that they had rides that were thrilling but not too extreme which was perfect for my friends who didn't like the huge and thrilling roller coasters. There were plenty of activities and rides for both of us to enjoy! I hope to be able to come back as soon as I can!",Dalia S
50,Great Rides If You Have The FLASH Pass,"I'm close to 70 years old and It was in my Bucket-List to visit Six Flags again. My son arranged the trip and spared no costs. It was fantastic, we were able to avoid all the lines and ride twice in a row if we wanted. The day was extremely invigorating, the rushes from the new: Full Throttle, Green Lantern & Tatsu were almost overwhelming. The old stand bys: Viper, Goliath & Superman again were worth the trip alone. After 14 rides, just maybe I'll make it back again. If you can afford it buy the pass.",Barbara M
50,Great Park!,"My family just loves Six Flags I buy my both of my sisters a pass for their birthdays every year! we just love the place! we go whenever we have the chance, and the free friend passes offered to pass holders gives us the opportunity to bring cousins or friends along with us often. The rides offer a great thrill, and they are always working to make new exciting rides. This summer the ride 'Full Throttle' was opened, and it is amazing. It has such a huge loop, that the ride slows down at the top. 'X2' and 'Tatsu' are my favorite rides. 'X2 is a ride with seats that spin while the coaster moves! and Tatsu has a sort of inverted loop at the end that will make anyone scream in excitement. I recommend this park to anyone looking for great thrill rides",bugsy262
30,"Great Coasters, when open - Food is a rip-off","First off; it was a total bummer to learn that one of the premier rides and my favorite X2 was closed and had been since sometime in June. They expect that it will be open by Thanksgiving; what a gyp!So, my son and I went here for three days. The first day was very busy due to some cheer/dance thing going on and the lines were pretty gnarly. We still managed to squeeze in a few fun rides and have a good time.The second day, Sunday, we went ahead and sprung for the Platinum Flash Pass; what a great idea, at least for this day! We couldn't get to the rides fast enough. There are three levels of Flash Pass: Standard just holds your proverbial place in line at the current ride wait time while you do other things around the park, and you show up at your designated time and get on the ride. the second level (Gold?) reduces your time in line by up to 50%...you get rides faster. The best and most expensive is called Platinum. It reduces your wait times by up to 90% and on most rides, as long as you don't sit in the very front or the very back, you ride twice. On our Sunday experience, we waited in the rider queues an average of 5-10 minutes. Our next ride reservations were always ready for us before we even got off our current rides. The ride twice feature isn't so popular with other guests; we caught a lot of dirty looks. However, we favor the front of most rides, so we didn't use this feature all that much.Now, fast forward to Monday, a holiday. We figured we had so much fun with the Flash Pass that we would do it again. Not a good idea. If the park isn't very busy, you end up wasting a LOT of money ($200 for two people). This day, we waited in line as long as anyone else; 2-3 times as long as the busier day before. It was not fun at all. Not that I would have minded waiting 20-30 minutes per ride, I was just not happy that I paid $200 for the privilege. By 1:30, we were pretty much done with this crud, so we decided to leave. When we went to return our Flash Pass, they of course asked, and I told them: On slow days, you folks should be honest and tell people the truth. Either don't get a Flash Pass, or at the least, don't get a Platinum one. The young manager was pretty cool. I was prepared to go so far as to reverse the charge through my credit card, but he stepped right up and offered us a complimentary Platinum Flash pass for up to 6 people on our next visit and also gave us two front of the line passes for Full Throttle (Full Throttle and X2 are extra.). I left overall happy with Flash Pass. They have come a LONG way from when they first started; it was a mess!Now, a few things about the park. 1. It is really getting aged and dingy. 2. The food is still a rip-off, and on Sunday, we waited longer just to order a burger than we had on any ride that day, like 45 minutes. 3. The refillable sports bottles are still a decent deal if you plan to visit more than one day, despite shrinking to 22 ounces for 2014. Also, unless you are sharing a bottle, the $5 a day wristband may not be the way to go; you end up needing to get 6 fills to make it a deal. 4. The USB jump drive seems to be a good deal. You pay 30 something up front, and you get digital versions of all your photos for 99 cents each (1.08 with tax). This includes ride photos as well as the park employees that wander with cameras starting at the front gate and also the ones with the costumer characters. I'm still pretty disappointed that I missed Wonder Woman (LOL), but maybe next time. The drives are good for a year and they even have backups in place in case something happens. The first little code card you get, hand it over with each purchase to avoid amassing a stack of these cards.Overall, Six Flags Magic Mountain is still my favorite West Coast theme park, but I have given it lower marks due to X2 being closed for so long, the food prices/wait times, Flash Pass snafu, and the missing Wonder Woman. Apparently, Flash Pass is ran by a third party company, but it still reflects the overall experience of the park. I have my 2014 season passes, USB drive and sports bottle, so I plan to return, but we'll see if they have it all together by then!",ToeKnee_TM

Season pass is the way to go because there is so much to do you probably won't get it done in one visit.

50,Excellent,"Online bought the season pass with free parking gold membership, stated expires 11/03/2013 I was expecting the staff to state these parking pass expired. Even though I purchased them on the 11/07/2013. I thought it was a hoaks or typo or something considering you have to use once before Dec 29, 2013 but I went in showed them the season pass and for parking and they let me in. I am okay I didn't say anything and went inside the booth the take a pic for season pass and they confirmed yes free parking, gold membership included in season pass. I was amazed no hassle, no gimmicks, friendly staff and GLAD that I didn't need to explain anything. Everything they posted online was true, Greatly appreciated.",Nichole G
30,Beside the hour wait just to get in the gate????,"Tons of high school groups. Get there early to avoid waiting in line for over an hour just to get in the park. Hundreds of people and one little operating gate. Metal detectors..... We bought our tickets online to avoid the wait.... No use.The rides are fun and awesome. But after the wait only 6 hours in the park??? For $50.

50,Love it,I always love coming to six flags! I always turn into a kid again. I always make time to come throughout the year.,Carol D
50,SO much fun! Definitely worth the visit.,"My hubby and I purchased tickets online and printed via our hotel - much cheaper than paying at the gate. You can also book parking online for $20. We wanted to go on a weekday so it'd be quieter but unfortunately it wasnt open on the Monday we wanted to go, so had to visit on a Sunday.We got to the park just after opening - car park was already packed. A small walk up to the front gate, a lot of lines but it moved quickly. Lots of people in the park, including a sea of cheerleaders from different schools! Thought to myself there & then that we'd be expecting long lines due to the number of kids in the park. It wasnt too bad. Some of the more popular and new rides had long lines - longest we waited was around 45 mins for Superman (and there had been some issues/delays with the ride) and probably the same again for Golliath, Tatsu and Full Throttle (but they were all well worth the wait!!)There are SO many rollercoasters in this park, so if you're a fan of them this is definitely the park to go to! It definitely beat our trip to Universal which was a bit boring and over quite quickly as there were not enough rides for our liking.We didn't get a chance to do all the rides unfortunately - however by the end of the day we were a bit rollercoastered out so it didnt bother us too much. We did about 3/4 of the park and got to experience a lot of the rides. Favourites were probably Tatsu and Scream - and I really liked Apocalypse! It has the old rollercoaster style look and feel but comes with a lot of power - it goes super fast. Great fun!!",Debrahrah
40,great time...but don't expect any substitutions on menu!,Rides were great. Lines for rides averaged about an hour. Meals expensive.

50,Magic Mountain Experience,Had a very fun experience and every thing worked out fine for except the food and drinks being to expensive. We spent 500 for the park alone and not including food and drink and shopping,GG0dinez
50,Love This Park,We've come to this park a few times and always have a good time - but this was the first with our kids. So much fun - the rides are always getting better. We managed to avoid lines until the afternoon hours hit. If you like roller coasters and a variety - you will like this park. The kids couldn't get enough and wished we could go back the next day - we stayed until the park closed. Plans are in the works to hit-up some of the other Six Flags for future family trips.,coffeeNchocolate
40,Love this park and would recommend it.,"We always have fun at this park. We were only disappointed by a couple things: They had tore down two of our favorite rides (Log Jammers and Déjà Vu); the amount of people who ""jumped"" ahead of us in line was ridiculous (mostly junior high aged kids having their friends meet them in line); and one of our favorite rides (The Viper) was way more rough than it use to be and caused me bad neck and head pain. Otherwise this park is always as good as it has been. We didn't wait in line longer than an hour, and we enjoyed our time there. The employment is nice and helpful and the prices are pretty good compared to most such as Disneyland. There are a lot more ""adult friendly"" rides and the kids area has a lot for them as well. We still love this park and will definitely try and go more often!",Amber J
40,Rollercoaster Heaven,"Love Coasters you'll love Six Flags, they have most types of coasters and they are fantastic, if you go during a week day you can pretty much cross off most of the park very quickly. Only thing that lets them down is that there the staff don't monitor the lines all that well so you quite often have coasters going with spare seats in them.",marktravel2000
50,Sick at Magic Mt.,"My daughter got sick on a visit to the park with a home school group. I wasn't with her but the young man at first aid called me and told me what was happening, what he had done for her and what my options were for continued care. I never once felt that I was out of the loop and in the dark about what was happening to her. I will not hesitate to send her again without me because I know the park personnel can be trusted to take care of her if sick or hurt.",Elizabeth B
50,"Homeschool Day, Fri 11/1","The rides were excellent, lines were short, food was surprisingly good (overpriced, but typical for such parks).

20,Rides were excellent but queues are a joke!,We had heard a lot about this park & as we were on holiday from the Uk we really wanted to go. Tickets were about $75 each & we were there on a Fright Night day which we didn't realise at the time. We'd originally planned to go during the week but it's only open limited days/hours at the moment. The rides were huge & the fastest rides I've ever been on & great but we managed about 4 rides in total. The queues were massive & moved really slow!!!!! We'd also visited the Disney parks on a Sunday when it was absolutely heaving with people but we didn't queue for more than 45 mins for anything. .,Marie K

30,disappointig,"I had heard so much about this place, I was really excited to be able to go. We had about an hour and a half drive and arrived just on opening time. We walked in and first ride I see was the brand new Full Throttle with a line up of about thirty people. It was great, inside out, upside down twists and turns, then backwards and forwards again. GREAT. I then continued on to Colossus, it looked huge, I had a look at the line up and it looked good I could not believe my luck so I jumped on, MISTAKE, it turns out the line ups are concealed and it went for about an hour, a long time for a two minute ride, good, but too long a wait. I don't know if the large crowds were due to it being Saturday but we were suppose to go on a Monday but it just didn't happen, or whether it was Halloween or perhaps both. All I know is that I am not in a hurry to go back. By the way my favourite ride was Batman.",rabbitf59

50,Six flags magic mountain.,I love six flags. You get alot of bang for your buck. The lines are always speedy. The longest we waited in line was about 90min and a few rides we walked right on. The week days seem less busy than the weekends. We went for fright fest and go every year. We are in love. Would recommend to my fellow adrenaline junkies.,Travel315289
10,Waste of time,"We had a Go Card for Los Angeles. There were 20 people in front of us and 3 people serving. After 30 minutes, 5 people had been served. That is pathetic. It was a Saturday on a long weekend, the park was really busy. We figured it would take another 1.5 hours to reach the front of the line, just to get into the park. We cut our losses and left, $20 poorer for parking. I can't believe it. This is Six Flags bread and butter, how can it be so difficult just to get people into the park. Unbelievable. After going to Universal Studios and Disney this was such a joke.",Jane707
50,Amazing World Class Park but plan your dates.,"I went to Six Flags about 10 years ago, and i was blown away by the sheer scale of the roller coasters. However it was very busy, and the queues were crazy. The X2 ride (back then it was called X) was absolutely astonishingly good, never been on a roller coaster like it, but it was a 3 hour queue. So this year, after 10 years of remembering how awesome it was there, i booked a trip slightly out of season, whilst the local kids would still be. In school. This paid off. We waited for 45 minutes for the Riddler Revenge ride, and no more than about 20 minutes for everything else. the new rides, Full Throttle, Scream, Apocalypse, all just fantastic, and we got on all the rides. Our trip coincided with the first day of the FrightFest and so the park was open to 1am, with all the rides operating until that time. I have been concerned that it would be really busy, so we allocated 2 days of our trip to this park, but thanks to the savvy time planning, we nailed Six Flags in a day, so we went to Universal the next day, and guess what.... No queues there either. In fact there was literally no queues at Universal and we were able to walk straight onto rides. So thats my tip, Six Flags is drop dead amazing, its got the best rides, but pick your days to go because the place is notorious for its long queues and theres definitely dates you can choose to avoid them. Also to note, its not the best place for young kids because the best rides are all ridiculously big. Im 40 years old, and i think its the best theme park on earth.",Steve P
20,So Much Wasted Potential,"We visited SFMM for the first time on a recent trip to California. Being big coaster fans, this was exciting because Magic Mountain has more coasters than any other park in the world. But just having a large number of roller coasters is not enough to make a park a good experience and Magic Mountain falls far short on almost every other aspect of running a park.First, the parking lot is in horrible disrepair. There are so many cracks and holes that it is a treacherous walk from the car to the sidewalk. This level of disrepair is found throughout the park. Magic Mountain does not seem to pay much attention to any of its older areas or attractions. They build something big, shiny, and new that looks great, then they move on to the next big, shiny, and new thing and forget all about everything else that is already in the park. Every single one of their older coasters looked run-down. With some TLC, the whole park could be very attractive, but they do not seem interested in anything except what is new and next.Customer service was beyond horrible. The absolute worst I have ever experienced in any park or anywhere else for that matter. While at Guest Services, we saw a man come in bleeding from a cut he received in the park. He asked if they had any Band-Aids. The Guest Relations representative did not seem to care and did not direct him to First Aid. He just replied gruffly, ""we sell them over there,"" and pointed to a gift shop nearby. Another instance, one of our party was attempting to get up into the seat of the Green Lantern (which requires you to jump or lift yourself into it). After struggling for about 1 minute, this person decided that she was not going to be able to get in and did not want to continue to embarrass herself by attempting it and hold up the coaster any longer. The ride attendant had been watching this whole time from about 5 feet away. She finally pointed over to a corner and said, ""there's a stool over there,"" but did not offer to go get it or help in any way. After getting the stool herself and being able to use it to get into the seat, the attendant came over and kicked the stool away. These were just a couple of the outrageous examples of horrible customer service that day.Operations on the rides is also ridiculously bad. If you took the employees from a well-run park and put them operating these rides, I think the throughput would instantly double. Ride attendants are horribly slow at unloading and loading the rides. It is certainly not because of being over-cautious because they are barely paying any attention to what they are doing to begin with. A line that looks like it should be about 5 minutes will usually take about 15-20 because the line never moves because they are taking so much time at the load area.Six Flags Magic Mountain is a large park with the potential to be beautiful. There are some great rides there and some others that could be great if they were better cared for. It is extremely sad to see that management has let the park get to such a state. I would go back and give it another chance in the future, but based on our experience, I have no desire to plan a return trip anytime soon.",swacer

10,Don't waste your time,"Went to Six Flags as they have so many cool rollercoasters, the kids were so excited. On arrival it took about 30 minutes to get into the car park which worried us a bit but we had pre paid so went in. The park is only open for about 7 hours a day in September which is insufficient. There were what seemed like 100 000 people there and the shortest wait time for a ride was 50 minutes with the worst being about 120 minutes, which is unacceptable for a 3 minute ride. We stayed for 5 1/2 hours and got on 5 rides it was absolutely disgraceful, I would never recommend Six Flags to anyone. They allow way too many people in, the ride operators never totally fill up the rides, and there is not enough ride staff. What a complete waste of time and money. I would never recommend to anyone, especially families with kids. What looked like the best American theme park ended up being the worst !",Sam753
40,Awesome!,"What an amazing theme park!!We decided on a flash pass and it definitely worked out in our favour! Make sure you use the time in between reservations to do all the rides with small lines. The only problem/downfall to the day was when my fiance hurt his back on the green lantern rollercoaster. This was by far the worst coaster I have ever been on and I don't see how a healthy 26yr old can go from being fine to being in crippling pain in under 1 minute. Be careful on this one...Goliath and Tatu were my favourite!! They were awesomeeeeeeeeeeeee.Have fun, pack sunscreen and have some frozen lemonade! :)",ssejmi

Cameras are good but for most of the rides you will have to put it in a locker. It cost like a dollar and you can use it for a few hours. It is for sure an all day thing, there is a lot to do and a lot of cool rides, like X, Goliath, Tatsu, Superman and of course Lex Luther Drop of Doom, Enjoy!!!!",Sumer_Grl007

We wanted to wait till our son was old enough and tall enough before we came here, because a lot of the rides are for older kids. He was not disappointed at all! He loves thrill rides and this park has a lot of thrill rides. Warning....if you go on the rapids ride....you will get soaked! We came off the ride with our pants, socks, shoes and shirt all wet! When we walked away....water was dripping off of us!",Reneeyoshi
40,Pleasantly Surprised,"Upon reading the reviews of Six Flags Magic Mountain, I was a wee bit skeptical of what we would encounter. I imagined roving bands of unruly teenagers and trashy grounds. What we found was a fabulous, family-friendly amusement park! We have a teenager and an eight-year-old and BOTH of them loved this park. The rollercoasters were top-notch, and the kiddie rides were great, too! Yes, the bathrooms were dingy and somewhat untidy, but nothing I wouldn't expect for the volume of people this place hosts. Also, on the rides where lines existed, workers were handing out numbered ""boarding passes."" My guess is that these were there to help discourage line-cutters (which I saw just once--on the Jet Stream ride). I also noticed a good security presence as well.We visited yesterday, 10/18/2013. Since we would only be spending one day at the park, we decided to go maximum-velocity and purchased the Platinum Flash Pass with Full Throttle add-on. This was likely overkill, since most of the rides were completely empty (except Full Throttle). Towards the end of the day we walked on most rides and rode some twice in a row. The kids area was totally vacant. We could have ridden every single ride in the park if we had wanted to.The rides were great! Some of the coasters were better than others (to each their own, of course), but all of them seemed to be in good upkeep. Our little guy especially loved the ball room in the kids' area, and the Apocalypse coaster. X2 was closed, as was the Rapids and Tidal Wave water rides. It seemed there were other areas that were closed due to the mazes for Fright Fest.The workers seemed enthusiastic and provided great customer service. Prices? Well, it's an amusement park. We didn't expect to find killer deals, but, coming from Alaska, I can see how paying $10 for small bowl of teriyaki would seem outrageous. For us, it was slightly higher than normal.We stayed until dark to see Fright Fest. We didn't do the mazes, but they looked pretty popular. The costumed characters were fun to watch, but it was a bit too intense for our little guy. My teenager BEGGED us to stay, but, alas, we had to head back to the hotel.All in all, it was a great visit! We will definitely visit again, if in the area ESPECIALLY during Fright Fest! However, I'm not sure a Platinum Flash Pass was worth the money we paid...",tgsapo
40,Fun day at fun park,"Good selection of thrill rides. The park was clean and well shaded. Had a friendly staff. As with all amusement parks, food was overpriced for the value; however, they did have some variety that I wish we had checked with. Overall it was a great day for our family.",KarenMom_2
40,"Thrills, thrills and chills!","My husband and I used to go to MM alot when we were ""younger"". Stopped going because it was going downhill and creeped us out. Then we had kids, so we decided our daughter needed to ride Colossus among others. She did get to ride it, backwards!! We had a great time at MM and were pleasantly surprised to find it much improved over the last time we went. Clean and well maintained. The rides, of course, are awesome!! She was thrilled with the different kinds, Goliath (big drop), Batman (hanging), Tatsu (looking at the ground), Riddlers Revenge (stand up), and the great new Full Throttle. It was busy, but it was Fall break in AZ, and the waits were long, but we thought the price for the Flashpass was pricey. Maybe why it seemed not many people used it? Food was pricey too, but luckily the portions were large and my daughter and I shared an entree. Nights were Fright Fest and we didn't go to the mazes as we had already done the Universal Halloween Horror Nights, but there were still scare zones, with zombies, big nosed scary guys, to give you a fright and a stage with a band and dancers. It got really cold after the sun went down, the rides were chilly. Would recommend and would defintiely go again. Lockers were available for a full day with multiple openings or at some attractions for $1 for 2 hours. MM does not want you to have loose items on the rides, all kinds of signage in queue. Tatsu has cubbies and most other rides you can leave bags on the other side of entry while you are on the ride.",dme3
50,"coasters, zombies, and service","I spent a wonderful fall day at six flags Magic Mountain with my wife and 3 daughters ages 10, 10, and 12. There were rides for everyone in the family from the mild to the NO Way!. Be warned that the big raft water ride is going to drench at least half of the people each ride so be prepared with extra clothes if it is cold out! We enjoyed a nice lunch and suggest the Tri Tip barbequed on site. This was our first visit to this Six Flags park and were pleasantly surprised by the customer service we received throughout the day. We were constantly being helped with directions, recommendations for rides, and where to eat lunch. We attended the Fright Fest in the evening and really enjoyed the variety of haunted mazes. There were fright zones with ghouls, zombies, werewolves etc. ready to jump out and startle you through the fog that was created throughout the park. Rest assured that if wearing a glow stick the beasts would leave you alone, but where is the fun in that. There was an additional charge of 13 dollars to go through the mazes, but with 8 of them throughout the park, it was well worth it. The scares were usually of the jump out and startle variety and they took it easy on gore and grossness which was OK with my kids. The highlight for this 50 year old guy was riding the two rollercoasters they had set up with the cars backwards for Fright Fest. This was a whole new way to enjoy the coasters for me. I highly recommend attending Fright Fest!",James K
40,Lots of Coasters,A lot of coasters for anyones enjoyment. I love the speed of the superman ride and feel it is a must. The lines are really long for being a smaller park than Disney and the food is expensive but it's still a fun place to try out.,Maryia D
50,Great Park and Great Rides,"My son and I had a fantastic time at this park We are roller coaster fanatics and the coasters did not disappoint. We bought the flash pass which reserve a spot in front of the line. A bit pricy but since we traveled from Wisconsin we made the purchase and were glad we did.Clean park and nice people. Overall, well worth the trip.",icma45

50,SFMM experience,"This park is absolutely great if you are here for thrill rides. So many rollercoasters in one place, wow! The only one I wasn't so enthused with was The Viper. Very jerky and if you're small like me, you may get your head jerked back and forth and hit within the safety harness. If it weren't so jerky, the ride would be good. The Riddler's Revenge was a very smooth coaster and if you lower and raise (standing ride) yourself at the right times it's even better! Tatsu is pretty crazy and you'll be screaming that's for sure! The X2 was closed for maintenance so we didn't get to ride that one. Also, don't forget Goliath, Full Throttle and Green Lantern, all very thrilling screamer rides. There are good family rides for the younger set that can't get on the bigger rides. Lots of walking so be sure to wear comfortable shoes. If you're there in the fall and later, be sure to bring a jacket as the weather gets nippy and you get cold waiting in line. The lines were fast moving and the ride attendants were very outgoing. We came during Fright Fest. Even though we didn't get to do that part, it looked like it would be a lot of fun. Lots of costumed characters abound along with Halloween creepy decor to set the mood and give you a little scare. They might be a little too scary for the little ones though. We came around 5 pm and rode about 10 rides. Some back to back since the line was short. There are a lot more than 10 so get there early if you plan on riding all the rides. They had skill games and the game attendants were pretty nice overall. The only complaint I would have is that the food is overpriced. We got two orders of Turkey leg dinners and one Tri-tip sandwich which cost $50! This didn't include the drink either! As we were about to leave the park we stopped in for the Funnel Cakes. They are so good and so big, but they cost between $9.99 to $11.99! We got three of them. This is too expensive for dessert, it really is! So for the food total, we spent $86 just on food! Other than th",Levada M
50,HAD A BLAST 2 TIMES THIS YEAR!!!!,"We went to Six Flags Magic Mountain twice this year and had the most amazing time. I would recomend it to everyone. My last visit was just me (68) and 4 of my teenage grandkids. We had so much fun there for 4 long and glorious days. Everything was perfect in the park. Parking is great and the walk is a little long, but buses are provided if you have the patience to wait for one. My teenagers dont' have any, so we walked! The rides are great and very breath taking. My favorite is Superman. I could ride it all day long. My grandkids keep asking me when we are going back??? Don't tell them but, I hope to very soon.",Ken V
50,Holloweekends = FUN TIMES!!!,"Annual fall roller coaster road trip - FUN TIMES!! We like to go during the Halloweekends/Frightfest. We're Six Flags Annual pass holders (actually membership which I recommend over the Annual Pass!!) plus have the parking endorsement. Parking is $20. I think food & drink prices are a bit steep.Visited on a Friday & the lines were pretty short - I think the longest was Ninja (45 minutes) because they were only running one train. We rode front seat of every ride - some even more than once! The new Full Throttle is a good one - plus with a tunnel surprise!! X2 & Collassus were both down - BUMMER!!!Beautiful fall California day! Park remains clean & family friendly. Lots of walking - up & down hill/steps (it is called Magic Mountain for a reason!!)Once the sun goes down the fun begins! There are a number of haunt zones throughout the park with creatures ""scaring"" guests - and then about 10 VERY SCARY mazes. Maze lines are VERY LONG!! Lots of Security prescence throughout the park (seemed to keep things under control).Fun time had by all!! Will be back again.",Debbie85614
10,Don't Drop Anything from Your Pocket,"My family was visiting from Australia (after visiting Disneyland and Universal Studios) and were excited about the rides following the reviews we had read.

Simply, fill out this form and we will contact you if we find it.......our hotel concierge phone this place for the next 3 days morning and afternoon and didn't even get a chance to leave a message on a machine. No answer anywhere. My son was devastated.

30,Overcrowded and not worth it at Halloween,"We have been here several times including twice at Halloween. We were so disappointed this year to find X 2 closed and every other coaster only running one car. This caused EVERY ride to become a one to three hour wait. We have always been pleased to get on most rides. This year we could only get on a few. Rather than pay for more lines for the mazes, we went to Knotts for the next day. Food was over cooked with small portions. Liked the refillable drink deal. The makeup on the performers in the scare zones was fantastic. Enjoyed the past years much more. Most likely will not return",Plookey

50,My Heart Skipped A Beat,"Great place to take young teenage kids and see the excitement they get from the fury of these supercoasters, had nothing like this when I was that age. I believe 2 of the rollercoasters are the fastest on the planet. If your kids love Rollercoasters this is the place to go. Lines are a little long but well worth it.",Steph K
10,Horrible customer service,Do not EVER leave your bag anywhere as the park has a KNOWN issue of people stealing. Some who have season passes just go to the park to steal. This is an issue the sheriff station is aware of but the park does not do anything about.I was very surprised at the service of the park as it was awful.,johnsonkendrae
50,"Thrill rides aplenty! If you like Roller Coasters, then this is your park.","My family and I went Friday, opening day of Fright Fest and had a great time and wait times were minimal except for Riddlers Revenge that was over an hour.BTW...wait times are at every theme park. Especially on weekends. Get used to it or plan ahead for a weekday. Wear comfortable shoes. For example, the following day we went to Disneyland and wait times for rides were between 80 mins for Space Mountain and up to 2 hours for CARS so by comparison, Friday at Magic Mountain had short waits AND the rides worth the wait.The difference being that you can acquire a Fast Pass for no charge at Disneyland to avoid long lines and at Six Flags a Flash Pass is purchased at additional hefty charge. Personally I refused to pay for that.Obviously one goes to Six Flags Magic Mountain for the RIDES! No John, it's not Disneyland as there is nothing at Disneyland that gives you the extreme thrills that you get from many of these Roller Coasters. We were disappointed that there were a number of rides closed for maintenance especially X2. (Disney had a few closed too)But with so many Roller Coasters to choose from made for an exciting day.The Zombies and ghouls walking the park and scaring the beejezus out of you were awesome and fun. Great for teens and older. And the mazes were spooky fun too.Food was very pricey. Reminds me of the Theaters...come in for the entertainment, get hosed for the food and drinks. Lockers were pricey too.But overall, if you are a thrill seeker looking for fast, exhilarating rides then this is your park.",Lana R

50,Fright Fest at Magic Mountain 2013,"We brought our kids to Fright Fest last year near the end of the month and it was insanely crowded. This time, we went opening weekend, and what a difference! We go mostly because we love rollercoasters and there were few lines, except on the newest rides or those running only 1 car. We didn't do any of the haunted mazes (extra fee and age requirement of 13 years) but enjoyed the street performers in the scare zones. My kids were a little apprehensive, but the ghouls were pretty friendly when they saw scared kids and would offer high fives or photo ops. Even though we go to Magic Mounatin all the time (season passes), the lack of crowds & the halloween fun made this one of our best trips ever.",Susan R

40,Great rides but crowds and wait time ruins the fun,"We went to six flag expecting amazing thrill rides and we weren't mistaken. The rides are great unfortunately the amount of people ruined all the fun. Since from September park in only open on weekends it gets crowded, or maybe we were just unlucky. We had to wait in line for an hour!! (yes, 1 hour) to ride every coaster (the most popular once). It was incredibly hot day and there is not enough protection against sun when you are queuing so few people have fainted.All in all rides are good but you don't really get to enjoy them if you have to wait an hour.",ania_graz
10,staff are unfriendly and unhelpful and almost nasty,"I am disgusted by my experience. The staff were nasty. Food was cold and hard and very over priced. It looked nothing like the pictures of what it was supposed to be. The lines were forever long, more than 2 hours for most rides.",shoequeen4

50,Better experience than Cedar Point,"Being raised in the midwest, it is common for us to hit up cedar point every year. Although Cedar point is great, the rides at Six Flags Magic Mountain are more unique. X2 is outta this world and there are no other roller coaster that are more extreme than it. Make sure to come to the park early and go to X2 as your first ride. The loading time for this ride is long and you dont want to ride 2-4 hours for this ride. Try to ride this for the second time if you can. Besides this ride, we also enjoyed Talon, superman and goliah. There are alot of stuff to do at this park but they seem to have something crazy every year.",xrage4200
30,A bit of a disappointment,"We are avid Florida fans and we decided whilst on the West Coast to give Disney and Universal a miss and try somewhere different and Six Flags seemed to fit the bill. Unfortunately it didn't live up to the standards of other parks.Even before we entered the park things were going wrong - the left hand entry lane (which we happened to be in) was closed but had only been coned off at the gate itself, and not at the entry to the lane, causing the queue to take twice as long as it should, much to the annoyance of many people in cars in the same position as us!The park itself was clean and neat, and perhaps was busier than normal possibly due to it being only open on weekends at this time of year?Queue jumping or 'place saving' seemed the norm, but the lack of staff numbers meant it was ignored, despite notices saying it wasn't allowed. Not good!Queue times were ridiculous especially for Full Throttle, and after queuing for 20 + mins and hardly moving, we then heard an announcement it had a fault! as the sign we were near said the queue time was 2 hours, we gave it up as a bad job and moved on!It wasn't much better on other rides, but wasn't helped by rides operating with empty seats and there being no real organisation when you finally got close to the ride entry itself. It was frustrating watching the rides being under-utilised almost every time, the worst culprit being Riddlers revenge. There seems to be no organisation at all for single riders. Another frustration!The Drop of Doom was a great ride but was soo slow getting onto it.Batman - a great ride.Superman - Escape from Krypton was an amazing ride again spoiled by queue jumping and disorganisation.And that was in - in almost 8 hours we managed only 4 rides which is poor by any standard. It WOULD help if the queues had some entertainment to distract you from the queue time, like TV's, music, etc - there Was some of this but nowhere near enough so it was BORING. Take a drive to Universal and Disney to see how its done, and sort out the ride entry to make sure every car is filled to capacity.This review may sound harsh, but you have some amazing rides which there was simply NO chance of getting on due to the time constraints which could have been easily improved with some simple changes. Six Flags could easily compete with the big boys but based on my experience, you have some way to go!",Pippin1960

40,Worth it by rollercoaster,"The rollercoaster are awesome! But the rows are very disorganized (those who have been at Disney will notice a huge difference).They don't have locker in all the attractions, so it is a problem if you go with bags, cameras, glasses, etc. - I recommend to use the locker in the entrance of the park (which is more expensive) and let your stuff there all day.The bathrooms were filthy, impossible to go!Is not allowed to get in with food.The access to some attractions are very difficult (super man)",Natalia_PMacedo

Went in on the Friday night to organise our Season Passes (glad we didn't leave it until the Saturday monring - the queue was very long). Also decided to ride X2 as the queue was only 1 hour and the hot sun was gone. We bought Platinum Flash Passes for the Saturday and it was money well spent. Rode 26 times that day. Favourite rides were Tatsu, Riddlers Revenge & Superman: Escape From Krypton. The park was very clean, there were plenty of people walking around picking up rubbish. We had no issues with other patrons (then again, we weren't lining up in queues for long) and the sushi we had was lovely.

20,Bittersweet,"My dad and I went to Six Flags on a weekend. It's pretty far away and is not easily accessible by public transport. That to me, has always been an important deciding factor- accessibility. The positives of the experience were:a) brilliant selection of high thrill rides. It will not leave you disappointed. Drops, spins, speed- it's got everything. And in plenty.b) The flash pass is interesting and useful. It's different from a front of the line/ express pass you take for most other theme parks. It's convenient. The gold flash pass is sufficient- you don't need the platinum onec) scenic and well maintained. Restrooms and water fountains are conveniently located.Having said this, there were a number of negatives:a) staff- They were absolutely useless. They looked terribly bored, disinterested and some of them were downright rude. But the most frustrating part is they were clueless for the most par. Guest relations devotes a maximum of one minute per person and barely understands your question in their rush to move on. Nobody knew where the rides were, how to get to them, anything about special accessibility -wheelchairs, strollers etc. Customer service is ZEROc) A lot of the rides require an additional fee and that destroys the purpose of purchasing an entrance ticket. Fortunately, Six flags is not very pricey, so that's ok.d) The WORST PARK MAP- completely misleading and confusing. It was a nightmare navigating with ite) It is exhausting to climb that mountainous terrain to reach all the rides on timee) They NEED SHUTTLES-All major good theme parks have some shuttle service from the nearest major public transport hub. A place like this, thats out nowhere needs it majorly.Six Flags Magic Mountain should NOT BE ATTENDED if you are faint hearted or have any back/ heart/ neck/ spine problem. The rudes rattle you and physically make you feel bruised and shattered. But the worst has to be the fact that a safety latch came undone in one ride and that is absolutely unacceptable. I rate this place high on what it has to offer but low on how it offers it",Wanderlustvani
40,NOT OLD-PEOPLE FRIENDLY!,"Visited Magic Mountain with two teenaged girls. Park was open from 10:30 a.m. until 6:30 p.m. on Saturday, 9/28/13. Arrived before park opened and girls took off on their own as soon as gates opened. My husband and I decided we would have a leisurely day walking around to see the sights and any shows offered at the park. WRONG! Magic Mountain is truly a MOUNTAIN walking uphill in some spots were pretty slow going. AND NO SHOWS to watch.We opted to dine for lunch at the Moosehead Lodge, a sit down restaurant that offered a buffet or items from a menu. Also a relief to be in a air-conditioned building on an extra warm fall day.After four hours in the park, I contacted my girls and said we were headed back to the hotel. I picked up the girls at the end of the day in the ""drop off/taxi area"" by the front exit. Worked out perfectly for all the parents waiting for the kids.So unless you are a BIG ROLLER COASTER FANATIC who enjoys BIG ROLLER COASTERS, I recommend dropping off your teens at the park and head over to the Westfield mall a mile away!",erin97mommy

30,Not disney! Dirty and annoying nosies,"Some of the rides are fun, the flash pass is great, but there are rides that are just too much, like the green lantern.

50,my day couldn't have been better,"from the time I arrive to pay my parking fee till the time I left, my day was fulfilled. We received great customer service.

Before arriving though I knew in my mind that I was going to enjoy myself and I seriously think that that also made a dfference.",Angela T
50,Fun for everyone,"Love the thrill and the park, will go back and plan to spred the word about how amazing the rides are.",jnramos2013

50,Most fun I've ever had!,"It was absolutely amazing! I love roller coasters so this was the park for me. We went on Thursday September 5, and there were very few lineups. We managed to ride almost everything we wanted to. One coaster was closed so that was a bit disappointing, but all the other coasters made up for it. The prices for water were expensive as I expected, but there were water fountains everywhere. Sometimes I just needed an ice cold water though. The temperature was nearly 40 degrees Celsius that day! Bring sunscreen! I felt safe on every ride, there were many safety checks in place. I will definitely go again if I can.",wpgtraveler
50,The biggest and best theme park I've been to!,"Man this place is sooo much fun! For both adults and kids! I was travelling alone and went to 6 flags magic mountain on my own with a goal to ride EVERYTHING. I paid for the platinum flash pass which is quite expensive, increasing the cost to 4 times that of a normal admission BUT I highly recommend this if you want to make the most out of your day. With the flash pass, I managed to skip around 90% of the wait times (some rides had a 2 hour wait) on all rides and it also allowed me to ride some of the rides twice without getting off the ride. At the end of the day I managed to ride all of the rides in the theme park with some returning at night time to check out the scenery at night (the Lex Luther drop).",jacklutrips
50,Fun for all!,"Our first trip to this park, and it was everything we ever hoped for. Fun for all! No one left disappointed. Even our youngest enjoyed the day. I LOVE ROLLER COASTERS!",Tahryn
50,Magic Mountain,"Rides, games, and attractions all in one place you must be thinking its Disney Land well you would be wrong all of these things you will find at Magic Mountain. This theme park is a place you would go if you love rides and I don’t mean small kid rides I mean roller coaster’s that are huge. This place has all of your carnival games that you love and great prizes to win from them too. So if you love riding roller coaster’s, watching shows, and playing games this is the place to be.There are many things to do here as there are over 100 rides, games, and attractions to ride, play, and watch. They have many roller coaster’s there most prized one Goliath which is the best as it has a 255 foot drop and trust me that’s pretty high. When you’re at the top of the drop the cars below you look like they are ants and to make it worst it pauses for a couple seconds and that really gets you excited as you go down it feels like your just falling out of the sky and that’s when it gets your stomach the most. But that’s not the only roller coaster they have many more with big drops just not that big. Besides the coasters there are many games you can play my personal favorite the basketball shooting one. After you have played some games and ridden the rides you want to they have shows you can go see and some of them are pretty amazing like animal shows those are the best. So you can do something all day and never get bored. If you do than your not trying to have fun.They also have many food places on the park but I would recommend eating off of the park. Every once and awhile they have deals for food but you know just like most food from a park the price is jacked up because it’s on the park. So there are some good deals but wouldn't recommend the food just because of the prices other wise it taste great.Theme parks are fun and this one goes up and above others it has lots of rides and games you can play. You could even take your kids because they have an entire area for kids. This place is great to go with family and friends you can play when you want ride rides when you want and go to shows if you want. Its an all around great place to go and have fun with family and friends.",Jeffery S
40,Six flags thrills and lines,We went on saturday and it was extremely hot. We had a family of two people actually riding and the other two walking around the park shooping. The lines were horrible at the BEGINNING ONLY. AFTER the lines get very fast depending on the rides. One example the Batman ride was close and opened with no line which made it possible for the other group to ride more to once. Tatsu on the other hand was a line of 3 hours that was well worth it for the party but still it was 3 hours! X2 was closed and a lot of people were dissapointed. The cup they sell for $16 is worth it because you can refill as many times as you want. It was a good experience!,PolethMont
10,cannot believe I reffered two friends,"I had a group of 4 people in which we all got season passes, I was appalled at hoe rude all the six flags associates were. From processing, to ride attendants, to the photography pick up. And how unpleasent all thr bees were. I am alergic to bees and they were at evrry single trashcan, in line, dinning areas, sitting areas. That was unpleasant for our group.",Rachel A
40,Great place for the big 'thrill' rides.,"We visited here as a family of four with teenagers whilst on holiday in L.A. It was our daughters' idea to visit as they enjoy the really big rides. We tried to arrive early as we knew as it was school holidays it would be busy. The car park was a good 10 minutes walk to the park entrance. We then had to have our bags searched and even though we had already bought a ticket we had to queue (for a good half an hour) to use it. All of this seemed to take about an hour. The queues to the most popular rides were over an hour long. (Which when temperatures were about 90F were tiring to stand in) . For big thrill rides I don't think you can beat it, avoiding school holidays if possible would avoid the big queues. One of the water rides was closed on the day we visited which was a shame and another closed whilst we were in the queue for it.The food was typical theme park food: burgers, Mexican, Chinese etc. The prices were a bit on the steep side, especially for drinks. Later on in the day there was a stage with a pop group and dancers on which were quite entertaining.I would have preferred relaxing in the Six Flags Hurricane Harbour (next to the park) but we went for the kids as they'd always wanted to go to one of the big American theme parks. If you do enjoy the big rides I would recommend it but otherwise Universal or Disney might be a better bet.",Karen G
50,Fun in the Sun,"I thought the rides were very fun, they had a lot of great little shops to look into, and plenty of places to eat. I ate at Mooseburger, we decided to eat there to escape the heat for awhile. It was okay, overpriced and slow. The rides when I was there was really short. The scenes in DC universe were really awesome. The Batman ride and the Scream were my faves. The only thing I advise, is be prepared! Drink lots of water, and expect to be a sweaty mess by the end. Also, most the park is an incline. Just a warning! All in all a fun day :)",Katie H
50,Great!,"Good place if you like adventure!!!! Rollercoasters that make adults become children!!! Haven't parking on shade. You must arrive when the park is opening and I'm sure that you'll go away when it close and you'll want stay a little more! The 'super man' is great! Choose dates that will not be vacation, the lines will be shorter...I love it!",JulianaGoeldner
50,A super fun place to take your family and friends.,I have been visiting the park since I arrived to this country and I definitely enjoy every single ride and the atmosphere offered during the holidays. The employees are very helpful and fun.,Patricia C
50,First time Visitor,"The rides at this park are the best I've ever ridden! As a young adult I'm all about finding the most daring and thrilling rides. Only thing I'd suggest to future visitors would be to purchase a fast pass if you can afford it! On the first day my family and I were there we waited a total of 6 hours in lines and were only able to ride 3 of the high thrill coasters! In the end the wait was completely worth it but with only having two days to spend there we didn't get to ride our favorites again because of the wait time. So fast pass I HIGHLY recommend. But overall the park was amazing, I'm already planning my next trip back!:)",Sabrina D

50,A rollercoaster enthusiasts dream,"Magic Mountain has the most rollercoasters in one theme park in anywhere in the world - and you'll know it once you're there. There are so many that even if you arrive in the off-season at the start of the day and leave right at the end, you're still going to struggle to go on them all. New ride Full Throttle is incredible; one of the best I've been on. But despite all the coasters, this is a very family-friendly park, moreso than other Six Flags I've been to. There's still a lot for the little ones to do. Food, too, is good, with a wide range of options, and there are lots of games and side attractions to enjoy.I'm normally the type to do a theme park in just one day, but this was a struggle. If it's possible for you to do so, do this over 2 days instead - a day and a half doing all the rides, with one half-day at the neighbouring waterpark.A word to the wise though - don't use the lockers provided for some rides to store your belongings. They're $1 for one use or $6 for one that moves around the park with you. But unlike Six Flags in New Jersey or Busch Gardens in Orlando, these aren't enforced. Every ride allows you to leave your bags in a safe location right next to the track instead, and there aren't even enough rides that use the (presumably old) locker system to justify the $6 price tag.",Scruff_UK
50,Just for Fun,Had a fantastic day with the grandchildren during summer break. The park was clean and the lines were small for the rides. gthe food was excellent and priced well.,Vicki2662
50,6 Flags was great !,"All the rides, food, entertainment, and games were all worth mine and familys money we had so much fun especially since we hardly go out as a family.",Lilyana T
10,Season passes useless at other water parks & parking,"I specifically went to the park to go to hurricane harbor and I had bought season passes in Maryland knowing that I was moving to the SoCal area and I was told that the season passes work at all the parks. I went to hurricane harbor and I was told I could not enter. I went to guest relations and they offered to transfer the season passes but only if I brought in the booklets that were given to me and they would take them. I just moved cross country and have no idea where all the booklets are nor do I even use them. I asked what could be done for that day and they told me that I would have to buy day passes at a ""discounted"" price (even though they just offered to exchange my season passes) at a price of over $120 for all 4 of us. I also had to pay $18 for parking even though I had parking on my passes. I immediately left the park and I am extremely dissatisfied with 6 flags. I wasted hours driving to your park and money for parking at your park just to get told I could not enter. Or that I'd have to spend more money to go in even though they had offered to exchange my passes. Now I will probably never go back to your park or even suggest going there.",Jesus C

40,Lots to see....so little time,Some very thrilling rides but you almost have to pay extra for the flash pass to ride several in a day.Lines were long and there is alot of walking and hiking up and down some steep hills or stairs.

40,"Great rides, great fun!","My friends and I had a blast. Awesome rides if you like to go fast and upside down! Food was high priced, but you expect that at an amusement park. Use your Discover card and everything was 10% off-- that was fantastic! Would definitely go back!",Blair B
50,Great day out,"I went with 2 friends (all in our late 20s). We bought a platinum flash pass, which was expensive but well worth the money - we skipped past all the lines, especially important since it was so hot! The rides were fantastic and the service was really good. Food was pretty average and expensive, but you don't expect much else at a theme park. Overall highly recommended!",SarahLNZ86
40,Holy Rollercoasters!!,"Wow! If you like thrills this is the place for you! Spend the day on some of the best rides around. Not for the faint of heart, there are choices, but most of them are pretty intense! Buy the all day drink cup.

Great day would definitely recommend",Chris91234
50,Best Six Flags!! Hands down,"I went to Magic Mountain last December and had an amazing time. You definitely need a Flash Pass in order to ride all the cool roller coasters, otherwise you'll spend precious time in line.X2, Tatsu, Green Lantern and Riddler's Revenge were my favorites. Viper, Colossus, Scream, Apocalypse were very cool too.Food is the same quality and price than any other park. I don't get why everyone complains about it. If it is expensive, then leave the park go to McDonalds and go back to the park. You'll waste 2 hours by doing so and you'll have to pay for parking again.Since I go there for the rides I d",jcisinthehouse
10,Nothing Magic Here,"In the past, I've had some great times at Six Flags Magic Mountain in Valencia. It does have by far the greatest collection on coasters in one location. The problem we experienced was getting on one.We were a party of 5, hit the park when it opened, made it to Revolution for our warm up ride then off to X-2. The sign said 30 min wait from this point when we entered. But an hour later we were still about 20 from the front. Then they stopped the line due to a mechanical issue and we waited another 40 minutes before they closed the ride for the day. No compensation like a fast pass for our next ride or anything.By that time the park was full, Roaring Rapids was over 2 hour wait time even though the sign said one hour. Ninja was a lot shorter, but they had everyone routed through the shaded pavilion into the sun where we baked for nearly an hour in 102 degree temps. (had they simply moved the chains around, everyone could have waited in the shade)Same for Goliath, sign said one hour, it took 2 and we saw people cutting the line and they did nothing.Four sandwiches for lunch for $66.00 was a way over the top. Bottom line, hot, long waits and only managed to get on six rides the entire day.",Custadvocate
40,Good Times with Teenagers...,"The park was really fun (we have season passes) but the lines were so long and people with the flash passes were not made to wait at any time. They would constantly let them in when the ride was only supposed to be a 15-30 minute wait and ended up being 1 1/2 hours. Too many flash passes. They should only offer soo many per day and Gold passes should be free.The only other thing would be to get the unlimited drink cups. We get 2-3 and then fill one or two with water and then a soda...Also, was there for 3 1/2 days in August and the water rides were closed... it was too hot to not open them....",tracyc35
50,Ride The Big Coasters,"If you are a person who wants non-stop Big Roller Coaster thrills all day long, then do not hesitate to travel to Los Angeles and travel ( by car ) North about 2 hours to Valencia right on the 5 Fwy to Six Flags Magic Mountain, you won't be sorry - AT ALL!!! And if you are the daring type, once you enter the park, head directly to Goliath and wait on line to get into the first car!!! I'm a Coaster rider who believes the biggest thrills are in the first car and not the last. Trust me, you won't be disappointed!!! And Goliath is just one of many super Big Coaster Rides, attractions, and entertainment at this park.",dartanion51
40,Family fun in the Sun,Our family had an awesome time at this amusement park. It's great for young children. My son (8 yrs) had a blast. He was able to ride almost everything in the park. Compared to Univeral Studio's I say Six Flags is definitely the place for family fun in the sun.,Savinaht
50,wonderful day!!,"wear comfortable shoes and clothes. we had a really great time and the wait time wasn't bad at all. We did the souvenir cups( a definite must) it saves a lot of money because when your walking the park all day you drink more plus, they are easy to carry because the cup has a handle.",Shelby Swenson
50,I love rollercoasters,"Constantly adding more coasters and updating older ones. There are some older ones that they keep for nostalgia, but still fun. There used to be problems in the park but they have invested and upgraded things and is cleaner and feels not so grungy. The lines are getting longer and longer so it has become popular again.",Eric H
50,The best theme park!!,Perhaps saying the best theme park is mainly due to no queues when we went. It was incredible! We went with our 3 teenage sons who went on their favourite rides at least twice because we didn't have to queue! It was the last week of the park opening during the week however! Many years ago I came to this theme park on a peak weekend and left after a couple of hours due to the very long lines for each ride. I didn't think there was much for younger children here but it was perfect for my sons. They love roller coasters and said they were amazing. As with a lot of theme parks it's a good idea to buy the souvenir cup and get unlimited drinks. Yes the food wasn't cheap but what theme park does do cheap food.,Cornishmaid2017
50,Mehhh,"Park was slammed, so by paying 3X the entry fee per person we got to bypass lines via the Flash Pass. I got the Platinum pass which allowed us to cut down on the line time. We rode 10 rides in 4 hours and bailed due to the humidity etc.",IluvDAredsox
50,So much fun!!!,I would say definitely get the souvenir cup. It's worth it! Wear comfortable shoes. Best place to eat in my opinion is Mooseburger Lodge.,Tiffany V
10,More money=less fun and they don't even care.,"Bummer of a day yesterday: Line for food was 3 hours (can't take your own), and I was behind only about 10-15 people. No kidding. Burnt! Our flash passes stopped working before 6:00. So now I've wasted 4 hours on those green bands. What an absolute waste. We bought pictures on the way out, but couldn't get different pix on different keychains. The young lady explained it kindly enough...then, she says something under her breath to the other guy in the booth and they both crack up, look at me and my daughter. Wow, more money, less fun. NOT your best, Six Flags! BTW, I tried to submit an under 500 character msg about this to 6Flags Customer Service, but at the end I get an ""Oops, couldn't load! Sorry!"" error message. Wow, can't you get it right?",Chuck A
40,Perfect for thrill seekers!,"No end of great rides to suit all! I went in October 2012 at the same time the park was hosting its annual Halloween celebrations. Unfortunately I didn't stop late enough for the scare mazes however the whole park was covered in spooky decorations and the place looked great!I also purchased the line skipping feature they offer to beat the wait times... After shelling out around $100 give or take, It was then and only then I realized how short the ride wait times were that day! I could have done the whole park without paying the extra in nearly the same time!Its a great feature and I imagine its a life saver in the summer, however I would advise you check the wait times before purchasing one of these passes.The only other issue I had was the one ride I really wanted to go on (Superman) was shut all day! With traveling all the way from the UK I wasn't too happy!Overall I had a great day though a would definitely recommend the park to everyone!",Alexander F
40,A must for all roller coaster freaks,"ok be forwarned, there is pretty tight security so dont have a small knive like me attached to your keychain otherwise you walk it back to your car which was not anywhere close.Once inside the fast pass to get in front is the way to go if you don't want to spend your day standing in line. Great rides lots of fun, but the food options are not so great.A must see for sure when in the LA area",Internationalgotoguy

The whole day we only got to ride on 5 coasters though, but I'm sure off-peak you'll be able to ride all!!!! I want to go back already!",trizzia710
40,Good Visit with the family,"It's 4 stars because the park has some really cool rides, especially thrill rides with all the coasters. The food is not too good at all however. I've been to other six flags such as Six Flags Over Texas and that one was a 5 star because it was a bit cleaner than this one and the food was much better. The staff members don't put forth the necessary effort at times like they do at Disney. But this one will be a fun filled day should you choose to visit. We did 3 days at Disneyland, one day at Knotts and 1 day at Universal Studios. Disneyland was #1, Universal Studios was 2nd and Six Flags was a close 3rd. If you plan to do all these parks while vacationing, I'd do this park prior to doing Disney, save the best for last",DisneyBeachLasVegas
40,Great theme park,And almost in our back yard! Took my 14 year old daughter and her friend to this park as a last Hoorah before school starts. Probably the best part of the experience is that there were no lines for the rides as most of the schools in the LA area already started. I'm not a big fan of the park crowds (or waiting in a line for 1.5 hours to ride something for 30 seconds) so I have to say this was a great experience for us. Only complaint is the noise from the Superman ride. Way to loud when on the ground anywhere around or under it. Even the park staff kept covering their ears.,Jim S

50,The best roller coasters in California!,"Every visit to Six Flags Magic Mountain is a great one. This one was no different. The hours were shorter than usual, probably because kids had started to go back to school. In any case it wasn't too crowded and with the Gold Flash Pass for 3 my son, his friend and I managed to go on all the big rides in the 10:30am to 6pm timeframe. I highly recommend this park for teens and thrill seeking adults. There is a small section for the little kids but most of the rides are geared towards older kids and adults. Get the flash pass it is worth it and once you add the price of admission to that of the fast pass you end up in the neighborhood of the price of entrance alone at Disneyland.",leendawoman
50,So Psyched,"Being a roller coaster junk head, I can't help but love this park. It has all the thrills a person who shares my feelings would enjoy. The rides are right up my alley. I like how I get nervous waiting in line. The Parks employees are willing to help if need be and they'll even joke with you playfully if time allows. The ones that are on their break will even help you as much as they can without getting into trouble for working on their break. The food could be better to match with the prices, so we usually choose Jonny Rockets or Panda Express. Overall, the park is awesome! I also learned to visit the park while kids are in school during the early Spring and Summer days.",Veronique S
50,Stress Reliever,Six Flags my favorite place to forget about my problems and release my stress ...this is a great place to come and enjoy with the family and friends its a big place so always take your comfortable shoes. Fun place to take pics with all the different caracters and the nice views. Nobody likes making long lines but the rides are worth the wait. I wish I can go every week at least ^.^ .,Iris G
30,Every 15 years whether you need to or not,"Everyone should go here every 15 years whether they need to or not. Just to see how little it has changed and how run down it gets. It's been 20 years since I last went and they had 4 new roller coasters. My kids liked it. I thought it was just OK. Lacks theme, excitement or any interest in general but it has some BIG roller coasters and that's what matter and they know it. Buy your tickets online to save $20 off the at door price. If you get there in the morning go to the right instead of left like 3/4 of the people do you'll be going against the crowd and consequently avoid a lot of long wait times. A couple of the new coasters had hour waits all day, it didn't matter what time you went to them. So if you want to ride those just get in line.",sublime99

40,Excellent rides but awful food,There are so many rides to choose from - we did most of them. We bought a flash pass - without it we could not have done as many rides so well worth it. Food options were generally awful. Expensive and tasteless food. More healthy options needed!,Cecilie S
20,A real money squeezer,"We were looking forward to go to this park with the kids and we purchased the tickets ahead of time. My sone wanted especially to do the new Full throttle. Considering to go to such a park is a big cost for a family who travels around the US from Europe, we purchased some drinks and snacks before going to the park. At the entrance we found out we were not allowed to bring any food or drinks and we had to throw away everything because they did not even have a place to possibly store it!! And lockers inside the park are also charged! I find this indecent because they clearly try to squeeze as much money out of you as they can, and this is a disgrace with respect to people they got nothing to eat. Disneyland is not like that. Once entered the park, we even found out we would have had a good discount if we had given an empty COCA can. Nobody told us that. I was really upset and if it had not been for the kids I would have left right away. Once entered the park, there are a lot of great attractions, but in a full day you can do more or less 5 attractions unless they squeeze you even more money for a fast pass. Overall, if you think of 5 attraction with an average of 2 minutes per ride, the day (park is open from 10:30 until 8:30 PM) will be 9 hours and 50 minutes waiting and 10 minutes ride. For such a deal they could be more understanding for their clients and not do what explained before. Conclusion: great attractions, but it has been the first and LAST time I will go",Stefano S
50,It's more fun with Friends.,"The roller coasters are great, if you can get on most of them. I recommend the Flash Pass, so worth the money. The food is quite disappointing but oh well, the only good part is Johnny Rockets and the Pizza.",Johnnii
50,magic mountain is so awesome!,Have a good nights rest before the big day. Make sure you are ready for a full days worth of Fun! Highly recommended to purchase the refillable soda drinks. And you must go to batman area to try the pizza. Go with comfortable clothes and shoes. Don't forget you camera for unforgettable memories!,Irma R
50,More coasters than you can ride in a day without suffering brain damage.,"This park is so packed with coasters, you'll want to spend two days. I can't say that about any other park I've visited.",senioreeter
50,Magic Mountain,"Our family of teens had alot of fun at Magic Mountain this past weekend. The rides are geared towards the teen and adult ages which makes it more fun for my family. And I was really impressed with how they make the wait in line comfortable by providing chade, misters and TV entertainment.",Tour13611
30,Park is showing its age.,"We should have gone to this park first before Universal - then we wouldn't spend the day comparing the two. The park is okay if you are there JUST for the thrill rides. We had a sandwhich at the Cyber Cafe which was soggy and terrible. A very expensive day, indeed. Fast track pass in not worth it - only the 2 popular rollercoasters had really long lines. Everything else was reasonable.",Heather M
50,awesome,our trip to the park was incredible the lines were pretty short and super intense. I would recommend this park to anyone who likes thrills or even some mellow rides,Oved F

50,Best Rides on the West coast!!,"We took a long weekend, traveling from AZ, and spent Full days at the park. The parking was $18 over the price of tickets, but seems to be the standard at CA parks. Our kids are 10 & 12, tall enough for all the rides, which is a plus. All the roller coasters were Awesome, especially Goliath. We didn't get on Full Throttle, line was too long, Superman was my favorite and Batman was good, but we waited over an hour...not sure we'd do the same next time. If you have extra time and extra money the waterpark also looked fun, but we stuck with the coasters:) Happy Riding!",hjclimber
50,Bring it on!!!,"What an awesome park. We have season passes to Six Flags Over Texas, so we got in free at Magic Mountain.I thought the rides at the Texas park were extreme....nope Magic Mountain has them beat. We had an awesome time. There was a roller coaster where you lay on your stomach! There was a roller coaster where you stand up (get in the front row for an amazing ride)!!!The workers were great. The park was clean. The food was average at best...it's a theme park, not a food park.",jneuzil
40,For those with disabilities,"I brought my daughter and 2 other friends to Magic Mtn. I am disabled, but am able to walk without a wheelchair.There is plenty of handicapped parking, however, the walk to tram can be quite far depending on where your handicapped parking space is.Upon entering the park, the ""turn-styles"" are nothing but difficult for someone with a disability or someone who is over-weight. I saw many adults and even kids who were over-weight having a hard time maneuvering thru the turn-styles. I even made a comment to the employee and she said that ""everyone seems to have problems going thru this. They need to make them (the turnstyles) bigger"". I would have to say that those turnstyles are probably a foot in width. Many people's hips can barely get thru it, let alone with someone who has a disability and having to go ""sideways"" thru the turnstyles, etc.",C Y
50,Mecca for white knuckle rides,"If you like rollercoasters then this is your place! Highest, fastest, longest, most loops, they have them all.Cannot remember the names of the rides which I actually went on, but suffice to say they left my head spinning.Queue times varied from no queue through to a published 90 minutes, although that was typically only 45 in reality.A couple of rides like the wooden coaster were closed and which was a disappointment but there was still plenty to do (and plenty on which there was no chance I would go on)Only downside was the weather which was 110 degrees and which made walking around and standing in queues uncomfortable.",Gunner706
50,Amazing,"Magic Mountain was very fun. They have rides for everyone roller coasters,water rides and more! It's good to bring sunscreen and running/walking shoes. You'll have an amazing time!!!",Kayla C
50,Best park,This is the best park in the world. They have world class rides and a must do attraction while in Southern California.,David N
40,"Perfect for teens & adults, but pricey!","Great place for anyone that loves roller coasters! It's very pricey, but the flash passes are worth it. You have to purchase the regular park pass first, then you can choose a Flash Pass option. We bought the Platinum pkg. online before we arrived & even just getting that taken care of inside the park took awhile. We did get to bypass ticket lines to get inside the park & if you buy at least 3 days in advance it was a lot cheaper online. We had 3 teens and we were able to get thru all the rides in a day & even rode most of them twice in a row, which the people waiting in line didn't appreciate, but that's how it works! This pass gives you the opportunity to re-ride the rides and no waiting or a very slight wait for all rides. We went in July during the week, it was hot and humid and the price of the pass was worth not standing in line for the popular rides for 2hrs or more. During the week in the summer is a bit less crowded. There are plenty of hotels nearby & the city provides a shuttle to & from the park for free. We didn't use the shuttle simply because there are not any return shuttles until close to park closing & we didn't want to get stuck there all day if we needed to leave before then. We were only there for 6 hrs & the kids had a blast and loved being able to ride immediately and rode all the rides in that time. I don't recommend this park for young kids, you won't get your money's worth out of it for them, not many rides for them.",KCowanAZ
50,Magic Mountain Rules,"If you have small kids then Disneyland is fine. Other than that Magic Mountain rules. Cheaper, better and thrill rides trump Disneyland. This is a no brainer. Go to Magic Mountain. However if you have spicey Kung Pau at Panda Express and than ride X2 and Viper 5 times you'll probably need to hurry down to the restroom asap. But it was worth it :)",Dalton P
50,fear be gone,"If you have any fears to overcome this park will help you confront them, The coasters are amazing, by the time your done the word ""timid"" will not be in your dictionary. This is like a safe theme park without all the tame constraints, a place that has the benefits of a carnival with none of the drawbacks, It has a great atmosphere and the thrills are fully delivered.",William W
50,"GREAT PARK, GREAT FUN, EXPENSIVE FOOD",This is a fun filled park that will keep you entertained the entire time you are there. Lots of thrilling rides and a friendly staff. The only downfall was expensive food and drinks and dirty bathrooms.,Billy B
50,Family Fun,"My brother and his daughters (ages 9 and 7) have season passes to Six Flags Over Texas, so they decided to use them to visit Magic Mountain when they came to visit me in California. We had an absolute ball! I was very impressed with the number of rides that we could all enjoy together, even with our range in ages. There were plenty of rides that my younger niece could enjoy with the rest of us, which I thought might not be the case. The park was exceptionally clean too. And the food, although pricey (what theme park food isn't?), was delicious. We shared a family meal combo consisting of pizza and drinks, and everyone was satisfied. All in all, it was a great experience.",Rodney H
40,Not open long enough!!,"Went yesterday , the park is great but simply not open long enough ! 10.30 till 18.00. We bought regular fast passes and by the time you'd seen the video and put your ID down as a deposit it only left 7 hours in the actual park . The regular flash pass doesn't include full throttle and x2 , which are 2 of the best rides. We decided to queue for full throttle and use the flash pass to 'virtually queue' for another coaster . It worked pretty well , but be warned , later in the day the queue times on the flash pass reached over an hour ! You basically queue in line for one ride and at the same time use your pass to do the same on another one. Universal fast past is so much better !! I'd advise getting at least the next grade up as it offers 50% reduced waiting time on the ride your using your flash pass for , but how much extra should you really pay just to actual attempt to get on the rides after paying quite a hefty entrance fee ???Sounds like a moan , but as I said the rides are first class , just be ready to run around like a maniac trying to fit them in ( I would not bother without a flash pass!!) .in the end we missed out on about half the rides including Goliath, x2 and viper , that was with the regular flash pass . Use the map well , try and not book into a ride the other side of the park as there are a few steep climbs and remember that clock is ticking down !!!!!",Palaceboy0
20,Strange policy,"We visited both Six Flag's parks in Valencia, California. You must be aware of the Park policy not to allow any entry of food or drink (apart from water) to the park. For us it was quite an unpleasant surprise to reach the gate and to be requested to through away (or to go back and to leave it in your car….) whatever you brought. When we purchased our tickets in advanced, we could not see any notice with this regard so be aware of it. Apart from that, we think that in order to enjoy the park you must have a Flash Pass card, otherwise you will wait in line a lot of your time. transportation from and to the park from the parking area can be better and more often and they must make sure that all rides in the different attractions are full. This is not all the time happened which make your waiting time even longer. Before publishing my review I sent the management a separate survey and review but got no response. Maybe to this one they will answer.",Micky G
30,It's not Universal Studio,"So maybe it was a mistake coming here after going to Universal Studios. The park had lots and lots of rides but the area they were spaced out over made it very difficult for us as we had our young ones with us.The Bugs Bunny World was a hoot for my daughter, and we really enjoyed the Big Drop and the roller coasters. You seriously need two days to do everything comfortably.",Sara H
50,awesome theme park,you can do a lot here and it is very inexpensive and its also very fun. good for families couples and etc you wont regret it,Edgar G
50,Six flags,It was hot in the mild of the day when I got there but the park did a very good job of keeping the guest cool whole waiting in line for the rides. Great funnel cakes. For the most part clean. Has areas that need some work but overall I'd go back and take friends along. Good day out!,Brittany B
10,Not a Place for Fat People If you want to get on the Rides,"Just your average overweight American, 6' 321lbs 50-48' waist and chest. Just don't fit. Would have been nice to know before I bought the tickets. Nothing wrong with not being able to fit, just needed to know the dimensions. Could have save me several hours of going from ride to ride and being told that i may fit over on this other ride. Total goose chase, and no refunds!",Bob D
50,I LOVE SIXFLAGS,"I love Six Flags. It is one of the best theme parks I have ever been to. The first time I ever went to Six Flags was in middle school. As soon as I we got there and I saw the rides I was thinking in my head, this is going to be amazing. What do you know, after the first time going I fell in love with Six Flags. It is my favirite theme park and always will be. I honestly prefer going to Six Flags than any other theme parks. I recommend people to go.",Guillermo B
50,Lots of Coasters,"We tagged on a day at Six Flags while we visited Disneyland. Our 15/16 year olds, now say Six Flags is their favorite park. In our rental car on a Saturday it took us TWO hours to get the the park. A Gold Flash pass was all you needed to get on most of the rides.We thought the park was great value for money.Two hints,1) Buy and print your gate fees online you save money.2) buy one Flash Pass then you can add upto 5 people on to the device.3) You can't bring in outside food",Faye W
50,Expensive,A good place to go aFor the summer to cool if you visit the water attractions. for visitor for visitors of teenage early 20 age range there's lots of fast food funnel cakes pizza hot dogs chips and nachos soda cotton candy candy apples. There are some attractions for children. There are only a few rice for children and it is not for people who are unable to walk long distances it is crowded and hot with lots of c everything is overprice. The trinkets break easily and are not worth the money you pay they are of Dollar Tree quality . & value however the rides are fun and it makes it all worth the while.,Toccara
50,Value for money,Great park offering over 18 thrill rides. Queues can get long therefore the earlier you get tot the park the better and have a plan as to what rides you want to do first and keep to this route where possible. Parking is expensive as is eating inside the park but there are eating place just a 10 minute walk away which offer lunch deals Mon-Fri,Ann G

50,Best Place for Riding the Roller Coasters!,"We've been to Magic Mountain several times now. If you love to ride fast, thrilling roller coasters, this is the place to go. We went on August 16 this year, and for some reason the crowds were really low and lines were short. Maybe the California students were already back in school? Whatever the reason, it was a great time to go. Typically when we go, we always buy the Fast Pass. They have two different types, and be warned: they're expensive! If you're like us, and this was a destination all in itself, then that's not a big deal, but if you come more than once a year, it's probably not worth it. The Gold Fast Pass gets you onto the rides in about half the time, and the Platinum Fast Pass is supposed to cut the line by 90 percent, as well as give you wrist bands that let you ride twice in a row. The real reason for us to get the Platinum Fast Pass, though, was that if you buy it, you can also purchase (for even more money - $15 extra per person per ride), a reservation on the new roller coaster, Full Throttle. With a Gold, you can only reserve on X2, and not on Full Throttle (again, look at the website, this may change, as it's changed every time we've come to MM).On this particular day, we really didn't even need a Flash Pass because the lines were quite short at most of the rides. X2 and Full Throttle had long lines (as expected), Apocalypse was closed (bummer!), Roaring Rapids had a bit of a line, and Scream had a bit of a line. Several of the rides were literally just walk on, like Ninja, Revolution, Colossus, and, since we hit Viper right after the park opened, Viper, but we don't know how it was later in the day.We typically like to eat the pizza that's found about halfway thru the park if you're doing it in order in a circle, near the top of the park on the map. It's pretty good for park food. Most of the rides don't let you take anything on them, so we just get an all day locker at the front of the park and put our stuff in there for the day, with credit cards and cash in our pockets.The only difficult thing about our trip here was the 100 degree weather. It's been hot in the past, but I don't remember it ever getting over 100. We bought plenty of $4 waters! Not much you can do about that. Some people clearly like the big sodas with the refills, but unless you're willing to get a locker at every ride or leave them on the side of the ride (which I would never do; I once saw a guy at a concert who grabbed anybody's drink and drink it) I don't think they're worth the hassle.We like to stay at the Hilton Garden Inn, which is right at the base of Magic Mountain. When you're completely exhausted from walking up and down that mountain all day, it's nice to just go chill at a hotel that's very, very close. It's a nice, clean hotel with pretty big rooms, a desk, wi-fi, and pretty comfortable beds. Of course, after a day at Magic Mountain, you'll probably sleep great anywhere!For dinner, we typically just walk over to the Marie Callendars just because it's walking distance, but the other night we made a real find - the Rustic Eatery, which also very close to Magic Mountain and has great food.Magic Mountain is just a super fun day!",LuraV
30,Six Flags,"Not great. Up to 2 hours waiting for rides despite spending 400 dollars on ""platinum passes"". Flash Pass is very expensive and did not work as advertised. Not so many places to sit and get some cover from the sun and heat. Rides are good but you need to be ready to put up with the long waiting time and the unprofessional staff.",Mach78
50,Great time,Perfect for family days! We had a blast. It was great seeing all our pictures from the rides and being able to pick them out and take one home (although it was pricey) If you can get past the prices it is a great time!,Tasha W
40,"Splashingly, refreshingly, roaringly great time!","This park has really come up in many areas such as the attractions and rides. The food is actually very good, as well, with The Mooseburger Lodge leading the pack as far as a fun, entertaining, enjoyable restaurant. This park has to work on a few things to really give the visitors the ultimate in their visit. These are very simple things to resolve: 1. Please make sure that you have MORE ATMs and ATMs that work! There was (literally) only 1 in the main souvenir shop that worked!!If you want teens to play games, you gotta given them a way to pay with cash. We went to no less than 5 different ATMs and NONE worked until the end of our visit and back at the front of the park. The park missed out on $100 in revenue on that. 2. Please do NOT close the frozen yogurt/Dole Whip stand near the Superman ride just an hour before park closing. (Have you seen the Disneyland ride ""Tiki Room"" where they serve this treat? There is ALWAYS a line into Frontierland like no other. Again, $100 easily from our group would have been made!) Seriously, what vendor does this?!3. Please fix the harnessing/seats at The Green Lantern ride. That ride throws the rider in their seat front and back and it is painful. These need to hold the rider in place as the ride throws the rider enough as it is. (And this from a daredevil, ride anything kind of person!) Other than that, GREAT PARK!!!!",Veronica S

30,Fun,"We were at Magic Mountain a few weeks ago with my hubby, three kids( 5,10,12), 6 y o nephew, my mom, and niece and her boyfriend. It was fun and not horribly crowded since it was mid week. Lots of shade which was a huge plus since my mom was with us and doesnt do well in the heat( it was 90 the day we were there). Very clean and friendlyShort lines for the kiddie rides and not as popular rides. Our 12 year old went on the big roller coasters with her 19 year old cousin and the wait was around an hour for each one.The worst part was the food...Terrible and very expensive!!!!!!!! Over $100 for chicken fingers and fries that were dried and tasteless!Would I go again? Maybe...if you like roller coasters then this is the place for you...",COcrazyhouseof5

We went to six flags with our two kids 11&12 and had a fantastic time, our only regret was not getting to ride all the maximum thrill rides. If you are into roller coasters go to this park.

30,Second time - different opinion,"Ok, I could not wait to return after my last visit.... I was there before the Gates opened ready to get to the fast pass that I reviewed before - made it into the first group- then the computers went down.

20,I would advise not to STAY AWAY from this one,"I found this park to be very disappointing. If you have been to other amusement 0parks, you notice that this park is not well kept, flowers are lacking or in need of care, benches are scarce and scattered throughout, leaving you to sit on hard rocks or on the floor. There is nothing to do if you are a none rider and what INFURIATES me the most about this park is that if you want to ride the new ride, you are required to buy the top-of-the-line Platinum Flash Pass ($105) plus pay an extra $15. RIDICULOUS! On top of that, the Flash Pass doesn't work for all rides and wasn't even that fast when you used it.As an experience park goer, I would recommend to STAY AWAY from this one.",Cynderella43
10,Would not recommend,"I have been going to SFMM for years and have never had a problem like this. Someone stole my wifes purse and everyone's attitude was ""Oh well.""

50,Must do....Especially if you are a roller coaster enthusiast!,"Being from the Chicago area, Six Flags Great America, is one of the amusement parks that we visit. When my niece and I came out to LA, Six Flags Magic Mountain was something that she wanted to do. We both have seasons passes, so it wasn't going to cost us as much as it would for those who do not have passes. Our passes WERE not good at their Hurricane Harbor and my niece's dining pass was not good at their amusement park, either. Those were the only negatives! The park is beautifully themed and landscaped. They have terrific roller coasters...and we went on most of them. We visited on a Sunday and felt that the park itself was not crowded...and the longest wait in line for a roller coaster was 45 minutes. Most of the queue lines were shaded...there was a breeze....so the wait in line was not horrific. The staff at the park were EXTREMELY polite and very helpful......to be honest, I enjoyed my visit to this park so much more than my recent visits to the park in Gurnee, Illinois. We left the park at 9:00 pm with so many great memories! We did not visit or do any of the kid's rides/areas as my niece is 13.",Mary S
50,six flags was fun,My friends and I went and we all had a very good time. The new rides were very cool. We are planning on going back.,Nick R
50,Flash Pass a must!,"We spent a Saturday at Six Flags and it was fantastic. Parking was $18 for the day which we thought was pretty expensive. We purchased a Flash Pass when we were in the park as it was extremely busy. These are pretty pricey (we purchased a Platinum Pass which was $105). This pass was 90% faster than queuing and it also allowed you to ride the same ride twice (straight away) if you wanted to. Most of the rides had queues of at least 60-90 mins. One of the rides had a wait of over 2 hours. Then only downside was the two newest rides weren't included on your flash pass and if you wanted them you had to pay a further $15 per ride. We thought this was crazy considering the park ticket price, the flash pass price and then asking for more money!! We didn't pay for these rides or wait in the long queues. The park itself is huge. It is very clean and there was a large selection of food outlets. They were expensive but that's typical of theme parks. Overall a great day, a fantastic park with thrilling rides.",Stell_Stu
30,"Fun for teens/young adults, not so much for others","I have lived in San Diego 20 years, but this was my first visit to Magic Mountain. Having to drive through LA to get to it was not an exciting thought. But we did (3.5h drive) and my kids 14 and 19 did a myriad of rides. I have a neck problem so avoided extreme rides, but I did do a couple of the not so extreme roller coasters (revolution and Collosus and gold rush) and found them fun, but nothing to rave about. However, even the extreme rides taxed the teens and made their head spin, so they didn't even want to do all of them. I do wish they had some entertainment type of shows besides just an OK band playing so my wife and I could do something while waiting for the kids. Food is very expensive, much more so than sea world or Disney, or so I remember, not having been to either park for a couple of years now.",Mitch D
20,Don't waste your money on a Flash Pass!,"My husband and I went to spend a day together. We decided to get the PLATINUM Flash Pass. We were guaranteed we would only have to wait 10% or less of the wait time and double rides. This was a Thursday and they said it wasn't a very busy day for them. We bought the pass and weren't impressed that after spending almost $200 X2 and Full Throttle were not included. We went straight to the Viper after getting our passes and greeted a lady with a younger daughter at the bottom of the ride. When we got up through the flash pass lane we were merged in with the people who didn't have flash passes and told to go to the first row lane. The lady we greeted at the bottom without a flash pass rode before we even got a chance. It was a 15 min. wait for regular and it took us 26 mins. to be able to ride. We told the guy we were riding twice and after we got back in from the ride he told us we couldn't in the first row. He was very rude telling us to get off the ride. We were not impressed so decided to go to the Flash pass building and talk to a manager (Joshua Davis). Where we were informed that if we wanted to get the most out of our flash passes we needed to go to the older rides at the other side of the park. He also told us if we kept having problems to come back and let him know. Ride after ride we were shoved, merged and told to go to the back of the line. They made us wait for the gold flash pass members (one below the platinum) time to get on the ride. All but one ride makes you merge into lines with everyone and that was the Ninja. The staff was very rude to us when we wanted to ride a second time even though we had wristbands and paid for double rides. It was a miserable day. We went back to inform Mr. Davis on our day like he had asked and he wasn't there. The other manager offered to let us ride X2, but after the miserable day we just wanted to leave. Never again will we go to Six Flags... Everything is overpriced and you have to pay for lockers at each ride! Also, if you want to pay to ride X2 or Full Throttle with the flash pass you have to pay an extra $15 per person, per roller coaster, per ride! We've never had problems at Knott's, so we will definitely choose Knott's Berry Farm or Disneyland next time!",Amber S

50,Best roller coasters on the West Coast,"I recently visited Magic Mountain on a trip to SoCal in July. My wife and I had other places to visit, so we only spent one full day at the park. We arrived when the gates opened at 10:30 a.m. and stayed until about 3:30 p.m.During that time, we rode X2, Tatsu (twice), Goliath, Full Throttle, Scream, Superman (twice), Apocalypse (twice), Green Lantern, Batman and Gold Rusher. We have been to SFMM before and skipped some other coasters.We used a regular Flash Pass, which was perfect on this day because the park wasn't really that busy. We never waited longer than 30 minutes (X2) and that one isn't included in the Flash Pass. Some of the lines were definitely close to an hour, but with the FP, we got on everything pretty quick, especially Superman and Apocalypse, which is why we rode them twice.Twice there were no attendees at the FP gate, so we basically just cut in line (legit because we DID have a FP) and I just manually cancelled the line reservation when we were getting on the ride. Honestly, it's kind of poor set up by the park, but I did not see anyone cut that didn't have a FP on them.The park food is mediocre. We were hungry and ate some fish and chips. Pretty normal stuff, nothing great. They did have a sushi bar with chefs in the indoor building, but we didn't feel like sushi. Prices were high, like the are in almost every theme park.One thing about SFMM is the employees don't really go out of the way to help and there seems to be a bare minimum of people on hand to run things. Most of the lines are run by themselves and I see empty seats. Lines would be cut down if they had single rider lines and someone moving people along in the loading platform. It is nice to choose your own row, but irritating when you are not waiting extra for the first or last row, but instead are in row 4 and two cars up there are open seats in rows 5, 7 and 8.For the most part, the crowds at SFMM are teens and young adults. There are a few adult coaster enthusiasts there, but I would say be prepared for a bit of vulgar language and the type of behavior that crowd is used to. I had no problems with anyone, but definitely heard some swearing. Just something to keep in mind. I never witnessed anyone being incredibly rude or mean, but kids like to act cool around their peers.The price of admission I think is very reasonable and they always seem to have offers. We bought our tickets more than 3 days in advance online and it was less than $100 for two people (about 1/3 the price of Disneyland) and about the same as Knott's Berry Farm, which doesn't have even close to as many rides. The regular Flash Pass was $75. I think it was worth it, but my time was at a premium. We probably could have ridden the same amount of rides if we had not used the FP and stayed 2-3 more hours. If it is really busy, the FP can be a bigger advantage, especially the more expensive ones.Overall, I have had good experiences at SFMM. The coasters are awesome and that's what I came for. The really good ones are not a disappointment to me.",Chris92SE
50,We had a blast,"As a family 5 (Kids 11,9,7) we had a blast going 6 Flags, My kids went on most of the rides so it OK to take pre teenage kids. Going midweek meant we didn't wait more 5 mins all day which just made the day so much better. All 3 kids said 6 Flags was much better than Disneyland",Numbersinaflash
30,Service nose-dive,Most of the workers seemed to have more 'attitude' than usual. We have had season passes (annual Gold Pass) for three years now...but this year's crop of young adults was really bad. We got dis-service from several - talked with Supervisors twice and submitted two on-line complaints. Wow...really going downhill. Disappointed in their lack of basic customer service. They even made a little girl cry!,califmac
10,Cheated,During our 4 hour stay spent 3 hours 50 minutes queueing. Goliath not working. No point buying a flash pass as everyone has bought one so that the Flash Pass queue was just as bad.Money grabbing USA at its worst.,Marcus44
50,best moments,"six flags is one of the best place to have fun with your family, friends or anyone and one thing is for sure is that you will enjoy it",Carlos T
20,Not Nice,"Bought tickets and Flash pass tickets as we only had 1 day for park, the Flash Pass tickets averaged around $ 87 each above the price of admission plus another $ 15 dollars each above this for 2 new rides. High by my standards, but to top this off Flass Pass set up was not working, and we spent almost 2 hrs. running from one person to another, there standard phrase was SORRY, not much help. Finally did get a pass to go to exit and ride 3 rides, then Flash Pass was working.I couldn't believe a company of this size without a back up plan. Over all the park is dirty. Needs to have more interaction and a staff that trys to look like they care if you are there. I have been bringing family members to park sense the park opened, children now grand children NO MORE.The only plus is the thrill rides. Magic Mountain is not near other attractions in Calif. so to visit takes a hotel stay aftr park closes. For a family of 4 with flas Pass tickets it can be pricy. The Flash Pass tickets did cut time way down, but when you remain on rides the staff should let next in line know, you should not have to deal with this yourself. The one real plus of Flash Pass was on most rides you could just show yoiur wrist band and stay on. The lines are long way long so if you are only there for a day without Flash Pass , you would not get on very many of the thrill rides. Note The Green Lantern can hurt. I love thrill rides but would advise skipping this one, not much thrill just a bar that bruisd my legs. ( I am average size 5'4' 135# so it wasn't a size issue). Over all even the 2 teens were thinking the vacation dollars and time could best be spent somewhere else. Will not recommend to any of my Utah friends .NOT MUCH MAGIC IN MAGIC MOUNTAIN.",scooter65
30,Mixed bag,"The rides are outstanding. My favorite is Goliath, as I love fast coasters with big drops. Two bad things though: 1) We pre-purchased a Gold Flash Pass. Arrived at the park at 11am only to be told the Flash Pass system was unavailable. ""The first time this has ever happened"" is the line we were given by employees who were a bit rude and unprofessional. The park didnt have an idea of when the system would be up, although did tell us we would get refunded if it didnt come back up. Told us to leave them a phone # and they would call us as ""soon as the system was up"". We were on line for a ride at around 230pm when we saw other park guests start forming on the Flash Pass line. Started hearing chatter that the system was up, so after we got off the ride we did return to the front to pick up our pass (this was around 3pm or so). I didnt receive a call until 6pm that the system ""was now up"". So much for calling us right away. I realize they had a long list to call, but doing so should be the #1 priority so staffing should have been supported enough to be able to handle that high volume of calls.Once we got the pass, everything was fine until 9pm. The park closes at 9pm but states that if you are line for a ride at 9...you are able to wait on line for as long as it takes to be able to go on the ride. We reserved Tatsu with our Flash Pass at 9:05pm. Went to the line, waited for 15 mins only to be told we reserved too late and couldnt get on the ride. The employee who told us was also extremely rude and said ""sorry you cant on the ride"". And then made the Price is Right ""you just lost"" sound right to our faces. No reason for that to say the least. We dropped off the pass and made sure to complain about the employee and the manager we talked to was very nice, and said he would address that behavior with the employee.",MikeL08091981
20,Not as expected,"The lines are long, 1.5 to 2 hours wait for most coasters.Lockers are a joke since the time limit is 2 hours, and the ride wait is 2 hours. They need all day lockers for a reasonable price. Lockers are needed outside the gate to store items not allowed in the park. The park restricts all multi-tools or knives. Not everyone is a gang member in this world, so some people do carry the mini leatherman. Too bad the park punishes good people due to the bad people.I will go to Disny and Universal from now on. I won't return here. They nickle and dime you to death, and the lines for rides are ridiculous. The employees are great, but the general operations of the park need a lot of improvement. The management should go to Disney and Universal to understand the experience. If you make people wait, at least entertain them or make it a pleasure to wait.",Arthur K

Not Disney, but that's them and they don't have the COASTERS! We had a flash pass and was able to do 13 coasters in 9 hours. Don't think we could have done half that w/o the flash.",MauiJake2013

10,Would give it ZERO if I could,"We have been to many theme parks all over the world (in high season) and this was by far our worst ever experience, in fact it was the worst day trip we have ever had on a holiday. A complete waste of time and money.We were actually in the park for around 8 hours, in all that time we queued constantly and in all had 3 rides. Yes...... 3 rides.They packed so many people in it was unsafe, there were several toilets out of order, almost all the water fountains were not working and there was over an hours wait to queue and buy a drink.On the last ride there was almost a riot, with missiles (water bottles and cups) being thrown at the ride workers - people were so frustrated.We went to 'customer relations' - where there was also a long queue of people complaining about the lack of facilities and overcrowding. But found the staff very unhelpful and unsympathetic ( we wanted a refund as we didnt think that 3 rides was good value).When we returned home I emailed customer relations several times and have never had a reply or an apology.DO NOT VISITVisited July 2012",Annette H

50,Lots of fun for families!,Our family of 5 had a great time at Six Flags Magic Mountain.

I think we were all pleasantly surprised by how much fun we all had and not just a few of us. Looking forward to our return visit!,Lana W
50,Thrilling Fun and cheap if you adipe the right strategy!,"It's just 40mins from la and roller coaster, expecially x2 and tatsu, are amazing. If you book at least 3days in advance is 35 dollars but the parking is18 so carpooling (or long walk from outside parking) are recommended. There are water fountains so take a bottle an dont buy drinks inside if you don't wish tone robbed. We ate a huge breakfast and didn't have lunch but nobody checked bags carefully so I think that the policy of not introducing outside food is not so strict.but can guarantee on it,so my suggestion is having a super breakfast and going to the park from 10:30 to 17 and then have dinner outside. We bought the basic flash pass which was a bit expensive but allowed us to do more than 10 rides in a day never Qing except that for x2 which is not reservable with the flash pass. Look on the web for a coca cola voucher code that give you 1dollar of discount.",Bipolary
40,"Awesome rides, some flaws","Great rides - some brilliant coasters. Hugely frustrating to wait in line for over 30 mins to park (the $18 should be added to the entry cost, would make things so much quicker) - could be much better organised. Ride lines can get very long, but no worse than comparable parks like Universal. Food and drink very expensive and poor quality. Fact is, it's mostly about the coasters, and they are fabulous.",Dazzer6666
40,Six Flags Magic Mountain,Six Flags Magic Mountain is a great place to visit if our a thrill seeker or if you want to take your family including young children to go ride the rides in the kids area they offer.

50,Amazing! I simply do this every time I can!,"I love Six Flags MM! I live in San Diego, CA, so I go there every time I can! This is what I usually do: I buy my tickets using a student discount, and I make sure parking is previously paid for, since you save some time doing this! Me and my friends have already agreed upon the fact that buying the Gold Flash Pass is the way to go; an obligated purchase, yet an expensive one.We enjoy as many rides as we can, and we usually buy corn on a cob for only ~$3.00! Perhaps the cheapest option within the park.We do NOT pay for the extra on the Flash Pass for the cool rides such as X2 or Green Lantern... we save them for the grand finale, while we have dinner on the line (which lasts about 45 min).Finally, lockers are expensive, so wear pants that will secure your keys and wallet! Minimize your belongings!If you like roller coasters, just go! It is an amazing time!",Eduardo
30,Gotta do it once,"Six Flags Magic Mountain comes as advertised... ridiculous thrills from more roller coasters than you can do in a day. Parking is easy and with a shuttle is quite convenient. Our first coaster was X2 which had a sign saying it's a 45 min wait. After 45 min had passed and we were only half way through the line, we were too commited to leave. The ride was insane... easily the most intense coaster I've been on. Was it worth the lineup? I don't think any 50 second ride is worth a 1.5 hour lineup in 110 degree heat, but incredibly we weren't disappointed after the ride, if that makes sense. The rest of the rides had shorter lines - anywhere from no wait to 20 minutes. There are rides to suit all sorts of thrill seekers, from mild to extreme.When we left Anaheim, it was a comfortable 75 degrees. An hours drive east to get to Six Flags, the temperature was an almost unbearable 110 degrees. I definitely recommend that you don't plan to go in the middle of summer if possible. There is a lot of walking to get between coasters and there is a lot of uphill and downhill terrain. On a hot day, this was most unpleasant.",Yysguy
30,Long lines!,Never go to the park on Saturday! Even ig you go buy flash pass or you will spend all your day just waiting in the lines!,Aigul S
50,"Great for big kids, teens and Adults - a thrill seekers paradise","Most of the rides have a height limit so check your little ones height before paying the entrance fee! Discount tickets are available all the time...check with your local hotel, they often will sell you a discount ticket, or craigslist as locals often have free passes or unused companion tickets from season passes they try to sell. (Season pass holder must be present to use companion tickets). Eat before you enter the park. There are fast food and ""better"" chains just before the entrance (Marie Callendars, El Torito, Red Lobster) and plenty more a freeway exit in either direction. Once in the park, Moose burger lodge offers air conditioning, free drink refills an all you can eat buffet option, and clean bathrooms, but you'll spend more time than just grabbing some quicker grub options. Sitting in A/C and being served is worth it in my book... It's all expensive so just plan for it. If you plan on several return visits the refillable drink cup is worth it, otherwise...remember, all food vendors are obligated to give you a cup of water (tap) for free. Don't bring a purse, backpack or other stuff... you can't have it on the rides with you, you'll need to leave it unattended near the ride exit, or rent a locker at each ride ($1), or rent a locker near the front exit. However, MM is a mountain, yes, that means up and down walking. So you're not going to want to walk back to your locker for your lip balm. Best bet is to head left at the entrance, towards X2 and Viper, make your way over the Mountain going on the rides you choose to along the way, to the top, hit Superman and other rides that enter from the top and then head down to the back side ONCE, and come around toward Lex Luther and Goliath the front when you're done.If you have a locker in one location, let's say the front you'll be going back and forth. Ok if you like hoofing it but otherwise, just dont bring stuff. Carry cash, sunscreen, and your car keys. Have fun!",alisaj_12

30,Magic Mountain,"It's a good place if you like roller coasters for young adults and teenagers. so so for families with younger kids.

Bring cash because you'll feel like you have a hole in your pocket if the kids play any of the arcade games. Best time to go, mid week, avoid weekends and holidays. Also I made sure hat I brought hand sanitizer...housekeeping isn't one of the strong points at Magic Mountain. If you have a choice I would recommend Disneyland, Universal Studios, the Long Beach Aquarium, San Diego Zoo or Sea World.",Riroerick976

The rides were cool, fast past was good, a little bit pricey, But good! the food was etter than other parks that i have been before.",Zwinbawie
20,Great rides but bad logistics,"As experienced Disney visitors we consider this as the standard. The rides in Six Flags are great, but long waiting lines occur due to bad logistics. And the park wasn't even overcrowded! To me it's incredible why loading people in a ride takes so much time and the capacity and frequency of the rides is also very poor. There is no staff performing queue management on the platform which complete differs from the almost military logistics in a Disney park. For some rides Six Flags leaves it to the visitors how to load themselves into a ride and this completely unstructured approach lead to chaos. On the other site of the platform holders of Flash passes are given priority by staff members on SF but they can choose their own seat. This means that we, after one hour waiting finally on the first row, had two wait three rides before we could embark.The non-smoking policy doesn't seem to impress all the visitors but no staff was available to keep an eye on this bad behavior. We left the park with disappointment.",Gulliver_Ron
50,So Many Amazing Roller Coasters!!,"Our group of 7 (3 teenagers, 4 adults) had a great time at Six Flags. We bought our tickets online 3 days in advance which gives you a cheap price of admission ($41.99). We also pre-purchased Gold Flash Passes for all of us. We arrived at the park about 30 minutes before it opened which meant we had a great parking space and were near the front of the line to get into the park. Since we didn't want to pay $15 extra (for each person) to reserve spots on the X2 & Full Throttle, we immediately went to X2 when the park opened, headed over to Full Throttle next, then went & picked up our Flash Passes. Only one person can pick up the Flash Pass (you have to watch a video before you can purchase your passes then wait in line to purchase the passes - I still had to wait in line even though I had already paid). While one person waits in line, it's a good time for everyone else to visit the restroom. Keep in mind - from what I could tell, the purchase line moved slowly because lots of people don't have a clue what they are buying and ask all kinds of questions that can be easily answered online or by watching the video. Don't be that person - do your homework & know what you want to buy! Also, remember that you have to leave your photo id with them when you receive your pass (School id's are not accepted).We were extremely happy with the Gold Flash Pass. It was a hot day in July and we couldn't stand the thought of waiting in long lines for rides. Also, we're from Canada so we only had one day to have as much fun as possible so it was worth the money for us. The pass significantly reduced our waiting time and greatly improved our enjoyment of the park. We were there to ride roller coasters... which we did from the opening of the park at 10:30am until the closing at 9pm. We absolutely loved: X2, Full Throttle, Tatsu (rode it 3 times), Goliath, Riddler's Revenge, Batman & Superman. Scream was pretty good but they were only running one train and the wait to get on it was ridiculous (even with a Gold Flash pass!). We weren't too crazy about the Green Lantern. It's definitely not appropriate for anyone who has ever had neck or back issues or any type of head injury/concussion. At two points during the ride you are thrown forward, then whipped backwards causing your head to smash backwards (i.e. instant headache). A non-roller coaster that's really fun is Lex Luthor Drop of Doom - it's extremely high AND you can feel the tower swaying when you get to the top... awesome!). There's a good place to eat near it, too. We enjoyed the sushi and the chicken salad (expect to pay about $12 per person for lunch). It was plenty of food and it was tasty so we felt the prices were fair. Don't forget you can ask for a glass of water (for free). You can also save a lot of money by bringing your own water bottle & filling it throughout the day. We brought granola bars & energy bars stave off any hunger pangs & ate a late dinner at BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse (24320 Town Center Dr., Valencia 91355) after we left the park.All in all, we had a fantastic day. In fact, I would go so far as to say it was the best day we've *ever* had at an amusement park! If you love roller coasters, it is definitely worth a visit. I would LOVE to go back!",FeetEssentials

30,"5 Stars for the rides, 1 Star for Everything Else","Roller coaster fans will love this park. Some world class rides are the highlight, for sure. If I based my review solely on the rides, it would be 5 stars. Full Throttle, Superman, X2, Green Lantern, Goliath...these were a few that we really enjoyed. However, there's more to a park than just rides, and this is where Magic Mountain falls short.Where to begin? Well, our first impression at the main gate was not a good one. The line for security was long and didn't seem to move quickly. We then needed to visit ""Will Call"" because we used our Go Los Angeles cards for our admission. This line was ridiculously slow and moved with no efficiency what so ever. The bathrooms at the main gate were old and disgusting. So, before we even entered through the actual main gate, we already had a bad impression.As I mentioned earlier, the rides themselves were great. However, line jumping in this park is awful and the park employees do nothing to stop it. In fact, we hardly saw park employees in any of the queue areas. The loading of most rides was not done with any sort of efficiency except on the newer coasters, like Full Throttle. Park guests are left to their own devices when lining up and funneling into the loading zones. On Superman there is a very crowded confusing queue area with not a park employee in sight to help facilitate the loading process, and this was the case with most rides.The restrooms for the entire park were old, smelly, and in various states of cleanliness. The entire park felt grimy and run down. Many places were in need of paint and general sprucing-up. The food was so expensive, we didn't want to eat more than we had to. I've never seen such overpriced amusement park food. There was trash everywhere, tables in eating areas were dirty, and employees were generally not motivated to do anything quickly or with efficiency. I wouldn't want to work there, and I would feel ashamed to work in such a filthy park. I place the blame for this on management. The employees have clearly not been trained as needed. This is not to say every employee was sub-par, but the majority of them did not seem to have any pride in what they were doing.The design and layout of this park is terrible. In the middle of the park is a ""mountain"" that you've got to trudge up to access several of the rides. Try to plan accordingly so that you only have to walk up it once. Nothing is easy to access, and the map isn't much help at times.No bags of any kind are allowed on any rides, but there aren't any types of compartments or places to put bags. Most of the time they're just tossed carelessly on the ride platform. I was worried about theft the entire time. Some rides have pay lockers at their entrances, but you have to have a credit card to use them. On Full Throttle's platform they had compartments for bags, but when we rode, a soda had been spilled inside the one we were to use and no one bothered to clean it up.We visited on a weekday and lines were on average 30 minutes. I'm glad we didn't visit on a weekend so that I didn't have to spend money on the Flash Pass It would probably be worth it on a crowded weekend, but that's only because they have absolutely no efficiency when it comes to loading the rides.In conclusion, we enjoyed riding some world-class coasters, but the rest of the experience was dismal. We've been to many amusement parks...ones owned by Disney, Universal, Cedar Fair, and the LEGOLAND parks. This was our first Six Flags park. I am not eager to visit another one. I will also not revisit this park. I'd rather spend my money at Disney or Universal if I were in the Los Angeles area again.",cool_teacher590

20,Too much money for too few rides.,"I took my 12 year old daughter here yesterday. It cost us $135 for two discounted entry tickets, one prepaid meal, and parking. We got there before the gates opened. When we got to our first ride, it took an hour to get on. I decided our day would be wasted if we only got on four or five rides with the wait time. We coughed up the $200+ for the platinum flash pass. Even with that extra money we still only rode nine times in 7 hours with a stop to eat lunch. In the end, we spent well over $300 for one meal, 3 bottles of water, and 9 rides. And there were only two rollercoaster rides that didn't hurt our ears from slamming against the hard plastic shoulder harnesses. We will not be visiting this park again.",jcromero27
30,Rides Are Great,Ride operators are slow and completely unfriendly.. they dont know what it means to smile.. You could ride twice the amount of rides if they cared or would move quicker. Food is barely fair in the park. Buy a season pass if your going to be there two days and USE your Discover card for great discounts!,Art B
20,"Horrible customer service, dirty park, good coasters","I was there yesterday with my14 year old twins.Here's the good:My kids LOVED the rides. I got the gold level flash pass for them, but not me, as I knew I would not be going on 90% of the rides. If you or your kids are adrenaline junkies, this is the place. They have the most extreme of the extreme roller coasters.I would not take children under the age of 9 or 10 as there is not a lot there for them.Lines were not too long, as we were there on Friday.Again, my teenage children LOVED the rides.Now for the bad:The park is FILTHY. I mean disgustingly dirty. Trash cans full when we got there (when the park opened).The bathrooms were horrendously dirty. Don't let your kids touch anything when they go in there.People working the rides were young, rude, unorganized and did not properly check if we were in the seats with safety bars secured. The staff was unable to answer most of the questions I had, about any topic. And they didn't answer, with an attitude.More often than not we would place ourselves in line with no attendant to guide us once we got into the staging area.I had tickets based on my company award point system, which when I went to will call, they refused to honor. My ""customer service agent"" said he had never heard of this (when I had the vouchers printed out) so I was forced to buy the tickets again. No one would help and I kept getting redirected to another ""agent"" who was useless.Go if all you want are the rides, but do NOT expect to be treated like a guest or with any respect.And take hand sanitizer.....",895Cerveza
50,My heart still skips a beat,"I guess we were lucky not to end up in endless queues as some other reviewers did. I visited Six Flags with some friends when we spent our holiday in California. We were able to do all the big rides in one day and did the Tatsu even twice.The rides X2, Tatsu, Goliath, Deja Vu and Riddler are really thrilling. We had the feeling that the park was somewhat understaffed,but you'll find your way easily. This is something we don't expect when visiting the USA as service levels are always high.Anyway, we had a great day and my heart still skips a beat when I look at the holiday pictures :-)",DeReuf
40,Has the potential for five stars,"The roller coasters here are awesome, the general environment in the park is great, the food we had was fine, so five stars then ? Not quite . The queue for food even at 2pm took too long. Why they insist in selling these bottomless cups at food stalls I do not know, that is what takes the time. No problem with getting fill ups , just only sell them at designated stalls and the food lines would go much quicker. On some rides there are no staff designated to load people on to the ride itself. This just leads to pandemonium and lots of gaps on the rides. Some reviews on here suggest that riders took advantage of this and jumped the line. I didn't see any of that. In fact people actively tried to organise it themselves. The toilets? They were OK but started to suffer towards the end of the day. Certainly no Disney but not as bad as some make out.Last thing. FLashPass. The regular FLashPass was absolutely essential. We managed eight out of eleven of the big thrill rides in 6 hours. We probably would have only got on 4 or 5 without it.All in all a great day but with a few imperfections.",Guxxi
50,Awesome,It was great. All the rides were open and they were great. Full throttle is really good. Tatsu is still the best!!!!!!,Gable S
50,excellent,"the restrooms were clean ,short lines , the food was great and its awsome for the family trip great and un -expensive",Lauryn H
40,Thrill rides galore!,"Six Flags Magic Mountain is heaven on Earth for roller coaster fans. They have some of the best in the world. The newest one, added in 2013, is called ""Full Throttle"" and boasts two forward thrusters and one reverse. The scariest, ""X2,"" NOT for the faint of heart. I love a good coaster, but this one put me over the edge on the fear factor. Once was enough for me. It had more twists and loops than any coaster I have ever ridden and whips its passengers upside-down and backwards on the outside of the rails. One of my personal favorites was ""Tatsu,"" in which you are suspended horizontally for the ride, which gives you a sensation of flying. Best to plan for at least a 2-day visit if you want to ride everything - sometimes the lines for the really great rides can excede an hours' wait. We arrived at about 11 and only got to ride about half of the rides before they closed.Now for the downside - if you are a Disney fan, this place is not for you. The park does not have the squeaky (pardon the pun) clean appearance of the Mouse's house. There was trash all over the place: under bushes, in the lines, dirty tables in the restaurants, puke on the sidewalk, bathroons are run down and in need of renovation - you get the picture? While there are some rides for the young ones, the majority of the park is roller coasters with height requirements so make sure if you bring a young child that you have someone to stay with him or her and that they understand they will not be able to go on many of the rides. You can bring a picnic lunch, but will have to eat it outside of the park. This probably would be a good idea, as the food is WAAAAY overpriced for what you get and wasn't very good. If you plan on drinking more than 3 soft drinks, buy a refillable cup. Refills are free on the 1st day and .99 cents for subsequent visits. (You can buy unlimited refills for 3.99 at the bakery that sells the funnel cakes, near the exit.) I did not see a single water fountain anywhere, but the soft drink vendors will fill your refillable cup with water.Overall, we had a good time and I wish we would have been able to arrive earlier to get in more rides.",Mrs_RSF
50,Best Roller Coasters in the West!,There is always room for improvement but Six Flags Magic Mountain is the best park in the west if you are a thrill seeker! Forget the other parks when it comes to rides because they are boring. Nobody does it like Six Flags Magic Mountain because when it comes to rides Magic Mountain sets the bar very high. Get down as soon as possible because FULL THROTTLE is Awesome and you have to ride it!!!,DarthWray
40,"Fun place, felt safe d/t security check at entrance.","People are friendly, very family oriented. The lines are long but the rides are great with exception of Revolution which bounced my head around so much that I got a headache.",Cuauhtemoc C
10,Don't waste your money!!!!,"Don't waste your money. Cleanliness, organization and maintenance is lacking! I would not take my kids back. Bathrooms were dirty, the grounds didn't seemed maintained.

50,The ultimate in fun!,"If you lone roller coasters and love to go them every 5-10 minutes, I enthusiastically recommend getting the Platinum Fast Pass, very well worth the money!",Paul N
40,Roller Coasters! Lots of them!,"Great roller coasters - that is what this theme park is all about, and that is exactly what you'll find here. Nice enough park, great collection of rides and okay service. Definitely worth a visit!",frankc6
50,Best amusement park ever!!!,We've been to the Six Flags in New Jersey and Cedar Point but I'd rank this place as the best of all for thrill rides. They have so many amazing coasters that it's tough to talk about all of them. Our absolute favorite is X2. I've never ridden a coaster like this before. I takes you up a giant hill while laying backward. Then as you are about to go down a giant hill the cart flips around so that you experience it as a face forward free fall. It does plenty of other cool things and includes music and fire as part of the ride. 2nd best coaster is Full Throttle which is brand new this year and does not disappoint as the worlds lagrest looping coaster. My only complaint is that the park should have stayed open until at least 10 pm. It's difficult to do all of the coasters in this park (17... I think) in one day.,Marc I
50,excellent,"The rides are at times scary, trilled but after all the entire family enjoyed the most. Of course if you like to feel the adrenaline to the maximum, this is the place. Great for teens ;) they enjoyed every single ride. Too bad there is extra charge for some of them. Too expensive :(",Maria R
40,Fun Rides,We had fun riding all the extreme coasters. We went in July. It was super hot and really crowded. Had to wait in line at least an hour to get on any of the good rides. On a good note the park was very clean. Of course the food is expensive and not very good so eat before you go in if you can.,Kimberlee B
50,Worth every penny!,I love the easy payment plans and the no black out schedule. This makes it easier to come and enjoy the park a little bit at a time with out the pressure of having to see the whole park in one day.,ECarrisales
10,place if falling apart,"Rides were great but park was overgrown buy weeds and a very lack of maintance. Saw latters leaning against rides with tools on the ground, most rides the paint was peeling off and there was trash all over the park. Almost all the canopies covering the line were worn and tattered. With the recent accident at six flags texas I would probably go back unless they hire the Disneyland crew to clean house.",jim m
20,No wonder they don't call this place the happiest place on earth...,"The website tells you to buy your ticket online to avoid the crowds at the ticket booth but they don't tell you that it takes 40 min. to get in through the security line (which was a mess that could have been assisted if they had employees making sure that there were organized lines instead of a free for all where everyone just bombards the security gates where you go through a metal detector). Make sure you grab a map because if you ask any of the 16 year old employees where a ride is, you won’t get an answer because they don't know. Almost everyone that I ran into at the park was NOT happy to be working there. The roller coasters where cool but the kiddy section only had about 6 rides so if you have younger children, this is not the park for you. A few of the rides were not open (you would think in the middle of summer and probably their busiest time of year, they would have everything operational). My daughter lost her hat on one of the rides and I showed the ride operator where it was. The ride operator said that she would get her supervisor to come and get it and that we could come back at 9:00 for it. I went back at 9:00 and she told me to go to lost and found. I waited 2 hours at lost and found only to be told that the supervisor did not find the hat (they must have been blind because if you looked at the ride, you would have seen the hat). When we left the park, it was after 11:00 and everyone had gone home (including the group of friends that I came with) so it was just me and my 5 year old daughter that were escorted by 15 security employees to the front gate…..not one of them offered to walk us to the parking lot (which was VERY dark and far from the front gate) to make sure that we were safe (even though there are signs everywhere that say that are concerned with safety first). NOT COOL! This summer alone I have been to Sea World, Legoland, Disneyland, and CA adventure and all of them were a 10 compared to Magic Mountain. I have no interest in going back!!!",Jen A
50,Amazing time at Magic Mountain!,"Amazing roller coasters! They keep getting better! Went to the park on a Monday, lines were not to bad. I would purchase the Flash Pass if we went on a weekend. Had an amazing time!",Jay P
50,Looking to experience tons of Thrills? Come to Six Flags Magic Mountain,"My experience with Six Flags Magic Mountain has always been amazing. I love the fact that its been three years in a row and Six Flags Magic Mountain in Valencia, California has opened a new ride for the past three years. If your looking to have some fun, get the family out, come here and you'll all have a blast, its a guarantee!",Melanie G
40,Great Park for Roller Coaster Lovers,"My family visited Magic Mountain this summer on our trip to California. My teenage son LOVES roller coasters, so he chose Six Flags as the place he most wanted to visit on our trip. He was not disappointed. Although I was terrified riding X2 (beware, it is INTENSE!), he and my daughter loved it. Both of the kids rode most of the coasters in the park and really enjoyed them.Tickets are reasonable, especially when purchased online through AAA. However, food is very expensive at the park. You are not allowed to bring outside food or drink into the park. The park also seems very spread out - there was a lot of walking between some of the rides. It also gets very hot midday in the summer, but the park is very well shaded - there are plenty of places to get out of the hot sun.We had a great time, though. If you love thrill rides, Magic Mountain is perfect for you!",Knani
40,Good experience,"Great park, very fun rides and a lot to do. I wouldn't recommend this park for little kids but for the older kids and adults. Only problem was the restaurant didn't give my grandma what she wanted, There is hardly anywhere to sit, the flash pass line to pick up the device was slow, and a ride operator let four kids on full throttle through the flash pass line and they didn't have a flash pass. Overall I will return to the park.",sandiegolover12

50,Awesome day with the family! Flash Pass a must in the summer!,"I've been to Six Flags Magic Mountain many times but wanted to write a review about my latest experience since it was our first time purchasing the Flash Pass. We visited the park on Saturday, July 20th so we expected it to be crowded & hot. It wasn't as hot as expected but definitely pretty crowded since it was a weekend in the summertime. My husband & I visited with our 2 teenagers and we all LOVE rollercoasters! This is definitely the best park around for anyone who loves thrill rides! We arrived before the park opened since we wanted to ride the newest roller coaster ""Full Throttle"" first thing before the line got too long. Once inside the park we went straight for the entrance of that ride and were on/off within 20 minutes, success!We then went to the Flash Pass office to check out the options available. We opted for the least expensive option known as the ""Regular Flash Pass"". Basically we could reserve a place in line using the device and we would wait the same amount of time as the current wait time without having to stand in line…sold! For our party of 4 we paid $135 for this privilege. The next level “Gold Flash Pass” would have cost us around $230 and would have cut our wait time for each ride by 50% of whatever the current wait time was. The “Platinum Flash Pass” basically eliminates all waiting times but would have cost us $350 for our party of 4, pretty steep! We almost opted for the Gold level but they told us we could upgrade anytime during the day if the wait times were too long so we opted for the regular & were totally happy with the way it worked out. Once you reserve a ride on the device you can’t search or reserve another ride until you’ve checked in for your current reservation. So once you’re in line you can scroll through and see what you want to do next, it was AWESOME! Definitely worth the money spent & glad we didn’t spend more because it was really unnecessary. We stayed until 9pm and rode all the rides and even rode Superman & Tatsu twice. There is a fee ($10-$15 per person?) to add Full Throttle and X2 to the device on the Gold & Platinum levels and you can only ride it once, this seems like a rip off and we didn’t think it was necessary. Most of the wait times were at least an hour but instead of standing in a long line sweating to death we were able to have lunch, grab snacks & sit in the shade in between each ride, priceless especially with whiney teenagers!Overall our day at the park was TONS of fun but really tiring. If you’ve never been it’s a really big park and there are a lot of hills so comfortable shoes are a must. Some of the bathrooms are small & I waited in line more than once to use the women’s restroom which was annoying. But overall this park has been a favorite of mine since I was a kid. I read so many reviews where people complain about the cleanliness of the park and the people who visit but seriously? It’s an amusement park, if you’re not focused on silly things like that you’re guaranteed to have a blast here!",MrsMadrid
40,Best trip,This park is very fun its an all day vist the best things are the rollercoasterThere's many things to do play games go on wet rides with your family,Dianna B

50,Thrill rides GALORE!,The best amusement park in So Cal! This is definitely the place to go if you're a true roller coaster enthusiast. Been coming here since I was a little girl and its only gotten better over the years.,Azucena A
40,Use the Lockers!,"The staff was great. The rides were very good. BUT, take all the keys, phones, and whatever out of your pockets and put them in a locker.My nephew's iPhone 4 fell out of my pocket on the Green Lantern ride in the morning. We had to get the shattered iPhone from the Lost and Found after the park closed at 9 pm. There were a bunch of us waiting until all the lost items were returned by the maintenance crew.The staff was always friendly and helpful, but it's frustrating waiting all day to see if your stuff was found.The reason I gave the theme park 4 stars instead of 5, is that the 'Flash Pass' is too expensive for what it offers.The park is already so expensive, as is the parking, that the Flash Pass should be priced lower.",CookieB7
30,"Great fun, greater rides, somewhat overrated.","This was our first visit to an American amusement park, and while it certainly lives up to the American motto ""bigger is better"", I can't shake off the feeling that this park is a bit overrated.The rides are varied, so there is something for everyone in terms of thrill and excitement. Our absolute favorite was Tatsu and X1, which got high score both for thrill and design. A well-designed coaster should bring maximum thrill, but should not actually be uncomfortable in terms of seating, g-force and movement. Several of the older rides failed in this respect.As a Norwegian, I'm dependent on a constant supply of water to cool myself in the relenteless California heat. Luckily there were always a vending machine or a sales stand with water nearby!The food was appalling, and restaurants far too few and shabby. It seemed like we were not supposed to get too comfortable while dining, but rather have a quick bite before going out to roam the streets and spend more on water, snack and sideshows.The park is very commercial. I know, there's no such thing as a free lunch, but to charge $15 extra pr person pr ride when we already spent $187 on a Platinum Flash pass seems greedy. Also the constant flow of ads emerging from our Flash Pass gizmo that we were carrying was quite annoying. Actually, the entire park felt like one large advertisement at times.That said, the Plash Pass Platinum is an absolute must! We rarely queued for more than 5-10 minutes on each ride, while non-pass riders queued for an hour on many of the rides.This park is in desperate need of more shade and cooling facilities. Our visiting day was luckily overcast most of the time. A sunny day would have grilled us completely, especially when you have to walk a good 10 minutes between each ride. I'm convinced that had there been more places to cool of and relax, we might have had the energy to stay for at least a couple of more hours than we actually did.The park was luckily very clean, with available bins everywhere. Even the heavily used restrooms were quite clean, although the park seemed to have run out of paper towels at the end of the day.I'm not sure if i would recommend this park to friends and family. If you're going to have any fun without queuing yourself to death, the total cost for a whole family is quite high, since the actual entry ticket is only the beginning of your expenses.I'm happy that we went, but I'm definitively not going again.",Terje K
10,DO NOT go in the summer.,"This park is not for anyone who want to have fun, unless you like the heat, to sweat, stink, and smell other people's B.O. while standing in endless massive lines, to get on a ride. It's not equipped with misters, and they have rules against bringing in your own, so don't try it! They also do not allow you to bring in water, or any survival food or drink (like water) ... you have to pay big bucks to get water so if its over 95 deg STAY HOME - do not go to this horrible park.",designwithenergy
50,Satisfied,"Our overall experience was great. We will visit again and recommend the park to family and friends. We recommend that visitors bring comfortable clothing and walking shoes. We also recommend that you ride the Gold Rusher, Tidal Wave, Jet Streamer, Roaring Rapids and Sand Blasters. All rides in the park seem to be safe and fun.",Albert E
30,"Good rides, long lines.... flash pass is worth it......","So this was my second year going back to Six Flags. Last year we were bummed about waiting in line for certain rides for literally HOURS. So this year we purchased a Gold Flash Pass, which cuts the waiting time in half. Once you get onto the ride you reserved you then can program in another ride you want to go on. This method worked AWESOME. However, this pass does not work for X2, or Full Throttle. You have to pay extra for those rides. We went on a week day which was smart, cause it was less busy than last year during the weekend. As much as I liked Full Throttle I felt the ride could use shoulder harness....since it is super fast and does go upside down. You would think with the rep this place is getting with been unsafe that they would have thought about safety a little more on this ride. We managed to sneak in some granola bars which kept us full, since it's simply Highway Robbery when it comes to food costs in the park. And if you park far from the gate, catching the busy is really worth it, it saves your legs. Overall we had a good time.",travelcosmolady
10,Great disappointment,"lines were long,we waited in the hot sun,some shade but not enough.we went on a monday.there were no shows or other entertainment.

50,A great day out,"We, mum and two teenage boys, spent a 10 1/2 hour day at the park and loved every minute. Boys loved every single ride again and again. bought the Platinum fast passes pricey but worth it we made full use of them Mum not a big roller coaster fan. But plenty of place to sit in the shade to wait for the riders.",KatieKL
40,Awesome rides,"Awesome rides for the teenager, a bit less for the 7-year-old, but still very good! Flashpass is expensive, but we wouldn't have been able to do all the rides without it. I do think it's too expensive though - compared to others.",Smelters15
20,DON'T BUY SEASON PASSES,I bought a season pass for me and a guest pass so I could take a friend so I wouldn't have to go alone. I was forced to give away my guest pass and treated like a cockroach!!!!! U are better off getting season passes to California Adventure.,Ann M
50,Six Flags Magic Mountain,"Magic Mountain was a pit of gangs and thugs in the late 90s and almost went out of business in the early 2000s. Fortunately, it has reinvented itself as a family-friendly theme park. It is clean and appropriate for all family members. The rides are extreme, but there is still enough to keep the little ones entertained. I highly recommend a trip. Be prepared, like all other Southern California theme parks, be prepared to spend money.",Jon T
10,Wasted $300,over priced everything horrible unfriendly staff. They took away my 5 yr olds juice boxes and cheese crackers. So they can charge $3.50 for a water bottle! Horrible time,jena904
50,Great times,"Iv been going to magic mountain ever since I was little, iv had amazing times. So many gray memories. Very rarely was there any troubles with the rides. Iv been going there for years and yea iv got stuck on rides but if you think about it, it's making memories, and while your stuck they let you get infront of any line when you get off. This park is amazing with every ride and activities. This Is my favorite theme park of all time this is a MUST GO! So get up and visit 6flags magic mountain today!",Macayla G
50,Six Flags Magic Mountain Rocks!,Excellent number of good roller coasters and the lines during the month of July were surprisingly not that long. Use the Flash Pass it is well worth the money.,LEROYLLAMAS
50,Roller Coaster Mecca To Feed Yer Need Fur Speed!,"I just finished my day at Magic Mountain. We gave this to my daughter for her 16th birthday. It was an wonderful and incredible cornucopia of g-force bending coasters that will make any one who loves coasters incredibly happy and fulfilled.Some of these other reviews complaining about cleanliness and the ghetto nature of the clientele I found were off base. If you want some sterilized version of America go to Disneyland. I thought the amazing variety of ethnicities at the park was a wonderful example of how multicultural America has become. We never felt threatened here, instead we saw lots of people who share a love for crazy exciting thrill rides. It was ok clean. Not pristine but not horrible.This park was perfect for my family and kids who are 12 & 16 and love roller coasters, we can't get enough of them and we have few good ones in the Seattle area where we come from. We had a wonderfully joyful day together father, son and daughter. It will be something I remember my whole life.All of this is also cautionary advice for anyone who has young families. This park is perfect for teenagers and Dad's like me who never wanted to grow up. But it is not for the squeamish and not for young children. I saw almost no young kids here and there are few rides for them.The other reality about this park is BRING YOUR WALLET AND BUY ONLINEWe bought the platinum Flash pass along with general admission. I would do this online to get the extra discount 3 days or more prior to your trip. Get ready to pay over 120 bucks per person because they make you also pay extra for X2 or Full Throttle, the two hot coasters they recently opened...this final gesture after buying the flash pass I thought was a rip off.Getting into the park takes a ridiculous amount of time so buy online everything you can.But once in and once you get your flash pass it is awesome. We could walk on to almost any coaster in the morning and then get to ride them 2x in a row. Without the flash pass we would have been able to ride only half the number of coasters. In 7 hours we were totally thrashed and happy at the rides we got. We rode every coaster twice except x2 and full throttle.Scariest coaster of all was this green lantern, which Is the wildest coaster design I have ever seen. If you want the feeling of someone grabbing you by the scruff the neck and shaking you in mid-air seeing if you will fall off - do this ride. It was wild and so unsettling this g force junkie had to pass on doing that one again as did my kids :)Goliath was our favorite and then every other one of the top thrill rides will not disappoint. This is the most incredible park for roller coasters I have ever been to. I kneel before its greatness. But it is pretty damn expensive.",Mikeald
40,Fun at Magic Mountain,"We (parents plus 12 and 14 year old girls) went to Magic Mountain on a Friday in July. I was worried that it would be very busy, very hot, dirty, bad food, etc. after reading all of the reviews on here. But kids really wanted to go so we decided to give it a chance. We had been previously, but not in over 20 years.We had such an awesome day. The line for parking was very long and they seemed very slow in getting cars through the line. The line for tickets and the line to go through security were also very long and the ticket line was super slow. The security line at least moved a bit quicker, but it was very hot waiting in the line. Then there is a line to get into the park and give your ticket. This was great because we have a discover card and it happens to be the official credit card for six flags. They had a separate Discover Cardholder line. Nobody was in it so we were able to get right through. Also you save 5% on everything in the park if you use your discover card.Once it the park it was great. There were some lines but nothing horrible. My younger daughter isn't in to the huge roller coaster and is a little big for the baby rides, but there were a few of the kiddie rides that she enjoyed and then they have a bunch of rides they call ""thrill seekers in training"" that were not kiddie rides, but tamer than the mega coasters. She did many of those and had an awesome time.My older daughter did a bunch of the bigger coasters and the longest wait was Goliath at 45 minutes. I went on a few of the coasters with her and my husband went on a few with her as well. Lots of fun! Also went on the Jet Stream as I loved it when I was there several years ago and was happy to see it still running. So much fun!The park was pretty clean. No not as clean as Disneyland or Sea World, but also not near as busy as those places and half the price. The bathrooms were fine. Not sparkling, but fine. It is very hot, but they can't do anything about that.The food was actually pretty good. Yes, it is theme park prices, but you are at a theme park and that's what you pay. The food itself was some of the better theme park food I have had. We ate at a place that had Mexican food, fish and chips, sushi and ice cream. The carne asada tacos were really good as was the quesadilla and the nachos were very decent. We bought one souvenier cup and it was totally worth it. It was $15 but you get free refills all day on the date of purchase. We filled it up 7 times, the last two were with ice water, but better than getting small cups of stuff all day. Also is a nice keepsake.I was so very suprised at what a good day we had. I would recommend people give it a shot.",pjinazPhoenix
10,Waste of money and time...,"I don't think I've ever written a review for anything before but Six Flags Magic Mountain, or Ghetto Mountain as we dubbed it was very disappointing. The park was dirty, the rides were poorly maintained and one ride in particular, Superman, I think was so loud and obnoxious - even if you weren't on it - that we left that area of the park. It physically hurt your ears. Two hours into in and we were all ready to leave. The distance from the parking lot to the main gate was ridiculous and only one shuttle bus was in service with a line a mile long, we walked. Security was non-existent. We didn't have any particular bad thing happen, it was just a disappointing and dismal place to be. In short, don't waste your money.",rhondalprintdot
50,Great Trip for the Family,"My family and I had so much fun at the park. I thought there wouldn't be much for my young daughters to do, but they had so much fun. There were so many rides for them to ride and so many games for them to play.",Sarah D
50,Best ride ever!!!,Full Throttle is the best Coaster...Me and my family really enjoy all the roller coasters and attractions of this park...It was an amazing Day!!!,Diana E
50,Great for Young Kids,Magic Mountain is a great place to take young kids. If you buy a season pass with parking its a inexpensive place to take the kids. My son is a toddler and loves Bugs Bunny World. Plus there are other family rides throughout the park. We go a few times a month and have never had a bad experience. The staff and ride operators are always friendly and helpful. The park is very clean and with all the security you feel safe.,Cheryl K
50,fantastic experience,This is a day for roller coaster fanatics. Couldn't have asked for more thrills. Nothing like it!!!Go early and stay late. Best for the older ones in the family unless you visit the water park.,Laura T
50,Great time,My sixteen year old son and I had a great time. It was a very hot day . They have a refillable cup you can buy but it is very pricey. I think it was 16.95. That could be a small fortune if you have a large family. Wish they had something a little more affordable.,Mary A
20,Did not feel welcomed or safe,"My wife and I decided to ride Tatsu. It was our turn to get on the ride, we were fully strapped and ready to go. A few seconds after the locks opened and we were all asked to get off and stand in line and wait. They said they were having ""difficulties"". They gave us no sense of security or that they had the situation under cotrol. They perfomed a single test run without passengers and then asked us to re enter the ride. My wife and I and I'm pretty sure the rest of the group were hopping the ride was going not going to fail in mid air. Moreover, their customer servise is subpar unlike Hollywood studios or Disneyland. Standing in line is not entertaining and they don't have vendor as your waiting to purchase water or snacks. Bathrooms are nasty and unmantained. Many rides don't have any control prior to getting on and therefore people are pushing and cutting in line in front of little kids. This park is fun if you are in group full with teenagers that don't care for family environment. Six Flags Magic Mountain needs a complete overhaul in infrastructure and in their management. Just my humble opinion. Hope it goes better for everyone else.",sdman85
50,Magic Mountain,"As always,if you are looking for the best thrill rides and coasters, Magic Mountain is the place you want to be! No other theme park in Socal compares! The rides are amazing and the park is nicely maintained. Watch out for the parking fees!",Ramee M
50,1 day at Six Flags,I had a great time here! Alot of rides but mainly roller costers. I would say it was to hot here in july but if make sure to eat and rest at the hottest hours you can manage. The best time was the evening. You really should buy a souvenir cup with free refills of drinks. Without it the hot air would have been to much.,Amanda W
50,The must do Theme Park in LA,"We had the BEST time at Six Flags! We went on 4th of July, and the park was pretty busy. We bought a Fast Pass which helped us make the most of our time (which is also the best Fast Pass system ever!). The park is SO big that even though it was busy it didn't feel crowded. We went in the early afternoon and stayed until park closing time at 9pm.The rides were amazing, and there were so many. We didn't get on all of them, but didn't feel like we missed out. The Water Rafting Ride was my only let down, and thats just because i don't really like getting wet - hahah! It was the wetest water ride i've ever been on at a theme park. Like we actually had water in our raft half way up our legs! Luckily it was a hot day, but walking round in wet shoes wasn't ideal. The best ride was the Full Throttle ride, you HAVE to do this ride, it was out of this world! We got refillable drink bottles which were affordable and a great keepsake. My nephew who is 6, was unable to go on some of the rides, but there were still plenty he could go on. Overall, Six Flags ticked all of the boxes for us, we went to four theme parks while in LA (Disney, Disney Adventure, Universal and Six Flags) and Six Flags was the BEST by far!If you are a thrill seeker, then make sure you make the time to go to Six Flags!",Flyingkiwisnz

40,good value,"Best Value of all the parks we have been to, probably need a 2 or even 3 day pass if you want to do all the rides. Great for the kids cos’ the rides are what they want most. Service in the food outlets were terrible, too slow, no motivation, no enthusiasm, quality of the food was rather poor as well.The kids give it 2 thumbs up and that’s good enough for me.",Bill K
10,"Known Issue Of Ongoing Theft at Six Flags Magic Mountain, California","On 7/9 my family & I drove 3 hours from San Diego to Magic Mountain (MM), stood in line for 1 hour in 110 degree weather for our 1st ride, X2. My valuables as well as my teenage son's belongings were stolen in front of the staff, all responses were ""I'm sorry we can't help you"", ""Unfortunately we aren't responsible for lost or stolen items"". I spoke with Supervisor Christina at Guest Relations requesting a refund for 3 adult tickets as we had been there a little over an hour and 1 ride, she refused stating it's not her responsibility that our things were stolen. I file a police report w/the Sheriffs office onsite AFTER 2 male security guards told me the Sheriffs could not help. Officer M indicated this has been an ongoing issue which is getting worse and MM hasn't done anything to rectify. Other than Officer M and Security Guard E who helped facilitate a report, all other staff members refused to help and provided only excuses stating it was not their responsibility. I will NEVER EVER go back and plan to forward the information to Camp Pendleton where I purchased the tickets. Parents and kids, beware, Office M arrested 2 women who had 12 bags in their car and 10 on them for a total of 22 bags/purses stolen from MM in one day!",rebekahbaez
40,Great but not enough shady areas....traffic can be busy getting there,"Good fun ...obviously very busy, food not the best but plenty to do. Traffic on the way there can be very busy so chose your travel time carefully. The theme park looked much more fun though!,",ofey
10,Big Mistake during the summer heat wave,"Biggest mistake going July 5th. 4 Rides in 8 hours what an absolute joke. Flash pass?? No that is called those who can afford play, those who cannot watch others play. I am extremely disappointed. Security did not stop line jumpers & those boarding passes, well they are a joke. An employee collecting them said she just has to assume people are trustworthy. Put 5,000 people in a box where everyone wants out first and see the shady behavior. Warning DO NOT ride the Superman ride. The ice cave has no ventilation. You will pass out from the heat on a hot day. Do not forget the stench of sweaty people with no air, you get the point! The park left me more than disappointed after having such a great family time in December. Water is overpriced to the point we witnessed teens trying to save money and were beginning to show signs of dehydration. Take extra water & do make your kids take extra & fill up at the water fountains that may not taste great but are cold. New ride was good & the line was not as bad as we expected. They do need to work on getting the lines through quicker. Park has potential if something would be done to fix the problems.",MomofKS
20,Has this place gone down hill,Having been to Six Flags several times 10+ years ago I can say this park needs a clean up. The rides are still fantastic but without a Flash Pass (additional fee) it makes it almost impossible to get on very many rides due to excessive wait times. I found some reasons for this by the ride attendants not allowing single riders to hop up to the front of the line to fill lone seats. Also the ride wait lines are not well managed. You pretty much push into the line you are getting into. The park itself was full of trash and looked terrible. The bathrooms reminded me of a unkept high school restroom. I was prepared for some garbage being it is a theme park but after visiting Universal Studios and Disney Land on this trip I can say my standards were a little higher as both those parks are well maintained. I dont think I will be returning to Six Flags after this visit.,Bobbi S
50,Best theme park in the world,"If you're into extreme roller coasters Magic Mountain is awesome! There's tons to do with the kids, big kids little kids you cannot be bored there.

Six flags magic mountain is fun for the family, couple, businesses, and also for schools. The food is great and very delicious, the service is overall well the employees help you when you need it. The rides are safe to ride on and also thrilling to be on. For the smaller ones in the family they have a special place for them which is excellent and safe for them they can have fun and so can the rest of the family. Six flags is a safe and fun place for everyone, in my words if you have never been there you must go you will have a blast and will want to go again.",Edith N
10,"Bad experience, no help from staff.","I will try to make a long story short. Our honeymoon was a Theme Park tour of Southern CA, ending at Six Flags Magic Mountain on the way back north to the Central Valley.Had a terrible experience with a blatant lack of security or attention to customer safety from staff members, and within 45 minutes of arriving decided to leave, and also decided that we wanted to cancel our Season Passes we had purchased that day since we no longer wanted to be in the park or ever come back.Short story is, they will not give you a refund, even if you didn't use any of the park's rides or facilities.Only one of the staff members who ""helped"" us during our 3 hour attempt to get our money back was even remotely polite or helpful.It made sense to her that since it was our Honeymoon, we had not gotten the park experience and just wanted to leave and never come back that we should get a refund.The supervisors however were firm and told us, ""Take the loss of our ticket prices as a learning experience, or just process that passes so you have something to show for it.""We will not be using the season passes we were cornered into keeping, nor will we frequent any other Six Flags parks in the future.",Conner H

40,Family Day at Six Flags,"Spent two days at the park. 7/4 was great, with minimal crowds and short lines. Coaster were all up and operating normally. Generally a clean park and helpful/friendly staff. Missing any place to easly leave your drink cup when you get on a ride, but plenty of lockers (fee) to put your valuables you must carry while in the park, but can't take on the ride. Lots of walking, so be sure to wear something comfortable. The park is built on a hill, so some walkways may be steep. On 7/5, much larger crowd, long lines, and coasters were not operating properly, causing much longer lines than necessary. Great for anyone at least 48"", but also a good sized area of rides/attractions for anyone at least 36"" tall. Not much to do if you are under 36"". Arrive early for best parking and ride experience. Food is pricy, and you can't bring in outside food. Found out from the tram driver at the end of our trip that the large white wooden coaster at the front of the park will be removed this winter to make way for a newer metal coaster. When lines get long, need a better system of moving riders through the ride faster.",JonMC2
20,A Big Disappointment,"Hadn't been there in about a decade - will be a lot longer before I go back.Graffiti rampant, gum stuck to walls. Who knows when the place last got a coat of paint.Doors rotting, fencing broken. Commercials and advertisements everywhere. Non-sequiturs abound - Pistachio Park? Very poor shading for those waiting in line - no cooling stations or misters in operation.Staff was friendly enough - but didn't make up for the trashy vibe.",I-heart-Travel
10,Rides and FLASH PASS,"We were a group of 11 family member including 4 teens which visited the park on July 4, 2013. We bought the Platinum Flash Pass for six people (paid a total of $515 on top of the park entrance fee), which is totally and absolutely useless. You still have to reserve the ride, and if by the time you get to the ride the ridiculous device provided by the park is not ready, they will not let you on the ride, even if there is no one standing in the line. Most rides, even the new rides are not functional. Park is dirty. Bathrooms are disgusting. No assistance available throughout the park. Map and directions are joke. I strongly recommend; do not waste your money to visit this park.",Azi K

10,Very disappointed!,"Return visit for me & husband, 1st for kids--excited to be old enough for ""the good rides"". Turned out to be record-setting heat wave. LONG walk over blazing asphault to & from car (poor shuttle service), very crowded, very little relief from sun--shade, fans, misters, no breeze. Waited 2 hours for ride, packed into cramped area w/mister OFF. People were getting heat sickness, passing out. When paramedics had to haul 2 people away on stretchers, some of us demanded that they turn on misters. We were told they were broken. 2 min.s later they came on. We did not enjoy our ride, and continued to feel worse--pounding headache, nausea. But wanted our kids to enjoy the park, and had spent a lot of money to be there! Went on whitewater ride to cool down, got some food & drink (that was way over priced!), tried another ride--all felt worse. Waited in blazing sun for log-flume type ride. They were only running ONE boat. Many people, like us, gave up & walked away--angry! I was also disappointed to see that the park was dirty & run-down. (Esp. after building it up to the kids for years!) We had no choice but to leave early, after only 3 rides! I suffered from heat exhaustion the rest of the day, in hotel bed w/cool cloth over my head, sleeping. My family was also sick, to a lesser degree. We feel that we wasted our time and money. We have no plans to ever return, and would advice others not to visit the park. **The next day we visited Knott's Berry Farm, and had a fabulous time. (Clean, friendly, shady, some great rides, less crouded, pleasing atmosphere, very family friendly.)",Sharon K

50,"Amazing Thrills, Clean Park!","Wow, if you are looking for thrills, this is a place to go. I read other reviews on Trip Advisor where people were complaining about the staff, cleanliness of the park, etc so I wasn't expecting such a great park. I have nothing but good things to say. The park was clean, I didn't notice anything in disrepair, there are a lot of trees, lines were very short and the rides were awesome. We went on June 29th (while the temp was well over 100!) so I was expecting to ride only a couple of rides due to heat and lines. I initially went to X2 and it was temporarily closed, so we ventured on. As we walked towards the back of the park, we got to the Gotham City area. Very cool scene with the theme of the decaying city as I got in the Batman line. To my surprise, no one was on the coaster (this was a recurring theme). I walked right up and got on the front of the coaster. Same thing with several other coasters. The only ride I waited for at all was Full Throttle and that was about 30 minutes. My favorite ride was the Drop of Doom - thrilling ride and gives you a beautiful view of the park! If you are in the area and can make it, I suggest going. We got discount tickets so it was only 20 for admission for us but parking was $18 (which I thought was a bit ridiculous). Food and drinks were about what you would expect at a park but nothing outrageous. You are allowed to bring your own water in but no other food or drinks. Only wish I was able to ride X2, which was working by the time we left but after several hours in the 100 degree heat, we were ready to go!",WSNCReview
50,Incredible Coaster Park,Will make this short and sweet. This has got to be one of the best coaster parks in the world. From X2 & Full Throttle to Green Lantern (which is impossible to explain what happens during the 30 second ride but it is one of the best rides in the park). Took my granddaughter also and she had a great time in the very nice kids area. Great place for coaster enthusiasts and family. If only family would recommend Disney Resort down the road instead.,sweetbabylee

50,Magic Mountain vs Disneyland,"Magic Mountain is great fun if you can handle scary rides. The majority of the park is for thrill seekers and older children. In my experience we were able to get on more rides at Magic Mountain in comparison to Disneyland. Tickets at both places are expensive, so people should get their money's worth. It was my experience that Disneyland was extremely over crowded; even to the point that walking was hard. You won't have that kind of trouble at Magic Mountain, so if your party can handle scary rides choose Magic Mountain.",Stay462857
50,Full Throttle Staff Member (thank you),"My husband and I were doing the child swap with our 5 year old at the end of the night we were the last ones on full throttle. We had arranged it to where he would ride with my other kids and I would hand off our little one when he finished which means I would have rode on my own. There was this one staff member there a man, was very kind to us he made arrangements so that we would hand my son off to my daughter so that my husband and I could ride together. This was so kind nobody has ever done this for us before. We keep pretty busy with our kids and make no time for us and for a staff member to do this for us without even being asked was very kind and this was an awesome way to end our night. It shows me that there still are kind people in this world. You had an awesome staff member that night I wish I would have read his name but he did an excellent job and I have told everybody about that experience. Life changing moment for us",Momof 3

It was fairly quiet so we didn't have to queue for too long on any rides (longest about 15 minutes due to someone being sick!), I had been before but my partner hadn't, and he was just blown away at the rides.

30,Hot temps + Lack of customer comforts = Avoid at all costs,"As the temps rise the lack of fans and/or misting devices becomes very apparent. Standing 90 minutes in a line for a three minute ride and having the temps in the 90+ degree range is not god for the people. The park is very nice, but with that said it is a ""Six Flags"" and one that seems to spend more on rides than on keeping their guests wanting to stand in lines 90 minutes.Then of course is the extremely high prices for the mediocre amusement park food.",TCPDump
40,"Awesome rides, great day to spend here.","Surprisingly short lines for a mid-summer day (though I did visit mid-week & Tatsu was the only majorly crowded line). Had multiple cars running on almost every ride which made even the longer lines move quickly. Food is a tad overpriced for what you get (ie Mooseburger Lodge), but that's how theme parks always are.Only negative is that our gameplan was messed up when rides like Superman & X2 closed mid-day since we were gonna wait until later to get on those.",James G
50,Six Flags,"The rides were really amazing and fun. The lines were a little long and the food was expensive, but other than that, my Six Flags experience was pretty good.",LarryGuevara
10,Not like it use to be...,"Im disappointed in the Magic Mountains response to the number of people that were fainting in line from the heat. They need to have fans and misters for those standing in a 90 plus mintue line.One lady passed out twice in the same line and both times, all of the people in line requested the ride attendents send over first aid and they said there was nothing they could do and told everyone to go around and just kept loading the ride.All of the people in line were passing water bottles up to this poor lady and when she fainted the second time she hit her head. The Magic Mountain attendant, then attempted to have her sit on a bench that was still toally exposed to the sun and continued to run the rides.Many people that witnessed this, was furious and the way this woman was thrown to the side and left to tend to her side.Point, Magic Mountain needs to spend more $ on misters and fans for those people who take the time to stand in the lines to ride the rides.There were other bad service and issues that we encountered which include a person confronting my family because we watched them being not so nice to some checkers.My family and I, WILL NOT return. Its not the same when I was growing up and its a shame. Go to Knott's Berry Farm or Disney. Its totally worth the extra money to be comfortable.",KimK729
40,great! (:,"the place was a great way to create memories and take pictures with family/friends. it was such a wonderful day, yet very tiring. i regret not bringing shoes, because my feet were killing me. bring lots and lots of money, because the food and drinks are a little pricey, but well worth it. i loved it very much, and i'm looking forward on visiting the theme park again.",Randelle E

50,So much fun!,"Went with my boyfriend and my brother. We don't have any amusement parks like this in Australia! I have never been on a roller coaster in my life, so I went on the 4 tamest ones and the water rides, which were still awesome fun! The boys went onto basically every ride in the park because they have no fear of death ;P We got there before the park opened and left when it closed 8 hours later. It would probably take less time usually, but we went during the last week of school, so there were several school groups there clogging up the lines. The price was extremely reasonable, lots of places to eat and things to buy. The rides are amazing and it was a fantastic way to spend the day!

40,AWSOME rides. poor park management,"Cons: the park starts at 10.30 and there is no cover for the tiket lines . and it was 100 degrees.outside food is not allowed so be prepared to buy a 4$ water or coke.After visiting universal studios and Disney one feels the difference in signage and absence of people to help you. even when my 2 daughters got separated there was no one to help.there are only a cople of places where a person can sit in air conditioning.Pros: the best rides ever. A gold or platinum Fastpass is recomended because it then allows you to go ahead of the lines and allows you to enjoy more rides. i often heard people complaining that normal lines were to long whereas my daughters were able to book rides on the fly with their electronic fast passes whihc got them into the rides in minutes.REach early and book X2, full throtal , riddlers revenge, superman drop Green lantern and tutsu must be tackled while the going is good and crowds are yet to come",Mohitoswal

50,SoCals Best,Visiting SoCal? Consider Six Flags for a fun thrilled day of adventure and excitement beyond any thing you've ever experienced before.

10,You might die.,"When visiting a 6 Flags park know that you are indeed putting your life in their hands. Many of their attractions are poorly maintained, their staff are hardly knowledgeable of safety. You will likely be safety checked by a teenager who couldn't care less if your daughter flies out of her restraint on a roller coaster. You might also be as lucky as we were and have the coaster break down midway through the ride leaving you in a state of suspended terror.",Todd S
50,Hot Day at Six Flags,"i went to Six Flags and it was scorching hot, but it was worth it waiting in the sun to get on the rides cus the rides were so much fun and were soo exhilirating. Thanks Six Flags for the fun. :)",Charisse S
50,FUN,Its really fun especially on hot days when you with your family or friends. The employees are really friendly and they make the park more fun than it is. Its really fun because my 1 year old son could ride on the baby rides.,Stephanie C
40,Great Coasters but not Disney,"If you're coming for the coasters, this is the place. If you're coming for anything but the thrill rides, don't bother. Six Flags is all about the coasters and they are amazing! If you want the whole theme park experience, I would recommend Disneyland. I was here with my two teenage daughters and they loved the rides.We visited in early June on a Tuesday and the lines were long. Whatever the wait time estimated, double it and that would be more accurate. In hindsight, a good strategy would be to arrive in the late afternoon and stay until close for two days rather than trying to cram everything into one day. Many families and school groups leave in the afternoon and the lines go from 90+ minutes to 30 minutes.Also, although the maximum thrill rides look scary, the newer coasters are so smooth they are much more enjoyable than some of the rickety-tickety moderate rides.",FIveIslandFarm

50,Magic Mountain,"I am 13 years old. My aunt took me to Magic mountain because I got straight A+ all year in every subject. The rides are SO fun. The lines are pretty long but it is worth the wait. I only went on the thrill rides however, there are rides for young kids like, the tea cups and water ride. I was reading online about a few hauntings in Magic Mountain. On my trip I did not see/hear anything so maybe you would like to do more research. Go on google and just type in haunting in Magic Mountain. Should pop right up. The park was very clean. I stayed for four days. I also went to the LA zoo. Great family experiences. I stayed at the travelogue hotel. Very inexpensive! WARNING: some rooms don't have hot water. Magic Mountain has a lot of really fun rides. I would not recommend this place if you don't like thrill rides. (most of the park is thrill rides.) This was also my first time going to magic mountain and riding super big roller-coasters. All around, the trip was very fun> I will be coming back to Magic Mountain. A+ theme park!",Marrio2000
10,Horrible Experience,"They treated us terrible. My husband is very tall. They couldn't get the ride harness to click in, so they made him exit the ride. He was so embarrassed. After waiting in line for over an hour. Why don't they post it on the sign at the beginning of the line? Then you would go to a different ride. Then the staff laughed at him. So unprofessional!",Tiffany N

50,Hectic,BEST DAY EVER! As a thrill ride seeker i found these rides very intoxicating. I recommend the X2. It was so hectic I threw up on it. My sister who is 12 found the teacups quite scary.

Its the only way to see and experience Six Flags!",ClintP698
50,The Wonders of Thrill Rides,"Mostly, I come for the thrill rides. What I like the best are the rides because it feel amazing and I love the feeling the ride goes super fast and has twist and loops. The least thing I don't like is that the rides are kinda long only cause some have only one cart working. Definitely bring cameras to take picture of your trip and if you are going to be there all day bring very comfortable shoes. When I visit I would make sure to stay there until the close and go on as many rides as possible. Overall I would say you will have a fun time with friends or family when visiting Six Flags Magic Mountain",Yasmyn R

20,"Rotting, Overgrown, Unclean","I enjoy reading up on the history of theme parks and Six Flags has been one that I have looked into over the years. This is what prompted my most recent visit. My visits have been limited over the years due to the distance I have to drive but this most recent visit was probably the worst I've experienced. The long lines at the guest relations/annual pass booth were bothersome (the other person in my party got his pass this visit) but somewhat expected due to my past visits. The most discouraging element of my visit was seeing the state of disrepair that park was in. Rotting wooden fences and structures were everywhere. The other guest in my party commented on how parts of the park felt like they had been abandoned for years (the areas around the shops in Cyclone Bay, Baja Ridge, and the old monorail station specifically). On every filthy trash can was a sticker telling me, the paying customer, to do MY ""part and have a heart"" to keep the park clean. Only weeks ago I went to Sea World San Diego for my first time since I was a child. I couldn't believe how clean the park was. The cleanliness of the park was only second to the beautiful gardens and plant arrangements. Six flags was the complete opposite. The famous rides I had read about and the ""classic"" attractions were in horrible disrepair. Where there was supposedly once a consistant theme and detailed architecture among areas there were now crumbling structures seemingly held up by the many layers of brightly covered paint adorned with poster board printed signs (the store Flags for example). I was excited to see a unique attraction like the Orient Express in operation. My excitement was dulled by the state of the trolley itself. Inside it was covered in cobwebs and covered in dust and dirt. How am I to believe the attractions are maintained and safe when they can't even be kept clean. Also the method of advertising in the park was so ""IN YOUR FACE"" that it just felt tacky. Portable billboards of the same advertisement would just be lined up next to each other with no thought. All of these things translated to me as this: Six Flags is 100% all about the bottom dollar. And at the end of the day Im sure most companies are but most of their southern california competitors at least do a good job at respecting the paying customer and delivering a quality product that doesn't make this fact so blatant. Head to Disney or Universal, its worth the extra couple bucks.",nhuckabone
10,I would never go here again.,"How can you advertise rules such as, ""line cutters will be kicked out of the park. Spot saving is not allowed. No cursing.""But yet, children are dropped off at the park with no adult supervision. Groups of kids ages 13-18 are saving spots in line pushing you out of their way after you've already been in line an hour. The employees see this happening and say nothing. If you go to guest services all they say is, ""We don't give refunds and there is nothing we can do about line cutters. Next person please!""I would never go to this park again. I'd recommend Disney or Knottsberry farm instead",Justin D
50,Thrill ride heaven!!!!!!,"One of the highlights of my US trip. Being a theme park junkie......I was in thrill ride heaven. The rides were amazing, fast and scary.

Some rides like x2 and Green Lantern were long queues, x2 due to popularity, Green Lantern due to low throughput.Managed to ride all coasters (including two rides on some) in around 8 hoursGreat facilities and lots to do even if dont ride the rides.Reasonable prices for food and drink and very well priced merchandise in the stores on parkOverall great visit and would throughly recommend",PeteGreensmith

50,Flash Pass is worth it!,"We visited the park for the first time. We weren't sure how the Flash Pass would work but it substantially reduced the waiting time on all of the rides. We didn't opt for the Platinum pass (can ride twice without getting off ride) and for the price, I'm glad we didn't. It really wasn't necessary. We visited the park on a Saturday and it was very busy. The Flash Pass is the way to go and I recommend the added expense. You'll get to ride a lot more rides in one day than you would without it.",Azcaren
10,Not Handicap Accessible or Helfpul,"We took a family visit to this park, with my terminally ill nephew who is in a wheelchair. The park staff were rude and not helpful. When we asked if there was a discount, they were extremely impolite. On the one ride that he could ride with the family, the line attendants made no effort to help us ride on the same device together, they made him wait for the next ride. It was a horrid experience. I would never consider attending this dreadful place again.",klbinco
20,Fantastic unless you're with someone in a wheelchair.,"I've been going to six flags since I was a kid and never really had issues. This last time we went we had to people in our party who were wheelchair ridden. The staff was often rude to us. The accommodations that were made in order to allow wheelchairs to access the rides were poor. The walkways we were required to take the chairs down to get on some of the rides were incredibly narrow. the chair barely fit through. whenever someone was exiting the ride while we were trying to get to the elevators, I would have to stop pushing the chair as they tried to squeeze by us. we ended up waiting much longer than the specified wait time for several rides. this was mainly due to a lack of attentiveness on the six flags staff. The roller coasters are fun, however in terms of accessibility respect toward the disabled, six flags needs a great deal of work",Sarah D
40,Exciting But Still Needs Work,"It's been some years since I've been to this park but I was pleased to see the numerous improvements they've made. Saying that they've come a long way is an understatement but they could use some work where it counts.The positive; It's cleaner, the security does their job and makes the park feel safe, there are various methods used to minimize line jumpers, season passes are very reasonable and have many awesome perks and deals. Prices for food and drink deals are very fair for a park. The rides are awesome and there was something for all ages to ride.Negatives; There are a lot of areas that are overlooked for improvement but nothing that lessen the attraction quality but could use a scrubbing and some paint. A few attractions were manned by very immature staff, they spent the loading time playing and joking with each other instead of using the time to check belts and harnesses. A few occasions we were rushed through the safety checks and the staff just barely touched the belts. Jokes were being told overhead and the all clears weren't clear at all and added to the scare factor that they needed to confirm at times up to three times. I took it upon myself to triple check my safety devices. Some of the staff were clueless to things like restroom locations and handicap policies, as well as where to get the info.I do suggest a visit and will be returning with my family.",559MoM
10,Never again!,"This is not the same place as I remember as a child. It was chaos! No line control, dirty and people are RUDE! The misters were not on, the lines ?

10,Staff doesn't care,"I used to love this park. Now it is just poorly run. This park is geared for younger people and not for adults. The map they give you is very confusing and we were constant getting lost.Do not get the fast pass during the week. It was a complete waste of money. Did not save us times on any rides.Even though this was a week day, it took over an hour just to get into the park, and then another 30 min to get the worthless pass.You are going to do a lot of walking up and down the mountain. Other 6 flags parks are much better thN this one.",Ken T
10,Most Horrible Experience for Disabled People,"Many have asked me why I said Six Flags Magic Mountain in CA sucked today. Well, with the nerve issues in my back I have had to rent the motorized wheelchairs or reg wheelchairs this entire vacation due to my back... no problems up till today. Disney, Disney Adventures and Universal Studios have all been MORE than accommodating and wonderful to say the least. Always someone to help/assist when you need them. Today we get to Six Flags; and they give us a pass for the wheelchair entrance; you have to go up get them to initial your paper at the exit (all the way up to the ride operator, not just the beginning of the exit like the other parks)... they tell you what time to return to ride. our 1st roller coaster, we decided to go back 5 min early in case it took time to use the elevator, transfer into the coaster etc so I wouldn't hold up the ride. They said you have 5 min go to back of line and come back. Then we get up there again they said you still have 3 min do it again, then 1 min... WTF... really? So by this time Ryan is PISSED... we go to the 2nd roller coaster and they did the SAME DAMN THING.... wth.. i wasnt asking to get on 5 min early i just didnt want to hold up the ride... reminding you all that i was the ONLY person using a wheelchair at the time, so it was the kids that kept having to go back to the line, climb all the stairs so many times etc. After the 2nd roller coaster; both my roller coaster fanatic boys said mom we dont like how they are treating you cant we just get our money back and go back to the hotel and swim or something. So, we returned the wheelchair, they refused the refund of our tickets (keep in mind we were only there for 2 hours)... soooooo we left w/o making a fuss... will keep you posted as to what corporate does; kruz is ready to go straight to the BBB... i want to give corporate a chance to fix this... since we did spend money on gas/hotel to be here. UGH... will NEVER return to that park again. — feeling annoyed.",JennWagener

50,Best Amusement Park EVER!,"I absolutely loved my trip to six flags!! I felt that the price of a ticket was very cheap, especially for the quality and amount of rides and attractions in the park. The park was very clean and comfortable, with water mist at different areas of the park. Another thing I was very impressed with was the drinking fountains. Usually drinking fountains at amusement parks are disgusting, but this was not the case at six flags. The employees were all very kind and friendly. I would not recommend bringing young children however, because most of the rides are very intense.",Lizzie W
50,Great Experience!,The lines were really short. The rides were very fun to go on and they felt safe to go on them. I would recommend everybody I know to go to Six Flags Magic Mountain.,Rosa H
30,Fun but lacks sole,"We visited Magic Mountain from Scotland on our Honeymoon due to the thrill rides.First of all the rides are very impressive. There are lots of them and when you negotiate long wait times they are excellent.There are a few negatives however.Dont be fooled by the price to get in to the park, its cheaper than others in LA but this is made back should you choose to eat or drink there. The prices are inflated.The queue times are higher than any park we have visitied in the States and it felt like six flags were on a cash making mission becuase as soon as we arrived in the park we were offered various queue jump options, costing $140 which is fairly ridiculous, considerin Disney offer their fast pass system free of charge.The staff were a bit miserable.It's worth a visit. Enjoy.",Gary3434
50,Rollercoaster Maddness,"If you like rollercoasters, this is your park. This park had more coasters than anywhere else I have visited. They also have ""different"" coasters. A stand-up, a ""flying"", and two that you are sitting/hanging on the outside of the track. If you have a Six Flags close to where you live (we have St. Louis) check into buying a season pass because it will get you into all of the Six Flags parks. Our season pass was $5 cheaper than a one day pass at Magic Mountain, and we can visit our park all season long. We drove over 2 and 1/2 hours during our vacation to get here, but it was definitly worth it!!!!",Stermers
50,An epic day of thrills!!,"It was everything I expected it to be and more.We went on a monday so the park wasn't overly busy, longest lines were about 20 minutes.We were able to power around the park and ride every rollar coaster in just under 8 hours and then we rode a couple of them twice!!Each coaster is unique and I recommend trying them all!!Food is typically expensive, tho fuel up at breakfast and make use of the free water fountains and you can get through the day!Tip: Buy your tickets online at least 3 days before you visit, nearly half the price!",Adrian W
50,"Family friendly, clean, amazing rides","FL residents, went to LA to check out this park. The rides were excellent and the park is in amazing condition. Went on a weekday before local schools were out. Had a few school trip groups but otherwise not too crowded. Staff not in a big hurry service-wise, but everyone was remarkably friendly. Would have liked a few more bathrooms for convenience. The inclines were tough for us flat-landers! Would highly recommend for coaster enthusiasts. If you don't ride- don't go....there is nothing else! (lost phone on Riddler's Revenge but got it back after closing)",Yeahbut246
40,What a Trip,It was a terrific way for Mom and Son to spend a few days together. Have to take it a little slow and become acclimated before hitting the super thrill rides.Definitley get the souvenier bottle on the first day and buy wristbands for unlimited drinks for each subsequent day.Plan the day around ride areas and keep track of which shops carry the merchandise for you -- not every store carries the same thing and sometimes you have to go all around the park to locate one item as not all staff know what merchandise are at each store.Eat at odd hours to avoid the longer meal lines.HAVE FUN NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO!!!!,Cheri R
50,Excellent 1st Time,"First trip for our family of 6! Nothing beats your first time making memories with your family at Magic Mountain and Hurricane Harbor!

30,Pleasantly Surprised,"We went on Saturday, June 8th. Our family includes my husband and I and four children ages 18, 21, 24, & 27. I purchased passes online, including the Flash Pass. I recommend the Flash Pass on a weekend. I bought the regular Flash Pass and it was great. By the time we checked into the ride that we had ""reserved"" and finished waiting in line, riding the ride and walking to the next ride, it was almost time to ride again. The park needs to work on how to implement the Flash Pass on rides because sometimes it was awkward with guests thinking we were cutting into the line. You check in with an employee and then they just send you into the line. The Flash Pass doesn't work on a couple of the big rides (X2 and Lex Luther) so plan accordingly. We rode X2 first thing in the morning and the wait was about 45 minutes. We rode Lex Luther about 4:00 p.m. and the wait was only about 30 minutes. I felt like the cost for the tickets and the Flash Pass was comparable to other parks. We were there when the park opened and stayed until it closed and rode on everything that we wanted to plus a couple big rides twice.The park was cleaner than I expected. The employees were not friendly like at Disneyland, but they weren't rude either - just doing their jobs.My husband and daughter had trouble with motion sickness and didn't want to ride all the rides, so if you don't like roller coasters, this park isn't for you. I am scared of heights, so I just closed my eyes when the coaster was on the slow going up the track. It was a fun day.",klmcfarland1

The service was very sullen and unhelpful, hardly any smiles from the staff. The food choice was poor and the service slow and seemed to be unorganised.Apart from this i would recommend going if you like rides but do not expect the type of service you get at Disney or Universal.",davethebear1953
50,Six Flags Magic Mountain,This theme park was the best out of all my experiences in California! The staff are great and positive. The rides are awesome and one of a kind. Also very family friendly!!,Damian L
20,Not worth the money,"With a few exceptions the staff were rude. The rides looked like they needed better maintenance, the buildings looked old and in need of both paint and repair. The bathrooms were dirty with broken stall doors. My wife uses a wheelchair to get around and their system for trying to keep it fair for all riders needs work. Their staff failed to inform us about their system when we first got there and it was on the third ride that we finally even heard about it then had to travel halfway across the park to get the required paperwork. When you get to the ADA access point a staff member writes a time on the paper that you will be able to ride. In almost every case the time they gave was a 10-15 minute longer wait for the ride than those whom we watched come in the regular ""Standby"" entrance. And if you want to ride in the front of a coaster with the ADA system be prepared to wait even longer. If you like wild coasters then this is a good park, just don't expect Disneyland quality entertainment. This is more like an overgrown carnival than a true amusement park.",MoparCzy
50,Lifetime on fun,"I grew up living near Six Flags magic mountain and havin a season pass every year growing up for both magic mountain and hurricane harbor. I have many good memories.I am now 25 and hadn't been to either park and a number of years and I was very impressed wit both parks and how they updated lot of areas and added a lot of new rides. The staff especially impressed me, for the reason being that every single employee i came into contact with was overly helpful and friendly to help me and make sure i was having a great experience which is awesome because at theme parks you would think with the overwhelming amount of employees you would run into one thats havin a bad day or something.

( got a platinum flash pass after that, managed 13 coasters for the day after that.... For someone such as myself from OS & only there for the day, flash pass was pricey but worth it for me....Second downer was the restrooms could have been maintained better throughout the day...started getting smelly & no hand towels by the afternoon & bins overflowing...All in all a great day of coaster riding, think I tried to rearrange my internal organs by days end but well worth it...I'm now well aware that I am getting past my use by date for coaster ridding !!!

40,You like roller coasters? Then come here.,"If not, you might want to try somthing else. This place is perfect for someone like me who pretty much has no interest a jillion different kind of rides. Roller coasters are pretty much it. So, this is NOT the smart choice for a family trip with little kids that want stuff like the tea cups at Disney. Also, the atmosphere can be a little sketchy. Disney this is not. Oh, and just pay the money for the fast pass otherwise you'll spend all dy trying to take 4 or 5 rides if you come during peka times. No fun when it gets hot and it gets HOT here",Chicagolandman
40,Six Flags Magic Mountain CA,"The staff was very Kind and helpful, The park was clean, My friends and I all felt safe in the park and on the rides. The trip overall, was a great experience!",KristaMackRey1994
50,Great day at The Mountain,Havnt been here since I was 16. They have really cleaned up the park as I was pleasantly surprised. We all had lots of fun. Lots of new amazing coasters. Can't wait to go back.,ryanrorick
50,Great Time!,"We visited on June 1st and it was very hot! However we had a great time and as a coaster loving family we had a blast at this place. X2 and Tatsu were the best and the Green Lantern was the most unique roller coaster I have ever been on it and was excellent.We did the Gold Flash Pass which X2 and Lex Luther are not included. It was well worth the cost of the Flash Pass since it was a Saturday we were glad that we had purchased it. However if you are getting the FP be sure to go to X2 First and then go to get the FP. The process for getting the device is long. You have to watch a movie about how it works first. We went to X2 first thing and were among the first to ride (got there before the park opened and waited in line). When we got off X2 the wait was already more than 45 minutes. So getting the FP first would have significantly increased our wait time. As far as Lex Luther the day we were there it didn't seem to be have much of a wait. We rode about 10:30 am with less than a 5 minute wait. I will say I thought the ride was disappointing no different than any other giant drop I have been on.Overall Magic Mountain was very enjoyable. We only rode the coasters and had a blast. The food is standard theme park fare, over priced and just okay. The park is clean but the bathrooms we used were sub par. Dirty and disgusting. That would be my biggest complaint. However not enough to keep me away.For coaster lovers this park is a must do!",mdoyle11
10,Terribly Run park!!,"If you have a problem don't bother asking for help. All the employees will tell you that the ""season employee gave you the wrong information"" Well, who trained the!!! You will never get a customer oriented person to help you. I am surprised they are still in business. It's dirty and the season pass offers no benefits.",Sandy M
50,As good as the Best Amusement Park in the World...,"I'm from Ohio. And in Ohio, we have an amusement park named Cedar Point. It is the Best Amusement Park in the World. As such, I am a bit of a ""ride snob""; I tend to look down upon the lesser parks that the rest of the country has to tolerate as I drive along I-80 to Sandusky.That said, I have found a near equal to my first roller coaster love. And its name is Six Flags Magic Mountain.Could it use some more rides? It could. Could it use a little better line management, perhaps a tip or two from Cedar Fair? I would say so. Should it sell funnel cakes, fresh cut fries, and corn dogs at more than one location throughout the park? It should do so as soon as possible.And yet, does it have some of the most fantastically creative roller coasters on the planet, rides that make me cry out, ""how does Cedar Point not have one of these yet?""This year, my dear sweet Cedar Point builds a new winged coaster. It is tall and fast, and I'm sure I'll love it. But I have ridden X2, which is fast and crazy and ingenious, and has been out already for a few years. And Cedar Point, take note of Tatsu: the next time you want to build something taller and faster, build one of these!I could keep going, but I'll stop here: Six Flags Magic Mountain is so good that my spouse and I are season pass holders, and we have gone four times in less than eight weeks. And we are thirtysomethings. Battered, windswept, hoarse and happy pass-holding thirtysomethings.",TravelvsVacation
50,Grad trip,It was a hot day but a fun day overall. Start your day with Superman ride for warm up. Ended with Lex Luther dip of doom.,kaoz444
50,A park for the thrill seeking older kid.,"On holiday from Australia and did all 5 LA theme park and had to say this was the most fun for a young couple. Firstly their website was very clear and informative, we were able to buy online tickets (saved 35%) and print them at the park (knotts berry farm would not let us do this and charged us full price).We went on a tuesday in early June so the lines wouldnt be as bad. Lines were very good, waited max 20 mins for Tatsu, 15 for anything else. Some rides we walked straight on. We did all 13 coasters and some twice and left early because......we had coasted so much we were feeling ill.....thats when you know you have had a good day. For tourists looking to do another theme park in LA except for Universal orthe Disneyland parks I rrecommend this one, better thrills and more to do than Knotts. Only negative is a couple of the rides are rough on your head/neck (riddler/batman). Tatsu, X2 and Ninja were our favorites.",Beazles1981
50,In a much better state than it was a number of years ago,"I went to SFMM today and I have to say I had a great time. The park is in a much better state than it was when I was last here in the early 2000's.Every ride was running (X2 had a ~2hr or so interruption in the afternoon - not sure about earlier) and most stuff seemed open. I remember last time i was here there was so much stuff just sitting around not open that it looked a bit sad, and it was kinda dirty. Whilst not as pristine as Singapore Universal Studios which I went to last month, it was still pretty nice - i've read some bad things about this place and none of them held true today. Even the bathrooms were respectable late in the afternoon...The place is still incredibly popular so lines can get *long*. I bought the platinum flash pass as I figured that was a drop in the ocean for how much effort it is for me to get to this park (as I live in Australia). The platinum flash was was making me wait about ~2mins on average before joining the queue right at the loading areas. I don't know what the difference would have been with only the 'Gold' pass, but the lines for no pass at all looked very long indeed. I rarely used the ""double ride"" feature of the platinum pass as i always felt a bit mean staying on the rides. The only times I used it was when it was a ride with 4 people to a row, such as Tatsu or Riddler's.I managed to ride X2 three times late in the day (~15min, ~30min, ~1hr waits). I had planned to run there as soon as the park opened but I slept in due to jet lag lol, so I ended up running the park in reverse order which actually seemed a pretty sensible decision as everyone entering the park was heading in X2's direction. The last run X2 was in basically complete darkness in the front row, and it was insane!Food was meh (isn't all theme park food?) and the all the concrete combined with the California sun (and hills! so many hills!) can make it pretty damn hot. I think I spent about $20 on soft drinks - should have just bought the souvenir cup ;).",Tdubs
50,Six Flags,If you like rollercoasters then this is the park for you. Online tickets offer a great value for an awesome rollercoaster park.,Shannon P
50,Awesome,It is a great place if you love roller coasters!!!! I had a blast!!! It is also a great place for young children to!!! Make sure to wear comfortable walking shoes. Also bring money for souviners and great food(funnel cake). It' awesome for all ages!!!,Lexi E
40,lots of roller coasters,"If your kids are too old for Disney, this might be a good stop.The rollercoasters are bigger and faster than Disney. The park is not as good as Disney in managing the lines. Frequently there are empty seats on rollercoasters when there are lots of singles in line. Rides in back of park are shorter. On Thursday at noon in early June, my daughter waited almost two hours for a ride (1.5 hrs in line, 30 mins b/c it broke down right before she got to the front). Most rollercoasters had lines of 15-45 mins wait. Parking is $18. If you like big ""drops"", go to the LexLuther at back of park.",bstcal
10,Season Pass Processing was a NIGHTMARE!!,"I went with my 10 year old to get him a season pass as his grad gift. During the Season Pass Processing, we were treated very rude by Mike a heavy set Hispanic having a bad day, and Micheal who was also just as rude. Mike accused me of being rude, when i was calm and never cursed or raised my voice. When I asked for his supervisor, he threatened to have me kicked out of the park, before I even got a chance to finish our season passes. Guy was nothing short of a Power Trip and if not for my son, I would of demanded a refund. Not the way to treat anyone that just spent $450If not for the Shift leader that came, I would have probably been attacked by this Mike guy.",DMSRacing33
50,Great changes,"I came last year and it wasn't so great. Associates were very rude and really didn't give me the WOW experience that I was looking for. But this year things changed but for the better, I love tht I was able to see security which made me feel more safe, I interacted with a manager meanwhile I was waiting to ride superman and the associates were full of energy .",Mayra S
50,Perfect day!,"Went on 6/6/2013, a Thursday. We literally walked onto half the rides, and the longest wait was about 20 minutes.",Christopher L
50,Magic Mountain Visit,"A little planning goes along way. First off...wear comfortable shoes! You'll do 5-7 miles of walking and if your with a big party perhaps even more for the duration your at the park.Leave all excessive large /purses at home If you dont need them. Some of these rides are so hardcore with twists & turns...there's a reason signs posted everywhere telling you dont take loose items on board or give 'em to someone in your party who isnt going to ride!However if you must bring them, the park offers temp lockers as a nice convenience @ $1 per use, just make sure you hang onto the receipt with the code afterwards.I personally would eat a big meal before you go to reduce the amount of snacks your going to eventually buy inside.Lastly try to go during a weekday during off season to increase your changes on getting on as many rides as possible.It was nice to see all the upgrades and older rides like ""Colossus"" & ""Revolution"" still operational.",Will H
50,a Truly Magical Mountain,"A 5, 11, 42 and 66 year-old spent the day at the Park together and each of us totally enjoyed our visit. From the Ninja, that we all rode and loved, to the kids rides, to Goliath and Superman, the day was truly magical. Get tickets on line in advance and save a few bucks - if not, it is still worth the money!",Charlayne C

50,Magic Mountain,"Get your walking shoes out. Hit X2 first, then Superman. Both of these are incredible and very popular, which means long lines. Lex's Drop of doom is only for the fearless, but awesome. The Tatsu cannot be explained, only experienced. Goliath is a monster!! Avoid Samurai Summit, if you have bad feet or are not able to walk hard trails. Great price for the experience.",Saul M
50,Our first time ever,"The parking and entering the park went smoothly. Getting our membership passes was a breeze. Getting in ten minutes was okay, but it would have been better if it was 20 min. The food was excellent and the portions were more than enough. The drink selection was perfect.",Veronica C
50,Magic Mountain is AWESOME,Magic Mountain was an awesome experience. Something for every age group to do. We enjoy fast roller coasters and Magic Mountain definitely is the place for roller coasters.,Christina A
50,FUN!,"All the rides are amazing (except Green Lantern, my wife loved it). I recommend going to the superhero rides section first (batman, superman, green lantern) and later going to the other area; leave the best to the end. X2 is the best roller coaster I have ever experienced, the fire and sound effects weren't working at the day; though still the best!I cannot understand what people complain about the park! It’s a roller-coaster park; you cannot find other attractions there. As a roller-coaster park thinking about safety and future developments the rides may look far from one another; also the number of people visiting the place is astronomical therefore having all the rides centralised would make it congested. C’mom people WALK!The food served there has nothing special as you expect from a park; it’s more expensive than normal, yes it is. But again, it’s a park and they will take advantage of it keep this in mind.Unfortunately I couldn't experience all rides but I am quite sure the other are amazing too. From what I saw on the website the new roller-coaster Full Throttle will be inaugurated this year.Before you leave your car and check in make sure you remember where you parked your car, otherwise you’ll spend a few minutes trying to find it. When the car park is full everything looks the same.Last tip, buy your tickets on-line and print them before you go.",Leo_Melbourne
50,"Fab rides, but fed up of the ""Discover Card""","We visited 3 times during our trip to LA and have been several times over the years. We upgraded to a season pass as worked out less expensive - $64.99 for one day entry at the gate, but you upgrade this at no extra cost for the season pass - result.The rides are great, but the new ride ""Full Throttle"" was not open yet, but looks great. We go on all the rides, but our favs are Superman and Goliath. well worth the trip from the UK.We did have a great time and want to back right now.We go during the week to try and avoid long queues, but there were lots of school trips this time which make for much anger as the ""little darlings"" do not know what queues are for and were told several times to behave by staff.Buy the Souvenir cup and you get free refills all day - worth it for the heat and works out less expensive, take the cup back the next time and pay $4 (+ tax) to get free refills that day too.However got fed up was being asked at every sale point about the ""Discover Card"" - it got tiring.Also we bought the USB stick to get photos uploaded at $99 a photo which was great we thought, however our USB was faulty and had to be replaced, and thankfully all photos were recovered. However after checking before we left on our last day and being told all were ok, we have returned home to discover that a Character which is meant to be in our hands in the photos is missing from 2 of them making them useless. I am currently trying to email to get this sorted, but I only have 30 days to do this !!! No luck so far, I have received a free download code, but this does not solve the problem - the characters are still missing !!!!",pielander

I would deff come here again!!!",Dessy2891
50,It's always a blast!!!,My fiancé and I enjoy six flags so much! Our last trip we didn't get on any rides due to extreme wind warnings. Even then we had a blast walking around. We bought snacks. They have great pizza for a reasonable price! I recommend everybody to go at least once and have their own experiences. Once you get on one ride you will want to keep going back.,Emily M
50,AWESOME TIME AS USUAL,We went on a Thursday and the longest we had to wait was about 10 minutes! It was really fun! All of the rides were open and running excelenlty! If your scared of heights start with a small roller coaster! Then go on Goliath! Thats my favorite!,Ari L
50,Brilliant!,"This is an amazing park. May 2013 mid week was nice and quiet, had the Premium Flash Pass but wasn't needed due to the low numbers in the park, note it cannot be used on X2. Small crowds made a massive difference here, my last visit was on a Saturday in September....nightmare....got to only ride about 4 rides. This visit I rode every ride at least 2 to 3 times with some quick walking. The landscape can be very incline/decline like so be prepared there. The rides themselves were very cool and whilst the park is out of town a bit, it is worth the drive. If staying overnight, I recommend the Hilton Garden Inn, has a free drop off and pick up shuttle. The rides are primarily big huge roller coasters geared for teens/adults.",RussellBrisbane428
50,Amazing if you love thrill rides - be prepared to wait - don't be fooled by the low cost entry,"So , this park was the cheapest to enter from all the parks we attended (disney, universal etc) but boy do they sting you with food and drinks, much more expensive than the above parks.The rides are amazing, though be prepared to wait, approx an hour or so for tatsu and x2. we spent open to close at the park and towards the end the lines weren't to bad as most people left.My favorite was the goliath, x2 and tatsu. I recommend this if you like thrills, fast rides, and the flying feeling. Fantastic time.",dennismel
50,Ultimate Thrill Park,"If you like roller coaster like I do, look no further. The rides are the best anywhere hands down but the food quality is marginal and pricey. But who goes to a thrill park for food?",RktDogg
40,Maybe in the minority,"My wife & I took a trip to 6 Flags last Saturday (5/25). It was the 1st time in the last 10 years that I visited the park. In my teen years I had LOVED it but as I hit my early 20's it had become a beacon to Gang members. I had heard that the park has made large strides & efforts to ensure a better enviornment so we decided, ""let's give it a go again!"". I was not disapointed in my choice! The rides are still great & the park seemed very well kept. I've read reviews on here about worker morale & park trash but I honestly did not notice any thing like that. The employees were corny in their presentation but no one seemed rude or ""mailing it in"". This park is definatly not Disney, but what is? They have a market and are clearly aiming toward that Thrill Seeker in us all. My only downside to the park is that the Flash Pass is really a joke. If greedy Disney can figure it out without taking our money, why can't Six Flags do the same? Heck, even keep as is but not for the price of an extra admission ($15 would be great)! That being said, this guy felt like a teenage thrill-seeker again (even if my old body felt sore when I left)! I got a season pass & will be returning again.",Spacemonkey49
50,Flash Pass was awesome!,"We decided to use the flash pass and it was awesome. We went on a Thursday before Memorial Day weekend so there wasn't the crowds but there were people waiting in lines. The X2 was a 2 hour wait and we went to the front of the line and got on. The X2 & Drop of Doom was $15 extra. We found we didn't need to pay the extra $15 for Drop of Doom because there wasn't a big line - oh well. I would recommend the Flash Pass for those who want to ride all the extreme rides in one day and don't want to wait. The initial Flash Pass is $105 and each additional one is $80. One person of our group of 3 did not ride very many extreme rides so I may have wasted $80, so plan ahead.",Keith T
20,will not return,Thought we would visit during the week to avoid crowds. Big mistake. Waited in longer lines than at Disneyland. Rides were quite good. just had to wait forever to get on them. Headed straight for X2 fifteen minutes after park opened and waited in line for 45 minutes before giving up. Was told later by people waiting with us in line that it took approx 1 and a 1/2 hours to get on ride. We got on 8 rides in 7 hours. Had been waiting 30 years to go back here. What a major disappointment.,bigred0007

40,Be prepared to walk and wait,"I took my son to Magic Mountain to celebrate his college graduation. We were there all day and walked the entire park. I didn't realize how much walking was involved; good thing we were both in shape!The estimated wait lines for the rides were almost always wrong, usually underestimated but not always. If you find a short line, consider taking the same ride again. We did once, and then returned for more later to find a long line.My son had been there before, and told me his negative experience that 3 or 4 of the major rides had been closed for some reason, all at the same time. A couple hours after he told me this, we experienced exactly the same thing. Four major rides: Batman, Riddler's Revenge, Green Lantern, and Superman all experienced ""delays"" (i.e. not operating) at the same time! Fortunately, we were able to ride them later in the day before the park closed. We managed to ride all of the ""Maximum Thrill"" rides. This was on a Friday; it might be tough to do on a weekend.Ride operators were almost always young adults. They tried not to sound bored, but few were convincing. Despite this, they clearly took your safety as their prime responsibility. No complaints; it has to be tough to say the same spiel every 30-90 seconds all day long!",KendianaJones

40,Great babysitter,It is great to drop off all the kids for the day and not come and get them for 10 hours. Just to get them out of our hair is worth the price of admission,Bob G
50,Go on a Tuesday!!,"The longest my boyfriend and I waited for a ride was about 30 minutes. It was also my boyfriend's first time on a roller coaster, and the people were so great to him. If you have a dog at home, and are worried about leaving him/her all day or finding a sitter, worry no more. Magic Mountain has a free dog kenneling service right next to the parking lot.

10,Trick or treat?,"Well let me start of by saying I'm a roller coaster enthusiast.I travel all over for the thrills from Europe and have been to the Six Flags in New Jersey before.New Jersey was really fun and seemed well organized as a park. Magic Mountain is not of the same standards at all.While the coasters in Magic Mountain is good I think overall I enjoyed New Jersey much moreNow to why my score is so low.The 5 of us in our group of friends bought the Platinum Flash Pass since we had one day to spend in the park and travelled far just to do it all.At no point did the staff give us a tip that we could have saved those $82 pr. person because it was a weekday and there were no lines at all in the park.In fact. We probably lost time getting the Flash Pass due to instruction video and a really long time for the handover of the device.We felt ripped off and complained but they wouldn't hear it.Really guys, you could have mentioned that you expected no lines or at least short ones!Tricking people!",enurweb
40,Great Rollercoasters!,"The day I went happened to be the same day as a few local junior high schools were visiting. Luckily the lines never got that long! There are a lot of really fun rollercoasters here: The X2, Goliath, and Tatsu are MUST rides. I went on each one at least twice. Not to mention Batman, Ninja, and Green Lantern and loads of other great rides. The day could not have been better either. A few of the rides were not running but I still had plenty to do. Food is pricing but that is too be expected at an amusement park. Its pretty far north but it was worth the drive!",UTC_Girl
50,Excellent Guest Relations,"The most well organized, well run and genuinely caring staff I have ever experienced over any theme park I have ever been to. The Guest Relations team, specifically Jesus Davila, accommodated me and my friends above and beyond our expectations. Thank you!!!",Zaahira
50,Great amusement park for visitors from the uk,After our disappointment of knotts berry farm we went to six flags and the difference was night and dayCannot understand why people think the park is dirty we never felt that wayWe went middle of may on a Wednesday and I got on all the big rides by 3pm granted on a few occasions I used the single rider as the kids were not tall enough for some of themThe only downside was x2 being out of action but I can accept breakdowns and closures as part of the normIf anyone is travelling from the uk thin Alton towers but twice as many big rides and minimum wait times the longest I had to wait was 15 minutes granted I think in peak season it would be far more as sometimes it took me longer to walk to the loading station than it did to queue for the rideAll in all great day and what I was expecting from a American theme park,madpartyboy
30,"Long waits, awful staff, dirty, but great rides!","It´s a shame with so great rides is so so poorly mismanaged!! all around the park you get the feeling that nobody really cares about anything. It is a shame, because the rides themselves are really amazing and innovative. The place is dirty and nobody is cleaning. They say the have ""healthy options"" for lunch, well, that is an apple!! The employees operating the rides and serving food seemed to either be incredibly bored or really hated their job.The employees operating the rides and serving food really hated their job, you can see it in their eyes, they were plotting to burn the place down! and they were also so inefficient about everything. I can understand they are a bunch of underpaid kids and high school drop outs, but come on!! just smile a little. The place isn´t much for families or small kids, be prepared to stand in line with rudd and loud teens, and smokers.Again, a shame, you get out of the park thinking about this awful things instead of the rides.",MaluPena
40,Great amusement park,"Been here twice. Once with my classmates and the last time with my husband. Had a blast both times. There are two things you can expect out of a day in this park, a lot of fun and long lines waiting to have that fun. You better get there early and bring your good shoes.The park is big, so there is a lot of people there all day. Bring water and some quarters (you can not bring your bag on the roller coaster, and you have to pay for a locker). A lot of places to eat and drink. The park also have a water-park, Ive never been there, but I guess its something to check out if you got kids.",Kristina
20,It Was Pretty Pathetic,"We brought our two teens (ages 15 and 18). Lots of thrill rides, most of which are favored by younger crowds, but pretty much physically beat up anyone over the age of 35.The park was filthy: trash throughout the park grounds. Trash cans that ironically said: ""Have A Heart Do Your Part To Keep The Park Clean"" were covered in stickiness, food, and spills. The whole day we only saw one elderly gentleman employee sweeping up the trash.Large poles (ones holding up the tracks of rides) were literally caked in a rainbow of gum, I honestly have never seen that much gum in one place, ever.The bathrooms looked like rest-stop or camping/beach bathrooms: stopped-up toilets, wet filthy floors, dirty sinks and faucets. Never saw one cleaning person anywhere near the bathrooms.One kid puked on a ride, and the employee who cleaned it up did so by removing the seat pad and brushing off the chunks onto the ground where people walk!The park was also in disrepair: concrete borders, walkways, planters, and walls had large cracks and huge missing chunks. Paint was chipped and peeling on many surfaces. The rides themselves were dirty, and grimy. The whole place looked tired and run down which did not evoke much confidence in the upkeep of their coasters!Cheesy, large advertisements throughout the park for hair gel, Discover Card, and the like, really cheapened what very little 'theme' they had going in the park, not to mention the bad, lame carnival games.They nickle-and-dime you: you cannot take anything on the ride (purses, etc.) for safety reasons, okay I can understand that, but then they charge you $12.00 to rent a locker. You pay a high ticket price to get in, but then some of the rides you have to pay extra for (racing cars, that free-fall swing ride, etc.). The food was insanely expensive and not that great.We saw maybe one or two families there, but mostly it was 14 - 18 year olds with no parents in sight that were wearing next to nothing (the girls) and were loud and belligerent. While waiting in line, two teens started kissing and foundling each others private parts. In another line, one girl was using a glass pipe smoking weed. Two guys were seen being escorted out of the park for smoking weed which is ironic considering you and your bags/purses are searched upon entering the park. It is a no-smoking park, but people were walking around lighting up cigarettes (and even a cigar) with no employees doing a thing about it.The employees operating the rides and serving food seemed to either be incredibly bored or really hated their job.They feel the need to blast rock music throughout the park (except for the area up by the ride 'Ninja' which was the only quiet spot in the park).We wont ever waste another dime at Six Flags Magic Mountain, and honestly cannot recommend it to anyone, especially when there are better, cleaner, and friendlier theme parks to spend your money at.",JaneAustenFan
40,Espect Long Waits and Big Thrills,"I've been to this Six Flags about five times already and every time I've been there there are long lines, so I'm used to them now. Nonetheless, if you can afford it I would strongly recommend on getting a flash pass to cut the lines (about $40 in top of entrance).The rides: as of 2013 six flags is home to many world record roller coasters and is no coincidence. The rides are definitely some of the biggest, fastest, highest I've encountered. I would recommend going and probably even come back (again) as my kids are getting in the teenage years. They love it!Which reminds me; if you have little kids there are plenty of rides for kiddies too. And if you happen to be here during Halloween season, stay in the kids area unless you want your little ones to get scared.",serrano e
50,Pre-order = Excellent Value for Money,"I'm a theme park enthusiast & this was my 1st time to a US theme park, well worth the $40. In UK, Alton Towers is kind of a rip off with the price & the time it takes to do everything (parking, queuing & walking to next ride). Pre plan your day & you can ride everything several times. Best advice - ride X2 1st as quickly as possible as soon as it opens, I was on 10 mins after opening, as straight after you come off the queue is hours long! Every other ride around the park then has very short waiting times (5-10 mins max) & the park is designed logically to walk onto the following ride round the next corner. I managed to ride 16 times on a Monday without a Flash Pass. I would of prob done 20 if I didn't make the mistake for queuing for X2 straight after. As I went on it again in the last hour twice as the queues & people seem to disappear & go home.Best rides - X2, Tatsu & Superman. Tatsu is a gem of a ride & Superman scares the hell out of you at how fast it goes, in reverse!!",Jables89
10,"Business receives an ""F""","I planned a trip to Magic Mountain with my family and boy was I disappointed. I purchased our tickets on-line for $39 (It's a great family value compared to Disney) and was going to upgrade to the Season Pass, once there. The Park really pushes getting the upgrade while at the park, so thats what I tried to do. Upon entering the park, I was directed to Guest Relations for the Upgrade. I spoke with an older getleman in Guest Relations who has no business dealing with families and the younger crowd. He lacked people skills. The employee re-directed me outside the gates to the Season Pass area because he said I would need to upgrade there. I walked my family to the park exit gates and ten had to go through the metal detector again to get into the Season Pass building. At the Season Pass area, I spoke with a man named ""Terry"" who was nice, but had no clue about his job. ""Terry"" had to ask another employee if they could upgrade me and after getting more information, ""Terry"" redirected me to the ""Will Call"" window at an adjacent building. While at ""Will Call,"" the female employee tried to redirect me to Guest Relations and then told me it would cost another $39 more for the Season Pass (Total of $78). The park has numerous signs throughout indicating a Season pass price of 64.99 and to upgrade your ticket now. Well, after paying the $39 online, it obviously didn't add up to $64.99.In big business, communication throughout an organization is key and Magic Mountain received a firm ""F"" grade. It also appears there may some kind of shadyness with this season pass, if you buy it on-line and then try to upgrade at the park.I recognize that Disney parks are way overpriced for families wanting a day or two a year of entertainment, but I guess you get what you pay for.",Psgutty
40,Six Flags,Great and fun. So much to do and more rides then you can count. A good place to take the kids and even fun for adults.,Doreen G
50,Thrill Ride capitol of SoCal,"This place is about the rides, plain and simple. X2 and Tatsu are still the best. We also really enjoyed superman, Goliath, Apocolypse, Scream and Roaring Rapids. We did ride Riddler and wished we would have skipped it. It's a 20+ year old coaster and the restraints are so narrow near your head that when you go through any bumps your head rocks side to side and the restraints smack against your ears. NOT FUN. It was the only coaster that made us feel queezy afterwards. Yuck. So we skipped all the old rough coasters (Ninja, Viper, Collosis, etc.)We were able to get a hook up with some people to get cheaper tickets and parking and they got us in with early admission and that was epic. We were there on a Friday so lines were light. If lines were heavier, it might have been worth it to get the flash pass, but we did good without. Of course we started our day with a sprint straight to X2. It was reasonably hot there (about 95) so we sought out a sit down place with a/c. We ate at Mooseburger lodge. All the food there was expensive, but this place wasn't toooo painful. at least we were able to find something that was less of a gut bomb.Definitely a fun day.",Trayson H
50,A great day out,Magic Mountain had the title of roller coaster capital of the world. And rightly so. the place does not disappoint! As well as the old looping favourites try =Superman escape from Krypton and X2 which has to be the best coaster on the planet!,sprouters
50,**AWESOME DAY OUT**,"This is our 2nd visit to Magic Mountain - it is a great parks with fantastic rides.We did feel the opening hours were quite short compared with other parks (10.30am til 6pm on the day we visited) - it would have been nice to have another hour to ride some of our favourites again. Queue times were pretty good, except for X2. We did purchase the gold flashpass - and was it worth it???? I would say it wasn't, but can see where it would be if the park was busy. We did not really get any great benefit out of it at all, and you could not use it at X2 (you had to pay another $15 each if you did). We had already paid the park entrance fee (good price) and the flashpass (very expensive) so did not want to fork out another $60 to shorten our wait time on X2. Also the whole system of the flashpass seems a bit chaotic - you are entering where all the riders are just exiting. The front of line pass at Universal Studios is so much better - separate queues and runs alot smoother. I think the flashpass needs some fine-tuning. Had I known the park was not that busy, I would not have purchased the flashpass and maybe the park needs to make them unavailable on low season week days (that is what Knotts Berry Farm does) as it is a waste of money.But in saying all that, the park is heaps of fun and the rides are incredible. Would definitely come back again.",SunloversSouthland
50,Best amusement park for extreme and varied rides!,"The variety of rides at Magic Mountain is mind-boggling - a stand-up coaster, a drop ride, a zacspin coaster, water rides, the innovative X2 coaster, and more! The park is so well laid-out that we were discovering new coasters around every corner. If you're an extreme ride fan, this is the place to go. The park is very well-kept and everyone we spoke to was very helpful. May seems to be an excellent time to go because the line-ups were minimal. Often we could walk right onto a ride without waiting, even on the more popular ones like X2 and Goliath. The food prices are fairly high - $16 for 4 chicken fingers, fries, and a large drink - but that seems to be the norm at amusement parks. All in all, an incredible and highly exciting and fun experience.",dynahthirst
20,flash pass trap,"Be careful with flash passes. Take your time and make sure it is worth it, because they will lie their butts off to sell you the pass. I stood in the x2 line for 1,5 hrs, went straight to the flash pass office, the guy there kept making the 1 hour line examples but refused to give any fact based info about actual lines. I ended up with a useless pass - x2 was the only ride with a line and you could not reserve your place on it. No refunds! The line on x2 was probably there on purpose - only one train running on the first big ride closest to the entrance and flash pass office.",Julljus V
40,Great Place for the Kids,"The rides, especially the roller coasters, are all nice and if you get there early, it is not very crowded. The longest we waited was about 15 minutes. It also isn't very big, so it is easy to get around the park. I wish there were more shows, especially at night. We watched a hypnotist comedian last year, but this time there were no shows, just cheerleading competitions and music awards.",Moshire
50,Amazing Park!!!,"A must if you are planning to visit LA.Rent a car, drive 45 minutes (if you can on weekdays) and enjoy this amazing park.",Pawel_BA
50,So many roller coasters!!! What a great day we had!!!,"My family all agreed that this was the best day of our trip. The lines weren't so long and we were happy to be together while waiting anyway. This kids made up some fun games and we played trivia and learned about eachother while waiting in line. THE PARK IS AWESOME. We had a blast. Thankful for the tip from our friends to arrive early and stay late. We spent some $$$$$ on this day, but it was a day full of memories. My son said it was the best day of his life.",Stanley S
40,"Great coasters, if a bit pricey","On holiday from the UK driving through California and Nevada for two weeks. We wanted to do a theme park in the LA area and having been to Disney and Universal in Florida a couple of years ago were looking for something a bit different. A friend suggested Six Flags Magic Mountains so we thought why not. We had to buy our tickets on the day at the full price as Six Flags would not accept credits cards or PayPal from outside the US. That said, it still costs about the same as a trip to Alton Towers but £14 to park as well. We went on a quiet Friday and there were no queues, in fact, on some rides we were asked of we wanted to go around again.The park itself is a roller coaster junkies dream. At least seven high octane coasters with some tamer ones thrown in. Not really much for the younger visitors apart from the Bugs Bunny area - really aimed at the older market.The park looks a little dated in some areas but it was a good day out. However, seeing the extra queue lines, on a busy day I suspect that you would get on many rides for your money.",Upxc32
50,The best theme park I've been to,Great ride after great ride. We were there on a quiet Tuesday so there were no queues and we got on everything as we wanted.It's a park for big roller coaster lovers. X2 was the top ride.The park is slightly dated and doesn't offer a lot away from the coasters but the great rides make up for this.,Ramsey0504
20,The Least Desireable Park in Los Angeles,"I find it truly disappointing that the visits to the park are not an enjoyable experience and are often filled with misadventures. Either I am the most unlucky person alive, have higher expectations or am the only person to actually take the time to state my opinion. I am a first time season pass holder and can honestly say that I would be hard pressed to purchase one again next year. I have season passes to Disneyland, Universal Studios, L.A. Zoo, Huntington Library, the San Diego Zoo/Wild Animal Park and the Santa Barbara Zoo and do not have issues with those places and have never had to complain. The fact that most of my experiences at Magic Mountain have been flawed or just not fun is amazing since my expectations are really not that high nor from what I believe unreasonable – all I expect is a fun issue free day. Had it not been for the fact that Magic Mountain is ten minutes from the house I probably would never come back.Here is a quick rundown of the issues:1. When customer service tells me that I need to go out of the entrance across the waiting area to the season pass processing id center, I find it disturbing that I am not allowed to exit through the entrance and am told to exit the park and then come back in through security once again. This is not the easiest of things to do since a) I had three kids and two strollers that we have to get through the lines with the multiple diaper bags and all and b) the lines are long and it was hot outside. Why would you force me to go through all of this trouble to rectify an issue that YOU created by not doing things right?!?!?!? Seems kind of unfair to waste 30 to 45 minutes of my time with having to go out and back in and such. Issue was never resolved since I did not wait in line to get back in.2. The lines in the children’s area were short yet they were not moving due to the fact that the employees were goofing off and letting the ride(s) go out half empty. There is no excuse for a line of 10 to 12 people to take about 30 minutes to clear. Either more people need to work the area to make it more efficient or better processes need to be implemented. Having one person work some of the rides is less than optimal and makes for a VERY long wait and visit.3. Getting on one of the rides, my wife smashed her head (left side right below the eyebrow) causing a gash wound that was bleeding on an exposed bolt/nut. Magic Mountain needs to have processes in place for when this happens and perhaps some sort of policy. The fact that even so much as getting a napkin to hold to the cut was a chore is amazing! One would think that in such a park that Band-Aids or napkins or towels would be easily available. My wife is quite attractive though with a swollen black eye, thanks for your help in getting this done.4. Why is it that there are always exposed wiring in the park? Is there no pride in the appearance of the park? When one walks into a store in the main entrance area it would be thought that Magic Mountain would want to make the best appearance possible. In the entrance to the stores are theft deterrent machines that are a) held together with tape b) have wires dangling out of the bottom of them and c) are way too close to each other making it damn near impossible for a double stroller or a wheel chair (ADA Compliant?!?!?) to pass through without smashing the machines.5. Kodak still has never addressed or resolved the issues that I had with the pictures from my first visit! I still have a great picture of my family standing there in the entrance to the park holding out our hand with an excited look on our face holding NOTHING in our palms on the expensive jump drive that I seem to have bought for no reason!",unathan1
50,Brilliant day out and great rides,"We visited as part of our trip around California. We are big into theme parks and roller coasters and Magic Mountain didn't disappoint. We have been to many theme parks all over the world and some of the rides at Magic Mountain are amongst the best we have been on. As we were only there for the day and we had saved money with a free ticket to get in we decided to buy the fast pass system to get to the front if the rides so we didn't miss anything. This was a great buy (albeit expensive) and we managed to go on everything. The rides and selection of bug white knuckle rides was great and something we loved.We don't have kids but would imagine that there isn't a great deal to do with younger kids, it's definitely a lace for older kids, teens and adults.",Mr_MrsBeckett
40,Perfect for the adrenaline junkie,"Have to say, I personally am getting a bit too old for this but my teenage daughter and our family friends love the place and insisted I came along. I'm more a Disneyland aficionado, but what the heck- we're on holidays and we wanted to try something different!! Our friends are from the southern California region so they invited us to spend a day with them here. This is one place that draws the youth and even I was tempted to enjoy a few of the rides on offer. The entry fee is reasonably priced and the thrills are indescribable and varied. We arrived very early and got there before the crowds, many of whom are locals. I sat out on the X2 ride and politely offered to hold everyone else's' bags :PBy the end of the day, we only managed to ride about 7 roller coasters, but that was doing well, according to our friends. Given we had plenty of rest breaks for food, drinks and recovering our equilibrium. It was a thoroughly enjoyable day.",PhoebeNJ
50,"Great Value and Best Coasters, but you have to be into coasters.","Best thrill rides ever!! We arrived at Magic Mountain first thing on a Tuesday morning. No Crowds, weather in the high 60's and all the rides we wanted to try out were open. Food is a rip off but that's expected. I was amazed at how clean it was, not sure why but I thought it would be a big typical dirty amusement park with loud teenagers and garbage but happy to say it was in great shape. Our first ride was Goliath and the rest of the day stayed just as intense. After 7 hours of no line ups and mulitple coaster rides we were done. Magic Mountain won....we were wiped out.",kpattison
40,Old style rides but OMG!,"We visited a couple of weeks ago, on a Wednesday. Minor irritation to start with was getting to security to be told to return our drinks and ""crisps"" to our vehicle. You are only allowed to take in water and fruit. Six Flags - MAKE THIS CLEARER ON YOUR WEBSITE. Within about the first hour, we had been on X2, Tatsu and Viper. My husband and I have never felt so sick in all our lives! Honestly, we felt awful. Our son felt fine! We had a rest and he had something to eat (we couldn't) then we took it in turns to go on another couple of rides before we held our hands up and surrendered. We were beaten. No more! The park was very quiet, waiting times minimal. My hubby won a Kenny! Funny carrying that through the airport to the UK! LOL! We purchased our tickets on line and saved $75, well worth doing if you can.",Trumpster175
50,Excellent selection of thrill rides though some are a little rough,"Went to see this theme park on a Thursday in April. It was fabulous that there were not large lines since we were off season in the middle of the week however they do close at six. I have a Six Flags season pass from a park near my home so we were able to use that for admission to get into the park.Some of the rides were rough. The Riddler and X2 fling you around pretty good. I mention this for those who may have medical conditions that are aggravated by this sort of thing. They have a lot of great rides that are not rough. If you go here you are sure to find something that you like. My daughter who is not a thrill seeker liked the carousel, the dippin dots and the bumper cars. They also have go karts but it costs extra to ride the go karts. My son went on all the extreme coasters.",Wendy B

20,Great Rides - Poor Value - Avoid Weekends,"I have been coming to Magic Mountain for over 25 years. I have experienced the growth of the park over the years, and I believe the park has the best rides, and plenty of them.This visit for me was the worst I have ever had, and here are the reasons why:- Line Cutters - There are signs saying line cutters will be removed from the park... I reported over 100 incidents of line cutting to park employees and security, and they said they didn't see it and could not do anything about it. The one instance where a park employee actually confronted a group of line cutters, he approached them speaking English, and they (Hispanic looking people) responded in Spanish, which he did not speak, so he just shrugged his shoulders and walked off. Moral of the story, pretend like you cant read or speak English and you can get away with anything in the park.- 2 hour lines - I was at the park for almost 11 hours... And I got on 6 total rides... 5 big roller coasters, all of which took 2 hours to get on, and one small ride which took 20 minutes. Many of the big roller coasters only had one car running, making the lines move super slowly. Paying almost $70 to get in the park to ride 6 rides is unacceptable.- Overpriced fast food - I brought my Girlfriend, and for the 2 of us to eat poor quality fast food, it was $40. Not to mention we were in line to get lunch for 30 minutes at 3:30pm. Lines were twice as long around actual lunch time.- Flash Pass - After spending $70 to get into the park, I find out that people who pay an additional fee get VIP Treatment, including front of the line privileges, and no need to wait in line, PLUS they can ride the ride TWICE without waiting in line even once. The best way to alienate your customers is to tell them that their hard-earned money is only good enough to get them in the gate, if they pay double, then they are better than everyone else.Maybe I just happened to go on the worst day ever.... Maybe not. I know that I did not feel like I got value for my money this time around. As a teenager who grew up in the same town as ""Magic"" as we called it, we went 20-30 times a year, and always had fun. Now I just do not feel like the value is there. I will likely go back, but not on a weekend and certainly not anytime soon.",CoolioCali
50,Roller coasters all over!,"Well, for me hard to say anything, because I am sick of those stuff. But we came from Hungary to see that and my ""little"" sons (20 and 22 years) really want to go there, so what I can I do, I took them and spent a lovely day there. We enjoyed every moment there, boys try all extreme crazy attractions. Definetely you need a full day there. We have been on a quiet summer day, I think with about 30% capacity, but all rides been open. Also even it was a quiet, but hot day, some rides they wait for 15-20 minutes. Ok, if I remember I have set on 2-3 moderated water slides. Perfect family program or party time :)",nyuciful

There is less lines on the big roller coasters because mostly families come during the vacations, and they mostly ride family rides.

At the end of the daythe lines were alot shorter. Food was O.K..

I don't remember the exact price. But after 3 visits it paid or itself. And it included parking and pretty much a coupon every month to bring a friend for free or half off. Now going to this place one single day, with the high entry fee and long lines SUCKS.",otev915
30,Misses the Point...,"First of all I have to confess that I LOVE Six Flags Magic Mountain....always have, always will...however there are a few things that ALWAYS leave me hungering for more and not always in a good way...The park is one of the top ROLLER COASTER THRILL RIDE amusement parks in the world today, but you don't really get to experience very much. For the second time in two years we were not able to ride a satisfying number of thrill rides! The park opens late, closes early, rides are shut down due to malfunctions, there is WAAAAY too much walking up and down hills to get to the entrances, PLUS every ride queue we were in had a inncorrect ""wait time from here"" length of time....Net result was 7 coasters, 2 junior rides, almost got to ride Lex Luthor (THREE TIMES in line, THREE TIMES turned away because it wasn't running right) just how much of our day was spent trying to get onto rides...oh about 75%!!! In particular just to ride one coaster (Riddler's Revenge) we were sucked into a line that ""boasted"" a 30 minute queue only to wait exactly 1 hour and 57 minutes before we were finally boarded! I understand the park is popular and that waits are the norm but really what good is it to have more than twenty thrill rides when you can't even ride ten??? This being said I will still visit Magic Mountain and I will still enjoy the rides!!! My advice PLAN your day around the rides you must go on, and if there's enough time you can ride on more....",karpurkia
50,AWESOME!,"Roller coasters, roller coasters, and more roller coasters! What's not to like? We have 4 boys from 4 to 12. We had a great time.

The older boys definitely had more rides to choose from, but the wait times could be up to an hour.",Paula K
50,lots of fun for everyone,It's nice that they search your bags just like at Disneyland. We were with a group of kids from the high school and our families. The teens and the little ones had fun on this trip. They have rides for everyone. The best part is that they let you switch to ride when the kids are too small to go on the ride. They are very understanding about that. We were there during spring break and it was the best time to go. Not too busy since everyone has their break at different times around here. They had a great deal for season passes also.,Susan F
50,Rollercoasters are off the hook!,"My family had a great time at this park, even my 10 year old, the rides were great. Not too much to do if you're not into rollercoasters, but if you are, you are in for a treat! I practically threw my neck out screaming so loud. Lines weren't too bad. Bathrooms were clean. Food is VERY expensive. The best bargain? A superhero cape for five bucks! Better yet, play the water squirter game near Tatu(?) ride and every player gets a free cape of your choosing (winner gets a fancier cape). My kids, even the teens, wore them all day long, both days!",BKroadtrip

Waited one hour for a ride on a roller coaster which was a lot of fun but was not going to wait yet another hour for another ride. Typical prices for drinks and food at a amusement park such as this..expensive...$6 or so for a coke.

50,great roller coasters,"This park is so much fun all the rides are amazing and thrilling.Make sure to check calendar for when they are open. At random times during the week, they are closed.Also If you are only there for a day, invest in the flash pass to avoid long waiting lines.",Tümay K
20,Such a let down,"I was so sketched out when we first arrived that we had to go through metal detectors. My friends and I rode on the viper. When I got on the ride my seat restraint didn't go down all the way. The guy checked my seat and didn't say anything so I was falling out of my chair the entire ride which was extremely frightening. The ride was so poorly made my head was banging around everywhere. The rest of the day my friends and I just sat around because we all had the worst headache from that ride. The staff was all so rude. They all seemed annoyed and no one was friendly. The didn't properly check anyone's safety before the rides. On a ride where you stand up, ALL of my other friends got stuck in their seat too high up and their feet were not touching the ground. They said the whole ride was uncomfortable and they were scared for their safety and angry that the employees didn't even care that they were not in their seats the right way. The whole park was extremely dirty. I have never wanted to leave a place so badly because I felt so dirty. My friends and I had a horrible time, we all didn't feel good because the rides were so badly made our heads hurt and we just wanted to leave as fast as we could. I would not recommend this place to anyone. I expected so much more from this place. I didn't expect a sketchy, unsafe and unfriendly park.",UAanon
40,Spring Break trip,I really enjoyed the park. It has plenty of shade and places to rest and relax. Lots of food choices for all different budgets. The rollercoasters were amazing. We purchased a regular flashpass to avoid the lines on our first day and it was well worth the money.,clanbaird
50,Fun coasters!,"Went during the week so lines were not too long on the older rides. Some of the newer and more popular ones was around 1hr which was to be expected. I wish hours were a little longer during spring break as we could barely get everything ""rode"" by the time the park closed.Food of course is expensive and not many choices. I would recommend buying the refillable bottle (15.00) and getting the free refills all day long. It pays in the end with soda and water costing around 3-4 bucks.If you like coasters then this is the place to go. They had a good section for the little kids so they wouldnt be too bored.",Poobis
40,Love this place but last experience wasn't too good.,"I go to this park annually and most of the time the experience is great, but some days, things just aren't too good for the park. I usually go there around spring and summer however The last time I visited was around January. I'm thinking that the quality of the park depends partly on the time of year you go. As I went in the winter (on a day when it was suppose to rain no less. Luckily it turned out to be sunny) the park was pretty much completely empty. My friends and I were literally able to simply walk onto X. One does not simply walk onto x. We traversed through the line and walked right over the lane for the front seat without a soul between us and the ride. That was nice. However, there was also a lack of employees and quality. It seemed as though they were budgeting themselves because of the slow season. There were compromises like turning off the flamethrowers for certain rides and only running one train on some rides. I was able to watch them take a train off of revolution which was cool. Most of the food and game stands were closed throughout the park. The park just seemed dead and there was a lack of the quality they usually present. (not like there is much of it to begin with but its ok) Also since the everything was wet from prior rain, the park smelled very bad but that is not usually the case. If you go at a good time of the year, you will have a pleasant experience. Just prepare rape shields for you wallet if you are on a budget. Everything is absurdly overpriced but it is not impossible to conserve your money. Get one of those 10-12 dollar cups for free refills and you're good all day for taste beverages. GET YOUR MONEYS WORTH!!! Those soda dispensers with huge plethora of flavors are around the park and they are very cool. improvise on food. I either get an 8 dollar burger and fries meal without a drink as I already have my refill cup, or I eat a big breakfast that last me through the day, (Thank you Bravo Burgers in Chino Hills for your supremely delicious and filling breakfast burritos) and then after a fun filled day of thrills, and exercise, I head over to the legendary In-N-Out Burger a few exits down the freeway for a perfect in to a great day in sunny CaliforniaNow for some tips and advice from my experiences for anyone who is planning to visit Magic mountain.. (Tourists should consider these tips)This park is mostly for thrill enthusiasts. Still good for little dare devil children much like I was. If they are 48 inches then they can ride a lot of the great coasters. Plus there is a cool children area. I enjoyed it when I was smaller. Especially the room with all the balls. I loved that room when I was a child and I just confirmed upon my last visit that it is still there. Smart people they are not to get rid of it.Spring and summer are the best seasons to go. Try to go on a week day as the park will be significantly less crowded than what it would be during the weekend. During weekends, the park is swamped. Lines will be very long and there may or may not be preposterous waits. Lines for food move very slowly.Try to get there early. I usually aim for 30 minutes before the park opens and I get to the parking lot as people are just being let in.Try not be bring to many things to carry as lockers are expensive. Even carrying a purse or jacket around the park will be annoying because they do not let you leave anything at the ride station. There are 1 dollar lockers that they try to force you to use. The last time I went there, they were allowing us to leave things at the stations again and I noticed that some of the ride lockers weren't even there anymore so they may have gotten rid of that rule. I'm not sure though, that may have just been a slow season thing. Remember I went in January and the park was pretty lifeless.There is a Wendy's restaurant down the hill from Magic mountain, just off the freeway. Try not to miss it. The restrooms are pretty clean in the morning and they may be the last clean restrooms you will see until you leave the park. Who knows though, maybe the park janitors won't be lazy the day you go.. It is also good to grab a bite if necessary before you enter the park because your wallets will be raped if you don't have rape guards up.Apply rape guards to you wallets. If you are low on cash and you aren't prepared, your wallet will be raped and it will not feel good. Although of course, its not rape if you except it willingly. Some people just have paper to spend and so the spending doesn't phase them.They smack you over the head with a fifteen doll hair fee for parking.Although everything is expensive some things seem to have better quality then what you would find elsewhere. For example, I bought a Snickers ice cream bar. It was 4 dollars. But My goodness, was it delicious and satisfying. The drinks are ultra fresh with perfect carbonation. I bought and expensive [--] chocolate milk shake from a Johnny Rockets stand... G** D****... Best milk shake I have ever had in my life. Perfect in every way. In comparison, try buying some Sprite or Dr. Pepper at your local 7-11 or McDonalds. Its just not the same. I bought a Snickers ice cream bar from a store. It was lacking. I don't think the Johnny Rockets Milk shake at a regular Johnny Rockets even had the same quality. Now, while I like Magic Mountains own food (Burger and Fries is all I get there. I don't know about anything else) I'm not sure that I can say that the higher quality food extends to that category. It only works with things that you can find elsewhere. Things like name brand Soda, ice cream and maybe candy. There funnel cakes are VERY good but you will be standing in line for a very long time if you choose to purchase one at the end of the day when everyone is leaving.By a Refill cup for 10 dollars or so. Not sure how much exactly. Ultra convenient.Tatsu and X are the most popular rides there. If you get there early enough, it would be wise to ride one of the two before the lines get long.If you have testicles, I would not advise you to ride Green Lantern. That may sound like immature none sense but its real. Just don't do it. Watching people on the ride doesn't do it justice or convey the lack thereof. Just walk away from that [--]. You know what.. Just don't ride it period. No one should ride that thing. It is not good at all. The only excitement I had was from the fear of how bad the next movement would be. I wasn't even able to fully understand how bad it was after one ride. After having been assaulted the first time around I got of the ride and stood confused for a moment. (keep in mind I was with 3 friends and we all had the same reaction) I thought, ""This is absurd. the ride cant be that bad. I must have done something wrong, been strapped in too tight or something."" I had to experience it once more to better understand what had just transpired. I was able turn around and step right back onto the ride since no one else was there. I did so foolishly. On each of the cars there are 4 seats. Two facing forward, and to facing backwards on the other side. The Sets of seats aren't facing each other, they are back to back and separated by a some distance apart, separated by the large structure that is the car. The car spins freely. it isn't controlled like the cars on X. I didn't know this at first. The first time I rode it, I was facing down most of the time because my partner and I were heavier than the two people behind us. All my weight was against the bars with most of the pressure against my core with my legs dangling. No support from anything. Just pressure against my core and genital region with the ride yanking and thrusting violently with hard twists and abrupt braking. The ride was simply very unpleasant. So the second time around I decided to sit on the back side expecting my weight to be nicely distributed on my back and bottom, allowing me to sit comfortably and appreciate the ride. That was when I realized that the cars tilt was not controlled and that it twisted freely. As the car proceeded up the list the car began to tilt so that my weight was once again distributed uncomfortably on my front side. Both My experiences on the ride ended up being equally unpleasant. None of us had positive experiences on the ride although we screamed and grunted and laughed because of the pain and intensity. The ride was so bad that I had fun. And that's not good. And yes.. That whole essay was necessary to convey the sub par experience of the ride to you good people. You can go ahead and ride it as everyone may have different feelings for the ride, but just be prepared for and assault on you body. It's like the ride is mad at the world because it breaks down all the time, and so it fights you.Stay hydrated. I can be very hot in Valencia in the summer. You can bring water into the park but only if it isn't opened. Water bottles at the park are expensive, and as usual, drinking fountains are suspect to some individuals. I have no problem with them and I happily drink from them without any negative effects. Some fountains though... No bueno.The smaller rides are like Revolution and Gold Rusher and ninja are good fun. Especially with large groups of people. We will do something like ride Gold Rusher and scream very loudly and obnoxiously, unnecessarily just to laugh. other riders seem to get a kick out of it too. Just saying, don't skip out on the smaller rides just because they aren't huge thrillers. They can be fun too.Viper is fun but you may get a headache. It is old and rough.When riding Apocalypse (Formerly Terminator Salvation: The Ride) sit in the back. You experience a very fun whipping sensation and if gives the best sense of speed.The park is big and you are on a mountain. (Magic Mountain) Where some shoes that are comfortable to walk in because you will be walking a lot up and down hills and if will not be fun. Unless you are like me and enjoy the exercise. It is also hot and you may start sweating so light clothes are probably preferable. I have seen people get heat strokes there so don't take this lightly. Remember that aqua.Don't be afraid of the rides. No one gets hurt at Magic Mountain. Except for the fools who decide to hop fences and walk toward the tracks while the rides are running. Use common sense.There are two water rides that they have running right now. Avoid roaring rapids if you don't want to get wet which is usually what I do but one day it was hot and I caved in. It was very fun. especially the suspense when you are afraid to get splashed. I had on two layers of shirts and shorts so I just stripped down a layer and I was dry again! On the other water ride you hardly get sprinkled so don't worry about that one.New coaster coming out around July 2013. Looks good. Hold off on going if you can.They have improved security and you don't really see gangsters or anything there anymore like you did back in 2005. At least I haven't and I go once a year so..They changed management a few years back so a lot has changed. park is cleaner, safer. rides have better presentation.Tourists, after you end your day at six flags, there is an In-N-Out down the a few exits down the freeway towards LA. A good way to end the night in California.I'm a 21 year old male. I go wish friends, not with family anymore.",BenJamin E
50,Best rides,We arrived at the park as it opened at 10.30 and we were able to complete most of the extreme rides by lunch time but on hindsight we should have done Superman and Tatsu first as they appeared to be the busiest although we still only waited 45mins. Of all the rides I would rate X2 followed by Tatsu as the most extreme and scary! This park has the best rides I have ever experienced but what you gain in ride quantity and intensity you loose in attention to detail and some areas of the park look worn and threadbare.,Robbie B
30,Coasters!!,"This park has been around for decades, and it's beginning to show in buildings and restrooms. Coasters still impress. Though by afternoon the lines were all over an hours wait. Food at Johnny Rockets was overpriced and undercooked. It was gross. Still, if you love rollercoasters Six Flags is the place to visit. Tip: splurge on valet parking. And be prepared for metal detectors on admission.",ksjr2007
40,That Was Awesome But What's With The Food?,"CALLING ALL THRILL SEEKERS!!! Magic Mountain is by far the best thing that ever existed for people that love roller coasters. The rides are all in good shape and the thrill of all of them are amazing. I was not disappointed in any of the rides I went on. Magic Mountain is also great for families since they have a section for little kids and list all the family rides on the map that they provide. The people working the rides were very kind and a lot of them worked fast except a few. The only down side is that the lines are at least an hour long. If you're planning on staying for a short period of time, I wouldn't expect to get too much done so get all the major attractions in first. I would most defienatly buy the Flash Pass if you are going on the roller coasters no matter the cost since the lines are so long. Other than that, the rides were amazing and made our Six Flags (Elitch Gardens) look pewny.The food service was horrible though. Seriously what's up with the workers? They were very slow and there were huge lines waiting for all the food places. Also, the prices are very unresonable so be prepaired to spend a lot if you have a big family. The Coldstone by far was the most frustrating thing in the world. The cashier asked multiple times what my order was. I kept saying The Pie Who Love Me three times and then the fourth time he asked if I had ordered apple pie. It was ridiculous. Finally, when making my ice cream the workers went at a pace of a slug. The ice cream was melting on the counter and there was five of them making the ice cream. Also I ordered a waffle cone but they ran out so I needed to get a refund. The only thing good about the expierence was the manager was yelling at them and it was very entertaining because they had to hear what was coming for them.Overall though, Magic Mountain was very entertaining and I would recommend coming here.",DougCuellar
10,Don't waste your time or money!!,"My husband and I brought our 14 year old and her friend. We were so disappointed. Because there weren't amazingly huge crowds like Disneyland, we thought things might go faster. Not!!! Terrible ride management. A few teenagers running each ride means huge wait times and intense heat. The lines for the food may look short too, but don't be fooled. One person ahead of you could mean a ten minute wait for pizza. And they will dare to ask you to sign up for a Discover card after the ridiculous wait and cost.They are selling you every minute you are here. The company must be in trouble.The few roller coasters they have and are open are really good, but a 5 to 20 second ride is hard to make up for the ridiculously long waits.My husband grew up coming here and was excited to show our daughter. Sadly it was a disappointment.Bathrooms are soooo dirty!!!They want your money, but will not give you anything worthwhile in return. Stay away at all costs unless you are a teenager with nothing better to do than wait in line all day.Oh ya, and the 2 hour traffic to get here and back just topped it all off!!",Ybfthvdv577754
20,All Roller Coasters,"We went the Saturday before Easter so perhaps not the best day. The park has very few rides other than roller coasters. It does have a section for very small children we did not visit. There was a 90 minute or longer line all day to process season passes (there is a special going on and we bought one because it can be used at their other parks). The lines for coasters varied from 60 -150 minutes. About 4 of the them had ""single rider"" lines which we used to get on in 5 -15 minutes and I'd highly recommend it. With this we went on 9 rides in 9 hours and there were no shows even scheduled. We saw no street performers and one costumed character all day. We've been to 2 other Six Flags parks (Great America and Fiesta Texas) which are superior to this park. This park has absolutely no charm and is even shabby in many aspects. It seems to be sutited to teenagers with season passes who have a day to kill and don't mind hanging out with friends in long lines to go on a few rides. We did enjoy the roller coasters and few other rides we went on or I would have given in 1 star.",sjdmd
20,"Great place to play, but not to eat","I took the family here for vacation. I've dreamed of coming here since I was a kid. I bought season passes for the value, and one gold pass to save on parking. We loved the old and new mix of rides, however, not much to do for my 10 year old. She is too old for the kiddie rides and too young for the big stuff. As far as shows..none! We are seasoned ""parkers"". We visit several a year and have season passes for a few. You have to have some shows, street performers, characters,something more than Bugs and Daffy.. This place is fun, but needs a lot of work.In the morning crowds are low, so go for the big rides. But once people start arriving, the lines get real slow. I've never seen such poor crowd management. The workers take way to long to load rides and don't seem to care. I saw a lot of goofing around and needless conversations that delayed rides. The place could use some paint, some areas are just plain dirty. But the biggest complaint is the food. We spent 38 minutes in line to get hamburgers and a slice of pizza. There were only 2 couples in front of us! Really disorganized food areas and I saw several workers just standing around. The food was cold and bland. We tried several other locations over several days, and same problem. Just getting coffee was hard. After I ordered and was given a cup, a worker cut in front of me an took the last coffee in the carafe. Getting a soda for the kids was a long ordeal as well. You are better off getting drinks from the over-priced vending machine. Next, we tried the sit-down, moose-burger lodge restaurant. We had to wait 15 minutes for a table, which would be fine except once we were seated, we could see most of the tables were empty? Why did we have to wait? Service was very slow, we ordered an appetizer and 5 meals. The meals came first? The portions were small. My daughter got 2 chicken strips and 4 french fries--4! I had the Mooseburger. Not very good it was not Moose-sized though it taste like it was actual Moose. $100 later plus tip, and an hour from start to finish, we had determined never to eat at six flags again. So, fun but dirty park, unmotivated crews,and lousy expensive food. Still, I would go back again but with lowered expectations.",remark757
50,Have a six flags day,"The park was very very cool. There are tons of rides and coasters. The rides were amazing and exciting. Plus, it had a kid zone, so whole family can enjoy here. Give it a try and you'll be joyous. Don't forget trying X2--the best ride EVER!!",Pjr
50,Best Rollercoasters Ever!,"I love this place. I've been going since I was a kid & the rides are always fantastic- except Superman. Last time I went, it was Halloween, and there were zombies that jumped out at you. Fun times!",AnneSansTete
50,"Six flags, excitement plus","Great park if you love rides, little children loved the kids part, heaps to do, printed out tickets online at home before we left, we found 1 day was probably not long enough if there are alot of people in the park as the line up for rides can leave you waiting and not enough time to do other rides.",twelveofus
50,Awesome...even for pansies!,"Six Flags was awesome for everyone in my family. I am a total pansy and expected to be watching the stroller all day but that was not the case. My children range from 5 to 16, and there was a ton for everyone. We wish we could have stayed for 2 days (you need 2 days to do everything). The rides were well maintained and the staff was great. There were even crazy rides for my dare devil 5 year old that is only 46 inches tall. The park is designed well and we WILL be going back!",Cherise N
40,"Rides, thrills, chills, this is it!","Great place for rides...want an experience? go to Disneyland...want rides...come here. If you have any physical challenges, this place is NOT disabled friendly. You are going to be walking up tons of steps and up hilly terrain. It's a work out to say the least. Unfortuanately, the cost of food is outrageous and they will not let you bring in anything...not even snacks. For budget conscious families this was a real challenge. I made my kids split meals and we bought the souvenir cup for $10.00 with afforded free refills. With 9 kids, it was a good deal. Overall, a great family place...need more than a day. Lines are long and not supervised like Disney. So people kinda go every which way, but it all works out.",Kidzoomom
50,Most awesome aerial extravaganza,"This is the premier amusement park if your a roller coaster fanatic as i am. I have been to 6 Flags parks all over the U.S. along with allot of other parks(like Kings Island in Ohio,Carowyns at Charlotte N.C) to name a few but this park is by far the best and if your a power walker like me the terrain offers a great work out",Katherine P
50,Six Flags Magic mountain,"This amusement park is, FOR THE ONES WHO LOVES TALL AND THRILL RIDES, is the best PLACE TO GO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!, we live in Cali and just get a annual pass, didn't do it before because my daughter was little, now she is 13 and loves roller coasters so here we go.This park also has a mini atractions for the little ones too, but if you are a tourist who has the hotel in LA this place is in Valencia, like and hour or little more from LA, so if you had small childrens I will recomend you Knotts Berry Farm who was roller coaster for adult and kids, but if you are a roller coaster fan, this is the place with the highest and craziest rides to enjoy.",Viviana42California
40,Six Flags is ALWAYS a good time!,"The rollercoasters are awesome! You might want to grab a bite to eat before going in and when inside plan on spending $15 for a meal! They do allow ins and outs if you want to leave the park for a meal, but you mine as well pay the extra cash so you can spend more time riding rollercoasters.....or waiting in lines if its a busy day :/ Good value, especially when you get the season pass for the same of an exta few bucks over a day entrance ticket! Good place to go with friends!",Johny H
40,Glad we went back........,"On our other journeys to Los Angeles and Southern California we had never made it to the Six Flags Park.All I can say is I sure am glad we returned with the only real purpose was to be strapped in and sent off for another round of awesome entertainment.........Thanks Six Flags and sorry we took so long to get here!My 2 sons, now 18 and 20 and myself touching the North side of 50 (Actually had a hard time finding many older guys in the line-ups....Crap!) have a real passion for the wooden framed roller coasters. The 2 that are available did not let us down.Presidents Day 2013 could have been a little warm for some vacationing Canadians but oh well maybe next year....Awesome park, awesome day, awesome time with my family.....Thanks Magic Mountain for good times and a clean park.",dcwithwc
20,Advertisements galore,"While the rides were generally fun and the wait times much less than at Knott's or Disneyland, I was disappointed to see advertisements for things like hair gel and snack chips- not only on posted signs, but also on banners within multiple rides, or, even worse, painted onto the very roller coaster cars in one ride. We're already paying upwards of $40 to get in, plus $17 of parking- how much money do they need? That and the constant touting of Discover card, which is apparently perfect if you want to visit Six Flags, but useless everywhere else.It also didn't help that a quarter of the attractions required an additional payment, and that after about 4 hours in the park we had exhausted pretty much everything of interest, were bored, and went home.All in all, not very amusing.",sudobuntu
50,Roller Coaster Lover's Paradise,"If you love roller coasters, you'll love it because that's about all there is to do at Magic Mountain. There are a few other kiddie type rides, but who cares! Some day they'll remove them and put in roller coaster #25! If you have kids (I have seven of them) take them to Disneyland or some other local amusement park that has kiddie rides until they are old enough to really enjoy a real roller coaster park. We purchased our tickets three days in advance and saved $25 a ticket. Parking is $17 whether you pay in advance or not. Local hotels do not have shuttle service from what I observed, but the parking and shuttle situation is adequate. The lines on the big, popular coasters like X2 and Tatsu are around 90 minutes, but most are 30 - 45 minutes. Safety in the park is good. Everyone is there to have a good time so don't pick a fight or try to pick up on somebody else's girlfriend or wife and you'll be fine. As expected, food is very pricey and marginally good. Some coasters are more elaborate than others, but you have to ride them all if you can. Good wheelchair and special needs access with a policy that is fair. Basically, you go up the exit and they tell you to come back in x-number of minutes, which usually matches the number of minutes it would have taken to wait in line. But at least you can ride other rides in the meantime and then come back at or later than your specified time. Then, once you ride, you can use this method again for another ride. We went in early March so the park was not that busy, but the newer, most popular rides are always busy. Have fun. We had a blast!",JoeMahonie
40,A Park that is all about ROLLERCOASTERS,"We went to the park Saturday, March 2, 2013. We had prebought our tickets online for $39.95 each which in our eyes was a bargin. Our local park is much smaller and more expensive. We went directly in, no wait but we didn't arrive until 11:30 am. I have physical limitations so I visited the customer relations and received help with that. The gentleman was very kind.My husband is a rollercoaster addict, he is in treatment for it ;0), so we started with one nearby. I don't do very well on coasters but I was there to be with him. I had fun until I rode one that almost made me black out and then I had to stop, but WOW, my husband was having the time of his life.Lines were a bit long, sometimes 90 min. This was due to the rides only being half run. Often times one side was closed and many times only two cars were being run. I know that this is due to winter, but don't expect to walk right in.I was able to go, schedule a time to return to the ride, which was generally about equal to the time most people would stand in line, and then come back and get right on, but that was because of the disability. It was not a problem. The lines I did stand in however, the times were often generous and I didn't wait as long as the wait sign indicated.Expect to wait in X2 (obviously unavoidable) and Goliath, but most others were about a 15 minute line. Not too bad.Superman was not running.I wish there were more things to do other than coasters. I would have had more fun, but if you are looking for coasters. GO HERE",VacationJunky4445

10,Dirty and not family friendly!!,"Unless you like filthy restrooms, gum on the ride seats, horrible over priced garbage they pass off as a kids burger and cold fries then give you attitude when you ask for hot fries, foul mouthed line cutting youngsters. If have a question about lines, rides, where to eat don't bother to ask. The employees don't seem o know anything. If you get a Ben and Jerry's ice cream and you can find a table that is clean or someone to clean it go play he lottery cause it is your lucky day. If they would hire more helpers way more security and a cleaning crew that works maybe more family's with money to spend will actually return instead of vowing never to waste another sinle time on that place. If the park is so nasty can we trust them the rides and being kept up??? Going through metal detectors before you enter a theme park scaes most family's. Wow they actually need metal detectors! Scary!If you want to have a safe fun family theme park adventure go to universal, knotts, Disney,Seaworld, legoland or the San Diego wild animal park.",1955mickeyfans
50,Best theme park for big coasters!,"This was my second trip to Six Flags Magic Mountain and I had even more fun than the first time. We arrived about 30 minutes after the park opened and got quick and convenient parking right by the parking trolley stop. They picked us up quickly and dropped us off at the entrance. The security line and entrance line were very short (be sure to purchase your tickets online and print at home, otherwise you are paying 20-25 more and having to wait in line to purchase at the park). After getting into the park we headed left towards X2 but the line was already very long, so we back tracked to the entrance and went right instead, starting with Goliath. We went this direction the rest of the day and never waited more than 20 minutes for any rides - X2, Batman, Riddler, Green Lantern, etc. There were so many amazing, fun and exciting rides with short lines and made for a great day! I also found that although the food prices were a little high they weren't as outrageous as other parks I have been to. I also thought the merchandise was very reasonable. I suggest getting a funnel cake with their amazing toppings on your way out of the park! (mud pie, cookies & cream, etc.)",chels0816
40,Fun for the big coasters,"While the park is usually closed on winter weekdays, we went on Presidents Day (in Feb.). Park hours were 10:30-6:00. We got there around 10:00 and waited along with what seemed like lots of other folks to get in the front gates. We immediately picked up our pre-reserved Flash Pass upon entering the park. Not sure if it was really worth the money as many of the lines (especially early in the day) had little to no wait-time anyways. The flash pass did help a couple of times later in the afternoon when we bypassed a good number of people on Tatsu (twice). The flash pass does not work for all of the big rides, only some. We were able to ride all of the rides we wanted to (at least once). We only did the big coasters though...none of the smaller rides. Our longest wait was just over an hour for the Riddler's Revenge because they only had one coaster going at once, often with empty seats. Our favorite rides were X2 and Tatsu, mainly because they were a different concept from any coasters we had been on before. We rode both of them twice. You could not use the basic flash pass on X2. The food was typical park food (overpriced and not real good), so we ate very little while we were there. As for cleanliness, it is certainly not Disney, but it wasn't as bad as I was anticipating based on many of the reviews. Perhaps I would feel differently if I had small children to deal with (like in the bathrooms), or if it had been more crowded that day. We rented a small locker for $12/day near the park entrance where we left my purse and our phones. You can go in and out of those lockers as many times as needed throughout the day. There are also small lockers available near the larger coasters (like inside the waiting lines) but they are one time use and only good for short periods of time (maybe 1.5-2 hours). In all, I had a wonderful day with my two teenage sons...we were on a mission to ride the big rides, we accomplished that and had a great time together.",BooSeattle
50,We loved it!!,"Great time.The down side is the lines get really long by early afternoon.Up side is it has the best rides in california. Try the X2 and Lex Luthor.The food there is not so great even for park food. The BBQ place had good sandwiches but their excuse for chips was more than horrible. Stay away from Jonnyr ocket's burgur, it was dryer than dry.Good value over all",jeb g
10,The owner must be a very cheap person,"In the winter weekdays the park is closed, so only opens on weekends, last Saturday the park was full and every attraction was running with half the staff. I even got stuck at the end of a ride and nobody helped, there was only two underaged staff working that ride and they didn't even notice I was stuck until the next ride. I don't blame them, it was packed wih people. You can imagine how long the waiting period was, 1 hour the least, two hours average, to end up realizing that they could have shortened our waiting period by half If they had the right amount of staff running the rides to full capacity. It wasn't my first time there, certainly my last. What a disrespect for tourists.",Marcelo1077
30,Great Rides Outdated Decore!,"Super Pumped, going to Six Flags Magic Mountain with the family!Going to Magic Mountain in the off-season seemed like a great way to avoid long lines! However, they only run one set of coaster cars per ride to keep you waiting! ON the older rides like Ninja they ran two sets of coaster cars and no waiting Lots of tattered lights adorn the walkways along with pealing paint made for a less than clean looking amusement park. Termite ridden facades as well as cracked cement sidewalks.Seeing the park in this kind of condition took away the magic it had for me as child. I still road every ride and had a blast!",Tony M
50,Awesome time!,Great day spent at the park. Roller coasters are insane! You should spend at least 2 days to take in all the rides. We stayed for an entire day and only completed 7 rides!,712MissLynn712
50,THE BEST AMUSEMENT PARK EVER!!!,"This is by far the best amusement park! The rides are among the tallest, fastest, & longest in the world! The park was clean, the prices were reasonable, the food selection was ample, and the thrills were abundant! The lines were long for some of the rides, but that's expected. I highly recommend this amusement park to any coaster enthusiast or persons 12 years old and over, as the rides all have height requirements.",Scott Smith
40,Not for the feint-hearted,Six lags Magic Mountain in California is simply the most thrilling rides park you can go to in all of the USA. It is quite a distance from LA centre. The are a lot of rides for small children and A LOT OF HUGE RIDES for those who dare to ride them. The park charges a little less than Disney and Universal but you can keep yourself busy for a whole day simply riding the one awesome roller coaster after the other. Food stall sell take-away type foods and park a little dated and you have to pay extra for some rides like go-carts but all in all one of the best places to go for the most thrilling rides. Much more thrilling rides than Disney or Universal.,ruan_13
40,Interesting,Most of the rides were fun and exciting. I loved the Green Lanterns especially. But it's quite far from downtown LA.. about 45 minuted each trip.,Nuni_Nunie
50,Huge Thrills,"This park has way bigger rides then Knott's. X2 was very creative. Superman and the Drop of Doom were terrifying in a good way. Batman was a lot of fun.Green Lantern doesn't look like much but it is intense in a not good way and uncomfortable.Book on-line in advance and the park is very inexpensive, 1/2 the price of Disney. Valencia is in the mountains so can be a bit cooler than Anaheim - almost 0C the day we went.",Wolfpack21
50,"Be early, get the most of it",Great amusement park! Suitable for thrill riders!If u looking for more relaxing but stunningly beautiful go to Disney or Universal which is ~1 hour driving to the south.I recommend to run to the most desired rollercoaster at the morning to avoid long waiting line. The X2 was the desired one and it was less than 5 minute waiting by the time they opened the gate :-)The Best amusement rollercoaster park!!!,TravelOGlazer
50,Like rollercoasters?? Then this is a must!,This is THE place to go for anyone who loves rollercoasters.Be there early and get the fast pass even though a bit pricey especially if you're going in the middle of the summer. The fast pass will get you to pass the line and if there is 1 hours on the normal line this will catapult you through in maybe 10-15 min on each ride.Everything here is fun but my favtorite was Tatsu the flying one that is very scary but you want to ride it over and over again.........The X3 was closed for maintenance when we where there and it was a shame as this one supposed to be the worst of them all. Will have to do it next time!Good advise is to buy tickets online as it will ba around 50% of the price compared to buying at the gates.As all themeparks all food and drinks are expensive inside so be aware if you are on a budget.,FoodVagabond
50,The Ultimate Coaster Park!,"We spent 2 days here over MLK weekend and had a great time. My children (13 & 10) Loved it!. I was worried based on some of the reviews, but I'm not sure what some of the people were expecting. Here are some of my observations and Tips to help someone decide whether this is a destination for them.1. You come here for the coasters,,,,period. If you have young children or people in your party that do not like coasters, then you should look elswhere.2. Wait times. It probably pays to go offseason. We waited 45 min for X2 the first time, and never waited over 20 min again for anything the rest of the 2 days! In fact, some of the older coasters you can literally walk right up to them, 5 min or less!3. Food/Souvenir Prices; I didn't see anything that was priced any differently than what you find in any Amusement Park. Prices are high, but comparable to other locations.This is NOT Disneyland! Why anyone thinks it is, I don't understand. The cost of 4 season passes, 3 nights Hotel, Food, Gas(drove from AZ), souvenirs cost less then 4 2-day passes to Disneyland.Do not worry about having your season pass cards made when you first arrive at the park. The wait was 60-90 minutes long. Go ahead and enter the park, save your printed vouchers and go later in the day. We went 2 hours before park closing time and it took 15mins. You can even do them the next day, you just have to do it before you attempt to enter the park again.",azroyalsfan
30,Not for kids under age 13,"Magic Mountain was a huge disappointment for our family. We took our kids, 12, 10, 7 and 6.Parking was a total nightmare. It was a very long walk all the way to the entrance, and when we waited for a tram, it was full. All this for $17 a day parking fee.As for rides, there are hardly any rides for the 6 year old because she didn't meet the height requirements. They have an area designated for the young rider, but we had to split up our family in order to keep all the kids happy. I wish the rides were more mixed.Retail here is out of control. Food is out of control. It is literally on every corner along with arcade games. There is nothing to look at if you are there for esthetics. It is strictly a RIDE place.Bathrooms and cleanliness are very average. The place does not feel as clean as say, Disney.Here comes the bad part of my review. My 10 year old went on Revolution. She ended up with a concussion. A mild one, but it was not a good experience. I know we take risks going on the rides, but I think this one may need to raise the height requirement, as she could not keep her head back with all the force and she knocked it several times against the restraint bars.On the up side, the EMTs that treated her in the First Aid office were really wonderful. She could barely walk and so they gave us a ride to the car.Overall, I got what I expected here. Expensive and really for an older crowd. I will wait until my kids are much older to spend the $$ to do this again.",Tasiadoo
40,Halloween at Six Flags,"Great new deals with the pictures, just disappointed that we could not get pictures on each rollercoaster.",Willrich F
40,Awesome! Just need more animation!,"Six Flags was awesome, we like it very much, we went in September , early in the morning and there was no crowd, so we went and repeat all the roller coasters! CRAZY the best one is X2!The only thing tht miss in Six Flag is animated characters to be more fun and is more pleasant while doing breaks.",Joana L
40,fun place to go,"my kids love it, they go a few times a year. It's best to go earlier during the day because towards the afternoon and night, it gets more crowded with young adults.",famfavtravels
40,Roller Coaster Heaven!,"As an old Disney Cast member I am very familiar with theme parks. However as my kids age and love the thrill rides more, they prefer Magic Mountain. The roller coasters are CRAZY fun! This park does not have the themeing of Dland but it sure makes up for it in the number of coasters available to ride. You will see older rides that are closed and neglected, but the number of new rides make up for that. We have timed our visits on holidays and cold days and have not had to wait in long lines. Our plan to head to my favorite roller coaster Tatsu first and take the coasters as we come upon them in a counter clockwise fashion has worked for us. We rarely deal with crowds going that direction. But now that I wrote this we will see...Also many complain about the pricing, but this is way more reasonable than a day at Dland. The prices for a park hopper is double a regular priced ticket here. In fact I have not paid for a regular priced ticket here in years! There is always some discount available, especially online. For Christmas they have toy drives where you can trade a toy for admission, they also usually have deals where you get $20 off with a coke can just to name a few deals. The best deal is to buy a season pass, we just got ours for $69 which included parking and hurricane harbor passes!!Yes as other reviewers mention there are tons of teens here but that is because of the coasters! There are also families and people of all walks of life, no different clientele from Dland. The food is expensive yes, but so is most food in a theme park. I usually buy a family meal. I thought the pizza family meal was ample, the burger family meal was ok too. But be prepared to pay over $40 for a family meal that will include drinks for 4.I have gone to the park 2 times over Nov. & Dec. 2012, both times were not crowded. We were able to ride all of the coasters we wanted and some even twice. We ate in the park both times but brought our own water. We did not need to rent a locker, the fast roller coasters have lockers at the beginning of their ques but there also shelves at the loading area for the coasters that you can use for free.Your teens will love this place! I was a little sore though the next day.",A Pampered Traveler
30,"The rides were fun, but that's about it.","We enjoyed the rides at Six Flags Magic Mountain, but the food was terrible. Paid $15 for the worst slice of pizza I've ever had in my life. Also, the washrooms need better attention paid to them, both in repairs and upgrades, and general cleanliness.",kayemzee
50,Magic Mountain,WOW! WOW! This is Rollercoaster Heaven! If you Luv rollercoasters then this is the place for you! Make sure you get their early so you can have time to ride every Rollercoaster Twice!,manny c
30,"Good coasters, SERIOUSLY overpriced!!","All I can say is, COME PREPARED!! First off, they allow NO food in from the outside, how LAME is that?! We brought sandwiches with us which they found during our bag check, and they threw a fit and didn't allow us through the gates with them. REALLY? Yet, INSIDE the park we found a few teenagers smoking weed in a walkway. Sooo.. ya'll allow DRUGS in your theme park but not SANDWICHS?? Sorry.. I am a bit peeved about that because once you are in there, the very smallest locker you can rent is (no joke) $16 and it's TINY. On top of that, a burger costs $12 for what's equivalent to a cheap fast food, thin patty with wilted lettuce. Everything there is designed to drain your pocket book.On the bright side, the rides were fun.. a few were down for maintenance, but the ones we did go on were great.We ended up leaving early because we were starving a refused to pay an arm and a leg and our first-born child for a lousy meal. Plus, we were walking back to our hotel (The Holiday Inn Express across the freeway) and realized they have NO SIDEWALKS up the hill to the park... you are dodging traffic or trudging through wet, soggy grass and mud. Neither choice really safe or appealing.All in all, fun park.. EXPENSIVE though... it's a ""ok, I've been here once, it was amusing for a few hours, but have no intention of returning"" kind of experience.",Elizabeth T
50,Good thrill ride ever!,Have been staying in US and visited this theme park like everyday!My favorite is Deja Vu! Love Goliath but don't feel scared at all.My first ride it was Tatsu and this ride I must say totally awesome!Great Service and nice staffs :')Can't wait to go back and visit there once,RiniRabbit
50,6Flags Magic Mtn - not for faint of heart,"OK, I've read a few reviews before taking my family to 6Flags MM. There were complaints about food prices but I found the prices to be comparable to other theme parks. There were complaints about long lines but this mainly applies to the popular ones. When we chose MM we wanted to ride the extreme coasters and we were not disappointed. Those rides beat me up good, I was a bit sore all over after but man were they ever good. My 9 year old and I managed to hit all the max thrill rides. I hear timing of your visit makes a difference. If you choose a colder day you'll have less competition. MM is not as fancy or clean as Dland and that's expected since gate fees are only $40 and season pass is only $80. The only thing I wish they could improve on are their washrooms.....it was pretty gross. Also not sure if little ones will enjoy as much as Dland but we can't really comment since we do not have little ones anymore. The park is geared for coaster riders so you see more teenagers than kids but we didn't find that to be a problem at all. They're teenagers, not a**holes so I don't see why other people were so worried about them.",Derek C
40,Rides Rides Rides!!,"This park is outstanding!! Tons of coasters and, during the regular season, plenty of shows too. If you go in the off season then be prepared for some coasters to be down and for minimal shows, if any. They still had a few characters roaming about, though, which was quite the treat (if you're a big kid like me). Their BBQ smelled SO good all day, but I'm a sucker for the restaurants right outside the park and was waiting to eat there rather than at Six Flags. The lines weren't too long - maybe a 20 minute wait occasionally, but they were generally pretty fast. Even the rides that had longer waits didn't seem so bad (other than the wind cutting right through me) since there were TVs that played music videos and such.My biggest complaint would be the coaster, ""The Viper""... it banged me up a little bit (my boyfriend too). It's a little bit too rough for a fun coaster and I still have a few bruises on me from it. Basically, if you're at all iffy about riding coasters regularly, then I'd say don't try this one since it will not be very fun.Oh - and Superman was closed down because they are building another coaster in the general area... and that ride isn't supposed to open until later this year, so be prepared for that!",jesboone
50,Thrilling experience at a reasonable price.,"My family of four (36-year olds with 17- and 11-year old sons) visited on Friday, January 4, 2013. The park was not overly busy. Our longest wait was 45 minutes for X2 (which was awesome and well worth the wait), followed by 20 minutes for one other ride and 5 minutes for everything else. We paid $40 per ticket by purchasing online 3 days in advance, which is very reasonable compared to other theme parks. The park was well-maintained and food was decent and pricey just like all theme parks. The best part for us was the low height requirements. My 11-year old always misses out on the best ride because he isn't 54 inches, but this park has so many crazy rides with only a 48 inch height requirement so we were able to enjoy some really exciting rides as a family for a change. X2 was the most exciting ride of all. Green Lantern was also awesome but a little jerky. Apocolypse is the best, smoothest, and fastest wooden roller coaster we've ever been on. Awesome park!",SouthFloridaPam
50,Great customer service very helpful,"Long lines. Expensive lousy fast food. Could use more eaten places. Some of the rides weren't working, like the one I wanted to ride the most the X-2. I didn't come all this way not to be able to ride the biggest attraction.",Teddie T
30,22 yrs later,"Have not been in 22 yrs. Now I have kids old enough and while they do enjoy it as much as I did the biggest complaint was the lines & the quantity of closed/broken down rides. Went on a day that it was pouring in the valley but not at MM. That day was great, 30 minutes longest line, but of course many rides closed/broken down. Went a second day, oh heck no 90 minutes was the average of each line. Hours only 10-8 you will never get on each ride. Park was clean except gum from people without class & people were friends. Food way overpriced. Not sure who justified two quesadillas & a water being $25.. We are talking 1 tortilla.. They may not make money on tickets so they are trying to make up w/food. I told my kids day 2 they can starve until we leave 3 hrs later as I was not going to spend $50 for a family of four to eat quesadillas again! Nobody was even full!!",MomofKS
50,'Coaster Oasis!,"Magic Mountain is truly an extreme rider's paradise! Went over the Christmas holiday week, and the crowds were at a maximum. But the rides are so spectacular that it was actually worth the wait! We started on X2 and it's just an experience beyond anything I've ever had before. The seats rotate on a pre-programmed rate, with the result that you head up the incline on your back, but are then spun around to look straight down as you plunge toward earth. The movement continues throughout the ride. Apocalypse is a new wooden coaster, cruising along at 53 mph, and it seems like 153! Goliath remains spectacular with a huge drop and grand spirals. Loved Scream as well - sitting upright on the loops & spirals. We rode into the night and ended with Tatsu - the most spectacular of them all! After being seated & strapped in, the seats pivot back to leave you facing the ground. We ended up in the front row for our first try, and the experience was both terrifying and extremely exhilarating! Rising several hundred feet into the air with nothing below you is enough of a rush - then plunging, turning and looping in that position was beyond belief! This from a guy who's had a number of decades to become very comfortable with the technology that allows these incredible rides. That one ride makes the admission worth it alone! Hope you have a chance to experience it yourself!",rgmDurham
40,Rides are Wii-rific! Foods are horrific!,"SixFlags parks are definitely a different experience from say, Disneyland. MagicMountain doesn't offer the kind of magic of DisneyParks are legendary for. However, for what they lack they compensate in extreme-trill rides that can satisfy adrenaline-junkies out there. Sadly, I have to say this does not follow with their selection of cuisine. Too much junk foods and no tofu, so to speak. Well, we're not there to eat but to RIDE! Here's a tip: for experience riders, might I suggest SuperMan or Goliath. And for the new thrill-seeker-virgins, Batman The Ride.",Trekie-G
20,"Rides are Good, Service is Poor","I went to Magic Mountain for the first time ever with my son and his friend as we came down for the Rose Bowl. I have to say the rides are much better than anything I have been on in Northern California but the service was lacking.I know this isn't Disneyland, but they could learn a thing or two about being efficient. Many rides went off with empty seats, a couple of the bigger rides Viper and Batman the Ride both only had one coaster running even though there were long lines. The final ride, X2, had a mechanical function that kept us stuck for 10 minutes when the ride had finished. The biggest disappointment was that the DVD we bought for Dive Devil was blank and now I have to go through the hassle of having to send it back for a refund.",tommerj
40,"Good fun, food can be improved.","The coasters were great and we went at a time when you don't have to queue much or at all. I suppose in the busy season the idea of a fast pass is great, but at a price that is almost matching the entry fee of $45, it's way too high and not necessary in the off season.We ate at Johnny Rockets, burgers and fries. This was a let down, it was totally overpriced at $12 each and was bland as hell. Fries had no salt on them and the burger bun was extremely greasy. My burger had the white part of the lettuce on it, no green at all, not very appetizing. So food can be improved greatly.The rides were fun, the staff friendly. The layout of the park is also nice, not too confusing. I wish they had electronic signs like at other parks that display the wait time for all the rides and whether or not a ride is closed. Quite frustrating to walk to a ride only to find out it's closed for maintenance or due to weather.Would visit again!",Tim T
40,Looking for thrill rides? This is it!!,"Los Angeles, I've been to Universal Studio, Disney Park and California Adventure but those places couldn't fulfill my craving for thrill rides.If you're visiting LA and looking for a place to ride the thrill, this is a ""must go"" place. Ticket is cheap compare to Disney park and Universal Studio. But as the cheap ticket, it's kind a different experience here. You won't see much themes or fantasy here except you're here for the rides. If you're boring with the fantasy parade, long line to get a ride, expensive tickets and stuffs, this place gives kinda raw feeling and it's just a theme park rides.Parking is big enough, you may drive further down to D-E zone as they have a shuttle stop there, better than walking.No food from outside allowed, they screen you at the entrance.Toilet is small and not as clean as the Disney park.One important thing is the locker. Unlike Universal Studio or other place where you can get it free. I guess it is $1 per use. That means if you use it and take out your stuffs, there's no refund or reuse for the second time. The distance between each ride is big, so take the stuffs with you if you don't want to pay $1 each time you ride.The waiting time for some rides go from 5-15 mins, somewhat popular rides from 15-30 mins. But be prepared for crowd on the most popular rides such as Superman, APOCALYPSE or Tatsu can be 2 hours of waiting.Overall experience is that the rides are within my expectation, thrill and exciting.I deduct my score due to not so clean toilets and they took my snacks i bought from city.",LivingOneLife
50,"This is Six Flags, not Disneyland...","If you go to Six Flags expecting wonderful decorative atmospheres and top notch service, then you will be disappointed. Six Flags has never hung its hat on those things, which I agree is sad, why not provide your best... They are for EXTREME COASTERS, with I believe 6 of the top 10 in the World any given year, and 2? in Valencia. If you avoid weekends and holidays, the park is great. Weekends and holidays are stupidly busy, which should be expected at any theme park. I recommend packing a nice ice cooler with a family picnic as well. There is a decent little grassy patch in the middle of parking. I'd argue it takes just as long as waiting in some nasty theme park fast food line and is 10x better and nicer. So I give it 5 stars for rides, excitement, yes it is lacking in other aspects, just know what you are getting, there is a reason Six Flags season passes are cheap...",Erik4Travel
50,Great place for teenagers,I went every yera with my friends as a teenager and we never stopped loving it. Usually we were alone and were never afraid of people messing with us.,Carissa R
40,No lines,This was a thrilling park and one that my 11 year old looked forward to more than Disneyland. The rides were exciting and the lines non-existant. Definitely outshined Disneyland.,Tiffany V
10,"Dirty park, totally understaffed, won't be back","We have been 2012 season pass holders but we are done. There's no doubt this park has some of the best coasters in the US, but everything else about our experience was a total disappointment.First, this park is dirty. Every line queue is in need of paint and maintenance (several lines had pipes dripping oil or water onto people), every walkway was littered with trash, and the bathrooms were so disgusting we only found 1 or 2 in the park we could go into without being overwhelmed by the smell, clogged toilets, and trash. Gum is stuck everywhere, dried food is stuck on surfaces, and many of the line queues reeked of overflowing garbage cans.Second - too many broken rides. On the day we went, Superman was down, Goldrusher was down, Lex Luthor was down, X2 was down half the day, Riddler, Tatsu and 2 other rides were on one train. As we spoke with other season pass holders, this is the norm. Whatever you read online or hear from other vistors or are even told at the gate, expect 25-50% of their most popular rides to be closed or on very limited capacity when you go.Last, the park is stupidly overcrowded. Whether due to season passes being made so cheap that too many people come too often, the fact that so many rides are broken down all the time that the remaining ones are overwhelmed, uncontrolled entrances that let 10x the number of people into the park than the rides and spaces can handle, trying to get around this park always means fighting all day long through wall-to-wall crowds. As I said above the coasters are fun, but we spent our entire day moving along jammed walkways through shoulder-to-shoulder crowds, waiting in 2-4 hours lines, all for a 3 min ride. All amusement parks are crowded, I get it, but this was the worst I've ever seen and no effort was being made to do anything to help it.For what it's worth, my opinion is that all of these failures happen because the park is massively understaffed. Rides break down and repair guys don't show up for 30-60 minutes. Safety regs don't allow rides to run with 2 or more trains unless there is enough staff so they just run 1 and let the lines build to 3 or more hours. Bathrooms are not kept clean because there's no one to do it. And so on. As this company continues to go bankrupt, they slash labor to the point where there's no one left to do the critical work to sustain even a basic level of operation. We are a regular middle class family who bought season passes so our kids could go a couple of times a year and ride some rides, but we will never go back to this or any other Six Flags property until these issues are resolved. Stay away.",VegasMike72
40,Kids ages 10 and 13 loved it more than Disneyland....,"Our little dare devil boys, ages 10/13 enjoyed Six Flags more than Disneyland. We opted for the Platinum Flash Pass.... took at bit of time to get used to it as you enter the reserved attractions through the ride EXIT. Once there, you may need to wave for some attendent attention as they may not be aware of your very presence. Being a platinum status, you have the ability to ride twice, however, we felt a bit awkward as most riders dis-embark the ride and you are left sitting there while other riders who are waiting to take your seats are wondering why you're not leaving. I find the flash pass is a good concept and truly one does not need platinum as GOLD is good enough. Bring some antiseptic wipes, bathrooms are atrocious. Have fun.",mjbcmjbc
50,Excellent Day with Great Service,"Rode Ninja, Apocalypse, Riddler's Revenge, Scream, Colossus, Lex Luthor: Drop of Doom, Goliath and Swashbuckler.

30,Good Roller Coasters! Open more cars!!,"We purchased annual passes since we like to come here and hit the coasters whenever we can. Visiting the day after Christmas was a mistake though, and left a bad taste that will stay with us concerning the rides. With a very small crowd, the park had only single cars on most rides. This left us waiting over two hours to ride X2 and several other rides even though the lines were small. Management: why would anyone want to make this a distination when you deliberately make the wait times obnoxious??On a positive note, we ate dinner at the Mooseburger Lodge. This is a comfortable venue in a place that has little sit down eating available. Our server, Tom, went out of his way to make everything about our meal enjoyable.",tmgreen777
40,Six Flags Magic Mountain - Thrill Seekers Paradise,Six Flags Magic Mountain has some of the latest and greatest thrills on the planet. X2 is extremely unique and offeres a ride that can only be found in asia or here in the US. The park is basically clean and offeres new options almost every year. This year they have a payment plan for season passes which makes multiple visits during the year much more convenient!,John P
40,Love the Rides,I went with my sister and it was amazing. The rides are action packed and tons of fun. The only problem I have with the park is the prices of food are terrible. We ended up leaving the park to find something to eat because we thought they were so ridiculous.,bethwc101
50,Off Season Equals Short Lines,"My son and I visited Magic Mountain on Sunday, 09 December 2012. It was a perfect day and there was a drive giving free admission for donating a $20+ toy. We unexpectly found that the park was nearly (relatively) empty. The longest wait was 10 minutes for X2. My sons waited four hours for a similar ride in Six Flags San Antonio. Almost all the rides were literally walk on, with at most a two minute wait. In two and a half hours my son rode the top five thrill rides (I rode one as I am not a thrill rider)! At the end of that time the buffeting had worn him out, so we left about 1:30 PM - three hours after the park opened.The lesson learned is that going off season and perhaps close to Christmas can save you enormous amounts of time waiting in line. Note that parking is $17!",John R

I did purchased the platinum flash pass about 3 months prior was it worth it?

50,Favorite Six Flags,"By far my favorite Six Flags I've been too which includes Six Flags Over Texas (Arlington), Six Flags Great America (Illinois), Six Flags Over Georgia and closed down parks Six Flags New Orleans and Six Flags AstroWorld (Houston). Multiple huge roller coasters that are amazingly fun. Clean facility. Went on a summer day in August and the temperature was GREAT and the lines were not bad at all. Cant wait to go back with friends and family again.",lil_j_3405
40,Great Memories,"So many good times had in this place. I go about once a year. Lots of fun, and the rides never really get old. Everyone has their favorites. Not much to do for the light-hearted folks out there, but great for those who are adventurous.",Evan S
50,Too many rids for one day,Had an amazing day. soo much fun. Not only did the kids enjoy but us adults did too. Some rids are completely frightening whilst others are purely relaxing,Alexander W
50,Muita adrenalina,"For who likes strong emotions, this is the place! It has roller coaster for all kind of emotion. Along the week is usually less crowded, but when this kind of park is totaly empty? Rarely! The infrastructure is good, the park is clean, the staff is nice. I think the food a little expensive, but it's ok. Here's a tip... go with a comfy shoes. I'll be back again sure as hell. I went there in February 2011.",Kabello
30,"Attractions are good, service is not.","I went yesterday with 10 other colleagues and overall we had a great day, the attraction are incredible and the view from some of them is stunning.Nevertheless, they could really do something more for their customers in term of service.Let me tell you a bit more:- we purchased the tickets online and we spent 549 dollars including 2 parking tickets.- at the park we also bought 2 flashpasses adding 618 dollars- moreover we added a booking for X2 (main attraction) which costed another 100 dollars more or less...This is way over 1000 dollars so I consider our group a ""important customer"".Now, in 2 instances I think the service was not good:- we booked X2 for 5.30pm and they told us to be super precise because other people with booking would come in and we are not punctual, we would miss the booking. At 4.15 we start queuing another attraction where the staff put a sign 45 minutes queue (without flashpass). So we enter with the flashpass because even if it was 45 minutes, we would have made it... well, not.. they queue was 50 minutes with the flashpass and we had to run (fast) to be at 5.30 at X2 (we actually arrived 5.40). At that point the staff didnt let us in saying that we missed our booking... there were no other flashpasses customers and we had to go back to the flashpass area to get another booking... the booking they gave us for for 6.30 and we were there since 5.40 and after booking it was 6... the girl there AGAIN didnt let us in because it was ""too early"" this time... After loads of discussion she finally gets us in at 6.20 where basically we ""wasted"" 50 minutes because she was not flexible (BTW, we showed our receipt, so she knew we paid for it)...- The second instance is when we decided to upgrade to a seasonal card at the end of the day. We asked around and they sent us ""outside the park"".Over there, very unhelpful staff told us to go back in without much context... Finally we found the place we needed to go and after paying, they sent us again at the place outside the park...Again, the attraction is VERY worth but the service is not!",Snowmirko
40,For you thrill seekers!,Just spent the day at 6 flags. Had a great time. I took my 16yr old daughter for her birthday. Was a great time but if you are squirmy for big rides that loop you upside down maybe you should consider elsewhere. Small area for little kids but not much . Glad i didnt take my 7yr old kiddie rides were to kiddie and big rides were too big. Not really a place for all ages. We went on a Sunday which is great there was hardly any long lines. I made the mistake of buying the gold member fast pass. Which would have been great if there was lines but there wasn't so I pretty much paid $130 to hang a key chain off my pants. The two rides that had long lines were X2 and Riddler Revenge. And go figure you can't use fast pass on those rides unless you pay additional money. Sales are final on fast pass so make sure lines are long or you just wasted your money like I did. Overall it was a great day. People working there were very friendly and the rides were awesome. Have to say I'm good with not going back for a few years.,Cristina B
50,The most incredible rides in the world!!!,"If you like to get more than 15 thrilling rides on the same place, this is the park you gotta go to. It is packed with some of the greatest rides in the world. The quantity of rides gives you the chance to find a decen line even on crowded days (45 minutes max). Also, each year there is a new ride. This year they gave us Lex Luthor Fall of Doom as the newest ride, but the classics are as good as ever: Viper, Goliath, Scream, Batman the Ride, Riddlers Revenge are incredible. If you want to spill your stomach out, try X2 and Tatsu, they are radical!!!",Jorge Jair M
50,rollercoasters everywhere!!!!!,"its an awesome day for the thrill seeker, x2 was the best coaster!!! get there early n grab the jump the queue pager..worth the extra money to save lining up. so get out there n get on the coolest rides ever!!! ps dont eat too much before hand :)",Benjamin B
50,Six Flags Valencia,I love to coming to this place sometimes its only open on the weekends we used to take the kds and play hooky and come up here when it was slow but now you can only come on the weekends and it sucks because you can beat the lines but if its hot you skip the ride park and do hurrican harbor its just as much if not more. there is this ride called x 2 intense and extremly fun plus all the old school favs in the water park i suggest a tight top with a lot of support because the little boys wait at the bootom of the huge black slide due to the fact that no matter what your top is flying up the incine is intense and the boobs dont stay at 4 pm it cold bring a sweater and a lunch you can eat in the parking lot with a stamp,Destiny J
50,Best roller coaster ever...,"Best place to go if really enjoy radical stuff! Best amusement park ever!Our day wasn.t the best to go... Was to full...Anyway, is where I would like to come back and ride in every one... Special the X2!!!",marininhabs
50,Two words: Roller Coasters!,"Southern California has many amusement parks, and this park fits a specific niche in that setup: thrill rides, and lots of them. If you want clean and perfect and rides that are well-themed, go to Disneyland or Knotts. If you want to ride fast, crazy, and sometimes unique roller coasters and don't much care if the park looks a little rough around the edges, then come here. My daughter and I come regularly (we have season passes) and always have a blast.One thing I must say: you absolutely cannot miss a ride on X2 when visiting the park. It is a completely unique roller coaster (with the only other one like it located in Japan) that that first drop WILL get your adrenaline going. The only problem is the low riders-per-hour, so even relatively short lines can move very slowly.",mmotley
50,calling all thrill seekers,great for teenagers but some rides rough beware of scary ones like x2 and viper and make sure to go early to avoid the crowds,Daniel L
50,Loved Six Flags!,Loved this theme park! The rides are scary and worth the trip! It is hard to get to though so we had to get a Starline tour bus so we had to leave an hour before the park closed which was disappointing. Loved the theme park however we had to wait a while for most of the rides and it was very unorganised with their staff. Some of the rides stopped operating while we were in line and none of the staff members below even knew it had stopped! We didnt know weather to keep waiting or come back later which wasted alot of time. Once we finally got to go on the rides though it was worth it!,Pinkstarz77
50,Total blast,If you like rollercoasters this is the place to go. There are a wide assortment of coasters. Sopme of the best we have ever been on. We did the platinum Fast Pass and never waited for more that 10 minutes to get on a ride. The Fright Fest was a great time. The mazes were great fun with lots of screaming. I think this park is more for teenagers/adults. They did have a smaller amusement area for little children but I woudol not go here with children. Height restrictions on all the good rides. Clean park. Food is expensive and poor quality but we came here for the coasters not to dine. I would like to try the water park but it was closed when we were there.,JaneLacey
40,great coasters,"If you like speed, this is the best place for coasters. we love the 1st row of goliath. the food here is snack-bar like, but.. you go here for the coasters",hugh b

30,"Fun, buuuut....","Though the park was fun for Fright Night...The lines were sooooo long and the wait was up to 2.5 hours per ride. The cost is expensive and though some of the rides are fun, the wait is FAR too long. Goliath scared the CRUD out of me...:)All in all...I would have rather spent the day swimming in the ocean for free! I probably won't return...they should have a cap on how many riders they allow in the park. Maybe offer bracelets to those who are riding and a different bracelet for patrons who are not riding rides.....FAST PASSES SUCKED! There has to be a better way! Be original....",misledandliberated
50,Magic Mountain Fright Fest Steps Up Their Game,"It is a tradition to attend the Fright Fest for my daughter's birthday every year and this year was was especially awesome. We do go early in the month to avoid the even bigger crowds. My only gripe is the long lines for X2 and Tatsu. They are truly the leader for amazing coasters and a 2 thumbs up for Drop of Doom! The staff running the Drop of Doom ride seemed very efficient and well trained. They kept the line moving. Also, Fright Fest was awesome. Thank you Six Flags for adding a couple more mazes. Loved Black Out!! The Willoughby's Mansion maze was ruined by a group of snotty kids that we happened to be grouped with. Other than that, the scare zones and mazes were better than last year.",BigBearMicky
40,Teens love it,We went to Magic Mountain with my 14 and 16 year olds. They love it! I also enjoyed the rides. The lines are sometimes long but you make the most of it. The downsize is there isn't much for gift shops or places to eat.,taylorta2010
40,great value for the price,we bought an annual membership figuring that it pays for itself in just a few days. We had a blast - rode every ride twice and more. We'll be back in the spring and summer. can't wait to check out the water park!,Dondi C
40,Awesome coasters!,"We recently went to this six flags park and having not been to one before, we were reasonably pleased. Some of the queues were quite long but having been to Alton towers in the Uk a number of times we were kind of expecting some queuing and the longest one was probably an hour and a half so still less than Alton towers. Also this queue was for X2 which is probably the best coaster there so understanderble. By the way, I'm a big fan of coasters and six flags did not let me down. X2 is hands down the scariest coaster I have ever been on, it's absolutely crazy! But I loved it! The park itself is fairly big and quite spread out which is good. We stayed for the fright fest and I also thought this was very fun. I have been to the universal studios Halloween special in Florida though and I didn't think it was as good as that but I still thought it was pretty good and we both had a good time! We went to the willoughby's fright fest meal which was also good, the characters were really convincing! Would definitely go again!",Tuckenby
20,"Frightfest was fun, but the park and services in general....","This park was super crowded, which already makes it impossible to ride the way you want to. I was, however, completely dissatisfied with the bathrooms. I couldn't believe how nasty they were. Very, very poor upkeep and I believe that was totally uncalled for. This same year, I went to Six Flags Great America in Gurnee, Il, and the bathrooms are newly remodeled and the upkeep, I never experienced what I had at Magic Mountain. Horrible. May be understaffed and underpaid. Also, for the amount of money they make from these parks, they can atleast renovate the bathrooms. Also, they should add more in the park. We always had to go to general areas to go the the bath. They were all NASTY!I did like the themes for Frightfest though, but it was so crowded that we were unable to visit them all. It was crazy how long those lines were, but there was something everywhere you go. Like being in a haunted park. That's what helped.",stokeslp3
50,Roller Coasters galore!,Six Flags Magic Mountain is the perfect amusement park for those seeking an insane coaster experience. I believe currently there are over 18 coasters and more to come! The park is incredibly clean and never felt overly-crowded! We went during Fright Fest and they did a fabulous job decorating the park and having zombies walk among the crowds! I highly recommend purchasing one of the fast passes for the rides- there are very prices and levels but it is WELL worth it as most of the lines can be almost a 2 hour wait!,Cindy H
50,"Love Six Flags, best one EVER!!!","I recently went back to Six Flags Magic Mountain over the Halloween weekend to experience what they call 'Fright Fest'. For those of you who haven't been to Six Flags, they take the saying 'go big or go home' seriously. Visit the website (link below) to see what kinds of attractions there are for the whole family. I went with a group of friends, and we are all thrill seekers. So naturally, this park has some of THE BIGGEST and BADDEST roller coasters in North America.Do your research before planning a trip. This park is HUGE, and would take all day just to walk around, depending who you go with. Be prepared to pay for approx 45-50$ gate admission to get into the park, and $17 parking. If you are a tourist and want to get the most bang for your buck, I highly recommend purchasing 'The Flash Pass'. The pass is an electronic piece you carry with you around the park. You can purchase it for groups of people and it virtually books your spot in the 'flash pass' lineup, and vibrates when your ride time is ready! Flash Pass holders by-pass the regular lineups and have their own back entrance straight to the front of the lineups. This allowed us to ride all of the rides we wanted to multiple times within the same day.The rides here are like none other; Tatsu is the flying rollercoaster and is ridiculously intense holding several world records for the fastest and tallest flying coaster. Same deal with other rides; check the website and explore the other rides! Six Flags has an abundance of staff ready to assist anyone, and ensures smooth operations getting people on and off rides as quickly as possible. Be warned though, on busy days a lineup for a popular ride can be a long as two to three hours!!!. Get the FlashPass to avoid wasting your day in a lineup!The food is somewhat overpriced, but is rather decent. You can get beers at the Moose Lodge, and all sorts of fair foods across the park. This place has so many things to see and do, you'll have to plan for a full 12 hour day. This was my second time back to Six Flags Magic Mountain. I have been to a few other parks, and this one is by far the best!!! Both in assortment of rides, and the unique location.",AlbertaEdmontonGuy
50,Breathtaking FUN !!!,Six Flags Magic Mountian one of the Great THRILL RIDE Parks ! Great location from Fresno you can get there in about 2 1/2 Hours . Admission Price is Great I upgraded from a single day pass to a season pass good for the rest of 2012 and all of 2013 plus free parking and Huracane Harbour admission for 2013 No Blackout Days and you can use the pass at any Six Flags Park the total price was 65.00 dollars compared to Disneyland one day pass at 102.00 and season passes starting at 300.00 up to 650.00 . THANK'S Six Flags can't wait till next spring for the new Coaster it's going to be the Tallest and Fastest Looping Coaster !!! TWO ,Jetson10
40,"A fantastic park with a good ticket price, but be aware of the add-ons","Hands-down, these are some of the best rides thrill-seekers can find. If you are a lover of rollercoasters, Magic Mountain is a haven. That said, use your head and be aware of when to go, what to bring and what to expect:- The ticket price is money well spent, good value for what you are getting. Check the website in advance, if you know what day you'll be going it saves you substantially to book your tickets ahead of time. Also, pre-book your parking pass which will save you about $5.00 or so.- Try to only bring things that will fit in your pockets, and wear something with very secure pockets. Most rides will flip you around and have nowhere onboard for you to keep purses, bags, etc. Sometimes you have to take your shoes off if you are wearing flip-flops and such, or hats. A few rides have lockers for a dollar per use, and there are day lockers starting at $12.00 for the day. Quite pricey for a simple locker, next time I'll have zip pockets that can hold all of my money and plastic.- Pack your own food and bring water bottles! Food and bevies are quite overpriced, especially for what you get, with the sole exception of Cold Stone icecream which isn't too bad price-wise. There are water fountains here and there, and you can leave non valuable items like waterbottles on the sides of the rides while you go for your turn.- The Fright Fest is a fantastic event, the mazes are fun, the actors around the park are genuinely freaky, and it's intense being able to ride already-terrifying rollercoasters in the dark and/or backwards too! Especially at a time of year when they are only open for the weekends. - Going for the most popular rides before or after the big rush of people between about 11:00 and 5:00 makes a huge difference in how long you will wait in line. Except during that peak period for really popular rides like X2, we didn't wait longer than 25 minutes for any particular ride, and often that was because when we saw we'd only be in line for all of 5 to 10 minutes we opted to wait longer for the front car, which was well worth a few more minutes. We did not buy the express pass as we went during a less busy weekend of a lower period, but if you are going during a peak time of year I would imagine it's a good idea to get one, especially if you've only got a day and do not live in the area.- The park is large and well spread out with lots of trees and places to rest, so you can always find somewhere shady to rest in between rides without feeling crowded.",Deanna H
50,Great place to visit,"Magic mountain is a great place to visit for all there roller coasters. Often over looked is the kids area with great rides for the kids. through out the park there is also many family friendly rides. Be sure to check out the gift shops as they always have stuff on clearance.I would also recommend not to go on X2 until the end, or your last ride of the day. This ride has the longest ride wait time and it seems many people go straight to it when entering to park. Riding X2 is like nothing I've ever experienced! I nick named this ride the BEAST!",Richardvwman
20,Worst amusement park experience ever!,"I visited Six Flags Magic Mountain with a friend on October 27th 2012.Our expectations were sky high, but the disappointment were just as extreme as the rides. We started with the X2 rollercoaster - 3 hours of waiting!!! Their rides are great, but NO rollercoaster is worth 3 hours of waiting in line!! After two rides we called it a days and went home.The park in general is alright, but the fact that the park is closed on weekdays ruins it.It seems like they are all about the business and money, and don't care about the visitors.I cannot recommend this park to anyone, but if you absolutely have to go, go on a rainy day!",Mark C
40,Always fun,"Aside from the long lines and the amount of time it takes to get through the metal detectors, it's always a good time. I never remember to bring sunblock!",wayward_tripper
50,Always Fun!,"We have been many times and are never disappointed. Love the flash pass option, we live out of State and it was nice to be able to get on all the rides for $$ but worth it since we only had the one day.",GemJess
50,Great Day!,"Our family had a blast visiting Six Flags for a day. Being off-season, the crowds were relatively light, which was great, but it also meant that many of the rides were running at minimal capacity. So while most rides were very short waits, we hit a couple that took 45 minutes to an hour. We had some concern going in about our ability to stick together, especially because my daughter's only barely 48"" tall, but it turns out that quite a few of the rides, even some of the ""maximum thrill"" variety, were just fine (and the park map/info called these out quite well so that we didn't get too far into disappointment situations).If you're planning on going, make sure you check around for various discount programs. If nothing else, check the website for online ticket purchases. Buying the tickets online saved us $80 off the ""buy at the park"" price. We also paid for parking and bought a family meal (pizza, salad, & drinks) online, though the savings in those cases were zero (for parking) and very small (basically a free salad for the meal); but it was certainly much easier to manage it as a single purchase.We look forward to returning again some day to catch some of the rides that we missed and maybe even a few new ones!",Matt H
40,Good Time!!,"We went to Six Flags as part of ou Disney trip and I would say that 6 flags was better than Disney.The park is only open on the weekends in October and with Halloween coming it was a little busy, but much shorter lines than Disney.They have awesome rides for bigger kids/adults and a pretty good area for smaller kids.Unlike Disney, your entry gets you into the Halloween activties, which are pretty cool. They have some great shows and lots of people dressed up in creepy costumes.",Sask_Rider_Fan_001
10,Never Again,"My review basically agrees with Tim T of Canada. What a dump of a park! The rides yes are very good however while we were there The Green Lantern broke down and was down all day, tatsui broke down while we were on it and Revolution broke down. The rides look poorly maintained and quite a few feel it as well. The staff are beyond incompetent, the food rubbish, even more so than expected at theme parks.The park layout and signage is appalling. The restrooms are beyond disgusting. I was last here 16 years ago and it doesnt look like they have been cleaned since. This is what you would expect in the dingiest bar in the worst suburb in LA not a theme park. that also includes some of the patrons especially by about 6pm. We watched the crowd dynamic change and got our family out of there.We got the Platinum Flash pass. The single biggest waste of money I have ever experienced. The rides you want it for like Superman and X2 aren't included. Most of the rides included you dont need it as they are the old ones. It doesnt get you to front of line anyway you still wait. The ride twice system is stupid. It stuffs people in line around who are trying to get on the ride together. You feel bad that the next people in walk up to the ride waiting for you to get out until an attendant finally comes along and pushes them back into line.Seriously Six Flags this park is a disgrace and the problem starts at the top. Universal and Disney kill this dump.",Redaussie8
10,Best Rides but Worst theme park,"What can I say more about the title? The rides are this theme park are amazing. Super fun, gives you thrills you expect but everything else about the park leaves much to be desired.The layout of the park is pretty poor, lots of legwork is needed to get around.Maintenance of the park, well, there is none it seems. The rides, have rust on the metal. Gives you a super safe feeling when you go up on a ride. The restrooms, I don't think I've ever been in a more disgusting washroom in a attraction that you had to pay to get in. The restrooms are terrible, just completely disgusting. DO NOT change your baby's diapers in there. The walls have paint chipping. Rails are broken.What scared our group when we visited, was that there was passengers stuck on the Riddler, the maintenance staff came by, which seemed like 18 year old. He had a hammer in one hand, and a screwdriver on the other. it was like watching child play with blocks, hammer this, twist here, twister there. It was ridiculous. The fact, he didn't test it before allowing another passenger get on, shocked us. It was not until we spoke out about it, that other staff closed down the seat from other passengers to sit in it.It was a pretty hot day when we visited in September, the park decided not to turn on AC or turn on the mists. Why? beats me. Everyone in the park was melting. Cheap.Our tourists to the area, also pointed this out, which we had not noticed before. Guard Towers with actual guards in the parking lot.. Really? wow... Fear for your safety begins now. The park also features a full Sheriffs office...You know its a quality park, if the tram that takes you from the parking lot to the theme park, is from the early 80's and is the same tram from Universal studios, without guard rails and what not. sit in the middle.. sit in the middle.The patrons of this amusement park seem a bit suspect. You got your fair share of regular folk but you also have elements of the dark side. Gang members. Full out gang members. While waiting in line, we did a quick google search and it revealed alot about this park. I would advise you do the same and think twice about bringing your children with you.This park is also very disorganized when it comes to lining up for rides, there just don't have the staff to accommodate the crowds. The lack of professionalism of the staff was clearly evident, but what can you expect, this isn't Disneyland or Universal, you do pay 2/3 of the cost of Universal and half the price of Disneyland.The one saving grace of this park was the extreme thrills the rides provided. Definitely a saving grace to this attraction.",Tim T
50,THE BEST THRILLS IN L.A.,"Six Flags magic Mountain does not have the polish you will find at Disneyland true... but if you love rides and thrill seeking fun, look no further! Magic Mountain offers the best roller coasters in Southern California. You will flip, dive, fly, and zoom around. It's a blast and there are also games to enjoy as well as a kiddie area, some water rides, and shows. Take sunscreen, comfortable shoes, and enjoy! Plenty of food and shopping too.",TeemareeDotCom
40,six flags,"Loved the rides, although we got stuck on one ride... but the HILLS to get to the rides are terrible to climb!The park is ""old"" looking and needs a facelift!",Azroze63
50,Extreme thrills,"We booked a day tour and when we got to the park decided to upgrade to the gold flash pass. This was the best thing we could have done as we had no wait time for any of the rides and could stay on any ride for 2 rides in a row. There were a lot of people around but having this upgraded pass was just wonderful. Also strongly recommend the drink upgrade which for only $30 for 3 drink bottles, enabled us to get free drink refills for the entire day. It was an extremely hot day, so this was great.Park was clean and tidy and when we had to ask for directions, the staff were more than welcome to help. Didn't manage to get to every single ride :( as we had a bus to catch back to Anaheim. Will definitely visit next time we are in LA.",Tania R
40,Go for the thrills,There are only two reasons to go to Magic Mountain. 1. The thrill of the gut-wrenching rides. 2. To chaperone adolescents who are determined to wrench said guts. I would fall into the latter category. I can say the children screamed and laughed and told many brave stories. And that the park was clean and well-maintained and vigilant with safety regulations. Good enough for me.,GraniteRN
10,Security & assistance,"One of our students became lost, and when the park staff was asked to help, all they cared about was we were to close to the fence, of the entrance, although we had paid admission. When asked for someone in a higher capacity, they kept sending out more incompetent workers. All they care about is money.",Opie T
40,Crowded and long waits made for a long day.,"Great rides, poorly executed crowd management, it was fright fest and extremely busy. That being said October seems off peak to me, staff was friendly and helpful. Lines are expected but a 2 hour wait is a bit long. We rode 8 rides, a maze, a sit-down lunch and shopping in 13 hours overall a great day in a fun park. It is bit tired and rundown. They extended hours to 12:30 am while there which helped relieve some of the urgency.",Btj1972

50,One of the best roller coaster parks in the US,"My wife and I love roller coasters and this park truely impressed us. Tastsu and X2 standouts. Both of these rides will make all other roller coaster's you've been on seem like a merry-go-round. We went on a October Friday when the park opened and didn't wait in line for more than 10 minutes. There are other rides here (Goliath, Viper, Green Lantern, and the Riddler's Revenge) were also great! Highly recommend this place to any roller coaster enthusiast. We'd also recommend that you try to go during off-peak times.",Jeff_and_Lisa_12
50,Coaster Heaven,If your looking for a thrill this is a great place to take the Family. Love X2 and Tatsu. Make sure you ride X2 when you first get there otherwise you'll wait longer. My family loves this park. Can't beat the price for a annual pass.,banik001
40,Awesome but too hot in August!,"Being used to British rollercoasters, I couldn't help but being impressed by the height and size of the coasters at Six Flags. They rides also lasted longer than they do at home.We went on the first day of school term, so it was lovely and empty and walked onto most rides without queuing- bliss!! As we didn't realise how empty it would be, we got there long before the gates opened and like other early birds, were subjected to 'entertainment' - that was a young lad and girl with microphones and bad music being excitable and talking at the crowd. I was glad when the gates opened just to get away from them.The first ride was X2 which I nigh on crapped myself. Most of the rides were brill. The Green Lantern made us feel quite nauseous, but still, we were glad we experienced it. The only ride I HATED was Goliath - with only a simple cross bar on my thighs, I didn't feel held in enough and convinced myself I would fall out. Then due to spinning and extreme heat, my head was swimming at the bottom.Being August, it was roasting hot all day, well over 100 degrees, so I had to drink a lot of water and it was tough walking about - so glad I didn't have to queue. There were great views of the scorched California landscape from many of the rides when I dared open my eyes!",bud32
30,Good but pricey,"Spent Saturday 29th there.Upgraded to Platinum pass as this was the only day we had while visiting the USA. Expensive and probably not worth it , the Disney fast pass is a better system.Good points , we got to ride all the extreme rides , sometimes twice in a row , and they are the best coasters I have ever been on.Bad Points , X2 , I paid an extra $45 for 3 of us and it had a 2 hour wait... Then when we got there it had broken down!If you want the best coasters anywhere , go here. But be prepared to pay for the experience.",David P
40,Rollercoasterheaven!!,"Well, if you like rollercoasters this is a must.We happened to be around for the last day of the season, and that turned out to be a great day to go here (Not that many visitors)However they weren't runnig on full capacity this day, so to some of the rides there were still quite long lines (1hour+), but to most of them we could just walk right in and get a seat right away.Having read some other reviews i can agree on the restroomissues : They need more/bigger restrooms.I can highly recommend going on a ride in X2, it was the best thing ever!!Book your tickets atleast 3 days in advance on the website and get a nice discount.",Niklas P
50,Magic Mountain Season Holder,Love it here. We always purchase a season pass and love going. The candy apples are 2 for 5 dollars and are really tasty. We love the new rides and miss Deja Vu. Look forward to coming here until I am old like Mr. Six.,Esther Cruz Sosa
50,Brilliant Fun,"Great theme park which even my wife, who is not the biggest roller coaster fan, really enjoyed. We invested in the gold flash pass as we were only there for the day and the park was only open for 8 hours. This really saved us some time in not having to queue for long periods - except on the 3 most popular rides. Only criticiscms are that the best ride - X2 - comes with a further charge and that not all of the rides are open / accept flash pass which is disappointing given the expense",damihe1
50,Take a wild ride!,"This place was amazing and so much fun! There were no rides closed for construction so we managed to conquer all but two as we ran out of time! Apparently each six flags has a unique feature that supposedly makes them the best, magic mountain has the most vertical drop on a rollercoaster! We got on it and boy did it drop the thrilling part of this drop was the tunnel at the bottom made it feel like you were going to get you're head cut off haha! The X2 was the first ride we went on not knowing what to expect I've never screamed so much on a ride in all my life it was definitely worth waiting in line for! Maybe the fast pass is an idea to upgrade your ticket if we had of done this it might have given us an extra hour to get those two rides we missed! If you're someone like me and gets motion sickness take two tablets half hour before your first ride and you won't miss out on any of the fun! It's a pretty cheap entry if you have your own car we took a tour bus which meant we spent a bit extra but it was definitely worth it! Only about an extra 10-15mins away from Universal Studios.",amylee91
10,"Disabled cancer-survivor discriminated against, humiliated, and ejected from parking lot!","I'm a disabled cancer survivor and was disgusted by the treatment my friends and I experienced yesterday at six flags magic mountain. We were unlawfully detained, searched and questioned by Six Flags security after they received a ""tip"" from the parking fee attendant that our vehicle smelled of marijuana.Before we had the chance to even collect our things and head toward the parking shuttle, a security officer tapped on the driver's window and asked everyone to exit the vehicle. I asked why and he simply said ""everyone needs to step away from the vehicle"". Two more officers approached and began to do a visual search of our vehicle, they requested id from everyone and questioned us about when we had last smoked. We told them the truth, that we had smoked long before entering the park. They told us that even though we all have valid medical cannabis recommendations, we were being ejected from the park. They claimed that we were intoxicated and it was unsafe to ride roller coasters in such a state. We were also told that we would not be issued any type of refund for our tickets or parking which they refused to believe expired that day. They insisted that our tickets were good until the end of the year and would not allow us to show the printed ticket which clearly stated otherwise.I've been a patient and advocate of medical cannabis for the past 6 years and have never experienced such blatant disregard for the STATE LAW that protects my right to medicate with a safe, natural, and legal product. No where in six flags's park regulations does it state that you may not enter the park under the influence of anything nor does it prohibit use or possession of drugs be they legal or illegal.I've lost any respect I ever had for Six Flags. I've been coming to this park for over 20 years but unfortunately, until they decide to respect laws that California voters approve, I along with millions of other patients who rely on cannabis to relieve chronic pain and replace mind-numbing anti-depressants will be left out of the fun.",Audrey S
30,A nice get away but not great.,"Not having to drive through Downtown LA if you are coming from the north (which is most of the state{area wise}) to get to the park is nice. But the park is primarily roller coasters. It also attracts primarily crowds of teenagers. Not liking roller coasters, or crowds; this was not my favorite place. I prefer Knotts, or if I want to deal with huge crowds Disneyland.",socaltrekkie
50,Great day but... expensive!,"There is no doubt that was one of the greatest day ever! but.. it is an expensive attraction.We bought our tickets with a triple A discount for 33$, that's seem like a fair price. but, the parking cost 17$, you can't bring any food or drinks inside tha park, the food are 10$ and above, a bbottle of water is 4.50$ (I recommend you to buy the refill cup, it is much more worthwhile) and every picture costs over than 16$.Don't miss the tatsu roller coaster, it's amayzing!!!",Revital G
50,MUST GO!,"Going to SIx Flags was an amazing experience! If you're fun and daring, you must go there.... It's a great place to spend a whole day.... If you're in California for a couple of days, take a day off and just chill and enjoy at Six Flags...Try to go to all the rides and remember, the longer the waiting line is, the awesome-er the ride is!To save time, it's better to get a flash pass, inorder to avoid the long hectic waiting line...Also, just check the requirements before going, because you dont want to get stopped for a ride if you're underweight or too short or whatever...Anyways, Six Flags was a great experience and Have Fun! :D",Meredith G
50,Always a good choice for a outing whether it is family or some friends.,"Just finished our 3rd time at Magic Mountain and have had more fun than I can remember in a long time. Big park and so much to do. A common misconception is its all big rides but there is a tremendous amount to do for all ages. It is a very good destination place for everyone. Most of the hotels around the park are fantastic. The rides themselves are fun and some will blow your mind. Just so everyone knows I have done a bunch of different ones including ceded point, dollywood, the old elitsch gardens and a few others and this remains one of my favorites. Season pass is a great deal or even a single day for only $35 online. The only downsides would be the lack of ac units while you are waiting for rides (indoor areas) and the amount of uphill walkways to get to rides may make for a tiring say. Overell great fun for anyone and everyone.",brent0702
50,Awesome!!!,"Rides were funtastic and thrilling, very short lines!!! Resturants and bathrooms were clean and easily accessable!",KristiH3
20,"Yes, excellent for thrill rides...BUT!","Unlike a number of the reviews I see here from Santa Clarita Valley locals, I continue to find this ""destination"" dismal, unclean in many spots, and completely overwhelming with gang-types and similar. There is supposedly a dress code that is enforced upon entrance, but apparently visitors are bringing a change of clothing, and park security is not / or will not enforce once inside the park. Again, this is overwhelming within Magic Mountain, at least during the evening hours. (The same does not apply at the attached Hurricane Harbor Waterpark) Some suggestions, you can save money by parking at any number of spots along the Santa Clarita Valley Bus Line route to Magic Mountain. The bus stops inside the park and is a 5-7 minute walk to the gate. The difference between the $1.00 bus ride and $10.00 parking makes sense, depending on how many people you have in the car. If you're determined to park inside the park, look around a bit, as attendants may try to make you park in the ""boonies"" and you may have a 10minute or more walk to your car. Also, check the rules on bringing water and beverages into the park, as prices are high (obviously). Food choices are not like at Disneyland, and I believe you will go looking for local food once outside the park.",scv91355
40,Excellent for thrill rides,"However excellent the rides are, the organisation and facilities for keeping thrill-seekers cool and hydrated in high temperatures whilst queuing are sadly lacking. The employees are polite and courteous but, on the whole, are young and appeared not to enforce the parks own rules (ie queue jumping, profanities, young men going shirtless etc). The wait times for the rides bore little resemblance to the actual queue time. The sign posting around the park is poor leading to walking to rides only to find a 2 hour wait time for a ride and then having to walk back again. The gate security is laughable, with no body checks for alarmed gates on people and the bag searches may as well not happen - it seems as if they were checking for food & drink items only and not for anything else. But on the plus side - the rides are awesome - the Lex ride is definitely the best and ones to avoid are the first ever looping rollercoaster.",Kemper_Forbes
30,I'm a local..what you should know as a visitor.,"I've been bringing my family here for years. I have 3 kids and I can tell you that I think this is the best park for 'little"" kids in southern california if you are in the area. My suggestion...get a yearly pass if you are local. Only go during the week and in the morning. The little ones will love it and you can divide and conquer with another parent if you have kids a little older.Now that my kids are teens, here is the advice i would pass along. Avoid going at night and particularly at night on weekends. Never drop your kids at night. There is an element here that is a little scary. If it's during the day...no problem to leave them and you can pull in and drop them at a circle. and pick them up with out paying to park.ATMOSPHERE? The place is what you would expect for an amusement park and the rides are fantastic but the entire park is DIRTY. The rides, bathrooms..everything. they have done nothing in years to improve the cleanliness of this park and it makes me mad every time I'm there. The food is very expensive and even on a slow day they close restaurants and work on a skeleton crew so the lines are very long. While this place is a lot of fun for teenagers. As a parent this can be frustrating.",yellowsunfish61
40,Awesome rides,"Six Flags! Love it! I went mostly recently on a Sunday in May and the lines were suprisingly quick. The rides are thrilling, parking and tickets are reasonably priced. The park has hills, so wear comfortable walking shoes. My only complaint is that they dont allow even small purses on rides, so you have to leave your belongings to the side (unsecured!) or rent a locker.",kaykat4533
30,Scares me everytime!,I can't even remember how many times I came here when I was younger. Fun place to hang out with family and friends. But I get scared every single time and cursing at myself for keep coming back.,Hanley L
50,AWESOME,"This park is awesome. This was my second time in the park. I recommend to go after summer season is over and on weekday if possible. Go to the park right before they open and head to the ride, which you wanna ride for sure, there will be no line. The best rides, have long lines later, so just skip them, better ride 7 average ones than 1 good one. Water rides were great too, relaxing and fun. Good food is hard to find, but oh well. For sure, buy a refill souvenir bottle, it pays off. ;) have fun. Oh and one more thing, buying ticket online in far advance saved us $25 bucks a person.",MiRkA_j85
40,"awesome rides, but we got lost in the park several times...","This park is excellent for the ones looking for extreme rides! check out their website before visiting the park, to see the rides and also the park hours/schedule.What we loved: excelent extreme rides, several places to rest/seat, beautiful facilities.What could be improved:- have more attractions to the ones affraid of extreme rides - the moderate rides were actually quite strong, and the mild ones sometimes were very dummy.- the signs to indicate where each attraction is, actually have more signs because we got lost several times during our visit.- the park map is not helpful at all.- beers are sold only in one restaurant that you have to be seated in order to have it; and in a place called ""Food & etc."". More places selling beer would be nice!- the ""Flash Pass"" (a special pass to cut the lines) is sold only at the park entrance, could be available to be purchased in other spots along the park.",pmariye
20,Poor mans Disney :(,"Hoping this isnt too much of a rant!!:) ....Well, maybe it's our fault for going on a Saturday, but the only other choices where to go on a Sat, Sun or Monday. The sun was belting down at 37c & as we got there, the queues where very long, but we figured the queuing systems in these parks are quite good....Wrong! We got our passes online (trying to be organised). We ended up waiting in the hot sun(No shade provided) for 55mins!!, people where literally sweating, I saw one girl faint!, no water available, people where even queuing outside the toilets whilst waiting to get in & they hadn't even gotten into the park yet!! I wouldnt have my dog stand in that heat!! To add insult to injury they where letting people who had paid at the park gates skip the queues & go in front of all the people who had been organised enough to get their tickets online!!Once in the park, at this point, drenched with sweat, we found buying a bottle of water pricey! There was an option of buying a refill drinks bottle for $15 then you can fill up the drinks bottle as much as you like after paying an extra 99c (more after tax) however, they only provided sugary drinks, No water options! Again, no water drink fountains either, so they made they're money there!After seeing the waiting times for the rides & some of them a lot longer than advertised we decided to leave after an hour or so. Would not go back. Disorganised & expensive.",lyndaholgate
50,Best Coasters I been on!,"We went Six Flags on a Saturday which seemed like a busy day when people were lining up outside, however once the park opened and we realized how big the park was it wasn't really that busy. We had pre-purchased Flash passes to ensure we got to ride most of the coasters and it was the best thing we could have done. We only purchased the standard flash pass but it stopped us from having to wait in line for most rides.Highlights of the day included the Riddlers Revenge, Superman, Golith and my personal favorite the Tatsu. We also purchased the Six Flags Refill cups which gave us free drink refills all over the park for only $12 each.Overall it was a great day with plenty of rides to try and things to see and do. If you are a thrill seeker like my girlfriend and I, this is the place for you.",Elricho87
40,Great Coasters,"Excellent coasters! Problem is the crowds. They have also reduced their hours which doesn't help. The wait for the new ride Drop of Doom was too long (2 hours), so skipped it.",BigBurgerMan
50,Had a blast!!!,I see this time that security had kept line cutting down to almost none which is great to see.Last few years it was kinda sad because we saw employees letting people cut into the lines. We had a great time this year and we will be back again.,Takopoke8
20,Total Dissappointment,"We were all very excited, however we could only ride just one roller coaster after waiting 2.5 hours on a early Sunday morning. The fastpasses were finished and they cost as much as the tickets, The waiting times do not reflect the truth. There is only one single bus to-from the parking lot. The labeling is poor-visitors kept ending in places they didn't mean to be. We are used to waiting in lines from Disneyworld; I think there was a lack of management here. So we signed and left the place. However all the rollercoasters looked awesome and well kept.",Nese Y
50,Got it done in 1 day,"On a sunday, lines were moderate. Collosus was very very rough. Viper rough on my ears, i'm 5'5. x2, riddler, green lantern all great. Superman & Batman my favorite!",ejhilliker
50,Lots of great rides!,"Absolutely loved this place; had to come back a second time. So many really fun rides, it wasn't possible to do them all in one day. A little expensive, but in the end I found the fun worth it. Definitely recommend it.",Nicole F
50,Great time with baby,"Had a great time, there were no lines I believe it was because it wasn't high season yet. We went with a 6 month old baby, there were no rides he could go on besides the carrousel but he had a great time seeing the big roller coasters go by (while waiting for mom and dad to get back from the ride). There are so many that we couldn't get on all of the rides.",laurar42
40,Best rollercoasters in the world but select your visit time carefully!,"View from a UK visitor: after reading some of the reviews on here we were a little unsure about going but we were very glad we did as the day was a highlight for our three sons, particularly our teenagers. We visited in the last week of August in midweek, arriving before the park opened (note: be aware that the travel time from Anaheim can easily be doubled by the traffic on the Interstate) to find the park relatively empty and we never waited in line more than about fifteen minutes for ANY of the rides (the slowest loading was Green Lantern). The park was clean and tidy and we did not see any people cutting line or causing any trouble whatsoever.And the rides...what can we say? The have the best selection of extreme rollercoasters in the world without any doubt. We rated X2 highest of these and there really is nothing like it, a coaster car that extends outside of the track and rotates through 360 degrees to give a sensational experience! Tatsu was a face down ride which really pulled some G-Force, Revenge Of The Riddler a stand-up coaster, Batman The Ride a suspended coaster (as were Scream and Viper), Goliath a traditional coaster with a huge drop and Green Lantern a unique kind of wild mouse vertical design (tough to ride this one though, it is a vicious beast!). Special mentions for Superman Escape From Krypton as it is still astonishing and the new massive drop ride Lex Luthor. This list just scratches the surface as there were many more and we rode them all even though it wore us out by mid afternoon!The only negatives were the searing heat (it must have been 100F) and be prepared for plenty of walking around as the park is large with many inclines. I would also recommend only taking children if they are 54"" and up so they can ride all the attractions. Definitely not Disneyland but we would strongly recommend making this part of your trip plans!",Mark M
40,A traditional thrill-ride park worth the season ticket,"We live close, so visiting Six Flags each Summer is a no-brainer (because we have children and we are young-at-heart thrill seekers!) This park is never as crowded as the Disney parks or Universal Studios, partly because of the size and the ever-expanding selection of rides. But, beware -- we're talking Mostly Teenagers here. That's good and bad. The ""family"" feel has faded in recent years. If you visit more than once each year, get the Season Pass. The rides are thrilling. The lines get long 2 hours after opening each day. The food is pricey and not healthy. Leaving the park is not a reasonable option for most, so bring food or eat wisely. Overall, Six Flags is NOT the Disney experience (the park upkeep is always mediocre), but the rides rock!",AHSwift
50,Best rides in California,We live in Northern California and make a trip to Magic Mountain when we can. There are rides for our oldest and youngest. The park is always clean and we always feel safe.,Dan R
40,"If you like Rollercoasters, this is the place to be!","A gigantic rollercoaster park in the middle of nowhere! This place was a little crazy! If you are into rollercoasters then this is the place for you. If you don't like them stay away (It would be like going a vegetarian to an all meat restaurant. There was too many good rides here to go through them all, but there was quite a lot of queues. There is a fast pass option, but I'm not to bothered I didn't get it, as you end up spending the whole day there anyway and I left satisfied! But online for cheaper tickets!",Philipstown
50,I like roller coasters,"My children and I have been going here for 20 years. When they were younger we would ""skip school"" for a day and go ride the coasters. Make sure to get there early and plan which rides you really want to get to first.",TravelDonCA
40,Lots of Fun!!!,This was one of the best sixflags I have ever been to. It was clean and the rides were so amazing! I definitely suggest getting at least a gold flash pass its SOOOOO worth the money!!! The food was even good too! I also liked that with one of the games where you shoot the water at the target that even if you lose you win a cape too! Would totally go back!!,Emilynunes
40,Not for the faint of heart!,"We lucked out and timed our visit for the first day of school. Very quiet, no line ups. If you don't like thrill rides this is not the place for you as there isn't much else to do. My hubby had a great time on the coasters..me not so much! Thankfully we knew this going in. The park itself was nicer than I was expecting, food was the usual park fare.",Linda24
40,Awesome Way to Spend a Day,"Seriously, there's not a lot of hidden gimmicks like Disneyland and it was really reasonably priced. Talk about it getting hot walking around that concrete all day so make sure you keep hydrated. The food in the park is nothing short of awful so if you can grab food somewhere else before going in that's advised. I made the mistake of thinking the Goliath looked like a very progressive easy way to start the day. Holy that thing goes 250 in the air and then straight down 200 feet into an underground tunnel with a seemingly low ceiling which makes a 6'6"" guy like me think my head was going to hit the top. The rides were all cool although I admit to not going on all of them as some of them were looking just a little too insane for me. One ride literally stops people over 150 feet above the ground and stops dead with people staring down at the people below face down (no thanks). If you love roller coasters though you'll totally get your money in here and then some. I think I'm cured for quite some time.",canadiansnorkel
40,Awesome roller coasters,"Finally took the family for the 1st time to Magic Mountain. I hadn't been there in over 20 years since I was a teen. The kids,11 and 14, were finally tall enough to ride all the rides and had other roller coaster experience under their belt that I felt they would enjoy the park. Well they had a great time and managed to ride all the roller coasters (except for the kiddie coasters) on Monday, Aug 27th even though the park was only open from 10:30am-6pm and that was WITHOUT A FLASHPASS.If you have a discover card, bring it. You can get into the parks 5 minutes earlier than the general public. When we entered at 10:25am, there were only 14 people in our line and we were numbers 7-10. The general public lines had at least 40 people in each line. The discover card also gives you an instant 5% discount and if you have AAA membership, that also gives you a 10% savings on top of the 5% savings from the discover card for purchases over $14.99. We bought the refillable cup for $14.99 +tax. You get free refills for the 1st day and we must have refilled that cup over 15 times that day as we were all sharing 1 cup and it was over 94 degrees that day. We tried to stay hydrated as we saw a teenager faint in line while waiting for ninja.I had though about spending the money and getting the flashpass after reading many reviews talking about how slow the lines are, but I am glad we didn't. I had warned the kids that we'd probably only be able to ride about 5-6 rides. We actually ended up riding all the rides we wanted to. Here they are in the order we rode them: X2, Viper,Revolution, Tatsu, Roaring Rapids, Ninja, SuperMan, Apocalypse, Jet Stream, Tidal Wave, Green Lantern, Batman, Riddler's Revenge, Tower of Doom, Scream, Colossus, Goliath (2 times) Gold Rusher. Some lines were super short and practically walk ons. The longest waits we had were for Green Lantern (45 min), Superman (40 min), Tatsu (25min).We left Anaheim at 7:30am and were stuck in morning rush hour. We arrived in Valencia at 9:20am. We had a late breakfast at Mimi's Cafe down the street and were parked in the lots by 10:10am. We got in line by 10:15. We left the park at 6:30 and had dinner down the street at a Mexican restaurant and were back on the road at 8pm. There was no traffic and we were back in Anaheim by 9:20pm.The kids had a great time and are asking to go back again the next time we are in CA.",tooele13
50,Great coasters!,"Love this park! X2 is the scariest ride ever (in a good way!).

Even more walking than most theme parks!",James A
50,Mind blowing experience,"The best roller coaster park to visit with your teens I've seen so far. Breathtaking and mindblowing experiecne on variety or rides - X2, Tatsu, Superman, Green Lantern. Platinum pass recommended to maximize the fun and fit it into one day visit otherwise if you are not in time to do all the rides within one day kids will insist returning there next day. Could be extremely sunny & hot in July and August so sunscreen is a must. Food selection somehow limited though better then in SixFlags SF",GregLi707
40,Best roller coasters around!,"I love this park! It has by far the best selection of roller coasters I have ever seen. The first hill on Goliath is quite possibly the greatest thing ever. X2 was terrifying, don't go right after eating (which would probably never happen because it had a 2+ hour wait and no flashpass access). Oh and speaking of the flashpass just get one, seriously. We went for two days and did not get one the first day, we spent over 12 hours there and got in 6 rides, we averaged 2 hour waits for everything, just awful! The second day we got the flashpass and while it wasn't nearly as busy it did get us on some of the rides we didn't manage that first day like Tatsu (which is just great by the way!)As with all theme parks the food selection left something to be desired, I don't eat meat and they did have a sushi place so I had veggie sushi for lunch both days. Of course everything is overpriced, you have to expect it. Probably the best thing ever is the frozen lemonade that they have all over, it's crazy expensive but a must if the temperature is pushing 100 degrees like it was when we were there.The one thing I wish we knew about that first day was the locker situation. On all of the newer coasters you have to rent a locker to put your stuff in, the rental lasts two hours I think so you could potentially go on two rides per rental but realistically you just have to pay $1 to store your stuff for each ride. Also many of them the lockers are in a location that you have to pick up your stuff on the way out. It's much better to rent a day locker which is what we did the second day.Can't wait to go back!",BCluna19
50,Rollercoaster heaven,"Unreal place with some of the best rollercoasters in the world. A large park, everything is spread out, so lots of walking. X2 and Tatsu are the best rides in the park. Not much shade through the park. Platinum Flash Pass was well worth it, considering the amount of time we were there and time of year. Abit hard to get there if you dont have a car, as it is pretty far out. About 45 minutes from Hollywood.",SouthSydney01
40,Great rollercoasters if you like extreme fun,"Really good selection of roller coasters but expect 1-2 hour queues at the most popular attractions. We missed out on Tatsu because of the 2 hour line and couldn't be bothered to stand in the heat for that long. X2 and Goliath were loads of fun, a bit disappointed at myself that I closed my eyes at X2, it was our first ride of the day and I was a bit scared! Was thinking of getting a Flash Pass but it didn't seem worth the money because lines were manageable at other rides except for X2, Tatsu and the new Lex Luthor Drop of Doom. Some of the rides just give you a headache and leave you woozy afterwards but still pretty good fun. Would love to come back to be able to ride Tatsu and see what the fuss is all about!",3ntmonty

50,Great Time! Excellent roller coasters!,"It can get very hot or pretty cool so dress in layers. I even suggest bringing a change of clothes and shoes for after all the water rides! Get a locker, it is expensive but worth it.If at all possible go on a weekday during the school year, you will have SO much fun.",willshawna
10,Avoid the waterpark at all cost...or it will cost you.,"I have visited the main park twice and it has been fine both times. So we visited the water park Hurricane Harbor this trip. What a mistake. The water park is clearly an after thought. I knew were in trouble when we pulled in at 1030 (the park opening time) and could see several rides not open.We waited in the very long and unshaded line to buy tickets. Then we had to wait in the long and unshaded line to rent a locker ($16). Then we had to wait in the long and unshaded line for our first ride. The ride was one of 3 slides one. 45mins for a 20 second slide is not deal. But it gets worse. This park makes you rent the tubes for the slides ($7). If you didn't rent one you have to wait at the bottom of the side for one of the common use tubes to be free. Also the staff was so inefficient that the slides were not in use more than they were. One you had a common use tube then you could go wait at the top...more waiting in the sun. Again this was just for one ride. Seriously awful!Waits are understandable at a theme park ,but water park ride waits are suppose to be shorter because the rides are shorter. This is on the case here. Long lines, long waits while other rides sit dry. We will not be back!",oldensign
40,Amazing!!!!!!,"Me and my friends went to six flags 2 weeks ago and was amazing. The rides there were awesome, mostly the X2 and the Superman Escape from Krypton. The only drawback was that the lines were too long and we could not ride every ride that day. We waited in line for X2 about 2 hours and for the standing rollercoaster about 1 hour. But waiting was totally worth it. I would totally recomend for anyone going to get a flashpass. Another drawback is finding your way through. We spent a long time trying to find tatsu. The map was useless and there weren't any signs telling the direction. I forgot to mention that I also got extremely sick from the park. But overall I think it's fun and enjoyable park. The rides were extreme!!!!!!!!!!!!! I totally recommend it.",Halo87
50,Great day out!,"Really good day out here for the family and friends, spent a whole day here which I'm afraid Is needed to explore all the sites and rides, one thing that should really be purchased is a fast access pass, as the queues can be long at times, but on a whole it was a very good day.",Chris R
50,Fun!,Rides are awesome! X2 will make scream and of curse one of my favorite is superman. waiting lines are not that bad on weekdays,Yo_Win24
30,Amazing Rides,"I went to Six Flags Magic Mountain for the rides and I wasn't disappointed. The coasters here are excellent. However, the park could improve in several ways.Firstly, they are very poor at managing queues, especially in the loading stations, where it was often a free-for-all. The lines were huge (1.5-3 hours on most rides) but we had a platinum flash pass - very expensive but worth it. It isn't a front of line pass, but it gets you straight into the loading area of the rides. We never waited more than 5 minutes to get into a loading area. We did wait up to 30 minutes in some loading areas though, where it was like a cattle market, with people pushing and shoving and generally not quite knowing where to go. This was worse on Superman, where I ended up in a line which was for groups of 2. I was with my 2 kids, but wasn't directed to a particular line. After waiting 20 minutes, I got to the front and saw the tiny sign which said that line was for groups of 2 only. I politely asked a group of 4 if they would mind if I came in to their line, as I had made an honest mistake and waited in the wrong line. They rudely told me to go to the back. This caused a bit of an argument, with others joining in. There were no members of staff in the waiting/loading area. This was very disappointing, as was the rude and abusive behaviour of other guests. I know the park can't be responsible for the behaviour of guests, but they could manage the queues better.It was very hot, but most of the water fountains didn't work. We spent $50 on drinks in one day. Food and drinks are expensive and you're not allowed to take your own.X2 and Drop of Doom aren't included with the flash pass, but you can pay $15 per person per ride for flash passes for these. Total rip off. These should be included with the platinum flash pass.I paid for tickets and the flash pass in the UK, but on arriving at the park, I had to join the regular line to collect my flash pass. I waited for this for 50 minutes, which ruined my plan of going on X2 before it got busy. If you're getting a flash pass, go on X2 first, and maybe even Drop of Doom, then collect your flash pass. I wish I'd have done this.I didn't get on either of these rides.Lots of rides broke down throughout the day and some hardly ran, which was disappointing.Overall, I loved the rides, but there were other things which didn't run smoothly. This is a good park, which could be a fantastic park if a few changes were made, which would improve the overall atmosphere and enjoyability for all guests.",ladyraceruk
40,fantastic rollercoasters,"very hot and a lot of people!! I suggest, once you go there, the flash pass. Otherwise the lines will destroy you! with the pass you do a rollercoaster every 40 minutes, without it's about 1.30-2.00 hours each!! They are the greatest in the world!",pera64
50,Awesome!!,Had a blast!!! Favorite rides were superman escape from krypton and tatsu. It was EXTREMELY hot the day we were there (11 August) we bought a water squirted with a fan on it and still struggled with the heat. Remember to drink lots of water. We got a gold flash pass and thought it was worth it.,Miss-Rotary
40,"Fun, but too hot this weekend",There is very little shade; take a spray bottle with you. New Lex Luthor ride is fun; but X2 and Tatsu are still the best coasters there.,Hawaiian Will
10,Handicap nightmare,"We have been to Disneyland, Knot's berry, Disney World, Epcot, Universal studios LA,Sea world, San Diego zoo, Disney animal kingdom, etc. Every park we have been to in the past have been super nice, and have bent over backwards to accommodate my husband and I who are both handicapped. I had called ahead to find out if they had a Handicapped friendly park for the disabled. They assured me they were and did have a handicapped pass I could pick up at customer assistance office just inside the park. We arrived before the park opened so that we could get an early start before the crowds. We picked up the pass, and preceded to the first ride. At any other park you go to a ride or show where you enter the attraction and they either give you a time and pass to come back or you are escorted through the fast pass line. If you have to come back at another time you are allowed to proceed to another attraction where you enter it and use the disabled pass to gain access to that ride, or at least get a time to come back later.At Six Flags we went to the first ride entrance showed our pass and was told we had to walk to the exit of the ride to get a time to come back since the line was long. It was a roller coaster ride and a very long walk to the exit. We walked to the exit only to be told to come back in two hours, and to come back to the exit of the ride. so we proceeded to make our way back and went to the next ride, The park has a fairly steep winding path to the attractions. The next ride told us we could not get a time to return or access the ride until the two hours had passed for the first ride that stamped the pass! ??? YOU CAN GET A RETURN TIME FOR ONE RIDE AT A TIME, AND NOT BE ABLE TO HAVE ACCESS TO ANY OTHER ATTRACTIONS IN THE PARK! SERIOUSLY? AND I HAVE TO WALK TWICE AS FAR TO THE EXIT OF THE RIDE TO GET THE TIME AND THEN WALK TO ANOTHER RIDE WAIT IN THE REGULAR LINE FOR GOD KNOWS HOW LONG. THEN RETURN TO THE FIRST RIDE WALK ALL THE WAY TO THE EXIT AGAIN 1/4 MILE OR SO GET IN LINE AND STILL WAIT ANOTHER 20 MIN. AND AFTER THE RIDE YOU GET TO WALK BACK 1/4 MILE TO THE FRONT, Surly this is a mistake. My husband and I have both had crushed legs in the past and walk with a limp, short distances. We both have just recovered form having surgery, chemo, from Cancer. We were there to treat our 18 yr. old daughter graduating from high school to a trip to California and Roller coasters. How can you do that if you can't get on the rides? Went back to the customer relations office and were told one ride at a time no exceptions! What good is this stupid pass? You could sit at the ride exit for two hours they told us. We had been there one hour and fifteen min. since the park opened. We asked for our tickets to be refunded since we will never be able to wait standing in the long lines, or have a chance to ride more than a couple of rides. They refused to give us a refund, that they didn't care the pass only covered one ride at a time that was their policy. IF WE WOULD LIKE TO WE COULD PURCHASE A FRONT OF THE LINE FAST PASS FOR ANOTHER $80+ PER PERSON FOR THE THREE OF US. We left the office and decided to try to make the best of a BAD situation since we were already there and our teen wanted to have fun. The next ride we went to was a coaster with a long line, got the time to come back and went to the water rapid ride across from it. It had a 20 min. wait with railings you could lean against while waiting. We have been on many a water ride, and you know you will get splashed. This ride drenched everyone in the boat totally soaked beyond belief, actually dripping from head to sneakers freezing cold water WET! There was no sign saying how wet you would get as a warning. The day was cloudy and windy, my daughter had goose bumps and we all called it quits! This park is the WORST ever! You like BIG roller coasters go to Knotts Berry farms. Great park They have a great handicapped attitude, very nice staff,beautiful park that has no hills and you will get to ride all the rides in one day at least once! Six Flags Magic Mountain is just out to make a buck off you and they don't care about their guests.",mthood3
50,Still an AWESOME amusement park!,"We have been several times over the years and this is still a great park--we LOVED it! It was clean, well-staffed, etc. I would advise that if you go in the summer months, get a ""flash pass"" because it REALLY makes a difference on your day--we had almost no waiting on most of the rides! We always get the ""gold"" flash pass because the regular one doesn't do much and we find the platinum one to be unnecessary for our family's needs but please do the research which one works best for you. It is MORE than worth the extra money because when you don't have to wait in line, your day at the park is MUCH different for sure! We are not California residents with season passes so we wanted to pack in as much as possible during the 2 days we spent at the park and I wouldn't do it any other way! Also, buying the $14.99 all-you-can-drink cup with free refills for the day was a great money saver as we would just wipe off the straw end and share the drink amongst our family members. We also got free refills in the cup on the 2nd. day when we took the cup back--great deal!",CdnWhoLovesToTravel
40,Less commercial more fun,All the good rides without the 'Disney' and commercial pressure of the 'other' parks. A little less sparkle but more bang for your buck. Get a season ticket on week two or your three week stay and use it again the year after in week 1 of your holiday.,PBerkeley
50,it is what it is...,"Love Magic Mountain but things have changed since i was a kid. OVER PRICED, my niece lost her phone & bcuz it landed in a restricted area, they wouldnt go get it 4 her. BS!!! They really should limit the amount of people they let in!!",Erika O
40,First Time Visit-Enjoyed The Park!,"Magic Mountain was on the bucket list of amusement parks I always wanted to attend. I am an avid roller coaster rider. (We live in the Midwest). The park was situated in an area, surrounded by breaktaking views of the mountains. While the park is similar to other Six Flags parks, the different types of roller coasters available made the visit worthwhile for us. All of the employees were very friendly, and the park was very clean. We went on a Wednesday, and shortly after they opened, so we didn't buy the FlashPass that was available to help you move through the lines faster. We were able to get on all of the rides that we wanted to except for the Green Lantern -- around 3:00, the line was at an hour long. I could see how this park could easily get very crowded and require the need for a Flash Pass. We ate lunch at Johnny Rockets, typical amusement park fare at amusement park costs. I'd suggest tailgating in your car by packing a lunch.It was a bit of a challenge to find a building with air conditioning at a temperature low enough to help you cool off, but there were misting stations located in the park. Ultimately the heat won out and we left. There are also some hills to climb to get to some of the rides so you will get a workout.For most of the big rides, you will need to put your belongings into a locker, which for the most part were conveniently located and we did use them($1). I thought I would be able to get on Superman with my crossbody bag, but had to leave my bag with the attendant. I never do that as a regular practice, sincee you can't trust anyone these days -- as noted by the review ""robbed"", but I didn't have a choice.Luckily this ride only had one car, so you had to return to the original spot before others could ride.If you like roller coasters, I'd say this is one park to add to your list for at least one visit.",Mary Ann N
50,What a great day!,"Visited Six Flag's Magic Mountain August 2012 - if you like roller coasters this is the place to go. My 2 teenage sons (and husband) had the best day ever riding all the costers. My daughter and I only ended up going on may 10 or so rides as were not the thrill seekers the boys are but we still had a great day. We went on a Saturday - which was not the best idea - sooo crowded. After standing in a line for over an hour we decided to do the fast pass otherwise there was no way we were going to be able to do even half the rides. As far as the fast pass goes TOTAL RIP OFF....so expensive - a total money grab compared to other parks - it was over $200 to get only 3 of them! I was appalled - but what can I say, we did it anyway and it does do exactly what you say - gets you on the ride basically right away - we saved so much time and got to do everything we wanted. As usual the food and drinks were also ridiculously expensive but that goes without saying at these types of parks. Overall had an awesome day but it's not a place for the faint at heart! Have fun!",NanaimoGirl66
50,Awesome new 400 foot ride,"Wow again, actually joined up this year, new rode on the side of superman it takes you up 400 foot in a chair with knee harnesses and straps, then politely drops you 400foot down wow quite amazing, all other rides are of the usual great standard, service good and food and drinks are reasonable too. Great day againThank you 6 flags",rickyk
40,Like rollercoasters?,"Then this is the place to go. I love this place. Lot's of walking of course but a nice park to visit if you are a roller coaster lover. I bring my lunch (in ice chest) and take a break midday to eat outside on the small grass area, saves a bit of $ and you can eat healthy. Awesome caramel apples sold in the back area.",heidisb
10,ROBBED!,"My daughter and her college aged friends drove to Six Flags on Sunday for a final day of fun before school resumes. The day was going well, despite the tremendous heat and extremely long lines. The girls still reported having fun while working hard to stay cool. The day took a terrible turn at the Bat Man ride. The ride attendants do not allow any items to be taken on the rides and for some reason the lockers were conveniently ""Under Construction"". ?.. The ride attendants told the girls to leave their belongings with them, and so they did. The girls placed their bags directly next to the ride attendant. Of course, after the ride, two of the girls's bags were gone...and you guessed it...ride attendant knew nothing about it!! The park security were less than helpful and told the girls they were not responsible since there were other lockers located elsewhere in the park. COME ON! After waiting an hour in the heat, the girls were supposed to exit the line to find other lockers when the ride attendant told them to leave their belongings with them? Sounds quite fishy to me.The bags were later found in the nearby men's bathroom. Of course all cash was gone along with their cell phones. Luckily my daughers credit cards and ID were still there. Her friend did not fair so well. Her cards and ID were stolen and her bag had been peed on by the thief.I will never suggest this park to anyone after this incident. I believe the park took responsibility of their belongings when they told the girls to place the bags with them. Luckily, their car keys were in the one bag that was not stolen, or these young girls would have been left with No money and no way to get home.",Stacey M
50,A fantastic day out - go!!!,"In brief we loved this place - arrived 930 left at 730 and didn't do anywhere near all the rides despite having a Flash Pass on a busy day. For UK visitors this makes Alton Towers look like a travelling fair.HINTS and TIPSFirst off this is most suitable for roller coaster junkies.We arrived 930 and car parks opened then were held at the gate till opening at 1030. We had pre-paid our tickets and Flash Pass online at Six Flags website - Do This!!!!!Gates opened 1030 straight ahead was the Flash Pass office. Here you're held while you watch a video explaining how it works. You then proceed to pay/collect. Lose it or break it you pay $250. You must show and leave ID for each unit good for up to four people - see online for costs it's worth it.The Flash Pass lets you jump the queue to varying degrees whether you have Standard, Gold or Platinum - they cost more the better they are - we had Gold and this was ample. The only bonus with platinum is that you get to ride each ride twice back to back if you so wish - don't bother you have rides to do!Once you have selected your queue jump ride go there at the appointed time or later - you have a place reserved. Once you have entered the Flash Pass queue usually down the exit, a member of staff will scan you in.Now the important bit - straight away pick your next ride, ideally one nearby and reserve your queue place. End result is once you've ridden one coaster you're straight onto the next.The only drawback is that they don't count for the two big ticket rides - Dr Doom and the X ride - just queue for these straight away properly or leave them till laterSix Flags is highly recommended just budget for Flash Pass and take a change of underwear!",THEBFB
50,Fun Fun Fun,"Brilliant fun. Our daughter was unable to walk, so we hire a electic wheelchair at a reasoable price so we could fully enjoy the park.The entrance is expensive but it is worth it as it has some awsome rides.Not much shade. Not enough food or drink outlets so you will queue. There are a couple of areas with vending machines which sell vitamin water, coke etc and these don't seem to have queue's they take both cash and credit card which is helpful.",Tams_tours_10
50,Excelent park,I love six flags specially because i live like 30 mins away is and easy and kind of inexpensive way to get away for the evenngs when the park is empty we are a family of 5 and we lve it especially because we got the season pass and parking pass so we dont spend much money every time we o try the funnel cakes they are amazing,Maritolachi
50,"Worth the price, great day :D","I would definately recommend this place, before you go, either book 3 days in advance and save $25 or just book online and save $20.... I would not recommend going with roller coaster lovers if you are not a fan yourself as you will do a lot of sitting around as my mum found out. We went on Monday 9th of July, we arrived at around 10:30 and were expecting huge queues but we only waited 5 mins for colossus and scream. We walked straight on to batman and viper. It was a very hot day so we waited about 30 mins for tidal wave (NOT WORTH WAIT) and about 45 mins for the rapids (would have been worth 30 mins) ..... We had to wait about 30 mins for riddlers revenge but whatever the wait it is soo worth it!!! We waited 20 mins or so for Goliath. We did not ride tatsu as there was a 90 min wait and it didn't look worth it!! Neither did we ride x2 none of us were fussed on it :s the park was clean and the staff were helpful and friendly!! Also a lot of people were there to ride the new lex luthor ride which was over an hour queue all day as it opened only 2 days earlier!! For all thrill seekers I seriously advise going if you are nearby :D have a good trip :)",Jane250
40,"Food and Drinks A bit expensive, overall a great experience","Although it was very warm outside, I was surprised of the number of shady areas for sitting and relaxing, Loved the misting fans!Very clean all around the staff always polite although they see so many faces, always nice.",HDmom
40,This place is a blast.....,"I've always wanted to got o Six Flags and finally got the chance to this summer. I found the enterance price to be very fair. However the food prices are INSANE. They don't allow you to bring in outside food, because they know you will cause the prices are high. I felt like they could have done alittle bit better with the outdoor cooling system. It was ridiculously hot outside. And it's called Magic Mountain because there's a section in the park where you're practically climbing one. Parking is about a mile away. I wish they would have had more trams going back and forth. But once you get over all of that, the park is amazing. We only spend one day there. And didn't get to do everything. So I recommend going for 2 days if you can. The roller coasters are great. I liked how no two were the same. The lines are super long. So if you can afford a front of the line pass, it might be a good idea, expecially if you're only there for one day. Once it gets later, the park does slow down a bit, and we were able to ride our favorite rides a couple times before leaving. Overall, this place is great. Id go back.",travelcosmolady
40,Magic Mountain great fun for coaster lovers!,"We visited Six Flags Magic Mountain on Monday, July 30th. We arrived around noon and stayed until the last rides closed, around 9:30 pm. We had $20 off coupons so paid around $40 per person (group of 15) at the gate. It was probably mid 80's, so it was very hot in the lines...strongly recommend bringing your own water to drink and food as prices at the park for food are ridiculously expensive. We used a locker ($15) to store our water and food.The lines were not too bad, considering the longest we waited was 90 minutes for X2 when we first arrived. As the day progressed the lines for the best coasters seemed to dwindle to about 30-45 minute wait. Bathrooms were below par in our book...few and far between and not very clean. Now for the rides:X2 & Tatsu: These two were our favorite rides...nothing compares to these rides in my opinion, they simply were the funnest, scariest, craziest rides we went on. Fast, exhilarating, scary, fun...indescribable may be the best word! We rode both of these twice (once during the day and once when it got dark) and they were an absolute blast!!Goliath: The drop on this ride and the speed are what I remember most...what a great coaster! It felt every bit of 85mph as you were going down the first drop, as well as the remainder of the ride...fun!Viper: Least favorite of the rides we road, this coaster shows it's age with the way it throws you around in the small car...not nearly as fun or comfortable as X2, Tatsu, or Goliath, but still a good coaster considering there are a total of 7 loops and 2 corkscrews. Also we had to wait maybe 5 minutes for this ride.Scream: Another great coaster, this and Goliath we only rode once due to time constraints but we definitely would ride it more if we had the time. Not quite as good as Tatsu and X2, but still an excellent coaster with lines a little shorter so that was nice.Overall we had a great time riding the coasters at Magic Mountain. Our only complaint was we ran out of time to ride all the one's on our list. If we ever return we will DEFINITELY purchase a 'Fast-Pass' as this would be worth every penny when it comes to getting your money's worth riding the rides. Not only would we have been able to ride all the rides on our list, but it would have allowed us to ride our favorite rides as many times as we wanted!",coaster999
30,Our Experience,Family of five in the last part of July going to Magic Mountain. The kids were excited about the best rides ever. The roller coaster rides were an 8 on a scale from 1 to 10. The lines were ridicously long and the food was way expensive. We could of got the fast pass and waited less but that would of been another 165.00. We waited 2hrs for a ride that broke down . The Wave Tide ride was really disappointing after waiting in line for 30minutes. We did not like the wait in the lines and the food and drink prices. Especially for a family of five it gets expesive and irritating.,Las Vegas Rock Crawlers
40,Terrific park for coaster enthusiasts,"For a coaster enthusiast, Magic Mountain is a terrific experience. If you are looking for a pleasant day in a pretty amusement park, this isn't the place to go. However, in terms of the quality of the collection of rides, the only parks in the country that eclipse it are Cedar Point and Six Flags Great Adventure. Line management is an issue, and we bought the gold fast pass (it is totallty unnecessary to splurge for the platinum). We got on every roller coaster at least once, and X2 and Lex Luthor twice (you have to buy an upcharge for flash pass for X2, and we waited an hour for second ride on X2 and both times on Lex Luthor without the flash pass). Otherwise, with the flash pass, the longest wait was 10 minutes (Tatsu and Green Lantern). In terms of the complaints in previous posts, almost all large amusement parks in the country charge ridiculous prices for poor quality food. You just have to expect that when you go to (most) theme parks. In terms of the clientele, the only issue we had was an unbelievable amount of line jumpers on Lex Luthor at the end of the day. Otherwise, we felt safe. I did not think the park (bathrooms or otherwise) was dirty as many people complain, it is just not a beautiful place, but no Six Flags park I have been to is. If you are looking for the best ride experience on the west coast, this is the place. If you are looking for a fun day doing various activities (especially with smaller children) in a highly themed parked with over the top pleasant staff, you are much better off going to Knotts, Disney, or Universal.",Jeffrey M
10,I looked at my statement had 6 purchases when I only made three at six flags .... scary huh,So I recently went to six flags Valencia and Look at my bank statement and I saw 6 six flags charges when there only should have been 3 and So I call six flags they tell me to dispute it with my bank etc and every person I talk to was RUDE .... First off they should ask for i.d and I don't know how its possible for them to charge my card 3 different charges when i have my card ...,Melyssa P
30,Good but lines are just stupid,"I would definitely recommend to buy express passes and we were waiting in lines for hours - we didn't know about the passes (oh how we wish we would know about this before). The park is not very well organized, attractions are all over without any clear vision. You get the map when you enter but still very confusing.It has really good rides but we still prefer Knotts Berry Farm, so much more of a theme park.",Sport_guy_23
50,Best Amusement Park Ever!,"Roller Coasters are GREAT!!Best rides: Goliath, Lex Luthor: Drop of Doom, Scream, Riddler's Revenge, Tatsu, Apocalypse, Superman Escape from Krypton.Not as good:Viper, Revolution, Batman, Gold Rusher.All of the others are good just not excellent.",Brad755
50,The Kids LOVE us LOTS MORE!,"We visited June 8, 2012 the first time to Magic Mountain. We were ten of three families - 10 year old to 67 years. We had the most FUNtastic time of our lives. The Fast Track Pass was definitely a great advantage at the most popular rides.We split in two groups 5 each - one for the craziest rides, and the other for the 'saner' ones. We met for lunch and the 13 to 40 years young ones were just raving how much they were enjoying themselves, as our group also did through the eyes of the two 10 & 12 year old ones.Six hours at SiX we spent and it was indeed a memorable day. The staff at the rides, restaurants and even the candy floss sales girl all were smiling to serve and delight the 'guests' and we were treated to a home coming.HATS OFF to the NEW Management of SiX Flags. It is North America's GREATEST Entertainment Company for families to go there and have FUN Day & BOND.",Haamid J
50,Very fun!,"If you like crazy rides this is the place to go! My fiancee was over the moon excited here, for me it was a bit too much but it is very popular. Get the fast pass to avoid waiting in long lines!",mrsktm
40,Long lines. LOTS of roller coasters,"If you love roller coasters, yay! But the lines are long and it can be very hot outside. They do have some misters, but not nearly enough. It was only 94 degrees outside when we went but it does get hotter!!! Remember, no white T-shirts on water rides. You will get wet AND you will be transparent.",breezebaby
40,fun but..,"six flags is a very fun place to be if you enjoy dangerous rides, however the wait time is crazy!we were 4 and we bought the most expensive fast track they gave us a beeper and asked us to reserve before entering the ride! unfortunately it wasnt worth the 400+$ we have paid for it! it just lets you skip some of the line but you still get to line for 15-20 minutes!we also couldnt ride the superman ride because it was full!! what did we pay this amount for then!however if i went to six flags again i would go for the cheaper fast tracks!",mashaelaa
50,it is very FUN !,i enjoyed myself here aolt and cant wait until my next vacation to return to this amusment park. i had a blast during my visit. i felt like a big kid again,RaeAnna W
40,Too many bees.,"I was having a really great time... Until I sat down to eat. My god. You'd think the park was built on a colony of beehives. The bees came around 3 separate times, each time bringing 3-4 bees. My uneducated guess is that the surplus of bees are around due to the low upkeep around dining areas.",Chrysu
20,Incredibly long wait times,"I lined up for most of the biggest rides without the fast pass thing and had to wait around 1.5 - 2 hours for each of the rides. By the end of the day, I'd lined up to 5 rides and only got to ride 3 of them because I couldn't fit in the restraints. Don't bother going to this park if you are a large person. You're wasting your time. At least they have those water misters and covered line areas so you didn't get sun burnt or overly dehydrated.Bathroom facilities are pathetic! There was only FOUR stalls in the ladies restroom. I even had to line up for 30-45 minutes just to use the restrooms.You'd definitely need at least 2 days to cover all the rides or pay extra for a fast pass thing. Also try not to carry too much as they dont really have storage areas on the rides.",Katrina T
30,"Great rides, but complex bureaucracy","The rides are good, but we were there a busy Saturday in July, and the park was crowded. We paid a lot to skip the lines. The park seems to be badly managed. There is a product orientation but a poor customer orientation. Too complex Flash pass system. We had bought our pass online, and queued forever to obtain them. Even had to watch a movie. Complicated system regarding which rides you could ride twice or not, which were closed, which you had to pay even extra for and that you had to commit to a certain slot to experience X2. We tried to carry with us as little as possible, and came to the park only with our credit card (with ID on it) and ticket. This caused trouble in getting the flash pass device. We had to accept 250$ beeing drawn from our credit card, being returned as we returned the device, but ONLY if we could present the paper receit. If we lost the receit, the money were gone. Unacceptable policy. The park should have a system where accidents or malfunction of the devices were covered. Building structures in the park is not supporting the flash pass system, we had to enter through the exits. Staff was nice enough, but there was little effort made to secure that every ride was filled up. When customers queue for hours, it is strange that there are no single rider lines to ensure capacity utilisation. Especially the two for one ride option for our platinum passes seemed to cause stir among the waiting crowd. People who wanted to ride together, stood ready by the gates - when the previous riders opted to ride again, the people in front of line opted to wait until the next time the desired number of seats were available - staff did rarely manage the crowd to fill up the empty seats, and to see empty seats regularly leave the platform, is annoying. It seems the park have almost the same problems as the staff did in evacuating The Titanic, where inability to fill up the life boats resulted in empty life boats leaving the ship. We visited Universal Studios the day after - they had a simpler system and single rider lines. In addition, Six Flags Magic Mountain should learn from Walt Disney: when in a park, you spend most of your time waiting in line, and just a fraction of the time on the rides. So make the lines fun! Present a story along the way. They do not do that yet.",Britt R
10,Don't bother if you need a wheelchair,"I have been comming here every year since 1996 to celebrate my husbands and mine wedding anniversary. Unforatunately, due to car accident, I needed a wheelchair, not only did people at the rides have no idea how to do that and ignored us, but the elevator to two rides were broken, when I needed to go to the hotel and lie down and wanted to park the wheelchair back at the place, but still hold on to my key, they wanted me to turn it in and pay another 40 dollars to rent it out again.I even read them back the contract, and they didn't care that that was not wrtten in it. While waiting in line to get a soda, my husband went up to the window, and the guy closed the window on him, and he had to get back in line. waitied 1 1/2 hours at the pretzel shop by Tatzu to get a freaken soda. Went to do twicket and they said since we bought our tickets online that they would not do it and told my husband and I to go to the cyber cafe in the park, pay to use the computers and then order more tickets online. This used to be my faviorte place to go for the pack 16 years, but now I question wheter it is worth the hundreds of dollars to come here ever again. Unfortuantley I wil remember this anniversary for the wrong reasons!! I even spoke to the director and manager who said sorry, and to have a nice day!!! REALLY!!! One of the superviors just said it isn't normally this bad, but it is a busy weekend and that I have to expect these things!!!! Thank you to Oscar, Rachel, Jessee and Matthew for being the ONLY people in the whole park to give a care about coustomers!!!",Andrea S
20,"Many nice rides, but not a vell managed park","Many of the rides are very impresssive and worth the prices, but some are also quite old, and nothing to write home about. Go for the newest rides with the best technologi, and skip the rest.Flashcard system advanced, we ordered and paid on line, but had to wait 45min just for the pick it up. We queued to avoid the queued! On some rides the system worked fine and you got in front of the cue, and others it diddent. Flashcard system has abviosusly been introdused without sufficient planning and infrastructure rebuild. Some of the rides wasn't made for the system at all.No solution for the possible damage fee for the Flashcard unit for non US recidents was precented. Other that actually pay the fee, and get it reversed with many days in delay - for 250$ this is an unaccetable solution. We got a small receipt and if that was lost so was the 250€. Unbeliavable !!!!Park management - get your grip together!",Anders R
50,Six flags theme park,We arrived at 10 am. Parking costs $15 not cheap when tickets cost $50 to get in the park. The park is massive I have a tip to get on more rides. You should head for the help desk and ask for a form that gets you on the rides much quicker. They will ask if you have trouble standing up for long periods. They will then give you a form with your name on it and how many people in your group.Find a ride you want to go on and head up to the exit of the ride. Get a member of staff to give you a time to come back and ride the roller coaster with no queuing the ticket does that for you.My favorite ride was superman escape from krypton. I also loved X2 riddlers revenge is a stand up coaster and very smooth. I went on 12 coaster all day and loved every minute of it.,Steven C
40,Fun for the family!,Be prepared to do a lot of walking and wear good shoes!,Heather M
40,Great roller coasters,"If you like roller coasters, this is a great place to visit. The X2 coaster is one of the most unique and intense rides I've ever been on. It flips you on your back and takes you backwards through the ride. The Riddler's Revenge is a very good stand-up coaster. The Batman coaster is an inverted dangling coaster. The front seats are awesome.There are also lots of other roller coasters. We didn't have time to ride all of them. I've been to Cedar Point in Ohio, which is the roller coaster capitol of America, and this was just as good.On the negative side, the lines were very slow moving and inefficient, which was surprising on a Wednesday. My 16-year-old son insisted that they are intentionally inefficient to force people to buy the Flash Pass. However, it did seem to improve a little later in the day.Also, keep in mind that this is Six Flags, not Disneyland or Universal Studios, so don't expect the same cleanliness or attention to detail. On the other hand, if you love thrill rides, this is the place to be.",wrv24
50,Definitely the most amazing theme park - even if we are 21!,"Had the most amazing day ever!SO many rides, that are unlike anything you would ever go on. Highly recommend doing the fast pass - it works out really well even though it is a bit more expensive, as the computer will 'hold' your place in the que, so when you're ready to go on the ride, you just turn up and go straight on.To get there, we went through Star Line tours and I would highly recommend them.. They picked us up from our hotel (in Beverly Hills) at around 7am, took us to the main office where they select the bus you will take, and then you're driven for around 45 minutes there. It was very cheap and professional service. It also was a better option than driving and having to worry about parking etc. They then meet you out front at around 5pm, and take you back to your hotel.",Gemma H
40,Flash pass was well used!!!!,"We visited here on 6/25/12, and the weather was perfect! We were a family of three and had pre-purchased out tickets and a platinum flash passes. The pass allowed us to go to the front of the line on 90% of the rides and even ride it twice before getting off...best money ever spent, especially since we only had the day to spend there. We ate a little breakfast prior to arriving and since we were riding rollercoasters all day, did not spend too much on food. Definitely purchase your tickets prior to arriving...you'll save nearly $30 pp. There seemed to be plenty of spots to sit and enjoy the shade and the misters were so nice to walk through! There is a people mover that takes you to the top of the hill, and I would recommend you take and and move downwards to ride the rides. Best ride ever? Tatsu!!!!",ThePoshTravelinggirl
50,Fun day for my thrill seeking daughter of 13,"I believe I was the oldest person in the park and didn't take any rides. I came to support my 13 year old daughter who loves all the thrilling rides. I wasn't looking forward to the day, but I was pleasantly surprised. The park has lots of shade producing trees and interesting ground covers, even with signage to describe what they are doing. I realize this isn't why people are here, but I found the landscape provided beauty and all important shade during a cloudless, hot July day. I got my daughter a Platinum FlashPast, a computerized device that reserves ride times on selected rides: there were 15 on the day we went. I also purchased $15 tickets for X2 and Drop Doom, which allowed us to reserve a time. With Platinum there was virtually zero wait times. This was great! I found the park clean and easy to navigate with lots of signs and support. I would have enjoyed more benches. Many were sitting on the walls and ground, including me. We also went to Disneyland and Universal Studios and I was surprised to find Six Flags Magic Mountain compared favorably.",StevenKauai
40,Thrilling,"Great Rides, expensive if you upgrade your tickets, Gold is the best bet, didn't think Platinum was worth the extra spend.",samrox5
50,soo fun,i had a great time. the ride a soo much fun and if u have small childeren they have rides 4 them and great rollercoasters.,GioNocera_
50,Fantastic Day at Magic Mountain on a Saturday in the Summer!,"We had an awesome visit to Six Flags Magic Mountain on a Saturday in the summer without buying a Flash Pass! The info in this review explains it all!I, along with my husband, 11 year old daughter and her girlfriend went to Magic Mountain on Saturday 7/14/12. Both our daughter and her friend love roller coasters and thrill rides, and had never been to Magic Mountain. Both were at least 54"" tall to ride the best thrill rides.First, buy your tickets online. Admission price at the door is $64.99. Tix online are $44.99. With 3 days notice, tix online are $39.99 (the same as the price for a child.) There is a $5.99 processing fee. And if you use your Discover card, you will get a 5% discount. Even better is if you’re a AAA member, go to www.aaa.com/sixflags and tickets are only $34.99 with no processing fee. The AAA rate is the best price. By printing out your tickets, you don’t have to go to the ticket booth; you can go straight to the turnstile gate entrance at the park.There’s no need to pre-purchase parking. It’s $17 at the parking gate. Use your Discover card to get 5% off the parking fee.I highly recommend that you don’t bring a bag or purse. You can bring a small fanny pack. Wear cargo pants or cargo shorts with pockets that close with zippers, buttons, velcro, etc. You will need to secure your cell phone, sunglasses, and money in your pockets. Only one of us had a small backpack to carry water and snacks.You’re not supposed to bring food or drink into the park. It matters how much you bring and who is looking through your stuff. We were able to bring in 2 frozen water bottles and a 3rd bottle of water. We also had an apple and trail mix.Wear comfortable tennis shoes. You’ll be doing a lot of walking and there are hills! Don’t wear flip flops or sandals that don’t have good arch support. Wear sunscreen, a hat, and sunglasses. Bring your Discover card and AAA card if you have them.I highly recommend arriving before the park opens. The day we went, the park opened at 10am, so we arrived around 9:40am.If you’re not a Discover card holder, it’s worth getting one before you visit Magic Mountain. If you’re a Discover card holder, there is a separate private entrance AND you get to enter the park 5 minutes early! This was an awesome benefit. When we arrived at 9:40am, there was already a bunch of people in line since it was a Saturday. But at the Discover entrance, we were 4th in line and ending up being the first people to enter the park!We ran to X2 and were the first ones there, so we got the front seat of the very first ride! After X2, we went straight to Tatsu and waited less than 5 minutes –so we rode two of the best rides in the park before 10:20am! That was awesome! The rest of the day, we paced ourselves and took our time. I will say that if you or your kids aren’t used to “max thrill” roller coasters, X2 may not be the best choice for the first ride of the day, or sit in the middle. The front row is a rougher ride.My favorite rides were:Tatsu – the world’s tallest, fastest and longest flying coaster.X2 – a max thrill ride, the world’s first 5th dimensional thrill.The Riddler’s Revenge – the world’s tallest and fastest stand-up roller coaster.Lex Luthor: Drop of Doom – the world’s tallest vertical drop at 400 feet high and falling at 85 mph!Goliath – the first drop at 255 feet into a 120 foot underground tunnel at 85 mph is amazing!We also rode Jet Stream, Ninja, Colossus, and Roaring Rapids.We wanted to ride Scream, but didn’t get to go on it –we saw them running “test” runs with empty cars so we bailed on that line to go catch Riddler’s Revenge, which worked out great because we also got to get in a second ride on Tatsu in the dark before closing.Loose articles are not permitted on most of the rides. You’ll see a lot of signs telling you that you have to use a locker, but you can save the $1 and really don’t have to use them to lock up your personal belongings. On almost all of the rides, you’re able to put your backpack, hat, or drink bottle off to the side of the ride. But keep your cell phone and money in your cargo pant pockets.It’s worth getting a Souvenir Drink Bottle for $14.99 because you get free refills all day. And if you use the bottle again the same year, refills are $0.99 cents. Again, use your Discover Card to get 5% off. Also, they sell the Souvenir Drink Bottles while you’re waiting in line before the park opens. If you buy it then, it’s only $12! We all shared one drink bottle and refilled it about 8-9 times throughout the day!For lunch, we ended up eating at Katy’s Kettle. A burger with fries is $9.99 minus 5% with the Discover Card. Later in the day, we ate at Food Etc., an indoor air-conditioned food court, where they had sushi, fish n chips, tacos, quesadillas, etc. The best food deal was the sushi – 12 pieces was $6.99. The most expensive sushi was $9.99. This is about the same prices as a regular store. The jalapeno fish n chips was $10.49 and tasted pretty good. It had two large fish pieces with fries. My husband and I shared one order, and the two girls shared one regular order $9.99). Unfortunately, they ran out of tartar sauce, and by 6:30pm, they ran out of ice! So if you wanted a drink, there was no ice!I wanted to try Panda Express or Los Cuates Mexican Grill but we weren’t near those restaurants when we were hungry. If you want a full-service sit-down restaurant, there’s the Mooseburger Lodge, which I heard was pretty good.After lunch, the wait time got really long. We waited two hours for Roaring Rapids. It was popular because it was so hot at about 94 degrees. That was the only mistake of the day to waste those two hours. The only reason the girls wanted to ride Roaring Rapids was to get soaked, and then they barely got wet! Only about two out of the 12 people in the raft got really wet. If it’s scorching out and the only reason you want to ride is to get wet- save the 2 hour line and head to the splash pad and get as wet as you want in seconds!We took a break and went shopping at the gift shop. With any $15 minimum purchase, show your AAA card to get 10% off your purchase. And if you use your Discover card, you’ll get an additional 5% off! You can leave your purchases and arrange for a package pick-up at the Looney Tunes gift store at the end of your stay.The park closed at 10pm. We wanted to ride Tatsu again at night and we got in line at 9:15pm. We were told that as long as you’re in line by 10pm, you are guaranteed to get on the ride. We got on the ride by about 10:15pm. And we got to ride in the front row! Tatsu is a very cool ride to ride at night!We had an awesome day at Magic Mountain and would definitely come back!",JennShio
10,If you get scare on the rides... better to stay away from here,Most of the rides were too much for me :( couldn't find anything that looked not-so scary :P,LaQueenNo1
40,"Much better than expected, will visit Superman again","Superior selection of roller coasters and thrill rides, in a huge yet walkable and largely shaded expanse - and Superman is the best amusement park thrill ride in the world, bar none. Crowd was large and truly diverse but orderly, no issues with security; a few kids were smoking in wait lines, and they need to have a few more large adults posted on station in the thrill ride areas. A few showers cut some ride wait times, overall, so that was welcome. Crew was professional and friendly, like all the Six Flags parks we've visited in the last couple years.",AmbleOutdoors
10,Dont bother- it is horrible!!,"I am shocked there are so many good reviews!!! This place is horrible on so many levels! First, the other visitors are just plain rude and scarey. The entrance was crawling with police and metal detectors to make sure you dont bring in any weapons. geez, what has the world come to. Once inside you understand why, put it this way- everyone looks and acts like they were once a guest on the Jerry Springer show. The employees are mostly rude teens that surely I dont trust my safety in their hands. The place is filthy and run down. The rides look unkempt and this makes me very concerned for safety. All in all, it was a horrible experience and I was sad that my kids had to see such a sad sight. Serously, if u have more than an 8th grade education, do NOT go! Head South to Disney Land, Legoland, Seaworld or even Knotts Berry Farm.",tripples
30,Dissapointed,"My last trip to six flags magic mountain was in 2001, I was really looking forward to my latest visit. However, I must say that I was very dissapointed, it seems six flags has made no attempt to up keep this park. Colossus, one of my favorite roller coasters growing up, was a shadow of its former self. They are only running one track, the paint was gone from at least half of of the coaster, and it felt jerky. At this point it looks closer to being torn down then a running roller coaster. Batman was covered in dust and spider webs, when it first opened, this attraction looked awesome, now they don't even take care to clean the Bat suit in the ride. The paint was faded an pealing on most attractions, and just general maintenance was not a priority, I could go on and on, but the park seemed in general disrepair, There also seemed to be a shortage of cleaning staff, there was puke on the ground in two different spots, but we never say anybody to tell except ride operators. The staff themselves all seemed like they wanted to be somewhere else, none seemed to happy.Magic Mountain still has some awesome Roller Coasters, X2, Tatsu, and Apocalypse really stood out, but even getting in line first thing the wait was 30 min for X2. By 11:30 I would say the wait time was 1 and 1/2 hours. We were here two days the first day we spent 4 hours in line for just X2, Tatsu, and the rapids ride. The second day we went towards Colossus, and never stood in line for more than a 1/2 hour. So, if you want the best rides go left towards x2 if you want the shortest ride times go right.There weren't any ""dark"" rides, theming (with the exception of Batman, Apocalypse and Green Lantern), or shows to speak of,so the experience of Magic Mountain is limited to the Coasters themselves. If you don't love fast roller coasters, Magic mountain is probably not worth visiting.",summertravel999
10,VERY BAD EXPERIENCE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"We'll see if this actually makes it to the post, so here we go. Yesterday was my B-day (7-12) and my girlfriend of 3 years bought me tickets to go to six flags magic mountain for the day. Well we drove 2 hours, mind you my girlfriend is treated for anxiety with Medical Marijuana and medicated before we left 2 hours prior to arriving at the park. Get to the gates with security. After security searched her bag 4-5 times they called over a supervisor and a sheriff to search her bag. After doing so and still finding nothing they informed us that we had to leave the park because her bag smelled like marijuana and she admitted to smoking a joint two hours prior to arriving at the park. They told her she wouldnt be able to go on the rides being medicated. She has her medical card and this is the treatment she chose. Instead of taking Xanax or whatever other medication they give to people with anxiety. But people high on Xanax are perfectly welcome because Hey Xanax has no smell. Get real people. This is Discrimination and it violates California civil codes and access laws. Also violates CDPA. I am outraged and I will let the world know six flags discriminates against persons with disabilities.",Eric P
50,Great Fun,A great park with some fantastic rides. One or two rides were closed due to the weather being a bit damp but that couldn't be helped. Still plenty of things to do and a great family day out.,Greg S
40,Kids had a blast!,"I'll be honest, I wasn't as excited to go to Six Flags as my husband and two kids (age 10 & 7). Especially after reading some of the negative reviews here on TripAdvisor. However, I was pleasantly surprised. I really believe we got the most for our money.Because we wanted to do the park over several days we bought a Season Pass at $61 per person. It was cheaper going that route than buying tickets for several days, plus it included a free parking pass for the entire season (it's $15 a day to park otherwise). We were also given a coupon book which had food & store coupons for the park, but the biggest surprise was a FREE pass to Hurricane Harbor in each book. The whole family was able to get into the water park for free which was a bonus since we hadn't planned on spending the extra amount to go.Yes, the food inside the park is very expensive, but I expected that. We were able to bring in our own sealed water bottles and snacks. They check your bags but these items were ignored. I've heard some people say they will make you throw outside food away before entering, but that never happened to us.I didn't think the park was too messy. In fact, I thought the landscaping was very nice...lots of well-kept greenery and shade (compared to Phoenix, ha ha!). The one exception was the bathrooms. I'll admit they need to be updated and cleaned more often.The best tip I could give to avoid crowds is to go after 5:30pm. The first day we went to the park was on a Tuesday evening at almost 6pm. There were literally busloads of kids leaving as we entered. There were almost no lines (even for Tatsu).Most rides are definitely for older (or taller) kids. However, my adventurous 7 year old who is 52"" tall was able to go on quite a bit (Revolution, Goliath, Colossus, Apocalypse, Ninja). My daughter went on the even crazier stuff with her Dad. The kids had an absolute blast and already want to go back.",harobubba
40,Nice visit,"First time visit for my family of 11. Ages 5-65. We all had an enjoyable day. There was plenty for all to do especially the coaster riders. Food was exspensive which it is in all the amusement parks. Highly recommend you buy the plastic drink containers that they sell at the park entrance for $12. You can get it filled as many times as you want at any of the restaurants with soda, water, lemonade, etc. Worth the money that we paid for the tickets that we bought on ebay.",jerryp
50,Great first Six Flags Experience!,"This review, like my other Six Flags review is coming late. This one moreso. I travelled here in February of 2010 as part of my California trip.Stayed in Hollywood, and drove out to Valencia (not too far, maybe an hour) to Six Flags.We did our research and bought tickets, and printed them off prior to coming to this amusement park. We saved on parking, lineups and overall total cost. Plan ahead.We were expecting huge roller coasters, and we got more than we expected. The websites show a detailed outline of all the rides and what kind of thrill rating they are. But when you actually see how huge these things are in person, its awesome.I particularly remember riding Tatsu, it's a 'flying type' rollercoaster that drops you over a mountainside. It was crazy fun. And we also got the 'FlashPass' so lineup times were minimal and allowed us to experience every ride we wanted to go on multiple times.The park is huge, and its in a mountain, so be prepared to walk and wear comfy shoes. As with most Six Flags parks, they are divided into separate areas, like 'Gotham City' featuring themed rides, like the Riddler's Revenge (also an awesome ride).I would go back to this Six Flags any day. For the thrill seeker, you will find plenty here. Be prepared to pay around 100 bucks for a full day of fun though! We spent approx 10 hours here!",AlbertaEdmontonGuy
20,See other 6 flags review,"Too many people, lines way too long, dirty messy, disgusting bathrooms and awful food.",Luanne P
40,Thrill Rides - only,"I've been coming here for several years and love that I've been able to pass down the thrill ride seeker baton to my 10 yr old. This park is definitely for older kids/teens and the young at heart who have no heart conditions because this is all about the rides. They have awesome, scary, crazy, jerky, wet, twisty, and HIGH rides. Expect to do a lot of walking and waiting. The park is situated on a hill/mountain so you may encounter some long treks up some steep concrete terrain so wear comfortable shoes. Yes, the food prices are a total rip-off and you will get thirsty and pay $4 for a small lemonade but again, you're going for the rides. Don't set your expectations too high on service either. If you like a good adrenaline rush this is the place for you. For little kids, not so much. I couldn't bear to take the little guy all day so I took him in the evening since there were only about 3 rides he could get on (36"" height requirement). He had fun but the big boys had a blast and some bruises by the end of the night from a couple of the rides.Oh yeah, take an empty 20oz Coke bottle for $25 off ticket price!",socobruja
20,Not a fan!,"Found a great deal on the entry tickest but, was little disappointed to have to pay extra to park considering it is not walking distance from anywhere. The rides were incredible, really impressed. Not at all impressed by the food in the park. Ate lunch at the Johnny Rockets which was really expensive for what you got. Two of us ordered chicken strips and was given BBQ sauce to dip them in. When I asked for Ranch dressing the lady said she would have tio charge me .80 cents. I told her to take back the BBQ sauce and give Ranch instead but, she still had to charge. The park was extremely dirty, gum on every post and poster, spit on the TV's, vomit in the bushes, and human poop at the entrance to the water ride. No, I am not kidding. A child had an accident and they were telling us to watch our step. A very small amount of the ride attendants seemed like they wanted to be there and made the best of it, most were just passing the time. Not looking to go back anytime soon which is a bummer because we really enjoyed the rides.",travelerAZ2
40,A good value after 4pm,"if you go to Six Flags Magic Mountain I recommend getting there very early or after 4 or 5pm when crowds dwindle. Best time to hit thrill rides are very first thing in morning (but you'll probably only get 1 in), during lunch around 1pm and after 7pm",travel94531
30,A little bit hit and miss,"Visited in the depths of winter in December, perhaps it feels better in the sunshine, Theme park has lost a little of its sparkle and could do with a good clean up.Theme rides where very good and my three sons enjoyed the rides, I must be getting old as some of them made me a little nervous to try!Food did not impress, but there is an excellent Red Lobster resteraunt near the entrance which is well worth a visit.It is a good idia to buy your tickets on line in advance, great saveings to be made.",LewisCox50
30,Wish i could give it more...,"I expected more to be honest. All the rides are the same, roller coasters that spin you upside down multiple times, smashing your head off the over the shoulder straps as it goes.The food is rubbish, and so expensive, and the toilets are filthyX2, the new ride is AMAZING, and is different from any coaster ive ever been on, and green lantern too, its cool and just different from all the other stuff that is the same in the park.Its ok if your at a loose end, but no better than a UK theme park, universal studios is much better",Andy17898
20,Rides are Great but service is lacking,"spent the weekend in LA first at Disneyland then at Magic Mountain. First I know it is not fair to compare any other part to disney and I will not here. but I have been to other 6 flags. I wasvery disaponted in the park overall first the bathrooms were horrible the smell of urine was unbeliveable and trash on the floors. It looked like no one had been in to clean it up in days.Next food. I just wanted a hamburger after a search on the map found a hamber place and after walkeng up a large hill found it got there a huge line took 30 minutes to just get to order the food was fin but to get it to the table was not no trays, not lids for the drinks no one to help carry items not customer friendly. Next the rides no complants super rides X2 and Tatsui were so fun. What hurt this experience was the line wait 1hour plus for both rides. whe arriveing at the front of the lines found coaster cars going with almost a 1/4 of the seats empty. No excuse with that many people waiting. Also very slow loading the cars. 25% time wasted in line for no real good reason.Six Flags needs and ride line expert to fix this problem. I was there 6 hours and only rode 3 rides.not a good experience.",jpayne11
30,Meh.,"I did not love this place as much as I expected. Yes, there are tons of great roller coasters, but everything was crazy expensive (ie. $17.00 for four cokes), the lineups for most of the rides were incredibly long, and none of the staff we encountered were very friendly or helpful - just doing their jobs and nothing more. Also, I waited 15 minutes in a line just to use one of the restrooms to find that it was completely filthy. This place is definitely geared more towards older kids and adults. If you DO go here, make sure to buy the refillable souvenir cup. You get free refills the day you buy it (we didn't find out about this offer until the third time we bought a drink).",ElvisPugsleyOttawa
50,Superb,"Visited from UK in December 2011. Drove up from Anaheim for the day. We had a Go LA card which we used one day's admission to get into Six Flags. Rides were superb. Had read / looked at them before going so knew what to expect. Been to several theme parks (Universal, Busch Gdns, PortAventura, Alton Towers, Thorpe Park, Disney in Paris, Orlando & Anaheim) but the rides here are bigger, faster, more extreme than any of those places. Went on X2 first, as had seen video footage of it on youtube. My 7 year old daughter was just tall enough to ride and someone in the queue behind remarked ""have you seen that little girl going on, she's brave"". Best coaster I have been on. Unfortunately, she was just too small to go on Viper, Batman, Scream etc so just me & my 11 year old daughter went on those, while my younger daughter stayed with her Mum. We all went on Goliath, Apocolypse and Green Lantern, which is a very deceiving ride.........looks nothing before you go on, but got one hell of a kick to it. My youngest and me also went on Superman, eldest didnt fancy it.Didnt get to go on Riddlers Revenge or Tatsu, and I was a bit gutted about missing out on Tatsu. First time I went to go on and it had broken down, second time it had been fixed but queue wasnt worth waiting for and decided to do couple of other coasters which didnt have queues. Shame park wasnt open longer. This was a Sunday (11th December 2011) and understand it only opens Saturdays & Sundays during this time of year (up until Xmas hols).Didint buy a flash pass. Got talking to a local American family who said we shouldnt bother as they thought it would be a quiet day, and they were right. Apart from about a 25 minute wait for X2, I dont think we waited more than 10 minutes for any ride (Tatsu aside due to technical problems) and we walked straight on Batman, Goliath, Ninja, Colossus, Revolucion, Viper, Apocolypse and Scream (Scream on front row too). Small queues for Superman & Green Lantern. I can see how flash passes might be a good idea in the height of season though.Overall, superb park, superb rides. If you visit when quiet then you will have a great time.",rokerzammo1970
50,Get a flash pass!,"Awsome roller coaster rides! Dont do all the best ones first tho or the others will not impress as the day goes on. Save online by purchasing a ticket a few days out for about $35 and spend the extra on a gold flash pass. We went on a summer day midweek. Most lines were 1+ hour long but with the flash pass we pretty much went straight to the front of the que. The gold pass strictly speaking just cut our wait time to about 20minutes from booking a ride but by the time you complete one ride and walk to the next the time is up and you walk straight to the front. Im not sure we would have got all the rides done without it. It also gets cheaper the larger your group is.The park was not as flash as Disney land but appeared clean an tidy with a good crowd. X2 is the best ride in my opinion but save it to the end or nothing else will compare. However big the que, its worth the wait!",keeweeboy
40,great roller coastes,...if roller coasters are your thing....go!.....try to go on off nights however....the lines on busy days are ENORMOUS,Jerry C
40,One of our children's playground,Our family has the annual passes and the parking pass. We get our money's worth. The kids love coming here for 2-4 hours whenever it fits our schedule. It's within 20 minutes of our home. Sometimes we meet our friends there for a playdate. Our kids play in the Bugs Bunny World and also like the jet stream ride and bumper cars. Fun place for kids and inexpensive for the parents. We enjoy our time with them there.,TTITL
50,"We use to the Flash Pass. And it was a great success. Lots of rides for roller coaster fans, not so much to do for younger kids.","We went with a family of 7 and if you use your Discover card to pay for tickets, you get 5% off, plus you can get in a much shorter line for entrance into the park. Pay online at least 4 days ahead of time to get a great ticket price ($35 each). We paid for a Gold Flash Pass for 4 of us (who were the rollercoaster goers) for $50 more per person, and it cut the wait time for rides by about 90 percent which was excellent. It allowed us to get out of the hot sun in line, and see other things in the park and go on more rides. We traded off the Flash Pass to the other 3 people in our group to use it as well, which was a great way to save money, and it turned out to be a good value, since we only had 1 day at the park. I would suggest going on a week day, getting the flash pass, and getting there before the park opens for a fast entrance, and fewer lines in the beginning. If you have a Discover card, use that to pay for tickets online, you get in a bit early and also save 5 percent on everything in the park. They do not allow you to bring in food or water or beverages, but if you buy a Souvenir Cup, which is 16 dollars for 1 (but if you by 3 its only $ 9.99 each), then refills on soda, drinks and water are free all day. This means for all hydration we spent $30 ( for 3 souvenier cups) for all drinks (and split them between the 7 of us) and we stayed there 12 hours. This is about $4 per person for all you can drink, which I think was a bargain. There are a few rides for is a very small crowd 5 and under, tons of coasters for thrillseekers, but not too many rides for people that are looking for something in between.",CandCandC
50,Six Flags Magic Mountain,"After falling in love with big rollercoasters at Busch Gardens Willamsburg , i had to come here. This park is amazing! The coasters were all fantastic. Tatsu, Riddlers Revenge, and Scream! were my favorite favorite coasters there. Magic Mountain has a wide assortment of coasters from standing to multi dimension to flying. The park was also very clean and organized I would definitely recommend this park to any coaster enthusiasts or thrill seekers.",Ryan R
40,Six Flage is not just for kids!!,Great fun - eeven for couples in their 50's....as long as you don't mind travelling upside down and inside out..!!!!Big tip is go for a Fast Pass - well worth it if you don't want to queue for hours.,Richard O'C
50,FRICKIN AWESOME!!!!!!,"I went here in 2005. Was so much fun! I never wanted to leave.I've never been on such massive, scary and exciting rollercoasters before (mind you, I'm from New Zealand. The only roller coaster we have is at Rainbows End and it sucks!)I can't wait to go back oneday. It was one of the funnest days of my life (apart from the sweaty heat, the walking, and queing)I wish they had a VIP pass or something, I would totally pay lots of money for that.",rachyrach83
40,Great fun for older kids and adults,"Not a whole lot of family-type rides but the coasters are amazing! We didn't pay extra to get flash passes but if you do the coasters when they first open, the lines aren't too bad. I wish they would enforce the ""line behavior"" however. There was a lot of cursing and smoking in lines. Also, park employees are not as friendly and helpful as they should be.",Cami C
50,"X2 was awesome, Flashpass was worth the cost!!","My 15 year-old nephew and I spent 6/17 at Six Flags and we had a wonderful time. We got the platinum Flashpass and while it was expensive at $187, it was well worth it. We felt like VIP's with front of the line privileges and being able to ride twice each time. We rode 28 rides and were blown away by X2, it was the best!!!",parisienfoodisgood
30,1st trip to California,"My son and I went to the Six Flags in Valencia California. We upgraded to the platinum flash pass to avoid the lines and this was great. We also upgraded for the X2 and green lantern ride. However, the upgrade only give us one ride with the fast pass. For all the money we paid, I think we should have been able to ride all the rides as many times as we wanted. The fast pass only works on certain rides that day. Oh and the new ride was not yet open....disappointed.",Danielle H
50,Our Magical Trip to Magic Mountian,"My youngest daughter is finally old enough to enjoy Magic Mountian so we made the trip. We went June 8th and it was perfect. Many school in California are not out yet so the park was not at all crowded. We arrived 10 minutes prior to the park opening and got right on several of the most popular rides including X2, Revolution, Viper, Riddlers Revenge, and Batman. We rode every single ride before 2:00 and then started over. The longest we had to wait was 25 minutes in the afternoon. The food in the park is so so...they do have a Panda Express but we brought in a back pack with bottled water, beef jerkey, fresh fruit along with first aid supplies and tylenol (always a mom)and no one said anything.The park is clean, not as clean as Disney but than neither is my house....The weather is amazing this time of year it was prefect weather in the mid to high 60's. We were there from open to close and had a blast. Helpful hint - wear comfortable tennis shoes and don't carry anything in your pockets. Bring a backpack rather than a purse, most of the rides have lockers or cubbies to stow your things while you ride.There are water rides... ride those around 2:00 when its the warmest or last. Bring towels and/or change of clothes. They are fun but cold",TravelingMomAZ777
40,Spring Break with my nephew,"My nephew is from Honolulu,Hawaii he came and visit us here in the State of California for Spring break and we decided to take him to the Six Flags Magic Mountain it was a good experience with him and wants to return again on his next vacation here..",DOLLY M
50,Awesome roller coasters!,"The park is nothing special but the roller coasters are awesome!!The park could use some better upkeep and clean up because in some areas it looks old or dirty.But what matters are the coasters! Awesome roller coasters of all different kinds! Not 2 are alike and there are some that will definitly push you to the limit. And in addition if you want to take a break there is a really fun area full of cheaply price carnival games.My friends and I enjoy the food, the burgers and the BBQ place are actually pretty good although a little expensive, there is also a panda express which is nice.Tip: if you are ridig X2, ride it at night, it definitly will enhance your experience.",xsv_66
50,Loved it,"it was so much fun, even though it is a little bit expensive, but still you have a life of your life. I really recommend going on weekdays as weekends are soooo busy. If it is busy it is totally worth getting platinum card to go on everything without staying in the line",Saeideh R
40,What type are you?!,"Six Flags Magic Mountain rocks! The X2 ride is totally amazing and cannot be missed! My husband and I have done sky diving before and even this ride is even scarier. The way you dangle in the air and turn around makes it real. Goliath was also very fun with the long steep curve it took. The flash pass was worth it if you didn't want to wait at all but unfortunate that for the amount you pay for the flash pass, some of the good rides (X2, Green lantern, etc) are not included and still have to pay more to add those rides in. Also, unlike disney, you do not need to go to that ride to get a flash pass, you are given this small round pager and you can view all the waiting times and select which is the next ride you want to reserve. Definitely worth a visit!",Serenut
30,Where has the magic gone?,Magic Mountain is not the same anymore...or perhaps it's just that i am an older not so young man anymore...ahahhah. Try it out if you have not...but I won't be going unless a nephew or niece of mine insist.,Rey L
50,Roller Coaster Kingdom!!,"Roller Coaster Kingdom!! The key to having the opportunity to ride ALL the rides is to go “off season”. We visited during the week in May. The park was clean and with plenty of helpful employees and the longest line was about 25 minutes. I suggest you also ride the classic Colossus and Montezuma Revenge and go up & down history lane to be able to compare them to the modern roller coasters. If you go off season you will have plenty of time to ride the large roller coaster, and the small joy rides such as bumper cars, etc. too. If you are in a budget I suggest you take in a non-disposable water bottle (only thing allowed in) refill at drinking fountains, although I was never denied water & ice from food vendors. Don’t take a purse or backpack, most rides won’t let you ride with them and you risk getting them stolen if you leave them on the side. For lunch/dinner you might want to call ahead and check if they allow people to go out and back in and eat out of an ice chest because food is super expensive. Suggestion for “water rides” - takes extra clothes, ride all the “water rides” first, change into dry clothing and then enjoy the rest of the park (avoid chaffing and cold, MM is at a higher elevation and it gets cold). There are lockers available, but they are also expensive, so change when you go to your car for lunch. They have wheelchair access all through the park, but I don’t suggest taking elderly or children under 43 inches tall; personally I think this amusement park is too expensive for someone who will not ride the large roller coasters and if you don’t move fast from one ride to the next you’ll need 3 days to visit the whole park. They do have an area for “thrill seekers in training” which could be visited in 2-3 hours. Tickets are around $60, parking $15, water bottles $3.50, lunch about $22.",MissHernandez
50,this is for trill seekers,"i had so much fun with my friends and family it's perfect for trill seekers, there's even rides for small children not everything is roaler coasters. next to it they have a seperate park hurricane harbor thats also awesome. i bought my yearly season pass for both parks so far i have only gone in april i need to make plans for next month.",cawa76025
50,Awesome!,"We were gonna buy the tickets at the Six Flags but we found out that online was way cheaper. So, first of all, get your tickets online :)It was only a friend and I. We spent the day at Six Flags, on a Sunday, so it was not very crowded, we were in the front row of all rides. If you get a map as soon as you get into the Park, you won't have problems going around and finding the attractions.The rollercoasters are nothing like I've ever seen before. They are all so different and amazing. It amazed me, because I'm used to go to parks and rollercoaster all over the us, and I was impressed by those.The only thing that I didn't like was that all food places closes 2 hours before the park closes. I was hungry and had nothing to eat.",PriscillaCruz
40,AAA private members party was great deal,"I always wonder why there are about 5 actual police squad cars parked out front in the afternoon/evening. I have heard there is trouble with LA gangs. We went during the Auto Club private members party & decided that is the only time to go. Otherwise, be sure to get in line before it opens & stay until about 1 pm and leave. Then you can get on rides and the people in the park are more tolerable. Avoid the Green Lantern ride, it gets off balance all the time & you may waste all your time stuck in a line you can't get out of. It isn't worth it.",Nancy W
50,Great day out,"We spent the day at Six flags back in April, the weather was perfect and the park was quiet. We had paid for the flash passes which we used later in the day as the park did get busy. Its very clean and easy to get around.I read a few reviews about the lockers, having to pay before you get onto the rides to store your bags. I did this once but then noticed that everyone just left them at the side of the ride. I did this for the whole day along with everyone else and there was no issue.The rides are great so much bigger and better than anything in England.We had a great day out and would recommend this to our friends and family.",Deg24
50,"Have been here multiple times, and enjoy coming back every time!","I have been to Magic Mountain a couple of times. With every trip I enjoy it more and more. Each time we go we learn more of the do's and don'ts of the park. The first ride that is an absolute must is X2. We always go directly to this line as soon as the park opens and this gets us the shortest line for that particular ride. I enjoy almost every ride at this park, with the exception of tatsu. There is something about being in the superman position and coming back to reality that just makes my stomach turn. We were at the park on the Friday of memorial day weekend, and there actually weren't that many people. We did every roller coaster that we wanted to get on and left the park by 6 PM. Yes the food and souvenirs can be expensive in the park but that is to be expected and is the same at every theme park you are going to encounter. I thought that the park looked nice and was well kept up. I love coming here and will continue to come back.",lesliea277
50,"Go Platinum, especially on a Saturday","Went to the Park on Friday and Saturday. Friday was ALOT less people, but Saturday was super crowded. We opted for the Platinum Flash Pass and for a family of 3 it was an extra $269 on top of the park admission.",SunnyInUtah
10,Lacking in many areas,"The theme park told one story - lack of money/investment.- There were not enough staff on keeping an eye on the place and tidying/cleaning- There was no control at the rides preventing the gangs of teenagers jumping the line to join their mates nearer the front.- Most rides only had one car working accentuating the wait in queues worsened by fast passes bringing the queues to a complete halt for lengthy times. It's worth mentioning that this was a Wednesday outside of school holidays.- There were not enough signage/information to tell you what rides were working and directions to entrances.- Some of the gangs of teenagers were just too much, i.e. in your face when you are in line and just frankly intimidating.- The merchandise was seriously overpriced, as were the drink and food.We came away feeling that the only thing we deserved from this visit was a refund which is a very disappointing thing to say when every day of a holiday is precious. I cannot recommend this to anyone as it seems the teenagers have the run of the place along with lack of making the park look clean. There are plenty of nicer places to go and spend your money in California.",Loopy1970
40,"Coasters, Coasters and more Coasters!","Magic Mountain is great for those who love thrill rides and high speed roller coasters, as it has some of the best and heart-stopping coasters in the world. However, don't expect an ambiance like you would find at Disneyland. There isn't a lot of money put into the grounds and landscaping, etc. It definitely appears as though the majority of their budget is put into the construction and maintenance of their rides.",Desiree M
40,Good Value Fun - Could Use Some Mid-Range Rides!,"We are annual pass-holders but live 1.5 hours away so we don't go a whole lot. However, getting the pass is totally worth it if you get them early in the year and buy 4 (to get free parking). We also really enjoy Hurricane Harbor and will be planning some trips in the summer. I am on the SFMM survey list and I come down to saying the same thing every time...they have a lot of rides and fun things for little kids...then they have the INTENSE roller coasters but there is very little in between. Colossus is dwarfed now and is fun but is getting really run down...there is hardly ever a line for it. The water rides are mild but if you don't feel like getting wet then there really isn't much there other than the big coasters. Don't get me wrong...I do love coasters but even at 45 my neck can't handle being whipped upside down, so I stay away from those. Also, with a 7 year old there aren't too many rides that we all like together. Strangely, Apocalypse has become one of our favorites...even the fact that there is some ""scenery"" to go along with it. I keep telling them they should ""think Disneyland"" for planning some new rides for families to enjoy. We normally arrive at an ""early lunch"" and eat a filling meal at Wendy's (I'm partial to the chili and baked potato) THEN go into the park with a full belly. They don't want you bringing in food but I always have fruit snacks and vitamin waters and they have never had a problem with that. We use the $1 off coupon from the annual pass book to get the popcorn bucket which refills for 99 cents. Then we head out to have dinner elsewhere. We did notice a pretty good-looking outdoor barbecue there that we have missed previously...burgers and turkey legs. I'm betting that it's $$$ but it looked and smelled good! OH, and I should have said this up-front...this is a WALKING park and they don't call it Magic MOUNTAIN for nothing. If you can't handle a lot of walking and/or hills, this place isn't for you. There is no way to get around the park without hoofing it and it's a LOT of hoofing. Your kids will be exhausted and you'll be working off that turkey leg. Have fun!!",ClawMarks
50,Love six flags,Hate the long lines but love six flags they should have more donation days those are always awesome times to go =],Pinky143xoxo
40,"Great fun, cheap entry but expensive once in.","Six flags is great fun. If you like white knuckle rides you're in for a treat. Although entry to the park is very cheap in comparison to other similar attractions in L.A, it's once you're in the park where they make their money. Food and drink is very expensive. I'm not sure if you're allowed to take your own refreshments into the park.That is my only complaint though. Everything else is great. I went a couple of weeks ago so the American school kids were'nt on holiday. This meant the park was very quiet. The longest I had to wait to get on a ride was 5 minutes.All in all a great day out.",Dterry182
40,Consistently Good,"Six Flags Magic Mountain is very consistent - rides, cleanliness, and overall park experience is about the same every time I go. I went in May and there were no lines for rides (except X2 and Tatsu). Had the all you can eat buffet for lunch. At $20, I would have expected more than salad, beef, chicken and some starchy sides but I can't complain because I checked it out before I bought it. I was hungry and it filled me up, so mission completed. The food quality was cafeteria level, but it's about what I expect from a theme park restaurant since my expectations were pretty low to begin with.Season pass people were ""adequately friendly"". They did their job quickly with very little small talk or welcoming demeanor even though we were the only ones in there. More smiles would have been nice, but hey, I got my pass and didn't have to wait in line so that's cool.Only real complaint was that there were no shows or other entertainment and too many rides were closed. I get it...I went in May and it isn't as busy as the summer months, but it would have been nice to ride all the rides and check out some other entertainment.Overall, it was about what I expected and I had fun.",David B
40,Six flags fun,"I took my kids on New Years day to Six Flags Magic Mountain in Valencia. We had a great time, the lines weren't long and the park wasn't crowded. The food is ok at best, Way over priced but that is to be expected at any theme park. We discussed making this an annual trip since we did have a good time. I just can't wait till they get the new rides built.",jayne916
50,Great Day!!,"First of all, go to the website and buy your tickets (for half price!) and parking online before you go to the park. By doing this, you get to walk past all the other suckers waiting in line and get into the park with no wait time. We went on a Friday, and it wasn't too terribly busy. The only time we had to wait in a line for a ride was for bumper cars, which was 5 minutes at the most. ALL of the other rides had absolutely no wait time. Our favorite ride was the Apocalypse, you MUST go on it! We were hesitant at first, but ended up going on it 3 times. Other 'musts' are all of the water rides (if you don't mind getting soaking wet!) and the old wooden roller coaster called Colossus. One warning though; there are hills and hills and hills that you will inevitably end up going up and down at least 3 times.",Kat S
50,It's still the BEST!,"Go and ride the X2 first (I employed the suggestion of another reviewer and ran straight from the gate). Then pick up your ""flash Pass"" (I got the gold one). Then ride Tatsu. The food is expensive, the smoking areas were clearly marked but a bit small, the gift and merchandise shops were well stocked. I saw no marauding teenagers or gang activity. Its still all good at Magic Mountain! Oh yeah, my 16 year old daughter was getting tired and said ""geeze mom, this place is very hilly..."" so I had to respond ""It's not named Magic Field hun..""",Jebvixxen
40,"Terrific new coasters,but looking a bit tired.","Went with my son for the day on his birthday,we are experienced coaster junkies and 1st time at six flags.We firstly got Platinum fast passes,recommended by many advisors.They did give us front access straight away and we didn't queue all day,though it was quiet.The X2 coaster was 1st,absolutely fantastic.Unfortunately even if you have the platinum pass you have to pay extra to fast pass the X2 which is ridiculous.Also the Green lantern.Although the main thrill rides and to be honest the older rides are great,the park looked like it needs a liven up,there was no atmosphere or excitement apparent I know its not Universal but to attract people these days a bit of showbiz is required.Also the food is so over priced,$8.99 for a slice of pizza?come on.",Galaxie64Chester
50,Weekday fun,"Went on the spur of the moment on a Wed afternoon. The best 6 flaggs experience I ever had was able to hit ever ""thrill"" ride 2 x in a4 hr period. No lines. Staff was limited but for the lack of lines I'll take the lack of service. X2 and Tatsu were amazing rides and I am a roller coaster junkie. Everything is VERY expensive and park is built on a mountian so plan to walk a lot of hills.",Scott C
30,Great time but a lot of closed rides!,"Great coaster park, especially the X2. Too bad a few coasters were closed. My highlight would have been Superman of it wasnt out of order due the construction of a new ride.",Voortmen
40,Amazing!,This park is amazing! We went during spring time and there were no lines! The only issue was we were staying in downtown LA and it was a pain trying to get transport to Six Flags.,sdd5
40,"Great rides, big lines big prices","We were there on long weekend and the lines were very big. 3h+ for some rides. The flashpass system is not very convinient. You get special devices on which you can book ride times, however not all rides are available to book and you have to pay extra for single ride on X2 and Green Lantern. Platinum pass for 2 pople + tickets is about $300 - and you still have to wait in line about 20 min for every ride!Rides are great and there are a lot of them! however the park itself is very shaby.The Green Lantern kept breaking down the whole day: we've spent hour and a half in line (with platinum passes) - listening that ride have minor issues and will be reopened in about 10 minutes. After that it was anounced that issues will take longer. We left in line, but the ride was never closed and people were still waiting in line and getting stuck on the ride every other time.The food is also not very good.Overall - come for the great rides, take platinum passes because otherwise you won't have enough time to visit what you want.",kosenko
50,Awesome rides!!!,There is nothing to hate at Magic Mountain! Everything is great and fun! I would recommend the youngest age to come is 10. Nothing younger so they can ride them all! Great amusement park and cannot wait to go back soon!,dbackslover5
50,Weekday in early May is a great time to go - don't pay for a Flash Pass,We traveled on a Thursday in the first week of May to this park. If your visiting the park on a weekday in the Spring before the kids are out of school I think you can safely avoid the Flash Pass. We literally walked right on to half the coasters. We were actually able to ride consecutive times on Goliath and Apocalypse as they literally had no lines. The longest lines were at X2 and Tatsu. But even those were only about 15 minutes. I think once we waited 30 minutes for X2. We got to the park 15 minutes before the gates opened and had rode most major rides once by about 2 PM. The park was busiest at about 3 - 5 PM. The Flash Pass would probably be worth it in the summer when there are huge lines. But a weekday during the school year is a great time to go. The park was very clean and the staff was enthusiastic. The parking lot looked like it was about 15% full.,Lucas C
40,"Awesome Rides, less than friendly staff","This is a ""Mecca"" for thrill ride seekers for good reason. Not a single ride let us down. One favorite was ""Colossas"", the roller coaster made famous by National Lampoon's Vacation in 1981.We purchased the Platinum Flash Pass to get the most out of our single day at the park. This was money well spent. It made the lines very short (from zero wait to 20 minutes max) and allowed us to ride twice without even getting out of our seats! The only downsides were that the passes did not work on the two newest rides: X-2 and Green Lantern.As far as the staff goes, we may be too used to the Disney level of service. These workers are a lower caliber and not very friendly. They made my wife carry her purse on the river raft ride. It would have been super easy to just let her leave it by the exit like ALL of the other rides. But no, instead we had to carry it and move it around the raft like a hot potatoe to keep it away from the waves!!!",kkkjbj
50,Tons of Thrill Rides!,"In the summer, go later in the afternoon in the middle of the week, when the crowd starts to dwindle and you avoid the heat, because the area gets much hotter than the regular Los Angeles area. In the winter, go on Superbowl Sunday when there are no crowds, because most people are at home watching the game.",Ralph K
50,Cannot complain,"I have been to Six Flags a few times over the years and I still think this is one of the best theme parks I have ever been to, puts UK ones to shame!!I love the food too, yes it's expensive, but you're in a theme park! You have to try the chicken strips!",Emma C
40,Yay!! hangin upside down,"OK this is gonna be a LONG review. I think this park is great if you go at the right time. Don't come in the summer as it is HOTTT and super busy and you will be cranky,sweaty,smelly. It is best during the off season even though it closes earlier but, sometimes a few rides will be down for maintence. If you get a season pass you need to get to park earlier than opening time as you will have to wait in a processing area before you can even get into park. Same thing goes if you have pets to board in the kennel as sometimes there is noone there and you have to wait for them to arrive so make sure you have guest relations programmed in your cell otherwise you may have to drive all the way back to tell someone you need assistance. The kennel is very small and rundown. There is one outside kennel that is about the size of a standard door. All others are like tiny little cages stacked on eachother. If you get thru turnstiles when park opens everyone will run to X2 which is usually a good idea. Your wait will be about 20-45 min rather than 2 hours depending if you run or walk. Besides the rides which are great, there isn't much else to do. Lines can be very long so if you only have one day a flash pass might be helpful. Flash pass has 3 levels to which the price goes up based on level. I have only purchased the standard. It works well. You basically pick a ride on this beeper and go ride something with a short line and then it will tell you you have 10 min to get to ride you have reserved. As soon as you are greeted by Six Flags Employee and they bump your beeper with thier beeper, you are clear to request new ride. You will have to wait in a smaller line and usually by the time you are done with ride you can walk right over to other ride. Other than that DO NOT bring purses,backpack. Only bring what you can strap to yourself or put in zippered pockets. It does not matter how small the purse is they will make you pay a $1 to put in a locker which adds up as the lockers are at each major ride. Get water bottle clips to clip to your shorts if you don't want to carry it. Wear good shoes, no flip flops,heels and no skirts (common sense people). Bring sunscreen and keep hydrated. The bathrooms are few and not always clean so just don't be suprised. There are alot of teenagers cursing,making out and cutting in line so go when school is still in session and no 3 day weekends cuz everyone will be there. Check the Six Flags calender to make sure your visit doesn't land on a event at the park as that will make it busier too and you won't go on Gay Pride day if you are sensitive to that. You will also be required to go thru metal detector and all purses/bags will be inspected so don't try to sneak food/weapons/drinks in. I think they will sometimes let some food slide if you have a baby but, depends on who does checking. I would just bring water and Crystal Lite packets you can stash in your pants if you want flavor. You can leave once with a stamp during your visit if you wanna stock a cooler in your car with sandwiches/food/soda if want to save money on food. You could leave park to eat and come back but, then who knows where you will get parked at upon return. The walk to entrance is kind of far no matter where you park. The rides are awesome and alot of fun if you plan it out right.",chinchila
30,Want a thrill ride...this is the place!,"Overall the park was fun.. I think the park really need to implement some organization upon entering the park. We arrived about 40 mins early and there was a mass of people waiting for the gates to open...when the gates did open..people were all trying to go in at the same time instead of having formed lines so entrance would be easier. I know theme parks are a bit more costly than other places but damn 3.75 for a 20oz bottle of water is crazy to me. The flash passes are ridiculous priced..and the set-up of these pases make no sense to me! I've visited other parks and purchased passes that was more detailed..regular, gold, platinum passes just don't make much sense to me but people were in line to purchase.. I think with some implementation and revamping this could be better than an OK park. For the rides we did have an opportunity to ride--can you say definitely thrill rides..much fun...we didn't get to ride as many as we expected because of the lengthy lines...Not sure if this is a spot we will visit again!!Overall we did have a good time!",Karena_Jax01

40,Want Big Thrills this i sthe place for you.- be warned Superman still under construction until summer 2012.,"I spent a great day with my teenage daughter and her friend. Its only a short ride (depending on traffic on those dreaded LA freeways) We set off from Santa Monica Beach around 10am and it took 45 minutes tops. The return trip even quicker.We actualy got on our first ride approx 1 hour after the park opening. GOLIATH! a monster 255ft high coaster and it didnt let us down! We also walked straight onto our next ride, Collosus followed by SCREAM, again no lines (queues for us english!) This was great for getting through the rides but for me personally after a large breakfast Scream proved a little too much :-(. I felt slightly sick so left the nexy few rides to the Girls.Only dissapointment for me was that the superman ride, which I really wanted to ride. They are basically adding to the vertical coaster ride by attaching what looks very much like a massive version of say tower of terror taking you up 400ft! and dropping you vertically at 85mph. Its going to be very frightening going up as just looking at the sructure as we climbed Golliath gave me goose bumps as its another 145ft higher!We managed to ride most of the major rides all bar Tuitsi (sorry if misspelt typing after getting home now been awake 30+ hours) and X2 due to the long lines, some were 90 mins! I know people wait longer but for me anything more than 60 mins is too much.Dont waste your time on Ninja very poor.As with most parks food expensive for 3 people basic chicken tenders, fries and drink over 52 dollars!Good points are...If you get there early and try to get on big rides first you wont line up for too long after say 1pm lines start getting 45 mins to 90 mins and this was on a week day. Ok it was spring break but i think most of the local schools were back ( most seemed to be there on day trips!)Its a must for big thrill rides and although it is pretty hilly walking distances between rides as not too bad and somewhat better than say Alton Towers in UK whre you have to walk for miles to each themed area.Bad points..The park didnt warn about which rides were closed and as well as the Superman there were others that were still shown on the park map that were no longer there! The park directions are also a little diffcult to follow.If you have a somewhat weak stomach youre not gonna like most of the rides as the majority have loops , twists turns, spins etc only a couple are plain coasters.HINT- Ensure you check online we saved 50% as opposed to buying at the park. Our tickets from memory were around 36$ each plus a hansome $15 to park!",davidmlowe
40,Roller Coaster Heaven,"We took our teenagers to Magic Mountain and they loved the roller coasters. I used to go there regularly when I was young and though it's grown and changed over the years, the thrills are still the same. One thing I think is a bit of nickel and diming on the part of Six Flags is their Flash Pass system. Magic Mountain is trying to emulate Disney's Fast Pass, but their system is not nearly as sophisticated or anywhere near the level of Disney's. While Disney's Fast Pass is free, Six Flags charges for their Flash Pass and in the case of their regular flash pass, it doesn't even decrease the time you wait for a ride. It just lets wander around instead of actually standing in line. Not worth $75 in my opinion. The gold and platinum levels are really outrageously priced. As if they haven't charged enough for admission and parking. Disneyland's system is much better.",Lynn F

40,Lots of speed and fun!,"Six flags offers a multiple number of rollercoasters of top quality, you will never get bored. They have a system called flashpass which enables you to get in front of the line. This is highly recommended or else you will use hours just standing in line. The flashpass will be an extra fee, but its totally worth it. Be aware that there is three different types of flashpasses and the most basic ones does not include all the rollercoasters (they can be added individualy or you can choose a more expensive flashpass). Six flags is highly recommended and offers lots of fun! Tatsu and x2 is some of the best rollercoasters. Superman was closed.",matssandvoll

30,Frustrating Day,"When the park opened at 10:30am, the rides were still being tested. We waited in line for a half hour before the first coaster opened. They ran only one train per coaster, so even though it was a light attendance day we were only able to ride 13 coasters (each a single time) over the course of 7 1/2 hours. The bulk of our time was spent waiting in lines. We spoke to a ride operator about the situation and she stated that she had been getting complaints all day but there was nothing she could do about it - it was mandated by management. It seems that Six Flags management still does not care to cater to their customers.We ate at the Mooseburger Lodge. Food was decent for park food, and the server was extremely friendly and helpful. We thought we would get a treat on the way out, but all of the food stands closed at least 1/2 hour before the park closed.Will not be back.",coffeegirl9

40,Be aware of the Viper!,"So my husband & I haven't been to Magic Mountain since we were kids. While taking a trip down to LA for my bday, we decided to add it to our list of vacation activities.First of all, if you're going to go, get your ticket online. I saved $20 each ticket by doing that.Secondly, if you haven't been there in a while be aware that it's a LONG walk from the parking lot to the main entrance. And since the park is HUGE, you will definitely be doing plenty of walking while you are there so save your feet. There is a rotating trolly that picks up and drops off closer to the parking areas. We didn't know that when we got there but realized when we were leaving and took advantage of it going back to the car. If you want to take it to the main entrance from the parking lot, simply go straight to the fence and wait by one of the letters/numbers (I can't remember which one it is) along the fence and a trolly will be by to take you to the gate.Third, there is TONS of stuff to do here. I honestly don't remember very much of this place from my childhood but it's definitely a fun place for all ages. Especially for those that don't have kids (like me) and didn't want to pay for the ""disney"" experience but wanted to enjoy some good rides.That being said, we started with the X2 ride. I am not the biggest thrill rider but I like the excitement of rides. This one was SPECTACULAR!! The way it twisted & turned along with the way you were facing was awesome. I cannot say enough good things about! Then we went next door to the Viper. THE WORST RIDE!! We were there on a Sunday in February, hence no long lines. But this ride had literally NO ONE in line. We thought it was great, went right to our seats and locked ourselves in. BAD IDEA! It is SO shaky and your head hits the sides of the chest locking system so much that it literally ruined the rest of the day for my husband & I. My ears hurt from being slammed against the chest guard and my head hurt from the constant jerking throughout the whole ride. From start to finish I just wanted to get the heck off. And after the ride we both had such extreme migraines that we just walked through the rest of the part & went home. Thank god for the great experience on the first ride or we would have hated the entire day there. We wanted to go on a couple of other rides but just couldn't handle it :(I would defintiely go back again, but stay far away from the Viper next time!!",cmleczko
40,The place was stacked!,"The plan was to be there by opening to take advantage of the day, however, we arrived 2 hours after opening and the lines were already full. In 8 hours, we rode 4 rides.

Then squeeze in what you can before closing.",BandC738
40,"Ultimate in fun, food is ridiculously priced, some attractions cost extra (way too expensive!)","Check their website for ticket deals, we found that purchasing annual passes gave us free parking as well which turned out to be a better price than just paying for a one time visit. Hopefully we'll get to use the pass for another trip before the year is up! Great fun for everyone. We were very dissapointed at the price of the food and we had a horrible experience getting our food also. Not that I expected a 5 star restraunt but it tasted horrible! Some of the attractions cost extra and are VERY expensive. Just to drive the go carts cost extra and weren't that fun because they were very slow. Coasters were great though and luckily that's the reason why we were there!",360ccd
50,"Tips for Mgc Mtn by a ""Seasoned Pass"" veteran","Be sure you have a Discover card and get in the Discover early entry line before the gates to the park open. You get a 5 minute head start on the rest of the park, doesn't sound like much but it gives you just enough leverage to ride just about everything in the park before 1pm. When they let you in, run like the wind. We typically hightail it to Tatsu and manage to ride it twice by ourselves (yes you read that correctly). From there run to the next nearest and favorite ride and work yourself toward the back of the park. We road all our favorites in 3 hours flat and still had time to relax at home.P.S. We also make a point to produce the craziest faces and poses on the rides to make the most ridiculous photos to laugh at when we exit the rides.",Daniel V

40,How to do Six Flags as a couple with a tour company transporting you there,"Ok, this is how you do Six Flags on one day and ensure you get to do just about all the good roller coasters, particularly if a tour company is transporting you there and back and you have to leave at 5pm even though the park closes later. This is going to be a long post, but hopefully will be worth it for future reference:- Get there at least on opening time.- Buy a Platinum Flash Pass ($180 for two people)The crowd the day we went (winter, March 2012) wouldn't have been described as huge, but it was decent. We were a bit worried about blowing our money on the most expensive Flash pass, particularly in the morning when the crowds were really quite low.Before I go on, you might think hey the Flash pass is way too expensive, but think about this: (1), It would cost about as much to get into the (crappier) theme parks in Australia and (2), if you were to go to Six Flags over two days to fit this all in, not only would you need to spend another $40-odd on normal entry but you would have to pay to get out there again, plus a night's accomodation, not to mention your valuable holiday time.So having justified it this way, we bit the bullet and bought the platinum pass. Glad we did! Basically we had minimal wait times, but remember the Flash Pass (even platinum!) is not a front of line pass; it only gets you ahead of the majority of the people in the normal line. You still have to line up at the turnstyles, which can be up to an approx. 10 minute wait (more if you want to ride in the front carriage) on a 'slow' day (it might be more on a busy day by the time the Flash pass reserves you a time which is later on). We were lucky that almost all the time we were given ride times a couple of minutes after activating the Flash pass.Here's our tips to get the most out of your day on a day when there is no time wait on your Flash Pass (please remember we did not go on a day when the lines were exceptionally long):- Decide whether to go either clockwise or anti-clockwise around the park, don't waste time walking back and forth across the park cos it is quite big.- Book your time for your second next ride once the operator at the gate has removed your reservation on your Flash pass for the one you are getting on next (particularly good if the park is busy). It takes a bit more forward thinking on which ride you are taking after the one you are on but is worth it. You can go to the gate anytime AFTER the Flash Pass says you are booked in (excepting Green Lantern and X2 - more on those later) FYI we found attendants would let us in up to 15 minutes earlier than our allotted time but no earlier than that.- We were under the assumption everyone who entered the park had to pay $15 to ride the Green Lantern and X2. We later learnt this was not the case, you 'just' had to pay an extra $15 to cut the line. Line up for one of these coasters as your first ride and then pay the $15 each for the second one later. It will save you up to an hour and a half, maybe even more, wait time and provide a more cost efficient way to ride these coasters. Remember, people RUN to get to these lines once the park opens. By not knowing we should have lined up for one at the start of the day meant we missed out on going on the Green Lantern (could not justify an extra $60 in total to ride both but we felt $30 was ok - see rant further down on the cons of the Flash Pass)- Getting the platinum pass (not gold) means you get a blue band and you can stay on the ride working on the Flash pass that day two times in a row, so you do not have to line up again AT ALL; you just sit exactly where you are on the coaster.-If you want to ride in the front carriage, make sure you line up for the front carriage (usually a longer wait because more people want to ride at the front) first and then move back to wherever for the second ride. The attendants WILL NOT let you ride in the front for two rides in a row and it is too much of a hassle to rush to the front for the second one (actually it's near impossible). You have paid to ride twice in a row so you might as well use it because you probably will not get back to that ride again.- As posted in other reviews, people get narky when you basically take their spot and ride a coaster twice in a row. Our opinion was TOO BAD! Until they want to fork out a whole lot more for the priviledge of riding twice, then don't complain. We found it helped to let the attendant know as you were getting on the ride that you were riding it twice and if you were in the front row, that you would move back on your second ride.- The attendants at times had to explain to some people why we were riding a second time once we held up our wrist bands. If you are riding twice but do not care where you are sitting, then just stay in the same spot. It's too much of a hassle to try and rush to a different spot because on a lot of the rides the doors for the next lot to come through open quite quickly.-If a ride is shut down for whatever reason, then skip it and come back. The procedure to get it up and running again takes about 30 minutes (people got stuck on Apocalypse just as we rocked up to get on it and it took about that long to get it working again).Our favourite rides:X2!!! We asked an attendant her pick of the two 'big ones' and she said X2 over Green Lantern. Loved every second of it and it was well worth the extra wait to get on at the front of the ride.Tahari. Amazing (especially in the front row)Goliath and Scream are a must and Apocalypse was great tooI found the Viper knocked my head around way too much to the point of making my ears sore, while the other half found the same problem on the Revolution.Cons of the Platinum Flash Pass:While we had an absolutely fantastic day and give the rides a five out of five, the way the Flash system works we'd have to give that a three out of five. This might be harsh because it allowed us to get to so many more rides but it could be dealt with a whole lot better.For example, if you are riding up the front for your first ride, you have to scramble to get out of the carriage and get further back, they don't hold the gates back for you and you can miss out on a spot on the next ride. I get why you can't ride the front for both, but there should be a better system in place for that.If a ride is not on the Flash pass for the day, the Flash pass does not work at all i.e. you cannot ride that ride twice! What a joke! Why not make it that you can ride on all rides that day twice, even if you have to line up properly for them. Or better yet, make all the top rides on the Flash pass. Hell, you pay enough for it. The day we went, Riddler's Revenge was not on the Flash pass. We found the way to cut the one hour line was to line up in the single rider's line, but not all of the rides had single rider lines. Massive thumbs down. We got split up but at least it significantly cut down on wait time.You have to pay an extra $15 PER PERSON PER RIDE to get priority on the X2 and Green Lantern,. I mean come on people, haven't you gouged enough money out of us?? The killer was you CANNOT ride these rides twice in a row! Yet another joke. And you must be there at exactly the right time on your Flash pass, you cannot get there a half hour later and expect to get on.If you go on a quieter day, you essentially do not get as much bang for your buck. You might only pass an hour's worth of a line compared to an hour and a half hours worth of line yet there are no concessions made like allowing you to ride all the coasters twice (as with the Riddler's Revenge). And you have to go through the exits of all the rides so you can hit a whole wall of people coming the other way exiting the ride.Another bugbear was the attendants DID NOT make sure there were single riders in the line who could jump in on spare spots on the coasters if there was no single rider line which was the case for most rides. In some instances, we saw two spots going begging next to each other on coasters while the wait time was an hour-plus and there were plenty of single spots available on most of the coasters. Come on, it can't be that hard or take that much extra time to ask the crowd at the turnstiles if there is a couple or a single person who want to take those spots!The four star review is because while we give five stars to the rides, which were fantastic, but the Flash pass and the way the park is run only deserves three stars and could be significantly improved. Lift your game Six Flags! Hopefully this review helps people who wish to do all the rides in a day and prepares them for the pitfalls of buying a Flash pass.",Carmania

50,A busy Six Flags Day,"Didn't expect it too be as busy as it was on a Saturday in Febraury, but folks came out in force. Six Flags operated most of its rides at maximum capacity/trains, even though they don't get a full staff until late March for the main season. There are some areas under construction for new attractions, and the water rides were closed for the season (as expected), but they kept the all the pathways open and clear.Staff was cheerful and friendly, bathrooms were clean, as was the rest of the park.Wife did a lot of shopping, mainly at bargain prices, and I picked up a few things, taking advantage of some sales.As a regular visitor, I think the staff's attuitude and being friendly has really helped the park experence.",Darkbeer
40,Very Exciting!,"Had not been on roller coasters for many years and this place exceeded expectations for all varieties and types. Due to the season all water related rides were down. Also Superman ride is being revamped. However the newest X2 ride was absolutely thrilling and would do that ride over and over again if it were not for the extremely long lines. It was a low attendance day according to my local host, but the lines still seemed very long to me. It might be worth getting the fast pass to get past all the line waiting. The Apocalypse which is a new wooden roller coaster was great for nostalgia reasons and thrilling in its own way. You cannot compare it to the steel roller coasters as that would be unfair. The newest Green Lantern is totally unexpected in the type of twists, turns and drops. I was amazed at the differences between riding in the day versus the night which gives you completely different sensations. It did not seem possible to spend all day at the park but it is easy to spend the whole day and I would recommend it to get the full experiences. Food onsite is varied, decent, but expensive. Use of a a locker is highly recommended. Even if you have a backpack or purse that can secure pretty well, they may not allow it on and will force you to go back and use a temporary locker which will cost a $1 a pop. All the rides were pretty good and worth it.",balloonr
40,"Breathtaking rollercoasters, not so family place","We are addicted to roller coasters, and therefore, the Six Flags seemed like a dream: the fastest, highest and challenging the law of gravity coasters. We went on a Sunday, and did not buy the Platinum Pass for judging it expensive, and I think it was a good choice. We ride all roller coasters we wanted, despite the long queues, and we left them all happy. The park is beautiful, but with little shade, which becomes a problem by the sun of California.Strengths: The adult rollercoasters. Unbeatable. We do not have children yet, and therefore did not pay much attention to options for children.Weaknesses: Unlike Disney, we had the feeling of insecurity in the park. There were several groups of young men, walking in groups, with no education, and bumping into people who remained in their path. I was really scared and I believe that many families were bothered too. I've read that this is a common occurrence in the park.I hope they solve this issue.Food is expensive and there is only fast food options.When the park solve this issues, we will come back for sure!",nadia o

Speaking as an adult that was running from ride to ride, I couldn't get all the rides into one day and wish that I had another day to get through them. We got there when it opened and left a little after closing and I think we were able to get on nine coasters, which isn't bad. There is some chaos going on in the lines though. Some of the lines don't have someone instructing people where to stand, so that is an interesting human study to watch people try to figure out where they should stand and how to be with their group. Most were not very good at it making the lines longer and annoying (people not getting in on their turn because they are waiting for the next coaster so they can go with their friends, etc.) Lines are the worst part of any amusement park though, and Six Flags we will be back!",kristheexplorer

However, you should still expect some wait for the most popular thrill rides. Also, most rides were operating with only 1 train/car-- as is typical during the ""off season"". Thrill rides X2, Superman, Green Lantern and Tatsu had the longest waits. I suggest visiting on a weekend during the winter months to avoid the huge crowds.

And as for the shuttles being slow or limited... get off your fat butt and walk. It really isn't that far. Most of the time i am too busy having fun to worry about some missing paint.",RickN6900
50,Great Visit,I went in August last year we bought a annual pass because we also visited six flags discovery kingdom over in san francisco. Six flags magic mountain is the best theme park i've ever been too. There were no queues. My sisters went on gold rusher 10 times straight. They don't like the big rides. I love the big thrill rides though so we got to go on everything. x2 had no queue and everything els was just great,Nikhil S
50,The Park For Thrills,"Whatever you do, don't miss X2 or Tatsu, two of the best steel coasters in the world.",John C
40,Teens loved the rides Food and Beverage Expensive,"The teens loved the variety of rides that you just do not get in Australia. It was the off season on a Sunday, ample parking for a fee, park was only open 8 hours due to the winter season. Not allows to take your own food and beverage so take plenty of cash",PedroNastro
50,"roller coaster - fun, roller coaster - thrill, - roller coaster - fear: you get it all at Six Flags Magic Mtn :)","I hadn't been to a theme park (roller coasters) since I was a child. Six Flags Magic Mtn was recommended to me before I went to the States...adrenalin overload is an understatement. These are some of the biggest, fastest and down right scariest machines I have ever been on! The ""Deja Vu"" ticks all the boxes for thrill/fear/excitement and then (because of its name) puts you through the experience a couple of times over! There are over 20 massive roller coasters here, I can't remember all the names but The ""Superman"" was closed for maintenance and to tell the truth I was bloody relieved as the height of the thing defied all principles of fair play :)ps: it only cost $30-35 US and all free once you get except food etc. If there was/is the option for FRONT OF LINE access, definitely get it as the ques can be long.",Maxtraveller9
50,Excellent all around,"We got there at the opening bell on Sunday January 22 and were pleased to find NO crowd. We were literally able to ride each ride 2 (and sometimes 3) times before moving on. As the day went on there were more people, and by the end of the day did end up waiting 35 minutes for the X-2 near closing time. Besides that, the longest wait time was maybe 5-7 minutes. All the rides are excellent and there are many to choose from. We rode every Maximum, minimum and most of the 'in training' thrill rides multiple times. Favorites were Apocolypse, Scream, Superman, Goliath and X-2. I don't know how you would do everything in one day if there were lines for anything. It would be very hard.One of my favorite things at Magic Mountain is the customer service. As soon as we whipped out our map to find something a staffer would come up and ask if they could point you to anything. That is good service.If I had to say one negative thing, it would be no surprise...the food. It is terribly expensive, and not that good. But we were there to ride coasters - and that we did.",rockstar89
50,"Worth the risk, worth the pain!","We visited on a Sunday. We got to the park around 30 mins before it opened and gathered with the small crowd (200-300 people) waiting outside. We had a plan to walk/jog straight to x2 then think about some kind of flash pass depending on the crowd.We did the x2 about 40 mins after the gate opened and it was really good although quite short. The ride was smooth and well cushioned but at the same time extreme! Not sure how they achieved a ride where you are comfortable and terrified at the same time but this is it.We next went to the viper and basically walked on. This ride does five loops and corkscrews twice as far as I can remember. Nice line but very rough ride and I would not ride again.Best rides we recommend are x2, tatsu, batman, scream and the riddlers revenge (not in that order necessarily). All had their strong points. Batman was the most comfortable of these but still extreme and a decent length of track. My personal favorites were batman and tatsu.Colossus and viper were just painful, and we also found the green lantern painful on the last drop as your thighs get slammed into the bar as you swing upside down on the last fall.We rode 11 coasters (we did tatsu twice) in six hours and left before closing we satisfied with our day. Some of us could have ridden again....and again.The downside is as follows: the park food is limited and no healthy options we could see. The toilets were well stocked with paper and all operating but could have done with a good mopping in some spots.On a few rides the queue control was a little lacking but as the crowds were small there was no major dramas and everyone just sorted themselves out into a line.There are a few hills involved and some rides have a lot of stairs so expect to get worn out by the end of the day.Overall, If you are a thrill seeker or family with teens this is a good day out. We decided we didn't need the flash passes and this was true as aside from the x2 the only other rides we waited more than a couple of minutes for was riddlers revenge and green lantern.",fangfluffy
50,"Great day, excellent roller coasters","long lines for a couple of popular rides but otherwise minimal waits. Food is expensive, tasteless and nutritionally void.",LeeAdelaide
40,Happiest place on earth,Fantastic place. My family and I truly enjoyed ourselves at magic mountain. Park attendants were cheerful & friendly unlike those in another theme park. We'll be back for sure. And for sure we'll skip the other park that claims to be the happiest place on earth. Magic mountain should truly be the owner of that title- the happiest place on earth.,semaj2307
40,"Platinum Flash Pass: A lesson in the timely saying ""be careful of what you wish for.""","As frustrated 19 year olds, we were sitting in line for X2 when we decided that we should get the Platinum Flash Pass. We glanced to and from the sign of which we were 100 people from that said “55 minutes from this point.” And we knew that, despite 80 dollars each, we did not want to wait in such a brutally long line. We left and ran, excited as a group of college kids can ever get, to get our Platinum Flash Passes.After sitting through the instructional video, and closing my eyes as I handed over my debit card, we were prepared to have an amazing day. First thing we did, set up a ride on Goliath. “You may ride Goliath in 4 minutes,” the pretty little silver colored device told us. We looked at each other and understood that it would take 10 minutes just to run there. It was the first hint of the storm that was to come.We got to Goliath and followed the various signs that pointed to where spoiled people like us should go; ran through some very unused corridors and up some creaky old stairs until we ran into another group of platinum members, 7 people from the front of the normally 1 hour long line. We got on the ride quickly there after and had a blast on our first ride.Now for those of you who do not know, one of the benefits of the Platinum Flash Pass is that you may ride the ride twice in a row, without ever getting out of that seat. So there I am, hair blown back from the 80 mph rollercoaster I was still sitting in, when my friends and I lifted up our wrists revealing a beautiful silver wristband on our left hands. The ride operator noticed the sign of superiority and began the arduous process of explaining to normal every-day roller coaster riders what was going on.Only with Platinum can you experience such a heartbreaking event. Only with Platinum can you see the demoralizing look in a person’s eyes who is sitting at the very front of the line of which they just spent over an hour waiting in. Only with Platinum can you simply shrug you’re shoulders as the ride lock closes around you’re waist and you watch them hold back tears as they see you ride off 1 seat behind their friends they just waited in line for an hour in line with simply because the group in front of you were not platinum members as well.Such a difficult thing for me personally, I actually stood up and left the ride without using my second ride, I could not handle the look in that young kid’s eye, and it was just too much for me that first time. Needless to say, my friends were quite angry with me. They convinced me that I spent the money and deserve the special privilege, but still, something inside me just couldn’t do it.Fast forward about an hour and 25 rides later, and we were pretty beat. Yes us, a group of 19 year old testosterone filled college students were running out of steam. Here and there we were forced to take breaks, lie on the grass and be thankful for the fact that here is earth below you, not a roller coaster.As some rowdy college students, we developed a saying “Platinum!” where we put heavy emphasis on the first syllable. It was so universal, it seemed, that we could yell it to others we saw that were endowed by a silvery wristband. It was a symbol of our devotion to the idea of riding 1,000 roller coasters in a day.Everyone desires it, everyone prays for it, but do we really want it? Do we really want to ride 1,000 roller coasters in a single day? With “Platinum!” one can. However, as I said before, be careful what you wish for. Platinum is a blessing and a curse, it is good and evil, it is Yin and Yang. Platinum is here to assist us in this adventure, but there is a reason why destiny has placed the price of Platinum as very high. The Gods know, with Platinum, human kind cannot control such unlimited power, human kind cannot handle the responsibilities that come with such immense privilege.However the question still lies: Would I ever do it again?…",Chris P
40,What a blast!,My friend and i had such a wonderful time at this theme park! At first our impressions were not that great. The front portion of the park leaves a little to be desired. But once we made it to the back of the park we had the time of our lives! The big roller coasters are a blast!! We weren't able to do the water park when we were there as it was closed,island_girl8888
40,Roller Coaster Kingdom,"Six Flags Magic Mountain is not Disneyland. That is, if you or your kids do not enjoy riding roller coasters, Magic Mountain is not for you. There are, at last count, 17 roller coasters available, tying Magic Mountain with Cedars Point as the park with the most roller coasters.We had a large group and spent two days riding the roller coasters. We rode them all. The park attendance was light, and we needed both days to ride them all. The biggest issue you will have here is the wait times to ride the roller coasters. When the attendance is light, Magic Mountain tends to put less cars on the track, leaving you with 45 minute waits. On the popular big coasters, expect up to an hour and a half wait.X-2, Tatsu, and Goliath are as advertised. They are coasters that are second to none, and provide a unique experience that makes up for the long wait (up to 1 hour 30 minutes for X-2). My best tip is to hit X-2 early and first. If you are lucky, you can get X-2 and Tatsu in the first hour and a half at the park.Because of the genre of the park, there are a lot of teenagers and young adults. We did not have any issues, but there is a definite vibe than other amusement parks. Security could be better and more visible. On a crowded hot day, I would choose not to be at Magic Mountain.I give it 4 stars because the coasters themselves are awesome, and we are a roller coaster junky family. There are issues with the park (security and line wait), but if you go into the experience understanding them, you'll have a great time.",gauchojoe
30,"Cool rides, yet meh","We went on Dec 27th, so the lines were long but that was to be expect. 3 hours seemed pretty excessive though - I've never waiting that long in a line at any theme park before and I've been during peak times. The rides are great though, and we had a blast on them. What makes this park ""meh"" is the park itself. It's run-down, dirty and tired looking and there isn't any feel of attention to detail anywhere. The lines to the ride are just that, lines - even the ones with a theme like superman have you in a horribly designed tunnel that gives no sense of a ""superman"" experience (not that I'd be able to do better, but that's not my forte). But the ride is AWESOME! As you can tell I'm conflicted about this park, and I would only go again if everyone in my group insisted and my kids (both teens who love rides) feel the same way.",Michael C
40,This park has the best rollercoasters.,"I have never been to California and I decided to go to Six Flags Magic Mountain. The value is a lot for this park, but I think that it is worth it. We got through ten rollercoasters. My favorite is X2, but if you are going, be prepared to wait a lot. This ride frequently experiences minor technical difficulties. One thing that I do not like is when the park is not at its peak season. They only operate one train near the end of closing. Overall, this is a fun amusement park.",21227
30,"If you like crazy rides and lots of people, go!","I am not a fan of amusement park rides, so Magic Mountain is not for me. If you just want thrill rides and don't care about other entertainment, than you got it! I drive by the place every day and there are always cars lined up to go in. Probably a better deal than Disneyland cost wise, but like I said, I'm not a ride person so I'll pass!",mamaduck131
50,The best rollercoasters are here!,This amusement park is awesome! They have some of the best and most unique rollercoasters in the world.

20,Very average park,"We went to six flags in late December 2011 and were told to get the Platinum Flash Passes to avoid the long lines. We thought it a good idea as we only had one day at the park. Whilst it is true that your wait time will be cut down significantly, it is difficult to physically get onto the rides as the flash pass ""entrance"" is the ""exit"" for each ride. This means you spend the day having to negotiate your way around the hoard of people coming off the ride and then jump into the carriage on the opposite side of the platform which means you need to take someone's spot who has been waiting in line! The staff don't explain to the other guests that you have a flash pass so you are constantly getting death stares when you appear to be pushing in line by coming through the exit. The ride twice feature (whilst also good) also means you get death stares each time you use it so I'd also be prepared for being yelled by those guests standing in line.As for the park, it is dirty and not maintained very well. To be fair we had been at Disney the day before and it is immaculate by comparison.You also don't feel safe walking around, as there are packs of youths running around the place causing havoc. We saw many of these kids holding discount coupons/free tickets near the ticket booths so you get the impression that they are local kids who are paying a nominal fee to get in and who therefore treat the place like their own personal backyard. If you're the sort of person who enjoys Disney/Universal Studios and expect that sort of standard (in terms of cleanliness and clientele) I'd give this place a miss.We won't be returning.",Jayroe
40,Fun rollercoasters!,"This park was great for us, as we have a teenager and a tween who LOVE rollercoasters! The only ride that we really wanted to ride and weren't able to because it wasn't running, was Goliath. I would not necessarily recommend this park to people with little kids, but it is really fun for us. We will definitely go back. Our only complaint is how long of a wait we had for the more popular rides. I wish Six Flags would come up with a fast pass system like Disney.",Kirsten S
10,Dangerous and full of low-lifes,"Despite 6 Flags best efforts to promulgate rules to discourage gang members and their buddies, it seems that the thrill rides bring them out. I never feel completely safe on the rides, and the sun is unrelenting - little to no shade. Go elsewhere.",Ellen A
40,Get your coaster fix!,Great fun day out. Platinum Flash passes whilst expensive were definitely worthwhile - otherwise on a busy day you will be lucky to get through a handful of rides.

50,"Fantastic time, some rude staff","Loved the roller coasters, we got the platinum pass which gets you to the front of the line so you ride 90% less time than the queueswe felt it was well worth the moneykeep in mind it excludes 2 of the new roller coastersbut it also includes ride twice (just not in the front row)after coming from New Zealand and seeing the food served we felt the food was very good for a theme parkA MUST DO PARKbut bring your walking shoes! you feet and legs will be sore at the end of the day",mattanddan
50,Best Themepark,"this was the best theme park that i en-counted in my stay in america, me and my partner are into thrill rides and boy did it deliver. this is more a place for those wanting to ride extreme coaster than it is for younger children, there are so many different rides. since we went in end November they were only open in the weekend which i found very annoying as it meant that it was very very crowded and there also was some school thing happening which made it worse, thank goodness we brought the flash-pass otherwise would have gotten no rides done, i recommend defiantly getting this it is worth the extra money if you want to get all the rides done in one day......apart from the crowds the park itself offers amazing rides, the staff were friendly and the park was clean",vampslayer01

30,"Not great for the under 48"" kids.","I now that they were partially closed for the season, but still, there were very few rides for the smaller kids. In fact, for teenagers and adults, it was pretty good, but for the younger ones, it was a flop. The staff was great, and there were plenty of them. We never waited more than a couple minutes for any rides, and if you are going the next few weeks, bundle up. Food options are typical amusement park...expensive and much more limited with the closings. $3 for carnival games? Really???Disappointed with the park, even though I know it is not the same as the summer. Don't think I would come back even in the summer.",AZ-Traveler85253
40,Very fun day,Six flags was so much fun. If you have a day to spare and like roller coasters then you won't be disappointed. We went during exam and school time so the lines were short. The only bad thing is the food. We couldn't find anything thing that wasn't covered with sugar or deep fried. But the day was awesome and I would highly recommend going!,LittleT1987
50,A heap of fun!,"We loved it. We chose to go during the week - but there were still fairly long longs, so I'd hate to see a weekend. Lots to see and do. The food and drinks, as expected, are way over priced, so be prepared. It's not called Magic Mountain for no reason - fairly steep in some parts to walk up, so be prepared if this may cause any issues.",Time2SeeItAll
30,Way too busy,"I went to 6 flags towards the end of the season because I do not enjoy three hour long lines. I looked at their calendar, and saw that they were open on Saturday for 8 hours. Come to find out, this is a school event day and the park is packed. Each line was at least two hours long...do the math, that means only 4 rides. I did not drive 4 hours for 4 rides. Of course I expect long waits...but at least have the park open long enough to accommodate the larger crowd.I just wish it had been posted on their website that it was a school day, otherwise I would have picked a different day to visit.",Jazzlynne99
30,My son loved it but...,"We went with a promotional entrance fee, donate a toy and get a complimentary ticket. Since it is off season there were very short lines, but alot of attractions, such as all the shows and alot of the eating places were closed. They are only open weekends and limited hours off season. I took my 8 yo son and 10 yo niece and they had ball. My son loved it becauses he loves the thrilling roller coasters, he could go on alot of thrilling rides, such as X2 and goliath, but there were quite a few he couldn't go on. This place is fine for teenagers. It is clear Six flags is not really for families like Knotts or Disney. And it is clear they aren't spending much on upkeep or improvement, because they've been flirting with closure/bankruptcy. Will most likely go back if they don't close. Oh yeah been to water park hurricane harber many times, simliar with the poor upkeep, but its the closest decent water park.",KevinT8
40,So much fun,Had such a great time at SFMM. The only complaint was that they did not have lids for your drinks. Also the price of water is outrageous! The wait time in the lines was very short. Will definately return!,Tari L
40,Above Average,"I like roller coasters and theme parks. I have been to several other parks in the past 2 years for comparison -- including Cedar Point, Six Flags Over Georgia, Kings Dominion, Carowinds, King's Island, Disneyland, Disney's California Adventure.Earlier this year, I bought a Six Flags season pass, which allowed me to visit Six Flags Magic Mountain for 3 days around Thanksgiving. I found the park to be clean, safe, and fun. However, I usually find at least one ride that I enjoy riding so much that I want to ride it over and over. Unfortunately, I did not find that here. Not that the rides were bad, but nothing really stood out as a favorite.X2 -- Probably the most extreme ride, but very rough. I did ride this ride the most -- 6 times -- primarily because of the short lines.Colossus -- Very smooth and enjoyable, especially for a wooden roller coaster.Superman -- The trains run backwards up a 400 foot hill. I think it would have been more scary / exciting if the trains faced forward.Scream -- Very rough, and not enjoyable.Apocolypse -- Very fast wooden coaster, and very smooth.Riddler's Revenge -- A decent stand up coaster.Green Lantern -- This one looks tame enough, but was actually very rough. On at least two occasions, you plummet and the only thing to catch you is your lap bar which is across your stomach. Only rode once -- would have liked to tried again on a different day, but the line was over 1 hour.Goliath -- Probably tied with X2 for my ""favorite"" if there was one. Relatively smooth and enjoyable. I wish there were more ""air time"" hills.Revolution -- Pretty good ride with a single loop.The park is huge, and the walking surface is very uneven (lots of hills to climb / descent). I'm glad I came, and I would certainly like to do the Lex Luthor Drop of Doom next year.",Big80s
50,Awesome,"If you like really fast and genuinely scary rides then this is simply the number one roller coaster park going.To get the full enjoyment it is essential you do a little planning and hit the most popular rides first, the longest wait was for X2 at 1.5 hours (this was from 10.00).In eight hours we managed to hit the following rides such as X2, Apocalypse, Batman, Colossus, Goliath, Ninja, Revolution, Deja Vu, Tatsu, Viper, Riddlers Revenge.X2 was the best and Deja Vu was very disappointing. It gets very hot so make sure you keep yourself hydrated. Check out the website for discounted tickets and parking.",MS
50,Extreme Rides,"My husband and I went there to check out the attractions before we'll take our visit from Europe next month to Six Flags. We were impressed about the many and various rides they have. We went on Thanksgiving day and there were not that many people there which was great for short lines. The shows and other attractions seemed to be shut down during winter time but anyway, for those people who just wanted to make as many rides as possible it was perfect. I am scared of hights and I did regret once I was sitting in Tatsu. Can't believe that I did it anyway, I guess I didn't want to go there for nothing. But I admit, after this ride, the Goldrush and Viper my stomach and my fear told me to stop. But I know for sure, that my cousins from Europe will love this place. The season passes are a good value for those who live in this area.",Rafi1968
50,If you like roller coasters it is a must see,I love this place! There are lots of coasters varying in thrill levels. The online ticket prices make this a great value for a day of fun. I typically head out to the car for lunch since you can't take in an ice chest but do occasionally indulge in park goodies. I like the shakes at Johnny Rockets and like the food and atmosphere at Mooseburger Lodge. I also think the park has some yummy fries.,shannon a
50,Wow!!! If you want BIG rides come here,"We went here in October 2011 and were there for the Frightfest where they were open until midnight (and we stayed until midnight) it was amazing. The rides are bigger, faster and scarier than any I have ever been on in England. Also even though all the locals in LA (where we were staying) said it was massive and tiring to walk around, we didn't think so! I actually thought it was big but not too big and they managed to squeeze everything into quite a compact amount of space. This is probably because I have been to Alton Towers many times and each time going there the mono rail and cable cars have been out of order so after walking around Alton Towers all day no theme park seems big to walk around (I checked online and Alton Towers is way bigger in actual square foot than Six Flags but Six Flags has way more rides, especially roller coasters).We got free entry into the park on our LA Card (5 day pass) but the price of entry that day was only $34 if we had paid, which was an absolute bargain if you ask me. The food places around the park are your typical theme park food outlets but much lower prices than the ones you get in English theme parks (they don't seem to rip you off for being a captive audience here in my opinion) We ate at a spooky buffet dinner show in the evening which was good value, nice food and a really fun show.The queues were very short whilst we were there (never queued for more than 15 minutes for any ride) but we were there in October and during hours of 4pm - midnight. I have been told during summer the queues get really big. I would say you need a full 2 days to really get through all the rides etc if you are going in high season, even better just go in October like we did and go on one of the long opening days. This place was the highlight of our trip to LA!!",Sessel
40,Great - if you LOVE roller coasters,"I'm not a huge fan of roller coasters, but if you are, this is THE place to go in Southern California. They have some of the largest, fastest and most creative roller coasters in the USA. It is definitely a destination attraction. The parking, crowds, food and prices are typical amusement park ... and although they're not perfect, they are what one expects from a park like this. We were able to go on a special deal, and I found that the employees were helpful and generally kind. If you want to enjoy the park, go early or stay late, or both, to avoid the long lines that can stretch for an hour or much longer, for a three to five minute ride. But that is what one expects, right?",mrliterature
40,Roller Coaster Central,"Six Flags Magic Mountain has some of the most exciting coasters and thrill rides anywhere.X-2, Tatsu, and Goliath are not to be missed. X-2 has features unlike any thrill ride I have ever ridden. This place takes a whole day to do and be prepared to walk up hill, they don't call it Magic Mountain for nothing. Myself and my children, ages 21 & 12 really enjoyed ourselves and will definitely go back, however, the amount of non-english speaking teenagers constantly cutting line was extremely annoying. On the Superman ride they have changed the attraction so that you travel backwards, but they have not changed the que, we waited for what we thought was the front of the car only to be put in the back seat. It's a great park, but attention to detail is not their strong suit, kind of dusty, dirty and cob web covered. All in all we had a great time. Check the internet for bargains on admission.",Barski42
10,Disgusting,"Growing up in southern California I've been going to theme parks all my life, and my last visit to six flags was the worst ever. I've been several times before, but on my trip yesterday I could tell that the place is definitely going down hill. When we first got there we stopped at the bathrooms closest to entrance and when I walked into the girls restroom I walked right back out. The floor was completely flooded, and there was no sign saying it was out of order or anything. Disgusting bathrooms was pretty much a common theme through out the day.The other thing I noticed is that the park is not being kept up AT ALL. While waiting in line for Batman I looked up and noticed a hole in the ceiling where it looked like water had rusted through. A piece of plywood had been put up to cover it but the hole continued to expand past the edge of the board. There were cobwebs and spider webs in corners and in the arches of ceilings. Pretty much everything could use a good coat of paint. While on ninja I noticed the back of the cart in front of me was rusted around bolts and edges. While waiting in line I leaned against a railing and the railing moved back a good 5 inches. Upon inspection I noticed there were bolts missing that kept the railing bolted down. There was old gum stuck on railings and walls. Certain areas smelled awful, and the whole place just had an overwhelming sense of neglect.Then there was the food. My husband and I paid $30 for two cheese burgers and fries and two sodas. The cheese burgers had nothing but a wilted nasty piece of lettuce on it. You could tell the food had been sitting under a warmer for an extended period of time. I don't expect 5 star food at an amusement park but this really was gross. Disneylands food isn't even this expensive and tastes much better.A few years ago there was a rumor going around that magic mountain was going bankrupt. Maybe the rumors are true! Seeing the disrepair of the park just makes me worried about the upkeep of the rides, and makes me wonder how safe they really are.I used to love magic mountain but honestly will probably never come here again.",thodge
10,Magic Mountain - Very disappointing!,"Upon our visit today, we found the park to be very ""Ghetto"" now. From entering the park like a herd of cattle to being bumped into constantly by teenagers with no manners. The park is so under staffed that most of the day consisted of waiting in lines. Lots of attractions were closed, and the Moose restaurant didn't open at it's scheduled time of noon, buffet was not ready when we were finally let in, and not enough waiters for the amount of customers wanting lunch.Spent some interesting time in the Cyber Cafe that the ""Health Department"" would be interested in. Employee behind the counter was trying to ""fix"" the juice machine tube, he placed the tube in his mouth to blow air into it, and then placed the tube back on the juice machine! How nasty is that? We asked for our money back at that point and the employeelooked at us like we were crazy. This was all after waiting 30 minutes in line, with only 3 people in front of us.Needless to say that we won't be going back. Disneyland can run circles around Six Flags, maybe Disneyland doesn't ave many ""thrill rides"" but we are treated there the way you deserve to be treated and that makes us want to go back again and again.",Kck0207
20,Fun but frustrating,"I took my family back to Magic mountain in Oct 2011 we havnt been for around three years and the rides were awsume as usual. There were a couple of new rides which was nice to see but the lines were long for most of the rides. The things that make me NEVER, NEVER, NEVER want to take my family or let my kids go back there are that we follow all the rules but if your a young hispanic person in that park you are allowed to cut the line when ever you want and the park employees ignor it. There are lots of hispanic gangs and they run the park not the employees. I watched as hispanic teenagers walked past hundres of people that were waiting thier turn and go almost to the front of lines that we had to wait two hours for. This happened over and over again at every ride and the park employees that were hispanic as well ignored this even though signs are posted you will be kicked out of the park for this offense. I also notice the park is not as well kept as it used to be and it could use a deep cleaning. If six flaggs wants to be a park for all walks of life and familys it needs to get this kind of behavior to stop because I did not feel safe while I was there.",Trav W
40,EXTREME ROLLER COASTERS AND HILLS!,"I grew up in the area as a kid and LOVED, LOVED, LOVED Magic Mountain for it's fast rollercoasters.Returned with my family after 20 years on a Friday morning @ the end of October and found the rollercoasters were even more extreme but really far apart from each other and there are many steep hills to climb to reach some. Something an 11-year- old wouldn't probably think twice about, but 40-something parents had difficulty climbing. We aren't in the BEST shape, but not in horrible shape either and we were out of breath by the time we reached Superman. I wished for a tram or something to transport us up.Our boys, 14 and 17, had a GREAT time however!! There were NO lines during the time we went and they had the opportunity to get on every ride in a fairly short period of time. And even got to ride a few rides more than once, so that was great. Given the fact that some lines could be up to 2 hours. We got there @ 11 and the park closed @ midnight, but the boys called us about 9 to get picked up. So they'd had their fill which is all that matters. My husband and I cut bait and went back to the hotel early on and relaxed by the pool!One big gripe I have is that the food was really expensive.But that's the nature of the beast. But for reference, we spent $50 for a hotdog and chicken strips for the four of us.",Peppermonkee
40,Best time Ever,"Overall I we had a reat time. There were few minor things that occured like one of our things got stolen when the employees stated that we could leave our bag their. It was nothing that they could not replace.A negative things now from last time I visited is that they have lockers and everytime you want to go on a ride you must put your things in a locker. You pay a dollar for each ride and each ride its like 10 seconds, they also exper. every 3 hrs. so you cannot leave your things there. They do have lockers for all day but you need a place to put your water and bags.",wildcatgrad07
50,Best Thrills in CA,"First suggest using AAA if you have it to get best discount.Second, if you love Roller Coasters & are a Thrill Ride ""Junkie"" like me, you will not be dissappointed with Six Flags. By far X2 is the most intensely crazy good coaster I have ever been on, Tatsu is also great fun and Superman is a great rush!Finally, go on a Friday during the ""off Season"" and you will greatly reduce the time you spend waiting in lines. During ""peak Season"" go for a Tuesday visit.",kmorgan77
50,Wow! Mind blowing coasters!,"We decided to hit Six Flags Magic Mountain for Fright Fest this year. Tickets were $35 through our local MWR/ITR. The drive down the 101 to the 126 was very easy and traffic free on Saturday morning. Parking was $15. The crowds were not bad at noon and through most of the day.We decided to go to the back of the park for our first coaster and work our way back towards the gate to go against the crowds. The wait times were all less than 30 minutes and some only 15. The first coaster we hit was Scream. Wow, that was an eye opener after being in the car for over two hours and only having coffee. We both got off the ride a little woozy (couple, age 28/30). It was one of the best coasters that I have been on (previous experience at Kings Island, Ohio and Holiday World, Indiana). Scream will get your heart pumping! The ""floorless"" design is unique and adds another element to the ride.After Scream, we decided we that we wanted to cool off with a water ride and decided to walk over to Tidal Wave. Once we got there, the ride was not running on the warm 80 degree day and we were near Batman The Ride, so we decided to hop on that. It was a smooth, but twisting coaster. I had a blast; however this one pushed the girlfriend over the line. After two back to back major thrill rides, we had to take a breather...Discover Card is the official card of Six Flags and gave an instant 5% off everything, so we proceeded to use that for food, drinks and snacks throughout the day. I suggested that my girlfriend hit the Oxygen bar ($7 for 5 minutes, $10 for 10 minutes). This helped her a bit with her roller coaster nausea for a bit ...Once she was feeling a little better and after some water and some Dip n Dots, we decided to cool of on the log flume ride Jet Stream. This was a mild water ride that left you mostly dry.After that we came across Roaring Rapids. This is one of those circular white water rapids boat rides. The ride is in the shade, quite jostling in the rapids and you will get soaked! I would suggest some sort of fast drying, moisture wicking material and a change of socks. I was in all cotton and stayed wet for the remainder of the day. The water was freezing! Also, there are no lockers for this ride and you cannot set your bags or coats off to the side like other rides, so be prepared for everything to get wet or check a locker out in the front of the park if you go on this ride. I would suggest hitting this ride early in the day or when the sun is at it highest/hottest point.From there it was on to dinner. The water rides cooled us off and re-energized us, but it was time to eat! We got some BBQ from JB's. The Pulled Pork Sandwich, Tri-tip Sandwich, coleslaw and kettle chips were all good. Those two plate plus a shared large Sprite came out to $40. Good food and the price wasn't too bad. Large portions, filling and hot.At this point it was starting to get dark and the monsters were coming out at 7:00pm. We decided to try the coasters again although my girlfriend was nervous about getting nauseous again ... We got in line at Colossus. There were two lines and we weren't sure which was which. We picked the right line which was shorter and ended up being the forward running car. This was a typical wooden roller coaster with drops and rollers, but very bumpy and violent. It really shakes you around. It was cool to ride it in the pitch black with the track lights off.After Colossus I talked her in to hitting up Apocalypse. This was another wooden coaster that was quite long. The seats were padded much better than Colossus and it had a lot more interesting attributes including some pyrotechnics. This was an above average wooden roller coaster (the Beast at Kings Island is my standard). This was a fun ride and again, very cool in the dark. The wait time was near 50 minutes at this point and the park was starting to fill up for all of the people starting to line up for the mazes throughout the park.Unfortunately this was our last ride, so we only hit 4 of the 17 coasters in the park. We will definitely go back and try to get a good breakfast in before hand to get our blood sugar up and maybe get my girlfriend some motion sickness drugs to try to prevent that from happening again.We definitely want to hit Goliath, Viper, Riddler's Revenge, Superman and possibly Tatsu.We automatically ruled out X2 and the Green Lantern due to the rotating seat ""4D"" nature of the rides.I have not been to Cedar Point, but this place definitely rivals it on paper.My only real complaint is the park layout is kind of scattered and not very efficient and the bathrooms are small, dated, dirty and crowded. Also the merch stores and stands aren't very well stocked. They had no women’s small T-shirts and just an overall lack of selection. People love merchandise! I don't understand why they don't capitalize on that. At least Disney does that right ...Overall, great park! Will definitely go back!",grant805
50,Superman backwards - fab!!!!,"This is why we visit LA!!!!!It was only open at weekends when we visited, so was busy, but got to ride the ones we wanted to. It was also still vert hot!!!!We have visited in June during the week and although it was hot the queues wereso much shorter.A great park for all ages and we will be back.",pielander
30,The rides were fun but getting our tickets took too long,Ok it was the first weekend that it was open and we were excited to go to Six Flags since we have pretty much outgrown Disney. Getting our tickets was a long line and not much information. We finally got them and went on a ride right away. The line up for it was pretty quick but thats the only one of the day that was. Like I said it was opening day so we probablydeserved what we got but I just hoped for more. The rides themselves were definitely 4-5 star but with the line ups it takes them down to 3.,PamelainVictoria
40,...all the way from TX!!,"This place is awesome!! If you are coaster fan, this is definitely the place to go! My buddy and I came all the way from TX on a 3-day trip. We hopped off the plane in Burbank, rented a car and drove straight to the park. Went on Fri. Oct. 14th (Fright Fest) and there were no long lines at all. Waited about 30 mins for the X2 and Tatsu. Did ALL the coasters twice. Left to go check in at the Hilton Garden Inn...which is right down the road and a great value I might add. Got some grub and headed back to the park for the evening. Still with Fright Fest, not that crowded at all. Had a blast...now the next day Saturday, was a different story as far as the crowd goes. If you have done research, you know it can be extremely crowded on weekends!! We still got to the park early enough and got on the main rides first and enjoyed the day again. I will warn, if you have never been to MM, be prepared to walk a lot because the park is big and has lots of hills! In all, it was a great trip...even had time to go visit Hollywood.",JayRoc11
40,Fun time in October,"Typical theme park, have not been to a Six Flags for a couple of years, but must say they have stepped up and may actually be competing with Cedar Fair parks. Was very clean, ride operators where polite & friendly. Lots of washrooms and places to eat. Food is typical expensive park food. Was there on a week day so not really busy.Was there during Fear Fest, and while was good, left me walking through the mazes with my hands in my pockets, just strolling through. Not too scary at all - seen better elsewhere but still fun.",dconnau
50,Platinum Flash Pass,If your doing six flags then save up to get the platinum flash pass You zoom to the front of the line for most rides and for fright fest mazes and people were waiting for hours!Felt kinda guilty on the apocalypse loved it so much I stayed on it twice which is another cool option this pass gives you.Food prices are OUTRAGEOUS but get the homemade fudge it's really evil!,LVScott702
30,It's ok,"I haven't been to Magic Mountain in about 17 years. It was one of my husband's and my first dates so we decided to go back and visit again. The rides are great since their are some many roller coasters, but the overall appearance needs to be updated. It just seemed very old. We also went for Fright Fest and honestly I wasn't too impressed. The lines were really long for the good mazes (3 hours) and the scare zones weren't scary at all. Overall I can say that I won't be coming here again, well at least not for another 17 years or so. I'd rather spend the money at Disneyland or Knott's Berry Farm.",Heather R
50,October is the time to go,Great park. We went at opening on a Sunday and rode 14 coasters in 4 hours. We only stood in line once! it was great.The park is very clean and well laid out.,oldensign
50,The one to beat,"Visited on a hot mid-September Sunday. Went straight over to X2 where we had a one hour wait, but after that there were few lines on the rides although there was a bit of a wait for Superman (a must-do) and Green Lantern (don`t bother). The rides are (mostly) brilliant; big roller coasters galore, although there are a few head bangers so avoid the back seats if you can. It`s a huge park and even though many rides had no lines we still ran out of time to do every one of the big coasters. I suppose you could do it if you run everywhere. Food wasn`t as expensive as I thought it would be, but you`ve got no choice anyway - the sandwich police will get you on your way in at the main gate! A great day out, but do bear in mind that it`s mainly rides, rides, rides. Leave Grandma at home!",Teithiwr
40,Disappointed - closed on weekdays,"This was supposed to be the highlight of my son's barmitzvah trip to America. None of the pamphlets said anything about the park being closed on weekdays. We arrived in LA on a Sunday afternoon and if I had known, we would have arrived earlier or at least taken advantage of the fact that it's open till 10pm. When I went into the internet to buy the tickets for the next day, I found out that it is closed Monday through Thursday. As we were only in LA for 3 days, we missed out on this so be warned.",clare g
50,Exciting day out,"We love rollercoasters so a visit to Six Flags was a good call. We prebooked the flashpasses and parking but was confused when we had to buy entry tickets. Can't understand how we could buy parking and flashpasses but entry tickets were not included in the online transaction, so watch for that.The flashpasses are an essential extra if you are just at Six Flags for the day only. We got on to 15 rides and had two goes on most rides.Food in the park was disappointing, we only found fast food rather than anything vaguely healthy, but the refillable drinks were worth the price.Unlike theme parks in the UK, this park closes after dark. This was amazing, riding coasters in the dark was a rare treat.The show / fireworks made a lovely end to a great day.Remember your sunblock, keep hydrated and have a great time!",Craig H
50,This place has the Best Rides Ever!!!,"When you go to Six Flags, make sure you have a whole day there. There is plenty to do to last you a whole day. Don't forget to take sunscreen and good walking shoes and water. Take a water bottle but do not take any pre-packaged food unless it is a home made sandwich or something. They won't let you in with pre-packaged food.On busy days, the lines can get long, but don't get discouraged, the rides are worth it! Oh and one more thing, don't take a bag along if you can help it. At every ride they have lockers to store your bag but it cost money. They won't let you take you bag on the ride. This is a great place for those roller coaster lovers!!",SanDGirl_11
40,"Long queues, but worth the wait!","Spent an entire day here - 12hrs from 10am to 10pm - and managed to get on the majority of the main rides. If we could have afforded the flash pass we would have got them as we probs would have doubled the number of rides for the day. But despite having to wait in v long queues for every ride, we still had a great day! The rides are fab - every single one we went on was great. With something different! It is def for the hardcore rollercoaster lover - and X2 is just unbelieveable (rode it twice - despite the qs). Yes food is quite expensive - but not outrageous for a theme park. Had burgers from johnny rockets which were nice (although collection system was chaotic).This park is all about awesome rides!!",leolion1
40,THIS MIGHT BE OUR NEW FAVORITE PARK!!,"We visited the park for the first time on Sunday 10/9 and after reading an enormous amount of terrible reviews I was really preparing for the worst with this park. I was 100% pleasantly surprised to find the park way above my expectations. We traveled with 3 adults, 1 senior, and kids ages 16,14,12,11,and 3.I will start with my overall impression of the condition and cleanliness of the park:The park was not filthy as many reviewers had mentioned. While the park is not manicured like Disneyland and a couple of things here and there could use a little sprucing up, in my opinion, it was nothing to be bothered with. Some of the bathrooms were not sparkling clean due to high use, especially near the arcade area, but when there is a line out the door and lots of kids in and out, this is nothing surprising. On the other hand, some other bathrooms were quite clean and empty. I'm not sure anyone knew they existed. They sort of blended in.Next is my overall impression of the thrill rides:AMAZING!! If you decide to visit Magic Mountain, you should expect high energry thrill rides. Again, these are not your Disney coasters. These were meant for adrenaline junkies. All of my older kids and us adults LOVED the coaters. Definately worth the trip!A side note! We opted for the Platinum Flash Passes and I would not visit Magic Mountain again without them. The park was not overly full, but there were lines at most rides. We had zero wait time except on two rides, and those waits werea about 15 minutes. (We had to wait about 40 minutes for Tatsu, only because it had techincal difficulties.) The Platinum pass allowed us to ride twice in a row without getting off on most of the rides. Some folks in line were not thilled with that option and we got a few sneers and jeers! Yes, this puppy was expensive, but well woth it in my opinion. I really think the Gold would have been just as good on this day as it was not overly full.My overall impression of Food. EXPENSIVE!! This is the only reason I would not give the park five stars. I know that theme parks are expensive, but this place seemed a little moreso than I'm used to. The best ""deal"" we found was the bucket of chicken stips and fries with drinks at Johnny Rockets for $45. It is supposed to feed four, but we got six servings out of it. It was enought to hold us over until we left and got decent food and a decent price. By far the best deal for drinks is the souvenier cup. They were $15 and free refills throughout the day with a bracelet they give you. I think if you bought multiple cups they were cheaper each.My overall impression of Fright Fest. Lots of ghoulish fun! At 7pm the park trasnformed into a spooky place. There were zombies and mosters walking around scaring folks. It was tons of fun. There were ""safe"" zones were no frights were allowed.Other tidbits...wear comfortable shoes! This place is called Magic Mountain for a reason. It's on a mountain! Some of the areas were steep and hard to climb while pushing a stroller. I definatley got my exercize for the day. If you have little ones like we did, there is lots for them to do. The looney toons area was lots of fun and had plenty for them to ride with very little lines. Take a good look at the map, there is lots for little ones to do while older ones are riding the big rides. For example, across from Goliath little ones can ride the bucanner with an adult. Near Riddler's Revenge little ones can ride the scramber with an adult. It makes waiting for the older ones not so painful!!My final thoughts is that this place is tons of fun! It is an older park very reminscent of KnottsBerry Farm....but with much more rides and lots more walking! We will definatley visit here again. My older kids were unanimous that this was there new favorite park. That is the adrenaline junkies in them!!",JonDre
30,"Fun, but not for a weak stomach","My husband wanted to go so he convinced me to get on the rides. Since I am not a huge roller coaster/heights fan, he enjoyed them more than me. If you are into that kind of thing, they have a lot of options and some crazy rides; hubby loved them! However, if you tend to have motion sickness and/or don't like heights, don't let your husband convince you to go on them!",Melissa S
40,Fun place for the whole family.,Took my husband to Six Flags for his birthday. We had a great time. Riding Tatsu is a must. Best ride ever!,nikobi45
40,Nice and sunny day at the Six-Flags Magic Mountain theme park,We did not planned to go there but it was awesome! :)You coaster-fans will love this! By going in the morning you avoid quies and you got enough time to try all coasters.Dont bring any food or beverages inside -they will take them.of for safety reasons.Day trip costs 60$ and you can visit as many times you wish duting this and next year. Great deal for locals!Keep yourmind open and you'll have blast!,1011S
40,The kids and their uncle had a blast on the rollercoasters.,It was a great day and very hot (105') but my two grandchildren and their uncle had so much fun. I enjoyed watching them and the expressions on their faces as they came off the rides. The waits were not long. The log Jammer cooled us all off and away everyone went for more fun.For me this brought back memories of thirty years ago with my two sons and Colossus was still there. Difference this time was that I just watched. Wear good walking shoes and bring a camera. A great family day!,sc1946
30,"Lots of roller coasters, but in need of some investment -looking a bit tatty.","As per many of the other reviews, there are lots of roller coasters, so good for adrenaline junkies, but the park is in dire need of a good clean up and some proper investment. it is dirty and looking a bit tatty.",weary_traveller1980
40,Great Fun for Teens,"Magic Mountain is definitely a park geared toward teens and young adults. Most of the rides have height restrictions.To allow for younger guests there is a very small section for small children. However, the eight-year-old in our party was able to ride on quite a few of the major roller coasters. I was thoroughly impressed with the number of coasters available. We spent a good 9 hours at the park and were not able to ride all of the them. The lines were quite long for the most popular rides but surprisingly short for the rest. It was definitely worth the price of admission. At less than half the cost of most of the theme parks in the area we will most definitely be back.",amosann
40,Roller Coaster Junkie Heaven!,"Calling all roller coaster junkies! Six Flags Magic Mountain is the place to be if you feel the need to overdose on adrenaline, flip your stomach inside out and lodge your heart in your throat.My sibling and I made Six Flags an entire day trip. We even went there using public transport and despite the rumors about LA's public transport system being rather lax, getting to Six Flags via train and bus was smooth and efficient. It's a bit of a haul though, so if you're planning on taking this mode of transportation, the key is to get up early. Here's how to get there via public transport:1) Take the Metro Red Rail Line up to North Hollywood station.2) Upon exiting the station just head on down to the bus stop by the side of the road. Take the Santa Clarita 757 to McBean Transfer Station.3) From McBean Transfer Station, take Santa Clarita 7; it says Magic Mountain on the front of the bus.It's like a 5 minute walk to the front gates from where the bus drops you off, but it's not that much of a hardship. You can buy an all day Metro ticket for $5 which gets you on the train and the bus. It's a cheap and green alternative to driving your car and you can avoid those crowded parking lots.The amusement park itself is really a roller coaster heaven. Again, to avoid spending half your day waiting in line, get there early. Preferably, before they open; they do a pre-opening get together thing but try to stand close to the entrance gates because when they finally open the doors, it's a mad rush to get it.My suggestion would be to do all the extreme rides first as they are the ones with the longest queues. With this in mind, eat a light breakfast or you'll be cleaning it off yourself.Speaking of food, every confectionery, & fast food stand there is a total rip off. We ate at Johnny Rockets and immediately regretted it. $6+ for a milkshake?? A milkshake that was half whipped cream, mind you. I would say pack your own meal but they don't allow outside food in.Some of the terrain of the theme park is quite hilly so I would suggest sensible shoes; chucks, sneakers, boots. Also pack the sun block; you gotta love that California sun.All in all, Magic Mountain was an unforgettable trip. If I lived in LA, I would snap up a season pass (the cost of two entry tickets apparently) and head there every weekend. It's THAT worth it. i would rate it 5/5 but the food prices drop this must see attraction to a 4/5.",warriorbard
30,Not what it used to be,"I traveled down to Valencia, CA to ride roller coasters, as this is one of my favorite vacation activities. I had been there several years prior, and was excited to see what new rides were available. I was sorely disappointed. The park was dirtier than I expected, it was full of younger people - not a diverse crowd like I found in Disneyland - and the cost to receive priority boarding for each ride was astronomical and I didn't necessarily get on the rides before other people. The line for X2 was a long wait, so if you go - ride this first. Viper and Batman were rather boring, and the only ride I found was a thrill (for the wait time) was Colossus, which I rode first. I don't want to have to run to rides in order to beat the line -- especially when I paid extra for priority boarding. I won't go back.",StrollMyWorld
40,Great place for rides and only rides,"My kids had been there before but it was my first trip to Magic Mountain. The park is for rides and only rides, no shows that day at all and limited shopping. The signs that estimate wait times were quite accurate, which I appreciate. A new ride, Green Lantern, was listed at 48"" to ride in the park's handout but after waiting a few minutes we had to get out of line as the attendants pointed to a sign that said 52"" to ride. That was the only glitch in our fun day there. Good variety of food, drinks and snacks available, too. Some rides offered a separate line for single riders and that got my daughter on some rides with no wait.",Mary Beth W
40,great place for thrill seeking riders,"My wife & I went during the last weekend before school started again. The park is huge & there is a bit of walking to do - some areas have very steep inclines & can test those not in the best shape. These rides here are probably the most heart-racing ones that I've ever ridden. It was pretty crowded at this time & it was a bit toasty. The bathrooms were decent - I was expecting a dirty gas-station bathroom type of thing after reading some of the reviews but they were clean & did not smell. The food was ok but not exceptional - it was either the turkey leg or the crazy-awesome rides that made my wife nauseous halfway through the rides but we'll never know. On the crazy crowded days for out-of-towners who only have one day in the park - the Flash pass is the way to go. Sure you spend a lot of money but u get to ride a good amount of rides in the limited time you have - I think had we not bought the gold flash pass (you don't get to skip to the very front but you are very close) - we maybe would have ridden 4 rides in the 5 hrs we were there as the lines were pretty long & the standing in the heat may have gotten to us. There are all day lockers in the front area where you can buy the flash pass for about $11/day so it's not necessary to use those one/time use $1 lockers unless you want to put away your refillable bottle (which is worth buying for those long hot days). We had a good time @ Six flags & wish we could have stayed longer had my wife not become nauseous. I really enjoyed X2, Tatsu, & Goliath. Green Lantern broke down a few times that day & we didn't feel like waiting in line wondering how long it would take to get it back up. You can find deals to buy tickets for less than the window price - just have to look around online for them. If you are not a local & won't be able to spend multiple days at the park, I highly recommend the flash pass (I read reviews that platinum is nice but may not be justifiably better than gold for the price) Only bad thing is that if you wish to use the flash pass for X2, you have to pay an extra $15 per person & it's a one time thing.",mr.tomcat
50,Best Coaster Ever!,"Although the lines were tough, the roller coasters at Magic Mountain were fantastic. X2 and Superman made the trip from the east coast completely worth it. Had to wait over an hour for X2, but we were loaded up at 10 pm and had the best ride of the day. Going at night makes it even better.",m4squad
50,Always love coming here,Been coming here since i was 9 and now my husband and i go every year. We like to go on the weekends when kids are in school. Great place if you like fast roller coasters,MaMa6363
50,best deal in SoCal for EXTREME rollercoaster rides,"I have been going to six flags for many many years. It isn't disneyland. It doesn't have much in the way of cute theme areas. but for the most intense wild and extreme roller coasters around this is the only park to visit. The $$ deals to go here can be amazing too. I often will buy the year pass for about 70 dollars. If you do do this, be sure to visit on one of the pass holder only pays. you will literally feel like you have the park to yourself. ZERO wait lines for all rides including X2. I rode it 4 times in a row without getting off before I had my fill. I lost my wallet on that crazy ride even though I thought I had it secured. 2 days later I got it back in the mail complete missing nothing. they walk the ride (under it) and retrieve items nightly. GREAT JOB GREAT PARK. (only draw back for me. its a long and often sucky ride from carlsbad)",ndepndant
40,Great Day Out!,"A definate great day out, there was 8 of us and there's a deal for 10 people, so we found a couple to go in with and got a much better deal, pretty much half the price. So try and do that as it's a great money saver.We went and it was empty as kids had just come back from the summer term, but we still didn't get to do all the rides, that was my only downside, it's massive!But a great day out, bring the sun cream!",Danny H
40,Great day out!,"We visited here recently whilst visiting relatives in sacramento in July.What a great, fun park! The lines fir rides weren't too horrible and staff were friendly.Bring sunscreen! And check out the orca whale show.",Ccsydney1
50,HOT - but great!,"Went here last weekend and the temps went to about 107, so the crowds really dissapeared! We had 12 people, so we were able to get the group rate ($25 a ticket) and since we scored a deal on that, we got the flash pass (basic version). What a deal! We skipped almost every line (no flash pass on Green Lantern, Dejavu, or X2). Rode every roller coaster that was worth riding (didn't do Ninja or anything below that level). Tatsu is an amazing ride and the only one we did twice!Flash pass is definitely worth it, BUT as I said the weather may have contributed a lot to the crowd size being smaller. On a day with huge crowds the basic version of the pass might not be as worth it since you have to wait a long as everyone else in line. The difference is, as soon as you get to a ride and check in with the attendant you can scroll through the list of rides and pick your next one. That way you burn 10 minutes as you wait to get onto the ride you just got to, a few minutes on the ride, and then 10 to 15 to get to the next ride. If you do it right, there should be almost no wait once you get to the next ride. But of course, if the lines are huge then the middle level pass would probably be worth it since you just get to cut the line no matter what. The highest level doesn't seem worth it to me for the price. Yes, you get to ride twice back to back, but even with just our regular passes we were able to check back into Tatsu and ride again with only a short wait!",Steve M
40,"Great coasters, poor organization and less than helpful staff","Coasters were great, my favorite probably being Tatsu, then X2. Rode most of the rides but didn't bother waiting for Superman as the line was long and didn't look worth it.Some of the rides were a bit uncomfortable such as the Riddler was hard on the ears. The park is definitely not as clean and polished as other parks (Disney/Universal) but you go for the thrills. The worst part was the lack of organization. We were there at opening and just about to get on X2 when something broke down. They announced the ride was experiencing technical difficulties (which you could barely hear) and there was no communication beyond that. We waited 20 more mins and asked an attendant who had no information (eg. cound be 5 mins or 5 hours). We decided not to waste our time and walked away asking an attendant if we could get a pass to come back with no waiting. Was advised they couldn't do this and then found out the ride was opening up again. They let us go back to our spot but this was annoying.No single rider lines (or they weren't using them) therefore many open spots on the coasters caused for longer lines than necessary. I went with my wife who didn't want to ride some of the more extreme coasters. I had to wait in the same line as everyone else and I could see a bunch of seats empty up ahead. Even when you got to the front of the line there was nobody asking you how many in your party (except for Green Lantern). This wasn't very organized and didn't make for a great experience.All that being said we got cheap tickets online through Entertainment book and were only 30 mins away as our Hotel was in Glendale so it was a pretty good day overall. Wish the park had opened earlier as we could have gotten more rides in.",djpositivek
50,awesome roller coasters!!!,"My family and our 2 (11 and 13) children were staying in Anaheim for the week. They are just too old for Disney so we decided to head to Magic Mountain. It's about an hour and a half (without traffic) from Anaheim. I have to say that this was the best theme park we've been to in terms of roller coasters and overall thrill rides. The park was open from 10:30 to 6 so it didn't give us much time but we did go on all of the coasters. All are amazing. There were only 2 that I would not recommend. First, Riddlers Revenge - you sort of sit/stand on these uncomfortable banana type seats and the ride really bangs your head around. The other one we didn't like was Viper because it really was a head banger. Goliath is amazing, along with Tatsu and Superman. The 2 newest coasters - x2 and Green Lantern were really cool. The coasters here are all very unique. Even the wooden coasters are great. Apocalypse was fast and probably the best wooden coaster because of it's speed. If you have tweens or teens, this is the park for you. Also, if you're a thrill-seeking adult like me you'll love it too.",kimbop324
40,Whoa Nelly super awesome rollercoasters!,Best rollercoaster on planet earth is X2! Holy crap it is an adrenaline rush and peaks every sense possible on the human body! I would go to six flags again just to ride this ride and to watch the Hypnotist who performed there in July.....Hypnotist Chris. Only downside are the ridiculous lines to ride rides. Some of the lines were 4 hours long! I videotaped one of the rollercoasters this year: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-uaEaAXDOA,amabrey
30,"Lack of security caused headaches, due to line jumping","Chose to go during school day , but hundreds of trips were in attendance. Used to long lines ,but on every coaster 50 to 75 teenagers and some adults would simply walk from back to front of line or butt line at front and at no time did anyone from the park question this behavior. The experience is certainly not cheap and some regard should be given to considerate people who are willing to wait their turn.",airjerdan21
40,Fun rides but EXTREMELY long lines!,Lots of super fun rides! The part we did not like at all was the extra long lines. Most were at least an hour and some were up to two hours long. The frustrating part was that it could have been avoided by opening up the other half of the ride. It was almost like they wanted the lines to be long. Disneyland and Disney World are ran so much more effeciently than Six Flags.,SLW18
50,Great for adrenalin junkies!,"This park is full of really heavy roller coasters. Great for adults and teens, but not for families with younger children.Look out for coupons, they save you lots of money. You can easily get tickets for under $50 each.Food and beverages are pricy as usual.Waiting lines may be long (>90 minutes), especially at noontime. Opt for flash passes that get you to the heavy coasters faster.",neverco
20,"Don't waste your time, energy or money on this run down park","I was so looking forward to this as we are adrenaline junkies and love roller coasters, thrill rides etc. (and the Griswolds) Had been to Universal Studios a couple days prior to our visit and we were really looking forward to big thrill rides as Universal is all simulators etc.First off the park does not open until 11 a.m. (I went on a Thursday), the que to get in was ridiculous but moved fast enough.I went straight to a locker at the entrance do store the bags ($11, $14 & $17 depending on size you want).Proceeded to the first attraction, The Tatsu, the que made me want to throw a tantrum! I had never bought fast passes in any theme park before but I turned on my heel and went straight back to the FLASH PASS office, I knew there was no way we get on more than 3 or 4 attractions if we had to stand in the regular line.I had to wait an hour in line to get a FLASH PASS, yes an hour. Not only was the que huge but the computer system crashed while I was about 30 places away from a cashier...we were all told that they could now only accept CASH. I did not have alot of cash on me only my card. We were then told the system could come back on any minute so it was up to us if we wanted to continue waiting in line. I took the chance and remained in the que, just as I got to the cashier the system came back on and I was able to purchase a PLATINUM FLASH PASS. This cost me $251 for 3 people.However, it did not include entry to the newest ride The Green Lantern, if we wanted flash pass access to this it was an extra $15 per person, what a rip off :(I declined the green lantern upgrade (really disappointed as was looking forward to this ride) as I could not justify $45 for us to go on this ride after paying for a flash pass. Each time I passed this attraction the que time was 2 hours, therefore did not get to go on it.Now to the attractions - I was really disappointed with the majority of these. To be honest they are all really similar, harness comes down and you get thrown about a few loops for 60 seconds. The only ones that really stood out for me were Goliath and Superman. I love rollercoasters that the car climbs up and then gets flung down the other side but most of these rides are all loops; ok a few loops I like but they are not as thrilling as the big dips and drops therefore I was disappointed there were not more of this type. The superman ride was fantastic and because we had PLATINUM FLASH PASSES we also had a wrist band that allowed us to stay on a ride (without having to get off and que again) but because we were rushing about trying to fit as many rides as possible in we could not take full advantage of this wrist band (and when we did stay on one particular ride we got abuse from a lady waiting in line when she saw we weren't getting out of our seats lol)In my humble opinion if you are from the U.K. and are thinking of giving up a day of your holiday in California to come here, DO NOT. This has nothing that Alton Towers can't offer you, so ignore the descriptions on their website, these rides are not what they are all cracked up to be. Plus the heat during the summer is unbearable.Now onto the appearance of the park and the staff. After becoming accustomed to the spic and span parks that are Universal and Disney and overdosing on in your face friendly staff all trying their best to make your experience one you will never forget, this place does the opposite. The staff look like they want to kill you (with the exception of the staff on the Superman Ride) and to see the bored almost zoned out look in most of their eyes while you are waiting in a que to board a machine being operated by one of them is quite disconcerting.The park itself is quite run down and almost impossible to navigate around, signposts and maps are few and far between. We actually looked like nutters trying to get out of the park at the end of the day (we had a bus to catch) as we could not find the exit lol The toilets only have about 4 cubicles in each so the que was always huge and took forever. The pavements are cracked and the stalls just look run down and dated.We ate in Katys Kettle - VILE - $42 for 3 meals and 2 cokes. The food was cold and just looked wrong, again the que was huge and overall was a horrible experience. There is a Johnny Rockets somewhere in the park we just hadn't the energy to go look for it.If you do decide to visit you need a full day here, I think it is open til 9 or 10 p.m. Bitterly disappointed with my visit to Six Flags California, sorry I didn't try Knotsberry instead but the promise of the biggest and best thrill rides in the world led me here. Biggest and best ques alright and the thrills they offered just weren't worth it :( even riding on Colossus made famous by the Griswolds didn't lift my spirits.",TravellinTash
40,Fantastic theme park for teenagers,Lots and lots of roller-coasters. Lines which are well managed. Not a park for very young children.Make savings by booking your tickets online in advance.,saraben
50,Fantastic Roller Coaster park!,"We had a great day in this big, good looking park. The Rolle Coasters are good, wild, crazy, amazing and wild, depending on what you like. We were two adults and we did 8 different of the large roller Coaster, then our stomachs couldn't handle anymore.The park is nice and big, didn't seem crowded. Some lines were long, but not longer then you would/should expect.Only thing to notice is that the food seemed a bit pricy..",Lasse K
40,Good Value. A must for Coaster Junkies!,"This is my 4th time back to 6 Flags MM. I have a love hate relationship with this park. Theres good and bad to MM, but all in all I need a MM fix once and a while and have been a season pass holder twice. They seem to always run on a skelaton staff. Doesnt matter what time of year. Where it shows up is at the gates and food cocessions where you can expect to waste lots of time in line. Tip: buy your ticket on line and some times you get a seasons pass for the price of a day admission or an upgrade for $10 to a SP. Expect to pay $15/ day for parking unless you get a premium seasons pass. There is a tram from the parking lot to the gates and this is the beginning on your 1st of many long lines of the day. Three is a parking lot security guard in each lot who sits vigil in a tower and Ive never had problems.The food is expensive in the park and they hastle you if you are taking any in. At least they fill u full at their concessions, but its the unhealthy fried crap and you will pay double what its worth. You can buy a season collectors cup that they will refill with pop. Its like $12 for the cup and you get free refills for the day and its good on other trips then its 99c for a refill. By the end of the day theyre filling it with water for free cause I get sick of pop.The coasters at this place are top notch. I usually leave the park all messed up cause there are some really violent ones. The lines on the priemiere coasters are long but are worth the wait. At peak times you can expect to wait an hour plus for the biggies. The older coasters and attractions are still exciting to me and I keep coming back for some reason. Ive never bought a flash pass and they are limited per day from what I understand. If you are on a shoesting for time it might be worth it.There is a small kids area with a ball house and wee kiddie rides. There is enuf to distract a 4-9 yr old long enough for others to take in a few of the bigger rides if you split the group up.This is a MASSIVE park over un even and hilly terrain and if you are on the down side of life like me, you will be spent by the end of the day. Use the sky tram to get to the top of the mountain or you'll use your reserves really quik. Good shoes are a must. I tried to tell my girlfriend and her daughter not to wear flip flops. They learned the hard way fashion is BS!!I went years ago during Halloween season and they really put on a good show with walking zombies, dry ice fog and a haunted house that really puts a smile on my face.So there you have it. I hate the crowds and lines, terrain and I leave felling terrible physically, but somehow I cant wait to go back and I fell like a GREAT BIG KID when I think about my time there.!!PS MM attracts lots of low life east LA types, but i've never had any problems with them other than truck driver / sailor talk.",Saskheat
40,amazing if you are young and like coasters,"We got discounted tickets at $36 off the internet instead of the $61 for the price at the gate. Took a risk as we couldn't have got any money back if we'd been unable to go. Arrived at 10.10 am and there was a huge crowd already waiting in the baking heat. A great horde surged forward when the gates opened at 10.30. It would have been better to have let us in earlier to arrive at the ride we wanted first.My daughter has the nerve to go on the bigger rides. The log flume and sky tower rides are my limit.The queues were horrendous for almost every ride, but I must admit the rides ""looked"" generally good and exciting.There were very few (if any) decent places to eat and we ended up with a huge turkey leg each. Needless to say, we never want to see a turkey leg again!Certainly worth the money we paid, but think the park really favours younger thrill seekers than us.Not a lot for us older ones.",E&JJJ
40,Great Park Awful Bathrooms,"The park was awesome, the rides great. The bathrooms were awful. They appeared to not have been cleaned all day. People were smoking pot by the Panda Express just down from the X2 ride. We actually watched a person roll a joint.",jnelson5
40,Six Flags Magic Mountain,"The park is not dirty nor are the people unfriendly. I found the park to be fun and the employees friendly. The park is clean. The lines are long but they have the best roller coasters, there is something for everyone. If you plan to attend the park be prepared to wait in line.",LeaLea73
40,Great place but very crowded,"I love roller coasters and amusement parks and this is the first time I have made it down to Magic Mountain. Unfortunately it wasn't the sole purpose of the trip so we were only able to stay there about three fourths of a day and it was a Sunday. It was so crowded that we had to pick and choose what rides to go on. The rides that looked amazing had such long lines that I will have to go back to try them on a weekday. However, the rides that aren't as popular are still very good and just as good as the best rides at many other parks. The wait for those, such as Batman, were not very long and we were able to enjoy those a few times. The park seems to be great for anybody looking for great rides, but the crowds make it difficult. You also get a good workout hiking around the hills to get to some of the rides which could be tough for some people, but I actually liked that part of it.",kingswin
30,Let's ripoff the tourist,"We got very cheap tickets ($26.00 per person for the day) through a family member that resides in California and is a member of the military. Before we drove to the park we made a stop at Walmart in Santa Clarita on Old Rd., purchased some groceries to make sandwiches, sodas and bottled water. We then drove to the park and found a spot to park, unloaded all the groceries and walked to the pickup area, it was then that we noticed a sign that says that food and drinks from the outside are not allowed, so we took everything back to the vehicle thinking that it could not be so bad inside the park. Well, it was that and more, $3.75 for a 16oz. bottle of soda or water, $4.50 for a chocolate covered banana. This were the least expensive items in the park, so you can imagine how expensive everything else was. The rides were excellent the restrooms kept clean, but the food prices were out of the reach of the common man.",TRUTH777
30,More than one day is required,"We found good deals for tickets on eBay for our family of 6. My family & I went here for our son's 6th birthday. We have 2 other children, 8 year-old & a 3 year-old. Prior to going, we checked out the different types of rides they will be able to get on so we knew we weren't wasting out time going with little ones tagging along. Before we entered the park, we ate at the Wendy's right off the exit to avoid the expensive lunch at the park or the long lines just to get food.When we got to the park, we had to park in the gravel area. We attempted to take the tram ride to the park's entrance, but there's no real line to get on. People just push & rush to get on those trams so we decided to just walk the mile to the park in the heat.Each of the ticket lines have these Coca-Cola life sized bottles to insert cans and bottles for recycling right next to the ticket booths, & they were infested with bees! Move those things or put some kind of repellant on those bad boys! Someone can get stung!It was so hot that the first ride we wanted to go on was the Roaring Rapids ride. The entrance had these signs with all these warning & stuff & to top it off it said it's a ""Family Ride."" Shame on us cuz we were in line for more than 2 hours, then when we got to the front, my 3 year-old daughter was too small to get on the ride. They offered to allow the other parent who couldn't get on the ride to ride next with one of the other children, but I refused because it took the fun out of it being a ""Family Ride."" So I suggest that if you just want to cool down by getting wet, head directing to the bridge of the ride Tidal Wave. You are sure to get soaked & you don't have to wait in those HOURS LONG LINES. I suggest to bring towels & extra clothes in case the little ones are too cold to get through the day. We were fortunate enough that it was so hot that the clothes us adults wore dried in the heat.We finally decided to get something to eat. We grabbed 2 tables since 1 table could only host 4 of out 6 of us. My daughter spilled her soda & bees began to swarm the table, so I asked the people working in the pizza place where we got our food if they could please have someone clean up the table. No one came, so I went back again, but this time they just looked at each other. No one ended up coming, so I demanded to speak to a manager. The manager informed me that the tables were not their tables that's why no one's coming to clean them. I asked her who is in charge of the tables, & she wasn't quite sure. She said she thinks it's the maintenance crew. I told her that bees are starting to swarm the table & my children may be stung, & if that's the case, then why didn't her employees tell me that instead of saying nothing & stare at me or each other?!? I was pissed because even then nothing was done!Side note: We had the opportunity to run into Ron Artest who was also enjoying with his family at the park!The park was so big that by the time we got to the actual kiddie rides that my little ones could ride, the park was near closing. We now know where to get wet to cool down & to go directly to the kiddie area so the kids could enjoy the park longer.When we left the park, my mother was too exhausted to walk the mile back to the car, so we decided to actually take the tram. The first 2 tries to get on the tram were unsuccessful because of the amount of people bombarding to get on. We finally got on the 3rd attempt after coming up with a strategy for all of us to get on. We stood side by side in the very front & we held hands. My middle child almost got squished against one of the seats because people behind him were rushing to get on. Considering how many people were at the park that day, the park should provide a lot more trams & have people delegate people getting on because it's very dangerous!2 or more days at this park would probably be better to be able to enjoy everything you'd like to enjoy OR come up with a game plan ahead of time. Check out their website to see what rides you'd like to get on & what everyone could get on if you've got little riders with you. Otherwise, you're just going to be wandering around their huge park & waiting in HOURS LONG LINES.",iNa_MeAnA
10,Horrible customer service,"Went to Magic Mountain today as the highlight of or trip to USA. Have spent the last days in San Diego Zoo, Sea World, Universal Studios and today was supposed to be the grand finale..First of, forgot to buy tickets online. Online you get daypass for $37 dollars, or you can bring a can of coke with a great deal. This is my bad, had to buy the ""normal"" ticket for $62.Walked up with my girlfriend, told the girl in the ticket booth i wanted two daypasses. She told me the price of $143.98, I was puzzled about the price, but thought it might be due to some taxes or something. Got my reciept, she had charged us for two seasonpasses, to the price of $71.99 each. Confronted her with it, told her I said I wanted two daypasses, not season pass. She told me that was not what I said (what ever happend to ""the costumer is always right""?). She looked to here screen for one second, then told me she couldn't undo it, the computer wouldn't let her. Told her I wanted to talk to her manager, she called her manager, then came back to me and said there was nothing she could do. I said to her again; ""I want to talk to your manager, not you"", she said the manager was busy and couldn't come down. WHAT HORRIBLE SERVICE?!This ruined my day, not for the $20 extra I paid for her mistake, or for the $50 extra I had to pay for forgetting to buy tickets online, but for the damn principle. It angers me just to think of it.Besides from the horrible customer service, as many other writes here, the lines are endless.. Be prepared to wait 1-3 hours for every ride. No sings of how long you have to wait, if you want the FlashPass they're more expensive than your ticket, and that is if you want the ""cheap"" version, there are 3 levels of pricing, don't want to mension the other two.The place is filthy and just looks sad, food is overpriced, as well as drinks. Locker rentals is expensive. You will also need to rent a locker for $1 at every ride, as you cannot bring a purse, drinks or anything to the ride. Parking is $15.We will not be going back there, had a very bad experience.If you don't mind all i mensioned above, the rides are great, but to enjoy them you will need a expensive FlashPass, you just cannot enjoy your day waiting up to 3 hours for a 1 minute ride.",FuzZ87
10,No Longer Enjoyable!,"This is the third or fourth time I have been to Magic Mountain. Th last time I was there was about 8-9 years ago. MM has become a coaster park with state-of-the-art roller coasters. Really some great rides. HOWEVER, the wait times for each ride now amount to 1-3 hours per ride. We were there yesterday for 9 hours, at least 6 of which were spent waiting in line. The temperature was 90+ degrees and people were dropping from heat exhaustion. The waiting lines have too little shade and almost all of the fog (water) misters were turned off. The park is really about all of the money they can extract from you -- little concern about the guests.At our first stop after park opening, X2 (a great ride), the wait was 2 hours and 44 minutes. We saw 2 young people requiring medical attention while in line. About 90 minutes into the wait, Coke machines appeared, $3.75 for a 20 oz. bottle of soda or water. One of the girls in our crowd inserted a $5 bill and was given only 25 cents change. I called the number posted on the machine and they offered to mail a coupon for a free (??) 20-oz. bottle of soda. NO REFUND for the dollar that the machine stole!Here's another rip-off: at every ride, you are required to put your belongings into lockers at a cost of $1 per use. There are warning signs that say that items left for more than 120 minutes will be removed. So that adds more cost to riding the rides.All in all, the rides are great. The waits are not worth it! Due to the greed of the park, they have really made it a miserable experience. At least at Disneyland, there is the Fast Pass system that when used correctly, really enhances the visit. At MM, they have what they call Flash Pass, AT A COST OF UP TO $500 FOR A SINGLE DAY FOR A GROUP OF 4!! Rip off! Isn't it amazing the level of mediocrity and total wasting of time and money we as Americans have agreed to accept?Did I mention food prices? They are known to have the highest pricing for food at any California theme park.Also, unlike Disneyland, you can quickly see that at MM, basic maintenance (e.g. painting) is not a priority, as there is a lot of peeling paint and accumulated trash in areas that should have daily clean-up.The best part of the day was the dinner we had at a nearby California Pizza Kitchen!",Peter S
50,FANTASTIC - LOVED EVERY MINUTE,"Myself and my daughter and her fiance visited Six Flags last year in August we LOVED it,we live in Australia and honestly it was worth the trip,we are planning another trip with my other kids.We went on a very HOT day and it was so packed but we still enjoyed it.Have to agree with other reveiwers the food is very expensive as we visited Disneyland and also Universal studios when we visited last yaer so when you think about it you pay a fortune at any theme park you visit!! Even in Australia at our theme parks you pay a fortune for food here as well!You have to plan ahead to visit expecially if you go on school holidays etc.as you know it will be very crowded so plan what rides you want to do first and head straight there when gates open! Myself and my father are coming back to America in September this year but l am disappointed we are not doing Six Flags this time,my dad is not into those sort of theme parks.But when l come back over in 2013 l will be coming back then cannot wait!!",Melleasa
40,Great time!,"Look for ticket deals online. Wear comfy shoes; Bring a stroller if you have small children as the hills are treacherous in areas; Expect long lines (unless you're financially-able to purchase the Flash Pass, which i think is rediculous); Expect to pay a fortune for food/drink. The lockers are expensive, $11-$14, however, you can get into them all day with no extra charge. The ride operators are to be desired...the gal on Viper was extremely annoying, so expect to hear a lot of meaningless chatter that is completely inaudible!We had a great time, overall, and the rides are quite exciting. My favorite was Goliath for its steep drops and smooth ride. Least favorite was Riddler's Revenge as it was uncomfortable and gave my head quite a beating!",swebb70
40,Bring Money and strong legs,"We had a blast! but it is not an inexpensive trip, unless you want to spend your day hungry and waiting in long lines.Bring Good walking shoes, a small camera and a sense of humor and you will have a fun day.We were fortunate to have a business discount for admission ($33) But that was the extent of any discounts. I am telling you all this to set your expectaion level correctly, which will stop any sticker shock you might encounter. My advice is to thouroughly review the Magic Mountan web site, before you go - this will greatly enhance your visit.Parking was $15 and then you need to decide on 3 different levels of ""Fast Pass"" again, go to the web site. SInce it was a Saturday, during peak vacation time, we purchased a Gold Flash Pass and it was a life saver! The gold pass cut our wait times to almost nothing. No way we could have gone on every single ride, without the gold pass. - Pricey but worth the cost -- at least to me.The park is big - I mean --- b i g, so be prepared to walk, plan your day and have fun. Favorite ride was Batman, but X2 ran a close second (Long line there and the Gold pass was a must - or it's a 2 hour wait.)I could go on with details but in the end...... It was a fantastic, fun day. 4 adults, 2 teenagers and a 2 year old! Fun for all. We stayed in Santa Clarita Saturday night and that -- was a good decision. Tired!",RIVERMAN63
40,Best park for thrill rides,"Our family (2 adults, 2 teenage boys) visited Six Flags on a Friday. It was fairly crowded-we opted to purchase the VERY pricey platinum flash pass. For us it was worth it, we had only 1 day to visit and probably won't be in the area again for years so we felt like we had to make the most of the day. Glad we did! Not only can you make reservations for a ride and not stand in line but you can ride twice without getting back in line. Our boys were able to ride most of the rides at least twice, they had a fabulous time. Food is marginal and expensive, bring an empty water bottle and fill from drinking fountains to save some $$ on drinks. One thing that the park could improve would be benches or other seating for those who are waiting for riders or just need a break! A couple of the rides were not included in the admission price (purchase tickets online prior to arrival for significant savings) and this was quite irritating considering the cost of admission and the Flash pass. If you love thrill rides, it is worth the cost!",Whiteners
50,Six Flags-Great Customer Service,"My family and I were enjoying the great rides at Six Flags theme park. On one of the roller coaster(X2), my pockets were emptied of their contents. One of which was the key to the rental car we had taken on our 5 hour drive to get to Six Flags. We thought we were stranded at the park. 3 of the 6 had to work in the early morning the following day. The rental car company said we were on our own to get a key cut and programmed. Locksmiths were quoting us $300-$400 for the job. We explained our plight to James the ride's resident security person. He was very understanding and said he would make sure the ride attendants do a thorough job after the ride was shut down and a security sweep was executed for the lost objects of the day. James also gave us the business card of a mobil locksmith who said he would come out and do the job for $200 gauranteed . We waited an hour after the park was shut down. FInally the security people brought the loot bag to lost and found. Low and behold they had recovered our lost key. Also the locksmith James recommended came to the park just to make sure the key was not damaged and we would have to wait longer. All in all a great experience from a bad situation. Thank you James in security X2-Six Flags Magic Mountain!! We will be back but without objects in our(my) pockets.",john_in_vegas22
30,Just OK,"We just got back from a day at this park. Like everyone says, the roller coasters can't be beat, however, there were many things that detracted from our visit. 1. Maintenance. You have to wonder how safe it all is when things look so run down. For example, water is dripping everywhere out of the Logjammer ride. A child was stuck in the Revolution roller coaster when the safety bar wouldn't release on only the second or third ride of the day, and they sent him around again to try to make it release but this didn't work. Finally I left the queue but heard from my kids the staff had used a crowbar to open it (!) 2. The smell. As another reviewer commented, several areas smell like a garbage dump. 3. The unbelievable queues. In the morning it was ""reasonable"" but after we queued from 2:30 to 3:30 to ride on the very average Logjammer we decided to call it quits and leave. 4. The exorbitant food prices and excessive gate security. Stash your sandwiches well and wrap them in film not foil (there is a metal detector and a very serious bag search on entry (not a pocket search, hint hint)). Also bring a bottle for free water from their fountains. All this is not to detract from their flagship rides. The kids had a great time on Green Lantern (40 min wait at about 11am) and we enjoyed several other less popular rides in the morning with little queuing. In total, the kids were satisfied but felt Universal Studios was better. My wife and I were both a little disappointed.",travellinman2112
40,Teenagers had a Blast,"Went to Six Flags Magic Mountain on a Saturday in July and had a blast. First, we pre-purchased the Plantium Flash Pass on-line prior to arriving. This was money well spent. This basically gave us a front of the line pass to all but X-2 and Green Lantern. If you wanted to ride those without waiting you could purchase a reserved time at a cost of $15 per person per ride extra. The Plantium also let us ride twice without getting off. With the Flash Pass we were able to get off of one ride and walk directly onto the next. The most we waited for our reservation time was 10 minutes. We were able to ride all the rides at least 4 times and were done by 6 pm and ready to go home.The park itself is in need of a lot of maintenance and cleaning. The bathrooms were really run down and it didn't seem as though it did not have a dedicated employee to the restrooms as they were dirty at times. Food prices were high, but they are all all of these types of parks.Upon leaving the park at 6 pm there were six police cars stationed directly in the front. Also as the day progressed it seemed as though more gang-type young kids arrived and I would suggest younger children not be left without parental supervision after dark.We would go again,Tips: Purchase the Flash Pass prior to arrival; wear really good shoes as there is a lot of walking up and down hills; leave before dark; dont' brother to bring food it will be taken away.",Professor Janet
40,Great fun for Thrill Seekers,"Park was relatively clean. Areas of the park had a smell of garbage or puke, but no park is like Disneyland. Yes there are many teens and young adults at the park who do not have model behavior. They flock to Magic Mountain for the unlimited thrill rides. The focus of the park is Thrill Rides! My 13 year old son rode every roller coaster in one day. We went on a Monday. Arrived prior to gates opening. Ran to X2, then Tatsu and waited less than 30 minutes. After that the wait was 1.5-2 hours. Most lines were positioned in the shade. We had a great time and would return.",AZTrailBlazer
40,Flash pass platnuim is the only way to go!,"Went mid week in summer, school buses and charter buses should have done us in but we paid $175 for a two people flash pass... and although it was way too expensive we got to go on all the rides some over 4 times, and do everything we wanted to in 8 hours... it even lets you ride twice so you just raise when you have finished the ride and you go again... Boy the looks you get are awesome... pure jelousy. so when everyone else is standing in the hot sun for over an hour per ride, you just breeze right through.Tips... bring food, all places to eat panda express, bbq, johnny rockets all charge upwards of 11.99 for a basic meal. also sodas are over 5 bucks annd even machines are 3.75, lockers start at 11 bucks but go up to 30. the place gets super hot, lots of up hills so wear good shoes and sunscreen. I had a great time the X2 is the best coaster i have ever been on...",Christinetwo
50,Excellent!!!!!! best theme park if you are a rollercoaster lover!,"I loved loved loved this park! It´s just amazing. If you are a roller coaster lover, this is a MUST for you!! So much fun! So many roller coasters!!! Just can´s get enough.",Chefmariela
30,"The best roller coasters, but everything else...","It is a shame that the caliber of the roller coasters at this thrill-seekers mecca cannot be matched by the surrounding park. The lines are often much too long, mostly because the maintenance refuses to run for trains, even on some of its most crowded days. The coasters are the only way to get excited for whatever is ahead of you, because the rest is just dull. The staff is never fun: not exactly mean or rude, but its obvious they do not care about their jobs. Bottom line: you will never catch anyone smiling unless they are riding something, and the entire park just does not place the customer first, which should be their top priority.",BenjaminOdom
40,Roller Coaster Heaven,"Buy your tickets online or find their promotions on Coke cans! You will always pay less than at the gate even for parties over 10. We went with kids aged 9-14; all had a full day's worth of fun. The 2 teens in the group LOVED the high-thrill coasters at this Six Flags although some lines were over 1 1/2 hours long. We were there the entire day and didn't have time to ride all the extreme coasters because of wait times, but the rides we went on were unique and fun. Food is super expensive, so don't come hungry and definitely buy the refillable drink cup. Overall, we are glad we invested one day of our limited vacation here.",Craig O
50,The King of Roller Coasters.,"Magic Mountain is for coasters and not much else. They have a small kids area and a few shows, but it is a Thrill Park! Cedar Point and SF Great Adventure are only two parks that come close. X2 is the best steel coaster I have been on, back seat. Tatsu, Superman and the new Green Lantern are great. The landscaping is quite nice and the views and vistas of the surrounding mountains from top of the rides are fabulous.You need a Gold Flash Pass most days to really enjoy yourself, but the price is not bad. A season pass is only $59.If you need a stragedy, here is my best one. Get to the park before it opens and get a spot near the gate. If you have a discover card, you will get in 5 minutes early due to a special line. This is HUGE, trust me, but not neccesary. Once in, run like an idiot before you get trampled to X2. The Discover people will already be there. After a 10 minute wait for the back seat, yes not the front, you then need to walk back to the Flash Pass centre. It is the building you ran by just after entering the gates. Here you will line up for about 30 minutes and buy a Gold pass. Regular is too long of wait and Platinum just wastes your money as you need a teleporter to use the no wait function. If you really liked X2, you can now buy another ride for $15 or wait for over 2 hours later in the day if you choose.You now need to program Goliath on your pass while you walk over to Green Lantern for your longest wait of the day. After an hours wait due to no flash pass function, you will ride GL, but it was worth it. Ok, now the easy part. Go on your Goiliath reservation and then just reserve your rides as you work your way around the park with minimal waits for every ride. You'll do them all, barely, and most of your time will be walking to each ride. At least your getting into shape. Have fun.",ArgoZ
10,Horrible! Plan to spend a lot of extra $ just to ride the coasters!,"Impossible to try all the thrill rides without forking out for a flash pass, which costs more than the park admission. Long lines, no security, and they make you pay an extra $1 per ride for a locker if you happen to have a backpack, purse, or water bottle.",Voltron360
40,Great rides but can be spendy!,"When purchasing your ticket do NOT buy it at the park, you will be paying premium price. Check on-line through the Six Flags website and print your tickets before arriving, this is the easiest- done this in the past! OR in our case this time, we purchased our ticket through the front dest of our hotel at 50% off each!Upon arrival at the park we were able to go through another ""special"" entrance for DiscoverCard holders- this line was a shorter than the ""general public"" gates. You just need to show your ticket that was purchased on Discover or flash your DiscoverCard. There is no limit to the amount of people in your group- so if you have 25 people in your group and one of you has a DiscoverCard you can all go!Our family of 4 made our visit here BEFORE the summer rush! Thank goodness, we did not need to purchase the flashpass which would have been a waste during the time of our visit so that saved us a bundle of money. The only line we waited in was our first ride X2, we figured we had better get on early so we headed straight there. That wait was almost 2 hours because they had not opened the ride yet and were still running tests on the track, worth the wait! All the other rides were only about a 15-20 minute wait. This park is definitely not for everyone, if you love rollercoasters and thrill rides you will love it here. My husband and son enjoyed it most. Unfortunately I think age has gotten the better of me so I can no longer ride as many of the coasters as I used to in my younger days and my daughter has never been a fan of rollercoasters- Disney definitely suits my daughter and I better. This park is not well suited to smaller children because of obvious height requirements and also because most kids younger than 8 or even 10 are not ""thrillseekers"" and adrenaline junkies.Remember to have dollar bills as you will need to store your items in lockers- purse, sunglasses, shoes etc. You can not have loose items on the rides, rides do not have storage pouches. If you are wearing flip-flops/slippers/thongs OR any type of slip on shoe or mules I recommend you put them in the locker- don't try to sit on them thinking they will be safe & tucked away. We saw several people loose them, my son was one of them! We had to purchase a pair of flipflops from one of the shops, an easy $20 down the tubes! I commented to the sales guy that he must make a mint off of park visitors because of lost shoes and he agreed whole -heartedly!If you plan on riding the wet rides, BRING EXTRA CLOTHES! You'll be a much happier camper! The entire group that was with us on Roaring Rapids got completely soaked. Don't think you'll come out dry, chances are highly unlikely!Meals at the park are spendy- I don't think there is really a way around it since you can't bring outside food in. A frozen lemonade was $7. Our lunch was about $15-20 per person, that was the cheap side, typical cafeteria food.Most of the staff was very friendly and helpful with any questions we had.Overall we had a great time and we'll be back again to check out the new rides!",diamondleo
20,Needs a fresh coat of paint.,"The park is in desperate need of attention from the beautification committee. Paint is chipping off most of the buildings, doors look like they have been gnawed on by termites. The rides are great with the exception of one. Scream is probably the smoothest roller coaster ride I have ever been on. Viper on the other hand made my ears feel like I had gone a couple of rounds with Tyson!! I did the online one day ticket, which cuts the price in half. I would not pay any more than this admission. Obviously the profits are to line the pockets of the owners and not towards a gallon of Glidden to update tweety bird.",Chesha14
20,Fantastic... if you have lots of money!,"Yes, I have to admit it: the rides ARE absolutely fantastic. Apart from getting stuck upside down in Tatsu for 20 minutes. But I digress.This park has a lot to offer BUT the wait time killed the best spirit out of us. Prepare to line up (even in ""low season and week days"") first for the security gate (they will turn you away if you have any trace of food in your bag - how do they deal with people with allergies?!) then line up to get your on-line tickets printed for 45 minutes. Before you can enter the park. Try explaining this to kids.Then, prepare to line up for several hours for each ride... unless... wait a minute. You can pay an extra $100 per person to get a Platinum Flash Pass and skip the line - without guilt! But since that was $400 for our family, we opted for the middle ground ""Gold Pass"" at a mere extra $160 to save the day and cut the waiting time down by 50%. Since we're Canadian, we still felt guilty at cutting the line for a price - how wrong is that??!!Still, once you get on those rides, it is truly show time. The kids (age 10 and 12) were absolutely delighted and thrilled. The trick is actually getting ON the rides. Prepare for LOTS of walking. The park is definitely tailored to teenagers but there is lots to do with younger kids too. Particularly if they're 54"" or taller.The food is aweful and extremely expensive (did I mention that you cannot bring your own food either?). Our conclusion is that Six Flags understaff the park on purpose so that there are line ups EVERY WHERE (so you get used to it, I guess). Money wise (and health wise), it's a rip off, but then again everybody had (eventually) a good time and wants to go back. So let's start saving for it baby!",SEdaca
50,"Fun park, lots of thrills","Early May visit on a Sunday, was not too busy so didn’t need to purchase the flash pass (it may be best to make this call once you’ve entered the park). Was a lot of fun, plenty of thrills to entertain everyone. X2 is a must do, it is unreal!!!",Matthew C
40,Great place for coaster lovers,"This park has one of the best coasters ""X2"" where riders are on the sides of the track and rotate independently of the actual track. If you are looking for theming, this amusement park has very little of it, but is expected of a Six Flags park.",Dennis B
50,Unbelievable Service!,"I took a group of 230 to Six Flags for our grad night trip from Utah. One of the girls lost her backpack with all of her money, phone, camera, Everything! After we left the people at Six Flags found the bag and had our four tour buses pull off the freeway so they could deliver it to us! That is incredible! Everything was still in the bag and a young girl's trip was saved!",1greatmomoffour
50,One of the best amusement parks in the United States,"I only went 2 times, but even that was enough to see that it was totally awesome. While somewhat costly (but TOTALLY worth it), the over 18 roller coasters are enough to keep you busy for the whole day. Not one of their coasters are not worth the wait. I strongly suggest you go there if you are near Valencia anyway.",JamesClift
50,"Great Family Park, Rides & Service","Our family of 4, including 2 teenage boys, had a great time at Six Flags Magic Mtn. We purchased tix, parking and souvenir cups on online. We arrived 10 minutes prior to opening. Parking attendants were on the ball. Got 3rd row parking at that hour. Stood at entrance with a few hundred others and we all entered the park within minutes and without incident.Lines were few at the early hours. Was able to ride the thrill rides, viper, x2, Goliath and Scream a few times each without too long a wait, max 5 - 10 minutes each. After lunch there was the typical 2 hour wait. All was good.Food: Pricey, but you already knew that so don't complain. Decent portions, nothing special but satisfies your appetite. Like eating at the mall.Bathrooms were attended to frequently. All in all, restrooms were CLEAN and CONVENIENT to all parts of the park. Lines for women were near food venues. Will every woman would keep their toilet area clean and clean up after their kids? My husband said he's seen worse Men's restrooms.Security was everywhere. Obvious, not obvious. We felt very comfortable. We purposely asked anyone who worked there ""where or what"" about the park and each employee took the time to explain or show. We met not one rude employee.We were a bit hesitant to go to THIS park because of previous online reviews and its age, but we were pleasantly surprised and look forward to going again before the boys graduate!",FellowTaveler
50,OMG the RIDES!! .... but don't forget your Flashpass!,"Okay so our last day in the US and we were stuck on what to do. I did a little googling and found this place! After stalking the reviews we realised it could be worth the hour drive up (we were staying in Anaheim) and give it a go. So like the others suggested here on Tripadvisor, we opted for the Gold Pass and went on what seemed like THE busiest day ever, Memorial Day. When we first arrived we were greeted with the masses at the gates (not the ticket gates, but the gates to enter the park). After queuing just to get in the gates and then queuing to get the passes (that took 1/2 hour), we thought the day was going to be doomed. But we were soon proven wrong. The Gold Pass was UNBELIEVABLE! Longest 'wait' after we reserved was 20 minutes but for most it was instant. Not sure I could suggest doing this park without the pass on a busy day. This was our last day in the US and I have to say, out of all the parks we went to on the West Coast, this place rocked. Like another advisor said, do yourself a favour, dip into your pockets and you won't regret it.",MrsOZ77
50,Wow!,"Most intense, wide ranging collection of coasters I've experienced! Went on a Spring break Saturday and it was very very busy - so opted for Platinum passes - not cheap but we were visiting all the way for the UK so I could just about justify them. Worth every penny - meant we had standby times on about 4 mins for every ride - even though they were averaging over 2 hours for the big ones - plus you could stay on the rides for 2nd go. The passes meant we never had to run about like headless chickens and constantly panicking which lines to get into next - it led to a really mellow chilled out day. If you are flying across the world - and it's even marginally busy - take a deep breath - put your hand in your wallet and buy the passes - it really is worth every penny and made our day.We were really looking forward to the park - and although a bit wary of some reviews - it really did exceed expectations - great atmosphere - loads of people having fun - much better landscaping than we expected - and great staff. The crowd were mostly teenagers having a great day out - and I have to say I never saw a single bit of trouble all day.We followed the tip of being there early and running to x2 as soon as the gates opened. Got in line - opened 10 mins later and we were on the 2nd car of the day. Amazing ride - best coaster in the world? Certainly the best one I've been on. When we exited the queue was so long it snaked back miles past the ride entrance and up the paths into the park - easily hitting 2-3 hours within 20 mins of the ride opening! That run was worth it.Would I recommend the park? In a heartbeat!",NTHurrrzz
50,The best theme park in LA,22 of us decended on Magic Mountain and had a fantastic day. The only ride we queued for over an hour was X2 but it was well worth it. All other rides were less than 30 mins. Def worth a visit.,Pollyflanders
50,This place is awesome,"This place is awesome, I went to California for my birthday to go to Six Flags. I'm originally from the Midwest and they are known for having the best amusement park in the country ""Cedar Point"" . I love roller coasters and I knew that Six Flags and Cedar Point had been competing with each other for awhile for the best thrill rides. Well this place is definitely giving Cedar Point some competition . Six Flags has some of the most amazing rides I ever rode. Superman was by far my favorite, X2 was also pretty amazing. I went on Friday and Monday and bought the platinum flash pass plus the pass to get on x2. Yeah it may cost close to an extra hundred dollars not including your ticket but it is totally worth it. When you buy the platinum fast pass not only do you get to skip the line, but they will also let you stay on the roller coaster for a second ride. Hey you may get alot of mean looks from people in line, but it is totally worth it.. I went with friends on Friday , but after riding 3 or 4 coasters they were too tired, so I went back by myself on Monday bought the platinum and rode every good roller coaster in the park at least twice. I would not recommend going to the park without buying the platinum, the lines are extremely long and you will waste all your day standing in line. Even food takes a pretty long time, I waited over 45 minutes for a turkey leg and the same for my friends at Panda, this would have been on good Friday so maybe that's why. I have been to almost every amusement park in the country and this one is definitely up on the list.",LacySpikes
50,"Amazing, loved every minute, get there when it opens!","We decided to go to six flags whilst in Orange County, as we were bored with our Disneyland pass (really is for little kids). So it was a 1.5 hour drive, but was totally worth it. We got there just after it opened, and went straight to X2 as we were told to get the 2 longest waits out of the way first, which was a great tip. But there was a problem with X2 the day we went, so the line was on the walkway when we got there. Luckily they fixed it up, and it was a streamline directly to the inside, with only approx 60 ppl in front of us. The wait was still about 1 hour in total, but that was ok. X2 is out of control, best coaster we have been on ever, so scary. Hubby had the GoPro harnessed on during the ride, you tube video is up, awesome. Next we went to Viper, walked straight on, good coaster. We then went to find Tatsu as we heard the lines were big for that too, prob waited 35 minutes. All the rest were either walk ons or like 10 minutes, so that was great. We went on a monday, during spring break.Food is reasonable in the park, but in our opinion everything is cheap in the US food wise compared to Australia.Parking costs $15 once there, but we spend hundreds on parking, so whatever!We left at 6ish, and rode every coaster that was there only once. Would have loved a second day there, but no time. We paid $37 each to get in, which we thought was a steal.HIghly recommend this park for any coaster lovers, dont bother if you are more the bag holder haha. Oh and sucks that you have to pay $1 each time to put your stuff in a locker, very annoying and really does add up!Will def go back when in LA!!",MissRAust
50,Best Rides in the world!,"I went to college in California and kept telling my New York raised kids how great the rides were (mind you that was 20 years ago). So we took a trip for Spring Break to Magic Mountain and they absolutely LOVED it. We spent 2 days there, wish we spent more and did as many coasters as we could. Tatsu was our favorite (7 loops!), we were hoping Green Lantern would be open. We also enjoyed the Collasus, Batman, Scream, Ninja, Goliath and Apacolypse. We arrived on a Sunday after flying straight from New York, that was our best weather day and least crowded. Monday was more crowded, cloudy and cool, but we still had an awesome time. We went to Disney, Knott's Berry Farm, Universal, & the San Diego Zoo as well and Six Flags was BY FAR the fave for my 9 and 13 year old girls! Can't wait to go back! The only draw backs were the crowds on Monday, but they were manageble and the fact that I couldn't use my season pass parking at a different park (aparently that's new this year??)",barlow_ctb
50,Good fun!,"Lots of roller coasters here! Wear good shoes and there are some hills around the back side of the park. When you enter go towards X2 then proceed around the park in a clockwise circle and you will avoid the biggest uphill. Be sure to buy your ticket on line before hand for $31, good value. Bring your own food in a cooler and eat lunch outside the park in your car (many people do this!) Food inside the park is very expensive. A few rides seemed that they needed some TLC, however, the walkways were clean and employees were abundant. T-shirts were reasonably priced in the stores and AAA members get a discount.",Happy_Traveller0523
50,Had a blast,"Excellent value for money, we went just before spring break during the week. The longest que we had to deal with was 20 minutes. in saying that If I was going during a busy period I would invest in a flash past to save waitnig in line. We had a great day even when it started snowing! We will be going here again.",jfp1711
50,The Flash Pass is a Must!,"First off, I have to say that I was a little hesitant about going to this park with my family. 15 years ago was the last time I visited Magic Mountain, and the demographics were less than desirable. It seemed as if, during that time, is was mostly a teenage hangout. I am happy to report that we were there this time for 3 days, this time with my children, and the demographics were much better.We arrived late in the afternoon on Sunday, and visited the park for a few hours. It was not crowded at all, and the longest wait was for X2, which was about 40 minutes.Monday seemed a little more crowded. I have to comment again on the demographics. There seemed to be more families than teenagers hanging out, and the overall atmosphere was the best experience I have ever had at any theme park. The employees were helpful and extremely friendly.We ended up buying the plantinum flash pass, which in my opinion, really wasn't worth it. ( The gold seemed like the best value). We did get to ride 2x on each ride, which was the biggest bonus. However, once we were in the flash pass entrance, and an employee checked us in, we would then reserve another ride, and the buzzer would go off while we were standing in line. (For those of you that aren't familiar with the system, the plantinum flash pass takes off 90% of the rides wait time; the gold takes off 50% of the wait time, and the regular doesn't reduce the wait time, it just reserves your place in line, so you can finish riding one ride, walk to the the other ride, and pretty much only wait 5-10 minutes depending on the line.)The 2nd day was a little different. The demographics completely changed, and the middle-class family seemed to be in the minority. I don't know if we didn't get the memo, or there was a special discount going on, but it seemed different. Nothing like 15 years ago, but not like the day before. This day was A LOT more crowded! We decided to try the Gold flash pass today. That thing was fantastic. Other than not being able to ride each ride 2x, it didn't seem any different. We never had to wait to get on any ride, and the park was a lot busier than the day before.My summary: if you are worried about demographics because of some of the other previous posts, don't be. It seems as if they park's management is doing a good job keeping the ""riff-raff"" out. GET THE FLASH PASS. It is completely worth the money.",LVCoasterFamily
40,Great value - better than expected - great for teens,"My wife and I visited Six Flags with 4 teens on Sunday March 27. We bought the online admission tickets ahead of time for about $35 each and we got there about 1/2 hour before the gates opened. This time of year it was opened on weekends only.After reading all the reviews here I did not have very high expectations but we had a great time. Like most visitors that day we did not buy any special flash passes. Thankfully there were not many people using the flash pass. I found that, except for X2, the lines were not excessive. By noon the paved parking lot was about 1/2 full. Here is the order we did the park and the wait times:X2 1.5 hour wait - short but impressive rideViper 20 minutes - 7 inversions - shorter wait for back seatsDejavu - closedApocalpse - reported 2 hr wait - we skipped this oneRevolution - 10 minTatsu - long wait - skipped this one - wife didn't like the looks of it.Raft ride 10 minRiddler - stand-up coaster - 45 minutesTidal Wave - 0 minutes - rode several timesBatman - 30 minutes - rode twice - front seats are worth a little extra waitScream - 15 minGoliath - 50 minutes - huge, fast coasterViper - 0 min wait at end of daySuperman - closedColossus - closedOverall it well worth the $35. The park and bathrooms were clean. Staff was fine. I didn't mind the waits since pretty well everyone was waiting. Food was a bit expensive but not excessive - cheese burger platter $11, chinese food including pop $11, etc. We spotted the funnel cakes near the exit at the end of the day. They looked great but we decided to go out for dinner instead. The only disappointment was the number of rides that weren't running.There is a good choice of restaurants nearby - after the park closed we hit Olive Garden which was excellent.",side-tripper
40,nice but pricey/long wait,very hyped up obviously but took us SO DAMN LONG to get on the rides. rides were fairly adequate once we were on them. not worth 2 hour wait though.,MichaelJT19
40,Great park great rollercoasters,"First thing is you don't need a car to get here, I stayed in the Wilshire hotel in Korea town in LA. Get on the subway to union station ($1.50) then get the train headed for Lancaster but get off at Santa Clarita ($17.50) and from there get a taxi to the park ($10-$15). Into the park its about $40 which I think is worth it, I went in April so the lines weren't really long got to go on everything I wanted to. All the rides were great fun I don't have anything to complain about. The roller coaster X2 is the best it is a must.",killbot2000
50,"Yes, It's pricey but the Platinum Flash Pass was worth it.","The GF and I went to SFMM on 2/26. It was a Saturday and the weather was a little cold so it was actually quite empty.Despite how empty it was we splurged for the Platinum Flash Pass. Many will say that it is not worth it but doing some simple math made me think otherwise.--We were able to do in a few short hours what would take others 2-3 visits.We rode 21 rides. All of which were the major coasters. We were able to ride each major coaster at least twice and some up to 4 times.Goliath X4Tatsu X4Scream X2Batman X2Ridder's Revenge X2Revolution X2Viper X2X2 (Once)Apocalypse (aka Terminator Salvation) X2The missing ones were closed (Superman-not opened, Ninja, Collossus)With the Platinum Flash Pass they were all walk ons or with minimal waits.We got to the park right at opening and left at 5:00 PM. We could have done more but we were tired. We also spent about 2 hours browsing the shops and eating. There was never any wait and getting to ride back to back made us get a lot more done in a shorter amount of time. If you are short on time and will be only visiting for a day believe me, you want to get the Platinum Flash Pass. People did get aggravated and pissed that they had to sit out one more ride rotation but they could have purchased the Flash Pass if they wanted too. No lines. Get to ride twice.Wear cargo pants or have a fanny pack that you can wear under a large shirt or hoodie. This will save you from having to spend money on lockers.Take as many pictures with as many of the photographers. You do not have to purchase them all but if you purchase just one single picture, they give you a card in which you can go online and view the pictures. A little knowledge of photoshop and you will be able to print out and develop the pictures yourself for a fraction of the cost.Another piece of advice is to use a Discover Card. Prior to the park opening the general public was forming a pretty long line at the main gate. There is a Orange Carpet line and there must have been no more then 10 people. They opened this line before the main line which gave everybody who got in this few minutes early a head start to X2 which is not included in the Flash Pass--its $15 more on top of the Flash Pass price to reserve a time on X2People may grumble about lines, how the park is a mess, and how the punk kids are running rampant over the place. I never felt that way at any time. I paid for the privledge of skipping all of the lines and riding twice and it was well worth it.",fake808sports
10,Epic Disappointment!!!,"This was my third and probably final visit to a Six Flags park judging from how they have gone downhill (pardon the pun) at Magic Mountain anyway. From the 1 - 1.75 hour lineups, to the filthy, smelly bathrooms, to the outrageous food prices, to the rides that are ""closed due to maintenance"" , to the rides that have only have 2 trains running while there is a 1 - 1.75 hour lineup, where do I begin to tell you about the epic disappointment that is now Magic Mountain. For a family of 4, I doubt that many if any can afford flash passes that basically let you ""cut into line"" as I know I cannot afford those prices to do that. Funny how they tell you all over the park that cutting into line is grounds for ejection from the park, but if you pay to cut into line with a flash pass, it is perfectly fine with them. Since the park was closed Mon - Fri and only open on weekends since New Years, I would expect to see all or most every ride running with every available train and instead found several rides closed or like on Tatsu, Viper, Scream, etc the trains were not being used because we were told they were ""out for maintenance"" even though they looked quite dusty and hadn't been used in a while. The state of the some of the buildings was also abysmal as I remember sitting across from a Johnny Rockets having a shake and looking at this rotting fascia board falling off the building but having what looked like a fresh coat of paint on it. I could go on a lot longer but I think you get the idea. It is really too bad that the owners/management cannot run this place better as the rides really are great if you can ever get on one!!!",dman1264
10,Don't Waste Your Time!,"My husband and I went to Six Flags Magic Mountain on March 12, 2011 for our anniversary. We're really into roller coasters. We drove all the way from Utah and were anticipating a good time. The lines were horrible! To ride a 2 minute roller coaster the waits were 1.5-2 hours long. It was so frustrating and crazy. People kept getting in the wrong line (the flash pass line) but didn't have a flash pass and the staff would let them ride first anyway. We were there for six hours and only got to ride 2 of the bigger coaster and about 4-5 kieddie rides because the lines were so long. I was so dissapointed. I went for t he big rides and couldn't even get on them. The flash pass prices were outrageouse. For the middle flash pass it was $60 per person on top of the $35 per ticket we already spent and half of the big rides were closed so it just wasn't worth it. For having so many rides closed, you'd think they would give you some money back. I will never go there again or reccommend it to anyone. The food prices were outrageous too! I get theme parks charge more but this place charges a ton more.",rtobyn
40,"Once again, it was worth the visit","We first came here in 2008 and visited within 3days of arriving in the USA and once again, we did so this time so I was still quite jetlagged (hubby wasnt)Was a warm day and was really really busy (unlike last time). BUT unlike this time, hubby was able to do all the roller coasters and once again his faves were X2 & Tatsu. I didnt go on anything as not a fan BUT he had a great time. Didnt stay for as long as we did last time as so very humid and still so very tired BUT had a great time once again. Happy hubby as no queue for Goliath which was shut when we visited in 2008 so he went on that over & over.And we will be back!!!!! Nothing like the real Wallyworld!PSIf you dont have a car, there is no other way to get here if staying near LA that takes less than 3hours",jhoppy01
50,The best amusement park I've ever been to,"If you are in Los Angeles make sure you do not miss Six Flags during your visit.It is amazing, it really is.All the rides are awesome, I bet you will scream like a 14 year old girl.You will experience speed, heights, extreme acceleration and so on.The place is clean, easy to get there and the food is OK.",Attis1
50,Hot but fun!,"If you love the feeling of adrenaline pumping through your body, this is the right place for you! Great roller coasters and other attractions, well worth the price, but of course during high season long waiting lines. Best months to visit: May and October. During summertime, stay hydrated!",tofuchs
40,Perfect for thrill seekers,"I've been to just about every other amusement park in California and said I would never go to Magic Mountain because the rides were too scary and the crowds to intimidating. BUT at the urging of a friend, who hadn't been in 20 years but really wanted to go, I planned a weekend trip from San Diego up to Magic Mountain. Like the other reviewers said, planning is key to a fun day. I brought lunch and kept it in the car. We arrived right at opening time so parked close enough to walk out, after getting a hand stamp. Although we were having so much fun it took us till 2:30 to go outside for lunch. I liked bringing lunch because I could be sure to have just what I wanted rather than paying a lot for limited choices. I felt safe, lots of security around, and bought the flash pass (WELL worth the money!!!) so didn't have to wait in any lines EVER (except the first one which convinced us to buy the flash passes). We went in December so the crowds were probably lighter than usual, lines were about 1 hour for most rides and 1 1/2 for X2. X2 was amazing but so was Tatsu and Batman (all kind of similar rides). I'd skip Scream, Revolution and Viper as got a bit banged up (ear bangers we called them). Because of the Flash pass we rode 10 rides in 6 hours. Took us 2 hours to figure out to buy the flash pass and rode only 2 rides in the first 2 hours (revolution 5 minute wait and X2 hour and half wait) and 8 rides in the next 4 hours. Flash pass is not overrated at all and made our day enjoyable. Stayed at Residence Inn in Burbank only 20 minutes/miles away which was the best Residence Inn I've ever stayed at, clean, new, good staff, good breakfast, comfortable bed, very roomy studio felt like an apartment. Ate next door at Black Angus and slept really well that night. Screamed more that day than I have in the whole year.",LBinCA
50,One of the best Parks,"Went on Sunday the 5th of December not very crowded rode X2 and Tatsu within 40 minutes of park opening and only a 5 to 10 minute wait for the other roller coasters. There was a little bit of rain on the day but that did not stop the rides, We had an enjoyable day and their park clothing is half the price of Disney, Food was ok and is expensive and the refillable drink bottle are great.",daz1963
50,A must for thrillseekers,"I went to Six Flags Magic Mountain in August when I was visiting the States with my family. Because our visit to Six Flags was completely last minute, we purchased regular tickets without flash passes. It was really crowded though and the average wait was about an hour per ride. Throughout the entire day, we managed to get on Tatsu, Scream, Revolution, Terminator Salvation, Viper and Ninja. Sadly we didn't have enough time for X2, Riddlers Revenge plus Superman was closed. But the rollercoasters we went on were AMAZING! Tatsu and Scream were the best! The food was also great and as was the facilities. Six Flags is Thrill Seekers pardise ;)",Rishi P
50,Awesome Roller Coaster Park this one!,"We had a great time - our (then) 11 Yr old son was really taken with the place. Yes - it is hard to get to...but worth it. We took an organised shuttle from Hollywood and the price was quite high, but we didn't regret a minute of our day. If you like roller coasters THIS IS HEAVEN!",Haydn M
30,"Good,but zero maintainance","We went to six flags on Nov 13th. The rides were great.Don't miss X2,but all water rides and superman,deja vu etc were closed. When I booked my tickets there was no information about that these rides were not available and we were disappointed. Another is that the restrooms were horrible and zero maintained.",ak2931
50,Family trip,"I took my family to six flags and all the adults had a blast I have four kids 7 ,5 ,3 ,2 and I think they might still be a little young and small for the rides.. so we will have to stay with Disney land for a few more years. But still go to six flags it was great.",64lark
20,Some great coasters - but a horrible park experience,"Ok - so the 1 hour queue for X2 was worth it and the park was very quiet so we didnt wait anywhere else.But - this park has the WORST customer experience I have every experienced. As you go in, the LA police department has its own residence there - so it was obvious what kind of day we were in for. Rides broke down often, ride attendants were messy (lots of swearing) and simply couldnt care less. Not enough carriages were running on each attraction causing lots of frustration.The park looks tired.Save your $ - go somewhere else.",musicmanbrain
50,Awesome for Roller Coaster Lovers!,"We went to SFMM on the Sunday before Fright Fest for my 30th birthday. I had always wanted to go to SFMM ever since I was about 10 years old, but living in the Midwest made that nearly impossible. Now that I'm living in AZ, I decided the perfect time to go would be for my big 30th birthday. We chose the perfect day to go. There were hardly no lines, not too many people there, and walked onto most coasters. SFMM is build on a mountain, so we ended up going the ""wrong way"" around the park and walking up the mountain. The scenery views from on top of the roller coasters is wonderful! X2 was a great roller coaster and I had never felt anything like it before. 2011 will bring another one-of-its-kind-in-North-America roller coaster, so I'm looking forwards to returning again in the future.",pilotgirl21
50,THE BEST THEME PARK IN CALIFORNIA,six flags magic mountain is my all time favorite park here in California . the reason i love it so much it is for its thriller roller coasters. they have a variety of roller coasters from Golliath to Tatsu . i recoMmend this park to everyone who like thriller rides. by the way make sure you try the funnel cakes they are delicious,lopez4592
50,Great Amusement Park with little crowd...,"We chose a great time for a visit to this amusement park. With the kids in school and it being October, we did very little waiting to ride on any of the rides. The Park was clean and all the staff seemed happy to be there and very helpful. As with most amusement parks, drinks and food were on the pricey side, but we went in knowing that. We plan to make Six Flags Magic Mountain and stop everytime we are in the area. We drove to Valencia from Costa Mesa on our trip and the hour and a half drive was well worth it.",IndyMedic2006
40,awesome coasters,We went on a Sunday at 1pm and the crowds were small. We were able to ride that were open by 6pm. We didn't go on some of the water rides. Wait times were less than 10 minutes. It looked like the kiddie land part was closed for the season and they didn't have any shows going on due to it being off season.,ironmnsar
50,Love the roller coasters!!!,"If you want to ride lots of different roller coasters, this is your amusement park! They have 16 different coasters of all types and kinds. From new fangled flying and twisting, turning action, to fun, smooth family type coasters, they have it all.",abczoo
40,A fun place to visit and spend the day at,"I had a great time at Six Flags Magic Mountain. They have a great selection of roller coasters and other ""intense"" rides like that. I went here with my family and we all had a great time. The lines are pretty long for all the good rides, so be prepared to spend lots of time waiting. The majority of the park is full of rides that are not very kid-friendly and have a height requirement to get on them. As such, I wouldn't really advise it as a place to take really young kids. They have a kid section, but outside that of that section they are just going to end up waiting on lines with you and not getting on the rides. Wear sunscreen!",madmeninaz
50,Get the platinum flash pass - expensive but worth every penny.,"Rollercoasters and more rollercoasters. Great theme park but unfortunately, they are unable to manage queues in this place. So, spend the extra money and get the Platinum (there is also a good and silver one available) flash pass. For a family of 4, this cost us an additional $307 but it was well worth it for a one-off visitor from overseas. The flash pass enabled us to jump the queues on all lines (except X2) and then ride it twice. What that means is after our ride is finished, we just sat still and went again. Very annoying for the queuers waiting to get on but fantastic for us. It meant we could do 20 rides around the park in the time it took regular customers to do 4, as the queues were 1 to 2 hours for each main ride.If your kids have outgrown Cinderella and Mickey Mouse, and like a few scary rollercoasters and water rides, take them to Six Flags Magic Mountain for a full, frenetic and exhilarating day out.",duncan_kirk
40,Great Fun!,"Just returning from our CA vacation, having spent one of our days at Magic Mountain. CA was experiencing record heat during our visit, so it was very hot and other than doing one of the water rides, there was hardly any relief. We arrived within the first hour of opening and experienced the ""long wait"" in line for the first ride. We then decided to spring for the fast passes and are glad we did! It cut down on the wait time considerably. For some rides it was a little difficult to find the entrance for fast passes. We ate in the park and we didn't think it was all that expensive for the amount of food they served. Be prepared to stand in long lines for food...too bad the ""fast passes"" didn't work there...LOL. My only criticisms would be that the park ran out of maps very early in the day, not sure why that happened, so we wandered around a lot until we could find someone to ask where things were located. I wish the park would install misters throughout, as that would have helped tremendously. For us ""over fifty"" crowd you definitely feel like the minority, as most everyone visiting the park seems teens to 30's. But all in all it was enjoyable and the rides were fantastic.",Steven K
50,For the Rollercoaster Lovers!,"This park is rollercoaster, after rollercoaster, after rollercoaster. We arrived for opening on a warm late July Saturday. We had pre brough tickets and parking online. Got the $35 tickets, nearly as much as the $15 fee for parking. We didn't buy into they overcharged flashpasses [Disney has the best verision -- FREE], we queued for some rides, others had no waits at all. We only bothered with the thrills coasters, best coasters of the day Tatsu and X2. Deja Vu is good aswell. Rides not for the large folk, Riddler's Revenge, Batman and one other I think. The guy in front of us, on Riddler's Revenge, threw up on himself, during the ride -- poor guy! Great day out!",emmaxoxo
50,Awesome!,SO MUCH FUN. Loved it. Went on a Wednesday in August and some of the rides had NO LINES. Bring your hat and drink lots of water as it can get hot and exhausting. Cant wait to go back.,charlieannepascoe
40,Rollercoasters are great.,"I'm a big rollercoaster and was looking forward to going to Magic Mountain. It had been about 15 years since my last trip there. My friends and I bought the VIP package. We had our own guide and had the VIP treatment of getting on the rides w/o having to wait. Our guide was great. Very nice, friendly and could tell she really enjoyed her job. The X2 ride was just incredible. I highly recommend riding it. Terminator Salvation is a great wooden coaster. My only issues with the park is a couple of the rides should be ""retired"". The Revolution is pretty old and really bangs you up. I have bruises from being bounced around. The Viper is cool but needs to be updated with better padding. It also bangs you around. The park itself was pretty clean. Overall had a great time.",ajfd
10,AVOID THIS HORRIBLE RIPOFF,"Avoid this terrible place. We went ther on a August day with an unberable temperature of 103 degrees.There are no benches or place to sit, ANYWHERE. The prices are outrageously expensive. It is a very long distance from he parking lot to the entrance. The attitude of the tram drivers is terribble. Customer service is not their focus. this place is one giant ripoff to be avoided at all costs.",rajonrondo
50,Wonderful Experience,"Traveling with a baseball team and the boys chose Six Flags rather than Disney. Ended up glad they did. It was clean, well staffed and the rides were better than expected. Spent the day and had a wonderful experience all around. Food was somewhat overpriced yet went in pretty much expecting that. There were lines for the women's restrooms most of the day yet there again that is fairly common. Bought the Fast Pass type tickets which seemed like a fortune but allowed bypass of lines where people waited several hours and we walked on without any waiting. We would return if ever back in the area.",MTfamily
40,If you buy the Flash Pass Platinum the park is great,"We just took our nephews there and spoiled them with the Flash Pass Platinum which gets you on the roller coaster without waiting in lines and lets you ride everything twice without getting off - they had a blast! However, the folk who were waiting in the 1 to 2 hour lines for each ride didn't look so happy. Our nephews usually go to six flags in New England and they said this park kicks butt over New England - tons more scary roller coasters including the new X2 which Magic Mnt says is the second best roller coaster in the country (apparently New Jersey has the best one...) Golieth has the second biggest drop in the country (I actually faded to black on that ride, which is apparently common for many riders - needless to say, I only rode it once...) Whatever you do - DO NOT go to Loose Moose for dinner - the staff were great but the food was horrible! Stick to the over-priced pizza or Panda Express... I also have to point out that there is a lot of ""attitude"" at this park - my kids are younger so I'm used to Disneyland (which apparently really is the happiest place on earth...) This park is geared more towards teenagers - enough said.",Fran S
50,Home of the best rollercoasters.,"We had a great day here. 5 friends invested in the flashpass. 3 got motion sickness pretty early on. My best mate and I and went on 12 rollercoasters and other rides. Fantastic day. I thought the flash pass was great, allowed us to get on the rides quickly and meant we could get the front seat ride on nearly all of the rides. Got the back seat ride on X2 and that was amazing.",Timothy C
10,"Lines, lines, everywhere there are LINES!!!!","We recently took our two children ages 11 & 13 to this amusement park. We were on an extended visit to Southern California. I have never had such an awful experience at an amusement park in MY LIFE! (Our family has been to many amusement parks!) Let me say that the cheap admission tickets are cheap for a reason, everything else in the park will cost and cost and cost you. Upon arriving RIGHT AWAY in the morning, we paid $15 to park and we were directed to a lot that was so far away that it was GRAVEL and their own tram did not even come out that far. We Arrived at 10am!!! Disney charges $15 to park, but they have better parking/tram service! After quite a hike, we got to the tram pick up and WAITED in a LINE that was 30-50 people deep. And that was just one of the 10-15 lines of people waiting to get on. They only had ONE tram running. We WAITED in that LINE for 20 minutes and had only seen one tram and we gave up and made the hike to the front gate...many others did the same. We went right to the admission gate and WAITED in a LINE for 45 minutes just to get in (we ALREADY had tickets, that was suppose to save us time??) After going through their security...every single security booth had buzzer alarms going off but I saw NO ONE actually being checked at all! UMMM........why have a security check point if they ignore the alarms? After FINALLY getting in we all went right to X2 only to find it had a TWO HOUR wait...on a Wednesday? We went to the Tatsu and again a 2 HOUR wait!!!! We went to the Scream and, YEP you guessed it, TWO HOUR WAIT!!! We finally resolved to get the platinum flash passes for our kids only as they really enjoy the roller coasters (so do we) and we wanted them to have a good time and we couldn't afford 4 platinum flash passes. So we go to the Flash Pass office and WAIT in a LINE that is 50-75 deep.....and the operators do not move too fast! Once you finally get into the room to buy the flash passes (or THINK you are ""in""), you are actually there to watch a video about how the flash passes work and are told repeatedly OVER AND OVER that the flash passes are non-refundable (I think I got it the first ten times I was told). After the 15 minute video, a flash pass representative comes in and AGAIN summarizes what the video said while repeating at least five more times that the flash passes were NON - REFUNDABLE (no kidding). So we fork out another $300 to get TWO flash passes, which of course DO NO WORK on the X2 unless you PAY an additional $15!!!!!! By this time my husband and I are fried, but our kids could not wait to get the flash pass and ride the coasters! Once we paid $300 for the flash passes, (they kept my drivers license) we took off to start riding. Even with the platinum flash pass, our kids WAITED up to 45 minutes for a ride.....the shortest wait was about 20 minutes.As for the bathrooms and concessions.......get ready to WAIT in LINE (seeing a theme here?). My husband did not have near the problem with the men's bathroom that I had with he women’s bathroom. This park needs to SERIOUSLY do something about the bathroom situation. There are not that many bathrooms in this park to begin with and they are not strategically placed at all. The women's bathrooms are BEYOND filthy and disgusting.........they are truly unsuitable. I never went to a women’s bathroom there where I did not have to WAIT in a LINE for 20-30 minutes just to use the toilet. Every time I did use the bathroom, I felt like I needed to soak in sanitizer afterwards. It was SOOOOOOOO gross. Also, the women’s bathrooms typically had 5 stalls in them, but I never found one that had more than 3 actual working toilets. Usually it was only two working toilets. To aggravate the women’s bathroom problem EVEN more was the fact that they ONLY had those motion censored paper towel dispensers and there was typically 3 in each bathroom, but usually there was only ONE that worked! I went to one bathroom that NONE of the paper towel dispensers worked! So I would WAIT in LINE just to get a paper towel. I would also venture to guess that there is some serious drug use going on in the bathroom. I saw many, many, many, women going into stalls and not come out for over 15 minutes. Many times two or more would go into one little stall together. When they came out (15 minutes later!) they would be sniffling their noses with their fingers like they just snorted something! Also, the smell of pot was OBVIOUS in the bathrooms. There were ALWAYS Six Flags employees in the lines and using these bathrooms too and IGNORING all these problems!Again, there are seriously line issues at any of the concession stands! Lines were 10-15 deep ALWAYS. I didn’t find this to be a particularly crowded day, I just don’t think they have very motivated staff there. They must get sloppy seconds staff that Disney and Universal would not hire. We went to the Panda Express for lunch and had to WAIT in LINE for over 30 minutes. There were no clean tables anywhere and ALL and I mean ALL the nearby garbage cans were FULL, overflowing, and garbage was piled up all around them. It was really, really gross. They OBVIOUSLY had not been emptied ALL DAY and possibly not emptied from the day before from I what I could tell from the stank! EEEWWWWWWW! After we finally got our lunch, I could not find any napkins anywhere, even though the person who got us our lunch directed me to a condiment table that was SUPPOSE to have them. BIG SUPRPRIZE… all the napkin dispensers were EMPTY. I went back and had to WAIT in LINE to get napkins. When I finally got to the window, the person behind the counter again pointed me to the table even though I just told him there were NO napkins there. I asked AGAIN and he had to ask another guy standing next to him (who was TEXTING on his cell phone) to go in the back in get some napkins. Unbelievable….there is obviously no standards for even a minimal amount of customer service at this place, period.Also, get ready to be BOMBARDED with advertisements no matter where you go. In the bathrooms there were posters from a variety of things like....Lysol (too bad they don’t use it), in the park there were posters for things like beef jerky and lawn care services, and on the music speakers you could hear radio type advertisements for everything under the sun. WOW.I could go on and on…but I think you are getting the picture. It’s not a pretty picture either.I have to add this note, because I really wished someone would have warned me about this……..if you are white, you will be in the MINORITY here. We spent all day waiting for our kids to go on and get off rides and we counted less then 10 white families that we there. I am sorry, but it made me really uncomfortable. Many of the other park goers were teenagers or young adults. I did not see many families of any origin. But even fewer white families. Once it was dark, it was really scary. The last ride my kids went on was the Goliath ride. This seems to be a large “hang-out” type place with what appeared to be gang activity going on. AGAIN…the smell of pot everywhere. No Six Flags Satff anywhere in sight even though there were FIGHTS going on. SERIOUSLY. SCARY. My kids were in line by themselves and I was WORRIED about them waiting in the line. After that ride we left really fast like. We waited for the tram and asked if there would be security available to escort us to our vehicle, since the tram only took us through the first 3 parking lots and we were in lot 6! The security office said no. NIIIIIIICE.All and all……I wish we would have never gone and I would NEVER, EVER recommend to anyone to go there, EVER. If you do, leave before dark!",M0MinMINNES0TA
50,A Great Day!,"My 14 year old son and I were in California on vacation and planned a day at Magic Mountain because of all the coasters. We were very pleased with the experience. First of all, we went on a Monday at the end of July. We bought our tickets on line for $35 each. I was prepared to buy Flash Pass Gold, but we didn't need it. We were waiting right up front when the park opened and we rushed directly to X2 (which was totally amazing!!). They weren't quite ready to go, so it took about 15 minutes. From there to Tatsu, again a short wait. From there we went from coaster to coaster with never more than 10 minutes in line! All in all we rode 13 coasters (and the merry go round) in about 6 hours. Here is our rankings of the coasters (unfortunately Superman was not open):X2 (#1 with a bullet! Like nothing else!)GoliathTerminatorScreamBatmanTatsuDeja VeCollususViperRiddler's RevengeGoldrusherThe food was expensive, but all in all a great day and a very good value. Give it a try.",BigCLittleC
40,Great Rides but Misleading Prices and Terminator Let Down,"My friend and I decided to hit up Six Flags this summer because we thought that their buy one get one with the soda cans was a good deal. However, while the price of admission into the park is relatively inexpensive ($29.99...just a couple dollars less than Knotts), they definitely get you everywhere else.Parking is $15 and you are not allowed to bring any of your belongings through the roller coaster lines in order to leave them in the loading area. Instead, you have to pay $1 per roller coaster to rent a locker that is only good for 2 hours. This adds up quickly, especially since I wear glasses and was not allowed to have them on any rides (I ended up sneaking my stuff onto Goliath twice....I thought it was pretty dumb not being allowed to take my stuff on that ride...the same goes for Terminator). I think I ended up spending about $20 in locker fees that day. So the park ended up costing $95 plus food for 2 people. Still not a bad price for the thrill rides available in the park, but it is definitely misleading with advertising admission as $20.The food is very expensive! A hot dog and fries was over $10! I think the best deal for food at the park is the Moose lodge. It's an all you can eat buffet for $15. As far as water is concerned, one trick I learned is that the food places must give you a cup of water if you ask. My friend told me it is a law in California, and sure enough, if we were thirsty we would just find a food station and ask for a cup of water (however we did find that several stations were ""out"" of water cups, but overall we had some pretty decent success in that area).We also didn't end up buying the insanely expensive flash pass. We decided to go on a Tuesday and found the lines pretty reasonable. Goliath, Scream, Batman, and Riddler were all walk-ons. X2 and Tatsu had the longest waits at about 45 minutes (which is still not bad considering that they average about 2 hours). Ironically, the longest wait was DejaVu, which we ended up skipping because it was over an hour wait.Terminator has the worst line set-up I have ever seen! We waited over 30 minutes to go on that ride, all because 10 minutes of it consisted of watching videos in 3 separate rooms. It was really frustrating seeing that some of the coasters were not filled with a 30 minute wait, because everyone was forced to watch the videos. Even at night, when the roller coaster could have been a walk-on, it still took 10 minutes to get through the line....some coasters only had 4-6 people in them! We ended up asking the attendant if we could just stay in the loading area and ride again...fortunately she said yes to us, but I had heard her say no to a different group....guess you needed to catch her in the right mood.I still really enjoy the rides at this park, I just wish the some of the rides were managed better and that they did not require you to rent $1 lockers at every ride. Knott's provides free cubbies at every loading area, so at least the $32 entrance price is legitimate!",ockat88
40,Great time for the family,"We made our first visit as a family to Magic Mountain in mid-July. We had been there before kids about 20 years ago. I had read reviews about the park not being as clean and a bit worn. I had some reservations when we entered and you were required to go through metal detectors and empty your pockets. But once inside it was very clean, safe and a great experience. They have put a huge effort into park cleanliness and you see signs and reference to their focus on it throughout the park. Maybe they stepped it up based on previous feedback. I have kids who are 10 and 12, perfect age for roller coasters and theme parks. We did it all in a day (not the water park) and loved it. The lines were longer from 11-3 and the food is typical theme park fare. You could probably leave and go get a good lunch at a local restaurant and come back when the lines are shorter for the evening. Discount tickets through AAA saved us $8 each and we felt it was a great value for the money. Tons of fun and I'd recommend it if you want to have a great time with your kids!",gottogetaway2day
50,Great Experience - Highly Recommended,"We are a family of 4 with 2 pre-teens, both old enough to ride everything. We arrived the night before and stayed at the Holiday Inn express 3 min from the park (love the good rates, free parkng, free internet, free breakfasts of the Holiday Inns). The next morning we arrived when the gates opened (Wed Aug 4) at 10:30, and left at 6pm. Great park, crowds/lineups were light, weather was hot, staff were friendly, park was very clean. The FlashPass is essential (we bought Platinum) and with it, we were able to hit every major roller coaster in the park. We brought our own water into the park, and found that food and drink prices weren't as ridiculous as others had posted (although are bit higher which is typical in a theme park). We also found every restroom has a waterfountain and every concession stand would refill your water bottles upon request.",FamilyTravellers2008
10,I love roller coaster but I for one know...,"I love roller coaster but I for one know six flags is an amusement park not a theme park. Going to magic mohntain I understand why. I try to make the best out of a bad situation so I will say some of there rides are really good. Ride opps move extremely slow but it's all on purpose to have you by a flash pass and that alone is so sad. Ok, it's a good deal to come to the park all year long with a season pass but it's not like they have three or four trains running on there busy days. They want you to stand and the sun and bake until 350 degrees or golden brown so you can cough up the extra cash. Disney does it for free, (goces u a time to come back) but of course we all know magic mountain is no Disney. Well... That's y I dnt give them an extra dime once I get the season pass...i rather crawl to the water fountain before buying n e thing else there",SxcyMike
40,6 Flags - too much in price and size for one day - July 2010,"Great amusiment park but too big for one day. Line-ups were 1-2 ours after one and a half hours of opening, and we were there at opening. 17 roller coasters, 9 of which are extreme. Food is very expensive, you can't take ANY food through and they check everything at the gate. Lockers are available at each extreme ride for a fee. We printed coupons for Stride Gum and our family of five paid child price of $34.95 US each instead of $59.95 each. BUT, at the gate, if you brought a can of coke, the price was $29.95. Who knew? I don't know how you find out about this promortion or how long it lasts. Child prices are anyone under 48 inches. Lots of rides available for all ages, HUGE park due to size of coasters. We only managed 6 rides in the day and left exhausted from heat and line-ups. Worth it if you have time and lots of dollars - rides are amazing !!",chauvet
40,Get a Fast pass and take lots of extra money,"Thanks to a fast pass we rode 15 times on the roller coasters (family of teens) during the day we spent there. Costs a lot, but worth it if you are hard core roller coaster fans. The coasters are brilliant. Get there by 10.15 and rush straight for the X2 if you want to do it. Even then you will wait 45 minutes, but that is a lot less than any other time of the day - including the end of the day. Attendants on many of the rides are sloppy and slow -same with food stalls. I guess they don't get paid much and don't earn tips. Wear a fanny pack if you want to take stuff like sunscreen to the park, don't bother taking a bag as you have to store them. Having said that, we put our bag in the $1 lockers and kept it there for the maximum 2 hours each time. That way it only cost us about $5 all day, rather than the $14 they charge to store it near the park entrance which is inconvenient. For us it was a good day because we got a LOT of rides in.",9maaniyya
20,Lots of coasters but it comes with a price - dirty park/lack of training,"Just came home from a visit of Six Flags Magic Mountain. The previous day I visited Disneyland and wish I had bought a 2 day pass for them instead of going to six flags. Yes, Six Flags is less expensive to get in however they get you everywhere else to make it just as expensive as Disneyland. Water cost four dollars and three at disney, however at Disney your allowed to bring water in with you and take your bag on the rides or place near the exit while you enjoy the ride. Six Flags provides lockers which cost one dollar while you wait in line. They don't let you bring your bottled water with you, yet sell it while your in line, not helpful since I left my wallet in the bag in the locker. Ok lets talk about the employees, or should I say poor excuse of employees. They are all interested in just talking and looking to pick up on the ladies. They take forever to exchange the riders and make sure you double check your own seat belts unless you think a 17 year old kid is sufficent. Last item to discuss is their way to get you to pay a truck load for their fast pass, this is a joke and a waste of money sicne only 5 of the rides we had a long wait. If your staying near by go in the morning first thing and then head back at 5 and stay till close. No lines either time and it also saves you from melting out there.",NorCalGuy19
10,FALSE AND MISLEADING ADVERTISING,"We booked a ""package hotel and park attraction"" on the Six Flags web site. The site says, ""3 night stay with park pass"". We found out, as others, that the pass, was not for 3 days. They want you to pay FULL price for days 2 and 3 with the one day pass that you are given. I called and asked to speak with the supervisor, about this web-site, and he never returned my call. FYI, we did find out it you do go to the park, you can go to quest relations, ask for a ""TWICKET"", they will give you consecutive days at the park for $10 each, as compared to the $60 regular gate admission.Thank you,Ed ZigoOur stay at the Holiday Inn Express, was great. Clean, nice and quiet.",zigotechnologiesinc
40,"Great rides, but bring plenty of money","Me and my teenage kids love roller coasters and some of the best in the world are here. In particular, X2 is new and excellent. To get onto X2 we effectively paid 3 times. Initially to get into the park, then seeing that we only had one day to do all the rides we upgraded to a gold pass for $161 for 3, and then on top of the gold pass we had to pay a further $45 for the X2 pass.Drinks and food in the park are very expensive, for what they are, even the water. We only found one free water fountain in the whole of the park, I'm sure this is a strategy to part you from your money!Overall a great day out.",Paul_R_Hol
50,Awesome Day,"I have not been to Magic Mountain in years and decided to take my son (age 10) for his first time on July 21, 2010. Both he and I had an awesome time. We found that the park was very clean and the staff was extremely friendly and fun. We did not have to wait in line too long for any of the attractions. The longest line was at ""Roaring Rapid"" which was approximately 30 minutes but other than that, the wait was 5 minutes or less. As a parent, it was nice to hear from my son that he had a perfect day. I will certainly go back again. He was delighted to ride everything he wanted (some multiple times) before heading home.To be honest about this experience, I must add the couple of negatives that I found.Parking: $15...A little pricey in my opinion.Food and Drinks: WAY OVER PRICED....The cost for a bottled water is $3.25. I can buy an entire case of water for that price!!! My suggestion is to eat before you arrive and on the way home.... or better yet, pack a cooler in the car and leave the park (you can re-enter with a hand stamp). As for the beverages, unfortunately, it is warm there and we have to pay what they ask to stay hydrated!",ChinoMom1967
50,"Loved, loved, LOVED Six Flags!!","I visited the park from July 3 - 7 with my husband and our kids aged 15 and 12. Since we planned on visiting the park (and Hurricane Harbor) on multiple days, it worked out less expensive to buy combo season passes for all of us.A more detailed trip report follows but in short, we found the park to be perfectly clean and the staff to be friendly and helpful. The age demographic of patrons is mainly teens with families a rather distant second. Although I've seen reviews mentioning teens in particular behaving badly, I'm happy to report that I did not see any remotely offensive behaviour from anyone - no swearing, smoking, line-cutting, nothing, zip, nada. Absolutely NOTHING to cause offence at all. I agree with other reviewers that Six Flags can be a bit loud. The rollercoasters are noisy enough (just the nature of the beast) but the addition of the blaring music does make it a tad wearing after an hour or two.Now, a more detailed account: we arrived at the park late in the afternoon on Saturday, July 3rd and sorted out our season passes (got photos taken etc.) After that, we took a stroll around, more to get the lie of the land than anything else. X2 (the first ride we passed) had a 90 minute line-up so we figured rides wouldn't be an option that night but then we walked straight on to Viper with almost no wait at all (max 5 minutes, maybe).The next day (Sunday, July 4th) we got there early (as in 30 minutes prior to opening) and got in six coasters (not X2) with little or no waits in line. By this time, we were all ready for lunch and ""rided"" out so we left the park. Good thing too because it was getting pretty packed by the time we left.Monday, July 5th we did Hurricane Harbour. Not wildly impressed - lines built up very early and with no park maps posted anywhere, it's not that easy to find your way around. (FWIW, I completely understand why they don't have paper maps available but a few more ""you are here"" type maps scattered around the park would be very useful.) Paid just about $20 for three small Ben & Jerry's ice-creams. That was the only food we ate at the park and I found that price scary enough to not even think about eating anything else on site.Tuesday, July 6th and Wednesday, July 7th were riding days. Again we got there early and got all our planned rides in (roughly 6 of them each day) and cut out of the park around lunchtime. Wednesday was our last day, so we ended off doing three wet rides. The river rapids ride (can't remember the name) is very hit and miss - my husband got slightly damp but my daughter and I were absolutely drenched from head to toe, including our shoes. So, if you plan on doing this ride and don't want to squelch and chafe your way through the rest of your day, make sure it's the last ride you do as you're headed out of the pak. Also, either wear shoes designed to get wet (such as flip-flops) or make sure you've got a spare pair if you're going to need your runners the next day.All in all, we had a fabulous time and rode everything we wanted to (i.e. everything except X2 and Superman) at least once and in many cases twice. We'd spent the previous four days at Disneyland (our third visit) and whilst we had a blast there too, the rides were almost lame by comparison - so very glad we did DL first and THEN Six Flags.My top three tips for Six Flags:- get there early;- get there early; and- get there early.Secondary tip - small fanny packs don't have to be stored in lockers. If your bag is small enough that you can hide it under your shirt, do so. It's my understanding (on good authority but I won't divulge the source) that the lockers are, to a certain extent, a cash grab. For larger bags that can't be safely stowed on the ride, it truly is a safety issue but for small pouchy-type bags that can easily be secured on your person, it really isn't necessary.If you're looking for a place to stay that's close by, I'd highly recommend the Hilton Garden Inn - I'll be posting a separate review on that.",HolaGata
40,for thrill-enthusiasts,"Six Flags is my favorite theme park in California. I have a bad habit of comparing it to Disneyland and Universal Studios, but those places are there different agendas. Six Flags is for those that love extreme rollercoasters. The place isn't exactly amazing. Ridiculous prices for food and drinks. And since the last time I've been there, I noticed that for a lot of their rides they require people to get lockers which is a DOLLAR each--meaning that you get a locker for a few minutes and then go to your next ride and do the same. It was a bit frustrating. Also, the lines are super long. Recommend to go on weekdays. Though, I went during a weekend and hardly anyone was there so...you might get lucky.Other than that a cool place to spend your day if you're heading into socal. the tickets are pretty cheap, too. Buy them online, they're usually $30.",shroshro
10,Six Flags sucks - not worth time or money!,"We are a family, 2 adults, 3 kids who have just visited Six Flags Magic Mountain. We had all looked forward to a great day with fun and a lot of roller coster riding - Unfortunately it turned out to be a waist of both time and money.We were visiting the park on a sunday, and even though the park was not crowded at all, there were large ques to almost all roller costers.The average waiting time was up to 2 hours PER coaster! In addition we experienced twice - after being standing in a line for about half an hour - that roller coasters broke down and got closed.In all we tried 3 roller coasters out of a total of 20 - meaning 6 minuttes of fun and 8 hours of boredom and waiting in lines.In addition they play a terrible loud and very annoying music a la Disneyland all over the park - that certainly did not make the experience any better.I would never recommend this place to anybody - not even my worst enemy.",bjhove
10,Not a Six Flags Day,"Just got home from one of the worst times at Six Flags Magic Mountain in Valencia, CA. Beware this amusement park was not the same amusement park it was 20 years ago. It was my daughters 10th birthday (actual day), we arrived just before noon. The park opened at 10am. We headed straight to Viper waited for over an hour in 103 degree heat to get up to the top (waiting) platform, and the ride closed down. Next, we went to X2, and waited three hours to have the ride close. Everyone was suffering from heat exhaustion, dripping sweat, and nearly ready to faint. Everyone was so dissapointed that we decided to leave the park. We thought we would try our luck and ask for a refund and was flat out denied. We reguested a park supervisor to excalate our dissapointment, but one was not available. We felt totally taken advantage of. My daughter, friends, and family will never step foot in that park again. The customer service is deplorable. No apologies were offered.",happiness40
10,Dont waste your time or money...much better things to spend your time on in LA,Five rides were broken and shut down (including superman and batman)...long lines.....rude people cutting in line...,bluelava99
50,Great Roller Coasters,"I happen to visit Magic Mountain near Los Angeles this June 2010 with my family (including two kids, one 10 years and the other 3 years). It is the best roller coaster park I have ever been to. There were long queues for the rides however we took this Platinum Flash Pass which allowed us to cover all the roller coasters in one day and repear most of them. The ride Tatsu is the most amazing roller coaster I have ever done. With this plash pass, you get a booking device from which you can book any ride instantly. Its actually very convenient. We had a great time. There were enough rides from small kids as well. My wife went to these small rides with my 3 year old kid. Dont miss this park for sure!!!",Sumeet161
50,LOVED IT! Family Review: Kids aged 4-14,"I first went to Magic Mountain about 30 (!) years ago, so my wife and I decided to bring our family to the park last week (Friday, July 9, 2010). I read some reviews on this site prior to going, so had a strategy going in which made our visit really enjoyable.Ticket Purchase, etc.We bought our tickets online for 34.99 or thereabouts. We also splurged on the Platinum Fastpass. The Fastpass was great. Although the lines weren't huge anyway, I estimated it saved us several hours of line time over the course of the day. The Platinum level allows you to remain on the ride and ride it 2x in a row. This worked well, but invariably those waiting in line got irked that we stayed in our seats. Most of the time WE had to explain it to them, which was a hassle. I think the ride attendants should explain it, or they should put up a sign or something.So, the Fastpass was really worth it. I wouldn't go to any park without buying this level of ticket.ParkingI read one review where a guy complained about having to walk to the front of the park. Wow. The park is HUGE, so walking another quarter mile or whatever shouldn't really make that much of a difference. They had trams working, but we elected to walk, and even my 4 year-old managed to make it. Man up, people.Cleanliness:I was very impressed with how hard employees worked at keeping the park clean. Honestly, I don't think I saw one wrapper or scrap of paper the whole day. Maybe the park management read some of the older reviews on this site and initiated a new campaign, b/c the park was spotless.Security, etc.We never once felt threatened by the clientele, etc. Again, this is a roller-coaster park and that will draw a very different crowd than Legoland or Disneyland. So we say a ton of teenagers, but who cares?Food, etc.We ate at the Mooseburger lodge (near the entrance to the kids' area), and I think it's the only air-conditioned restaurant there (unless I missed something). Burgers and fries, all really good. We also bought a re-fillable souvenir drink for $12, with 99cent refills. Pricey, yes, but then again it's a long walk back to the car to the cooler. They did have a lot of water fountains, so it's entirely possible to go without pop.ShowsThere are several shows. My wife took my younger kids to the motorcycle/skateboarding show over by Riddler's Revenge, and they LOVED it. We were going to hit a couple more that looked good, but we were having too much fun on the coasters.Park Layout, etc.One reviewer complained about the park being too hilly, poorly laid-out. Holy crap. What are they supposed to do, take a grader to the park and make it completely flat like Disney? Yes, there are hills, but none too steep. There is a tram that runs up to the summit/top of one, and the paths aren't too steep to push a stroller up. The upside of the hills is that they create great launching points for roller coasters, and it's fun to ride them down the hillsides/through the trees, etc.Kids RidesMy kids interest in roller-coasters decreases through the ranks. So, my 14 year-old had a lot to choose from, whereas my 4-year old had 2-3 rides. That much said, there is a large children's area with a LOT of great attractions. There are two small coasters and lots of traditional car rides ,etc. So my 4-year old was never at a loss for things to do and had to be dragged away when we walked around as a family. GOLD RUSHER and NINJA were better-suited to my 9 and 11 year olds, along with COLOSSUS.CoastersSo, I think GOLD RUSHER and REVOLUTION were here in 1977 when I was at the park as a kid. Man how times have changed! They both seemed so tame now, but were still fun to ride. Here's my list of favorite coasters, from least to most:Superman--down for serviceGold Rusher--simple, but good for kids/neophytesRevolution--old, one loop, but good speed and fun to ride down the hillBatman--hanging coaster, pretty intense. Banged my head around a bit.Colossus--old wooden coaster. Bangs you around a bit, but fun.Ninja--Lots of loops, very high, very fun.DejaVu--back and forth. Very steep, lots of fun.Riddler's Revenge--Stand-up, was very smooth and fun to ride.Terminator--Wooden (new), but very fast. One of my favorites.Goliath--HUGE! What can you say?Scream--A-freaking-amazing. Rode in the front row and it was unreal.X2--No words to describe this, but will try. Rode in front row. Had no idea what to expect. When my seat flipped over and I was flying through space with nothing beneath me, well, it was insane. I don't think a more intense ride exists in the world. Not sure if I'd do it again, but holy crap it was fun.OverallLoved it. Will take the family back next year as well. As other reviewers have said (and whose advice I took), planning is key.",SeattleDawg
50,AWESOME!!!!!!!,"My family and I went there not too long ago. We stayed at the Embassy Suites right around the corner, (BTW is one of our favorite hotels I highly recomend it!). The rides there were safe and a whole lot of fun, but if you really want to have fun, and get on the rides quicker than usually, get the flash passes! On most of the the rides, there's a special line for people who have the flash passes, and on that line they're little or no people on line. Here's some rides I highly recomend: Goliath, the 4th tallest steel rollercoaster in the world! 255 ft. above the ground, going 86 mph.(my favorite ride of all time). Terminator Salvation, the part I don't care for, is the videos. but when you get on the ride, you'll be screaming your head off!!! Tatsu, belive me, you'll feel like Super Man when you get on this because your looking down with nothing under you, on your stomach, CRAZY! (if you are afraid of heights I suggest you don't ride these, because I am a dare devil, so these are rides that others might think are insane)The foodThe food there was good, at food etc. or whatever its called, there's a sushi bar, and another place there that sells all american food. For dessert, at the same place (food etc.) They usually have Ben and Jerry's ice cream and Dip n' Dots. All around the park there are lots of food stands that sell frozen lemonade, dip n' dots BBQ stuff, and lots more!",Cupcake212
50,Great Park,"Awsome time, line were fast and the rides were great....can't believe people complain about the price of the food its the same anywhere you go, we packed a picnic lunch and went to our car when we wanted to eat so if you don't want to spend the money on food do the smart thing! The workers were very freindly and the restrooms were clean. Great park all around!",lisas328
50,A review you can trust,"I just visited Six Flags Majic Mountain on May 5 2010 and it was the best experience that I have had at any amusement park in 30 years of my life. I have been to amusement parks all across the country including Cedar Point , Six Flags Great Adventure in New Jersey (home of the tallest fastest coaster in the world) Kings Dominion, Hershey Park, Dorney Park, Busch Gardens Williamsburg VA...... and others, Six Flags Majic Mountain is most certainly worth the visit. We went on a weekday (highly recommended) and had to wait no longer than 10 minutes for ANYTHING including X2. The park staff were above and beyond helpful, the park was clean all but one ride was working (Ninja) and the $32.99 per ticket (online purchase) cannot be beat..... its as good as it gets anywhere I have been. One thing that I constantly read in reviews are complaints about the park which for some reason I cannot understand. For all those previous posters that had not so pleasant experiences the one thing that THEY failed to do was plan. Preparation is key when you visit amusment parks. Yes, parking is $15.00 and to some that may be a bit pricey but if you know in advance it may not come as such a big deal when you get there. In the year 2010 everyone has access to a computer and for $32.99 that is a great price for a place with record breaking world class roller coasters, competitive with any amusement park around. While in the subject of preparation, knowing in advance when you are making your trip to Majic Mountain may provide a better experience. If you plan to go in the summer or the weekends you can expect to wait in long lines in the heat, and it may be frustrating to you. Note: Majic Mountain is open all year long.........go any other time....I suggest after Spring Break and before Memorial day. It was about 85 degrees in May when I went so the weather was great. As far as park expenses like food and drinks go, bring a cooler for your drinks and leave the park to eat. There are several other alternatives to eating in the park, we actually found a nice Mexican place about three minutes away from the park had some Coronas (no alcohol served in the park bummer! we like our beer and roller coasters on the East Coast!) they had some awesome chips and salsa and we were ready to go. You are allowed to leave the park once and re-enter on the same parking pass, other places around the park are Jack In the Box, Mc Donalds, a gas station/ deli and Carl's Jr. is about 7 minutes up the road. Red Lobster was also really close if you are looking for something different. The rides in the park are world class. Goliath was awesome nice speed and crazy g-forces! X2 is as great as it is made out to be, a unique, coaster with great music and effects and an intense 4-D motion that is out of this world, NOTHING is like it. Tatsu is a high flying smooth coaster that is the best flying experience that I have had. Superman was decent nice launch and a good ways up there, Batman was fast! Terminator was awesome, (caught me off guard its a fast one) and the other coasters.........well go and see for yourself.........One last thing.........I mentioned earlier about it being such a good experience the best one for me to date, here is why, good weather, good price, awesome rides, GOOD PREPERATION...... is a must. No lines and no crowd. Cedar Point I love with all my heart, even more than Majic Mountain but I cannot say I rode their best coasters in under 10 minutes.",RideWarriorX
10,Last time for me,"It's my last 3rd, but last time for me at Magic Mountain. We went on an empty May Monday, but it still didn't make it tolorable for me.Here's a few good points first.... Cool rides, coupons available, don't pay full price.Bad points....They will search you upon entry then take even the smallest of food items/ power bars/ gatorade, etc. THEN, they do not open any food concessions for over an hour. Make sure you have eaten right before.Unfriendly staff.. They have hired all of the people that would not have even been considered for Disney, No class or customer service, I would say of some, rude.They have a little scam now that they MAKE you put all items (backpack, etc) in a $1 locker on each ride, you can not leave it next to the ride or with a friend in the line behind you.I heard from some employees that in the summer some people only make it on 3 or 4 rides due to 2-3.5 hour lines.Dirty, run down, $13 cheesburger, $15 parking,OK, I've said my piece. If you are a teenager chasing girls, go to the park for something to do. If you are not in the 13 to 18 age bracket, drop the teen off and pick them up later.",Mr.Elite
40,Great coasters,"We visited Magic Mountain several times over the past few years and have noticed quite a few changes. The first hits you: the parking fee is $15. We bought season tickets and didn't get any free parking passes in our book of values. There is supposed to be some way to register online and get a free parking pass. Since we were visitors and our hotel's printer wasn't working, we couldn't take advantage of this.What we didn't know we should receive is a slight discount on food and drink purchases. That could have left us with a few more bucks in our pockets. We did manage to get a discount on a set of ride pictures near the end of our last day.Another shocker was the new locker system near many of the popular coasters. Each locker, which is now good for 2 hours, costs $1 which must be a dollar coin. We recommend using a $5 bill and getting 5 $1 coins to save a bit of time. You must put a $1 coin in the slot, wait for a locker to open, and take the ticket with your barcode which opens your locker. Grab that ticket immediately. One one ride, we were a bit slower than usual and some teen walking by grabbed our ticket. Fortunately we were able to stop the jerk who looked at us as if WE had done something wrong. It was obvious that he was language challenged and didn't understand what we were trying to tell him. My son just grabbed the ticket and life was again good. The moral of this story is: grab that ticket immediately and hang onto it.The coasters at Magic Mountain are wonderful. Of course X2 and Tatsu are big attractions but Deja Vu and the Terminator Salavation were truly surprising. We havd never seen Deja Vu operating and, given the chance to finally ride it, we sure did. We highly recommend both Deja Vu and the wooden Terminator coaster next door.The ride which generally lacks lines is Scream. We love Scream! We managed repeated rides with only a brief wait--to catch our breath--between them. We highly recommend Scream.For eat, we prefer the air conditioned place near Goliath. They have a sushi bar and you can actually get a salad there. I did have difficulty getting a salad from a young man who didn't seem to speak much English. I ordered a Ceasar salad. He handed me some chips and a sandwich. When I repeated that I wanted a salad, he just looked at me. I walked away and got sushi instead. The next day, I ordered a salad from a young woman who didn't give me dressing. When I returned to get dressing, she wanted to charge me. I explained that dressing comes with a salad and had to bring her my salad to prove that she had just sold me one. Ordering a salad shouldn't be that difficult but when the server doesn't speak English . . .When you go to Six Flags, you might be disappointed that some of the rides are closed. One day was very windy and both X2 and Tatsu were closed. Bummer.Another negative is that, while there is a no jumping the line policy, it isn't enforced. We tired of one person standing in line and letting 10 of his/her best friends get in front of us. A complaint to the line monitor was met with a shrug--he didn't speak English.The park is wonderful and I sure hope some folks who speak English and who can enforce the rules start working there. In fairness to those non-English speakers, all the signs (except for warning/safety signs) were in English. If you can't read the sign telling you not to let others skip the line, maybe you don't know that this isn't permissible behavior. Maybe your mama didn't raise you right.",Cybermama
40,My kids highlight of the US,"Cant believe how much my kids 11 and 14 loved this place. Went to Disneyland which they thought was too baby-ish. Had not planned to go here, but drove past on our way to Yosemite and when they saw all the rollercoasters they just had to go there on our return to LA. They absolutely loved it!!. The lines were long, (April 2009) so if you can buy start of line well worth it.. This is more for the older kids and the daredevils amongst us. I'm a mum and went on everything...had to face my fears..As we are from OZ and have nothing of this sort at home my boys thought it was ""AWESOME""",memeNewcastle
20,Don't go on weekends or holidays,"We went here on a Sunday in April and found it a total waste of money. Although we bought six discounted tickets through AAA at $29 each, it was a total waste due to the lines. We only had 4 hours to spend at park and were only able to ride 2 times due to the lines of 30+ minutes or more. This made it $90 per ride. Anything you buy in the park is totally overpriced and many of the rides you have to pay extra. They are nowhere as good as disney at moving people around. We were in an outer parking lot and had to walk 1/4 mile to tram stop. Once there, we had to wait 20 minutes for a ride to the entrance since they only had 3 trams working. In addition, when entering the park in our car we had to wait 15 minutes to pay. Out of 8 toll booths they only had 2 open (on a busy Sunday no less). Six Flags corporation has teetering on the verge of Bankruptcy for years and now we know why. In fairness, the roller coaster rides did look good.",newtonmatraveler
50,"Fun, Clean, and Highly Recommended!","I went yesterday, Friday, April 16, with my two sons, ages 8 and 10. Having read the reviews, I was concerned about the rif-raf and general park conditions. I needn't have worried. The new CEO, Mark Shapiro, appears to be doing a terrific job, and is to be congratulated on a job well done.First, the park was absolutely pristine -- and I mean pristine! This will sound like an exaggeration, but as my boys can attest, we saw no more than 4 pieces of litter the entire time we were there. Everywhere we went, the park was superbly clean, and the flowers, trees, and vegetation were trimmed and well maintained.Most (perhaps all) the food vendors were open, with many places to eat. Drinking fountains were commonplace, and they worked (including refrigeration!). Outside the kiddy attactions, hand sanitizers were installed.The bathrooms were very acceptable. Those nearer the entrance are quite modern, while those towards the back of the park are older. I'll just say I was surprised at the obvious level of effort being put into keeping things tidy. It is very apparent park cleanliness and maintenance are paramount.Mature trees and man-made (but unobtrusive) sun screens provide lots of shade for queuing riders or those waiting for them. There appear to be many places to rest one's tired feet (I'll couch this by saying a fuller park will mean less places to sit).Park staff are everywhere, most wearing bright yellow shirts, making them highly visible and easy to find. Those I met were quite pleasant. At one point, my boys and I were trying to find the way to ""such and such"" a ride, and one of them asked if she could help (w/o prompting). Another asked if I'd like him to take a picture of the boys and I (again w/o my asking, or even thinking of it).Yes, food is overpriced. Every theme park I have ever been to gouges on this: that's just part of the experience. You can't bring your own food/snacks, but you can bring bottled water (which we did). We didn't really need to, as drinking fountains weren't hard to find.Ninja was the only ride closed, apparently for modernization (it was built in 1971). All the coasters we rode had multiple trains running. The operators seemed to enjoy their jobs, and were pleasant to deal with. On two separate instances, they checked my children for height restrictions, which I appreciated.As far as gangsters, thugs, and kids that think they're a whole lot tougher than they really are, this was almost non-existent. Of course there will always be a few with chips on their shoulders, but I've seen this stupidity in small town carnivals. Security is very visible, and once I saw police officers on foot patrol. The entrance has it's own police station, and park-goers must pass through metal detectors as they enter. The security isn't oppressive, but makes clear foolishness isn't tolerated. Frankly, I felt good knowing these steps were in place. Ubiquitous signs indicate park-goers violating rules will be expelled without refund.Smoking areas are clearly marked, and I witnessed no violations (and no stray butts, either).Overall, I'd rate the park a 10 for cleanliness, 10 for fun, and 7 for food prices. I give ticket prices a 10 (I ordered online for about $30.00 apiece). If you love coasters you should go!",GCBowman
30,For roller coaster fans only!,Nice park but most rides for roller coaster crazies. Only a few rides for wimps and a very small area for toddlers. Fast pass option was worth the money because lines are long at coasters. Lots of places to eat and lots of paramount characters walking around.,letsgonana
50,Magic Mountain Rocks!!!!,"We went the fourth week of March. Never waited in line longer than 10 minutes. I was expecting on huge crowds and long lines. Got buy one get one free tickets then an extra 10% off using Discover card. They even had a special entrance line for Discover card holders. Avoided the cattle call entrance. Food was expensive, parking was $15. Had a great day, definitely got our moneys worth.",SENM-Traveler
50,What you'll need is a strong stomach,"First time Iw as at six flags I was a child. I returned this year and had a blast. Great value too because it wasn't main season. Negative: park only open on weekends. New attractions, water slides and X2 experience. People seeking thrill - you came to the right place. But also for kids a great place to go and worth the money. Expect one or two rides to be closed due to maintenance this time of the year.",hmv89
40,"Great Rides, awful guest relations staff!","This is the best theme park we have been to for fabulous rides but the staff who are on the park s guest relations are abysmal, rude and quite frankly don't appreciate their customers. The staff who run the rides work very hard and in the most part are really good. Just don't expect any intelligent response from these rude individuals at guest relations, they should be sacked for their rudeness! Since reading about six flags financial troubles they really should re-think their customer service quality and they might get more repeat customers, that’s all I can say. Very disappointed with the attitude towards respectable courteous guests.",TheLovells
50,"Go there, but Flash Pass is a must","The ultimate ride in this complex is X2. But dont go there first or it will ruin it for the others. X2 has water, fire, stereo sound and is the wildest ride in this park, possibily one of the best in the world.Took me and a friend TWO HOURS in line, for this ride alone, but was worth every second we waited.But first go to Goliath, Tatsu, Viper, Batman and Riddlers Revenge, some ride you can use the flash pass to cut in line, some dont, check first and study well the map of this park cos its confusing, its hard to find toillet rooms and you walk a lot and go up hill more than you should.",Marcelo F
50,Roller Coaster Heaven,"We visited Six Flags Magic Mountain in October and our kids (aged 11 & 14) absolutely loved it (in fact they enjoyed it more than Disneyland & Universal Studios). The rides here are incredible - you certainly won't be disappointed if you love rollercoasters. We went on a Friday and the lines weren't too bad even though there were a lot of school groups visiting. Popular rides such as X2 and Tatsu had long lines (90+ mins) during the day but once the school groups left in mid-afternoon, the wait for those rides was down to 10 or 15 minutes. Most other rides had short lines all day.I do think they could improve the park greatly by implementing a free system like the Disneyland FastPass on the most popular rides instead of charging exorbitant fees for their FlashPass system (which we didn't use). Food is expensive (as expected) but quality wise was OK.When buying our tickets at the gate we used a coupon from the visitcalifornia.com website to get a $20 discount per person, or if you buy tickets in advance from the Six Flags website you can usually save up to 50% on the ticket price at the gate. Overall this is a great place to visit to ride some awesome rollercoasters.",DarkKnightOz
30,The roller coasters are the definite attraction here...not much else,"My husband and I took a trip to L.A. in August 2009, and we decided to make a stop at Magic Mountain. We had season passes from our home Six Flags park (Great America) as well as a parking pass so we figured we didn't have much to lose. We got there about 30 minutes after the park opened.We had to wait in a line for around 10 minutes to get through the metal detectors. It's sad, but necessary. I also noticed throughout the day there are real cops walking through the park. I'm wondering if safety is a concern during the evening hours. While the overall park was clean, the bathrooms could have used a little bit of help, and there was quite a bit of grafitti, but I'm sure that's hard to control.The main reason we went was for the coasters, and we were not dissapointed. We chose not to get the flash pass (it's way too expensive), and because of this, we weren't able to go on X2 or Terminator, due to the wait time being at least 2 hours for each. For all of the other rides we waited no more than 30 minutes. The coasters were quite fun, and the park has a good mix of rides for everyone.We had an early lunch at Papa John's, and waited around 5 minutes. The food was good but overpriced. Later in the day we stood in line almost 30 minutes for dipping dots. This was absolutely ridiculous. Many of the food stands are understaffed and the food is already so overpriced...it was not a pleasant experience.Aside from that, the staff was quite friendly. While riding a coaster, I set my refillable soda bottle down and someone knocked it off the railing. I spoke with a manager and he replaced it, no questions asked.We would visit again, but we'll eat a big meal before going to the park, and try to do the more popular rides as soon as the park opens.",kelbunny
10,Please... I beg you not to go.,"We managed to go on a fairly hot day (114 °F) and there was not a spot of aircon in the whole place. That coupled with wait times of up to 2 1/2 hours in the baking sun did not make for a happy visit.The worst bit however was how bad the organisation is there. They only run one car on alot of the rides and that is why you have to wait hours, surely it can't be that difficult to send one round while loading another rather than having your staff sitting round doing nothing. Also they made us queue in the sun while loads of the queing system had some shade further down the line that was empty. It's just crazy!The pièce de résistance was that every ride had a boad up saying 15 mins queue time. So some of the rides like Déjà Vu you walked staight on and X2 was 2 1/2 hours it was just pot luck!Now I love rollercoasters but this place just isn't worth going even if they do have some of the best coasters in the world.",Simon V
50,FREAKING AMAZING ROLLER COASTERS,"Went on a Sunday in October - most rides had less than a 10 minute wait. Tatsu is the best roller coaster - huge, fast and oh yeah... your flying. X2, Terminater, and Goliath are also very impressive. This is a roller coaster park, don't expect the charm and ""magic"" of Disney Land, just come for the adrenalin rush! We screamed and laughed the whole time.",teamlove
50,Best Roller Coasters in the USA!,"We visited this park after having visited several other SF parks in the past years. My boys wanted to visit this one in particular because it has more roller coaster than any other SF park. And we were not disappointed. They have every kind of roller coaster you would want. Wood, metal, looping, smooth, rough, you name it! For the most part, the lines were minimal and we really enjoyed riding all the different coasters. The only down side to this park is that is not on flat ground and you will walk your feet off.",abczoo
40,X2 freakin' ROCKS!,"It is no secret that amusement parks are in trouble. They are *way* over-priced, the food often sucks (and even if it doesn't, costs 3X what it does out in the real world), and the lines for rides are too long (yet they happily let richer people cut in front of you). So it is no surprise that they are doing very poorly during the down-turn, and are increasingly desperate for business. Any business. Doesn't mean they will actually have the bright idea to actually reduce their admission prices to reality levels (and discounts and 2-for-1 deals are not actual reductions).But if you go during the off-season, at least the lines become tolerable. So when my cousin came to visit for a couple of weeks, he wanted to go visit Six Flags Magic Mountain. This would be my first visit there.The park itself is nice, with a large amount of roller-coasters. As a bonus, many of them are above average. The food is still radically over-priced though.But the X2.Oh. My. Gods.It is truly a new experience, both literally and figuratively turning everything you thought you knew about roller-coaster riding upside down and on its ear. It is, in all honesty, best experienced with no preconceptions. I would even suggest that you try not to even view a video of it beforehand. Not knowing what will come will make it even more mind-blowing.The only real suggestion I have is this: what you visually think is the last car (when you are waiting in line) is actually the front car. So go to the far left instead of the right.",haydesigner
50,Fun for the whole family,"My family spent the day here and everyone had fun. We have two boys ages 9 and 13. If you like rollercoasters, you will love this place. X2 was the best rollercoaster any of us has ever been on. There was a long wait, but it was worth it! The park was clean, easy to get around, the food was good, and the rides were excellent! Of course the weather was great too!",auswes
50,The best roller coasters on the planet!,"From Tatsu to X2 to Goliath, Six Flags Magic Mountain has the best of all worlds. This is truly a park fit for children of ALL ages. Just 45 minutes from Los Angeles, CA it has the most rides than any other attraction in the LA area... if not the entire state of California. The park is well laid out, clean and has plenty of options for the most picky families.",Salvador R
50,WOW!!!,"If you love white knuckle rides then this is the place for you, about a hour from L.A.Its a fantastic day out and good value for money. Plenty of top knotch and state of the art roller coasters. Enjoy!!!!",jazEngland
40,Great for crazy G-Force rides!,"Ok, so this park has some of the best roller coasters ever. Of course we haven't been out East yet, but hands down this has to be the best park in the West for crazy G-Force rides!!The positives: the rides, hands down!! The reduced entry tickets if you purchase online.The negatives: the $15 parking fee, the wait in crazy uncoordinated lines before the park actually opens, the LONG lines for the restrooms (try installing more than 5 stalls in each of the ladies rooms people), and the quite overpriced food. But I expect that in an amusement park...",ZJM
20,The park is going downhill - excuse the pun,"I live in Southern Cal, and have gone to Magic Mountain many times. The last time I was there was 2 years ago, and I couldn't believe how much it has deteriorated even in that amount of time. I just went last week-end (Sept. 2009) It seems the money they are making is going towards their chapter 11 restructuring instead of into the very thing that attracts customers - the park!First of all - for those complaining about the heat, Magic Mountain has no control over that, and it is a fact of life in Southern Cal that it gets hot. Especially if you go in July or August as a lot of vacationers tend to do. I had to laugh at those compliants. Complaining about teenagers at the park is silly too. What is Magic Mountain supposed to do? Have a 21 and over age restriction?Yes, parking is exorbiant. In addition to charging an arm and a leg just to get in, they had customers parking in a dirt lot way past the paved lot that was almost empty. Being open only on week-ends after the summer is over, you would think they would reserve the paved lot for customers on Saturdays and Sundays. But no - there was some kind of driving exercise going on with cones in the paved lot which sent everyone else to the dirt lot and extended the distance one has to walk to the park considerably.Yes, there are metal detectors to get into the park and they do check your bags. It's part of the safety measure, so I don't mind. It's not as bad as going to the airport for all of you who fly.If you want to ride the most rides without spending extra for a Flash Pass, go to the older rides first. Otherwise you must be prepared for very long lines. The other things I have read on here are generally true to my most recent experience. There is a lot of line cutting with no discipline, they now make you rent a locker for every ride if you have anything that will not fit into your pockets (this is new in the past 2 years), so if you get a souvenir cup etc., they will force you to rent a locker on each ride. The rides break down on a regular basis. I think they have cut down on maintenance unfortunately. I got stuck on the Revolution ride, and the Riddler ride kept breaking down, and Tatsu broke down several times while I was in line, and finally after 1.5 hrs. in line, they said it would be down indefinetly and we could wait if we wanted to, but no ETA to be fixed. It's almost more rare to see Deja Vu actually working than not. The misters were not on for most rides, which is probably a money saving thing. The one ride where the misters were working, they had them on almost at dusk, and it was freezing everyone under them. Also, the water was coming down more like rain rather than mist. It was very uncomfortable. The food is not good at all and is extremely expensive. The eating areas were not maintained, and no one was cleaning off tables or floors. It was really gross. The bathrooms were only semi-maintained. They have taken all of the TV screens out of the lines, so you can't even be somewhat entertained while waiting in the massive lines. This is also a recent thing that I noticed. The regular lockers are very very expensive too. The tiniest, smallest locker was $11 and goes up from there. Most rides do not offer photos anymore. This was something that was really noticeable. It used to be that a majority of the rides offered a photo of you and your friends riding a coaster and you could view it once you got off the ride. This has been cut out except for a very small number of rides now.So, if you go - be prepared to pay more and get less than ever before. I recommend buying Coke cans in the summer months for discounts, or otherwise, buy your tickets online because it's cheaper that way. I didn't try the Flash Pass, so I can't comment on that. I know that it will be a long time before I go back.I hope Magic Mountain really steps up its act, as I did not enjoy my experience at all. The rides are great when they are actually working, and when you can actually get to them in under an hour wait time.",lionchaser
50,THIS IS THE DADDY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"i HAVE VISITED MANY THEME PARKS OVER THE YEARSand I have to say if your a Coaster Fan then this park takes some beating 16 mega coasters which if placed in any other park would probably be their main attraction.I visited on september 3 2009 and it was soooooooo hot 108`The park was empty and I only had to wait to ride one coaster Riddlers Revenge, but I dont consider a 5 min wait very long.In the first hour I rode 6 of the main coasters and was feeling a lttle queezy so I took time out and rode the rest in the afternoon.All the coasters are awesome with the pick beingriddlers revenge,batman and viper but if you asked me on a different day I would probably say 3 different ones.one that freaked me out was de-javu its a very short ride but so intense.one word of warning , if you have people in your party that do not ride coasters, there is little else for them to do.my wife and youngest son dont ride and spent all day at the ride entrance waiting for me or the rest of our family to ride the coasters.Also the food is TERRIBLE bring your own",UkGlobetrotter66
50,Rollercoaster Heaven in California,"Went to Magic Mountain in July of this year and had a hot, but very enjoyable time!As i was here on holiday from Australia, i had pre-bought the gold flash pass over the internet as i was unlikely to be able to afford to come back here anytime soon and wanted to make the most of my day. The pass worked flawlessly!!! My longest wait was 5mins and considering the second they scan you through you can que up another ride...by the time i had finished my ride the next was ready. Although expensive, even more so as i added on X2 and Terminator, I would definetly recommend it to anybody who wants to get the most out of the park during the once in a lifetime visit.As the park opens at 10:30 and you can't get the flash pass till 11, i decided to head to Goliath as everyone seemed to be running the other way towards X2! Got to Goliath and was front row on a half empty first train so i'd head that way first and work around if you dont feel like running to X2!X2 and Tatsu live up to and exceed the hype surrounding them and even Terminator was much better than i expected. I was there from opening till 5pm only, as my shuttle bus picked me up then to head back to LA, however i managed to ride every coaster atleast twice(excepty X2 and Terminator) managing 5 rides on Tatsu.Anyone looking for extreme thrills should head here asap and if unfortunetly like me will likely never be able to come back, grab the gold flash pass and get the most out of your time there!!!",legham
20,So-So Experience,"We went to Magic Mountain yesterday and aside from amazing roller coasters, it is probably the worst amusement park I have been to. First, you have to pay an outrageous fee for a fast pass so you have no choice but to wait in long lines. We got there before the park openned so we could race to X2. After waiting in line 30 minutes, we were told they had to close down and it would be at least 2 hours before it was up and running. We then ran to Terminator at the back of the park and it was closed and would not re-open for 2 hours either. Then we were hot and tired so we went to the Rapids ride. It was closed down. We wasted our first 1.5 hours going from ride to ride and they were broken. By then, all the other rides were 45-1 hour waits. All in all, we stayed at Magic Mountain for 9 hours and were never able to get on Tatsu, X2 or Terminator because they were constantly either broken or only running one car causing the wait to be over 2 hours. Also, the restrooms were filthy. I have seen cleaner bathrooms in campgrounds. The ticket prices are cheap but they must be saving money on cleaning and maintenance. Also, we had a few snacks in our backpack (like we always take to parks) and the security guard at the gate made us thrown them away. It will be a long time before I go back.",PassionfortheParks

40,Excellent rides amazing experience,"We travelled from Australia to go here and as it was an overcast day with scattered showers not all rides were open BUT the ones that were, were fantastic. The crowds were not as we expected due to the weather and we didn't wait for any ride longer than 10 minutes. The food however was terrible, over priced and dry.",Rakaia
40,Great fun for family with teens,"My family went to Magic Mountain on Tuesday in July. We got to the park early and rushed to the far side of the park to ride the coasters there. I don't know if we even needed to have bothered. The park was nearly empty until 11 and rarely did we wait more than 20 minutes for a ride, frequently far less. Tatsu and Deja Vu had longer waits but nobody minded. The park was very clean with MANY sweepers. Lunch was standard park fare. We bought one refillable cup and used it all day between the four of us, so drinks were plentiful and ultimately, reasonably priced. Only one bathroom wasn't very clean, the rest were well kept up. I liked that the park had plenty shade. I don't ride all the time, so I brought a good book and was always able to find a great place to sit and be cool, even though it was over 100 that day. Overall, we had a superb family day!",Bi0gal
20,Six Flags...the good and the bad,"If you are a roller coaster person, Magic Mountain is probably worth going to. For about everything else, skip it.There are plenty of great roller coaster rides in this park. The X2 is everything they say it is and truly one of the most heart pounding rides I've been on. Past this, however, Magic Mountain really is a poor park. There aren't really many other types of rides....I felt sorry for the families there. The park is not very well kept up.....the funniest is that several of the coasters are built over old parking lots and they just left the parking lots underneath with weeds and cracks and all. No attempt to provide a neat park ambience.The overall feel of the park is average at best. It isn't even in the same ballpark as Disney. This would be ok if I felt like they even tried to do well with what they had. They didn't.The staff is not great...a few of them were trying to be friendly and have fun, but many just went through the motions.The food was overpriced, took forever to get, and then was dicey quality at best.Ok, DONT buy a GOLD flash pass, especially if you are going on a week day. The few rides you would need it on, it doesn't work for (X2 and Terminator). I bought one and it saved me time on only a couple of rides. All of the other rides the non-flash holders were getting on as quickly as me. What a big waste of money.ALSO..BEWARE OF THE SMALL PRINT. The Gold Flash Pass says ""this will allow you to reserve a ride on the X2 and Terminator"". Well...that is a bit misleading...the fine print says ""for an additional fee"". So if you spend extra to buy the gold pass, you then have to pay an additional $10 per person per ride to reserve a seat. WHAT!!!!I complained to the manager that this was misleading and he tried to show me the fine print on the website. I don't care if there is fine print, this was still written to mislead. He finally let me reserve a seat with paying the $10.As I walked around the park, I kept thinking.....why doesn't someone from management just walk through the park, take notes on what needs to be fixed, spruced up, or run more efficiently. It's not rocket science to pull a few weeds here and there or paint a few walls.Come on Six Flags....I'm embarrassed for you. You have some great thrill rides to build around....why be so mediocre?",dromega2001
40,Better than expected!,"After reading some of the reviews, I was convinced I was going to get shot by a gang member here. Yes, there are young kids, but nothing you need to be worried about. The rides are great. Try everything, you will regret it if you don't. The lines are not very long, which was nice. ( I guess these parks are hurting with the economy because we didn't encounter lines at other parks either.) Just be prepared to walk...uphill at that. But this was great fun, recommended if you like to get on rides.",ls96sun
40,"If you want coasters, this is the place for you.",We had a great experience here. Other than THe X2 and the Tatsu the lines were reasonable. They also offered a all day refill cup for drinks for $12.99.My favorite ride was the scream.,LavadourWife
50,Better than Expected,"First let me say I'm a Disney fan and visit Disneyland frequently and have been a passholder for 10 years. That being said, I did my best not to compare MM to DL. We visited Magic Mountain on the Fourth of July. I expected that it would be wall to wall people with long lines, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was the opposite.This was my daugther's (11) first visit to Magic Mountain, and my husband and my first visit there in over 15 years.As a Disneyland person - I'm used to huge crowds, long lines, and tons of strollers ramming my feet - especially on a holiday. This was not the case at all. MM appeals to an older more teenager/young adult crowd so we saw very few strollers at all. The lines were relatively short, and the rides were awesome.The workers at the park were ALL friendly and accommodating. On a couple of occassions when I was looking at the map, a park employee stopped and asked I needed assistance or directions to an attraction. Nice!The temperature reached 105 and it was hot! But in lines that were in the sun the workers did their best to keep you in a shaded area before moving you through the sun to another shaded area.The only thing I saw that was sad was the way guests treat the park. Perhaps because the crowd is made up mostly of teens... there seemed to be a lack of respect for the environment. Water bottles, soda cups, trash was left in the ques, on rides, thrown behind bushes, etc. We saw custodial people walking around sweeping up all day long - but with visitors being so disrespectful and lazy to discard their trash properly it was a losing battle for custodial to keep up with.Otherwise - Magic Mountain was a fun and positive experience for my family.",TamV
50,Into big thrills – this is the place for you!,"If you are looking for an amusement park where focus is riding some of the world’s scariest, highest, fastest and longest Roller Coasters, you should definately pick Six Flags Magic Mountain! Favorite ride is Tatsu but there are quite a few breathtaking rides – Goliath, Deja Vú, X2, just to name a few.When the park is crowded, lines can of course be very long. Been there twice and this time we bought the “Flash Pass Gold”. No waiting in never ending lines. You just enter the ride you want to go on in an electronic “box” and you get an estimated time for your next ride, often only had to wait for a few minutes. Absolutely worth the cost if you don’t go very often or if you have travelled from a far distance. No park can beat Six Flags!",sun010

20,Disappointing glad we had Santa Monica beach to go to,"My teenage daughter said she'd rather we spend our time at the beach than at Six Flags.Luckly I purchased season passes so I did save money, price of pass was the price of one day admission. We did enjoy the roller coasters, but as far as entertainment the park just doesn't have any. Even the shopping was disappointing, most items in the stores you can purchase at any Mall. We were wanting to purchase more character items, such as tweety earings and necklaces. The sort of stuff you find at Disneyland, who stock their stores with lots of character items. Also their new summer staff, since most were in training were not customer oriented yet. Example three trams, one sat at the beginning of the park while two others sat at the back end of the parking lot. All appearing to refuse service thus everyone was walking into the park. Store staff too busy shopping for themselves instead of attending to customers waiting at the cash registers. Employees taking their time since they know you want your ""free"" refill on your souviner bottle. I'm sure this review won't stop the customers from coming, but we will not be going there again.",Heartless_9
30,If you aren't thin don't go,"Let me start by saying I am not a huge person, I wear 48"" waste jeans and I wasn't able to ride the majority of the rides.I started off with my fast pass reserved for viper, it never went off so we stopped by viper to see what the line was like, only to find they closed it, didn't notify the fast pass people to let riders know their reservation was never going to come up. Strike 1.Moved on and went to tatsu because the line for x2 was insane. Reservation for tatsu came up and fastpass went off so we jumped in line. Managed to get in line for the front seats and bam, I didn't fit. Now I don't hold the park responsible for making the ride only so big. I understand safety. However, a notice on the website or below the ride before you climb into the seat about the ruff dimensions that will fit on the ride. I was literally half an inch shy of the harness closing on me. Strike 2The staff were very friendly and recommended the Goliath for me saying that my size would be fine on that one. Great, it was on the opposite side of the park but I hiked it for a coaster I could ride. When we arrive at the Goliath the staff are all standing outside and as I approach I advised them the staff at the Tatsu called in a reservation for 2 for me cause I couldn't ride the other coast. They said the ride was closed for ""safety inspection"" and to come back. I asked how long and he didn't know saying that they told him 1 hour more than 1 hour ago. Great. I ask what others I could ride? He said Superman (which was closed) or Scream. So out of 17 coasters there was only 1 currently open that someone with a 48"" waste could ride? Strike 3During my hike to Goliath I used my fast pass and reserved Riddlers revenge. I decided to try that ride before setting out for scream since riddlers revenge was only a little ways away from Goliath. The fast pass never went off, even after 40 minutes of it showing it should be my time. I walked all the way up to the ride and there was no line, walked right in the fast pass and they let me in. The device never went off. Anyway get on the ride and bam, half inch from fitting.You seeing the theme? At this point I have been at the park 2 hours and haven't ridden a single ride. I go to the customer relations office at the front of the park and explain the situation. We had planned a 2 day trip to this part complete with season passes, fastpasses and parking for 2 days. The very nice young lady at the front gate refunded our fastpasses and parking no problem but wasn't sure if they could do anything with the season passes since those had to be handled by corporate. We only bought the passes because the website had a promo for 59.99 (which they said was single day admission) you could play all season with the pass. Afterward we found out single day on the web with promo was 26.99. Anyway, haven't received a refund for the season tickets and we drove home immediately 7 hours. Ruined the trip for me and my wife. If they published information on the size restrictions I would not of been offended and I would of went somewhere else for my vacation.Since non of my friends are ""skinny"" I can't recommend this place.",Phyrelight
40,Why all the bad reviews?,"I have never written a review before but I feel that I should comment about all the negative reviews about how dirty the park is and how its full of gang members.I visted Magic Mountain with my wife and children (6 &9) on May 27, 2009. Though the park is not Disneyland, we found it to be clean and the staff very freindly. We did not feel threatend or unsafe at any time.I would not recommend this park for children under 48"" as a lot of the rides are for older kids and adults.Overall we liked Magic Mountain and will be back when the kids get a little taller.Aloha",AHawaiiantraveler
50,Worth the Wait!,"It's true that the lines are very long at times. but guess what, they are very worth the time. Some reviews in here claim that the park is dirty, and that it has a lot of rowdy teenagers. I have never seen the park dirty! And believe me I go there a lot. As for the rowdy behavior, this park is more for roller-coaster fanatics and that is more along the lines of teenagers. Keep in mind this is not no little kid Disneyland or old-people Universal Studios. This park is for those who like the rush adrenaline from coaster and who know that there is a wait time. If you don't want to wait in line, I recommend going during the week and not the weekend! The reason there is a long line is because this park is famous for its one of a kind roller coasters so there are many tourist. The price is reasonable, I recommend buying the year pass for 60 dollars, it gives you discount in almost anything. I also recommend getting the souvenir bottle, since you get unlimited refills the day of purchase! If you want a theme park with high thrills I recommend this park!",harleyquinn1229
50,Best theme park ever,"The most amazing place ever if you like crazy rollercoasters. If you don't then don't come here cause thats all you will find, and the 1000s of other teenages that love scary rollercoasters. I went on a Saturday, was very very busy, waited in line for over an hour for a ride. Get the front of line pass if your going on a weekend. Food, Drinks etc... are all sorta the standard overpriced hotdogs and takeaway burgers, but its a themepark aimed at teenagers so don't expect too much. Toilets could be cleaner. but its all good enough. I've read other reviews of people complaining about this and that about the park, The place is awesome, get ready for some of the best rides you will ever experience. Don't forget to get the front of line pass for weekends.",danedobre
40,A thrilling experience...,"For the rides, my personal favorites : 3rd :Goliath for the speed, 2nd: X2 for the crazyness and 1st : Tatsu for the incredible flight sensation ...And for my wallet : Ordered tickets thru Internet and there was a $5 fee for printing my tickets at home ... Huh ???, then you can't take anything with you on the rides , you must use lockers : $1 per ride or daylockers at entrance for $11/17/25 depending on size.Pizza's at Papa John where excellent !! And Souvenir Cups with all day free refills was a great value.",PhilippeP
10,Big Craphole,"If your considering taking your family to Six Flags, forget it. This park is not family orientated, it is full of rowdy, disrespectful teenagers. We arrived early in the morning and joined the line for X2, the line was massive and we waited for 90 mins to get on.Signs are clearly visible around the park, Line cutting will result in offenders being ejected from the park. WHAT A JOKE. We had groups of teenagers and ADULTS, just push past us and a lot of other people, on occasion this happened in clear view of park employees, yet nothing was done.Most people dont say anything to the offenders out of fear, when you have a group of foreign teenagers swearing and cursing in the line behind you, and they decide to cut in front of you it wouldnt be a smart move to confront them and they play on this.The park is badly set out, lots of hills and and steep areas to walk around, alot of rides were closed and even if they are open it takes forever to get on them. All in all i spent 7.5 hrs at this terrible park and only got on 5 rides. I would have left after 5 mins but we were on a tour and our bus wasnt returning till late in the afternoon.do yourself a favour and go to another park. Until six flags management do something about the parks clientelle and also clean the place up a bit ( disgusting trash hole) boycott this place.",lovegettinaway90
40,Another fun trip to Magic Mountain,"My 14 year old son and I went to Magic Mountain the last week of March. The weather was absolutely beautiful 80 degrees. The park is clean. And the lines were not that bad but if you want to ride Tatsu or X2 get there early (first thing) and ride them first. They are both phenomenal rides. Everything else the waits aren't usually that long.The staff are very friendly but bring plenty of money. Fries are $5.00, a bottle of water is $4.00. And you can't bring any food or drink into the park. Since it is such a big park there is a ton of walking. Which is good. Watch out for the log ride. After you go thru the whole ride and think that you are done, other patrons can pay a quarter to douse you right at the end. My son and I sat there for almost an hour laughing at others expenses. Although I was surprised how many people got upset. Hello??? You're on a water ride.There was quite a large gang looking element. But they weren't too disrespectful. I didn't feel unsafe. Some of the teenagers were rude and cussed a lot but that seems to be the norm these days.The park has a large selection of rides for the whole family. But truly this is a roller coaster paradise. A ton of fun. Go for the season pass. We got ours from Discovery Kingdom in Vallejo for $50. So you can use the season passes at all the six flags locations.Enjoy!",Stasia74
40,spring break week at 6 flags,"i was worried that it would be crowded and rowdy with teens....never had to wait more than a half hour for a ride. my teens only did the top coasters and since 6 flags is only open for 8 hours a day pre season it was just right. the best coaster if you like to be scared and scream yourself hoarse is X2. the crowd was polite, the employees helpful, the eats and drinks are expensive 10$ for a burger, 6$ for a piece of pizza. the best deal is the refillable souvenier drink 14.99$ if you dont mind sharing the straw among your friends/family( individual drinks are 4$ each) if you fill it 4 times youve beat the system, however you have to carry it around and its hard to do that and ride too. dollar lockers are there for each ride that turns you upside down- but that could get expensive... you dont need their flash pass spring vac unless you have to try to do every ride. ate at el torito across the street- good! the sidewalks have hills so an older person might have trouble walking the park, the weather was perfect-70's can see it might be miserable in the summer unless you go to the water park too(more$)",tealkitten
40,"Great Coasters, Expensive Food/Parking","We had a really nice day at Magic Mountain. It’s definitely a park for older kids who like Roller Coasters and thrill rides. Parking was ridiculous at $15 a day but you don’t have a choice. Oh Well.TIP: We went online and picked 2 for 1 tickets for $1 at Ebay. Regular admission is $60 a ticket so we saved $120. Almost made the 42 bucks (without drinks) for burgers and lunch palatable. Almost….Many folks have mentioned that the park is not clean and that the people who attend are “sketchy.” We didn’t find this at all. Most of the guests were tourists and there were some local teens. Keep in mind, it’s NOT Disney. So you don’t feel as if you’ve been “transported” to Fantasyland when you walk through the doors. Still, the coasters are great and we had good weather. Lines weren’t bad in the morning but in the afternoon, they were quite long—upwards of an hour for the new coasters. We rode most of the rides and walked around. It was sunny and in the 60’s. Too cold for DW but I enjoyed it. We left around 5 and got back to the hotel at 6.",jcontre1
50,Excellent Coasters!,"AMAZING COASTERS!!!! Each ride was memorable. The best by far is Tatsu, a flying coaster, though X (or whatever it is called now) offers a unique experience. The park is very large, but fairly easy to navigate. Great merchandise, as well!",gingingray
20,not worth the time,"We visited on Dec. 26, 2008. The wind blew so hard almost all the rides were closed down. X2 was the reason we even went and it was closed in the high winds. The temps were in the low 50's. There were no shows to attend since it must be the off-season. We thought there would be some sort of Christmas shows since Disney, Knott's, and Universal ALL have Christmas shows until early January. We only lasted 4 hours and decided we were leaving to warm up.",FamilyLovesToTravel2
10,Magic Mountain Pile of Trash,"In one word: disgusting. In many words, there is trash all over the place - both in garbage and people. Don't know where all of these gang-looking kids come from, they walk around with their hoods up even on the hot day I was there and you can't see their face - when you can it is a mean look they give you. There is garbage everywhere. The bathrooms are disgusting, beyond useable - and no toilet seat covers were replaced or paper. Many rides were just old with rust. I kept applying hand sanitizer but of course I have a cold today. Most of the staff that works there are kids and they are on the phone not really paying much attention. When they talk on the microphone when the ride starts, you can't even understand what they are saying. This was the worst experience of my LIFE!",profgrace
20,"Amazing Coasters, dirty and trashy","Wow! The coasters are amazing. They almost make you forget that the park is full of trash, full of trashy people and young hoodlums bordering on gangbangers, and on a hot day like the one we visited on, the long waits for some of the rides were in stifling, unventilated tunnels or in scorching, full sunshine. The food is all extremely overpriced for what you get (even drinking water which you'll need because the drinking fountains taste like 80% chlorine). If all you care about is going on a huge assortment of the absolutly most exciting coasters, then this is a great place. If anything else matters, stay away.",TLCarson
50,awesome time!!,"Such an awesome theme park! Over 10 rollercoasters for sure! One where you fly on your stomach, another standing up, just lots of variety and tons of fun. On the downside, this park makes you pay $1 to store your purse before you get on the ride. Went on a weekday in August and the lines were not bad at all. At most waited a 1/2 hour. Food is expensive but same as any other theme park. Look online for discounts!!",TravelBug8486
50,"Big Park, excellent rollercoasters. Loved it","Perhaps not as flash as Universal Studios or Disney, but the ride quality is far superior. Went on Halloween, their fright fest was very god. 5 different themed frigthening active displays and mazes. The rides are amazing. Long lines for X2, but apart from that easy to get on everything reasonably quickly. X2 is my favourite, truly uniqiue and different. Viper, Superman, DejaVu, Riddlers Revenge, Batman, Goliath, Revolution, Tzatsu, are all excellent. The lesser thrill rides are equally good. Definitely a must for any one interested in rollercoasters.Park as clean and has a good variety of food and beverage options",holstrav
50,"Oh My God, Fantastic!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",Being English I'm always looking for a thrill as the Theme Parks here are terrible in my opinion. This theme park was one of the main reasons I went to California and it didn't disappoint me at all. I started off with all the non important rides and then ended perfectly with X2. Oh my god it's even better at 11pm at night. Definitely go!!!,SoloNightingale
20,Six Flags does care of the children ?,"We spent one day in Six Flags Magic Mountain in mid-july 2008.i visited this park with my two children, 12 years old.it was hot and very sunny. i decided to go to the car park to get the sun-block i forgot in my car.i left the children (twins, 12 years old) alone telling them to stay in front of one attraction. (park was far and very hot)when i came back to the park, i realized that we were not in front of the attraction we talked about.i tried to find them in the park....almost impossiblei told a park member to help me , to call security he calledi waited half an hour, nobody came!even my children told me that a security member told them that he couldn't help them (they told me that they were crying at that time) and they had to find me by themself.!!!!!unbeliveivable.Fornunatly, after 1 hour, i found them out (thank to the yellow hat of my son)it is certainly my mistake, but i think that park members could have been more consideration for children lost in their park.",bendu77
40,A must for roller coaster enthusiasts,"All I can say is... if you LOVE roller coasters, you NEED to go to Magic Mountain. X2 and Tatsu are amazing. Definitely get to the park early and run to X2 when it opens because otherwise you'll wait over an hour (probably two or more) to get on it. There are a few coasters you probably want to avoid - Ninja (because it's just boring), Riddler's Revenge (because it's a stand-up coaster and the bicycle seat causes some discomfort to the groin area), and Revolution (because you'll get a concussion if you don't keep your head back against the headrest). We didn't end up going on Dejavu or Batman, so I can't really rate those. All I remember from a few years ago is that Batman is a really short ride.The only complaint I have about Magic Mountain is that it is expensive. Parking is $15?! At 4 of the rides (X2, Tatsu, Scream, and Riddler's Revenge), you're supposed to put your stuff in lockers that costs $1 and once you open it, that's it... your dollar's gone?! Fortunately, I wore my fanny pack to my side (yes, I know it doesn't look too cool) and was able to avoid the lockers... except for Tatsu. Those guys were serious sticklers. Food prices are ridiculous too, so try not to eat or drink there either :P",Bailar
50,Fun day out!,"I have just been here for the day during my visit to Palm Springs.It took about 2 hours to drive there and was very easy to find.We went on Friday 22/08/08.The first thing i noticed was everybody streaming towards X2 when the park opened....so we followed before the queue built up.Good idea, we waited about 10minutes to get on the ride...which in itself was an amazing experience. By the time we got off, the queue was over 90 minutes long!However, after this we were able to get on every single ride in the park in less than 5 minutes. Basically, we only went for the rollercoasters...and we were able to go on every one we wanted, without any waits and then just leave. Perfect!After X2 we went around the park going on: Scream, Batman, Riddlers Revenge, Deja Vu, Goliath, Tatsu and more. You can look at them all on youtube.In my opinion, the best 3 rides were Tatsu, X2 and Deja Vu in that order. Tatsu has the best section of rollercoaster track i've ever been on. You are facing forwards, then it sends you on an inverted drop then comes back on yourself...putting you through some positive G's. That was an amazing feeling.We ordered our tickets online and got 1 free. So for $60 we pretty much had the park to ourselves for the day...couldn't have asked for anymore than that! I'd recommend to anyone who wants to visit, to do so on a Friday at the end of August if you don't like wiating around for rides!",Blitzwing85
50,Awesome!,This is without doubt the best theme park ive ever been to! Go late August for no queues but be prepared to wait a long time for the X2 ride which isnt really worth it.,Glyn E
50,Good value for money,"If anything we had TOO much fun. We went to Six Flags yesterday (end of august) on a Monday to try to avoid the crowds. Despite the boiling heat the park was moderately busy especially at the start of the day in the car park.Parking was easy as was entry to the park with our discounted online tickets. I highly advise wearing a hat of some sort in the summer time with plenty of sunscreen. It is also worth renting a locker for the day as most rides wont let you take on luggage or loose articles. Make sure to hold your hat or leave next to each coaster you ride as my friend lost his cap on X2 straight away.We queued longest for X2 at the start of the day (about an hour wait) in the sun. The wait was a pain and there isn't any attempt at air-con in the line for X2 yet. Some other rides like Tatsu have cooling mist spray in the queue line and X2 should implement this as soon as possible. As for the ride? X2 is probably the single most scary thing i have ever done in my life. I literally thought i was going to die on a number of occasions and swore i would never ride it again. About half an hour later i was discussing ways to beat the queue with a flash pass and ride the X2 again.We carried on for the rest of the day riding a lot of rides. Of note were Tatsu for its forward facing style, Goliath for its large drops, and Batman for its speed. We didn't have to queue at all for Goliath, Batman, Viper walking straight though to the ride seats. We did have to queue for X2, superman, and Tatsu. Superman is not worth the effort.We found the parks customer service very helpful with the exception of some of the fast food staff. The food and drinks were severely overpriced much like in a movie theatre.All in all it was a great day out with our discounted online tickets. Highly recommended.",Jawatron
10,Will not return,"I hate writing a terrible review on something, but I felt it was important for people to know what they are getting into before venturing out. We are from eastern Canada and went to Six Flags on August 1st during our trip to California. After spending a full day previous at Universal Studios, and having been to Six Flags Darien Lake, I thought I knew what to expect.My first impression was, ""why would anyone put an amusement park in the middle of a desert?"" But it shouldn't be that bad, afterall Universal had many misting stations and alot of shade. This definately was not the case at Six Flags. We had purchased ""front of the line"" passes for Universal, so we decided to do the same for the boys (13 & 18) so that they wouldn't have to wait in long lines. We also purchased tickets for both parks - for a grand total of $468.00 - (YIKES).As we walked up and up and which seemed like even further up we all couldn't get over the heat. Water was priced at $3.50 per bottle. My boys wanted to go on X2 - but that doesn't work with the ""Flash Pass"", so they headed to the first large roller coaster they could find. By this time I felt like I was going to pass out from the heat.The boys said they found it was too hot as well, and they wanted to go on only one more ride. As my husband was having a cigarette, someone approached him and my son and was going to snag our camera. Fortunately, my husband is a large man and was able to divert the would be theif.We definately did not feel safe there - as we did at Universal. There were many gang like individuals everywhere and the atmosphere was not was we were used to from many other parks we have visited in the past. The boys went on one other coaster and then proceeded to tell us - lets get out of here! These two are coaster enthusiasts and couldn't wait for this day. When they tell us - ""were outta here"" something is amiss.We had only been there for about 1 hour, so we proceeded to the ticket counter to see if they would refund even part of our tickets. They were very friendly at the counter but informed us we had to go to guest services (inside the park) because we had purchased ""combo"" tickets and they couldn't help us. Getting back in was the hard part. At this point I'm shakey, feeling ill, and sweating from places I didn't know I could sweat from. With multiple requests, and then finally the head of security - they escorted me back into the park to Guest Services. The young gentleman who escorted me was wonderful, and even went to get me some water.The guest services was ready to refund all of our costs, except I thought my husband had the picture and lunch portion of the ""flash passes"", and they rudely said ""you used the flash pass pieces"" uggh ""NO, I didn't"". He refunded the main portion of the combo passes - and later after I left I found that the two other pieces were in my pocket. Therefore the one hour cost us $160.00 ($79.00 x 2).Definately not an experience I would like to have again. However I would go again to Six Flags Darien Lake in a heartbeat.",DelCor
40,Love Tatsu!,"After reading the reviews of Magic Mountain on this site I was a bit worried about what to expect, but thankfully the park was alot better than my expectations. I visited the park yesterday (5th Aug 08)We arrived at the park at around 11:30, so missed the early morning rush when the park opened. Waiting for the tram at the car park took forever, as they only seemed to have one tram running. However, just as we began to walk towards the entrance the tram arrived so we got on, thankful for the cool breeze!First ride my friends went on was Viper, which they loved. Que was approx. 30 mins so not too bad. After that we trekked (it is on a hill! wear comfy shoes!) towards the Laughing Dragon Pizza Co. to get some Papa Johns pizza...but it was shut! Thankfully there was another place further down but throughout the day we noticed alot of shut drinks kiosks etc.After lunch (which wasn't too expensive, I had a cheeseburger basket for $7 and between me and a friend we split the cost of the $13 dollar souvenir bottle, and got free refills throughout the day, which i highly recommend!) We went on Gold Rusher and Ninja to let our food settle but not to waste any time. The que for Ninja was around 40 mins, and the ride was disappointing, especially the 2nd lift hill which we thought would mean more to the ride, but ended up just being back to the ride station!After all that my friends went on Superman. Que was about an hour, and for a 30 second ride they really didn't think it was worth it. Next we all headed for Tatsu. Tatsu was definetely our favourite coaster of the day (the que for X2 was 2-3 hours long so we skipped it). Tatsu was very similair to Air at Alton Towers near where we come from, but was alot longer and the backwards loop was insane!Next my friends did Riddlers Revenge, Batman and Goliath (I had a pounding headache so gave them a miss). We also went on Atom Smasher in Gotham City which wasn't spectacular but was fun all the same.Overall we had a great day at Six Flags, towards the end queing got a bit tiring and the extreme heat with little shade left us pretty much drained for the day! Previous posters have commented on 'gangsters' in the park, but from what we could see the majority of visitors were families and tour groups. Also the staff were polite and friendly, everytime we refilled our drink they commented 'have a nice day', and the characters around the park were friendly and entertaining.Overall I give Six Flags 4 stars as although the rollercoasters are world class, the loading and off loading of rides was slow and dis-organised and compared to the theming of Disney and Universal, Six Flags was lacking that extra something.",missmaclean
50,Take it from a Local..it's GREAT!!!!!,"Six Flags is unique and FUN in that the main attraction there are the Roller Coasters. Unlike Disneyland, Knotts or Universal Studios, this park is strictly for Thrill seekers who have'nt any time for the slow paced rides such as the parks aforementioned.It is a ""public"" amusement park, so anyone young or old, gay or nay is welcome. Now behaviorial problems that My generation may exhibit due to immaturity is found in any public place, so of course it is up to parents who come with their families to monitor their own. That's just common sense. The acts of others should never hinder a potentially Great Time for anyone looking for it. I have been to Six Flags on numerous occasions, may it be field trips with school during the week or family trips taken on the weekends. And I have not once come away from my experience there with any less enthusiasm for any plans I may have to come again in the Future.So don't take My word for it, see for yourself. I'm sure you'd have a Fantastic time. I personally always have a BLAST!!!!!",RenaLuina
50,What a bargain....$29,"We went in mid July. Had read some of the more negative reviews but didn't witness any ourselves. Purchased the tickets online at $29 each, what a bargain. As they were so cheap went for the fast path tickets at $20 as well.Arrived at the park, picked up the fast path tickets from behind customer services and went straight to X2, it wasn't working but they took 30 mins to tell us. Here we go I thought, a wasted day.After that we literally walked from ride to ride, didn't need to use the fast path tickets as the queues were so short. I ended up giving them away to someone coming into the park as we were leaving at 7pmDid all the other rides and then went back to X2, spent about 90mins in the queue but after the ride it seemed like minutes.Yes drinks and food were a bit on the expensive side but at least no one tried to con 20% out of you as a tip.If you have teenagers, forget Knottsbury and do six flags, you won't regret it.",Paul T
50,Great Park!,"Very Nice! Clean, lots of roller coasters to ride. Not as many people as you would think. Lots of hotels in the area to choose from. Well worth the money. There is also a water park attached. Lots of rides for small children, too. Overall an excellent park.",gokc1
40,Six Flags Veteran,"I, as others, have read the reviews both positive and negative. Due to the negative posts, I almost cancelled a trip to Magic Mountain. Some background info, I have been going to Magic Mountain since it opened in the 70's. We lived an hour away and were always heading down there with youth groups, as a family and in my 20 and 30's with my friends. I am 40 now and decided to take my neice and nephew and a foreign exchange student from the Ukraine for a visit. I almost opted to go to Knott's Berry Farm but Magic Mt. was closer.I was not disappointed. We went on Friday so the crowds were relatively low, there were a lot of kids from various kids day camps in the area (they all wore shirts with the names of the camps they were attending). I didn't witness any rude behaviour from teenagers or otherwise. All of the park attendents smiled and greeted us, some joked with us, some thanked us for being there. We easily got on every ride with no waiting or a very short wait time. The longest wait was on the Yosemite Sam falls which was our favorite ride of the day even though we got soaked with water it actually felt good as it was very hot! and the X2 which I didn't not ride but my nephew and foreign exchange student did.Now, in all honesty, the park isn't super clean like Disneyland, some of the rides need serious paint jobs and deep cleaning, the Jet Stream boats looked horrible - it doesn't appear that they have been painted/cleaned since they opened the ride. The food prices were high, but it was great to have ""brand name"" restaurants to chose from - Papa John's pizza, Panda Express, Cold Stone, Johnny Rockets. We brought our own water bottles and filled them up at the water fountains. I found some cute souveniers for less than $2 for my 4 y/o daughter, a winnie the pooh change purse and a tweety bird juice glass that is very . I also used the penny press machines in the park for another cheap souveneir - only .50 cents plus your penny. Our family is now collecting pressed pennies from various places.All in all, for the reasonable price of $26 per person (purchased tickets at the credit union) and the high price for parking $15 -- it was a fun experience.",Gregswife2003
10,Still Stinks,"Nothing has changed at this park. Judging by the reviews here it seemed as things have changed. Nope. Ride operations suck STILL. Most rides were breaking all day and this is not a family place. Lots of rude teens and hoodlums. Employees are rude and mean and do not care to be at their jobs. Food service sucked and this place is VERY overpriced. Food and tickets are so expensive it's not even funny.The park really isn't that clean either. The midways are OK, but in the ques there is trash everywhere. There is trash on the ground, in bushes, trees, flowers, everywhere in any que. There was even a gumwall which was disgusting.The rides are OK for thrill seekers if they are working, but DO NOT bring your family here. I will not be returning and the place is exactly the same as it has been for years.Six Flags stock isn't looking good either, it is below one dollar! I sense an end in the Six Flags chain. Everything just gets worse and worse each year. I will not be back.",DT0wn
50,six flags roller coaster heaven!,"Went there in June 08, very hot and the lines were long for all the good rides. Plenty to do and see though. Buy the refillable drink as you get free drinks the day you bought them and only 99 cents the other days. The park is open until 10 and the evenings were nice and alot cooler, the crowds seemed to die down too.",nozzleman6
50,Six Flags June 08,"Having spent many hours and dollars at amusement parks all over the southern us, Magic Mountain is top notch!!Beware of the road construction, as you drive in. It looks confusing - If you are unable to see the poorly placed signs, my suggestion is simply follow the cars in front of you...they are probably going the same place. Once you get through the parking booth, if you have small children with strollers, you may want to drop them off at the ticket booth with someone in your party, if possible. They can stand in line to get your tickets while you park. It is quite a walk, and they do have a shuttle, but it was always full, and not quite as efficient as Disneyland. We walked.Once you get in the park, check your map. It's kindof a BIG CIRCLE with a few nooks and crannies within. Magic Mountain is VERY HILLY and a difficult walk for those that may not walk well. If someone is in a wheelchair, the person pushing better be in great shape! However...hills or not, there is a LOT of shade and a LOT of benches to rest!!X2 had about a 2+ hour wait. Didn't look like all it was cracked up to be...So, as long as there is one or two rides with exceptionally long lines, most of the others are shorter. We walked right on to VIPER and then rode it again. Lots of upside-down! Great Pictures there!! Great ride to start with!Ninja had a small wait, and this is a good one for small kids that arent big enough for the MAX rides...I wasn't impressed, but for little wait, my 7yr old loved it! The log water ride directly behind Ninja is great on a hot day...you do get a bit wet!I really enjoyed the Riddler - standing coaster!! When you load, there is a ""saddle"" of sorts that goes between your legs. You are supposed to pull it up until it is snug...be CAREFUL not to pull it too far!! (ouch!) When they lock down the over-the-shoulder bar, the saddle also locks. It's quite a wild ride - the corkscrew is something else!! (MAKE SURE YOUR LOOSE CHANGE IS SECURE IN YOUR POCKETS!!)The Batman ride is a swinging/sitting ride. It's pretty good too!DH did the Superman...line wasnt too bad - maybe 15 minutes - and the ride lasts all of what 5 seconds. But the 0-100 was intense!! When you are in Gotham City, and you walk under the track, it is deafening!!Goliath...well, what can I say. AMAZING! BUT...riders beware. That ride pulls some serious G's through an inward spin towards the end of the ride - I could feel myself beginning to black out...But I was ok. My 13yr dtr didnt like the fact that she couldnt see through that part; I suspect the same thing happened to her. But my 7yr old (who was barely big enough) had to ride it TWICE!We had some teenagers hand us a couple of FAST-PASSES as they were headed out, (see, there are some amazing nice people out there!!) so my 13yr and I headed to Tatsu. I almost felt bad bypassing all those people standing in line for over an hour...We got right up there. Now, Im still not sure if I liked this. Tatsu loads you right side up, sitting. Before the ride takes off, it sucks up the seat part and leaves you face/stomach down. Lots of pressure on your chest. It does a couple corkscrews, which are fast, and like - WOW...But it does a great big LOOP that was just too wierd for me. It was an experience, but I'm not sure I liked it.Oh - one last word of advise...Do not go on Revolution if you are nauseous...It's a very rough ride and past it's prime.Overall, we rode about 15 rides in about 6 hours time - short lines, not too hot. Great time! I still have a map if you have any questions...Oh - the cotton candy was gross...was flavored kinda berry-ish?? The Cotton Candy at Disneyland was to DIE FOR.But, Six Flags was nicer, cleaner, faster ride loading, less breakdowns, more fun than Denver or Dallas. I dont remember Atlanta, but for where I've been...SIX FLAGS MAGIC MOUNTAIN is KING!!",marci4tony
40,Best Six Flags there is.,"I've been to a few Six Flags, and this is by far the best when it comes down to rides. It isn't the best atmosphere, but the thrills are there. Tatsu, X2 (perhaps the best ride there is), Scream and Deja Vu are all awesome rides. Both times I've went though, one of the rides has been down...so that's a bummer.The downsides, and the reason for the docking of a point, is two-fold: 15 dollar parking and the crowd. Yes, the crowd tends to be a little ""gangsta"". There's no getting around that. Generally, I would say most people wouldn't have a problem, but somebody spit on a rollercoaster while we were on it and it landed on my wife. Disgusting. Kids are generally pretty rude here as well. If anybody's polite to you, consider it a blessing.As always, if you have further questions about this place feel free to message me!",NODAK1979
30,A bit more effort needed,"This is a tricky park to rate. We love roller coasters and have been to many parks, but this one was a must as it’s supposed to have the biggest and best rides in California. If it was done well, it could be 5 stars but it’s not, which is a shame.Yes, the rides are brilliant and in another setting would be memorable and outstanding but the park just has something lacking that loses it the edge it should have. It’s a combination of things, starting with not opening at the published time of 10am and instead holding people hostage to see a boring and annoying pre-school bit of ‘entertainment’ for half an hour outside the gates. No one was interested in this and just wanted to get inside so what was the point?There is virtually no theming and very little effort has been made to make the area look attractive. The layout of the park is confusing and doesn’t flow. It must get very hot in the summer as there are no fans in the lines – and no distractions to take your mind off the queues either. Luckily we didn’t have to wait long for anything.We got a good deal on the tickets - $27 each although for online ordering we were charged an extra $3 for delivery even though we printed out the tickets ourselves! Parking costs are not included and are expensive - $15. Still, even adding that up, it was a cheap day out for people from the UK. Maybe that’s part of the problem – it’s cheap, looks cheap and attracts a cheap clientele.We rode every coaster except one and every water ride except one and had a great time but on the whole would prefer something with a bit more depth.",Que
30,Fun Place for Teens,"Ok, I don't like rides like these so I am going to give the experience my kids and husband had here. The parking is good, there is a free tram that takes you to the entrance. I printed the tickets online, that made it easy. There were 5 of us so I found a Promo Code online to get us in for $29 each. That was great since they are $59 each normally. There are huge rides! Fast, crazy rides. I rode 2 and I was done for the day. I just followed my crazed kids and husband around all day while they rode. It is nice during the day and cold at night so prepare for that. There are lockers where you can put your stuff. The food is OUTRAGEOUSLY Priced. The souveneir cup is 12.99 and $1.00 per refill. The food is ridiculous and I can say that because we spent 2 days at universal studios before this trip and the food and drinks there we soooo much cheaper. The kids loved it though, they rode like crazy kids till 10pm. I am glad I got cheap tickets and I am glad they had a wonderful time. I got to see my favorite superheroes, batman, aquaman, wonderwoman and robin, that was my favorite park. Also, another tip, they have carnival type games there that are decently priced. You actually win too, so that is fun. Take comfortable shoes for sure, lots of walking at this attraction.",marina282828
20,"Love the Rides...the ""Gangsta's"" made for less desirable atmosphere","We spent last Thursday at Magic Mountain for the first time. The rides were terriffic and we had a ball! We spent a little extra to get the ""fast passes"", so that we didn't have to wait in the long lines (I would strongly recommend! If anything, you don't have to get stuck in line for 30 minutes+ with a bunch of rude, cussing, and obnoxious ganstas!) I really had a tough time between rating this nuetral or just OK...if I just took into consideration the great time our family had on the rides, I would have rated it Excellent. However, The ""Gansta"" crowd really rubbed me the wrong way, considering that I was expecting a more family oriented crowd. The cussing, inappropriate conversations in public with total disregard for kids standing next to them, the teens hanging all over each other...playing touchy feely while waiting in line (on two occasions during the night we came accross couples making out in the dark recesses of two of the rides exits) made it rather uncomfortable even with my 14 year old daughter and friend.The lighting at night is not enough, especially taking into consideration the class of the majority. Although, I must say that they had a lot of Security around, which did provide some level of comfort. The paths to get to the different areas was just plain dark.There wasn't enough employees in the eating areas. I got 4 Dippin Dots and was told I had to get out of the line I was in and go to the register on the other side of the room to pay. I watched the guy that was behind me get his order and walk right out of the door with his Dots. We had great service at the Moose buffet, but I wouldn't get the buffet, as it looked terrible! We ordered Burgers and Chicken sandwich which were very good. However, the waitress just had a walk-out...mmaybe it was just the crowd and not that they were short employees?!?!They really seem to be trying to make it a family place with the rides for the kids and the characters walking around...it just seems to me like it just isn't cutting it in that respect. It almost feels like it was a ""hang out"" for the hoods...I don't know if it was spring break for the local high school, or if the recent graduates just haven't grown up yet, but I would not suggest taking younger kids at all.Most of the employees just didn't seem to be happy to be there, or happy you were there. For instance, you could tell management had tried to add an element of ""fun"" to the script of the Ninja operator by including a karate ""Hi Ya!"" However, when the operator said it monotonously, you couldn't figure out what she was saying!?! (Directly the opposite of the treatment we received at Universal Studios, where a majority of the employees said ""Hi"" just walking by, and when you got off the rides they clapped, cheered, and thanked us for coming!)Anyway, for the coasters and the great fun they provide, this is a great place to spend a day...just get the fast pass!!!",Jtibbs1
50,Crazy Crazy Stuff!!!!,"If it wasnt for my teenage son travelling with me I would have never visited this place. We decided to skip Disneyland (shock Horror) and spent the day here.Magic Mountain delivered to us our best ""Mother and Son"" day out.This amusement park compared to those is Australia ""Rocks"" and delivered me some serious heart stopping moments.You will end up on rides that will have you dropping backwards, upside down while being flipped and photographed... Charming!!!It was a stinking hot day in California the day we spent here and the water rides were refreshing and lots of fun.The longest we waited for a ride was an hour but there were many that were further away that we got straight onto. Food options were good but water is EXPENSIVE, so pack your own.The wait for the gates to open was long and hot and there was no shade so take a big hat and loads of sun screen.I was so sick of screaming and jamming my eyes shut that by the end of the day my heart couldnt handle one more ride. We didnt have time to get to all of the rides but it wasnt because of time it was because we kept going on some of our favourites.We only had one day but if you are in the area for a few days, the mulit day options were great bargins.As with everything els in LA you needed a car to get too it. It took us about an hour from Hollywood to get here.Fun for teenagers and cool parents :-)",Thebirchadventure
40,A UK Perspective? - A great park!,"We came where with a lot of trepidation having read some of the reviews & had a fantastic day. If you're visiting from the UK, think Alton Towers or Thorpe Park (but with MUCH better rides) rather than Disney or Universal & you'll get what I mean.We went on the Friday before Labour day & the park was really quiet- enough people to get atmosphere but almost no queues- the longest we waited for a ride was 15 mins.The park is huge & sprawlling so be prepared to walk. We found it clean & well maintained & the rides theselves were outstanding. Food was expensive, but then show me a theme park where it's not!I can see how it could be not as good if it was busy, In particular there seemed to be no fans or cooling or even shade in the queueing areas, which was no problem for us as there were no queues, but the temp while were there was 117c so if there were it would have been a problem.It is Warner Bros themed, so lo there were a number of characters parading aroung if you like that sort of thing - Daffy Buck, Batman, Wonder woman etc. But the main reason to go is the rollercosters which beat anything in Disney by some way.So overall, if you go expecting UK theme park standards, but with better quality rides & pick your day so its not too crowded it can be a fantastic day out & brilliant vaue for money .",gac100
30,"Some great rides, but poor staffing","We set aside a day on our West Coast trip to try some of the 'extreme' rides that I'd heard about here. I will start by saying that riding X and Tatsu easily made the side trip worth it. Unfortunately, this park could be so much better. We headed to X as soon as the gates opened (Sunday, August 12) and we're greeted with a sign that the line would be slow due to scheduled maintenance. That was an understatement. Only one train was running and although we only had about 100 people in fornt of us, it took over 30 minutes to ride - not too bad, but it was frustrating watching only 1 train leave every 6-7 minutes. We then headed to Tatsu - closed with technical difficulties. We continued back to Deja Vu and we're next to ride after 30 minutes when it broke down with a train stuck vertically. We went to lunch and spent over $50 to feed our family of 5. The fried chicken was horribly dry and the turkey leg was pretty tough. Get the refillable souvenir cup - it's worth it on the hot days. We finally got some riding in, and we pretty much walked on to Goliath (2x), Scream, Colossus, and Batman. We started to wait for Riddler's Revenge and Deja Vu again upon reopening, but the lines we're so slow that we decided not to. We rode Superman, but again they just had one side working. No attendants we're at any ride entrance and people we're 'line jumping' ahead of us all day. One kid was even amusing himself by effectively closing 'Viper' by connecting the chain across the ride entrance gate. My 42 1/2"" daughter was never checked for height on any rides. We finally got back to Tatsu and waited in a very slow moving line for 1:05 to ride it before heading out. Again, just 2 trains running on one of the loading tracks. Several minor attractions, including the Scrambler and some kiddie rides, we're just closed with no explanation, and there was plenty of advertising looking for workers. $15 parking quite a distance from the main gate was ridiculous as well. I'm glad that I got to experience Tatsu and X, but I guess that we're just spoiled living so close to a much more efficient and better run park - Cedar Point.",bcreilly
40,Amazing roller coasters,"Incredible roller coasters. This park is worth for its wild rides. I went today with my teen son, we had an excellent day, we had to leave close to 7:30 pm. due to sore feet after 9 hours of queues and the best rides we've been in.As a family, we came for 5 days in Disneyland Resort, we are huge Disney fans. My son and I decided to go to Magic Mountain for a day, my wife and daughter preferred to stay in Anaheim.The best rides: TATSU and X, both are thrilling experiences, the other rides were neat, specially Goliath. The hour and a half ride from Anaheim was worth. If you are traveliing with teens, think twice about this park, other Six Flags parks have two or three ""thrill rides"", this has 8. I overheard two families having porblems because the father went to a ride and ""appeared"" after 2 hours queue, while the mother waited outside the ride with the kids.The park is dirty, understaffed, some rides are incredibly slow to load, such as TATSU, X and Batman, this is makes long lines even longer. Anyway, in general, its worth.",Jaragono
50,Fantastic park - Vastly improved,"Six Flags Magic Mountain was one of the reasons we wanted to visit SoCal again. We've done other attractions and areas around Los Angeles, and we had to go back and do this.What a fantastic park. We visited on the Wednesday and Thrusday after Memorial Day weekend, so we were expecting a few crowds and queues for rides, but there were little to none at all. They have some of the best roller coasters in the world, and a lot of them are my personal favourites.-Rides-The best rides in the park are Tatsu (best ride in the park), X, Riddler's Revenge, Déjà Vu, Batman: The Ride and Scream! Goliath is also worth a few rides as well, but in my opinion does not match up to the others I listed, although it did have a great first drop. The park also has 4 water rides to enjoy as well including a river rapids ride. Gold Rusher and Ninja are suitable for probably a more diverse age range.-General park operations-The park in general was clean, had a reasonable atmosphere and ride operations were good with more than one train running for all the big rides except Scream!. There were also a lot of entertainers around the park including Looney Tunes and DC Comic characters like Batman and The Flash.-Food and parking-The food is expensive, but the Papa John's pizza was very nice, as was ice cream from Cold Stone Limited. Parking is still $15, but that's probably the only major low-point of the park.-Things to do for younger children-There is a children's section at the front of the park with quite a lot of kiddie attractions, and there are other kid's/family attractions spread around the park but I wouldn't recommend taking just little kids to the park. There are also numerous shows that take place in summer like the Batman Begins Stunt Show which I myself didn't watch, but does look fun to watch.Overall, this is the best park I've visited. The atmosphere may not be amazing, nor is the park very family friendly, but the rides were just amazing as were the short length of time I queued for them.I highly recommend going to the park on days in the week after memorial day weekend. That's when I went, and the operations were excellent as ALL the rides were open. Basically avoid visiting the park on weekends as it could become very crowded.",JS9148
40,Favorite Roller Coaster Park,"I last went there in 2007 but have been several times in my life. I love the thrilling rides and roller coasters. The coasters are worth it, but you have to know how to scope out the lines. I personally don't think 3-4 hours of line waiting is worth a ride, but they post signs to warn people of the wait time so you can pass on by to another ride and come back if you need to. The place has all the thrills for the thrill seekers, kid rides, water rides, daring drops, high speeds, twists, and upside down loops. The food is the typical expensive theme park food, so plan to bring extra money for that. Otherwise you have to go back out of the park to eat because you can't bring your own food into the park. We used to bring coolers and eat at the green park areas in the parking lot outside the park during lunch to save the extra bucks. Parking is expensive, so carpool. They always have deals and sales, so research online before buying tickets. All in all, it is worth every penny of it.",ghannahj
40,wild rides,Great theme park for the roller coaster set and for toddlers.Went on a Monday in mid-July. Park was not crowded except for a couple of newest coasters. We walked right on Goliath and several other coasters most of the day.Prices for food are theme-park high. Those on a budget will want to get a stamp and go outside the gates to nearby fast food places for lunch or dinner.,ramped
20,Understaffed,"I pre bought our tickets on line and saved a massive amount on the gate price, although a lot of the hotel coupon books also carry money off vouchers too and also wont charge you $3 for the privilege of printing your ticket at home! I was under the impression that the park opened at 10, so we arrived about 9.40 and queued for the car park ($15) for about 10 minutes. We parked and walked to the gates. The pre-paid tickets state that you can go straight to the turnstiles and indeed you can, but they didn’t open unto 10.30 after enduring a rather pointless ‘opening parade.’ So we were kept in a ‘holding pen’ getting increasing hot and crowded until the gates opened and the park was declared open for the day. Unfortunately, you then have to go through the turnstile and have your ticket scanned so it was all a bit pointless.The park itself I felt looked a bit neglected and scrubby, I also felt it was massively understaffed. None of the little drinks kiosks were open and when the food places finally opened at 12 there were big queues at the windows. Food isn’t cheap so we didn’t eat but expect to pay $3.50 for a coke. The rides also suffered from understaffing and poor queue handling, we watched an empty car arrive and pass through the loading bay about 10 times on Riddlers' Revenge as the queue to ride got longer and longer. All that said, the rides are fantastic and ‘X’ took my breath away. The park stays open until about 10 and if we were to go again we would probably aim to arrive about 3pm in the hope of missing some of the crowds and not being quite so hot.",violet3violet
10,Don't waste your money!,"I went to Magic Mountain back in the 70's, and it was so completely awesome!! I was really looking forward to going there with my daughter on our recent vacation to Southern California. We were so disappointed. First of all, we were staying in Anaheim, so the drive of 2 1/2 hours was a lot in the first place, but still we were excited about going. We get there, and the park was just dirty, and the staff was not very friendly. Maybe it was more noticable after going to Disney, where people actually seemed ""glad"" you were there spending hundreds of dollars!! Anyway, the rides were very extreme, and so in their defense, if that's all you are looking for, its probably ok, but there were too many teenagers making out everywhere and staff that just wanted to visit among themselves.... just not a great experience. I have a season pass, but won't be going back...EVER. I wish we would have gone to Disneyland/CA adventure one more day, instead.",Just_me_in_Oregon
50,"If you love rollercoasters, you'll love this place!","I had so much fun at this amusement park. Ok, where do I begin? We arrived in an area right outside the entrance at around 1030. We decided to grab something to eat at the Wendy's that was there because we knew the food in the park was going to be really expensive. We got to the front gate around 1100. BRING CASH! We didn't know that the parking booth was cash only. Regular parking is $15. The only way we could use the Visa was if we paid for the valet parking-$30! Ridiculous! But that was probably one of the only con's about the park. I had already printed the tickets online, so there was no need to stand in the ticket booth line. We just headed straight for the gate. Don't bother reading the map that they give you if you're not looking to ride anything in particular...just walk and ride. The lines were shorter than I expected. The longest we waited to get on a ride was 1 hour. I guess that's because we went on a Monday. The coasters were awesome! That's all I can say about them. You definitely have to ride ""X"". Wear comfortable shoes! Be prepared for alot of walking. Didn't buy any of the food cause it was really expensive. But we did buy a drink. For $10, my boyfriend and I shared this big drink in a souvenir bottle and got refills for $1 all day. ($1.08 with tax) Found out that we can even bring it back with us the next time for $1 refills. Pretty good deal. We didn't leave until about 2130. And I guess that valet parking came in handy because our feet were killing us by the time we left the park. lol. This was a great trip to a wonderful amusement park. It's my favorite in So Cal so far. If you have questions, please contact me :-)",msjaycee
40,Good Place for Rides,"On visiting S. California with two teenage boys, a visit to a ride park was a must.Ignore anything negative about gangs, etc. you may have heard. This is a very family friendly park. Perhaps the walk through the metal detectors as you enter was a response to problems that no longer exist. There are lots of big coasters and a good kids area too.Yes the parking ($15) is high and food prices high also. We ate before entering and after leaving the park and only snacked while there to save a few bucks.Expect to walk a lot so wear comfortable shoes. The lay-out takes some getting used to and the map they hand out is too large to fit in a pocket.Lines on the Sunday we were there were short except for the two or three most popular rides which had waits of an hour or so. For extra cash you can get a flash pass to allow you to avoid the wait and go to the head of the line.TIP: Half price tickets are available by buying your tickets online.Overall my teens had a great day at the park and I'd recommend it to others.",Dewitt_traveler
50,Excellent Park,"I am not a patient person and when the park opened 30 minutes behind schedule my mood was not good however that is the only negative part of my experience.We went mid week and did every ride in the park in under four hours. It has some of the best rides we have experienced and is our fav pure coaster park.The parking charge of 15 dollars is a pure rip off as you have no options in travelling to it, however since we picked up a 2for1 deal on the tickets it wasn't so bad.Food and drink is expensive (4 dollars for a soda) but this is not unique to this park.",Paramedic143
30,Great day - incredible roller coasters,"My last visit to Magic Mountain was in the early 90s. They have added some incredible roller coasters. We purchased the Flash Pass in advance but the crowds were light on the day we were there (May 15th). I found the park clean and enjoyed our visit.Highs: Low crowds, great roller coasters, clean and well-kept.Lows: Map is practically worthless as we kept trying to find the entrances to the rides we wanted. Ninja was broken by the time we got to that side of the park. Ridiculous prices for food and drink (but I guess that's normal for theme parks). $15.00 to park? What, are you kidding me??",dnevillepdx
20,Somebody Give them a Paint Brush,"My initial impression was the $15.00 for parking. Then there was only one tram running from the parking lot. This was on a Saturday. It appeared this park has no money for upkeep. There were many areas with peeling or no paint. Floor tiles were missing in many areas. I hope they use what little money they seem to have on ride maintenance.On the good side, they have the best coasters. The rest of the rides are lots of fun.Food is very expensive as it usually is in So Cal amusement parks. They seem to appeal to and promote to the Hispanic community. Security was tight. They don't appear to put up with nonsense from the guests.That is good. The last time I was there was 10 years ago. I plan to return in another 10 years.",petest50
50,My SFMM Review,"SFMM is a very good place to go if you want rock hard fun!! Everyone I know goes there [ or works there lol ] but yeah. Its crowded at times. To fix that, dont go Friday afternoon or Saturday. Go during the week or on Sunday. Either way, it a really fun park for young adults! yeah theres litter... but we [ as in the people who littler ] make it that way. OVERALL... SFMM IS KEWL AS ICE!!! CHEA BOii!!! :))",WiiZKiiD
50,Amazing VIP Day Out,"Ok so after reading some reviews on certain websites I was a little worried about what I would find at six flags but was never put off. My day at six flags was no ordinary day as when we arrived we were greeted by a tour guide asking us if we were from the UK, it turned out that my dad had purchased tickets for the whole family to have a VIP day at the park, at $249 each these tickets werent cheap but if you are planning on riding all of the rides in one day this is ultimatley the way to go.First off we were the first people to enter the park which was pretty cool and we could see the crowds amassing outside the gates, as soon as the park opened everyone began rushing towards X, but due to our VIP privaleges we were able to take a leisurley stroll to the ride. Once there our tour guide Jessica took us up the exit of the ride and asked the ride controllers to hold the front row of the next train, this was getting good! in little more than 2 minutes we were on the ride and as soon as we had finished we had another go straight after no questions asked.The VIP ticket is incredible, it allows you to have free food and drink all day and even have your own VIP room in restaurants, you only have to ask and you will recieve, you are also allowed to play all of the fair ground style games within the park for free and as many times as you like, but by far the best part of the deal is the ability to walk up the exits of rides and jump straight on the front as many times as you like, you are also able to experiance Dive Devil and Thrill Shot for free, both of which you would usually have to pay $35 for.On the day we were there only Deja Vu was closed out of the rollercoasters, but both my dad and i rode all the remaining 15 rollercoasters 2 or 3 times everytime in the front.Be prepared to walk a long way around the park as the park is built around a mountain it is rather hilly and also the park is massive meaning a large walk between rides, but when you are an adrenaline thrill junkie like myself it doesnt really effect you.The rides in the park are the most intense rides I have ever ridden, all of them impressed me and i dont think ive ever been so tired out from riding rollercoasters all day.As we mainly went for the rollercoasters I cannot comment on the other rides but they all seemed pretty good. Also as the Six Flags company is now under new ownership the promblems previously mentioned about litter and gangs etc seem to be non existent. All the staff are extremley friendly and helpful and this was extremley appreciated.All in all this was the most awesome day ever and I would highly recommend it to anyone planning on visiting the park, you may aswell have the whole place to yourself as it certainly seems that way. I cannot recommend this enough and I am already planning on going back in a couple years time with my mates to take advantage of this awesome package.The tickets have to be ordered in advance and beware that no refund is given if you are not able to make it, however they will arrange the day in these circumstances.---",Dribben
50,Best Coaster Anywhere,"My husband & I had not visited this park for over 20 years and we were worried about all of the reviews of the park being run-down and full of gang members. This was the first trip with our kids (13 & 16). We had such great memories of this park when we were their ages, that we really wanted this to be a great trip for them - and it was! We were VERY relieved to find the park in great shape, and the guests were the typical collection of CA teenagers dressed in the latest street-wear. Nobody should expect to see little girls wearing princess dresses here. This is a park for BIG kids. The park was clean, the landscaping was well maintained, and the atmosphere was fun and friendly.We visited MM on a Sunday and expected long lines for Spring Break, but didn't have ANY trouble. Thankfully, we didn't feel any need to purchase (yes, I said PURCHASE!) - the FlashPass ($20 extra) because most lines were only 10-15 minutes! We got to the park right as the gates opened and rode""X"" and Tatsu first - AWESOME! By 2pm we had ridden ALL of the big coasters at least once! The longest line was for Riddler's Revenge - which is a fun coaster but the line for the ride is poorly organized and the loading/unloading took way too long. Not worth waiting for a second ride. I'd say Scream was my overall favorite - fun & fast, without being TOO crazy! Our son liked Revolution (old but still fun), our daughter's favorite was Batman (it made me dizzy!), and my husband liked Goliath the best! Overall, we had a fantastic day at this AWESOME park. Now our kids have the same great memories of MM as we do. We'll definately go back. Ya, some of the prices are outrageous, but if paying a little extra for parking means that they'll be able to keep this park open, then I'm willing to fork it over. Can't wait to go back!",Traveling Trish
50,Scream your head off,"We enjoyed our day at Six Flags Magic Mountain immensely. Our kids are 18 & 20 and are over the tame, kiddie rides, so this park was perfect for them. And for my husband and I. There is one insane rollercoaster ride after another. Great excuse to scream and laugh your heads off. 250 foot drops, 85 miles per hour, loops, sharp banked turns, G-forces, everything. Loved it.We were there February 12th so the lines were minimal. The park is no Disneyland. Not as glossy and perfect, but enjoyable nevertheless. As one other reviewer has said, some of the park patrons might look like gang members, but that's what many local teens look and talk like. They're just ordinary folk in a diverse country.The $15 parking fee was steep. Look for Internet deals to get in the park. We paid $34.99 each. Food is expensive - $4 for corn on the cob. So eat a good breakfast beforehand, unless your stomach can't handle that. Our stomachs were just fine. But if you're a queasy type, perhaps some of those rides aren't for you whether you eat beforehand or not. I felt a bit dizzy after some of them, they were that wild.Overall, we felt it was well worth it, considering all we were looking for was one thrill ride after another.",SunsetCoaster
50,The best rollercoasters in the U.S.!,"We travel to Magic Mountain every 5 years or so, and were prepared for the worst after reading some recent reviews. I am pleased to report that we had a fantastic experience on a February Sunday. We traveled with two teenagers, two children under two, and four adults, and everyone had a wonderful time. The park seemed quite well kept up, and while some rides were closed (Psyclone and Deja Vu permanently, Superman temporarily) the ones that were operating were fantastic. We rode Goliath twice with barely any lines. The longest line was about half an hour-it was for Tatsu, which was well worth the wait. (X opened toward the end of the day, but I didn't personally ride it on this trip.) The small children had a blast in the kids' play area, and the more timid of the two teenagers enjoyed the Gold Rusher and the log ride, among others. Of course, things like parking ($15) and bottled water ($4) are ridiculously expensive, but that's to be expected at amusement parks.As a side note, I think that reviewers who fret about ""visitors who look like gang members"" just aren't accustomed to dealing with youth from the diverse cultures that occupy California. Sure, the crowd was diverse, and decked out in various pop-culture fashions, but I saw no activity even remotely shady or suspicious. There is a big difference between appearance and actual gang activity, and there are metal detectors at the gate anyway. I wouldn't worry about it.Now that Six Flags has sold off some properties and decided to keep Magic Mountain open, I'm sure we'll see improvements and more wonderful rides in the future. Don't come expecting a Disneyland-type ""total entertainment experience,"" but if you're visiting the park to ride the best coasters in the west, this is the place for you!",Twirlgrrl
20,Knotts Berry a better day out,"Visited in September 06 from U.KComparable to Blackpool Pleasure Beach, but not as much fun.The day we went to the park was quiet, but running of rides was quite slow.X, Viper, Deja Vu and Colossus were closed all day.Longest waiting time was for rapids ride, about 30 mins.The rollercoasters overall were not up to much, usually very fast and twisty, with no actual thrill or memorable parts to them.Stand out rides were Goliath, the tall steel coaster and Revolution. There isnt much apart from rollercoasters and its a bit disappointing when several are closed.A word of warning, the food is absolutely revolting and incredibly expensive.Id recommend Knotts Berry for a better value day out with better rides.",Mattf
40,Pleasantly Pleased,"We almost changed our plans to visit Magic Mountain during our week long trip to Anaheim after reading some of the reviews in TripAdvisor. We decided we would go anyway.We were very pleasantly pleased. Every worker that we saw was clean cut and pleasant. The grounds were clean and the rides looked well taken care of.You can research the rides and what's going on at the Magic Mountain web sight before going, also tickets are cheaper if you buy them on the web sight.We went the Sat. after Thanksgiving and had a wonderful time! I would recommend Magic Mountain, and if you decide to go we hope you have a great time too!",ohprettygood
30,Go for Coasters ONLY,"If you love rollercoasters this is the place to go. But that's it. The staff is mostly young, undertrained and slow. We went on 11/19/06, so it was off season. First off, be prepared to pay $15 for parking when you arrive. For whatever reason, they don't include parking in the $60 per person admission fee! So you're out $75 before you even get on a ride. The lines weren't very long since it was off season, however at least half of the places to eat were closed. There were VERY long lines at a few food booths that offered mostly fried food (chicken fingers, fries, soda) all at astronomical prices. $3.50 for a bottle of soda that costs $1 on the outside?? Don't they make enough revenue between the admission and parking? Your best bet is Panda Express, for a full and somewhat balanced meal. The family in front of us had purchased coupons and after ordering all their meals were told they didn't accept them. Not very good communication with the restaurants, I guess. The poor family had to walk away and figure out where to eat. The map they provide you with isn't very good - the rides and restaurants and other locations aren't numbered clearly and whenever we got to a ""you are here"" type of map posted, there were plenty of people with puzzled looks on their faces trying to figure out how to get around. The park is unkempt. Though I'm sure a lot of this has to do with all the kids who simply don't know how to use a trash can (blame the parents for that one), but the ""staff"" just don't seem to care. Are there no supervisors working on weekends? On the couple of water rides we were on, whenever we passed an area that had a ""monitor"" standing by, supposedly for safety, it was usually some young person reading a book, talking on their cellphone or just simply ignoring us. What if there was a problem? The rides, overall, are great. If you love fast and high rollercoasters, enjoy. But for $75, I expect SERVICE. There is security check-in when you arrive, including bags searched and walking through metal detectors. It's like going to the airport. I had heard about gang activity which probably accounts for the security measures, and I'm glad to report we didn't see any trouble. But I guess all their money went to those metal detectors, they certainly cut back on quality.",Rendvs

40,Not polished but it has the rides,"We visited this park in July. We were advised that as we were travelling without our kids we should go to Magic Mountain instead of Knotts Berry farm.We took a tour booked via Starline which included entrance tickets and the transport to the park. The downside was that the coach would depart at 5:00 pm so we had to get our skates on.Alas you get searched upon entrance to the park, which slows you down immediately. Its rumoured that gang fights sometimes take place. Maybe the Mickey Mouse club have a tendency to rumble with the Bugs Bunny brigade.The theme park is not as polished as the House of Mouse. You will find staff with tattoos and beards here, and some staff are a bit clueless. The park also needs a spring clean and a lick of paint.But anyone from the UK who have to put up with travelling funfairs and staff at British theme parks, this is still a cut above.However the sign posting is awful and the maps they handout are regarded as being wrong. You will walk around in circles trying to find things.We quickly upgraded out tickets to VIP status. It cost a lot of money but as I said we had a limited amount of time and some of the queues were already over 2 hours.The VIP ticket gives you faster entrance to most of the rides. One ride where there was no VIP tickets accepted we got in as single riders where you are slotted on an empty seat. This was faster than the VIP pass. My wife and I got on this ride in less than five minutes, we just did not sit together.At Magic Mountain the roller coaster is king. In that respect it beats Universal and Disney with their hyped up rides hands down.As we sat on so many coasters in such a short space of time that by early afternoon motion sickness was fast approaching. Maybe we're just getting old.Also I also had a bit of back strain from the wooden coaster rides. And you thing the Wild Mouse at Blackpool is bad!With a VIP pass you also get some coupons giving you discounts and some freebies. But some shops in the theme park did not accept them or had a clue as to what they were. (An issue about staff training).Its not a place for kids even though they feature Warner bros character's very heavily.We did not see any of the shows, the buffet lunch we get free with our VIP ticket was something to forget, but we are glad that we went.If you see any of these World scariest coaster type TV shows, then you know that Magic Mountain attractions feature heavily on this programmes. That ultimately is its best recommendation.",PrestonGuild
10,"Don't expect to find any ""Magic""","We just got back from Six Flags Magic Mtn. in California. Thought we would go on a Monday (Oct 2) to stay away from the crowds. Our excitement quickly faded when the first ride we chose was closed. We then got in line for Tatsu which ran the first hour empty! So we left the line to head to Nija…which was closed. Off to the next ride Dejavu, it was fun except we had to wait 15min to get off as it broke down and we were stuck in our seats. Overall, we were very disappointed in that most of the rides were closed. We were told by an employee that they were having staffing problems and most of the rides would be open around 1pm. That never happened. We rode a couple of coasters, stood in line for 45min for a burger then headed back to Tatsu. After waiting in line another 30 min (it was going around empty..again!), they finally allowed riders on. And THAT is when the entire park lost power!!! No backup generators so people were stuck on the rides for about 45 min. Everyone else started leaving.What did we get for our trouble? A free pass that expires at the end of the year. We flew from out of state, spent over $1,000 to get the family there…this pass is no good to us! All these troubles aside, we felt the park itself was looking run down. Is all the money going into the new multi million dollar coaster and none of it to giving the park a face lift? Everything was faded and the bathrooms were nasty.I would not recommend as a family destination. Was not worth all the money we put into it. Next time...Hawaii!!!",mellow144
50,not for faint hearted,"this park is amazing value, fantasic day out with about 15 or more huge rollar coasters. The rides are huge and really scary if you love rollar coasters this is for you ! Tasu the new ride was terrifying and the older superman was great to.",dillojs
40,It is what it is:,"Six Flags is all about coasters. I'm not going there for an Italian meal or to watch an opera. If you like coasters then this is the place for you. I was a little surprised there was a low review for Six Flags and the reason was 'there is only coasters.'That is what this place is about. (No offense intended)I'm not crazy about coasters, but my wife loves to go. If we are only talking about what this place is about, then Six Flags is definately above average from an unbiased opinion.",hasaccol
20,Be Careful Here!,"Our party of 11 including some teenagers went to MM in August. The lines were so, so long and they have the cheek to sell FastTrack passes at four rides for $15 whilst Disney give FastPass free. The staff never checked little kids for height restrictions and weren't even that great about checking restraints on rides. On Tatsu we had to ask!! So from a safety point of view, just be very careful here. Superman was loading and unloading so slowly (about 5 minutes each time) that we never bothered. Goliath is the best ride. We did X at night in the dark and it is very rough so watch out. Unless you are a hugh coaster fan don't waste your time.",plymouthtraveller1
30,Awesome Coasters- not much else,Past reviews pretty accruate. Several water fountains in park but found only 1 that worked and that water tasted pretty bad. Saw garbage all over that could have been picked up with about 5 extra workers for the entire park you would think????If you are going to ride awesome roller coasters then this is the place for you. If not then I wouldn't go.We did buy the flash pass and they worked ok for a few rides but the lines mid week were really low. If you go early or late probably not needed except for the new rides. I would go in the park and check out the lines first. The Flash Pass is available inside.Have fun,RentonRover
50,Awesome Day!!!!,"i read some of these reviews before i came to six flags MM and i was worried, beca use i live in canada and we came to vacation in cali with disneyland, universal and SFMM. Ive never been to six flags before so i was excited then i read some of these reviews, and i was a little worried. But we came and it was the BEST, we got there at 9:30 and rode the new coaster TATSU first, and we only had to wait like 15 mins, we rode like 11 other rides and we hardley had to wait in any line ups! Tatsu was the longest! walked on pretty much all of them. People were saying how dirty the park was, yeah i agree it's not as perfectly clean like disneyland and stuff but it didn't bother me the park was hardly dirty at all. And some were comparing it to disneyland, i wasn't expecting it at all so i was up for it. Here is my opinions on the rides i rode.TATSU- awesome ride, first ride i rode in SFMM 10/10VIPER- good ride has high fun loops and corkscrews 9/10GOLIATH- GREAT my FAV awesome hills 10/10COLLOSUS- Not so great, really bumby and old and loud 5/10SCREAM- Not a good ride for those who hate big looping coasters, but i thought it was pretty fun and good 10/10GOLDRUSHER- great classic 9/10SUPERMAN- LOVED not scary, its loud and funfunfun 10/10NINJA- great fun ride that swings in the trees and down by water 9/10JETSTREAM- Bumpy boats, but a good relaxing wet ride 9/10PHYSCLONE- HATE, if you love bumby wooden coasters, its the place for you but if your not i dunno, it thrashes you pretty good, i didn't like it a bit 2/10REVOLUTION- great i liked it cuz it had 1 small loop and it was cool going through trees and stuff 10/10i would advise you to go on tatsu first or X because of the lineups and go on sunday, we walked on pretty much all rides. go on a day thats cloudy and not rainy or blazing hot. I had a GREAT time and i hope that those people that didn't try it again at a different time cause it really is a blast, i loved it and DONT expect disneyland or universal. GO for the RIDES not the CLEANLINESS of the park.",arakv
20,Nothing but Coasters,"I was skeptical about some of the trip advisor reviews I had seen about Six Flags Magic Mountain saying that it was a dump since the Six Flags located near me (Six Flags New England) is actually quite pleasant and nice. Sadley to say, what they say is mostly true. YES, there are tons of coasters....And they are out of this world. But the Park falls short in all other areas, the staff was unfriendly (I understand we all hate our jobs and wish we were elsewhere) but the staff there seemed extra unapproachable and the park itself looked very trashy. There was little to no theming, no characters and landscaping needs seemed to have been overlooked for the past couple of years or so...Over grown trees and weeds everywhere.Also, the park is fairly big and fairly hilly. Take note if walking is an issue for you, the park requires a TON of walking with very little place to rest or scenery to enjoy on the trek. The lines were long as expected. We went on a Tuesday in June and managed to get on 4 coasters during our day long stay. You cannot take anything away from the Coasters, they were spectacular.... It just seems like a waste that the rest of the park was so poorly kept and boring.",ReeciePeicie
50,"Xcellent, Xtreme & Xhausting!","We spent two consecutive days at SFMM as part of our California & Las Vegas Road Trip visiting the park on Tuesday 6th & Wed 7th June. I had read all the reviews on this site beforehand and noticed the majority were bad, therefore I must admit I was slightly worried as to whether Magic Mountain would live up to my expectations....Did it??YES!!! Infact since coming back from our holiday I have read the negative reviews again and simply cannot believe its the same park in question!!Yes, I admit on arrival $15 for car parking is a tad steep, however we ordered our park admission tickets from the UK in advance and only paid £20 each, therefore weren't too bothered about the parking fee. Also when you consider the cost of theme parks in the UK and what they have to offer, you begin to realise how cheap SFMM is.As we entered the park dead on 10am (after some funky pre-opening entertainment) we noticed everyone rushing to the left for Tatsu, therefore we decided to venture right. First up Goliath - waiting time 0 seconds! (walked straight on) then onto Colossus - waiting time 0 secs!. Then on to Scream - waiting time approx 1 minute! Then onto Batman - walked straight on!. Riddlers Revenge - 10 min wait and by the time we had got to DejaVu the wait had only got to 30 mins which was nothing. When we arrived at Tatsu we waited about 1 hour, but considering the coaster was brand new it didn't bother us. Superman's queue was non-existent and we rode it 4 times in a row! X's queue was just over half an hour and we rode it a total of 5 times. Every coaster was open (apart from Flashback) and they were running 2 cars on all the big coasters. The ride attendants were VERY friendly to the point where they made conversations with us on virtually every ride (maybe it was our English accents they noticed!!)The rollercoasters themselves are out of this world - anyone planning to visit from the UK must do so, as we don't have anything on the same scale...Tatsu, Goliath, X the list is endless. The park was completely spotless and clean - we didn't notice any litter at all and we loved the park layout. The skyline is simply awash with huge rollercoasters and that whooosh from Superman can be heard from every corner of the park!The only negative point from our visit to the park which a lot of people have already mentioned was the line jumping which we did experience 2 or 3 times. Back home we would have said something but as we were guests in the US we just accepted it!As a UK resident used to the unruly behaviour, filth, lack of respect found at Blackpool Pleasure Beach and Alton Towers, Magic Mountain was in a completely different league. It's bigger, better, cleaner, less expensive and a must-do. We all came to the conclusion that we even enjoyed this park more than Islands of Adevnture and thats saying something!",Journey29979
10,Terrible Day,I am from michigan.. so im a season pass holder yo Cedar Point.. but i wanted to go to SFMM because its kind of like cedar point with the roller coasters.. so we went to cali and i went to the park.. its filthy.. everything just seems so unorganized and a mess. Lines were soo long and the prices were terrible. The only good rides really were X and Goliath. So im sitll sticken with Cedar Point.. its spotless there well organized and the employees actually seem like they want to be there. Tickets are only $39 and SFMM were $59 and it should be other way around. CP should be that high and SFMM should be $39 due to the poor coinditions of the park.,LoveTravel30639
30,Good park but need improvements,"Spent the day here in the middle of May and even though their are problems with the park a good day can still be had here.Bad things first-Parking at $15,Entry to the park at $59 per personWhile we were there 4 rollercosters was'nt working (no-one said this when we payed for our tickets) Superman being one of them,a huge disappointment considering that was the one i was looking forward to riding on!Some of the older costers need to be replaced.Allot of the eating establishments in the park were closed too.Good things- The rollercoasters here are the best around especially Tatsu which for me was one of the best coasters i've ridden on and had only just opened.Their is quite a few smaller rides for the young children which is good.Even though parking is expensive there is plenty of space to park your car.Basically if your not a rollercoster fan than this is not the park for you (if you are than this can be heaven) but if your stuck on time and can't decided which park to go to give Magic Mountain a miss and go Universal Studios.",pete707
30,"Good, bad and ugly","Visited Jun 12-13, 2006. The good news is they seem to be making an effort to clean up the park. Additionally, even though they still limit their ride capacity (only one Superman coaster running with lines over 2 hours); most of the rides were at least functional. Parking is still bad. The freakish part is they have valet parking but that's not $15. Regular parking is now $15. Perhaps it's just me but parking seemed crowded and confusing-of course the young lady with whom I could not converse in Spanish, didn't help. The ugly is the way they structure their prices. Up until June 4 you could get a season pass for $59.95. Now (busy season) it's $69.95. Also, up until recently when you got a season pass they gave you a bonus coupon book FREE. Apparently a couple of days before we got there, they no longer GIVE you the book, now they charge you $20 for the Silver Pass which includes the season pass and the coupon book. What makes this particularly ugly is that many of the coupons have already expired. My discussion with guest relations led me to believe that they could use some adult leadership but, after all, it's NOT the Boy Scouts. It is still a great park for all varieties of roller coasters.",Night_Nurse007
10,Horrible horrible day,"We visited Magic Mountain on 24th May 2006 as the final part of our round trip from the UK to Vegas to California then back to Vegas and finally home to the UK.We totally love coasters and i'd always wanted to try Magic Mountain, so being in the state it had to be done. How disappointed we were, infact disappointed doesn't even scratch the surface. Things didn't start well when we were stung for $15 for parking! FIVETEEN DOLLARS! even Disney doesn't go that far.Immediately upon entering the park it looks dirty, this is carried on throughout the whole park, its absolutely filthy - there's litter everywhere. We stood in line for the new ride Tatsu for around 45 minutes, during that time were were subjected to people playing music outloud from their MP3 players, people totally ignoring the no smoking signs and smoking in the queue, people cutting in and holding line space for others & the staff just weren't interested.From Tatsu we walked over to Psyclone, i'd love to ride the real Cyclone at Coney Island so this was the closest thing to it! After walking through the line and getting to the station we found no staff and no trains on the track, we waited for a few minutes and some guy from DeJa Vu shouted over it wasn't running, no signs to say it was closed - absolutely nothing. From there we walked to DeJa Vu and stood in line (i use the term line loosley, it was more of a cattle market with no coordination from the staff at all), after waiting about 10 - 15 mins a member of staff announced the ride had broken down leaving the people on the ride stranded and they didn't have a ETA on fixing it.So we trooped off in search of another ride, as the temperature was now tipping 105F we decided to get something to drink, however all of the food & drink kiosks en route to Gotham were closed, the bigger places that were open wanted $4 for a bottle of water!!! absolute extortion. We walked over to Batman - The Ride and stood in line for that, the indoor queue system was littered with rubbish & there was no air conditioning or fans blowing so it became incredibly hot & stuffy - i felt faint at one point it was so bad.After struggling around the park for a bit longer we gave in and bought a couple of frozen lemondade cups which turned out to be basically ice with a light coating of lemonade syrup which lost their taste after 5 minutes.The queues were getting quite long now and i couldn't quite understand why all the rides except for Tatsu were only running one train. We stood for about 15 mins in line for Colossus, 15 mins for Scream then over 90 minutes for Goliath - with 1 train running, 2 sitting in the shed doing nothing, a monsterous queue, 1 member of staff running the show and she seemed more interested in getting Coke refills and running the ride. They could have so easily stuck another train on and cut the line time in half, instead of having hundreds of people stuck outside in the line melting under 105F heat. After Goliath we'd had enough and we hadn't even ridden X yet. The G-Force that Goliath pulls had almost made us pass out due to dehydration, we packed up and left mid afternoon.So there you have it, the park has a no smoking policy but nobody enforce it - expect people smoking around you in the lines, there's a no cutting in the line & holding place in the line policy but again nobody enforces it, the park is filthy, the staff are totally disinterested, the food & drink are extortiontely priced - Papa Johns was nearly $10 for a slice of pizza and a bread stick, a bottle of water is $4, frozen lemonade which really isn't worth it is $3.99 for regular (small) or $4.99 for jumbo (medium). And then there's parking at $15, stick that ontop of your $59.99 park entrance fee and you've got a mighty expensive day and really its not worth half that.",Graham H
40,More like 5 Flags!,"We visited the park on 27 April 2006 - it was easy to find just off the Interstate. Parking was expensive at $15, but there was plenty of space.Tickets were expensive on the gate - you can only buy them online if you live within 200 miles of the park - not very good for Overseas visitors. We bought $15 Flash Passes for Front of Line entry to certain rides - we didn't need these because the queues weren't too bad.The rides were very good, especially 'X' and 'Superman'. 'Deja Vu' wasn't working and 'Tatsu' wasn't open yet. Apart from the Rollercoasters there wasn't much else in the park for non-riders. The only show on was a very poor Parrot show - don't bother! There should be a Batman Stunt Show, but this and other shows are seasonal - it would be good to have this info on their website.As other people have said, it isn't in the best condition especially compared to Disneyland and Universal. The queuing areas on many of the rides, especially Superman, need a lot of work because they are looking rundown and unpleasant. The park map could be better and there aren't enough signs around to help you around the park.When we were there the Superman ride broke down a few times during the day. It was on top of a steep hill, and the only reason to go up there was the ride. It would have helped to have the attendant tell you it was broken at the bottom, rather than standing at the top - this would have saved a few climbs.Despite all this it was still a very good day - it is worth visiting the Park for the rides alone although if they added more shows it would be even better.",Norfolktravellers
40,Loved the Coasters!!! Had a BALL,"We went on Friday 6th May 2006 - married couple in late 20's/early 30's age group. We had an absolute ball, we went to ride X and did so 3 times. Wait was only 30 mins and got front row twice.We rode 9 of the 16 rollercoasters and all of them were excellent, the rollercoasters in america seem so much longer which is great. Riddlers Revenge was probably 2nd favourite to X and also loved Goliath.Dejuvu was closed which was only major coaster shut down and Tatsu opened the week after.The queues being a Friday not in school holidays were great, 30 mins max - and that was X.We got one free entry as well so 2 entries for $59.99 which was good value. Although parking was steep at $15.Burger King nearby had discount vouchers for $34.95 entry each. So worth stopping there for breakfast. The vouchers were just on counter.Our only issue was we nearly run out of petrol on LA freeway which was the scariest ride of the day!!! :)It did lack the ""magic"" and ""cleanliness"" of the Disney and Universals but if you want to purely enjoy great rollercoasters then this is your park!!Wouldnt recommend it to small kids, definitely a teenagers and older park. Its for Rollercoaster lovers as not many other type of rides.Had such a fun day there!! Would rank it on par with Cedar Point in Sandusky Ohio for best park I have been to for Pure Rides.",Onie13
10,A horrible day,"Our family were on holiday in California in March 2006, our sons and their girlfriends (all early 20s) were really looking forward to visiting Six Flags as they are all into rollercoasters. We got there early only to find that most of the big rides were closed. The food was worse than dreadful, large groups of intimidating youths were milling about the park. All in all ""A HORRIBLE DAY"" and a complete waste of money.",touchwoodjudith
30,I see the rides....but wheres the magic?,"Although I haven't been to many parks East of the Rockies (save those delightful Orlando-based ones), it's hard to argue that SF Magic Mountain isn't the coaster king of the world....and that's about all one can say for this park.On my 3rd visit here today in three years the awe of the huge steel coasters had worn off a bit and I was looking for an ""away-from-reality"" day. Unfortunately reality flows through the gates (i.e. visitors) and from the employees at every corner.The Good:- 16ish Coasters - what more can be said! If you're looking for thrills and don't mind annoyingly (and unnecessarily) long lines at some attractions, coasters like X, Goliath, Riddler's Revenge, Batman, Scream!, Viper, and others will blow your mind.- MooseBurger Lodge - although the AC was broken today (on a humid, 80 degree spring day), the food was fantastic once again and the servers were the best employees in the park. Save the $3.50 per soda and it's actually reasonably priced.The Bad:- Worn-down rides: Unfortunately the park seems to invest in raising parking prices ($15!!!!!!) and building new rides rather than keeping up the old ones. Even rides built in the 90's (e.g Batman and Riddler) have thick layers of french-fries grease, worn-out paint, garbage everywhere, broken lightbulbs, empty and ugly outdoor TV stations (in the ques), and horrible smells emanating from every corner. Batman, for example, appears to have once been one of the most originally and thorougly themed rides anywhere - now they don't even play the Batman theme in the Batcave! All the lights were out, the random TV screens were blank, and the fountain next to the line was overflowing everywhere. Come on Magic Mountain, have a little pride in yourselves.- The employees: Other than those at the MooseBurger lodge - and I'm not kidding here - I NEVER saw an employees smile in my 8 hours at the park today. Not once! Even at 10:05 when we pulled in, the parking attendant could barely acknowledge our existence (I guess those first 4 minutes of work were terrible for her). Ride operators rarely interacted with the crowds and were definitely more concered with themselves and their cliques than with us. SF: I'd be happy to put your employees through a ""Basic of Customer Care"" workshop!- The Lines: closely associated with the behavior of employees was the terrible way in which lines were operated. 1. No single-rider lines - at least 90% of trains had between 1-4 empty seats on them - sometimes even in the front. Come on now - there are plenty of ways to allieviate this, and a single-rider line is the simplist. 2. No fair FastPass system - as other have brought up about other parks, the pay-for-a-FastLane system creates an unequal social system at the parks. Those who can afford it use it, and those of us who cringe at the price of parking are left out to try. Disney's system is nearly perfect (letting each guest collect 1 FastPass every 4 hours) - it keeps people from standing in line, keeps them in the park (so they spend more money), and keeps them happy by giving an alternative to waiting 1.5 hours for a single ride.- The rest of the Park: Trash, poor themes, closed rides (prior to Memorial Day), loads of chipped paint, etc, etc, etc - not the most asthetically pleasing. The trees are nice, though.The Ugly:- I would estimate that 75% of the guests in the park are between 10-20. Nothing wrong with that except the behavior they bring - profuse swearing, line cutting, verbal brawling, etc. Now, I realize that most of the kids are find and dandy, but too many need a lesson in manners and courtesy (stop dropping F-bombs 3 feet from groups of 5 year olds!). I don't mind kids, I work with them, but many people will.- Hoochie Mama's with their Thugs - Make out sessions in the middle of public areas, too much skin showing, you get the picture. Plenty of these folks around.The Bottom Line:- Enjoy the rides, close your eyes, pinch your nose, and bring a pillow (for the lines - get it :).",Explorer24561
50,A Great Day Out,"We visited Six Flags on Monday 27th March 2006, the park was almost empty, as a result we walked straight onto all rides except X, where we had a short wait. The park was clean and tidy. The staff were polite and helpful. After reading some of the reveiws on this site we very nearly cancelled our visit to Six Flags, we are so glad we didnt. Compared to Alton Towers (Englands only comparison) Six Flags was supurb, no over inflated prices, a thrill ride around every corner and plenty of parking. All in all we had a great day. If your visiting LA, Six Flags Magic Mountain is a must, if only to ride X",o99y
20,"Six Flags Magic Mountain, is the magic gone?","Two recent visits to Six Flags Magic Mountain have left me wondering what has happened to Magic Mountain. Granted they have some of the best roller coasters, but rider production is wanting. Most especially ""X"", where is seems to never open on time. The riders per hour is slow due to the nature of the ride, however two cars does help. And what about De ja vu. I have not seen it open in 2006. Riddlers Revenge with one car running? Come on Magic Mountain management. Is the intent to keep people in the park longer, therefore giving them the chance to spend more money? Careful, your going public is smarter than that and if not satisfied your recurring customers may just stay away. I have also seen the park look more run down as each year passes. Is this reflective of the over all maintenance? I hope not. For Magic Mountain to have a flying coaster, that should hit the spot and is just what this park is missing as rides go. Hope the rider production is good on it. Scream is still a good ride, where the line is kept moving and for the most part the staff is nice...These comments are not just from a one time visistor to the park, but stem from nearly 10 years of going to Magic Mountain. You may get the public in, but can you keep them.",Seaside36550
20,Good costers - run down park,"While the rides are still fun, this is a reveiw of a once charming and fun amusment park, not the ridesIt had been 15 years since I went to Magic Mountain. I had read some of the on-line reviews, so I knew that the park is looking like it's 35 years.I heard that the park was trying to clean up it's act by stopping the 2 for 1 discounts and other tricks to put money back into the park..... I think they decided that they liked the extra money better and decided the simply pocket it.The parking is outrageous at $15.00!The park is filthy. Walkways, ride queues and rides themselves are littered with trash everywhere. We arrived when it opened and I have to assume that they never clean up the park overnight, because everything was dirty.The water rides smell. The water is grey and slimmy. All the water ride boats have 3-4 inches of water in them before you step in, so even if the ride doesn't get you wet, your shoes will be soaked.All day we never saw any park personel picking up litter or simply wiping down eating tables... it's definitly ""serve yourself"".As noted earlier, ride queues are long. Even the non coaster rides have 45-60 min waits. Most of this is poor line management. Confusing lines, Half empty cars because no one is in charge of helping user onto the ride, only off. Many of the rides are only running at 1/2 capacity even though it's obvious that if they added another staff member they could operate the othe 1/2 of the ride.The day we were there. Only about 1/2 of the coasters were in operation, so most coaster lines were running 1-2 hours.This is a real shame. The park still has a lot of potential to be brought back into shape. A thorough scrubbing and a new paint job would certainly be a step in the right direction. Since the park is geared towards the Teenage thrill seekers, I'm sure managment thinks that guests would rather have a new coaster every 3 years then a pleasent overall park experience.I know you can't go back in time, but this is an amusment park that makes no effort to keep up appearences.Anyone who hasn't been there for several years will be in for a big disappointment.",sorgan
40,More Fun Than Disney,"We weren't sure what to expect with several good reviews and several poor reviews. We enjoyed all the coasters and the park during our spring break stay and recommend it for those who like riding roller coasters. The staff was very friendly and helpful and the park was clean.Our only disappointments were that Deja Vu wasn't running at all during our trip and that on our first day in the park, X was 1hr late getting running so that put long lines at X and at the other coasters in the park.",mastaple
50,Better than Disney,"Hi all,hope that this will help you when planning travel to 6 Flags. I travel down to 6 flags from Vancouver at least once a year. Its the best. The coasters are thrilling and if you travel on weekdays during the school year the lines are next to none. Of course on the newest and best coasters you can expect to wait a little longer. I have been to 6 flags during the summer and the lines are much longer, but this is to be expected. Dont expect Disneyland with its great detail and tidy grounds. 6 flags is all about the rides. So get ready to have a great time. Get there early and pack a lunch in the car. Parking is under 10 dollars and you can usually get a 2 for 1 deal with a coke can or a gift pass from Burger King. Happy riding!!",cutienj
50,I love this place,"Growing up I had a great fear of roller coasters, not sure why, I was an active kid, loved hiking and jumping from rock to rock, doing jumps on my bike, but those things scared the heck out of me. When I was 28 I was dating a gal that was a roller coaster fanatic. We went to Magic Mountain and I was forced to ride with her, I was told I had to at least wait in line, if I didn't want to ride I could bail at the end, just just watch the happy faces as they got off and you'll want to ride to. So, I did. And I became a roller coaster junky.In 1996 and 1997 I had a season pass and would stop off at Magic Mountain when I would go to Las Vegas. Ride as many rides as I could in 2-3 hours and then continue my journey. One trip I was able to ride 12 rides (Superman, Batman, Colossus and Viper) in 2 hours. Many times reboarding an empty row without leaving the barn.In the past 2 weeks I went to Magic Mountain 3 times while I was in Simi Valley on business. The first day I got to ride Colossus, Ninja and Viper before my wife started to not feel good so we left. Good thing I have a season pass, I wouldn't like leaving after 90 minutes had I paid full price.The next week I arrived at 11:30 Saturday morning. It had rained earlier and the clouds were still threatening, so the crowds were non-existent. My kind of day.First ride was Viper, always a favorite of mine, 7 different types of loops and they come at you pretty quickly. Nest was Goliath, a very aptly named coaster, it's a GIANT. I had not watched it run before and was a little surprised when all that held you in was a lap bar, I thought for sure a ride this big had to have some loops, but no. It does have an AMAZING first drop and lots of places where you get negative G's. And one spin at the end when it feels as though your face is being lifted from your skull. You gotta love it, VERY smooth ride.On to Colossus, the only wooden coaster there worth riding. Sorry fans of Psyclone, but it feels like you've been in a car wreck after riding. I will never set foot on that brown beast again. I remember first seeing Colossus in 1976 when I was 12 and was terrified of it. Didn't ride it until 1996 and I love it. Lots of places on it when you feel like you're being lifted from your seat.Scream was next, first time on this very active coaster. I LOVED it. I like the coasters where your feet dangleand usually thay have the track above you, this one the track is below you. Which gives a completely different ride depending upon what row and seat you're in.Batman was next always loved this ride, once I was able to ride 5 times in a row without leaving the barn. At 6'1"" and 280# I'm almost too big to fit on this one. Combination of being tall and having a 52"" chest. But it is worth the confinement to ride this, very smooth and quite active.Riddlers Revenge, this is a great ride. First one I was ever on where you stand up. You're on a bicycle type seat with a shoulder harness. Lots of loops and drops on this ride.I then made the mistake of going on Psyclone, this thing is a bruiser.Deja Vu wasn't running and neither was Superman this day.Made my way back to ride Riddlers Revenge, Batman, Scream, Colossus and Goliath one more time. Total spent at the park 3 hours.",VegasMan
10,Waste of time!,"First of all, we made the mistake of visiting this park on Veteran's Day. It was packed with teenagers because there was no school. I have nothing against teenagers, but they were definately an interesting crowd.Our second mistake was going to Disneyland first, where they are experts on efficiency, cleanliness, and customer service. Magic Mountain was such a disappointment. The lines were very long and unorganized. After being there for six hours, we had only been on four rides. The ride operators seemed apathetic and bored. While waiting for Riddlers Revenge, there were mulitple seats that were unoccupied, and the operators made no attempt to fill them with single riders.Overall, Magic Mountain was run down and chaotic, the bathrooms were filthy and disgusting, and the food was way overpriced and of poor quality. We feel like we wasted a day of precious vacation and will never go back there again.",Exploration8218
10,"Great rollercoasters, long waits","Went to Magic Mountain on a Monday in July, hoping that this Six Flags would be better than others we've been to. The park was pretty empty until mid-afternoon, which was great. The rollercoasters were awesome, but once the crowd starts to pick up the lines are terrible. Even early when the park was empty we had some long lines because they seemed to be running a limited number of cars/trains on each ride. About half of the smaller rides were closed until night time. Once the crowd picked up the line jumping started, and the ride operators did nothing even if it happened right in front of them. And I really don't understand why they only had one tram running back and forth to the parking lot. If you really love rollercoasters and don't care about any other rides the come early on a Monday and you will probably get to most of the coasters after about 6-7 hours. We went to the Hurricane Harbor side of the park on Friday. We got there at 10:30, by 1:00 we had done only 3 rides. At this point my teenagers actually asked to leave! Absolutely the worst water park I've ever been to. The lines were horrendous. They did nothing to move them along - seemed to short on staff. They didn't let the next rider sit and get ready until the previous rider was completely out of the pool at the bottom. They had barely any tubes at each ride - so you had to rent tubes or you would have to stand in line at each ride twice (one line at each ride for a tube and another to get on the ride). Only water park I've every been at that people walk through the lazy river. Every other park the lifeguards make you stay on a tube. Here everyone walks and the lifeguards turn the other way when kids start wrestling in the water. Every time we went past the wave pool they had made everyone get out so that the lifeguards could swim back and forth across it. I understand water parks get crowded, we've been to water parks up and down the east coast, but this place was ridiculous. Everyone in my family agreed - we're not going to anymore Six Flags parks until they hire someone from Disney to show them how to properly run a theme park.",VacationCrazed
50,this park was awesome,This park was the bomb. im going to rate all of the coasters i went on. 1-5. ill start with viper. 4 this ride was awesome. I loved everything about it but it was very bumpy.ninja 2 this roller coaster was definately not worth the hill. The only reason the line is very short is because of the huge hill that no one wants to climb. Its about a mile long and the day was very hot so it made it worse. Goliath 5 this was my second favorite coaster in the park.It was amazing. The whole thing was worth the line.Superman. 3 This was an awesome ride but the line was way to long and the ride only lasted about 7 seconds. Batman 5 This coaster was awesome it was my third favorite coaster. Ridllers revenge 4 This was the best stand up coaster ive ever been on. Scream 3 this one was ok definately not one of my favorites. flashback 0 it was horrible. it was the only one in the park that i didnt like.And (drum roll please) x out of a possible 5 ide give it a 10 lol. This coaster was aawweessoommee I loved every part of it. i couldnt of thought of a better coaster. It was my favorite coaster in the park and my favorite roller coaster ever. The whole park i would give it a 5. the best day to go is on a tuesday. The lines were so short. The longest line was for x and it was about 45 min. the line was huge but it moved so fast.,Coastal37251
40,Hold on to Your Pants!,"As a Brit, and reading some of these reviews of Six Flags Magic Mountain all I can say is ""Please never visit Blackpool Pleasure Beach in the UK!"" Litter? Surly Staff? Thuggish guests? Greasy Food? Rickety rides? Believe me, America, you don't know you're born!We visited Six Flags in July. It was very, very hot and when they opened the gates it seemed everyone ran for ""X"" so we went in the opposite direction. As someone who is not a great fan of rollercoasters, I was soon thinking ""What am I doing here?"" as this park has some extreme and intense rides. ""Goliath"" gave me vertigo looking up at it. ""Scream"" is aptly named. ""Viper"" - I'd agree with other reviews in that it will seriously bounce your head around. ""Riddler's Revenge"" is a standing coaster, so don't look down! ""Superman"", well, if ""Goliath"" gave me vertigo this was twice the height. The water rides absolutely soaked us. ""Deja Vu"" was a long, long wait and over in seconds. And ""X"" is like going over a cliff in a tumble-drier on spin. Again and again.Queues weren't too bad, perhaps because we'd gone against the crowds. We managed about six rides in the first two hours, went into Valencia for lunch and returned to the park in the evening. We had a great time and I didn't notice a lot of the negatives other reviewers have posted. But then, I'm from Britain, and we just don't compete when it comes to places like this (Alton Towers aside).",uryjm
40,There's still Magic at the Mountain!,"Day of visit: Tueday August 9th, 2005The Crowd: mostly teens and twenty-somethingsBusy or not busy: NOT AT ALL busy!Average wait time: 10 minutes (or less!) for every ride except for XWeather: HOT HOT HOTHaving grown up going to Magic Mountain I was surprised that it had actually been 6 years since my last visit, so needless to say I was VERY excited to get the day started. First of all I will say that YES the park has gone down a bit, but NO it didn't keep my friend and I from having a blast! Basically the overall park appears neat and clean, some areas are definitely nicer than others. However there are certain older attractions that seem to have been neglected and are in dire need of a make-over. Upon arrival we ran to Batman and found ourselves buckling in within 10 minutes. Ok, I loved this ride when it was new and I still do...however do not sit in the back unless you want to feel like shock absorbers do not exist. It never used to feel so rough to me but there it is.Next we made way to Scream, a new coaster (to me) that I had never been on. I saw this one from the parking lot and didn't think too much of it... until we got close to it. Let me start by saying I have ALMOST NOTHING positive to say about this ride. Yeah it's a pretty color, and I like the fact there is no floor. Other than that I hate it. Let's just say it took my friend and I nearly 2 hours to feel normal again and NOT like we were suffering a bad case of the stomach flu. That ride is so confusing your brain never gets a chance to figure out what's happening! Ok, NEXT!After our 2 hour ""break"" we were back in action and on our way to Superman which I didn't ride due to the fact that it had already closed down a couple times due to technical difficaulties. I rode it the last time I was at MM though and I will say it leaves you with an amzing feeling! My friend however DID ride it (her first time) and she seemed happy with it. Next we rode Ninja (a favorite of mine) where we faced no line and rode twice in a row. Front seat is best on this one, trust me! On your way to the ride just ignore the poor conditions of the que because this ride still has it! Now for Psychlone, a beautiful wooden coaster with a lot of charm. I know a lot of people who don't like this one but if you like woodies you must ride it. Just watching it rattle and sway with each passage of train makes you think maybe, just maybe this might be it's last run. But it is just designed that way, so your safe...this time. OH, and take the front seat for a smooth ride with an awesome view. We only waited 10 minutes for this one.We took a lunch break and ate some of the best fries I have ever had. Go to the fresh cut fries stand near Goliath and take them to a seat in the messy but air conditioned food court across the way. YUM. For a nice post-meal ride we chose Bucaneer which of course is never busy and we walked right on. This one's still fun to me...maybe I'm sentimental. Since Goliath was closed all day (I'm still upset I missed it, Ive never been on it) we headed toward X. Just so you know, I had NO intention of going on this ride but my friend is braver than I so we waited in line for maybe an hour (the longest wait). As it was time to board the ride, they announce technical difficulties. At that point I was glad I wasn't going on it. In about 15 minutes X was back in action and my brave friend boarded the ride, alone, in the back. All I can say is that I have never seen coaster passengers look quite this pale! haha. And somewhere during the ride they snap an oh-so flattering photo of you mid-scream. My friend actually bought hers...she HAD to, it was the funniest photo we had ever seen. She looked TERRIFIED and it gave us great laughs for the rest of the day! Oh yeah, and she said she loved the ride, well worth it in her opinon. For the rest of the day we rode oldies but goodies such as Log Jammer (no line) , Jet Stream (no line) , and Goldrusher. Goldrusher is one of those ride you have to ride, it's almost pleasant. So pleasant in fact we rode it 3 times in a row (no line) and found it funny that the few people who DID ride it were just merrily carrying on conversations mid-ride. Too funny. Unfortunately Colossus was down but that is a true classic that is still frighteningly fun! The rides I would stay away from are Riddler's revenge, due to the creative yet painful seating, Scream, as mentioned above, and some of the carnival type rides that only spin you into a nauseating oblivinon. Other rides I didn't mention above but are definitley fun are Viper, Roaring Rapids, and Revolution (except for the uncomfortable and tight seating. And in case your wondering why I didn't mention Deja Vu well here's why. This ride appears to be an accident waiting to happen. We watched the riders get strapped in with 3 different restraints which makes this one a slow loading ride...prepare for a long wait. But it was actually while I was watching the ride that I felt sick thinking about those people hanging face down for what seems like forever on the high towers. This is not for me. I did talk to some people who rode it and more than one person felt totally miserable and like their restraints were not safe. One person actually went into an anxiety attack while waiting at the top of the tower. Again, not for me. All in all I LOVE MM and had an awesome time, better than I expected seeing as how this IS August! My friend and I felt we got to ride everything we wanted and never had to suffer a long line (not including the wait for X). Go on a Tuesday or Wednesday during the summer and you will have a fun filled day without all the stress of over-crowding. My fabulous day at The Mountain leaves me wondering why I let 6 years go by without a visit to the amusement park of my teenage years.....we wont let this happen again! I'm considering a season pass.....",Extraordinary21578
20,"Rides are awesome, park is a dump!","Haven't been to MM for twenty years, now I have teens of my own and they really wanted to go. The rides did not disappoint, we went on every coaster atleast twice. The lines for X and Deja Vu were long but we figured out how to avoid the wait, go up the exits, Deja Vu has a single rider line there and the attendent put all four of us on together. X has lockers up on the ride platform, which you can access from the ride exit. We simply got off the ride and walk right back into the line. People thought we were using the locker and the lines to get onto the ride are so disorginized that noone knew where we came from. There are no attendents at the front of the line, only at the coaster.Psyclone, the smaller wooden coaster was horrible. The restraint bar got pushed down so tight, on both my daughter and I, that we had bruises on our legs, and this happened when the ride was already moving and we had to ride the whole thing in pain.Viper is another one I would not recommend. I'm small and I got knocked all over the place. The restraint was an over-the-head kind and I literally got whiplash and head trauma.On the day we were there, July 18th, 2005, it was 105 degrees. Some of the lines had water misters, which was nice. We found an air-conditioned food court over by the Goliath entrance. There was a Japanese sushi chef making fresh sushi (12 pcs. California roll) for under $7.00. It was really good and we rested in there for about 1 hour. The inside was a dirty pigsty but we were desperate for a cool place to sit.The grounds are a complete dump, there was so much trash around the rides and while in line for X I looked up noticed what looked like a drip pan above us and where the drip pan ended further up there was black grease all over the steel poles. This park really needs a good cleaning up. There was gum everywhere, on some rides the steel poles along the lines were covered with chewed-up gum balls, some up 15 feet in the air, like it was a competition to see who could get theirs the highest.MM is still doing the 2 for 1 deal, just bring a empty coke can. Otherwise I couldn't fathom paying $47 per person.MM is like the bad boy of all the So. Cal. amusement parks, and it holds up to its name.",Kauailuvr
40,Better than I expected!,"Visited Magic Mountain July 3rd, 2005. The drive up from Orange County early on a Sunday morning was easy, 80+MPH almost the whole way. Picked up a can of coke to take advantage of the ""buy one, get one"" admission special. $48 for my sister and I together wasn't a bad deal at all, and since we expected huge lines on a holiday weekend, we purchased the $15 each ""fastlane"" passes as well. These are slightly misleading - you are told up front that certain attractions (X and Deja Vu, for example) do not have fastlane access, but you aren't told that the passes are limited. You only get four fastlane trips per $15, but the $2.75 per ride for almost-immediate access to some of the best rides is certainly worth it. In fact, without the Fastlane pass, you'll probably not be able to ride all of the coasters in a single busy day at the park.Interestingly enough, the park wasn't all that crowded. I guess people either came Saturday (I talked to a few cast members who agreed) or were waiting for the big Fourth of July celebration on Monday. X was the biggest line of the day - 45 minutes and we were on. Incredible, disorienting ride and the first coaster I've ridden in a while that really gave me second thoughts as I was cresting the first hill before that awesome drop. If we didn't have ~12 other coasters to ride, we would have tried to ride X a few more times. Oh - and the standard answer from the cast members when asked how long a line is? ""Two hours."" Don't believe it.This park is in serious need of upkeep. There are a few bright pockets where things look pretty nice - the flowers near the entrance to the Colossus County Fair, the ""kiddie"" area, and some of the theming in the Gotham area. And most of the walkways were fairly clean. But there's a ton of trash (bottles, wrappers, clothing, gum) in places there shouldn't be, like some of the water features near Revolution, for example. I saw ONE guy with one of those little dustpans; seems to me they could hire about 39 more.Also, there's plenty of places that need some paint. It looks like they put a ride up and then don't bother maintaining the cosmetics or theming - Ninja and Superman, for example, can both use some serious TLC. For the latest rides (Scream, X) there's precious little theming. I did enjoy the theming on Batman and Riddler's Revenge.Overall demographic, as others have mentioned, seems to be the 15-30 crowd. Very few families. That being said, I saw no line cutting, no violence, little pushing and shoving, and heard very little profanity. People were actually pretty considerate and nice - even the employees were, on the whole, pleasant.The food looked uniformly awful and exhorbitantly priced. We did actually eat vegetable sushi in the ""food etc."" food court. Believe it or not, this was pretty fresh, the healthiest choice we could make, and reasonably priced.Four stars just because this park has some of the best coasters I've ever ridden. If it werent' for the sheer number and quality of coasters, this park would get two stars. High points were X, Riddlers, and Colossus. Letdowns (for me) were Superman and Psyclone. The only ""major"" coaster that wasn't operating was Flashback, and I was interested in riding that just because of the novel design. All coasters were running with at least two trains, except for Deja Vu (because of design) and Gold Rusher. We ended up using Fastlane for Goliath, Riddlers, Scream, and Viper, and did the ""single rider"" line for Deja Vu (and got right on.)",Global34301
50,THRILL SEEKERS***GO TO THIS PARK******,"Visited the park 05/11/2205. Arrived and was one of the first 25 people in park on this quiet day. The only line all day was for the ""X"". This is the first ride we did and got right on. This is the BEST ROLLER COASTER I HAVE EVER BEEN ON. This is the BEST ROLLER COASTER I HAVE EVER BEEN ON. I had to say it twice. This park has several GREAT coasters not just good ones. We paid $28/ea for tickets (BARGAIN)!! The Goliath was my second fav followed by Deju Vu and on and on. The key is get there early and go on a slow day. Skip a day of work or school.....worth it. I did not ride any water rides cause I didn't want to walk around wet all day and I ate no food. But I did ride every open coaster and that's the reason I went. Kudos to staff for this great park. DEH",yankee-peddler
30,"Coasters that thrill, service with a chill","I have a hard time give this a rating out of five. If you love coasters then it could be a five for you. If you expect friendly, english speaking staff and a disney like experiance it is a 1 ro 2. I would put it between 3 and four. The thing with six flags is to go prepared and have your expectations in the right place. This is an Xtreme park. It is all about the coasters. You will love the coasters and not be dissapointed.My experiance.I ordered a season pass on-line (I am from canada) and they mailed it to me. This was my best deal. My wife and I went and with a season pass (same cost as one admisssion) you also get a coupon booklet. This booklet gives you a free entry for a companion. So my wife got in free. We alos used the free parking coupon and save another $9 (rip off) to park. We also had 25% off in the looeny tune store which my wife used. The bad side is they only sent a coupon for the season pass and I had to stand in line for 40 minutes upon arrival to get my picture taken for my pass.The staff. I am all for employing immigrants and all ethnic groups. However if they are in apublic place, serving the public, it would be nice if the spoke or even understood english. Many had no idea what I was asking and would shrug there shoulders and walk away. On Superman, a staff person started yelling at me. I thought I had done something wrong until he came and showed me he wanted me to sit in a different spot. I found it frustrating to say the least. Many who spoke english to some degree had no idea where things were. In other parks any staff you walk by smiles and says hi. Here they look away and avoid your questions.The Rides. WOW now here we were not dissapointed. CRAZY RIDES. Some of the best coasters I have ever been on. It was only the second Monday they had been open during the spring season and we had the park to ouselves. Most rides I was in line for less than 5 minutes. I heard what I assume were regulars commeting in amazement at the speed of the lines.On Goliath my favorite, I walked on. I heard the person behind me say that they waited over 2 hous the last time they were here. I would not have liked that. I rode 8 rides in the morning. I could have done more but the park is spread out.We ate at the moose lodge and used yet another coupon. It was actually not a bad meal with large portions.I have read comments thtat the park was not clean. We thought the park was clean. A couple areas could use paint but no big deal.If you love coasters, and don't need any service then you will love it. Keep reasonable expectations in mind and you will be ok. Do not expect disney.",Bubbavon
20,Disappointing & Dirty,"I don't know if people still come to California with the express desire to visit Magic Mountain. Heck, did they ever?It has always been a second-rate amusement park and now, owing to the general condition of the rides & grounds is worse than a sub-par county fair.Which is sad as it used to be a really fun place to visit.I've lived in So. Cal my entire life and I've watched SFMM go from a really nice park to a place I wouldn't board my dog.Rides:The rides are very good. Goliath scares the living daylights out of a body with its seemingly under-sized passenger cars. Colossus is definitely showing its age, but is still a classic wooden coaster experience. Most of the other coasters are outstanding as well. I would avoid Viper as it knocks your head around something fierce.The Grounds:Dirty, filthy & unkempt. The buildings look old & un-cared for. Paint faded & peeling.The Food:Forget it. Eat at Marie Callender's, El Torito, Hamburger Hamlet or one of the other chain joints located on The Old Road by the enterance to the park before you arrive. There used to be a half-way decent steak house up on top of the hill. Now it's a crummy pizza joint.The Clientele:Thugs, gang-bangers, & other assorted low lifes. This has been one of the park's problems since the early 80's. Because it caters to the thrill-seeking crowd, it also draws its share of miscreants as well.Summing up:If you're an out-of-stater looking for fun I'd go to Disneyland or Knotts before I'd go here and I only live about six miles from Magic Mountiain.",Jeremy Crockett
50,Great time on an April Monday,"We visited Six Flags Magic Mountain on a Monday. There were no crowds and no evidence of a rough element that I read about. We didn't need to purchase the ""Fast Pass"". We managed to make 20 rides on the 15 of 16 major rollercoasters operating, in four hours. Lines were so short, one could ride the many rollercoasters twice in a row.We started with the ride ""X"" and moved around the park in a counter clockwise direction. Since the weather was a little cool, we did not ride any of the log flumes.We have a season's pass from Great Adventure in Jackson, NJ, so the visit did not cost extra. Six Flags clothing was a bargain, with a quality t-shirt for $9 and a heavier weight shirt for $16.After our visit to Magic Mountain, we had lunch in the Salt Creek Grill in Valencia. We ate in the bar, where the food was well executed. A cob salad, calimari, with two softdrinks ran about $25, with tip.",Companion32461
10,Xtreme Disappointment!,"Myself, my husband and two children, ages 12 and 15 and two friends, decided to go to Six Flags in the middle of our second week of spring break. I thought that it may be a little crowded, but I knew that many schools had probably started back in session. I wanted to get a 2 for 1 deal at the park, so I didn't go on line to get the tickets. Well this was a mistake. If you're not the first 20 people in line when the ticket windows open, forget it! We arrived in the parking lot at 10:15, stood in line from 10:30 until 1230, just for tickets! Just ONE single file line! Who hired these people anyway?We went clockwise in the park on the advice of my 15 year old to ride the X first to get that over with, since we knew that a longer line may be there. That was a big mistake! GO COUNTERCLOCKWISE ALWAYS! When we started at the line the attendant Jonathon gave no mention that only one coaster was running. How could he have stood there and told us that it may take over an hour! Who hired this guy? After the first hour and a half, we finally got up to where we discovered there was only one coaster running. We were crazy to stay in line! AFTER 4!/2 HRS, 45 min in the shelter alone, we finally got to ride. The rest of the park was fun. DO NOT RIDE THE X. IT WILL STRESS YOUR WHOLE TRIP OUT AND RUIN IT, NOT TO MENTION ITS A KILLER AND VERY UGLY INSIDE the shelter. The park made a mistake when they spent millions of dollars on this coaster. NO FUNNNNN. Also the attendants were extemely inefficient here. Maybe if the wages went up for the employees and managers existed at the rides. customer satisfaction would improve. Have you looked at the negative reviews lately?",Climber35281
10,Xtreme Playpass a Scam,"I visited MM today for the first time, and to say that I was extremely disappointed with the abominable service would be an understatement. Planning on visiting the park several time this year, before going, I shelled out $250 for two Xtreme Playpasses so that I wouldn't have to wait in lines (this pass supposedly gets you four ""fast lane"" tickets on ""every"" visit to the park). Upon arrival, I went to guest relations to get my fast lane passes, and they told me that they had sold out of them, and none were available (the park sells the fast lane passes to regular one-day visitors for $15, and only sells a limited number of them). My point was that they should have allocated a certain number of these passes for people with the premium Xtreme Playpass, because we had already paid good money to get the right to those passes on any day that we visit the park.After literally one hour of arguing, they refused to give me the fast lane passes, to which I had a clear contractual right. Each person i talked to sent me to somebody else, and finally, when I spoke to the person supposedly in charge, they just handed me a piece of paper with an address on it (no phone number) and told me to write to that address with my complaint, despite her acknowledgement that I was right.Point blank, I have never been treated so poorly by a customer relations staff in my life. If you are thinking about buying an Xtreme Playpass, think twice - don't believe them when they say that you get front of the line tickets on every visit - you may not, as I did not today.If anybody else has had this problem, please let me know. My e-mail is ---. If I don't get my money back by filing a complaint with my bank (I paid for the tickets with my debit card), I plan on filing a lawsuit for breach of contract.",Explore6318
40,roller coaster shangri-la,"It would be easy to list many negatives, but if your focus is thrill rides, this place is unbeatable.Here is the correct way to visit the park on a crowded day, in my opinion: Get there early and be at the gate at opening so you can run in and ride X, and then Superman and Deja Vu(If you don't mind starting off with three of the really good ones). Then make use of the rest of your early time to get on other big rides that will soon fill up. Now enjoy your lunch of $7 greasy fries with melted cheese food, elbow to elbow with the chubby bare-midriff teen and her scowling, skinhead boyfriend, OR get your handstamped, take the 5 minute walk back to the car, and enjoy that turkey on rye with sundried tomatoes and Sierra Nevada Pale Ale you've got stashed in the mini-cooler in your car. Or just drive out of the park and get your fast food elsewhere, remembering to keep your parking stub. Take your time, then return to the park, and smile at the teeming crowds of unwashed Southern Cal youth as you waltz by them with your FastLane tickets you bought earlier. Use your fastlane tickets, bypassing the two hour lines, suppress the guilt and get on Viper, Goliath and Riddlers Revenge, and one more of your choice. You only get four rides with FastLane, and X, Superman, and Deja Vu are unavailable, but you are not going to want to miss or wait in afternoon lines for Viper and Goliath.Follow this plan and you will enjoy MM to its fullest.",BackPacker1970
40,Very fun and enjoyable if going off season.,"Most people want to experience their vacation during the summer and who wouldn't. The sun is shining, all the the rides are open, special events are occuring, and you are having the most stressful day of your life. Seriously, you do not want to go to Six Flags Magic Mountain any time from June to August, it is a lone line nightmare. Why not just take a mild, off season day (from September to May) and actually enjoy your experience or ""Xperience"" as they say in Magic Mountain. I once went on New Years Day and it was perfect. The weather was cloudy yet not raining therefore scaring off locals exept myself assuming that there would be less people because of late night partying the night before. That day had five minute lines for the biggest rides and no stress at all. So in conclusion why not ask for those couple days off and take the kids out of school just for a little while and enjoy the park just the way you want it.",Ambassador35765
50,Loved the park!,I looked over the reviews at this sight alot and was very concerned we would not have a good experience at Six Flags in Valencia California but having two teenagers that really wanted to go we went for it. Well I just had to write this review to give Six Flags a great review! We had a wonderful time and we thought the park was looked after very well and loved the scenery of the park. It is beautiful with all the trees throughout it. We had read that there was no garbage cans throughout the park and that the park was not kept up and that there was alot of teenagers hanging around and budding into line. None of this is true at least not when we were there. You would think it would have been very busy being christmas vacation 2004 and high 70's low 80's for temperature but the lineups were great and we didn't have any problems with teenagers. I think when people go to this park they should not expect it to be like Disneyland they are completely different parks. I am not a roller coaster fan but did find that it had alot of rides for me and also for families that have little ones. We found a restaurant in the park too that was very good I can't remember the name but it is a log building with a moose theme by the little kids rides. It was a very good lunch with great talking mooseheads inside. If we ever make it back to California to go to Disneyland again Six Flags will be one of the parks we will visit as well again.,Venture6669
10,Big no no !!,"The rides are once in lifetime rides - you can't with sane mind go for it one more time. As good as the rides are, you can see everyone around you growing old waiting in the loooonnnnngggg lines !",Inspire19943
10,Total Pain,I thought this was going to be highlight of our vacation that included Disneyland and SeaWorld. Turned out to be a total nightmare and nothing when compared to the other two. This is the place for you if you are masochistic enough to enjoy 3 hrs queue wait in the hot sun. X and superman seemed like the best rides from outside but it takes 1 day to complete these two rides alone thanks to wait time.. ending up being the worst rides overall. Horrible Park officials/workers.. very cold and makes you feel that they are doing a favor by letting you in. Decided to not risk another day in Hurricane Harbor. Regret not going for California Adventure park instead.,Fearless32666
20,"Great Roller Coasters, Numerous Problems","I took a group of middle and high school students to the park, and they had a lot of fun. There were a lot of problems though.We visited on Sat. Aug. 14, 2004. We got in for half price with some tickets sent to the restaurant owned by one of the kid's father.This is definately a coaster park. The coasters are great, but there are two big related problems: long lines and breakdowns. I was stuck on the Revolution for about 10 or 15 minutes, and while I didn't experience it, some of the kids with me had their waits greatly lengthened when the rides they were waiting for broke down. All in all, breakdowns seem to be a big problem here.Another problem is line jumping. There are signs everywhere warning against it. There are a suspiciously large number of handicapped going to the front of the line on the more popular rides, especially the X, which had a three-hour wait! My son said one handicapped person was told he could go on the ride now, started to jump out of his wheelchair, then suddenly sat back down and allowed himlself to be wheeled to the ride.At several rides they handed out numbered tickets to discourage line jumpers. If your number was out of order when you got to the front, they wouldn't let you in. This seemed to help prevent line jumping. Why don't they give the numbers to handicapped people too, and have them wait in a holding area until their number comes up, so they have the same wait as everyone else? This would discourage people from pretending to be handicapped.I encountered short waits of 30 minutes or less on several coasters, including Scream, Collosus, and Ninja. If you don't try to go on the really popular ones, the wait isn't too bad.The park seemed clean enough to me. The staff actually seemed as good as Disneyland, where standards seem to have dropped somewhat.Since the park is near LA and draws from the local population, there seemed to be rather large number of rude, somewhat scary young poeple in the place.",everyguy
10,horrible horrible horrible,I have too say we were soooo disappointed with this park. We saved it for the end of our tour as a highlight and it was the lowest light of all. We should have guessed as soon as we arrived. the parking and transport into the park were totally totally inadequate. It was $46.99 each but we found out after we could have got in for half price if we had taken a coke can. but that wouldn't have made it any better. The park is dirty scruffy and downright disgusting and seems to atract the worst behaved youngsters I have ever seen. We go to theme parks quite regularly and are used to and prepared to queue but this was absolutely awful. Apart from one ride none of the others had queue time info which was extremely frustrating. none of the tv cameras worked which were supposed to keep the queues amused. Queue times took longer than necessary because of the amount of queue jumping by unruly youngsters with no respect especially when we tried to stop them. when we complained we were offered meal vouchers but when we went to the food outlets all of the above applied so we didin't bother. I would not recomend this park to any one unless you go for the rides and close your eyes to everything else. but it doesn't make for a plesant day especially for those on a family day out who like smaller rides.,colwells2
20,Roller Coasters Galore!,"Obviously all the money in this theme park goes to the rides, and nothing goes to architecture, landscaping, or even cleanliness. But that's fine, if you want roller coasters that's what you'll get. They have some of the best roller coasters I have ever been on. I have been here numerous times and I never get tired of it. Even though the cons outweigh the pros, it's still a great time.Pros: awesome roller coastersCons: everything else (lines, cleanliness, etc.)",Maps10451
40,Best Park Ever! Pros and Cons.,"Six Flags was the best amusement Park i've been to yet! We went on a tuesday, so there weren't many long lines. The park was very clean and tidy, the staff was awesome. The bad thing of the park were the roller coasters. Not that the roller coasters were bad, I love them. The queue lines for ""X"" and Superman were unbelievable. If you go I advise you to go on a work day. The ""X"" coaster had major problems. All day it broke down, then would start back up, then break down again. When I got there in the morning, the ""X"" had a 4-5 hour wait. But I finally decided that when it breaks down I'll get back in line. Waited 3 hours to ride it. I advise you to ride the roller coasters in a counter- clockwise path, starting at Flashback, then ending at the ""X"" or Revolution. The food wasn't horrific, but the eating places were. If anything, eat outside where the wind could self clean the tables. I can bet you on this that, if you go on a saturday, most of the rides, will have a 2 - 3 hour wait. Also Eat at the McDonalds across the street from the park, it's beneficial. If you go, HAVE FUN! It's Definately worth it.",FellowTraveler37701
30,mountain of fun,"Their not kidding when they say its a mountain! this is not a park for strollers and the handycapped. Be prepared for hills and stairs. As for rides its pretty good! We went in August and the lines were real short, I would still recommend a fast lanes pass, it tended to get busy later in the day. Food prices were rediculouse but its a theme park. No wimpy cartoons here, adults and kids you get to meet batman and other superheroes!",Passenger36868
20,dissapointing,"I have to say I was dissapointed this time. visited the theme park on saturday Aug.2,2003. We visit the park atleast 3 times a year but this was our first Saturday there. We arrived @4pm since the park is opened till midnight we figured we would be able to get on everything and wouldn't be affected by the heat. The problem that we had was in line waiting to get on a ride. Everywhere you look there are signs posted stating ""Places in line can't be held for you, and if you are caught jumping in line or holding a place in line that is automatic cause to be expelled from the park"". For example we were in a line that said 1hr wait time for this point, meanwhile teenagers with no common courtesy nor class were just walking throught the line on a damn cell phone holloring to their homies about how far back they was and where they at in line so they can meet up. Needless to say our 1hr wait ending up being 2 hrs.Why have the signs if there are no park attendants to check? It was like that all over the park. See what happens when you make the price affordable for everyone. Maybe thats why Disneyland never has deals.",FrequentFlier4108
40,Screamin deal is right,"Screamin deals was right. Coke and 6 Flags did it right. An empty can of Coke Product saved me $90 on the entrance fee. Which was really a suprise. Althought I was set off at the price at first, I read the information on the internet site and was rewarded with the Screamin Deal offer. 6 Flags was a nice place, clean and seems like all the people who worked there were very nice, from the clean-up crew to the manager I met who asked me if things were ok, and what could be done to improve the park. Over all the park was fun for the family, although the weather which the park has no control over was a little humid it was fine. Would advise those who head that way to get there early and enjoy, cause it fills up quickly and then some of the rides can get a little bit long in the wait to ride times. Food is a little more expensive. Water fountains are sort of hard to locate. Rides are not for the weak of heart. Screammmmmm is right.",Travel30242
10,Macho Security,"My daughters have been going to 6-flags on a regular basis since they were 12. The last 3 years with season passes. They are 16 and 18 now. Today they were to meet a group of friends there and decided to invite 2 boys that live in our neighborhood to come along. When my daughters and these boys got there, the boys were immediately singled out and told they would have to pass the park's tests before entering the park. The boys agreed and the officer who was taking care of them at the time was pretty cool about it. Everything was fine until the guard named""Anthony"" showed up. He was totally out of line. He insulted them and harrassed them and said that they had to leave the park. At this point the guards put them on video. Once the camera was on, ""anthony"" no longer made any insulting statements and refrained from getting too physical with the boys. This is very upsetting because my daughters have gone to this park for years and never encountered this kind of situation. They were embarrassed for their friends. My daughters had to find the rest of the group and let them know what had happened and that they were going to leave too because they were no longer comfortable there. The guard ""anthony"" said that for today they could not go in the park but they could come back on another day. So what was the problem? These boys are not gang related, they are not druggies, they have no tattoos, no piercings, no bandanas and were wearing what most teen boys wear. Yet this macho ""anthony"" took it upon himself to pressure them. Granted, it was not ""anthony"" alone who did this. There was one other man( a very huge man) who assisted him. What I also found curious was that the video camera only went on after ""anthony"" and his buddy did their dirty work. I know that many people have had problems with security at magic. What I would like to know is why today was not a good day for the boys, but another day will be okay? Does it depend on the security guard and what kind of day he is having? Obviously, these boys were okay or they would not have been told to come on another day. My suggestion to anyone who goes to this park in future, have your video cameras rolling before you even get in the park. that way if anything happens you can get everything down, not just what security wants you to see. I do not want to mention my daughters names because they are thinking of going back for one more try. I would rather get a refund on their season passes and send them to Disneyland instead. But I don't like the idea of them being singled out now because of my comments. The irony is that some of the group that was meeting today worked on the 4th of July, so they were all going to get together today at Magic to celebrate ""Independence Day"" I sincerely hope that ""anthony"" and his buddy receive tenfold what they dish out. I also hope that Magic takes a good look at their security in California. Your ""security"" garden needs trimming and you have two ""weeds"" that need to be pulled.",Navigator36674
50,To the Xtreme,"First time to MM in over twenty years. Have to say it was a great trip. The park was clean, just avoid the restrooms near the major attactions and main gate. Park is mostly for the teenagers with the Xtreme rides. There is also a small place for the children. Good day outting. Best time was when the rollercoaster broke down that I was ridding.Had to stay in it for 15minutes, but done something that very few people have done, walk down a flight of stairs. They gave us something for our troubles. Free front of the line to any coaster in the park, except for X or Scream, along with the coaster that broke down. They also have a line pass called the, Fast Lane. You buy four tickets for $15. You then go to those rides with the Fast Lane, go through the exit, and board. Beats waiting in a line for 45 minutes to an hour and a half. Highly recommend MM.",AOchoa95
