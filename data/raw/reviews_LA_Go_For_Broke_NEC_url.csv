40,"Tucked away, but worth seeking out","It's a shame that this monument is somewhat out of the way, and difficult to find. There are no signs pointing in its direction from the Japanese American National Museum, even though this would make sense, particularly as the content of the Museum is so relevant and even spends time explaining the significance of the Go For Broke motto and men.It is both a monument to the men of the 42nd Regimental Combat Team, and a place to learn about the men, their values and their exploits. An important message for all.I was not aware of the interpretive centre until I returned home. Again, there was not enough signage for out-of-town visitors to get the most out of this site.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MeredithAussie
50,Learn About The Most Courageous US Military Unit Ever!,"This is the smaller cousin of the Japanese American National Museum that is just steps away across a small plaza-like space. It's located in the Little Tokyo section of downtown Los Angeles. It is dedicated to the men and women who bravely served in the armed services in WW2. Their stories of bravery remain untold to the majority of Americans over the years. There are a number of interaction units, display cases and poster boards very tastefully done to inform the public about this untold story.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ohgeorge
