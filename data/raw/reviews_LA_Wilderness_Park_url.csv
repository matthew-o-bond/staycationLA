50,"Great park close to Arcadia, California","Wow! I just got back from a visit to Wilderness Park in Arcadia. The park is superbly maintained and very clean. Tent camping is available with a reservation ( through the city). Wildlife is present ( including snakes an possibly bears), but we didn't see any. We did have a huge female deer come really close to us, and the boys were excited. A lottery system runs the nearby hiking trail system. The ranger was a nice person and drove by several times to make sure we were ok. Entrance gates are locked at times, so I would recommend checking the web site toy see about visiting this ruggedly beautiful location. Would I go again, without a doubt yes!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GaryI428
40,Beautiful park nestled against the mountains,"This is a beautiful, out-of-the-way location -- visited here many times for Scouting activities, but it has picnic areas and trails to explore.The road in is a bit narrow, but worth the trek to the top of Arcadia!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chuckm521
50,"Easy hike! Good for kids, especially Cub Scouts!","I took my Cub Scout Den on a hike up this trail to the waterfall. It is only about one mile up and back from the upper parking lot ( near the nature center) to the waterfall. Even in the drought there is water. The trail is well maintained, but there are a few places where caution is advised. Lots of families on the trail. Good for a day hike. Not ADA accessible to the falls. This includes strollers. Take only pictures, leave only footprints. No fires, only you can prevent forest ( or wilderness area) fires!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GaryI428
40,Good place to take the kids,"Just be aware that it is closed on weekends unless you RSVP, so it's best to take the kids on a school holiday or half-day. They have a half-mile hiking trail, picnic tables, a ranger's station with stuffed animals and exhibits, etc. If you are lucky, you can see some deer come down the mountain. You may even see a snake crossing the trail.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaryMargaretMcMertz
40,Gorgeous Wilderness,We took our grandchildren to Wilderness Park on the weekend. Be advised that it's important for you to make a reservation before hand by calling the phone number listed. It is a beautiful place for walks and hikes that it so wild but so close to home. There is a lovely nature center with examples of wild life in cases. We had packed drawing paper for the boys and they loved sitting quietly and drawing with pencil. When we returned home they added color to their sketches. What a great place to enjoy nature.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DonnaandGene
40,"""Very Good"" for small children and First Time Campers","Not deep enough into the wild for me but an excellent choice to get First Time Campers acclimated.Camping is reserved for Groups Only but is also open for day visitors. The small 1/4 mile hike is surprisingly nice, as the terrain does change on this short easy hike. Including a very brief steep section. Traihead starts behind the museum (keep to the Left) and winds around behind the campgrounds and ends by the creek. The creek is over your left shoulder as you enter the parking lot. So having some water to explore is a plus for kids. Includes a meadow for group camping and a good sized cement amphitheater seating section around a large campfire area that could easily accommodate 100 people.There are a lot of picnic tables, Grills and they are building another restroom too.The small museum was surprisingly informative and full with a variety of stuffed animals.We saw a variety of snakes, including a Gopher Snake and 2 Rattle Snakes and most cool, was the BEAR that paid us a visit well before sundown. So be sure everyone knows the basic rules for encountering snakes and bears and keeping ALL food, candy, soaps, lotions, etc out of and far from the tents. They live there, we we just visiting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bentheredunthat
40,Great place for a hike,"We live close by and try to get the kids out into nature as often as possible, This place is perfect for us, safe hiking on well prepared trails that are great for a high energy 4yr old.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SteveL403
30,Great place to camp or picnic but facilities are minimal and primitive,"The whole place can be hiked in 45 minutes and seems land-locked. But serene. I was in town on business and wanted to get a little sample of theSan Gabriel Mountain/foothills. This park was the best I could do. I walked for an hour through city streets to get there. The place was almost empty and there were zero campers. The city website says, ""Have you ever wanted a local place where you can relax and unwind after a stressful week?...."" However, the sign at the entrance says closed after 7:00p.m. week days and not open on weekends, hmm isn't that when most families and others use facilities like this?? The wilderness center has a variety of stuffed animals representative of the fauna from the area. The displays are interesting but in poor repair with description pieces falling off and bugs decaying other parts. There was a brochure rack that was completely empty. There might be waterfalls to see, at least that is what the local barista reports? There was no one there to ask.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/minnesotasparky
