50,Outstanding,"My daughter had seen a photograph of a ceramic watercolour paint palette, expensive to buy but top of her 'Bucket List'. I contacted the owner of Mud Shack to find out if it would be possible to make one. Denyese could not have been more helpful offering help and advice to improve on the design.As a result on my daughters 21st Birthday two weeks later there were squeals of pleasure, a very happy young lady.A week later my wife returned with family and friends to participate in a scarf printing evening, Clare too had a great time and is really pleased with her scarf.The studio is warm and welcoming, the products and samples laid out on the shelves are brightly coloured and a joy to look at. Very friendly staff and an obviously popular venue.",Falmike
