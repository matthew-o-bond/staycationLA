50,Docent Led Bailey House Tour,"I went for the first time last Sunday and it was very informative and interesting. The Bailey House was occupied by Whittier's first settlers in 1887. The house is tiny, but the Whittier Historical Society has done a wonderful job staging it with historical furniture and artifacts. I learned a lot about Whittier that I'd never heard before, even though I grew up in Whittier.The Bailey House is open FREE to the public on Sundays from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. The House is closed on rainy days. Tours are led by volunteer docents, who do a great job. Go to the website before you go, to make sure the house is open for tours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/retiredjanfan
