30,Open air street market in downtown LA,"This is the LA version of open markets that you see around the world in Morocco, Instanbul, Mexico, etc...vendors packed in one next to another selling their goods of all different types. Much of it is clothing but there is almost every type of item sold. Don't go looking for name brand items though - lots of knockoffs and lower priced versions of different goods. We went on a weekday in the late morning and the market (about 3 blocks long) was packed full of people. If you don't like crowds then it may be uncomfortable. The main language spoken appears to be spanish but people were kind and friendly, but I would be aware of my surrounding. An interesting place to visit but not for the purchase of name brand goods. It is in the 'fashion district' but does not have much in the terms of fabrics and goods to make your own garments. I'm glad we went once, but unlikely to come back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/charliespal2
30,Suitcase,"I've been going to Alley since the late 80s never seem to have problems,but the last time it was bad.Bought a suitcase from a vender paid $40 seem strong but when I went to transfer my items to that suitcase handle broke,I went back (same day,60min later ) he didnt want me to give me a refund ,he showed me a sign which was hidden NO Refund or Exchange wow but got an exchange that should cost me $20 Beware",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Awamoi
50,Great place to shop,"If you go just thinking the worst you will be fine, people scared me telling me was no safe to go with a baby!!! But we had a good time, we found what we were looking for and all good!!! Service was great! U are able to find from sport clothes to wedding dresses!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joparolo
40,Repetative,"Hundreds of shops and market stalls selling same (of mostly cheap) tatt. Can barter cost with most of them. Nothing ""high end"" lots of fake stuff. An experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Metoyoutometoyou
40,SHOPPING SHOPPING SHOPPING!!!!,"Had a great time shopping in the garment district. You need a least a week to walk the whole district. I enjoyed EVERY second,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KimelaM
50,Great gift & souveneir spot,Make sure you wear comfy shoes and clothes. There is allt of walking. Went with my 1yr old and 5 yr old. TAKE A PRAM. Visited from NZ so it was a definate experience. They do have everything. Highlights for me are the ball gowns and perfume stores. Bought t-shirts for souveneirs for only 4bux each and still good quality. Plan to spend the day there and you can find some cool things.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lolasewa2913
10,Avoid at all costs if you’re a rourist,"This is a great place for prom and wedding dresses. Plenty of bongs, super tight jeans, and overpriced ugly T-shirt’s. Nothing for tourists here. Spent $18 to park just to walk around in a circle for one hour and buy nothing. Sports jerseys were low quality and I would’ve been fine with that if they would’ve had more options than just Mexico, Honduras, Spanish teams, and English teams. I have never looked more forward to visiting a place to be so disappointed. Even my three teenagers didn’t want to buy anything here and that says A LOT!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lindarplusfour
10,Brutal Fashion Shopping,"I love shopping, and love fashion, so was excited to explore the fashion district in LA and Santee Street. What a brutal disappointment! Sketchy places with many homeless. Dirty, garbage everywhere, and clothing stores garbage. Just a complete waste of my time. Skip this one!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Live4Strength
50,They have it all...,"First off get there early it gets crazy. If you do t like crowds definitely go during the week. Open from 9am to 5pm they have tons of stuff. We bought my daughter's prom dress and would never buy one from another place. They have food vendors(hotdogs wrapped in bacon...yummm) churro's, corn and tacos all the food we had was great. Screen protector for my son's iPhone 10 bucks installed. They have clothes, makeup, jewelry, shoes. Parking is more on the weekends (7 -15.00) 3.00 and up on the week days. We enjoyed it so much we went back the next day. Just know it's busy....you CAN barter...and some places charge 1.00 the use the restroom(they are cleaner and worth it)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JulieBandSteveB
30,Know What You Are Doing,"We were born and raised in New York and moved to LA in the 1980's and have traveled a lot so we are skilled at visiting and shopping in different kinds of atmosphere situations and neighborhoods. My wife knows several establishments here and when we have occasion to travel to LA after we moved out to Arizona we make a visit to this area. We have had friends who did not feel very safe when they visited one time and never returned. We find no reason not to return. But, we suggest you not bring attention to yourself with expensive clothing or wearing very visible expensive jewels. Pay parking is available and if you have a handicap card the meter parking is free. Meters take quarters or credit cards. They are hard to find. Restrooms are hard to locate.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RichardS778
10,Not worth the time,"Santee Alley is and open air flea market that stretches over a few blocks. Most of the stuff I saw looked like low quality items, be it clothes, accessories, electronics etc. I can see how it may be interesting fun if you are a kid, or if you are looking for cheap shopping for a costume party. If you are not in one if those two categories there are way better places to go shopping for ""unique"" things.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cassilis666
30,Different type of experience.,"For one, please be informed that the shops close by 5.30 pm,nearer to 5 pm. Do not expect too much. It is not an air- conditioned mall,but streets & streets of small shops offering dresses,dress materials, luggages, hand bags, accessories etc. Shop keepers are generally friendly.Most places accept cash only.Quite crowded.you can go once,as for shopping , it is not worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Xenajay
40,Have low expectations and you'll have a great experience,"I used to make my mom drive me out to the Garment District in LA when I was a teenager so I could find different clothes that none of my friends were wearing. Fast forward about 30 years, and I found myself back in the area for an evening of fun with my husband. We took a walk over to The Santee Alley for some food and a little shopping with ZERO expectations. I didn't go thinking I would find anything. Frankly, I already know that everything here is some sort of knock-off of some other brand. The folks that run the booths here are earning a hustle.After we ate lunch at Baby Lobster (overpriced and cash only), we took a walk down the alley. My son had told me he needed a few things for his upcoming Halloween costume and low and behold, I stumbled on it mere moments after stepping into the alley! They had bandanas and wigs and hats and purses and wallets and cheap bluetooth speakers and fruit cups with chimoy and horchata and all the things that make a good swap meet or flea market. I also saw lots of fancy dresses for quince girls.It's totally overwhelming, but if you put yourself in the right place, you'll have a good time.I'd totally come back if I were in the neighborhood again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/321christab
10,No worth it at all..don't waste your time,"We ride 1 hour to LA to visit The Santee Alley and definitly it's no worth it. Dirty streets full of horrible clothes, aparells, very bad quality electronics and make ups, ...The feeling was just as visiting a bad version of any Chinese market.I can't understand how some people's reviews can say this is a lovely place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adelvalle76
40,"Exciting, affordable finds here","Just remember that Santee Alley is no air-conditioned mall and this is not the shopping place of the perfumed set. But if you are willing to brave the crowd, then you may be rewarded with some exciting finds. Here you get low-priced fashion accessories from sun glasses (knock offs) to costume jewelries, hand bags, scarves and footwear. There are also clothes and surprise! They are usually trendy.There was a time that haggling was the norm but that is a thing of the past. But you might want to give it a shot and get the item you desire at a lower price. If you are budget-conscious, then this is a great place to buy gifts for family and friends.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Icb2003
50,Simply loved it,"I love a good bargain and yes you can find them here! You have to really look for what you want, but the ambience and the shops were really relaxed and nice. Felt a bit like being in Mexico or another Latin American country, as most vendors were Hispanic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/65yantingy
30,Keep Going; Nothing to See Here Folks,"The Fashion District is huge with Santee Alley supposedly being the heart of it all. There are lots of off street parking ranging from $5 to $12 depending on location and size of your vehicle. The parking attendants can be aggressive for your business; just try your best not to run over there toes as you drive by…. Santee Alley was like walking through a Swap Meet, the advantage here is that the vendors have a larger inventory of size and selections. Most stores are willing to haggle; not a problem if they don’t accept your offer, just go to the next store. My wife bought some shoes that was priced at $35 and was able to get them for $20. All in all, it was a cool experience if you have a couple of hours to kill. Otherwise, skip it and check out other cool places in Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joel1316
10,Antithesis of Rodeo Drive,"This is an interesting experience, just not as I had imagined. Yes, it’s called the heart of the fashion district in LA, but there’s no fashion here. Yes, lots and lots of inexpensive clothes in shop after shop of open air selling booths, all looking like an advertisement for the synthetics industry. Probably some finds here, like prom or special party dresses for young girls, but it’s somewhat seedy rather dirty and on a Saturday, very crowded. Did not feel the inclination to try on anything or even walk into any of the shops. It is, however, something unexpected as a US shopping experience, but intriguing despite. Parking a nightmare, with hawkers eager to draw you into their hairpin lots, which is OK, but questionable safety-wise. Was disappointed because was looking for fashion finds. Nonetheless, it was interesting, just not as advertised.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PlatinumHoney
50,Santee Alley fun,"If you are in downtown LA and want a fun shopping experience come down to Santee Alley. It's near the fashion district. There are so many treasures you can find. Most things do not have pricetag so be willing to do some shopping and haggle prices. Some shops owned by the same people are in several locations. So you might not see your size they will call the other locations and have things brought over to you. The whole area is filled with garments,accessories, and all kinds of knick knacks. It's a mixture of different cultures vendors selling their wares. One word of warning in any touristy area. Always be aware of your surroundings and keep your wallet or purse close and secured. Its right areas and can be prone to pick pockets. Always better safe than sorry. As you drive around the areas you will see people waving flags they are directing you to parking locations that are not always so obvious. Be prepared to walk a lot and stay hydrated. Lot of vendors also sell waters and drinks. There are also tons of fabric stores in the same area. Hope you have a fun trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RichardVegas
20,Poor quality goods,"Went here with my two daughters looking for bargains. Overall I thought it was not worth our time. The merchandise was not good quality at all, parking was difficult and we had to fight traffic to get there. If I had it to do over again I would skip it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lynn_from_WI
50,Great for Formal Dresses,My daughters and I make a trip to Santee Alley in the LA Shopping District every time they need a formal dress. There are many stores and great prices compared to retail.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kkufa
20,Busy busy place,"We made a visit to the Santee Alley this afternoon and it was pretty chaotic. Parking was a mess due to the traffic of both people and vehicles. It was extremely crowded in this shopping area. In terms of what is offered, most of the shops sell pretty much the same type of things. It was definitely a blown up swap meat environment. What I did like were all the vendors selling delicious fruit cups, churros and hot dogs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chickabeegrrl
10,“Fashion-Smashion”,What a joke- there’s better crap in canal street in NYC. The stuff is all knock-offs and cheap flea market crap. Based on the reviews I was expecting more...also- very seedy. Don’t bother!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jmac0126
50,Lots to see and shop,"This place is bustling with activity. Had a chance to sample and buy a couple of locally made items. Loved the items on sale, especially freshly churned macadamia butter. I regret not buying more.The food options here a good and affordable too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HRH-Siva
50,Shopping paradiso if you have the coin to do so...,"Was on the last few days of our holiday and was told to make sure we come to Santee Alley, unfortunately we were on our last 2 hundy and had to do budget styles. This was the wrong place to try budget because there were soooo many gems i wanted to buy lol so be sure you have kilo's free and coin to buy goodies from here. We stopped for a cool drink and hotdog...sorry the name escapes me but it was a mango flavoured drink and its was yummmmaaayyyy. Santee Alley is a must!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mafeenah
30,Experience the real LA,"if you are a female and want to shop for the newest fashion, this is the place to go! a bit hectic and chaotic but fun to experience it. just be careful with your purse and make sure you have a street hot dog!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cristinacF1402EG
20,Pretty disappointing,"I was curious to visit Santee Alley and finally got there yesterday. I was thinking it was a venue for up and coming designers to sell their unique things. It is nothing like that. Yes, it is flea market style but that did not bother me. What bothered me was that everything being sold was JUNK as in crap that the vendors bought in bulk from China or wherever. Like anyone else,I like to get a bargain, however, the stuff being sold is very poor quality and there is nothing unique about any of the items being sold.It is stuff you could get in a dime store. That being said, if you needed pieces for a Halloween costume you would find luck here. Their are lots of wig stores and gaudy accessories which would be great for a costume party. There is a building blocks from the entrance of Santee Alley on Olympic that sells apparel and accessories to wholesalers only but is open to all on the last Friday of the month. Look it up and if you happen to be visiting then, this place would be worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O4806MQmeganr
30,Prom dress search,"Came to Santee Alley (garment district) to find my daughter a dress for her prom. There are a LOT of dress stores in the area so be ready to spend some time walking/driving around. Found a dress for her as well as her sandals for a third of what I paid for my other daughters dress years earlier. Lots of street parking but prices do change according to the time of day so if you're planning an all day shopping trip it might be best to park in those all day parking. Be careful as prices can be horrendous! ($5 for the first 3 minutes!) so make sure what you're paying for. Bathrooms are scare and not the cleanest on top of paying the $1 for each use so be aware. Other than that, bargains galore! I believe you can even ""haggle"" on some prices too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johntB2771CM
40,All about your perception,Santee Alley isn't like shopping on Rodeo Drive but if you temper your expectations you just might find a good bargain or two.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/itsthetravelguy
30,Not for us.,"We made the trip down here to hopefully do some bargain shopping. There is certainly things here very cheap however not really what we were after. For anyone after cheap makeup, hats and shoes its probably great. We did buy a few hats that were 3 for $10.If you are going to head down here stay within the shopping area. We ventured about a block away to get some food and it got very sketchy very quickly.As I said it wasnt for us but there is certainly a lot of things for sale down here - just depends what you are looking for.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TraceyB788
40,Shopping at a discount,"We went here to shop some locals said it was a fun day to explore the garment district. They have pretty much everything there shoes, clothes, perfume, makeup, gowns and a lot of knock offs Gucci,Prata you name it.Glad we went to see it and buy a few things.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DentalMom320
30,Just junk,Santee Alley was once a paradise of garment industry samples and seconds. Now it is a place where inferior garbage from china is sold for prices higher than amazon.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DragonLady90292
50,A hidden gem,"This alley is FILLED with merchandise with lots of varieties to shop from ,tons of accessories, clothing, makeup, shoes, knock offs and much much more!!!I was so excited there, definitely a different shopping experience... i saw lots of the merchandise that i see in wish app or amazon.The alley is crowded but we didn't have any problems or troubles , and i bought some fun stuff and accessories from there.It definitely worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HD76HD76
40,Bargains aplenty and great drinks!,"Bring cash and be prepared to bargain with numerous vendors. Easily found parking at reasonable rates in garage very close-by. From cell phone cases to toys to Dodgers shirts to designer clothes and shoes, you can easily get lost here. Very crowded on weekends. Our favorite were agua fresca fruit drinks from Alley Dog. They sell large cups of watermelon, strawberry, mango, pineapple, horchata, and so many more refreshing fresh fruit drinks for $5 each. They have actual fruit in them, not just flavoring. These were so good we went back again later on our trip! They have several spots in the alley and also sell beautiful fresh fruit cups. These are worth the stop alone. Fun way to kill an hour or two and grab some souvenirs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DonnaD741
30,Same ole same ole,This really isn't the Garment district but more like stores that you would see in Tijuana. There are about six or seven stores that are repeated throughout selling the same thing over and over again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danielmT7958TD
50,Miniature Tijuana in a good way!,"Santee is a little bit of everything. Hispanic culture, great deals on fabrics, shoes, bags, clothing and the like. It's next to the flower district so you can get great deals on center pieces, table cloths and the likes. It's a party planners dream and then some. It can be hit and miss but the experience is worth it. It's also surrounded by the fashion district.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/susanweisinger
40,Must do,If you like shopping and picking up a bargain this is your place. Great for gifts if you want to take back souvenirs etc. make up is all over the alley and very good prices. Shoes handbags watches etc reminded me of shopping in Thailand. kids and family enjoyed it. You could do a few hours or a whole day. If you do a whole day do your research plan it out the area of fashion district is huge but the alley alone you could see in half the time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Abbyfryer
50,Fun Day!!,"We had time to kill before going to a Dodger game, so I looked online & came across Santee Alley! Awesome deals, people were very nice. of course its a flea market, so it was dirty in parts, but whatever! Parking felt a lil shady, but it was fine...Overall... if you like to shop & stroll- that's your place to go! I enjoyed it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/554kerric

Especially we found some traditional Indian ( Asian) finger rings for really good rates comparing to gift shops- jewelry shops in other places like Santa Monica- Las Vegas etc.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hospitality-Ajay
50,A must for shoppers,"You can find almost anything at this outdoor swap meet stuff for cell phones ,clothes, weddings dresses, suits,stereo speakers,lingerie,dress shoes, tennis shoes and lots of awsome street truck food and fruit cups and ice cream. They have a fashion district a floral District",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/989renem
50,DIFFERENT TYPE OF MARKET,Love the Mexican hot dog.A shop run by two asian women where we chose the designs and she printed it was amazing. thank you so much because our families in Australia love it. There are perfume stores and they are not bad for the price you pay-they even allow you to hagle lol this is a great market place and shouldn't ever lose the authenticity of it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/214pepef
30,Warning before you go...,"They only accept cash. With that being said, BEWARE of your transactions with vendors. If your purchase requires them to give you change, they may pretend they don't owe you any change. In my situation, I had bought some 8 dollars worth of snack and food and gave the female vendor a 20 dollar bill. After handing out my snacks to my family, I waited patiently for the lady to give me my change. I noticed she was busy so I politely asked if I can please have my change. She gave me this look like, ""what change?"" She hesitated, but eventually reached down her fanny pack and gave me the change. We ate the snacks within the proximity of the vendor, and it wasn't surprising that minutes later, she got into an argument with a woman about getting their change back. You know that guilty/liar look? Yea it was plastered all over the vendor's face but she still refused to give the change back. The tourist eventually walked away pissed and frustrated. I hope this was an isolated incident from an isolated vendor. Please be aware.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChueyChang

50,Fun Shopping Environment,"Very energetic area to shop. I love coming here to find the best pricing on Colognes and Perfumes, as well as haggling with the vendors. It's bordering the famed LA Fashion District where you can buy the best fabrics, notions and attire. My travel partner spends atleast a full day going store to store. Check out KK Distributors for Perfume - my favourite place in the Alley. Always be prepared to haggle to get the best pricing. I avoid weekends, and always go mid-week (early AM start) to ensure I avoid the crowds and get the best deals!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/432donaldc

50,International Bazaar Here at Home Amazing Deals with Cash,"Every time I am in Los Angeles I have a blast going here. The fabrics are amazing, craft stores, leather goods and the like are fun to seek and purchase. Haggling is often part of the culture. It's like going to a swap meet or Tijuana shopping area or?? Some booths are there for years and others come and go. Not upscale items but you can always find something you don't necessarily need. Great prices on Swarovski jewelry. You just image that if you bought this at dept store you would pay 10X more often for the same items.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/susanweisinger

30,Cheap shopping,"It's like traveling to a foreign country and going to their tourist flea market area. Santee Alley is just a small part of the Fashion District. Calling it the Fashion District makes it sound like an upscale part of Downtown LA but it's in a not so great part of downtown and you definitely don't want to walk around the area alone. The shops have a lot of the same items for cheap. They will also bargain with you. I was hoping to find some knockoff versions of super expensive purses but apparently the guy only shows up once in a while carrying the knockoffs to sell. If you are looking for cheap souvenirs or items, this is the place to go. Parking is between $5 to $10 bucks depending on where you park. You can also try to get meter parking. Make sure to have cash on hand (dollar bills) in case you need to use the restroom because it costs $1 per person to use the bathroom.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelingParent1

Santee Alley is your one stop shop for the dress, shoes, jewelry, and other accessories. Make sure you start very early in the day and wear comfortable shoes. There's a lot of walking. Take cash, you don't want to run your card at all of these little places, plus they usually give you a deal if you have cash.

On a side note, there were even pinata's down another street LOL It was my first try on the hot dog loaded with everything which was actually pretty good. Wear comfortable or good footwear.

I do regret not stopping at one of the hispanic food trucks nearby - oh the wonderful smells!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BethChicago
30,THERE'S WOMEN'S APPAREL & ACCESSORIES GALORE!,"This place is loaded with Women and children's clothing and accessories, toys, men's shoes, women's stripper-type stilettos & fake jewelry, etc. The prices are usually non-negotiable (""I gotta make a living, too"").This place is huge and hot in the summer heat of Los Angeles near Olympic and Pico Blvd. It's very popular with the Latino communities and their young ones. Bring an umbrella for shade and maybe a folding chair, too, to rest your tired, swollen feet!There is no place to sit and rest in The Alley, except a restaurant/bar where you must purchase something to eat and/or drink. You can listen to music and use the toilet there also.My favorites are very cold beer, fresh-cut cold fruit in a cup, and street food.The Santee Alley vendors close at 6:00pm, but sometimes the clubs feature live music in the evenings.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ldianap2014
40,Lots of bargains and a fun day,"You will get a lot of bargains from new 3 piece suits to clothes and electronics toys ,purses for the ladies and go hungry there is so many food trucks and they are so tasty lots of tacos and hotdogs . You will have a great time and a good way to spend 2-3 hours",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/989renem
40,Outdoor Flea Market with Bargains,"My daughter and I went to Santee Alley to do a little shopping. The place was huge with vendor after vendor! There were tons of clothing places, but not really any named brand items. There were a lot of stalls selling high end make-up such as Mac for dirt cheap. I'm sure they were knock offs, but it was still fun buying the stuff at such a bargain.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dylan98
40,Well that was fun!,"We had heard about the fashion district and just wanted to check it out. We accidentally got started in the fabric district (costume designers dream) and then went over to the Wholesale only section (whoops, don't go there) and finally made it to Santee Alley. It was a lot of stuff!!! Some is the same but some is not. We found some gear for the Dodger's game, beach wear and crazily enough, a prom gown for next year. If you like browsing to look for your own ""treasures"" and have a few hours to kill, this is a great place to go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/awallacenevada
50,Love this place! !,This place is awesome! It is a few blocks of vendors and stores through the alley way and sides of the street.. they have all types of different things for sale $1 jewelery bundles of socks and t shirts.. and lots of cool little things.. a Great way to spend a lazy Sunday just walking around! The atmosphere is crazy..people every where willing to bargain and there mexican tacos and hot dogs are delicious!! If you go make sure to wear comfy shoes and don't agree to the first price you see..some other vendor more down probably has a better deal!! Happy shopping!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scillas2015
30,"Lots of the same stuff, disappointing.","Lots of imports, lots of the same things, cheap items, sort of like Harwin Street in Houston. It's called the Fashion District, however, I'd have rather been on Rodeo Drive! I would not go back here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rtmidland
50,Amazing shopping and deals:,"I love this place they have some of the greatest deals for the best price, search around befor you buy, because some of the venders have better deals than others. Some will allow you to nicker for and even lower price. Ask and if they say, ""No"". Dont be offerened, but what if they say, ""Yes"" then you will be glad you at least asked. They are merchants and they want to get rid of their product, because if they don't they will make no profit. Know you always a choices where one will say no some one will say yes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CharmellD
50,GO! if you love shopping,"What an amazing place! You can find all the latest trends in clothing and shoes! You can also bargain...Make sure you do, you can usually get a few bucks off. For the ladies and makeup lovers... they have all products, Mac, Smashbox, Naked Cosmetics etc...... and you can buy in bulk.Its alot of walking so make sure you wear comfortable shoes (Or just buy a pair like I did)......",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MzYYZ
40,worth it,after reading some of the reviews i was expecting great deals and a really sketchy vibe. I didn't really get too much of either. It's pretty safe. I brought my kids (ages 15-6) and felt totally comfortable. I did get ripped off on the parking. I found some ok deals but only on some tshirts and sunglasses. i'm not a brand snob so i wasn't interested in paying $25 for a $95 shirt. But it was fun. it reminded me of shopping in a mexican market with all the chaos and pushy vendors - which to me was fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/280joeb
40,"Lively and interesting - great prices, not-so-great service","The alley's atmosphere itself was very fun and full of energy, bustling, and very busy. There were a lot of fantastic deals too good to pass up, however you'll see a lot of the same exact things at many of the stalls for varying prices (I bought false lashes for 3 for $5 only to find the same ones later at a different stall for $1 each). Make sure to look around before buying - don't feel pressured to buy something when many of the other places offer the same thing for less. Also, many of the people working did not seem interested in giving a good customer service experience so much as making the sale in general. Some were very helpful and knowledgeable and polite, others were on their cellphones and were rude. Hit-and-miss really. Overall as an experience I would recommend going and picking up some things for cheap anyway, it's an interesting atmosphere and fun way to pass some time if you enjoy thrifty shopping.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mindyhhh
50,We had a blast,Went prom dress shopping. Got both dress and shoes at a very reasonable price (don't forget to bargain). Looks great! Fun day. We'll be back next time we are in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Whozyamama
50,Even if you are not a shopper come anyway,"This place has just about everything you need from household blankets, .rugs, apparel and fashion at very low or bargain prices. But even if you have no plans to shop and I highly doubt you'll not end up buying at least something, come visit and observe the true grassroots of how American dream begins. Every merchant is out to chase that dream. After visiting this place you will have some sense of how these merchants are all from different heritage all blending into one as Americans. Each American with a native tongue and . have English as a second language. It's pretty cool.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Indiana_Jonesse
20,Nothing like Canal Street,"We are regulars on Canal Street in NY because we love to buy knock off handbags and sunglasses for our kids, so Santee Alley was a big disappointment. We didn't see a single store that sold knock offs, and the store owners seem scared to even talk about it. Finally a street hawker walked by and asked if we wanted Chanel or Louis Vuitton, but we had to go up in a dark parking garage to see just a few choices. Felt more like buying drugs than shopping. All in all, the place is just a huge flea market. Not what we had hoped for.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hall160
50,bargin shopping over load!! must see!!,"Being from the east coast I'm not impressed by much.. We have some grat shopping until I came to shantee alley! Upon arrive in the fashion district we emcourted all the wholesalw spots, which are great if u are a seller! We got bumped grabbed a few tacos from a truck and figured we were n yeh wrong part! As we approached we encoutred many street vendorsmwith all your favorite cosmetics names unknk in love I got 3 lip gloss for 10 bucks!! We were on a role from then on no lie i spent 230 USD and got clothes good quality! Shoes !! Socks and all!! We did not even see it all! Will be going again just to shop! Deals galore!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/992nicolec
50,Love this place!,"Santee Alley is an ""experience."" There are all kinds of shops selling from soup to nuts. My husband and I were looking for luggage...at one shop we asked the price and it was $40...I asked if we get a break if we buy two ....$35.00......we picked out two and then I said, ""So was that $30 each?"" and he said ""Yes!"" So you have to barter in some shops....or stalls.....since there are ver few shops.Parking is the pits...and even though there are men waving flags to get you into their parking place with signs that say $3.00....it's $3.00 for the FIRST TEN MINUTES! The parking meters sell the spaces for $4.00 an hour and take credit cards. We drove around and around wasting time trying to find a decent space and finally decided on using one of the $4.00 an hour meters which was a block away from Santee Alley......Santee Alley is in the heart of the fashion district and there are many other stores and shops around with various goods.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/556shirleyr
40,Mad house shopping area,"This was my first visit to Santee Alley to do some photography there. It's a mad-house, wall-to-wall people (we were there on a Saturday) with lots of little shops and food vendors. A fun area to walk around and check out all the people and shops selling all kinds of (cheap?) merchandise. Lots of characters there, too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelsWithStephen
50,Great for Prom dress,Looking for our first Prom dress we thought we would give Santee Alley a try. Well actually Santee Street. There must have been over 50 dress stores all together. It was a fun Mother/daughter day out. Parking was easy in paid valet parking areas. Not nearly as scary as I had heard.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aussiegirl002
30,"Great people watching, not so great shopping","although I enjoyed the trip to Santee, probably won't be back. Lots of very inexpensive clothes but mostly very casual. The teens enjoyed the knock off fashions and costume jewelry and trendy inexpensive handbags but there wasn't much that interested me.People are super friendly, there was limited street parking and quite a few paid lots so parking wasn't too difficult but was probably hard the later in the day it got. The Tacos trucks were delish and there were interesting food choices. The people really run the gamut although being LA there the predominant group is Hispanic. Lots of families and young people out for shopping and fun. I enjoyed myself but due to the lack of items that interested me, wouldn't return unless I was bringing a friend or shopping for teens.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mykidssherpa
30,Crowded,"We went on a Sunday afternoonVery crowdedStuff for sale repetitive and lowish quality.As my son said, sort of like the Hong Kong markets but not nearly as interesting.Best part a few streets up - maple st - if you love fabrics- I have never seen so many fabric stores with such an amazing range in one place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/linbinpin
30,fun little cluster f,"This is basically a swap meet but not as great. There are clothing shops, make up stands, toy stands and electronic places that are literally all identical. It was really hard to find anything of really any style or necessity. I think DTLA is trying to make this place like super suave and selling it but it really is just a crowded moderately inexpensive street market. If you want anything mexican or cool but a little overpriced I would just head over to Olvera Street, or anywhere else. It's not terrible though to kill like 1-2 hours of some light shopping. The food trucks and fruit stands were probably the best part. :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kath1031
40,Feels Like Mexico,"Santee Alley is 3-4 blocks of clothing, electronics, food, toys, and fabulous people watching. you can walk its length in an hour or so, get a taco or six at one end and see all kinds of things for sale. Not an everyday experience, at least for me, but intriguing and fun. Culturally diverse folks on the street. Interesting photo opportunities, but be respectful...not everyone likes having their picture taken by strangers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CaFrancophile
50,A pleasant experience!,"For years I've been afraid to take the short 30 minute trip to scary downtown L.A. But what a surprise and delight!! My friend and I went 3 times in one week, shopping for 2 weddings and a luau. We not only found everything we needed from dresses to fabric for blankets and the bacon wrapped hot dogs... Oh my!!!We were treated with great kindness everywhere we went, especially Kimya at Mina's clothing store at 916 Santee St. She was a doll!! She even offered us cookies and went out of her way to talk and laugh with us, we were surely visit her again and again! We had great service from the owner at D&R Party Collection at 950 Santee St.If going on a weekend, go early, when they open is best, because it crowds up!! On the weekday was great but the freeway traffic was bad. Parking can be expensive, 3-10 dollars. But definitely try the hot dogs with the works!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KJC155
40,Good deals,"Went here some years ago. It's not very neat, just a typical market with stalls everywhere. Good deals on shoes clothes jewelry and phone acessories. (As someone mentioned alot is like what you get at forever 21 and Charlotte Russe etc).Worth the trip of you want to bargain hunt and eat cheap.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aisha147247
30,It's different--for sure!,"We went there on a Sunday to do some light shopping and basically to see what is Santee Alley.Parking hawkers are on the street waving you in to park--you will not have to fret about where to park as they are quite visible on most of the streets.You probably cannot try on the clothes as very few booths have a dressing room so come dressed with a camisole under your top if you want to try on a shirt or dress.After a spell, you will see the same items so do not hesitate to do a bit of bargaining. Some of the clothing my daughter purchased looked like stuff you can find at Forever 21.We left after two hours as the crowds got thick, it was hot and the novelty was gone.Look, this is not for everyone but if you are not fearful of new experiences visit the garment district just for a slice of life that is not available in your town.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lkmama
30,Enormous Flea Market,"We spent two full hours browsing the street from end to end. This reminded me of an enormous open air bazaar that you'd find in Mexico or the Dominican Republic. We weren't really in the market to buy anything, but it was fascinating to look.Almost everything is ridiculously inexpensive. I looked at about a dozen shoe stores, but every shoe was labeled ""Made in China"" so I didn't make a purchase. A friend bought two souvenir T-shirts for $3 each, which look nice. I wonder if they'll last through one wash cycle.A couple of shops sold men's 3-piece suits for $49 !The women's and little girls' clothing looked so interesting ... lots of colorful items caught my attention, and again it was all very inexpensive. I didn't find any shop that looked like it would have a dressing room I'd be comfortable changing clothes in though, so I didn't try anything on.Hip hop and Latin music booms from some of the shops, sometimes so loud that it repels customers who aren't deaf. Other shop owners try to persuade customers to come inside, which was a turn-off.The wonderful smell of hot dogs grilling permeates the air in a couple of places and it's almost impossible not to succumb to temptation. You can also pick up an ice cream bar or frozen fruit bar.This is worth the walk just to absorb the sights and sounds and smells of the Santee Alley.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FancyFree55
10,No thanks,"If you enjoy feeling like you're being stalked by pick-pocketers or not knowing what the actual sales price is for watches, sunglasses, yoga pants, hot dogs wrapped in bacon, suits, prom dresses or fake silk suits ... this is your place!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OhiOkie
30,open air bazaars,If you are looking for cheap clothing this is the place to come on the weekends. Getting here is easy via public transportation. The clothing runs the gamut from casual wear to business clothing. Feel free to bargain here. Make sure to have some cash on hand because some of the vendors are not able to take credit cards.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hoben01
50,BARGAIN HUNTERS DELIGHT.,"Before you shop anywhere else,come here first and bargain your [--] off.Quality is better than Thailand clothes and food stalls are every where. Best hot dogs in the U.S.A. We found a lot of great deals on Nike shoes,baseball jerseys and new era caps that were $20.Be aware that restrooms are charged at 25 cents above a roof car park.(don't ask me why)When you are done shopping and have to catch a cab,may work out better to walk to a main road away from the crowds and then ring a cab as it will be too difficult for the driver to find you.Spent $1000 for 4 kids and 4 adults and that was good quality clothes that we searched really hard for.Try to schedule a minimum of 2 days for shopping here.The 1st day to get use to it and the next days too shop hard. Good luck.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ryzi_13
40,This is a great spot.I can't believe there is no review,"Search LA Fashion District. This is one of the areas to get just about everything at cheap knock off prices. The Santee Alley is like a cheap person's bazaar. Surrounding streets are fun too. Costume jewelry, sun glasses, men and women clothing. The quality is average or below but the atmosphere is truly different. It is very safe area. Shops close at 6:00pm . Easy and cheap parking - $3 to $5",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tommy745

30,Reminded me of shopping in Asia.,"We had some fun shopping in Santee Alley in the Fashion District in Los Angeles. It reminded us a lot of shopping in Asia, where it is cheap cheap cheap, but the quality isn't great. There was also a lot of fake name brand stuff, and it was repetitive. Don't get me wrong, it was fun to wander and ogle at all the stalls, and I got a cool t for $2. Good for souvenir tshirts and hats.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fezzie1
40,Shop 'Til You Drop,"Love, love, love this place! We stop by every time we're in L.A. You can't beat the deals here. Try wandering off the alley, too. Some of the shops on the perimeter have even better deals. One downfall is that the restrooms are few and far between.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KniteRiter
50,Bargain! And the dirty dogs are a must!,"Its worth it, if you buy wholesale(quantity). If you buy 1 pair of jeans you'll pay 10. When if you buy 5 pairs you'll pay 5 dollars each! Hope this helps.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cindyperales
50,Its a hoot!,"In the alley you are not sure what country you are in, its a cross between Mexico and China. You can find all sorts of bargains and lots of stuff that you don't want but fun to look at.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marynaturelover
20,you're better off shopping at the mall.,"we went here because all the fuzz about all the great deals. parking is about $5. a lot of the places are for wholesale only. although there are shops where u can buy clothes, shoes etc. I was hoping to find good deals on clothes but I was dissapointed when I found a dress I had bought At the mall for more than I had paid.I also saw a dress I had seen at the mall for $5 more. basically tops are $15-20, dresses are around $30. shoes $30+ basically the same thing as going to forever 21 & Charlotte Russe etc. plus you'll avoid the overcrowdedness of this place & you'll be able to try the clothes on since this place is like a flea market with just a bunch of stands. I don't think I would come here again. Fyi the clothes for men/guys are so out of fashion.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gabyrocha0
40,"I'm not going to lie, I come here for the hot dogs with bacon!","You haven't fully experienced L.A. until you've had an L.A. dog. Forget Pink's, this is the best place for a hot dog. Several street vendors sell bacon wrapped hot dogs which are beyond delicious!! Get all the fixings which includes ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, grilled onions, pico de gallo, and avocado. They'll even throw in a grilled jalapeno on the side. For about $5 you can get a combo which includes chips and drinks. Ok so that is the best part of the alley. Other than that, there's cheap clothing, jewelry, and toys mostly. Beware of many knock off products such as Mac makeup. It's cheaply made and you get what you pay for. I come here mostly for the food but on occasion buy a pair of sunglasses.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carolinelomeli
30,You need to be 'brave' to get the most out of it,"2 -3 blocks of market style shopping from clothes, shoes, toys, luggage/bags etc. Mostly spanish speaking stall operators who are happy to negotiate. Offered copy handbags, LV, Coach etc buy needed to go to different building located upstairs - wasn't game enough to go an take a look whilst I would have liked to. We walked from Staples Centre and whilst we were on 'heightened alert' there were no issues. Very quiet on the street until we got to Santee Alley and then there were large numbers of people - can't say I heard any Australians! If you are brave and happy to explore the stores you will no doubt pick up some bargains. You can't just hail a taxi you need to call for one - just something to keep in mind",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/roko_me
30,Crowded yet cool,"I was amazed at the endless array of clothing items for sale, all of which seemed to be fairly reasonable. But, if you're looking for brand-names, theres not much here, most of it is of unknown brands with questionable quality. To me, this is a place to go for the experience, a bazaar in the middle of downtown Los Angeles!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DevonE303

20,Crowded swap meet,"I took my family to the Santee Alley to shop for my young teen girls back-to-school clothes.We walked away empty handed.

40,Crowded but great deals,"Guys out on the street flag you into parkades which was helpful. Alleys are like an open air outlet market. Tons of shoe stores and clothing stores interspersed with purse stores and some men's shops. Prices are crazy cheap and clothes are quite original which is a nice change from name brand tshirts that all have the same design. Shopping for grad, weddings, etc., this is THE place to come!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nevillcanada
30,Great to visit but BE CAREFUL with what you buy!!,"I just came back from my 3rd visit to Santee Alley, and as much as I L0VE visiting this place, I have to share the negative aspects, so I can help save the next person money. All three times, I have purchased DVDs, and all three times I have been completely let down. I have finally learned my lesson. The DVDs that are being sold on the streets in the Santee Alley are GARBAGE!!!!!! We just bought ""TED"" and were assured by the vendor that this movie was high quality. She lied. We played the movie and it froze halfway through, so now, in order to see the rest of it, we will have to go sit at a theater and re-watch the first 40 minutes. I should have known better, but I let my guard down, even after the first 6 movies (bought at past visits) were all junk. Now for my next complaint, I bought a small suitcase, cute as can be. After I took it back to my hotel, packed it with my belongings, and threw out my other suitcase, the handle broke on this brand new one. 0k, I only paid $20, but the handle that allows a person to pull their suitcase around, is pretty important!! My advice, visit Santee Alley, it is amazing!! D0 N0T buy anything that has any importance. You want ""fake"" perfume? Great place to get it!! Be careful with clothing also because we witnessed first hand a vendor crossing out a size to change the size to what we needed, with black marker. I am not kidding. But if you can try stuff on, they do have great deals on really cool clothes. Visit the place because it does make for a really great day!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/679chard
40,I would love to go back!,"Had a super time going from shop to shop, even my kids had a good time shopping around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alisia23
20,Not fun.,"I'd so hoped that the happy reviewers were right and that I'd find some great clothing buys at rock bottom prices. Unfortunately, the pessimists were more reflective of reality. To be fair, this is probably a good place to shop if you are a young budget shopper who can speak Spanish. If you are a mature woman, forget about finding anything that fits. It really is like a big Forever 21 with the same prices, and lots of cheap-quality made-in-China stuff. I bought only a cheap pair of sunglasses, because I forgot mine. My husband bought a cute fedora, which he's happy with. Even my teen daughter bought only a couple of things. The highlight of the entire experience was the bacon-wrapped hot dog and fresh watermelon chunks -- Delicious!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jusie
40,Great outdoor bazaar,"Lots of small shops selling knock off clothes, belts, handbags, fashion accessories, perfumes, food etc etc. Nice place to spend several hours browsing and buying also. Save lots of $'s in the process. Take your time, and odnt buy at the first place you see what you want; make sure you browse a bit first to see all options",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alikarim
50,I want to go back!,"Santee Alley is situated downtown within the larger LA Fashion District. The area is essentially an open air bazaar packed with small stores, vendors, merchandise and shoppers. There is a vibrant, multicultural flavour to the area and this is reflected in the merchandise. The clothing is a mix of wholesale, sample sale items and knock offs. Quality can vary but the prices cannot be beat. I bought a pair of name brand shoes for $29 (the same shoes were $45 in a shoe store in Santa Monica and $47 at that brand’s outlet store in Cabazon). In general, the styles appealed more to my teenagers than to me – but it was still a hoot to be there. It was a sensory overload and a fun and memorable shopping experience. Now that I have been there once, I will definitely go back when I return to LA. At the very least, this is the place to buy your tourist t-shirts, ball hats, sunglasses, etc.There are numerous parking lots in the area (check LA Fashion District on web for parking and washroom maps). There are also options for snacks and beverages. I recommend being cautious in this area – but do not let the somewhat gritty street scene scare you away. I cannot think of anything like this in North America.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NorthVan_dan
