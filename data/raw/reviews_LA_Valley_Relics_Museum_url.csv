50,Fun and unique collection of LA pop culture memorabilia! The neon alone is worth it!,"I thoroughly enjoyed my swing through the Valley Relics Museum last year when I was in LA. They have a wonderful collection of pop culture, restaurant and landmark memorabilia from LA (and specifically the San Fernando Valley) from the '50s through today. Their collection ranges from music venues items to pinball machines to western film mementos. Their love of the city and the business of the past is evident. The collect is organized well and a lot of fun to peruse. The neon sign collection alone is worth a visit. This great find is definitely worth the hour or 90 minutes you will want to look around. Highly recommend!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Texas_Traveler71
50,Like a stroll through your grandfather's attic,"Even though I did not grow up in the Valley I still enjoyed my visit to this museum which features lots of memorabilia from the 40s, 50s and 60s. A nice collection of neon signs and mementos from places like Dairy Queen bob's Big Boy. the collection is eclectic but there is something interesting in every nook and cranny.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/packedandready2go
50,Loved It!,"Having grown up in the San Fernando Valley, the Relics Museum brought to mind so many memories.The signs and displays are wonderful.You will not be disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelinAlan
50,A Great Look at the Past,"Even though the address is 7900 Balboa Blvd., the actual entrance is off of Stagg St., east of Balboa Blvd. Turn into the driveway and look for Buildings C & D. Open Thursday thru Sunday only, 11am to 4pm.Great place to find old stuff from the San Fernando Valley, Hollywood and the surrounding area. They will be rotating the exhibits in the near future so you can visit time after time and see new things on each visit. I became a member today. Pretty cool, if you ask me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobertL873
50,Memories galore,"Growing up in the San Fernando Valley, I was vary familiar with many of the artifacts. It's eclectic, it's fun and and well worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Banerman
30,There were Valley Relics in Attendance,"I understand that the Valley Relics Museum has recently relocated. It occupies two bays of a hangar-type building near Van Nuys Airport. The collection there, if you can call it that, is supremely eclectic. There were little model airplanes and photos. There were old cars and photos. There was lots of Western gear and photos. The highlight for us was probably talking to Roy Rogers;, Dale Evans', and Trigger's granddaughter. One bay was filled up with old neon signs--that sort of thing. Frankly, I thought the $10 admission charge was a little steep for what was there. On the other hand, I may just be out of synch with the clientele, many of whom were Valley Relics themselves.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RebelVirginia
50,Coolness does not depend on size,"If you grew up in the 1950'-70's, love the era or were just hanging out in the Valley, this spot is not to be missed. It's small, but I defy you to hold back from blurting out your favorite memories of Roy Rogers, The Rifleman, Pep Boys, Big Boy and a host of other Baby Boomer mainstays. Great restored neon signage. It's open for a donation on weekends (check the website for hours). Lots of fun tee shirts to be had.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mitchellc172
50,FANTASTIC FREE MUSEUM!!!,I’d been wanting to visit for quite some time and finally made it! It was fantastic! I loved seeing all the old signs from defunct valley restaurants!!! It’s magical!Two things they could do better: I wish there were more info cards out by the old signs to say what you’re looking at. I was super interested and wish there was more detail! They could also benefit with a few activities that kids could DO as opposed to just see.But still this place is amazing and free! With free parking!!! Check it out!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bostonsavatage
40,Cool Place To Visit,"I had purchased shirts from Valley Relics in the past and when I realized they also had a museum out in Chatsworth I knew I had to visit. Admission is free (although they accept donations and you really should toss them a few bucks.) Essentially this is a warehouse space that housed their collection of... well, relics from the Valley. Lots of neon signs, old merch from shops, photos, menus, even Bad News Bears memorabilia which was filmed nearby. Lots to look at. The owners were hanging around and were totally friendly and awesome to talk to. The collection is kind of a fish mash and it could use some cataloging and signs with info to let you know the significance of some items. I know they're working on that and I'm sure this place is just gonna get cooler and cooler. They're only open one day a week (Saturday) for a handful of hours. Definitely check it out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jointfilms
50,Old school Valley style,We were here for the big BMX bicycle racing reunion on Sunday. I didn't want to hype up the event too much to my friends in case it was a dud. The place was packed when we got there and all these great restored and junk BMX bikes brought back great memories. The late afternoon rain came and everyone had to pack up in the parking lot.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Creeping_Death_LA
50,A BIG FUN,Tommy - has the best displays & collection EVER! I have no idea how he collected all this fabulous STUFF!!!It's a must see! Things I never knew about the Valley ......................... what a feast for the eyes!!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YardSaleLdy
40,A Fun Look at Valley History,"One Saturday afternoon we were looking for something to do, and stumbled across a TripAdvisor review for the San Fernando Valley Relics Museum and decided to check it out. They have a lot of interesting memorabilia, photos, and artifacts related to San Fernando Valley history. My favorite thing was the original land grand for the San Fernando Valley which was signed by Abraham Lincoln. The museum suffers from a serious lack of signage about the displays. There are so many interesting things that are just tossed in a case or hung on the wall, with no description of what it is about. I was talking with one of the docents and he said that the owner was working on getting more descriptions up. I look forward to returning when they get the signs up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mom_of_Alex
40,San Fernando History & Kitsch,"Open every Saturday from 10-3, the Valley Relics museum offers a unique glimpse into the history of the San Fernando Valley. Growing up in SoCal, we hear over and over there's nothing historically significant here. It takes a place like Valley Relics to realize we have our very own history. From menus and booths from shuttered restaurants, to neon signs from businesses long gone, to scripts and memorabilia from local films, to postcards and souvenirs from our theme parks past and present, it's all here. Yearbooks and class pictures from some of the more historic high schools and much much more. The museum is free, but they do take donations. And an entire display of t-shirts with vintage logos are available for purchase.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/halobb
40,A Look Back at the History of the San Fernando Valley,"Hidden away in Chatsworth, CA is the Valley Relics Museum. It houses a collection of all kinds of things that had some significance in the history of the San Fernando Valley. It's a fun place to look around and see ""what was"" when many of us baby boomers were growing up. Open Saturdays from 10 to 4 (I think).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobertL873
40,San Fernando Valley History,"If the San Fernando Valley was a city on its own, it would be one of the largest cities in the United States, but as a part of Los Angeles, it's suffers from a loss of identity. There are several small museums and historical societies, but no central comprehensive museum. Valley Relics is trying to be this central museum. It is located in the community of Chatsworth at the northwest corner of the Valley.The museum is small and new and growing and may move to a larger building before the end of the year. This small building is packed with artifacts from neon signs and cars, to film scripts and postcards. We spent about an hour and intend to return once it moves to a larger facility.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KennethL828
