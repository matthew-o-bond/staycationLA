50,Exquisite,One of the magnificent aspects of this richly ornate theatre is the marvellous central staircase. Surrounded by further decorative features it is a testament to the era of its completion.This was in the early 1930s and it was one of the last great Broadway theatres as movie viewing attention was shifting to Hollywood Blvd.Today it is used as a film location and is available for special events.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/permia
50,Theatre is amazing BUT advertise the actual start time,"Went to see Jose Gonzalez play at the LA Theatre last night and the night started off poorly with the show start time advertised as 7PM actually being 9PM. I’m down with any time, just say the right time so the audience doesn’t have to sprint to the show and hang out for 2 hours. The theatre is incredible, sound in amazing so not a bad place to hang, and maybe it’s a ploy to sell more booze. Maybe bad promotion. In any case, be wary of the start time. DTLA has changed ALOT since I was last there 30 years ago. It’s no longer a blade runner scene after dark. Folks walking around having a good time, cool places to see amazing. Wish I knew when the show was starting, we could have spent more time looking around the DTLA area. Jose was good as usual. Could have done with less orchestra and more guitar but hey, it’s all good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cojosurfer50
50,Gorgeous Movie Palace,"I went here last night to see “The Birds” from Alfred Hitchcock (great movie and director) presented by the Last Remaining Seats and the theatre is extremely beautiful! So much attention to detail and reminded me of when I visited the Palace of Versailles! The main auditorium could use a little TLC, but it was still stunning to see. There’s also no AC so it can get a little hot but I pretty much always have that expectation in mind when entering buildings that are this old (built in 1931). An amazing place to host an event! They just don’t build them like this anymore!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/colbys2014
