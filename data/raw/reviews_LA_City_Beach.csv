40,Why this is Long Beach,Long Beach got its name for the long stretch of beach according to the stories told on our harbor boat ride.,KenFromIllinois
40,A wonderful day,My wife and I walked on the beach and saw a number of kites flying. What a pretty day! We will go again some time in the future.,Bill Curran
30,Not one of the nicer GLAA beaches,"Compared to many other beaches of the Greater Los Angeles Area (GLAA), this beach is smaller, and the beach sand is not as nice.",KodoDrummer
20,Dirty Beach with lots of garbage,"After recently visiting clearwater beach in Florida, this beach was a complete disappointment. The sand and shoreline was littered with various garbage and some homeless people were hanging around the bathroom area. The only nice things were is that early in the morning there was free street parking and a nice paved pathway for runners/walkers and bicycles. All the beaches were extremely crowded and littered with garbage. Many oil rigs scattered the coastline. So sad for the marine life.",Sam2007$
50,Best beach because parking is so close,"I totally recommend choosing this beach if you have younger kids and need to make lots of trips to your car. Also, the sand is very fine, and the beach is very clean & safe (lifeguard stations everywhere). Getting in & out of the parking lot was stress-free, too.",Kelly M
30,Nice beach....love the boardwalk,My son and I ran a 15K race on the boardwalk of Long Beach. Nice boardwalk for walking and biking. 2 separate trails for bikes and walkers keep them separate and safe. Our run was in the morning and very nice weather.Beach seems to have a lot of breakers out there and could not see the horizon line very good due to them. Lots of large cargo ship traffic. Bathrooms along the beach were not very clean early in morning. Overall nice beach for strolling....not great for the view of the ocean.,James L
40,Long sandy beach with lots to do,"Nursing an injury, we did not get to enjoy walking along the shore; however, there is a great walking/running/biking path to use back from the shore and also a boardwalk at the street level. We did enjoy sittng in the sun and breeze, and watching the kites. It will be great to come back here.The man made islands for the oil industry are rather distracting and lessen the waves that find their way to the beach. But it was nice to see the docks, cruise ships, and The Queen Mary.",Pat B
40,A city beach with a lot of sand,"A very big beach jsut close to the city. There are no waves in the water, thats good if you have kids with you. The water was ok. Parking area close to the beach. Not so many people wednesday 4 pm.",Karin S
50,"big beach, lots of space","i like this beach, you can fly a kite, watch the tri athletes, or just enjoy the large expanse of sand",Douglas William M
10,Filthy and unsafe,"I grew up in Cali and used to frequent Long Beach as a child. When we took our family vacation back to southern Cali, we decided to go to Long Beach and play on the beach. WHAT A DISAPOINTMENT!!! The beach was filled with trash, there was so much plastic floating in and under the water. My 9 yr old son found a used syringe and picked it up. Fortunately the safety cap was used so he didn't get stuck. Add the trash to the oily looking soil from the obvious leaks from the islands the oil ships pump to. I spent my time picking up trash instead of enjoying the ocean. I'll never return to Long Beach and highly recommend everyone stays away.",Ron C
20,Oil rigs ruining the coastline!,"What was probably once a very impressive coastline, has over time become off colour and dated. It's astounding that these cranes and rigs were ever approved to be set up off the shoreline. The potential for renovation on beach front properties in parts as well as additional restaurants or attractions would go a long way to Improving it's current situation.",Grant S
10,Filthy,Took the family there on our vacation. What a filthy beach. So much plastic on the beach and in the water. On the way out my 9 yr old found and picked up a used syringe in the sand. I’ll never return and I won’t be recommending this beach. What boggled my mind was everyone there just walked past the plastic. I ended up with a bucket full of trash and I didn’t even make a dent in where we were sitting.,Ron C
40,Beautiful Beach,"The beach is lovely with sparkly sand. The bathrooms however were not very nice and do not have proper stalls, just toilets with walls about 3 feet high in between each one but no doors. Other than that it is a lovely beach with bike trails!",Yudi
50,"Great beach for a morning run, walk or bike!","This wide sandy beach certainly puts the Long in Long Beach! It seems to go on forever south of the Marina, with a separate paved bike path and a paved run/walk path. Running along early in the morning before business meetings, I passed older women walking with canes, young professional couples running, older men walking briskly, and a few scruffy types ambling along, all of whom seemed buoyed, as I was, by the bright sun on a clean beach. I felt safe and happy running along, impressed by the painted life guard stations and tiled restrooms, and the spaciousness of the beach.",EuroCarolyn
30,It needs more care,"The City Beach in Long Beach was the first attraction I saw after my arrival to California as I urgently needed walk and fresh air after a long travel from Europe. We walked from its entrance at Shoreline Drive and walked up to Dog's Beach and back. I enjoyed walking in sand, mild breeze and fresh air, but overall I was disappointed. Some of toilets were dirty and absolutely disgusting, we found a few piles of junk. And the biggest letdown was the Belmont Veterans Memorial Pier. So dirty and neglected! I couldn't believe this is to honor American veterans.Nevertheless I was able to relax enough and take a few nice pictures. I hope next time I am in LA I find this place in a better condition.",EvaF2Eva
50,Ocean View,"What can be said about the beach ... beautiful and amazing!!!The city beach with its newly renovated facelift offers so many options to relax, work out, take a walk along the path or just lay there and reflect on life.There is a jogging path, a walking path, a bike path, and numerous places of grass to sit and enjoy the view.The beach has barriers so it limits the waves as well as wildlife that will enter and pose a threat. The sand is often sifted so it remains soft and beautiful.Lifeguard stations offer some measure of security as well as a pretty well lit environment.Obviously the water is a little colder than usual but that sill doesn’t stop locals and tourists from taking a dip in its waters.Sunrise and sunset are always amazing to see from here as well as watching the ships come in and out of the two major ports that border each other.The Queen Mary and multiple carnival cruise ships are in direct view and offer great talking points even with local residents.Technically the beach closes at 10 but you will see constant traffic throughout the night as locals are jogging, taking romantic walks or just passing time in the beach.",Antonio
40,A nice beach,This is a good beach to watch sunset. The beach is not too crowded . There is a Dog area also on beach. There is path for bikers on the beach. Its clean beach as most of the stretch what we walked and saw.,Mansi_Vij
50,Enjoying a wonderful stroll,"Walking along the beach or on Ocean Blvd is lovely. Yesterday I have seen more people on the Beach and in the Ocean than ever before! Some were playing Volleyball, some were skateboarding, some relaxing. It was an awesome, peaceful sight!",dythomson
40,GREAT bike paths!,"Of all the beachfront bicycle paths in Southern California, this one is my absolute favorite! The paths are wide, well maintained and seemingly endless. It is possible to ride from The Aquarium all th sway to the end of the Belmont peninsula - and beyond with only minimal riding on public streets.",Jonaleen A
50,Paddling in the Pacific,What a beautiful beach to stroll along in the sun dipping your toes in the Pacific Ocean. Lovely and clean and miles long. Great place to spend the day sunbathing.,David G
10,It's a no go,"Terrible beach, dirty dirty sand - there were, besides the bottles and cigarettes, mattress and pilows on the sand. A very dirty water. Never again.",Pit P
30,I wouldn't swim here,The water in the location is blackish in color. This is not the type of water I would want to swim in or even stick my finger in to see what the temperature was. The restaurants around this location are average at best and I feel that there are better beach side locations 15-20 minutes away.,tonyraye1
30,Not so inviting,"Undoubtedly it offers the possibility of a dip in the Pacific, but as a beach experience compared to ex. Manhattan beach is not enough.Far from equally well-kept, unfortunately you meet what the ocean is spooling on the beach.Here's your own picnic that applies if you want something to eat",Phayao13
40,Less crowded beach in LA,"It was one of the beautiful beaches must admit for the reasons that it was less crowded quite clean and no food stalls around the region ...... they have joggers/cycle path on the beach which enjoyed with a bicycle ride ...... though if they took care of the negatives it would be certainly one of the best beach in LA ..... negatives were debris observed floating on the corner of the beach front, toilets were not clean at all ...... keeping food stalls away from this beach is certainly a thumbs up for me",Kaptaan
40,Port Beach,It's not the most beautiful beach in the world... But having grown up here one just loves to walk along the beach here..,ixtlan06
40,Views make it great,"Yes, you are not on a Caribbean beach, but the views here are awesome. It's not a sugar sand type of beach but for California it is a nice place with plenty of action. We weren't bothered by the homeless at all when we were here. Cool place to relax!",FamilyDad2013
10,Mrs,Not a very clean beach. Lots of trash washed ashore. The bathroom and changing rooms were gross. No vendors or food trucks for snacks just a ice cream truck.,Tricia M
30,Better from a distance,I enjoyed walking along the beach much better from a distance (sidewalk) rather than up close. It's very littered and looks nice from farther away. There's plenty of parkland to use for enjoyment along the Long Beach waterfront workout worrying about stepping on needles in the sand.,"Double ""Ollie"" Winner"
50,Best City in LA County!,"Come see ... Come love it!From the convention center, to the aquarium ... shoreline and the pier ... Bixby Knolls to 2nd Street ... Pine Ave to all the parks ...Long Beach is the new LA ... without all the hassle!",Antonio
50,Went in the summer to see large parts of the beach with very few people.,Large clean sandy beaches with a great walkway for strolling with a separate lane for biking and surrey rentals,devnprt1
10,Positively vile,"We have been to beaches all over the world and can honestly say that this one was without a doubt the most disgusting excuse for a beach we've seen. There was rubbish everywhere being washed up on the shore. The sand had this muddy appearance and looked like murky swamp water. Many of the people were trashy, too. There were kids - whose parents were not watching them - throwing mud at each other and I was hit in the crossfire. We left after ten minutes.",Fietsen1
20,Lots of trash all over the beach,"I spent my last day in USA at Long Beach and I was rather disappointed. The walk from the marina to the beach was nice, but the beach itself was very dirty. There were lots of trash bins around, but unfortunately it looks like none of the trash made it into the bins. The water is flat, so good for kids, but I didn't swim. There are so many better beaches than this. The train from downtown took a long time.",Rinee B
50,Fun in the sun,"Walk, run, bike or roller blade on wonderful trails. Restrooms and water available all along the way. Great to sit and relax and watch harbor activity. People watching is entertaining as well. Lifeguards on duty - safe and family friendly beach. Gentle waves great for small children.",rebelrose59
20,Completely disappointed,"Nothing but flat sand and murky shoreline water. I wouldn't dare put my feet in it, much less swim. The oil islands were visible from the beach. Does have a decent paved walking and biking path. The beach was trashy but there was a tractor scraping the sand all around, maybe covering it up? Spoke with a lifeguard who was terribly unfriendly. Seemed to be the norm for Long Beach. The public bathroom here was at least clean. Parking is hard to get here.",Amy C
10,oil-soaked. Absolutely disgusting,The water lapping the black oil-soaked sand was grey. The sand stank of oil. It is a disgrace and absolutely disgusting. I cannot get over how revolting it was.,emmachisett
50,FANTASTIC OPTION DAY OR NIGHT,"Plop down on your beach chair during the day and enjoy the surf and sun. Sunset offers some spectacular views of the harbour, Queen Mary or the hills of Rancho Palos Verdes. Or just relax at night taking in the twinkling colour lights out on the oil facilities or ships that are coming and going. Extra bonus is the free wi-fi from the Park authorities. It doesn't get any better than that!",SenorGancho
40,Nice Beach for a Nice Day,"This is a very nice beach especially if you want to do wind surfing. No real waves due to the breakwater, but the water is fine and the beach is super clean as the city maintains it well. Never too crowded. If you want larger waves, just head a few miles over to Seal Beach.",PatrickLongBeach
50,Beautiful beach!,A pretty long beach that is so beautiful. Seems like people hang out here in the evenings. A lot of them were sitting in the cars enjoying the sunset. The beach is within walking distance from Shoreline Village and the Waterfront. Perfect for a long walk.,Aralia A
50,Lovely,"Very nice beach for Long Beach. Keep in mind, it's not Maui. Many biking trails and walking trails. It's the ocean, so how can one go wrong with that?",Daphne D
40,Crystal Clear,"It's free,In downtown Long Beach, but not too many people there, which makes me love it more.And i know it's not the best, but a very good one. can park one the streets for free.",Shuo L
40,"West coast beach, great for runners and walkers","Beautiful beach for joggers and walkers and bike riders, public bathrooms available, in March no lifeguards but stations are spaced across the beach.",Mitchell B
30,Beach Fun,Nice place for family with kids. The water is somewhat dirty and waves are small. Homeless people seem to be a little problem and the restrooms were awful no soap or toilet paper,Tonya R
50,"Great views, clean sand, new restrooms!","The breakwater keeps the surf minimal so it's safe for families, there are regular life guard stations all along the beach, decent affordable parking and you can see Catalina, the Queen Mary, the container ships coming in and out, Long Beach Harbor and so much more. Enjoy!",thizizliz
20,Dirty and no waves,"They keep the sand clean, but the water is dirty and there are no waves. Find another beach to go into the water.",DougTMesa
20,It has trash,A lot of homeless people & trash everywhere - several people out today but the restrooms were awful & no soap or paper towelsLes7h,Les7h
30,Not very clean,I wasn't really impressed with this beach due to all the trash that was everywhere. It would be nice if more people knew what trash cans were used for. Still a nice place for a walk or bike ride but I doubt I'd swim in the water.,davidson168
50,Beach Watch,"My first beach on a ocean in 49 years. I so enjoyed my time visiting. I love to people watch, and this is the place!",JoJoKoKoMo55
10,Disgusting,"I thought all beaches were created equal in CA because on my trip to San Diego, we went to 4 different beaches and they were all gorgeous. Long Beach showed me my mistake. This beach had trash absolutely everywhere. People would literally jsut leave their entire picnic trash on the beach. I'm a big believer in if you pack it in, pack it right back out with you. But some trashcans that weren't already overflowing would have been nice. The bathrooms were beyond disgusting. I saw people almost walk in, took one look and sniff and turn right around. I was never brave enough to go near. We decided to walk to the waterfront mall near by. As we got closer to this things got a little bit nicer. The bike and walking path on the beach was nice. The waterfront mall area was very rundown looking. But they did have some great ice cream and the Yard House was delicious and had their wonderfully priced happy hour. But, no water side seating. All in all, I will never come back to long beach. But it was uplifting that they have community events there; we saw a giant orchestra band begin playing in the park nearby. Now if only they'd clean it up more.",RIOINIDIA
30,Good for walking/biking,"We visited the beach so we could put our feet in the Pacific Ocean. We found the water very cold. We enjoyed picking up a few seashells but not seeing the trash everywhere. There were many people enjoying the walking and biking path. The stairs we walked down to the beach were very steep; we were glad we found a ramp to go back up. The foot wash was very far from the path, so it was pretty ineffective.",Noteworthymom
30,"Great place to walk, picnic and enjoy being at the beach","The beach is not known for its waves. It does have a nice beach area with a separate bike path and walking path. There is parking at beach level. It's a nice place to relax and enjoy a picnic. On Ocean Blvd. you can park and enjoy a grassy area. It has a sidewalk that follows the coast line. Locals use the area, especially during the summer to hang out and enjoy the day. The Long Beach Museum of Art is only a few steps from the beach and it too is worth checking out. There are buses on Ocean to take you downtown and to Belmont Shore area.The is fishing off the pier but I wouldn't eat anything from these waters. I've been walking the area for 25 years and it is always an enjoyable time. It is safe to walk at night, especially during the summer.",J S
20,Got out to take a look but kept driving,I think what would scare off most people is the amount of homeless people around the parking areas. It didn't seem like a very nice place to take the family. I would pass for sure.,Pixtonian
20,Kind of a let down,The beach was very trashy. Lots of bums and I'm pretty sure I watched a drug deal. The Pier had lots of fisherman and great views of the cruiseships. Kind of run down. Sad because it has potential.,Maria M
40,Great location but could be cleaner!,"The beach is really easy to find. The sand is a nice colour and the water lovely and blue. There's some trash on the beach which lets itself down. A great place to stay all day. Parasol hire is available and is probably advisable on baking hot days. If you're down by Disney, this is a fun place to visit to wind down.",Paul R
20,Good for sunsets,This beach is good for sunsets but that's about all. Trashy and not conducive to swimming. A lot of runners who frequent the beach.,Houston N
40,Enjoy the sunset,"Before visiting this beach I read the reviews but decided to give it a try, and I am glad I did, because I did not have any regrets! We had a peaceful quiet time before sunset. I did not noticed any trash or wild, crazy people. This area was full of families. I felt pretty safe all the time with my kids!",Jptravelswithfreedom
10,Take it from a local...,"I run along this beach nearly everyday. Do yourself a favor and go farther North or South for an ideal beach experience.Although sunrises and sunsets are beautiful and the walking path/promenade provides a lovely stroll during the day - the beach itself and the water are not what you want for lasting memories. In fact, You're more likely come away with a lasting skin rash. As for the beach, you can't take 5 steps without finding a variety of trash. It's very sad really.Before the construction of the breakwater, Long Beach was called the ""Waikiki of So-Cal"" - there were WAVES! Since the breakwater was created the beach has deteriorated drastically. Add to that the pollution from the oil drilling islands, regular inland run-off trash from the nearby LA River (it empties into the harbor) and your general everyday muck associated with a busy international port. Forget about eating any fish you may catch within the harbor.Moreover, when the sun goes down the freaks come out. The shoreline is not the safest place to wander at night or during early hours of the morning. Amongst all the trash strewn all over the beach is evidence of the illicit things that take place there on a nightly basis. Women should not walk or jog alone without precautions. Shootings, stabbings and muggings are all well documented.That's my local beach in a nutshell. Enjoy!",el_Timerino
40,great beach but i have ideas to make it even better,"i wanted to go to the beach this sunday and thought ""not long beach because of the bad reviews'' but i didn't have time to go to Huntington beach, so i thought ''fine, why not'' I was so happy i decided to go to city beach(by the Belmont pier and pool is my favorite spot) the beach and water had no trash. I DONT KNO WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT CITY BEACH BEING DIRTY BECAUSE IT WAS CLEAN WHERE I VISITED! there are a lot of things to do there including swimming(either at the pool or in the ocean), biking, skating, running, and playing in the sand. I cant wait until the outdoor pool overlooking the beach and ocean opens! i also like how the drilling rigs look like resort communities. although i chose more than 3 hours in the recommended time, you can stay as little or as long as you want.Now onto my ideas to improve city beach.i would like it if long beach sunk the breakwater and brought back the waves.my other idea is to widen the Belmont pier and rebuild the Cyclone Racer roller coaster that closed in 1969If you live in or near long beach or planning a vacation to California, I recommend checking out city beach.",Adrian M
10,Sad but there is alot of trash on this beach,"We went a couple of years ago and noted that it wasn't the cleanest of beaches but this year there was so much trash it looked like someone strewn trash up and down the beach. Literally. Mostly plastic. So sad. I believe in this area the ocean is blocked off past the oil rigs, maybe that contributes to it being dirty? True it's not as crowded but that is why. Don't go here, go to Seal Beach or another area beach.",lovelyjamilew
50,Definitely will go again,"We have rented bikes and rode a long the beach for an hour. It was a joy that I advice anyone to do. I didn't have time to swim, however beach looked clean all the way the the water.",Gauwas
10,"Too Much Trash, Just Keep Driving","Do not go to this beach! Driving through Long Beach for the first time, I assumed all we had to do was drive to the ocean, and we could find a beach. This was true, but we found was the grossest beach I've ever been to. Should have turned back right then, but we were in the area and figured why not. Just walking through the sand to get to the shore was work. I had to pick each step to avoid trash, including various forms of plastic trash, and more obscene items. The closer to the water we got it did not improve. Where there is usually a line of seaweed from the last high tide, was instead a line of bottle caps, condoms, broken plastic and glass. I don't even want to think of what we would have encountered had we entered the water.However, not all Long Beach beaches are this disgusting. If you continue down Ocean Drive, just five minutes or so, past the Belmont Pier (not a rides and games pier, but just a pier for a landmark) the beach gets much nicer. Belmont Shore Beach, including a stretch with a dog beach (Rosie's Dog Beach) and volleyball courts is the best. It starts near 39th Place (as the cross street to Ocean Drive) and ends near 54th Place, where Penisula Beach starts, which is also quite nice. There was no trash to be seen, and the water was quite nice. I was there in June, and was surprised at how warm the water was.But do not stop too early, this beach is NOT worth the risk!",Michelle R
40,Great Beach,"Nice beach area, not so crowded, there was always parking available. Great view without all the crowds. Love it, we will return!",Renee505
10,dirty water,well the beach was pretty dirty when i went with no shortage of sea weed and you have to keep putting coins into a meter for parking. There is nowhere to get change for the meters. Me with my amazing luck got a ticket for 49 dollars that i have to pay in 21 days. My recommendation is go to a beach were you pay a flat rate for parking.,luis d
50,As Beaches Go...,"This is a nice beach. Well kept, well attended. We had a great time. The day wasn't perfect and it IS close to LA, but it was a great time!Dolphins were out swimming close enough to touch without going out too far. That was fun.As with most big cities, I don't trust the public facilities, but there was nothing alarming about them so the rating stays excellent. You may find it not to your liking, but caveat emptor on public health issues.",nabenom
50,Can't beat the Long Beach beaches,"Even the oil rigs look pretty good, since they are developed on little islands. Great sand on these beaches. They are kept clean and people are good about not trashing them. Whether on the ocean or the bay, if you like beaches, you will like these.",namsmom
30,Even my hotel concierge said to go to Huntington Beach instead,"Even my concierge suggested that I skip the City Beach and go to Huntington Beach instead if I wanted to swim. Af first I thought, 'What a lousy representative of Long Beach he is.' I ignored him and walked over to City Beach. Even though there was lots going on -- the bike path, the local swimming pool, a dog off-leash area (see sidewalk markings photo), and plenty of volleyball courts, there were no waves and the beach wasn't very clean. Next time I'll listen to the concierge.",movieglue

If you're looking for a place to surf or to play in... Huntington Beach is just south of LB (after you pass Seal and Sunset Beach). Shoreline Village is a nice place to walk and so is Belmont Shore. Belmont Shore is a street that you can walk that has a lot of restaurants, stores and is dog friendly (just make sure your dog is either leashed or can fit in your purse) Back to the beach part... it's a great place to run/jog as well.
