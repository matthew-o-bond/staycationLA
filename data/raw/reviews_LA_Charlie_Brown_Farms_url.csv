10,"Long time customer, no longer a customer.","On 10/04/2019 I called CBF to replace some items that were stolen from my house. I have shopped at CBF for decades. There were a few specific sentimental things that I wanted to re-purchase. I called and was put on hold for over 14 min. JUST TO TALK TO A PERSON! I was place on hold BY A SNOTTY RUDE VERY ANNOYED AND YOUNG SOUNDING GIRL who was irritated I called and asked for help. AND that was Just to begin this saga. I had 5 different employees place me on hold over and over, lie about or refuse to give a name to me, tell me who the manager was or tell me who the owner was for another total of 15 min. No one would tell me who the actual General Manager was either. 4 of them told me They were the ""manager"". The one that hung up on me twice claimed her name was marilyn, which was a lie. At this point I just wanted to tell the manager about my horrible experiences and see if they could actually help me. The last lady yelled at me, yes, literally yelled at me because I wanted to now the owners name and who was the real GM. She also told me that my ""call and sale"" were not ""important"". I was hung up on a total of 3 times. I called back 4 days later on 10/8/19 to try and get some truthful information from some different staff and speak to the owner, so ge knew how his customers were being treated. A woman named Judy claimed to be the GM, if that was her real name, wouldnt even let me tell her what happened. I simply said her staff was rude. She said, very dismissively, ""oh I'll have a talk with them."" She wouldnt even let me talk and tell her what happened. Everytime I said, ""yes but this happened too"", she said,""Ok I'll tell them not to do that too."" And I would try to tell her the next horrible thing and she just talked over me a half dozen times. She didnt want to hear the UNCALLED for and rude way they all treated me. The call on 10/8 With this GM WAS as rude and dismissive, AS HER STAFF. It's clear to me what the real staffing problem is, Judy! Just like HER None of the staff, would even listen to a customer! If you are thinking about stopping you probably should just keep driving..... it's a shame my kids grew up going there.... it's a bigger shame the owner is loosing business from poor staffing.",Sad former customer 2019

50,AWESOME,Very unique and interesting place! Allow plenty of time for seeing everything and taking in the experience!,Ginas418
40,A Fun Stop,"A fun place to spend your money. Lots of unique items. We bought a few things, but mostly just looked.",Don C
30,Crazy place,There is SO much crazy stuff in this place! Great stop for souvenirs. Odd town. Plenty to look at with an option for everyone.,Snakewrangler
30,Souvenir overload,"Oh my gosh! This place is packed with souvenirs, food, and people! It's hard to get around it because the aisles are skinny. Some people thrive on this. I hate to say it but it was not my cup of tea. However, we did go back first AM with no crowd and purchased olives.",mom4jnd
50,"Great, different place","Charlie Brown Farms is always a fun place to go to. They have tons and tons of really cool stuff you can't find elsewhere. Lots of it retro from toys to food and everything in-between. They also have like 100 flavors for shakes!!! I usually go on weekends but took my aunt, for her first time, on a Thursday and it was soooooo nice. Hardly anyone was there!!! It was great! Check it out if you are going through Littlerock, Ca in the high Desert. You'll love it!!!!",RLHINCA
50,A true Variety Store,"I arrived at Charlie Brown Farms with no expectations, just my friend telling me I'd be able to find plenty of dried fruits and chocolate candies, and I left totally blown away by the variety in this store. Alligator meat? Check! Same for frog legs, alligator sausage and more. Our family agreed this would be Christmas stockings only when it comes to gift giving, and for my son (47) and son-in-law's mother (late 60's) I found choices galore, including a mustache comb/razor, snake venom soap (!), Elvis flip book & many more unique stocking finds that were perfect. For me? The desired fudge, truffles and dried fruit. The variety truly is overwhelming ... a suit of armor, ceramic shark head, a ""California Santa"" statue. I could go on & on about how delightful it is to wander through this store. It was a busy Saturday, but having my purchases handled and getting out the door and jostling around other customers wasn't a problem. I'd return in a heartbeat!",Judijon
50,A fun place to stop,"Been stopping here for years for snacks, shakes (super yum!!) And gifts. They have so much to see! Funky, ecclectic, fun! Today we went specifically for lunch. Buffalo burger was awesome! Angus burger was outstanding. Both simple and flavorful! Just enough lettuce, tomato and thousand island to enhance, not mask the meat. The garlic fries were outrageous!!! Another family was raving about the BBQ too!! That will be on our list for next trip!!",Nanigirl275
10,"Stopped for food, left hungry","In the gift shop there is a lot of trashy items, cheap junk. But some items were disturbing, and when I asked about the racist material the manager tried to tell us it was just black history. There were signs white and colored drinking fountains there were black face dolls making fun of President Obama and other black leaders and a welcome KKK sign.I did not rate this location under restaurants, as I did not eat there after this encounter, and do not know about the food or service.A friend of mine told me they removed all this stuff last week, but I will not go near the place to see.I guess mexicans and negroes are allowed now, I do not know about dogs...see photo provided.",Charles M
50,Love it,Nice cute place to stop and get some snacks go to the bathroom very nostalgic. This place is very huge for the many variety of things.,Sdsunluvit
40,They Sell Everything,"What a unique place to visit. The store is made up of several buildings that sell everything from coffee to Suits of Armour! You can take a trip down memory lane as you wander through the store where there are candies from eons back and various toys, gifts and memorabilia from the 50's, 60's, etc to present day. There is an eating area for fries, burgers, etc and they are very famous for their milkshakes.Do stop in if you are in the area as it is a unique and fun place to visit.",Scotcanuck

50,Trip down memory lane,there is a such a wide variety of things at Charlie Brown farms I don't know where to start. they have a wide variety of fruit and nuts . they have a fudge counter . My GF was amazed at the inexpensive fresh produce. they have a ton of old collectibles . If you are heading to the Devils Punch bowl or coming down from Wrightwood or in the Palmdale area its worth a trip to check out the variety of stuff there,Mark T
50,Great Route 66 wonder,This place is huge you can spend hours wandering looking at all kinds of unique and kitschy products. They also have a great BBQ with some unique items. This is a great place to find gag gifts and exotic foods. Fun outdoor space with facades of the old west.,JKPImageFusion
30,skip the over-priced merchandise,"Buy some fudge, get a shake if you have time to wait for it to be made but skip the tourist trap merchandise that is mostly made in China. I was looking for authentic Native American crafts and after searching all over this very large complex, I did not find it. Very interesting browsing, though. Floors uneven so watch your step. They keep adding more and more rooms and transitioning from one to another is not for people with balance issues.",Lauralyn K
40,Crowded But Super Fun,"Love this little crowded place. I visited here on a Saturday afternoon. Though it was not packed with customers, it was more difficult to navigate due to the tight aisles. I would venture to say that many areas are not ADA compliant.There is ‚Äústuff‚Äù everywhere! But neat stuff! The food menu will take a good several minutes just to take in (can view it online also). There is a variety of honey sold, a variety of dried fruit (guava, cantaloupe, tamarind, etc.), theme nicknacks, gags, hot sauce, jewelry, clothing, gift items, etc.Food items include vegan, deep fried items, milkshakes, smoothies, BBQ, etc., etc., etc. There are also pony rides available in the front.We were in a hurry to get home, however, the next time I am in the area, I would definitely plan a trip to spend more time here.",VegasBling
40,Interesting stop on the road!,"While looking for a geocache we happened to be at Charlie Brown Farms and had ro check it out. Lots of fun stuff to look at, didn't have time to check out the outside, but it looked like fun. Had the chocolate covered strawberries , and I must say they were mighty good.",Patricia M
30,Poor Treatment of Long Time Customer,"I have been shopping there for 13 years, buying honey, dried fruits and nuts etc. I have to say I was very offended when the owner stopped me from walking out the door the other day and demanded to look in my recyclable shopping bag. They have a policy of not using plastic bags and charge you for paper, so I bring my own bag...The only thing in it was the newspaper I had just bought outside and my car keys. I had gone in to check out their strawberries which they have a big sign for. The strawberries were not any good, so I did not buy any. I have been a good customer for many years, I even used to sell my photo cards there...Yet she treated me like a common shoplifter! Wow. Not very nice customer service and she is the owner! What a way to set a good example of customer service to her employees! I have always enjoyed shopping there before this and if they didn't have such a good price on bulk honey and nice people working for them I would consider never spending my money there again!",jillkelly777
50,Hours go by in this place !!!! Great time !,"We were at this store for about 3 hours, not counting the time we spent eating. Great place to get old things, traditional candy, original soda pops and much more. Awesome food and smoothies.recommend this place to everyone !",VeronicaTrias
40,You could spend a couple hours here,"So many items to view, a lot of unique items, lots of joke food items and weird flavor items. It is a lot of fun looking at all the items, and you can also grab a meal at the deli! Well worth a stop.",Ranbud
40,A trip down memory lane,"Old fashioned candies, cartoon icons, fresh produce & local honey, ice cream, great burgers and beef brisket.. Collectables from every genre, fun outdoor statuary. Returned 2 days in a row since we were not able to see everything the first day. Fun place for all ages. Everyone was friendly and helpful despite being very busy.",Sharon O
50,This Place Has Everything,"Friends took us out to ""the farm"" while we were in town visiting from Washington State.
