50,I loved this place,"Lots of vendors selling comics, toys, sports, wrestling, anime, pins, posters, shirts, Pokémon Star Wars transformers terminator dragonball etc etc",Getsemani gonzalez
50,Came in for vacation,This place was recommended to me and it was more than I expected. I was looking for a particular rare Star Wars collectible and I was able to find it here!,andrewcamacho
40,Something for everyone.,Loaded with 100's of separate vendors selling anything from Baseball cards to Japanese anime. They have magic tournaments. Autograph signings and collectible supplies.,Paul Y
40,Indoor shopping open two days a week,"Two things you need to keep in mind whenever you're visiting: a) they're only open two days a week, and only one of those days is a weekend, so parking is going to be a challenge. They have three large lots, plus lots of street parking, but if you get there in the afternoon, expect to wait and cross your fingers before finding a spot. 2) The main building is basically a large warehouse, so there's no protection from the weather. If it's boiling outside, it'll be boiling and steaming inside.We've driven up to visit twice, and both times it was in the dead of summer. The first time we were there for a gamer's convention, which took place in the center of the building (during un-convention times they have tables set up for people interested in getting their Magic the Gathering on.)We do enjoy strolling through the aisles to look at all the fun and interesting collectibles. The merchandise ranges from licensed items to hand-crafted crafts to throw-back memorabilia. It's a nice way to spend a couple hours of the afternoon, and even better that they don't charge to get inside.They do have a mini-convenience store at the front, as well as a food stand that does a very lively business. They have a few tables set up outside if you decide to eat, but it gets crowded out there.",SimeyTravels
10,Show was good; event customer service was ATROCIOUS and I'll never return!,"My friends and I decided to take an impromptu road trip from the Bay Area to Frank & Sons because it was announced that WWE star, Chris Jericho would be in attendance. The center that the show is held in is quite spacious, and there are a great many vendors selling things ranging from toys to video games to sports jerseys.When we arrived at the show around 11:00am, and parking was a bear, but we eventually found a spot. When we went inside, we noticed that a line had already formed for Jericho, so we lined up with the rest of the fans. We were probably 70th in line among nearly 400 fans.As the line started moving after Jericho arrived and started signing, we noticed that quite a few people had tickets, so my friend got out of line to inquire. At NO point in time was an announcement made over the intercom, nor did anyone say that a ticket was required otherwise we would have gone to the desk and purchased one. We’ve gone to dozens of WWE signings and at ALL of them, they accepted cash up front, so we figured that was the way this signing would be handled.My friend spoke to a gentleman wearing a pinkish colored shirt, gray khakis and bifocal glasses who seemed to be in charge and explained the situation, and was told quite rudely that the event was sold out and that we had to get out of line. He treated us as if we cut in line and was trying to gain an unfair advantage over everyone else. We both tried to explain that no announcement was made, we had gotten in line very early and there was no line conductor stating that we had to have a ticket. In addition, there were dozens of witnesses to corroborate our story, but he apparently was in a foul mood, had heard enough, told us that “Chris isn’t taking any more people” and threatened to call security on us as if we were causing a disturbance or trying to rush our way to the front. If he had said, “I’m sorry, but let me see what I can do,” OR “You can wait here, but I can’t make any promises” like a professional in customer service, we would have been fine with that, but he went out of his way to be completely rude and snarky, and then did call security.Dejected, we got out of line and decided to shop around with the local vendors to try and process what just happened; we had to come to the realization that we drove six hours for nothing! After making a couple of impulse purchases to try and drown our sorrows, we decided to go back to see if they were taking any extras. We went to the desk in back of the area where the tickets were apparently sold and explained our dilemma to the two people there, who were apologetic and friendly. While talking to them, the guy in the glasses, storms back to where we were, interrupts and very rudely says, “They know the deal. We’re not taking any more, and you’re wasting your time!” I responded with, “Well, it’s my time to waste.” He then responds with, “Well you can’t waste it here, so you have to leave!” I then said that I’m a paying customer at this show and showed him the merchandise I purchased, but he didn’t care, and again, called security as if we were doing something illegal. Keep in mind that we were nowhere near the line. Additionally, there were small groups of people loitering in this area that he didn’t seem to be too concerned about- just us. Instead of matching his rudeness and uncouthness, I told him to “have a nice day” and walked off as he was calling security, and went to do some more browsing and shopping. He responded with a snide, “Have a nice drive back (to the Bay Area).” Dealing with this guy was like dealing with a high school bully, or a guy who has been bullied all his life, gained a position of power and abuses it to take his ineptitudes and frustrations out on the world.About twenty minutes had passed and I happened to walk by as I was browsing and saw a line forming. I inquired what the line was for and some fans told me that they were taking walk-ups for Jericho. So, after all that barking, threatening, rudeness and calling security TWICE for no apparent reason, they are letting people in? The same guy in the glasses was at the desk taking money for the signatures and photo-ops and gave a half-hearted apology, but that, in no way, shape or form justifies or condones the way we were treated and spoken to.Overall, we got what we came for, but to be treated like that was completely uncalled for. I’ve attended a great many WWE events, toy shows and comic conventions all across the country and in all my travels have never been treated so poorly. I am appalled and disgusted. That guy needs a serious attitude adjustment and a crash course in customer service. Someone with those kinds of people skills should not be in his position. Furthermore, someone should take responsibility for not announcing that a ticket was required for the event. When we lined up, no one said anything and no announcements were made yet we were allowed to get in line. Ultimately, we got what we came for, this whole ordeal put a serious damper on my first ever Frank & Sons, and it’s doubtful that I’ll ever return.",sylent_asassin
50,"Stuff you need, 1000's of items you dont but may want!","In Business since 1988, 89 at walnut location, moved to San Jose Location in 1995. Free Parking, Free Entrance. Food Vendors: Yes, Drink and Ice Cream: Yes. Reasonable Price: yes. 8 Full Rows, approx 10 to 15 vendors per row, some with larger than others locations. Sports Cards, to Comic Books, to game cards (Pokemon and magic the gathering) to Sports memorabilia. Barbies to Sci-Fi and lots of toys! Figures, Wrestling and more!!! Hint: First Time, Bring Minimal Money and Scope it out. Some vendors have the same items, and lower prices can be had, upon waiting. Also. Aisles 100, to 500 are more sports related, as 500 to 800 and the game card section is more toys and Not Sports Related. Happy Shopping.",Andrew G
30,Losing is vibe,"Every trip I have to La Frank and sons has been a go to place for us and sadly each time it has been more and more disappointing over the years.No matter how hard you look the gems that you used to find are no more, most stalls are as expensive as normal retail shops and really just carrying the same items.There are less comic sellers, less deals, less of everything.Would I keep going - NO I don't think so.",chris w
50,Interesting,"This place has a little bit of everything. Free sports memorabilia to card collecting and pin collecting and much more. this is the fanatic, the Nerd and Geeks Warehouse . I'll stop on occasion to pick up some sign memorabilia",jbamf21
30,Collectibles Hunting,"Have been to this Show several times, hunting for good deals for my kids. We usually leave with some cool item and vendors are usually helpful. This show is definitely for all ages from adult collectors to small children. I totally recommend that you dress lightly as it gets a lil stuffy on warm days.",Luis Z
50,Collectors Heaven!,"Best place to find collectibles of comics, toys, star wars, sports, etc. After visiting this place you will never want to go to your local comic book store again.",StonewallJackson2015
20,How much will you spend on collectibles?,"This is a warehouse that has individual sellers with their own booths. Kind of like an indoor swap meet with all the collectibles you can possibly imagine. However ... that does not mean that the prices on the items are not retail prices. When I see a place with an advertisement like this, I get the impression that the prices would be negotiable and certainly cheaper than an online selling sight like eBay. The parking situation is ridiculous but it seems like its mostly from the people who work inside the show. This is NOT a auction my any means and unless you're a die-hard collector with a fat wallet, you're going to be sadly disappointed especially if you made the mistake of bringing your kids with you!",Linda B
50,View collectible cards and stamps.,"A tremendous number of card and movie collectibles. Very few stamp vendors. Lots of parking, easy admission.",Randy A
40,A must for collectors!!!,"I collect pops and my husband suggested we go to Frank and Son's when we visited his family in California. I thought it would be a small place with a few vendors and maybe the odd rare item. I couldn't have been more wrong. The place is full of vendors selling everything from comics to game cards and thankfully lots of pops!! I was in geek Heaven. I bought about 10 times but could easily have doubled that if i had taken more cash. The vendors i dealt with were friendly and open to appropriate haggling, don't be stupid with your negotiations these guys know their stuff.They had refreshments and bathrooms on site which was great as it gets hot in there. The only reason i gave it 4 stars was the parking. They have a small car park for the amount of customers they get. You can also park on the road but again this is limited and you can end up parking quite far away. My advice get there early. We arrived the first time 15 minutes after it opened and found a spot in the car park, the next time we arrived 3 hours after opening and were lucky to snag a place on the road about a 5 minute walk away.Its only open Wed 3-9 and Saturday from 9am but its totally worth it. One of the highlights from our trip.",DrEm1982
50,Geek Heaven!,"I am from Sydney and I have never seen anything like this place before in my life. The atmosphere at Frank and Sons rivals even some of the conventions we have in my country (and the place is open twice a week?). Next time I come to LA, I will definitely make another visit here.",Chris S
50,Simply amazing place if you collect pop culture,The place is gigantic and jam packed with vendors and their goods. I was there for 5 hoursand still didn't see all of it .Bring lots of money because you WILL find something that you must have.Can't wait to go back,hiplainsdrifters
40,Great place for collectors of all ages,"I went here on a whim with a friend of mine, and wow, is this place cool!The building is pretty big, but lacks in parking, so be sure to get there early to ensure you can get a good spot.From sports memorabilia to trading cards to action figures and everything in between, this place has it all. I've gotten a handful of nice things there over the years, even things from overseas that I never knew existed. Just walk around the whole place first before making any purchase -- you never know if another booth may have it for less. :)",irishsiren32
50,Nerd heaven in City of Industry!,"A collector's dream, Frank and Son show is a MUST STOP whenever I'm in the LA area. I'm primarily an Anime/Sci-Fi enthusiast, and I always end up finding something interesting or cool when I browse the aisles. Tons of vendors selling anything and everything you can imagine. A fun shopping experience that allows your inner nerd to go hog wild. Just keep track of your spending. It's easy to go overboard if you're not careful.",Graham G
40,Lots of Hot Wheels and other collectables,"This seems to be the place where you can find what will be the collectables of tomorrow if you are into Star Wars, Harry Potter, Star Trek, Anime, Hot Wheels and all that type of stuff. Lot of vendors carry the same stuff, so you need to look at all of them before you buy anything.",geotech522
50,GR8 PLACE BRING THE KIDS,This place is a fun outing for the kids or the kid in you. collectables and more at this place. you will find things that you haven't seen since you were a kid. the kids will love all the superhero stuff. they also have autograph days with movie and sports stars.,LYDIA M
50,To much fun and it's free!,"My friend took me to this spot a few years ago and we go every time I go visit LA. I love all the toys! I still have to take my boyfriend. I was hoping to be there this past weekend, but sadly flights to CA are now ridiculous, but hope that one day I can go back. I love Frank & Son! Awesome place to visit!",WickedCakes
40,Great place for hard-to-find collectibles!,"It would be difficult for me to try and list the huge diversity of things you can find here. They have comic book collectibles, action figures, video games, CCG's, cosplay items, sports memorabilia, and so much more!My only two issues are the temperature - which can be a challenge since it is located inside a big warehouse, and parking can be difficult even if they have two dedicated lots - but that only goes to show that they have a great collection of merchandise.",anjelloe9
40,Variety of collectible stuff and many vendors,"This reminds me of a swap meet with a bunch of stuff. However, the people I see here and talk to seem very nice. They help with questions and give discounts without an attitude. I ask but also am reasonable. I wish they would have more seats at the eating area and inside to be able to rest up a bit while shopping. I enjoy the Disney collectibles. Keep in mind like with everything else- look for the fake things. However, when I ask if something is a replica or authentic, the vendors I shop with have never lied to me. They were truthful. It is all indoors and sometimes it can smell a bit but mostly from the visitors. That is why this is a 4 star. I will come back and I recommend if you have not been here and collect stuff then come by.",BeataBallo
50,Always a destination whenever we come to SoCal!,"If we are in SoCal on a Wednesday or Saturday, we always make sure to stop by Frank & Sons. It's an awesome place for the kids if they're into collectibles. Our boys are 11 years old and it was better than Toys R Us!",echamin
50,A great collectible show with many choices.,I enjoyed how many options for collectibles and gift ideas were available in this location. The staff were very kind. The only con would be parking on busy days when celebrities are present.Tip: Come early to find parking. If you arrive at the show late it may be challenging to find good parking.,Alvi
50,take a lot of cash! amazing!,"Oh my gosh, this place is amazing! Huge warehouse of smaller collectibles stores, from toys to paintings to masks, its awesome! I suggest if you are into this take comfy shoes, and a wallet of cash! Have since seen some of the stuff in ""normal"" stores and comic book stores and it is CHEAPER HERE!I suggest going wednesday-3pm-9pm.free entry and free parking.... if you can find one!",MzFallen1
40,Frank & Sons Collectible Show,"Only open Wednesdays 3:00pm - 9:00pm & Saturdays 9:00am - 5:00pm. Be sure get there early to find parking. This show is a nerds paradise and has everything from action figures to handmade collectible arts and crafts. This place is a fairly large warehouse with individual venders selling there own unique collectibles. Everyone is welcomed to trade, sell, and barter with the venders here which makes this place really fun. Frank & Sons also has exclusive events here on a regular bases.Famous people like Stan Lee come to Franks to sign autographs for fans. There is no telling what you will find here at this one of a kind show!",Quintana O
40,"Fun place for the nerd in you, but be saavy about the prices of items!","I have been going to Frank and Son Collectible Show since they first started! It is fun, but it also about business and you should beware of vendors who are out to gouge the public for profit! I have made many friends there over the years and most vendors are cool, but just be warned. Always remember to shop around for the same item. Most likely you will find it cheaper from another vendor. All in all it is a neat place to hang out and or purchase some collectibles. Every month they have sports figures and pseudo celebrities signing autographs for money as well.",Michael R
50,Fanboy Valhallah,"My brother and I visit Frank & Son's almost every other week, and we're never disappointed. Whether you're looking for comics, toys, or even sports memorabilia, this is the place to visit. And most dealers sell at pretty fair prices, so you're bound to save a penny or two. However, if you're visiting during the Summer months, beware! It can get ridiculously hot and stuffy in the warehouse where the show takes place, and so it's best to come by when the weather is mild.",Michael L
50,All of my childhood toys in one place!,"I love Franks. Haven't been here in years and its like the place has stood still in time. If you're looking for new, old, or obscure collectibles, you should start your search here! It's local and there's no admission fee!!!",kurtz777
50,My go to place to find stuff that I can't find,"Been going here forever, and yes, it's like a Comic-Con every week. Since I started my Hot Wheels collection, this is my go-to place for the stuff I can't find, and for anything collectible (Transformers, sports cards, robots, and TOYS). While it can be crowded on Saturdays, it's worth it to go to sometimes on Wednesday nights, when there is less of a crowd (though I have to fight traffic to get here). Glad there are places like F&S.",D L
40,Mini Comic-Con,"Been here many times over the past decade. Some awesome looking things for sale but they come with hefty price tags as this is a collectible show. Too many card trading tables though.If you can't afford to go to a real Comic-con, this is a decent runner up with no entry fees.",jay_888
