40,Have fresh what you need stuff,"Fresh veggies, fruits, breads, salsa, chips all at verry reasonable orices every Wednesday. Only a couple lunch booths but still worth a visit. Some jewerly and homemade wears, but forus locals its all about fresh veggies, fruits, breads. Very friendly customers and vendors.. Right in the large restaurant area of Hermosa... Parking not to bad the time of day you would go....",Judpma012
20,No Organic Produce,"I live in HB, Love farmers markets. This one is very close, walking distance. Both of them, one on Friday and the other on Wed...neither have organic fruits or veggies. The while purpose of the farmers markets for me is the local ORGANIC produce. What a HUGE letdown. Probably 2 of the worst FM in all of SOCAL.",RastaSurfer
40,Weekly event for food and fashion junkies,"The weekly market in Pier Plaza is strong on food stalls with fresh fruit & vegetables, bakery, Korean speciality foods, yoghurts cheeses & dairy products and a specialist in cooking oils. There are also a few stalls offering woven cane products, metal sculptures and artisan jewellery. The same bunch of stall-holders set up for business every Friday on the parking lot behind the library & city hall and there are lots of instant meal providers there too. Worth a visit.",Steve M
50,Farmers Market at the beach,"Great farmers market with lots of food, art, vegetable and flower booths. The best thing though is that it is right on Pier Ave next to the pier and fight on the beach. A must go every week on wednesdays.",Flairadise
50,Small but nice,We visited the farmers market this past week. While small it has enough variety to make it an interesting stop during a bike ride between the other piers nearby.,BoboTravlr
50,Delicious Fruit,"We happened to be in town in Hermosa Beach the day of this Farmer's Market. We found nectarines, berries and many other fruits and vegetables.Highly recommend supporting this Farmer's Market.",AthleticTouchMom

30,Small but Fun,"This Farmer's Market is on the small side, but the produce was beautiful and vendors graciously offered tastings of their seasonal best. A relaxing experience that's a short uphill walk from the beach. Food trucks were selling snacks and stalls with jewelry, baskets, and assorted wares were also on-site. The market takes place every Friday from noon until 4:00 pm.",Julie W
