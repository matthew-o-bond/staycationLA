30,"Beautiful Stadium, but they won't let you see much","We came by the Rose Bowl... everyone in our Business Group was either BigTen or PAC12 alumni. The plaza in front was cool, to see all the schools and the named bricks. The stadium is pretty amazing to look at. The park in the area is really nice.WHILE I liked the plaza, it was a little disappointing to not be able to see any more of the stadium. It was a Thursday afternoon in January ... nothing going on, and a guard at the gate, but he wouldn't let us in, even just for a minute to look around. MANY other stadiums have one portal open to look around or something like that. It was a bit disappointing to just see from the gates.",Xenon
40,An iconic stadium in a beautiful setting,"Located in Pasadena adjacent to Brookside Golf Course and the lovely Arroyo Seco canyon, the Rose Bowl is an example of an older stadium that has managed to age well. Opened in October 1922, the stadium is recognized as a National Historic Landmark and has a seating capacity of 92,542. In addition to being the home of the annual Rose Bowl game and UCLA football, it has hosted the collegiate football national championship game, numerous concerts and both World Cup and Olympic soccer finals.Like many large-capacity college football stadiums, the Rose Bowl has both bleacher seating and full seats. The sections that provide seat backs are along the sidelines between the end zones on the lower level. So, if having a seat back and arm rests is important to you, be sure to ask about it when purchasing a ticket.Being located practically in the middle of an affluent neighborhood a bit of distance from any freeway, the Rose Bowl stadium presents a challenge when it comes to both access roads and parking. Allow yourself plenty of extra time driving in as you will be driving through residential areas and most likely parking on the actual golf course. Those with knee or hip issues should take note because you’ll be walking some distance on the fairway, which is not flat until you get to a paved golf cart path.NOTE that security is taken very seriously at the Rose Bowl, so they are very strict about what you can bring in with you. For example, you can’t bring in backpacks, camera bags or large purses (check their website for their detailed policy). Also NOTE that if there is a threat of inclement weather, you should definitely wear rain gear as umbrellas are not allowed in the stadium.I hadn’t been to the Rose Bowl in decades and was impressed by its condition. The seats were in good shape, the sightlines were good and the staff was professional. Being an older stadium, you won’t have some of the more modern amenities (like giant scoreboards and video screens), but the lack thereof shouldn’t get in the way of your appreciating a game.Keep in mind that nothing about going to a game or concert at this type of venue is cheap, whether it’s parking, concessions or souvenirs. As long as you keep that in mind and are prepared, you can have a very enjoyable time at the Rose Bowl.",BruinDan
50,Lots of history in a beautiful setting,"Rose Bowl Stadium is quite unique. The stadium has no concourses all the vendors and facilities are outside of the stadium. When you enter the stadium you walk right into the seating bowl. We were seated on the West side so had shade in the afternoon and did not have to deal with the sun in our eyes. Sunset was amazing, some of the famed LA/Pasadena haze made it even more spectacular. If you get a chance go. All seats on the sides have backs and arm rests. Seats in the end zones are traditional bleachers.",Busylady21
50,A Bucket List that Did not Disappoint!!!!,"This iconic stadium was a fabulous place to be during the 2020 Rose Bowl. Even though our Badgers lost, the weather, the atmosphere, and the entire Rose Bowl scene resulted in a lifetime of memories!",Keith B
50,Best stadium for college football in the country,The Rose Bowl is the best college football game every season whether your team is playing in the game or not. It truly is the “Granddaddy of them all” (in the words of the great Keith Jackson). There literally is not a bad seat in the stadium. There is nothing like the sunset late in the 3rd quarter as the sun sets and lights up the San Gabriel Mountains. The pageantry and tradition of the Rose Bowl game is unmatched in college football. And when your team plays in and wins the Rose Bowl it is literally a dream come true. Go Ducks!,Steven T
10,Don't go if you need a seatback,"This was my 2nd time to the Rose Bowl. I found out the 1st time that the seats don't have backs. I have back problems so this time I brought a stadium seat. They wouldn't allow me to bring it in. As I was going to my seat I saw someone with a stadium seat identcal to mine. They said no one even mentioned it, they had no issues bringing it in. This was my last time at this stadium.",SeeTheW0rld62
50,Great Stadium!,I have been to this stadium many times and the experience was always great. Parking is easy but pricey and the area around the stadium are beautiful. The stadium inside is really big and you don't feel all the crowd in there. There is plenty of space for everyone.The only downside is that the stadium is not covered but you don't need any cover in California since it never rains here.,F-F
50,Great to experience world-class stadium,"A marvellous sporting ground, it was completed in 1922 and hosts the annual Rose Bowl Game.Expanded since its inauguration it now has a seating capacity of over 90,000 spectators.It is the home ground for the UCLA football team.",permia
50,Nice Place for a Run,The Rose Bowl in Pasadena is a great place to go for a run. I go there often to run the three mile loop. I like that the loop around the Rose Bowl is three miles and perfect for training for a race. Surrounding the Rose Bowl is the famous stadium and a golf course. The loop goes around both. I would recommend the Rose Bowl for anyone looking for a place to run or walk.,Daniel L
50,Fun at the Flea Market,"This is my first time to visit the flea market and I am glad I didThere are a lot of interesting items to purchase for home and for giftsThe prices and variety are greatI plan to return next month in preparation for holiday gift givingIf you plan to go - make sure you bring a hat, sunscreen and wear tennis shoes. Prepare for lots of walking.Also - there is not a lot of options for vegans so make sure to pack a snack or eat before coming",Lourdes Maria C
50,UCLA game at the infamous Rose Bowl,"You’ve grown up watching the games played here, now come experience it! We watched UCLA play in their home stadium and experienced the grandeur of the views, so many seats are great! We visited with a former Bruin Linebacker (my future son in law) so we’re able to go on the field before the game. The turf was in great shape and it was an awe inspiring experience to look up into the crowds ready for the game. The food vendors were kind and the offerings were tasty and well priced. It’s an old stadium so the seats are a bit tight and there’s not much leg room if you are a tall person, but it’s worth the experience to attend. Of course the 50 yard line seats were fantastic. Bring sunscreen it gets hot on the sunny side of the field.",FantescaGirl
10,The worst sporting event I have ever been to OU vs UCLA. Poor facilities management,"To whomever would care who manages the facilities at the Rose Bowl you should be ashamed. I was at the UCLA game 9/14/2019. As someone who paid money to go to this game and the respect that I as well as the fans that attended spending $100s or not $1000 to go were given is a travesty. We had to wait in line as only 3 gates were opened, i did not get to my seat until the end of the 1st quarter!! How is that even possible. You charge the highest prices have the worst facilities and that is the best you can do. What a shame, it is no wonder why the game is so poorly attended. Sure I wont be getting a refund or even a 'so sorry' you obviously dont care. Dont believe what you hear people thinking the Grand Daddy of them all is iconic.. well it once was whoever is running the show right now, should be FIRED!!!",J.B. B
40,Why not let us wait instead of walk for the shuttle?,"I went to the Stones concert. The venue was great, and the shuttle system to the stadium was awesome. Even the lady's rooms were great - very clean and absolutely no waiting. But the shuttle going back was a nightmare, and unnecessary so.All they had to do was to create a big space at their huge yard where people can just sit and wait for their turn to board the shuttle. Instead, there was a queue all around that yard that lasted for miles. It did constantly move, but that meant that old-timers with back/leg problems had to keep walking. We audience were so tired from the wonderful show that we couldn't even think of raising our voices, conjuring better ideas, or even enjoy conversation to kill time.The shuttle system didn't seem to consider the fact that when a concert ends very late in the evening, the 60,000 audience that showed up one by one during the day would now try to go back to the same little spot in the city all at the same time. Big cities like Tokyo would typically have restaurants and bars to kill time, and public transportation that travel to various directions, but the downside of Rose Bowl is that they don't/can't have any of that. The cold temperature up in the hills doesn't help.It's such a pity when everything else about this grassy stadium is so wonderful. I hope the system is improved so that I could see my favorite band at the Rose Bowl again. Again, at least there should've been a waiting space instead of a queue.",coolboat
40,Rolling Stones,The concert was great-parking was OK-but getting there was atraffic nightmare with street closures etc.,elel77
50,Great concert venue!,"I was happily surprised at the sound quality at the Rolling Stones show last week! This was my first time at the Rose Bowl and I would definitely go back! However, plan to be sitting or standing a while to leave, We took the shuttle, took us 2 1/2 hours in line to just get to the buses! Cars were in long lines as well, though they were long gone before we got close to shuttle buses. There is no ride share in the arroyo so you can't take Lyft or Uber there, now that I know how to manage it I will plan better for next show!",HCOverlord
50,Rolling Stones concert,"We had an amazing experience. Getting from our hotel to parking (8 miles) took just 40 minutes (not bad for a sold-out concert AND LA traffic). Getting OUT, however, took an hour and 15 minutes. We let most of the crowd get out so we wouldn't have to let our car idle forever. Once we started the car, it was about 30 minutes to get out onto the streets. Waze was very helpful re-routing us because they had a lot of streets blocked off to control traffic. We saw a lot of people walking to the downtown area. That might have been a better place to park, but we didn't know. We don't live there. Before the show, there were lots of food and drink vendors. $7 for a bottle of water was too much, but it is what it is. Once we got in there were really good vendors inside the gates too. After the show, one place was still serving food. Outside the gates, the hot dog carts are everywhere and they smell really good, but I overheard someone say it was the worst hot dog he ever had. Be sure to have your clear plastic purse. I carried my items in a gallon ziploc bag then saw people with these purses. That would have been WAY more convenient and easier than having to keep a grip on the bag. Security was high, but the lines moved quickly.",anybody_10
40,Rolling Stones were great,"Great show,but the Rose Bowl was not great. No one could give us any information as they were just hired for the event. Seating was haphazard and uncomfortable and we were directed to wrong seats (by staff)for over an hour and had to move.Worst venue ever for the Rolling Stones,but their show was great!",SKSA
40,Historic stadium with pros and cons,"My husband and i went to The Rolling Stones concert here in August 2019 and it was a great experiment overall but definitely some things to keep in mind. We also attended the rose bowl New Years football game and had similar results. We decided to drive since it was a Thursday and getting an Uber would have been very difficult that night to leave. That being said, we pre paid for parking for $40 and it took so long to get in and park because of the one route in and so much traffic.Be prepared to walk a ways to the entrances and the main gripe I have about this venue is the few entrances and lack of organization they need more entrances and if that’s not feasible, there needs to be staff to direct or more organized lines to get into to feed into structured lines to get through security. Each time we have come, there are people cutting through and breaking in line and results in others getting angry and very uneven waits. I know it’s a historic venue with many additions but the logistics of getting in and out need to be addressed. Besides that, the only qualm I have are the sizes of each spot (concrete bleacher style with numbers) and not much space between rows to get in and out. We are slim people in our thirties so it wasn’t bad but we saw many older people struggling to get to their seats and be comfortable in their seats. It helps with standing for the show but still hard to get in and out. The restrooms are surprisingly not as bad as other venues in terms of lines and cleanliness so that was a plus and there were plenty of concessions so the lines weren’t bad there either. It was an amazing venue to see a concert especially The Rolling Stones so totally worth it but just know to leave really early to get there and be prepared for lines getting in and out of both the venue and parking lot.Leaving was not a walk in the park but once we get out of the initial madness in the parking lot, luckily google routed us to neighborhood back roads and we got out pretty fast after the initial wait.",Emily T

30,Goods and Bads.,Went to see The Rolling Stones here. We got there an hour early and it took 30 minutes to get through the traffic leading to parking. Parking was $50.00 for the show!!! This was definitely an unpleasant surprise. Parking was on a golf course and was pretty far from the entrance. Wear comfortable shoes as you will walk a lot through grass and some dirt too. Two separate check-in areas to go through. When we got through the first one I got into a line to get a glass of wine (listed on the menu signs all the way around the selling table) after waiting 10-15 minutes in line I as told they don’t have wine and I will probably not get any! She said go into the stadium and they had plenty. So we made our way through the 2nd entrance line. Got into another line for wine and once again no wine. Hard alcohol and beer only. I finally found a place with wine...white only though. WTH! So white wine it was. Oh...women buy a clear purse if you want to bring one in or put your stuff in ziplock bags. No purses allowed unless clear. I read about this before we went and found a small clear purse at Ross for cheap. The stadium itself is HUGE! The biggest venue we had been to for a concert. If you are on the upper levels take binoculars because it is pretty far away from the stage/field. The sound was good for the most part with a few glitches here and there. Bathrooms were clean and lines moved quickly. Getting out after the concert is hell so just chill out and wait . Only one road out and thousands of vehicles.Of course we saw The Rolling Stones so that made up for any negatives!,Jalama
30,Rolling Stones,"There are many ways to arrive at the Rose Bowl. Many people take a shuttle from the Parsons lot and others take Uber or a Lyft.After much thought we decided to go to the show 3 hours before showtime and found a place to park easily and once the show was over we bolted to our car and we’re out in 20 minutes back to our hotel.With this many people, 60 to 80,000 people, I would highly NOT suggest that you take a Lyft or Uber. We did this at the Paul McCartney show at Dodger Stadium and it took us over 2 hours to get a ride. I will never do that again unless I am at a small venue. There were many people who simply walked from the old town Pasadena areaThere was a very large staff of security however each person seemed to be from a different unit or department. There was clearly no additional preparation for an older crowd to see the Rolling Stones. We are in our 50s and did not have an issue however there were many many people who were having issues standing in the hot sun and not getting any assistance from their car to the entrance or from the entrance to their seat. One could argue that if you were not able to assist yourself then you shouldn’t go but that doesn’t seem to be the theme most places. AlI I could say is that if I had trouble walking and knew the crowd was going to be huge, I would personally probably opt out of even attending the event. Rose Bowl would argue that there was a separate ADA Entrance however it was in the sun with no separate seating for sun protection and it was really nothing more than a separate line. This scenario was clearly inadequate and I felt sorry for the people that needed help because the Rose Bowl was grossly unprepared. There was a guy behind us in line who complained to several security people that walked by while we were waiting to get into the Rose Bowl and none of them really seemed to have an answer or any empathy.aWe did see one person have a medical problem while standing in line to get into the event and it seemed to be chaos with at least four different types of uniforms and an ambulance drove right by even though there were 3 dozen people screaming and yelling “over here“!I would strongly suggest that you arrive early for any event. Since we arrived early it was very easy to wander around and the bathrooms were good for the both men and women and there was plenty of places for food and drink. As it got closer to showtime everything was extremely crowded.Although there is a ridiculous gun problem in this country the bag policy for the Rose Bowl was the tightest security of any event I have ever been to and I have been to hundreds of events. It was more extreme than flying and getting through TSA security. You absolutely need to pay attention to the bag policy because if you do not it will make your day miserable!! My wife ended up taking a very small cell phone case which she could put her ID, insurance card and some cash and that was all. I took nothing in except what fit in my shorts pockets: wallet, phone and glasses.The place itself is very old and the seats are extremely tight. I took a couple of photos that you can see below. I am 5’11” and my wife is 5’6” and you can see that we were extremely tight sitting in the seats. If you are a large person you will most likely be very uncomfortable in the seats.So now the question remains, would I go again: if there was an event that I absolutely had to see I would go early and pay very close attention to all the announcements that come on email, Facebook and Instagram prior to arriving at the event. Unfortunately for older folks it seems as though you’re forced to follow your team or event on social media to get the most information directly from the promoters. Other than that I think the place is too large and too outdated and would much rather see a game or a show in a more modern place like the Forum or the new stadium that is being the built right next to the Forum.Of course the Rolling Stones show itself was amazing and awesome so I put up with everything that I mentioned above but you should be aware of all the details if you choose to go to the Rose Bowl.",ItchyFeet

10,YOU WOULD THINK THEY HAVE NEVER DONE THIS BEFORE,"I attended the fireworks at the Rose Bowl. From the beginning things were disorganized and different personnel gave different information. We took Lyft and read that dropoff would be at Lot H. Lot H waved us on and we spent a half hour riding around the bowl and golf course and landed on the wrong side of Lot H. No one knew anything. Where to enter? Different misinformation. Then, the transparent bag policy. Though it appears on the website, it should be prominently displayed on tickets, etc. OK, check our bag. $10 to do so. We noticed that each bag was tagged, but put on any table or shelf the clerk found convenient. Sue enough it was chaos when we went to retrieve the bag. YOU TOLD THE CLERK WHAT YOUR BAG LOOKS LIKE AND THEY SEARCH THROUGH THE SEVERAL THOUSAND BAGS TO FIND IT.

40,"Beautiful, classic venue","This stadium and its surroundings host lots of really fun, different events, so your experience will depend on what event you are attending and if it's daytime or night time. I have been here for concerts, football games, CPR training, festivals with multiple concerts on the grounds, the Air and Style show with a 14-story high ski ramp, etc. So these comments refer to events inside the gates, not on the grounds: Safety is run by Pasadena PD and Pasadena Fire Department and they are top-notch. Ticket checking for getting to your seats (such as for UCLA football games) is done by contractors and the employees do their best but sometimes they will not know the answer to everything. Sometimes there are ""Helpful Honda"" teams providing courtesy shuttle service but other times not. Some general advice: avoid blisters by wearing comfortable shoes since you might have a long walk from your parking location to the stadium. Be prepared with sunscreen and drinking water and a hat, if it is a hot day. There might also be misting stations or cooling buses that you can go sit in. If you have anybody in your party with mobility issues, don't assume that it will be easy. You might want to bring your own wheelchair into the stadium, because they do have wheelchair seat spaces and sometimes the venue does not have enough wheelchairs for the request. How the other patrons behave is going to depend to some extent on whether alcohol is for sale (not at UCLA football games, but often yes at other sporting events or concerts). In the afternoon, the west side of the stadium is in the shade long before the eastern side is in the shade, so if you don't want to be sitting in that much sun, get seats on the west side.",Antarctix7

20,"Saw BTS. Fabulous place, poor service","Absolutely loved the venue. After reading lots of reviews, I was expecting a horrible experience. I was surprised that the venue was awesome. Unlike what I read, there were lots of entrances, the seats had lots of room, and the seating was not super steep, like lots of venues that I have been in. BUT, the security staff, ushers, and just about everyone who worked there knew absolutely nothing and were mostly rude. But this didn't surprise me, as my experience on the phone prior to the event was about the same. It wasn't until I got to the premium seating that I felt like there were knowledgeable and caring people at the venue. The premium staff is first class all the way! And my experience in the club seats was amazing. Great food, great service and nice people. I only wish the view was better. If you are not in premium seating, you are on your own. And if make a wrong turn, you will be yelled at. It is a difficult venue to get in and out of, so helpful staff would be great. The current security staff should get some customer service training and be taught how to navigate the area. The first day there was a lack of organization outside of the arena, but I will give them props for making changes and being slightly better organized for the second day. Of course, we were there for the BTS concert, which has an amazing and courteous rule-abiding fan base. I don't know if I would want to attend an event there that brings in more of a party crowd. I could see it being utter mayhem.",love la
10,Worst concert venue ever,"We attended the BTS concert last weekend and the facility had a completely inadequate capacity for women's bathrooms and for organization within the venue. Toilets were breaking down, staff weren't letting women use the men's restroom (about 95% of the attendees were women) and the wait in line to use the bathroom was around 45 minutes to an hour. I would have thought more planning would have occurred to handle the crowd size and type of attendees but it was absolutely miserable. There was no organization to merch lines and those waits were even longer.",lpunkin
50,This is one of Pasadena's most famous attractions,"While I am in my mid-seventies, I didn't step into the Rose Bowl until I was about 23. I knew the Rose Bowl as the site of the Biggest and Best New Years' college football games only. I didn't follow football so all I knew really was that the Rose Bowl game on New Years' Day with everyone I knew in Los Angeles.Then I went to a Pasadena High School graduation held at the Rose Bowl. Three different high schools were graduating an outstanding group of students and we were there in person. I was so impressed by the size and quality of the stadium. It was exciting to be there after growing up seeing it on TV.Then my husband and I bought our first house and we started going to the Swap Meets held there every month. I had never seen so many antiques in one place and the crowd walking the aisles was friendly and everyone seemed so happy to be out in the sun finding bargains galore.Soon my husband wanted to have a booth of our own to see his hand made and carved leather products. At first we had not realized that we needed to be in line as sellers at 4 or 4:30 AM. That was rough but being there, treating the facility as our own, or at least about 100 sq. ft. of it, was a thrill. It was fun to talk to the buyers.Now as I look back for the purpose of the review I can see why the Rose Bowl is so precious to the families of Pasadena. Actually, the Rose Bowl itself has become the central piece of a very large recreation center for Los Angeles. Now it is at the heart of the area where walkers and hikers enjoy the trails and where dogs enjoy a dog park and where one of the best park grounds offers barbecue facilities and where there is a fine aquatic center. The list goes on and on.",wendy4413
20,High expectations that are never met,"After several disappointing encounters with this venerable stadium, what I can say for certain is that I have no intention of ever going again. It is out dated, the seating is uncomfortable, there are not enough restrooms and too few amenities. Worse, and whether for a sporting event or concert, Pasadena has made getting in and out a nightmare, sucking out whatever enjoyment you might have had for the event you were attending. The question that I could not answer, is how many years a venue must be in business before you figure out transportation? If you want an great example of how to do it right, look no further than L.A. Memorial Coliseum, which is just as old and much easier to get in and out of.",Robert W

The day I arrived I was told I had to pay an extra $40 or leave with no refund, so I paid even after explaining everything to the attendant and showing him the Email. So figured I would get it resolved after I got home. That's not going to happen, Park Jockey said they charged me correctly and that's the end of it.

30,Great Vintage stadium...But also vintage Food Vendors...How To attend the Rose Bowl on a scalped Ticket,"I attended the 2019 Rose Bowl Game, Ohio St. Vs Washington. I didn't have a team in the fight, I just went as a fan of great sporting events. I went to the parade and left at 10:30 and walked from Pasadena City College to the free shuttle line at the start of the parade route (North Pasadena Ave and West Union Street). The guy there told me the line was AT LEAST 45min..It was LOOOOONG and the first of many lines encountered...It was less than 2 miles from there to the stadium so since I had no ticket I hoofed it. The walk was fine but there were not any ticket sellers for the first 1.5 miles....There were maybe 2 homeless looking guys with ""Need A Ticket"" signs...My guess is they were working for someone to acquire low bid tickets to resell...I was checking Stub Hub and at around noon the ticket prices were $130-150 for anything endzone and decent. There were $90-110 tickets available but they were all row 70+ ...a reasonable ""Safe"" get in price but not ideal. There are also the stub hub fees and taxes that make the $90 ticket about $125+ and the stub hub last minute pick up is about a mile due east of the stadium so it's a 2 mile round trip to get the ticket.Once the stadium was visible in the distance I started to notice sellers mulling about...I guess the police don't really care and there were at least 5 guys I passed on my way into the parking lot selling tickets. I found one guy who had about 14 tickets in hand, all grouped in sets of 2 or 4 tickets. I only needed one so he showed me his groups of 4 which would still leave him with 3. One that caught my eye was Tunnel 1 Row 55 seat 121. The face price was $215. I was of course wary of counterfeits as well...So I pulled out my phone and read the barcode with an app that reads barcodes (for scanning shopping cards etc) and the number matched the barcode. The seller was all ""What are you doing?"" I told him I was verifying the barcode. If it's good we have a sale. He said ""We don't rip people off here"" ...I told him I'm from Boston and they do it there so I'm just being careful....I know a guy who bought NCAA tickets for basketball playoffs..He got to the venue and they were like ""Umm..fake..."" He was out over $500..They looked legit when he showed me later but when I scanned the barcode for him it read 0-1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-0-1 even thought he ticket number was some random numbers that looked real...They were fake...Lesson learned.Ticket scanned ok on my app...I offered him a fresh $100 and he was good with that. So for $100 I was in Tunnel 1 with a seatback, 55 rows from the field and I was pretty sure he wouldn't be able to sell the last 3 so I had a good chance of 3 empty seats next to me. I snuck a quick picture of the seller just in case and then ticket in hand headed for the gate...When I was entering and the woman scanned it I said aloud ""Please be real...."" she laughed and said ""You're good, we've had a few of those prayers today"".....I was in...$100....great deal and a great first Rose Bowl..even though I would have appreciated a closer game.Notes...There are not nearly enough food vendors at the Rose Bowl stadium. The lines for regular food were 45 minutes with 4 minutes left in the first half. Once half-time started I was dumbfounded at the inability to get any food without waiting an hour+. There seemed to be no ""Hey hotdog here"" vendors in the stands. I went up to a guy selling pretzels from his vendor bag on the concourse and asked if there was any way to get hot food without waiting in line for an hour...he said ""Tre has some hot dogs....YO TRE, WHERE YOU AT?"" and Tre raised his hand in the crowd from 50 feet away... I went to Tre and sure enough he had about a dozen foil wrapped hot dogs squirreled away in his vendor bag below the hot pretzels...I gave him $10 for a hot dog and told him to keep it. It was worth my time saved...I was going to take 2 but i realized that as soon as he handed me a hot dog a dozen people caught on and all offered him $$ for hot dogs...So I only bough 1...I understood the need for food...They simply have the worst food service model ever. It's woefully unprepared to serve 100,000 people. You cannot get anything to eat in a timely manner from 1 hour before kickoff until you find a restaurant on your way home...Alcohol is everywhere and there are no lines/short lines. It was $14 for a 24oz coors light can and $17 for a 24oz 805 can and the same for a 24oz Modelo...there might have been a I'm pretty sure those were the only beers they offer in the area of the stadium I was in. It would be a hard walk through the crowds to the next area to find alternatives. There was ONLY coors Draft. It was billed as ""Stadium Draft Beer $12"". No other beers...It's pretty much just Coors Light.... They also had pre-mix drinks in little 6 oz? Bottles for $15 that were Jalepeno margarita, cosmos and vodka somethings...They would pour that in a cup of Ice for you...Get a seat with a seat back if possible. It's roomier and more comfortable. Check out the sections before hand but it's basically any seats on the sidelines from end zone to end zone...BRING SUNSCREEN! I had a little travel bottle that I shared with at least 8 other people who were cooking in the sun.Look for security gates further down if the one you are entering in is packed. Gates B and C were packed and a guy said ""Walk to Gate D it's empty"" and sure enough there was nobody there...In in 5 min.There are a lot of porta potties all over the place when you are walking to the stadium and in the parking lot...I ended up walking over 7 miles in and out that day...good exercise.",BrianNorthboro
50,Best setting in America for football!,My family of four recently attended our third Rose Bowl game and needless to say we highly recommend the experience. The setting is absolutely beautiful and something that TV does not do justice. The staff at the stadium is very helpful and courteous. Parking is tricky but if you arrive early and park on the golf course you will be fine - we even walked up to the parade and back with ease. Highly recommend this game and stadium for football fans everywhere!,OSU_Fan1967
30,Rose bowl game,"Went to the game between the Huskies and the Buckeyes.We had been to the parade in the morning and walked to the stadium after the parade.We noticed when walking into the stadium that there was room for very few cars in the area. We had no idea about the parking or how to leave the stadium and were very lucky to have gotten ahold of some others on our tour for the parade during the game or we may still be there. We got into the line for the buses to take us to Pasadena. Little did we know that the line went throughout the area for about a mile ending up in cattle pens before boarding the buses. The buses moved a ton of people back to Pasadena but it took us well over an hour to get on a bus.The stadium setting was beautiful and every seat seemed to have an unobstructed view. The seating was exactly what you would expect for an outdoor stadium and the design with the tunnels entering about half way up the seating area was great. The bathrooms on the concourse were numerous. With 91,000 people you should expect a wait.Although the game itself was rather boring until the last five minutes, I crossed this off the list. Probably would not return just because of the parking.",Papadshaw
50,Rose bowl game,Went for the Rose Bowl game and it was an epic experience. Full house for a great game. Stealth fly over was awesome as well as fireworks and confetti at the end. The stadium staff is extremely friendly and makes the experience even better.,Dave W
10,Plan well ahead,"Took my wife, three sons and one daughter to watch Ohio State play Washington in the 2019 Rose Bowl. Parking was not bad, already had a parking ticket in general parking which is located on the golf course. We were one mile from the stadium so decided to start early heading there so to watch the band prior to kickoff. The one mile walk turned into 1.5 miles based on all the obstacles we had to manage. One was a six foot opening on the golf course that 10,000 people were trying to get through, added 20 minutes. We then arrived at our gate of entry where we found ourselves in a cattle type shoot funneling the same 10,000 people through five security check points, one at a time. Don’t get me wrong, I encourage security but it took one hour from that point to clear security. It’s not like they have this game every ten years. We finally arrived at our seat with the game just starting. I had heard how bad the bathrooms or lack there of were, it was all true, another 30 minute wait. It’s very sad that a venue like this with so many events each year can figure it out. I’ll watch from home next time.",Larry L
50,Once in a (my) lifetime trip to the Rose bowl,The city really knows how to host a bowl game! From the parade to the local restaurants everyone was welcoming! Very impressed that they could host this huge event and still be so laid back and polite.If I had one concern do not take the shuttle back to the Parsons lot after the game. The line was unorganized and took much longer then the walk up the hill would have. We took the Metro out of town after the game which I would recommend.,Joe H
40,Rose Bowl Game,This was a once in a lifetime experience. To experience the magic of the stadium and see our college football team play was memorable. I will say that access to food and restrooms was poor at best. I’m guessing that when this stadium was designed over 100 years ago there was not the knowledge that we have today on ease of access by good design. Food lines easily interfered with foot traffic which greatly hindered both. I would visit the stadium for special events but would not be interested in more frequent attendance.,SuziMac8
50,Great Experience First Rose Bowl,"I’ve read other reviews but we had such a great experience. We researched everything before coming, including reading the reviews, which helped us plan how to get the most out of our day in the easiest way possible. We were traveling with family, one who had a stroke and walked with a cane, so we wanted to make it as easy as possible for him to get around. This did cost us more money but we felt necessary. We paid extra to park in a closer lot, we arrived early and got to enjoy the area and get pictures easily without thousands of people around. We enjoyed the fan area and seeing everything going on. We got to our seats early and enjoyed watching warm ups, seeing coaches come out, etc. Our seats were further up but we had a great view. I don’t have the best eyesight but I saw the entire field and scoreboards clearly.Any problems we had were other patrons acting like jerks, which isn’t the responsibility of the park. I was amazed by people complaining about coming to an event with 91,000+ other people and thinking they are going to show up and walk in. The bathroom situation. Again, there were more bathrooms than I normally see and any line I was in moved quickly.We really enjoyed ourselves. We didn’t rush to leave and watched the after game festivities. It was a little crowded still walking out so we expected trouble getting out of the parking lot and thought we may have to sit for a long time, but we moved right out and rarely stopped moving. We were back to our hotel long before we even thought we would be out of the parking lot. Great game, great venue, lots of fun.",JMinNashville
30,Not an easy stadium to enter or exit,Went for the Rosebowl. The shuttle lines were crazy long so walked to the stadium. ( nice seeing the houses in the area) Once in the stadium the bench seat sections were super cramped . Also very hard to exit the seating section if anyone is trying to climb up the stairs.,Swimmy128
20,"I get the history of it all, but please update this stadium!","After attending the Rose Bowl 2019, I can say...I went to the Rose Bowl. If I had to go there for any other event, I'd think twice about it. It's old, dirty, ill-equipped. Please spend some of that money you are making on parking, drinks and food and put it back into the stadium. Not enough bathrooms, seats are so old, they are rusting apart. Scoreboards and the like are severely lacking. Parking is a nightmare and worse getting out. Cell service is out of the question during/after an event. Forget about Uber, you'll never get a signal.",Annette G
30,Great Experience...Not Very Easy or Fan-Friendly,"We attended the game on Jan 1, 2019 and getting in and out of the Rose Bowl was a nightmare. On the way into the game the lines were VERY long and security had no control of the crowds...people were pushing over the bike racks which made for a HUGE safety hazard and very chaotic atmosphere. Plan to get into the game when gates open or wait in line for an hour plus. Leaving the stadium is not any easier, we ended up walking back to Old Pasadena (2 miles) and grabbing an Uber from there. Once in the stadium the experience is as beautiful as it looks on TV, but plan on a lot of time and walking getting into and leaving the game.",XUACE
50,105th Rose Bowl Ohio State vs. Washington,We went to watch the Rose Bowl for the First time in our lives. So cool. this historical Stadium in Pasadena. great atmosphere. The mother of all Collage Bowl Game. A must See.,Phil_#CGN
20,An Old Dump,"Look I have no choice in going to this old dump to see UCLA football, but this ""iconic"" venue is a dump. Lines are long to use restrooms, even after expanding them. The scoreboard is hard to read, especially on the South side. The replay screen is too small and unless you pay extra, you have to walk up narrow aisles with no railing to your seat. If you want to visit it because it is the Rose Bowl, go. But to see a football game it stinks. Did I mention, that unlike newer stadiums, the seats are way away from the field.",JHS20132013
50,Don’t miss it!,"So much more than just a football stadium. Take the tour, enjoy the history, walk around the grounds that include large parks and brookside golf club.

50,UCLA vs Arizona game,"Read the reviews and we arrived early and we were aware of the bag policy and we went into the stadium early so no issues with long lines.Enjoyed the venue and game. Sat up high enough so the we could see very well. We did lots of research before buying our ticketsSince we read about all the parking and Uber issues we walked from the Courtyard in Old Town. It was an easy and pleasant walk and we felt safe the whole time.The stadium staff was so helpful and there were student was signs asking on saying ""ask me if you need help"".Given some of the bad reviews, we were prepared and it was so cool to this this iconic stadium in person. We had pizza and found the rest rooms fine. Does get cool so we were glad to have brought light jackets as it was a 7:30 game.Would love to return some day and see the Grand Daddy of them all.",parcapecod
40,Beyonce & Jay Z OTRII Concert,"This was our first time to the stadium (visiting from Sydney) for the Beyonce concert. The stadium itself was nice, it was good to be in the open air although the seating was VERY tight, I'm not even tall and my knees were squished against the back of the chair in front and even for standing there was not much room.Prior to the concert we read the email with tips about arriving early to avoid lines (there wasn't much to do when we arrived so we just lined up for ages), Bringing small bags etc and even though I brought the tiniest clutch purse I could, we were told we'd all need to check our bags in for a fee of $10, and get a plastic see through bag to put our things in. The lady on security was very rude, but we left the line, did what she said and returned only to see 10,000 other people with bags much bigger than ours that were allowed in. I totally get the need for security and appreciate that, but really, at least be consistent!The concert was amazing, but once it ended it was mayhem trying to get out. They seemed to invest their energy into getting people into the venue in an organised way but not out. The lines for merchandise were still long and pretty much blocked the whole walkway outside the stadium for people to exit. They also didn't allow any Uber's anywhere near the venue so we ended up walking 30 mins back to the hotel. Lucky we were on such a high about seeing the concert we didn't really care!",Stacey13588
40,ROSE BOWL GREAT VENUE AWFUL CHURROS,"Attended the Utah vs UCLA football games last night, and the Rose Bowl staff were all very friendly and helpful. The Rose Bowl is a great venue. Very clean, great seating, and lots of food choices. However, the inner thing I would absolutely say to avoid, especially at $6 each is their churros. They make the nastiest churros I have ever attempted to eat and just couldn't. My husband couldn't stomach his, and there were people in row behind us who had purchased and they also couldn't eat. In fact, over if the gentlemen said he had purchased one the last time Utah played 2 years ago, and said they were horrible then too. He was really surprised that they were still as bad, but they were. All of us three away. So, great staff, great venue, but stay away from the churros.",dawnb843
50,Beyoncé & Jay Z Concert,"Had a blast while in Pasadena. Went to Beyoncé & Jay Z concert and it wasA W E S O M E... Hardly no traffic because we arrived early. However, after the concert traffic was a nightmare.",JustAretha
50,Beautiful Exhaustion,"As a native of Pasadena, who now lives in Dallas, I’ve been going to the Rose Bowl my entire life. Several of my family members live in walking distance to the Rose Bowl. I’ve been to college and high-school events, flea markets, festivals, and just walking around for exercise. As a child, I used to play and swim at Brookside Park. The Rose Bowl will always be a nostalgic place for me.My most recent visit was on 9/22/18 for the OTR II concert. Prior to the concert, I received several e-mails from the Rose Bowl that stressed the importance of arriving early, the clear-bag policy, and transport to/from the Rose Bowl. We arrived for the concert, via the Rose Bowl Shuttle from the Foothill station, at 5:45pm. When we arrived, there were lines wrapped around the Rose Bowl similar to lines that you see on TV when people are waiting to receive food and water after a natural disaster. The lines gave me anxiety but despite the lines, the staff and security had everything under control (it was organized chaos). Around 6:30pm, the gates were opened and everyone filed into the Rose Bowl in an organized and orderly secured line. Safety is always my priority and I’m thankful that everyone was required to go through a metal detector and all bags were checked. Safety first!!!There were so many places inside the Rose Bowl to get food, beverages, and alcohol. There were also ATMs. I bought a large pink lemonade for $7 and it was refreshing and delicious. I needed this to stay hydrated for all of the dancing I planned on doing for the Queen’s performance.The stadium seating in the Rose Bowl is very uncomfortable. They are made of thick plastic, which is necessary considering it’s an outdoor venue. You’re allowed to bring a seat cushion. My sole purpose for being at the Rose Bowl was to see Beyoncé so having a comfortable seat was NOT a concern for me. Once Beyoncé hit the stage, I was on my feet for the entire duration of the concert.I can’t comment on parking because we took the shuttle from the Foothill station and it was $10 round trip. We took our hotel shuttle to catch the shuttle at the Foothill station for free. After the concert, we filed into another orderly line to take the shuttle back to the Foothill station. It was very orderly but also very exhausting and CROWDED. I’m sure I walked over 2 miles combined getting in/out of the Rose Bowl. Luckily, we were on the first round of shuttles to exit the Rose Bowl, which we strategically planned before the concert. Once we got off the shuttle at the Foothill station, we had a very short walk to our hotel, the Sheraton in Pasadena.Thankfully, I’m in great shape without any health issues and the walking was easy for me. However, if someone has any health issues, he/she will struggle with the logistics of getting in/out of the Rose Bowl.If you attend any event at the Rose Bowl, please plan ahead. Wearing comfortable shoes are a MUST and familiarize yourself with the bag policy. If you attend a night event, bring a light jacket because it gets cool at night in SoCal. Take advantage of the Foothill shuttle. Do NOT attempt to Uber or Lyft because of traffic and the high premium you will be charged due to the traffic. I was shocked to see so many people wearing heels to the concert. Shocked!!! Many of them left bare feet due to their feet hurting from wearing heels. Beyoncé was the performer and anyone who is a true fan, like me, would’ve known to be in FORMATION by wearing comfortable shoes.By the way, the concert was amazing. I saw it in Dallas and it was just as good!!!",EmmJoans
30,Concert,"I visited this stadium for a concert this weekend with friends. We read on tripadvisor that the parking situation is horrible so we decided to park in the nearby neighborhood and take the 20-25 minute walk to the stadium. This save us lots of time coming out of the concert. I do wish the doors opened more than an hour before the show started to give us time to enjoy drinks and food. Since we didn't park our car at the stadium we did not tailgate before the show, which is always an option. Anther important reminder for women is to not bring a purse or clutch unless it is clear or very small. Go to the website and read the bag policy before going to your event.",BryTheVoyager
20,Not Worth The Hassle Of Getting In & Out,"Was just here last night for Jay-Z and Beyonce's On The Run II tour. I've been to the Rose Bowl many times and always vow not to go back unless it's for Beyonce because it is AWFUL trying to get to and from the venue.If you are going, I suggest parking in the lot where the shuttles are ($25 +$10/shuttle ticket) and taking the shuttle. If you park at the actual stadium it will take you over an hour just to get out.",NicMoraXO

40,Great Venue for a Great Concert!,"First of all, the Ed Sheeran show was fantastic! Far exceeded our expectations. Secondly, the venue was set up very well! I can't speak to the parking, because I heard that was a nightmare, so we took the shuttle into the event and that was awesome! Dropped us right at the gate and we were in the stadium very quickly. Next, there were bathrooms everywhere! never had to wait very long and no matter which side of the stadium we were, the restrooms were never out of sight. Food choices were plenty, and they were everywhere! Had something for everyone, except red wine..... Can you believe that nobody had red wine? Everything but red wine...... Weird!Outside of that I can't complain about a thing. We left before the last note was played, so we beat the rush back to the shuttle and got right on a bus and were out of the stadium lickety split.",alan b
20,Horrible item pick-up and intense traffic,"Ed Sheeran was amazing, no doubt. Please be mindful of their new bag policy. We were stuck in getting our checked in items for atleast 1 hour. There was definitely no system at all. There were staff in yellow shirts that did nothing at all. Also, you have to pay $10 per bag checked in. Therefore, make sure to bring clear plastic or see through bag.Concert attended around 11pm and we didn’t to our car until 1 AM.We parked in a parking structure by Colorado blvd for $15. We walked 1.2 miles to get to the event. I think this is the best way to get in and out of Rose Bowl stadium. I listed here different alternatives to get by.A) Park by the stadium and pay $40 or $60 for preferred parking. Prepare to be stuck for about 2 hours or so to get out of the event.B) Ride the shuttle bus to your parking structure. The queues were extremely long and of course, the shuttle bus would be in stuck in traffic too.C) Uber/Lyft, they put a designated place for this but this isn’t just happening. Drivers won’t even waste their time to get through the traffic for hours to pick up passengers. I saw people walked through the main streets, Colorado Blvd or Orange Grove to ride Uber or Lyft.D) Walk. This is the only choice that would save you time. We walked about 20-25 mins to our parking lot in Colorado blvd. It was safe and we saw a lot of people walking too.From this experience, I would definitely avoid this concert area unless they find a solution to lessen the traffic or be more organized.",Kris R
20,Rose Bowl parking is a nightmare,"Saw Ed Sheeran at the rose Bowl this past weekend. Excellent concert, beautiful venue but I will likely NEVER go back. It took us 2 1/2 hours to get out of the venue on a shuttle bus for the 12 minute ride back to the car. There were event staff standing around, but not even one of them bothered to direct people where to go and it took us 20 minutes just to find the shuttle line. We then clocked it - just over 2 miles of back and forth lines, making us walk all the way down to the highway and then back again. Event staff did NOTHING but stand around chatting with each other. I will NEVER go back to another concert there. Low score given is because of the complete ruination of the evening because we simply wanted to go home.",Lisa P
30,Disappointed,"My first time here in this stadium and I was disappointed . Paid $60 dollars for preferred parking which was over priced . Seats were uncomfortable . Legs were cramped due to lack of leg room, shoulder to shoulder on sides. No air flow so it was very hot . Took over an hour to get out of the parking lot, no traffic directors until the end.",Rena M
40,Excellent outdoor venue,"Went to see a concert at the Rose Bowl. It was really nice to be outside to enjoy the concert, versus those indoor closed in venues. The Rose Bowl could do better with their beer choices. There’s so many quality microbrews that you would think the Rose Bowl would do something about it. This is why I marked them down to a four star. I will definitely go back to see another concert, And let’s hope they do better with the concessions.",PilotMichael
40,Concert under the stars... after waiting in an Uber forever,"If you are in or around Old Town for an event, save yourself the trouble and walk to the stadium. It’s safe, the neighborhoods are filled with friendly folks, and security is pointing you in the right direction along the way. For walking back from the event you will find well lighted streets and more security all the way back to Old Town. If you Uber/Lift you will sit in traffic all afternoon/night.",DanFortune
10,Thieves,"Yesterday, I went to the Ed Sheeran concert, and I would have had a much better time if the people who own the stadium weren’t such thieves. $40 to park, a half mile away from the stadium. The parking was atrocious. The traffic was even worse. It took about 2 hours to get inside the parking lot. When we finally got to the entrance, we were told that we couldn’t bring our bags in. We could either check them in or take them back to the car a half mile away. Of course, it cost $10 to check in each bag. I just couldn’t believe that they waited until we got to the entrance to tell us this. I looked at my ticket and website and they said nothing about it. They should have put a big sign as we were entering to the parking lot to remind us that we couldn’t bring a bag over a certain width and length. Then it hit me why they wouldn’t do this, so that they could STEAL from us even more. There were tons of people who were angered, just like me. All these people wanted to do was have a good time at an Ed Sheeran concert, but the workers were making it nearly impossible to do so. Even though I was hungry when I attended the concert, I would not buy from their overpriced stands. They already stole enough of my hard earned money. If I ever attend another concert here, I WILL NOT park but Uber there and I will not bring a handbag. I will never give another cent to the Rose Bowl.",nicoleyoldhollywood
40,Great concert and soccer venue but parking is a nightmare,"Been here to see various concerts and soccer matches, great venue for a spectator, it is open air with no sun cover so gets warm during the daytime but nice and cool in the evenings when watching a concert.We were their last night to see Ed Sheeran and had some great seats on the floor, perfect viewing for the concert. My only complain is with the parking and more so the leaving part after the event, last night it took well over an hour to get out, we left just as the last song ended and found our car pretty easily, but then we did not move for ages, I mean I did not mind paying the $40 to park on the golf course next to the stadium but when it is dark and everyone is trying to get out there was no one managing the traffic flow for exiting, total chaos, eventually survival of the fittest kicks in and you find a gap and take it, not very safe with parents and young children walking to their cars etc and people just become so rude and just keep edging their cars forward when their is nowhere to move.I would hope that the events generate enough money to be able to put some staff into helping with the the cost flow.Next time I will be parking offsite and just walk a bit or take the bus, not only will that be less than the $40 but also I might get home a lot earlier.",parwez i

50,July 4th event,Decided we wanted to see fireworks on the Fourth of July and after doing some research thought this would be a good choice. The daytime activities were your standard radio giveaways of T shirts and hats looking at new cars and usual carnival type of games. Lots of people doing awesome tailgating parties waiting for the show to begin. Now the show before the firework was painful to watch. The Michael Jackson impersonation was the best of a bad lot of so called show before the fireworks. But then the fireworks started. I have never witnessed such a spectacular display. You thought they were over and it could not get better but then they continued to another even more awesome finish. The finale was breathtaking. I would highly recommend it to anyone close enough to go. I always though Disneyland had the best fireworks but this show was lots more and I hope to be able to see it again so etime,Elfriede M

40,Famous Stadium!,A famous sports venue in USA and known worldwide. When at maximum 100k capacity the road network in and out gets overloaded so don’t be surprised if wait more than 2 hours.

10,"The Worst Venue...Horrible Traffic Jam, Website is useless...Dont take any bags","I wish I could give the Rose Bowl Stadium it a big zero!!! This is the worst venue ever. The website is misleading and not updated with correct information. The website said small bags allowed, when we got there they made us take any and all bags back to our car and empty all items into clear plastic bags. I could not even take my baby's diaper bag in, they made me dump his items including life saving medications like his epi-pen into some cheap bag even though their website states small bags and diaper bags are allowed. The parking is overpriced and terrible. It took as over an hour to get in and over an hour to get out because there is only one way in/out and no one directs traffic when people are leaving the venue. But... there is a bunch of useless staff with no clue on the gates or map of the location directing traffic and collecting the $30.00 general parking or $60.00 preferred parking fee. The seats are terrible and crowded. I went to the T-Swift concert and I couldn't see anything and no one knew which seat they were supposed to be at because the bleachers are uncomfortable and numbered poorly. I went there for the FC Barcelona game and again paid over $300 for tickets that were useless. Its was hard to see, so everyone stood the whole time and again it was overcrowded with no clear seats since its one long metal bench people are sitting in. Unfortunately, I will be canceling my Ed Sheeran concert tickets. I cannot bear to waste another day of my life sitting in traffic trying to get in and out of the rose bowl.",Mareena M
30,Barcelona Soccer game,Beautiful historic stadium. Worth visiting for an event. Downsides to this stadium is trying to get in and out here is a huge pain.

Stadium parking for this event was $40-60,Traveling Addict

I saw GreenDay here last year and the staff were very friendly, always helpful and as I was catching an Uber after the show, signs were clearly marked as to where you had to go for pick up/drop off. It was an awesome night and everyone there made it feel a lot safer. Security was brilliant and well taken care of. I felt very safe.",Chiara K
50,Walk The Rose Bowl,"I have been to events in the Rose Bowl, but find the thing I enjoy the most about being there is walking around it.

40,Nice Recreational Site,"The contests played on the Rose Bowl field are legendary, but there is always a lot going on around the stadium. Besides golf on the two 18-hole golf courses to the north of the stadium, there is a three-mile walking course that goes around the stadium and the golf courses. There are several athletic fields to the south of the stadium along with five tennis courts.

50,Gooooo Dawgs....what a game,First of all the surrounding area including the neighborhoods and Pasadena were wonderful. Second of all the game was incredible. It was the absolute best game I have ever attended. The atmosphere was great. The weather was perfect. The fans were in to the game all the way thru 2 overtimes. The only negative experience was once inside getting around the stadium. We were stuck in a sea of people for 30 minutes and did not move a foot. Some people were frightened and others just frustrated. The area where the concessions are located needs to be widened.,DawgExplorer

40,No Swift Entry or Exit for the Taylor Swift Concert!,"Okay, so we all know that the Rose Bowl, and the surrounding neighborhood, is iconic, historic and beautiful. If you are going to a big event there (like a Taylor Swift concert), however, the best advice I can give is to go super early! It took us just over 1.5 hours to get to our seats from our Hotel, which was just 6.5 miles away!Leaving the concert wasn't exactly convenient, either. To avoid the $30 parking at the event, or $40+ in neighboring driveways, we decided to Lyft. Of course using a driving service is great if you've been drinking but it wasn't real convenient for us. It took us hours to get out of there and get back to the Hotel. The designated area for Lyft pick-up was a mess. In retrospect, I would've just paid the $30 to park there, go super early, and accept the fact that I wasn't getting back to our place anytime soon.Outside of all this, what an amazing place to see a concert!",John S
40,Great socializing,Is a great place to go and socialize put on your tennis shoes and walk around! People walk the perimeter for exercise and a bike ride. I've met women here with my weighted hula hoop or meetups. They also have a fantastic flea market! There's also a beautiful path from this location going south bound under the bridge and into South Pasadena. It's a long walk but it's very tranquil considering that we are in a suburban area.,Erudite_journey

50,Almost 4 months later,"So its been 4 months since Georgia won the Rose Bowl and I am still in disbelief that we were able to be there and win the game as we did. Unbelievable.As for the stadium and getting in and out of it the city of Pasadena seriously needs to get better at hosting this event. They are going to get a bunch of people hurt or worse having them stand around in a crowd for 3 hours after an event. In this day and age and the iconic stature of this event you would think it would be a matter of national security. Instead it is about as important to the City of Pasadena as a leaf falling in the street in October. The event planners should do everything possible to disperse as much of the crowd as possible as soon as possible after such an event. Instead they have people lined up for 3 hours, often in zig-zagged lines where there are thousands of people within and area 50 yards square....and not a security person in sight! There are event volunteers but these are high school and college aged kids without a clue of what they are doing and, after the game, ready to go home and be done with the whole thing!Security is so bad that about an hour after the game vendors start showing up and start cooking with propane cylinders in huge crowds of people standing nearby. Let that sink in for a minute and consider some of the attacks on crowds the world has seen in the last few years.I am not going to live life being afraid and refusing to go to events like the Rose Bowl....but I am also not blind to what is a catastrophe waiting to happen. The Rose Bowl, the City of Pasadena and the State of California really need to get this under control before there is an incident that gets a bunch of people hurt.",bobby H

I've been fortunate enough to go twice, and the atmosphere and pageantry are like nothing else in college football. In both cases, the weather was spectacular and the sky provided some memorable sunsets. Be prepared to do some walking -- maybe a lot of walking -- from the parking lot, and know that the stadium is old and lacks modern amenities. However, going to a Rose Bowl is something you won't forget. You can (should) prepay for parking in advance on the web site; ride share is not available for pick-up close to the stadium.In 2018, we happened to be blessed to witness one of the greatest college football games ever, between the University of Georgia and the University of Oklahoma.

We had a great experience cheering on our GA Bulldogs! My one issue was the super slow service at the concession stand. (This May be run by another company so not Rose Bowl fault but it needs improvement!) Parking was easy and well staffed and organized. Sitting in this famous stadium was an outstanding experience.

Entering the stadium was crowded but didn't take us very long to make our way through the tunnel. Our seats were good and we had a good view with the help of the large screen. Exiting the stadium was a total nightmare. There was no organization as to dividing shuttle riders and folks who had driven and parked. It took us more than 4 hours from the time was over to be herded with the masses to a line about 1 1/2 miles long to queue to the shuttles and make our way back to our hotel. Total pandemonium!

40,The stadium has seen better days and needs some serious TLC as well as some organization.....,"(it gets the benefit of the doubt b/c of its history hence four instead of three points).The good points are: it is ""The Rose Bowl""--a historic venue in a gorgeous setting. Due to the bowl shape of the stadium you can see most of what happens on the field.Well that is about it for the good.......Getting to the place is a nightmare of epic proportions. Its location in a residential area means traffic--two hours before the game--is at a standstill and those directing traffic (as I discovered pretty much around LA in general) have no clue what they are doing. Parking is easy--if you do not mind walking a mile, plus. The official parking is on an adjacent golf course but getting to/from one's car can take a while as some of the parking is as far as a mile fr/ the stadium and you had better remember exactly where you parked as, except for balloons showing the parking area number--there are few, if any landmarks. Once you have actually gotten TO the bowl it is an even worse nightmare getting into the stadium and the hired help is a total joke (when is anyone going to realize that the ""S"" in CSC event staff stands for either ""surly"" or ""stupid""). Once in line to get into the stadium it took almost an hour and that was after spending half an hour finding where to get into line due to the lunacy of their queue configuration. The people in charge of security are an absolute joke and simply want to show they have a modicum of authority so use it as often as possible. Not only are they under-staffed but also under-trained, under-equipped, and just plain ignorant, surly, & downright mean. As ushers inside the stadium they have no clue as I was accosted when I walked through the tunnel to get to my seat where a CSC staffer demanded to see my ticket and then proceeded to send me the wrong way to my seat. When I noted that was the wrong way I was told that I should go the way instructed. Upon trying to leave the exit we wanted to use was blocked and we were forced into a narrow gate only to get stuck behind a CSC event ""supervisor""---or so his cap said--who walked in front of us smoking and cursing into his cell phone.As has been mentioned there are no rails to assist you in climbing the stairs and those stairs and seating is very tight so think before you decide to leave your seat. Concession lines are extremely long and those concessions are vastly over-priced ($7 for ""luke-cold"" bottled water). The only lines longer are for the vastly inadequate restroom facilities. Note you cannot keep up w/ the game outside of the seating area b/c there are no television screens or public address announcements on the concourse area--at least none that I saw.Luckily the game was in our favor; we visited a historic venue for a historic game; and we have a picture standing in front of the neon ""Rose Bowl"" sign.My suggestion to the Rose Bowl folk is to hire a new staffing agency; make certain they are trained and friendly/polite (surprisingly those were about the only people in LA--aside fr/ drivers--who were not outgoingly friendly); update the concessions & restrooms and add some hand rails)",tencatdaddy
40,Beautiful Neon Sign,We did not attend the game we only stopped by to see what the stadium look like. We did here it's crazy on New Year's Eve night. That's when the floats are done and people are celebrating. The Rose Bowl sign is beautiful to see at night.,Char434

We drove to the stadium and didn't have any problems at all getting in or out. Was it slow? YES, but what do you expect when moving 90K people from one area? Have some patience. The stadium was awesome, I don't think there was a bad seat in the house. I also never experienced any problems with lines at any of the restrooms either. Food vendors were plentiful and there seemed to be a wide variety as well.",SmalltownGA
40,An Experience,"Attended 2018 Rose Bowl for UGA against Oklahoma. It is an old stadium, but definitely worth the trip. Hard to get in and out of the stands, but really not a bad seat in the place.

30,What a game,"We fulfilled a bucket list trip by attending the 2018 Tournament of Roses-many folks around us were doing the same. It was a bonus that the Bulldogs were playing. I was surprise to find the stadium in a residential area. Except for tradition, the Rose Bowl is a very outdated stadium that is hard to maneuver. Steps are very steep with no railings, the tunnels are very narrow, and the restrooms old. Many food vendors and drink varieties, but the rows are so tight, not many people fought to get out of their seats. But it was a glorious game!",Laura P
40,Experience of a lifetime - but know before you go!,"Let me start by saying my trip to the Rose Bowl on 1/1/18 was the trip of a LIFETIME. My team won in double O.T. (Go Dawgs!) and is headed to the National Championship game. I would not trade this experience for anything! If you get the chance – GO – but take some advice from people who have been there, done that. There are some logistical details I wish I had known before I went.The ParadeStadium parking is 5+ miles from some sections of the Rose Parade. Ideally, you would park your car where you plan to tailgate (ideally in a low-number lot like 1 or 2...) and take an Uber to the parade. We walked several miles and then finally took an LA Metro (their subway) that morning to get to our grandstands (1570 Colorado). I am so glad we saw the parade, but I won't need to do it again. We left before it ended and basically ran to an Uber to get out of there before the crowds. People that left very soon after us took over an hour to get back to the stadium parking/tailgating area. With time being short (8 AM parade and 2 PM kickoff) that cut way into tailgating time. Sit at the start of the parade (the end of the route closest to Rose Bowl Stadium) and once it's about 70% over -- get out of there (if you care at all about getting back to your tailgate!). Clearly I like tailgating!Back to the tailgating...Some of the lots are REALLY FAR (mile+) from the stadium. Lots 6, 7, etc. are a good hike so don't plan to park in 7 and carry your stuff to someone's set up in lot 2... unless you have a large wheeled cart!If you have people trying to find you, take some sort of very obvious flag or balloon or similar object to fly really high in the sky. It is almost impossible otherwise because there aren't a ton of landmarks once you get out onto the golf course (where the parking and tailgating occurs). There is a company called Tailgate Concierge which we used in order to have everything set up for us (food, booze, TV, tent, chairs, etc.) since we came across the country and didn’t have all our stuff. Worth looking into if you have a large enough group!Our kickoff was at 2 PM. We headed in at 12:40 and barely made it. There are 4 gates, each with only 7-8 security lines. It takes FOREVER. Once it finally started to move, it seemed ok, but we felt like corralled cows at one point – stuffed in the queues and not moving. I have some claustrophobia but I did ok. Mainly because you are outside (just look up at all that space above you!) and surrounded by mostly your own people. If you go in without a bag AT ALL, you can go in the shorter lines. I would have put my phone in one pocket, cash and ID in another, and my ticket on a lanyard around my neck had I known that. But we made it in, and got to our seats - eventually. The seating numbers do NOT make sense, no one who works there seems to know where seat numbers start and end, and they really aren’t much help. Very nice, but not helpful! We walked up and down to the top row about 4 times before we landed in our seats. Try to scope out a map and figure out which row you will walk up or down ahead of time. I wish we had! Especially once people are sitting on the seat numbers and the sections aren’t labeled very well, it is tricky.The TunnelsThe word “tunnel” freaks me out (see claustrophobia above!) but these are just openings into the stadium, like EVERY OTHER stadium I have ever been in, that lead you from concessions to inside the bowl shape and to the seats. Tunnel is a misnomer. We also had no trouble getting to our seats from the tunnels – it was the entry gates that caused the problem. Tunnel 27 was more like an open air hallway and then 8-9 steps up to the seats where the ushers stand to (try to) guide you.ConcessionsMaybe there aren’t enough concessions as others have said, but maybe it was just because this was the ROSE BOWL and no one cares about paying for a $14 beer after they have bought a ticket, a cross country flight, a hotel room, and paid whatever other expenses. But the lines were long, and some moved faster than others. Your best bets are the domestic beer lines where you get a 24 oz. bomber in a can (less spilling!) for $14. Make some friends in the line and try to listen for cheers so you can keep up with the game. I had been told “if you go out for a beer you may miss a whole quarter” and that is not true. Perhaps before the renovations from 2013-2017, but not anymore. You may miss a possession but not a quarter. The pizza is good too!TIPS:- Most of the areas where you walk are dirt so don't wear new shoes.- It is a LOT of walking - think Disney-amounts of walking. I wish I had worn my running shoes despite them not being as cute!- It gets COLD when the sun goes down. You are in the mountains.",Reagmich
50,Rose Bowl 2018,"Great historical venue, small tunnels to enter and exit the game stadium. Wonderful staff to make sure you are seated properly. Take you ticket each time you exit the viewing area to visit concessions or restroom. It would be a good idea to purchase a ticket lanyard. Not enough food, ran out before end of game & limited tv's for viewing while waiting for food.If you are traveling with a ADA person you will need to look for ADS entrance signs, not clearly visible.",Shenall B
20,An infrastructure nightmare.,"Typical of ""venerable"" stadiums, the Rose Bowl has terrible access. There is a good amount of parking available but, due to limited roadways, it is difficult to get to. The stadium is old and does not have such niceties as handrails. The seating is the worst aluminum bench seating I have ever had the misery to sit upon. The benches have two gaps in them to give you an especially painful sitting experience. The only good thing about the stadium is that, being a bowl, it does have good sight lines.",ransom007
50,yes there are FLAWS but come on it's THE ROSE BOWL,"Here is the downside....parking can be horrific, it's crowded, the stadium is old and antiquated so bathroom breaks and food runs take a while.Here is the positive....its a bucket list type attendance, the show including a stealth fly over is awesome, the game a BCS semi final was probably the best college football game in 2017! First OT game in Rose Bowl history, most points scored, first meeting between OU and UGA.The experience was unbelievable!!Here is my tip: take Public transport to Pasadena and walk the 1.7 miles to the stadium and be part of history.",ChrisJohnson97
10,Beautiful Rose Bowl needs an update,"Watched the best college football game ever. Followed by the worst experience in getting out of the stadium and grounds. 50,000 people came by buses provided by the city of Pasadena. After the game, in the dark, with staff that had no clue how to move 50,000 people to awaiting buses almost ruined the event. It was dark and many older people were put in a dangerous situation, being told to keep walking to some unknown spot to find the end of the line. This walk in the dark took hours, no clue how far we walked. It was exhausting.The stadium is under-equipped with restrooms and the stadium steps are very difficult for those not in hiking shape.. Time for a make-over. Keep the charm and make it worthy of the game itself.The unexpected benefit was the respect and help the Oklahoma and Georgia fans showed each other after they game trying to help each other out of this march through concentration wire fences.",Dan B
40,Awesome Venue! Horrible shuttle experience.,"First the good... This stadium is set in a beautiful location and having watched the Rose Bowl for over 40 years it was great to travel out and watch my Dawgs!The bad, both getting in and getting out was extremely disorganized. We wanted to take a shuttle up from the parade. We were told that the shuttles would depart at 10:00, when we lined up there was supposed to be one line that zig zagged through barriers however they were not qued properly. At 10:15 the first shuttle had not even loaded so we decided to walk the nearly 2 miles to the stadium. After the game was even worse, there was no clear markings where the shuttles were picking up, again we tried to find it and couldn't so we walked the two miles back to our car. It appeared to me that they were totally unprepared for the amount of people that were there.",Kelly Joyce Sr

10,100 years of experience????,"Besides the horrible traffic, the service staff there were ignorant of what and where things were in the facility, it seemed like they were never training. We asked 20+ people in uniforms where the Will Call office was and either they did not know or looked at us with a blank stare and did not speak. They were somewhat organized in getting you into the parking areas, but when the game was over it was a mad house, with nobody directing traffic to smooth out the flow of 20,000 cars. This was THE WORST organized event I have ever attended. I have been to many events just as large where the people wanted to help the attendees. The hospitality (extra charge) area was just as unorganized as everywhere else on property. They missed opportunities to sell more food and drinks because they did not have any organization or work flow to serve the customers. The same person who took the order, took the money, and went to get the items you bought. Instead of having order takers and some expediter delivering the order to the counter. Why was there only 2-3 people at each booth and it seemed like one of the three was standing in the back watching??? The people traffic flow was sooooo congested, with choke points that were less than 6 feet wide as you passed the ""B"" gate, you had 1,000's of people passing through this 6' wide spot along with electric carts that had to move people out of the way or pinch them into the fence and rock wall to get through. The people flow to get into the stadium was much better, even with the security screening. The ADA access was non-existent, the electric carts were not to help ADA movement they were full of dignitaries even though the cars had the wheelchair symbol on them. Cell phone service was very spotty, if there was any at all. I was at the Super Bowl in Houston and the organizers brought in extra WiFi and Cell tower boosters through out the area to make sure everyone had service and WiFi access. I would NEVER go back to the Rose Bowl Stadium again, this was such a terrible experience. Had to walk out of the area (and walking was way faster than driving) for 2 miles to get to the ride share pick up spot. The Rose Bowl METRO Shuttle service line was a never ending MOSH PIT of 30,000 people and not well organized, The shuttles took you to Memorial Park to drop you off, then you would have to walk another 1/2 mile or so to the METRO Gold Line or a parking facility. Would some one please teach these organizers how to run an event better than this.",Konrad D
10,Rose Bowl - Disappointing!,"If your team plays in the Rose Bowl, you want to support your team so you'll choose to go. It's a logistical nightmare! Infrastructure doesn't exist to support getting into the stadium, moving to your seat, or driving to pre-paid parking. You can stand in line for a long time to get food and learn that in that line you can ONLY get drinks! It took as much time to get to the game and to our seats that the game itself. In addition, the game announcer made error after error in crediting tackles to players on the wrong team. The digital scoreboard for 2 quarters inaccurately represented the score. The digital replay of a scoring drive was so delayed that they played it on the big screen just as the opposing team was starting their offensive possession (well after the media break and kick-off after the score.Upside: The stadium is in a beautiful setting of the mountains and the fly-over by the air force was spectacular!Overall, the granddaddy bowl of them all is hype and a flop-very poor user experience!! Be prepared to exercise patience when your team plays here! Hope management figures out how to do it right - try modeling after AT&T stadium in Dallas.",Kim P
40,Rose bowl,The event staff were get friendly and the pregame transportation was excellent. The event was will organized and I felt safe. The only negative was that the post game transportation was extremely disorganized!!! We had to walk in a loosely organized extremely long line for nearly two hours to get on a shuttle. People with children in disabilities and the elderly suffered. There really really should have been a consideration for the fact that this people could not queue and walk for that distance.,J K
10,Good game....horrible crowd control,"Considering the Rose Bowl is very old they have no idea how to manage an event. Almost impossible to access. The bowl site recommends using the metro, over a mile from the stadium without a sign anywhere telling people from out of town where the stadium is.Getting there is a piece of cake compared to getting back....3-1/2 hours in a line to get a shuttle, and even the shuttle drivers don’t know where the shuttle is going .....it stops in the middle of an office complex.....nothing open in the area....and not a policeman or security guard in site.If your team gets in the Rose Bowl you are going to go BUT pay whatever the price is for parking at the stadium, plan on being in the parking lot at least 5 hours before and after the game.It is said that New Orleans is the best managed city in the Caribbean.....even New Orleans cant manage to mismanage a major event this badly. In this day and age getting crowds away from venues is a major safety concern. The after event crowd management at the rose bowl is a catastrophe waiting to happen.",bobby H
30,Don't count on shuttle for leaving game! Need back up plan!,"Rose Bowl Game. Rode over on shuttle. No problem. Line around the 2 corners of block and then queue. But it moved. After the game... and award presentation... could not find end of line... walked 1/4 around stadium in ""line"" to see massive queue ahead of us. So standing properly for 25 minutes we were led to parking lot where the ""end"" could not be found. We gave up! I think people are still in line there! Couldn't get cell reception, so followed a crowd to neighborhood with cell reception and uber. Crowded, long walk. Cell connection at Orange Grove Blvd & Rosemont. Finally success connecting with Uber at Lincoln & Orange Grove Blvd. Would have been a shorter way to that intersection. Take a printed map if you are going to rely on cell service. Find out blocked roads first and where uber can get to before you go to stadium! Surprised leaving was so miserable with venue with such history. Let me know if this is helpful.",D D

Plus, where else can you see mountains while watching a football game in 70 degree weather on New Years Day! #BoomerSoonerAlways",Hayley Rose
20,"Football game great, parking ridiculous","We were here for the rose bowl game. For what they make in parking, the least they could do is pay people to direct traffic after the game as well.

50,"The most iconic and beautiful college football stadium anywhere. Truly The ""Grandaddy"" of them all.","I have attended the Rose Parade and Rose Bowl Game since I was a child beginning in 1966 for the game. Located in a beautiful residential area, unlike many stadiums relegated to industrial or tougher neighborhoods, the feeling is such a throwback except it is real and alive today! UCLA fans really have it made coming here to tailgate in the gorgeous surroundings, and there is no better experience than the New Years Day tradition of attending the Rose Parade live, then walking through the beautiful areas, past historic houses, and down to the parklike grounds leading to the Bowl for the very first New Years Day Bowl game, and still the best of them all! .

50,Coldplay concert!,"We took the shuttle from Pasadena-super efficient-well worth it, hassle free. We also came early to avoid the rush. We hung out where they had food vendors outside or Rose Bowl. It was ok, food options weak but hey it’s a concert. Rose Bowl great place for a concert, highly recommend. They are so organized and manage crowds well. Sound was great although my husband said it was not loud enough. We suspect it’s due to noice ordinances since Rose Bowl in residential area. Security very good with metal detectors and police presence-we felt very safe. Very historic place to see concert-if you get the chance go. Use the shuttle, come early and enjoy!",car0lynak
50,Bucket List: Rose Bowl-check,"I’ve seen the rose Bowl thousands of times on TV and when my family planned a trip to L.A. I checked UCLA’s football schedule and was happy that they were home the same Saturday we were in town. I have no affiliation to the school, but as an avid sports fan the Rose Bowl is as famous as a place you can visit. Right up there with old yankee stadium, Fenway, Wrigley and all the other throw backs, the Rose Bowl did not disappoint. We got there early, parked north of the stadium and really took in the college football atmosphere. We dreaded the potential nightmare of leaving and the traffic, but the route took us quickly right back to the freeway and we were on our way. What a great way to spend a Saturday. We will be back.",Jim H

40,Coldplay,"Getting to the Rose Bowl was easy enough as we had left with plenty of time as they advised in their email only to arrive for the concert 3 hours early and with nothing to do.Parking cost $40 however I am not sure if this price changes depending on the event. Good side of this was that we were only 5 mins walk away from the stadium.You are only allowed to take in a see through bag for security reasons and small handbags are not allowed, you would have to check these in and i am not sure what the charge is for this.Food/drink is pricey - we spent $30 on one meal and 2 drinks.Our seats did not have back support and they say you can bring in cushions but you will still be numb by the end of the night.The concert itself was great with lots of pyrotechnics, sound quality was good too.Getting out of the car park was awful and while we were only travelling back to Hollywood, we didn't get in til after 2am. It took us over 2 hours to get out of the car park. We would've used public transport but was not aware of any.",Bexxcx

Also, don't miss the monthly Rose Bowl Flea Market, held the first Sunday of each month. Finally, walking around the Bowl is a fun people-watching activity, and you will cover just over three miles.",JDinLA
40,Historic and Fun Place for a Football Game,"Have been to the Rose Bowl on numerous occasions for UCLA Football in the last 3 seasons. The Rose Bowl, although it is old and not the greatest stadium, is still a very nice venue and its sight lines are much better than the LA Memorial Coliseum where it seems like no matter where you sit, you are a long way from the action. The Rose Bowl has been incrementally improved over the years and still has some way to go, but unless you are on the hard concrete seats in the end zone, it can be a nice experience. It's been the site for many historic sports events like the annual Tournament of Roses Bowl game, Olympic events, World Cup Soccer championships and many other concerts and important events. It's a place that has history and atmosphere. One important thing is not park at the Rose Bowl. When it is available, take Metro Gold Line to Pasadena and take the Bus to the Stadium.",geotech522
30,Maddening Venue,"For its size (it can seat 100,000), its fame and constant usage for sports and rock concerts, attending the Rose Bowl is an ordeal, like entering a one-street town dealing with an unexpected flood of tourists. Incongruously nestled in a residential neighborhood of narrow streets and inexplicably lacking adequate parking lots, it is a nearly hour-long process (that costs $40--by far the highest parking rates in Los Angeles almost by double), which includes a long hike from neighboring golf course grounds to the stadium. The event staff is earnest but sketchy; it's common to be told two or three different directions to parking and seats, seats which must be said are narrow and cramped. That said, ample entry points (even with normal security) are quicker than normal, the food vending is varied, tasty, and quick, but leaving the venue is a bigger nightmare than arriving. In between the misery the show goes on, and some of the greatest sports and rock shows have taken place there. Plan ahead!",Marc M
30,Concert,Came for a concert and my goodness they are strict here with women's bags/purses. When they say a bag of 6inches or smaller they mean it. They will make you get out of line to go check ur bag in for a fee and waiting for them to find ur numbered bag is practically an hour wait! Ridiculous! Everything is overpriced as expected for a venue but the venue itself is nice for a concert. Basically you pay for a ticket but you can sit wherever they don't check and it's far to chaotic to keep track of it all. Literally a guy told me to sit wherever I wanted. Venue parking overpriced take a shuttle for cheaper price or park in residential and walk it. Nice venue!,theyayaborjon
40,"Legendary, but not a great stadium","This is one of the most famous and important stadiums in all of sports. That being said, Its a lousy old bowl design that was built almost a 100 years ago. I loved the experience and being there, but the stadium itself is lackluster. Its over a mile walk from the parking lot (on a golf course). A must see experience for sure, but you might leave slightly disappointed. There is no upper deck, which might make finding seats a struggle for some. September game was brutally hot if you werent in the shade.",Randell Carlton Green
50,Great classic venue to see a game!,"We went to the UCLA/Texas A&M game, and pre-purchased a golf course parking spot (very difficult to find though). This area is where most of the people tailgate, and can be a long walk to the stadium. We sat in the endzone, but didn't miss the game because when the ball was in the other zone the large screens kept you in the game.",DebStr2016
20,The UCLA/Texas A&M Football Game,"I was very surprised and disappointed in the Rose Bowl. It is a very old and out dated facility. The restrooms are mostly on the ground level. The PA system is attorcious. I could not understand anything that the announcer said during the game. The access tunnel system is not adequate for the number of people attending the game. Maybe I was expecting too much from all the television hype that surrounds the Rose Bowl, or maybe The Rose Bowl bowl game is more impressive.",Ronald R

40,UCLA Football.. but very horrible parking,"My family and I attended a UCLA football game this labor day weekend. Let just start off by saying that the parking was horrible. Yes, there is people guiding you were to go, however the parking is on grass!! It's like a big park, and when the game finished, it was an extreme chaos trying to get out. No help from people who work there, good luck finding the exit. Inside the stadium was really nice. It's just as you would expect it. We sat in the general seating area and got some nice descent seats. It was a good game although UCLA got smoked thru out the whole game, but that's for another story. People that sell lemonade are nice, we got 2 lemonades from them each at $7 a pop, they come in nice size cups, just estimating about 32 oz. The stadium was also offering zip lock bags to put your stuff in since they weren't allowing to bring in big bags. However the stadium was nice, still horrible parking and at $30 bucks, it was expensive.",Fausto A
30,football stadium bucketlist,"Attended a college football game here. Always dreamed of going to the Rose Bowl, but the stadium itself is old, crowded, and rather run down. You literally have to leave the stadium to go to the bathrooms or concessions. And don't expect the big Jumbotron monitors. They only had one smaller screen located on one end of the stadium and I never did find the play clock. And they only showed replays when it was beneficial to UCLA. The UCLA fans were loud and mouthy, not very welcoming but I did appreciate their support for their team. The stadium is located in a very beautiful residential neighborhood, and is a little difficult to get in/out of due to traffic. But they do provide a nice shuttle system to/from the Parsons Bldg nearby, which I would definitely recommend unless you want to park within painted stripes on a nearby golf course. My opinion is to go take your picture in front of the sign and skip the game experience!",Lorine G
40,The Rose Bowl: a Pasadena icon,"Depending upon what you want to see: UCLA football, soccer, rock concerts by top performers, and other special events, it all happens at the Rose Bowl. The Rose Bowl has become a major economic force in Pasadena after many years of sitting idle between New Year's games. The one downside is the disruption it causes in an otherwise quiet neighborhood due to noise and traffic. We live in that neighborhood, but far enough removed to not be bothered. In addition to events inside the Bowl, there are huge swap meets on the second Sunday of each month on the parking lots, and kids' soccer games on adjacent lawn areas every weekend. Adjacent are an excellent golf course, an aquatic center and the KidSpace museum, something for the whole family.",Joseph H
30,Disappointed with the stadium,"Attended Metallica concert on July 29th here and came away disappointed with the experience. Firstly, the location of the Rose Bowl is a major put-off. As someone that attends sports events and concerts regularly in the Bay Area, I expect stadiums with huge capacity to be easily accessible to the public via public transportation and in areas that are welcoming to people who wish to arrive on foot. The Rose Bowl seems to be hidden in a forest and I would hate to walk in this area at night. I was hoping to take public transportation and walk the last mile to the stadium but decided to instead drive to the Parsons parking lot which charges $16 and take the $5 roundtrip shuttle which in my view turned out to be one of the best decisions I have ever made. The shuttle dropped me off right in front of Gate B. The stadium seems like a Greek ruin. That's understandable since it's quite old. All along I kept wondering how it managed to host world class events. The restrooms would make even Greyhound station restrooms look like the loos in a 5 star hotel. And what's up with that mist being sprayed on people entering and exiting the restrooms? All it did was make the floor wet and even more unhygenic to trod on. The food stalls had enough variety in their menu but as expected they were pricey. A bowl of Chicken Teriyaki and a lemonade set me back $20. As for the seating, only the sideline sections have back rests. The rest of the seats are bleachers and as hard as metal can be. I paid $60 for my last row endzone bleacher seat and it was covered with stains that had not even fully dried, most likely that of BBQ sauce. I had to adjust with my neighbor but in the end decided to place my ticket print out on the seat and sit on top of it. And once the concert started everyone including me was anyway standing so it didn't matter in the end. But there is such a thing called stadium maintenance and for the price that I paid for my ticket, I expect a seat that I can sit on. The concert itself was good, the stadium packed to the brim and Metallica did their best but I was in no mood to stay till the end of the concert and decided to leave early to catch the shuttle back to Parsons lot. Based on my previous stadium experiences at various NFL/NBA/MLB/MLS/NHL arenas/stadiums in the USA, which has several great modern stadiums in my view, I would rate this as the worst stadium I have been to and don't intend to ever set my foot in again. It may be suitable for college athletics, but it beats me how it has managed to hold world class sports events. Sometimes the heritage associated with something can carry it farther than what it deserves.",Arun Goud A
20,Pure chaos - at least for a concert,"We saw Metallica here and wow... what a nightmare. The band was fantastic but this place is pure chaos. The parking. No words. We paid $60 for preferred parking only to have no direction to the correct lot. When we got to the lot, they didn't even have straight lines or direction how to park. We almost thought they were were stack parking. It was insane. Luckily, we left early and missed the nightmare of getting out. I cannot imagine. Inside, the security lines did move fast, so that was nice. There were a lot of vendors and the bathrooms were big and well located, so no huge lines for food drinks or restrooms - bonus. This place is OLD and the seats are small and close together, so be prepared. This was fine, though - people around us were cool. But it was bad later as people got more and more wasted. LOTS of super drunk people here. What is this place like for a football game? I can't even imagine.",S Logan
20,Iconic Stadium Needs Major Renovations,"Attended USC Penn State Rose Bowl. Great game but the Stadium itself needs major renovations.Seating needs steeper pitch -- my view of field was constantly blocked by people walking in the aisles in front of me. My section had hard metal bleacher seating, so no back rests and no clearly defined seat.Video board is sub-standard compared to NFL stadiums and many college football stadiums. Parking and shuttles from downtown Pasadena were a nightmare.Concessions were disappointing and restrooms need updating.Overall, a very disappointing experience for a $500 ticket :(",Wesley C
40,Fun family venue,"Great place for ball games, picnics, and special events. The only downside is the parking. All flat parking - easy to get lost and may be a long walk to the stadium.

Translation some very rich folks live here in some mighty old/ nice homes of that periodIt is also home of the Rose Bowl. Where UCLA plays some of its games. It is also home to a very good swap meet. That is in itself is well worth the time to do a Recon.Just beware that it is a huge area. So it helps that you wear comfortable shoes and are in reasonable shape.,David L
50,Make a vacation of it!,"I've read numerous negative reviews about seeing concerts at the Rose Bowl, mostly pertaining to the traffic getting into and out of the stadium. All of this is true and I shared similar frustrations the first time I went to a concert at the Rose Bowl.Having learned from her previous experience, we decided to make a vacation out of our journey to the Rose Bowl to see U2. We left LA at noon and checked into our hotel in downtown Pasadena. We left our car at the hotel, and had an early dinner and drinks at Sushi Roku. Nearly everyone in the restaurant was headed to the concert, which made the vibe even more fun.After a delicious meal and some sake, we walked into the venue (approximately 30 minute walk), arriving early enough to avoid the crowds.We followed the instructions provided by the Rose Bowl regarding the size of bags allowed into the venue, and this made the process of going through security quick and efficient.Once inside, we had time to relax and have some drinks, and secure a good place to watch the concert. U2 was fantastic, the sound was great, and the energy of the crowd helped enhance the show.When the show ended, we knew we had a journey ahead to get out of the stadium. Instead of rushing, we went to the bathroom, got some food, and then began the hike up the hill back to downtown Pasadena. We were showered and in bed at our hotel before the rest of our friends were able to get their cars out of the Rose Bowl parking lot.If you have the time and ability to make the concert a vacation, the trip to the Rose Bowl can be fun and enjoyable.Even if you can't stay over at a hotel, I recommend parking your car in downtown Pasadena, and walking to and from the venue. It's a nice walk and will save you time and frustration.",MyTravelTalesColette
20,U2 concert here was an absolute mess,"We have been here before for UCLA football games and expected things to be the same. We got there early to wait in line, they had announcements about the bag policy (which was different there than what they said online) and what gates to enter once you got into the stadium for floor access, but never once mentioned that there was one entrance gate for all of floor access. We stood in line, in the hot sun for over an hour, asked an official security person if we were in the right line, I showed her the ticket and she said yes. Then we go through security, pass and get to the gate who tells us this is wrong. They could not even help us on what gate we had to go to, how to get out of the security area etc. I asked for a security manager who finally let us out. We walked around the entire half of the stadium to find an insane line of people waiting for the floor gates. It wound around like a Disneyland line for over 45 minutes and we got into the venue with 5 min to spare to watch the opening act. Halfway back. NOT HAPPY!! The lack of knowledge of security cost us big time and that is not how we wanted to watch U2.The concert was great there. The venue was nice as it is for football games. Weather was nice.Then we got to leave and it was insane. The line for the buses' was random, people kept crowding in and after 30 min, we didn't move. We waited another 30 min and it moved but not enough to have us feel confident we would be out of there anytime soon. So we tried the lyft/uber service which was a mess as well due to streets being closed, annoyed drivers (I would be too), security telling the drivers different things, it was a mess. Low and behold we got back to our hotel 5 min away two hours later. It was nuts.We will never return to the Rose Bowl for a concert. UCLA football game yes, but never for a concert. Not worth the hassle.",lovept
40,Iconic stadium,"Wonderful experience to watch a game or a concert at the Rose Bowl. It seats more than 90.000 people, even more on concerts.

The things for sale, some new, some not so new and the antiques are beautiful and the variety of things is out of this world.For a game, this place is wonderful. I've been for regular UCLA football games and for the ""Grand Daddy of Them All"", the Rose Bowl Game on New Years Day.

First night we walked but you have to go up before coming in old Pasadena. For me Rose Bowl stadium is great but public transportation terrible",yvonne150556
20,"Frequent loop runner, first time concert-goer","I have trained for four LA Marathons by using the Rose Bowl loop. It is mostly good for that. The path is wide, parking is ample, and the 5k length is just right. However, they do not do an adequate job of notifying the public about closures. Most events are listed on their website, but they don't tell you the status of the loop. I have gone there on days when no event was posted and the loop was closed. I had also assumed for a long time that the loop was closed for the flea markets because there is paid parking available, but then found out the loop was open and most of the parking around the loop was free. I also ran the inaugural Pasadena Half-Marathon here, and, aside from the rain, that was mostly a good experience. The parking took forever, but I thought it was okay given all of the road closures. I attended the U2 concert here Sunday, and it was my first and last concert at the Rose Bowl. I paid an extra $40 for parking, and it was a disaster. I spent about an hour online trying to find which of the entrances were open, and could find no information anywhere. I ended up taking my usual way north on Orange Grove to Rosemont, only to see a big sign that said Rosemont was for ride-share only, and I needed to go straight. The traffic was backed up so bad, I couldn't get in the right lane, so I stayed in the left and asked a traffic cop where to go. She told me to make a left at the next light, which was nice because there were no signs to tell me that. There was also extreme gridlock at Walnut because there were no traffic cops. The Orange Grove traffic was backed up to California. I could have probably avoided that by taking Fair Oaks if I knew I couldn't turn on Rosemont. It took me an hour and a half to drive the 7 miles from my house to the Rose Bowl. Once inside, finding my seat wasn't hard, but the stadium is almost all seats and few aisles, which would make an evacuation a disaster. This and the lack of security made me a little nervous, even before the Ariana Grande bombing. You had to pass through a metal detector and a permanent fence to get in, but I saw very few security guards, and there were a lot of people smoking in the stadium, and even more were drinking alcohol. The seats were designed for short and skinny people. I am 6 feet tall, and I had to sit hunched over because there was no room for my knees and the top of the seat poked me in the back when I leaned back. We also had to step on the feet of the people sitting in the first 25 seats in our row to get to our seats. The view was fabulous, though, even from the nose bleed section. There were no speakers blocking the view like at Staples Center. Leaving the stadium was even worse than getting there. We sat for over an hour in the golf course without moving. There were two lines from our section merging into the main exit lane at first, then people started to drive around the lines and there were at least three other lines created, plus the main lane became four lanes that all had to merge to exit. There was no one on the golf course directing traffic. They apparently had closed our exit for a long time, because we went from being completely stopped, to everyone leaving at once. The concert let out at 10:50 and we got home at 1:00am. My other issue with the Rose Bowl is they do business with Ticketmaster. I was lucky enough to have had the day off work when tickets went on sale. All of the tickets for the Saturday show were sold to scalpers the second they went on sale. I tried for an hour on two computers to get tickets, but I could not get a single one. But almost every seat was available for resale for hundreds of dollars more than the face value. I was able to get a ticket for Sunday's show, but only in the higher price ranges. Also, t-shirts at the concert were being sold for $40, despite the exact same t-shirts being sold on the street for $10. Other than that, the Rose Bowl is a lovely and iconic place to visit. There are a lot of good events there. I just wouldn't recommend it for concerts or football games.",Brbnkseaj
40,"The Lumineers, U2 & the Rosebowl","So awesome. But boy was it hot on 5.21.17. Paid $60 preferred parking and it was well worth it. Parked on grass lawn, tailgate in the shade behind our car. Really good vibe.Venue is big. Only purchased a ""large"" bottle of water once inside for $7. It was really a medium size.Seats are close, but most football stadiums are these days. Great to be under the open sky for this concert since there was so much ""smoke"" floating around.Getting back to the highway was confusing with all the baricades, I missed the freeway entrance and had to go west to go east back to the hotel.All in all, fun.",HikingHonu
40,Tight squeeze but stadium is impressive,"We caught the second show by U2 on Sunday night. The concert experience was marvelous with the band putting on a great show (although I could have done without the preaching and liberal clichés). As for the venue itself, it is very impressive. But everybody is packed in together like sardines . . . indeed the space for each individual is quite small and quite different from other venues such as The Hollywood Bowl. It is also best to bring your own drinks and you are permitted to bring two medium-size bottles of water in a clear bag. This certainly beats paying eight dollars for lemonade. Otherwise, the facilities are good including the bathrooms being clean and well-maintained. Getting through security was pretty efficient. So all in all, no complaints and this is still a great place to catch a concert.",vincemc
20,U2 at the Rose Bowl,"We saw U2 this past weekend at the Rose Bowl. As always, U2 rocked and out on a great show. However, the Rose Bowl is the worst place to go see a concert. The parking system they have is a nightmare. Getting in is a big hassle, but getting out of the bowl has to be the worst. If you wait for the shuttle to take you to your parking structure(2.2 miles away), you'll wait over 1 hour for the shuttle. We decided to walk from the Rose Bowl to Old Town Pasadena and it only took us about 30 minutes to walk up the hill with thousands of other people who refused to wait almost 2 hour to take the shuttle. I'll never go back to the Rose Bowl again.",Melvin Udall
30,Packed in like sardines,"It's quite an experience to watch U2 together with 60000 other fans. But the seats at this venue are aluminum benches with no back supports so very uncomfortable. Also the seats are not designed for the average size American anymore so your neighbor is sitting pretty much on top of you. Stood most of the the concert. Also it would be nice if the staff knew where the Uber pick up parking lot is, the first 6 we asked had no clue.",radar60
40,U2,"Awesome concert, great seats and the sound quality was exceptional given it was an arena setting. Get to the concert people.",kurtm559
10,"Horrible, Disorgnized Parking Ruins a Joyful Experience","This was my first and last visit to the Rose Bowl. We went to see U2 on 5/21/17. We prepaid $40 for parking and arrived at 2:30, per the Rose Bowl's suggestion to avoid parking issues. At this point, all was well. The parking staff were efficient in directing us to a parking area on the golf course. We found a shady spot to have a little picnic. A friendly fellow picnicker shared a few worthwhile tips about the venue: 1. If you don't take a purse, you can use the express line. 2. Pay close attention to where you park because nothing is labeled and everything looks the same in the dark. He was spot on on both accounts. We avoided a long snake-like line by going through the express lane. After the concert, it seemed like everyone was wandering around trying to figure out where in the world they parked. Luckily, I took his advice and had oriented myself using the big Honda sign on top of the stadium. You HAVE to do this, otherwise it's so easy to find yourself in the wrong parking area. There is no signage to help--just one big unlit balloon for each section--but each section is huge!Anyway, U2 was awesome. The seating was very uncomfortable bench style, designed in an era before we collectively expanded our waistlines--so a very tight squeeze. But the concert overshadowed this discomfort.What happened after the concert pretty much ruined the experience for me. There is no rhyme or reason for exiting the various sections of the golf course. Those efficient parking attendants? Gone. People were trying to figure out exit routes--traversing over a golf course, hills and all. We became stuck in a gridlock that lasted over an hour. I was starting to feel claustrophobic--with thoughts of ""Uh oh...I should have used the restroom."" After an hour at a standstill (with no way to get out of it!), our line started inching. I wondered if we were lemmings, following someone who totally didn't know what to do. Fortunately, we got to a place where we could cross over to another parking area (they are all walled off from each other with invisible--in the dark--mesh fencing), and my husband grabbed the opportunity. Over an hour after getting in our car, we finally could exit.I can't believe that SOMEONE at the Rose Bowl never had the thought of, ""We should add lighting, or exit arrows, or designated lanes, or something to help people exit."" After all, everyone pretty much agrees that exiting is a nightmare. All I can think is that the Rose Bowl just doesn't care enough to actually think of a solution, or they think the solution would be too expensive.I guess they don't have to care about customer satisfaction because people will always want to go to games and concerts. But not me. I'm ""one and done"" with this venue.To me, it's ridiculous that this very popular venue would not have figured out exit flow. That whole wonderful ""after concert"" vibe was gone. And I'm still mad, the next day.",gore1111jp
40,"Still a good stadium, but needs some help","Haven't been here in a few years. This is still such a nice location for a stadium, and there is a lot of history here. However, starting to show some age. Overall a great experience, the food selections are great. However, the seats could use an upgrade, and could use to have more legroom. Stadiums would be better to go comfort over seeing how many sardines you can pack in a can. Also, entrances need to be upgraded to make for a smoother entry. Given the capacity, the stadium entrances are not sufficient in size or number to handle entrance easily. However, all things considered, it's still a good venue",Courtney B
30,Not my favorite venue!,"First visit for a concert (which was fab!!)....I was shocked at the lack of organization and transportation options to the venue. Lines to enter the stadium were AMAZINGLY long and unorganized. No ropes or staff to keep order and stop cutting and the like. Security was thorough which was great. No wifi or much cell service inside. The lack of wifi meant cash was the only accepted method of payment. Pricing for drinks and food was higher than Yankee Stadium! $14 drinks. $20 for a brat and fries. Bathrooms old, not serviced during event and not enough as lines were long. The seats (the location was front row and outstanding) were rusted and ancient. No padding, squished together and no cup holder. Fortunately we did not sit, but those there for a more seated event, beware. No taxi/cab stand after...only a disorganized Uber/Lyft area on the grass. I was shocked.",Gooselee
10,Rose bowl and Uber suck,"Going to U2 was awesome. Getting there sucked. One and half hours to get to front gate after uber dropped us 1.5 miles away. Leaving even worse. Took 2.5 hours to get out and even find an Uber. For some reason Uber drivers don't know the access routes to the stadium. We never found any Uber, phone died they were 4 miles out to walk. Finally found a cab. Granted the stadium blocks almost everything off making it a nightmare for everyone. I'll never go to another event there againThe rose bowl concessions were simply poor. I mean really, a mixed drink in a box and only three to pick from? Just a generally crappy venue with crappy service and horrible access in and out. Don't go there.U2 were fantastic. Otherwise the whole thing would have been an entire waste!",Kary C
20,"Horrible layout, and organization for events!!!","My boyfriend and I read the reviews on here before we went, but it did not help much! The only thing we did do correctly, was to book a hotel for after our concert, so we wouldn't have to drive home (hour drive South to OC). The closest hotel we could get was 10 miles away in San Gabriel, which was not too bad.First off, for those who don't know the Rose Bowl is surrounded by a residential community (bad planning #1). So, when events happen, they close a lot of these roads down for what ever events. (*I feel sorry for the people who bought these gorgeous, and expensive home, and have to stay inside, as traffic goes down their streets).As per the suggestion of many, we did not drive, or do the shuttle from Parsons, as we heard, after the concert, it was long lines to get the shuttle to go back to Parsons. So, like many, we did Uber as our mode of transportation. It was great, as we did not know have to worry about traffic. But, the people in the yellow jackets (people that work the venue) are not much help at all. Then, there are NOOOOOO signs postings around the streets to direct the Uber and Lyft drivers (which would have been helpful)!!We got into the Orangewood Drive traffic and was following the other drivers down this hill. We got close the venue, and then they told the drive, that Uber and Lyft, had to go back up the hill, back on Orangewood Ave. and they had a special entrance to the parking lot area. (*mind you, this was AFTER over half hour following detours around the area). What should have been a 15-20 min drive, was almost an hour (to drive 10 miles)!!!Once we got to the venue, we had to find our Section. Now, entering under Lot H, you are right under the famous Rose Bow sign, which is where the last section ends (upper 20's). We were looking for 1-10 area. One person said to go left, and go all the way around. But, we stopped and asked another person working the event, they said to go right. We opted to go that way. And, like ball parks now adays, there are NO ramps, and can not walk INSIDE to go to number. You are walking towards our tunnel number, and once we go out of the tunnel, we noticed we were at row 34. We were happy about that, as at least were halfway there. We had to go to row 75 (next to last top row). First couple of rows you could put hand on upper part of tunnel, after that, you were on your own. There were NO hand rails, and the steps were big! I had to hold onto the end chairs as I climbed each step. I was out of breath by the time we go to our seats. The seats themselves were very small! Your legs are pressed into the person in front of you. You had to keep your arms in your lap, as you could not even extend your arm to the arm rests. When we walked into our seats, and many more after us, going in and out...everybody has to stand up, or nobody is getting thru that row!We left before the encore of the concerts, so we could get ourselves downstairs. That proved to be more difficult, as people had put food in stairway area too! I luckily, used my boyfriend's shoulder to hold onto as I took each step down. My legs were wabbly when we got back out of the tunnel!Then, the FUN (NOT) begun!! First the people working the event, would not allow you go out the way you came in. So we had to go our side entrance, and walk towards LOT H (the front were we started) to catch Lyft (which they had a tent for), Urber and Taxis. They had this metal fence that blocked people in, and only one way out to the Ubers. You could call to book them, but once they found out where you were, a lot of us got ""Cancelled"" on our phones. Also, we heard policemen were not letting any new Ubers in, as thery had too many in there already. So, plan ""B"", which is what we should have done in the beginning (but, my legs were wabbly), we had to start walking OUT of the venue, and UP HILL...many hills. A Herd of us were all walking up Rosemont street to Orangewood. Once we got out of the main area where cars were barely drive, near Walnut, we finally called another Uber. My boyfriend and I were soooooo tired by this point. We were so glad to see our Uber driver!! We left the Venue at 10:30. By the time we got picked up by that Uber, it was 12:30PM!I will never go back to the Rose Bowl again!",Christina G
40,Went to the U2 concert on 5/20/17,The Rose Bowl is awesome the seats are not very comfortable and a little tight for the average American. My wife and I are both fairly fit and so the amount of space allocated was fine but the people seated around us were larger and had to squeeze into the space. the Concert was awesome and the set up was incredible. The stadium is cement and metal and it made for a buzzing sound when the guitar was rocking.,davesiddoway
30,"Great transport, safe but drinks and bathrooms need improving","We went to see U2 concert (which was amazing) :)We parked downtown for dinner with friends then used the shuttle to get to and from the stadium and it was excellent, safe, quick and cheap.Getting into stadium was bit slow with security that could have been better, inefficient but partly due to many folks despite warning turning up with items that were clearly not allowed.Inside was a bit of a zoo before the start, long lines for especially womens bathrooms and longer wait to get drinks from very inefficient servers.Our seats were cramped and not very comfortable and no cup holders so a pain with others coming and going, and we had some loud mouth drunk idiots behind us that somewhat spoilt the experience.But felt safe and amazing show, sounds system and visuals.",David J
40,Go just to see ut,"Came here twice. Both times for a U2 concert. The stadium is massive. It's a historic venue and it's nice to see.There are plenty of entrances and bathrooms. The staff is good at working the huge amounts of people.Took us about 1 hour 15 minutes to get on the shuttle. The line just goes FOREVER, but it does move. After all they're herding about 92,000+ people!There's plenty to eat and drink for purchase.We had bleacher seats. Uncomfortable.It's cool to say you've seen a concert at the iconic Rose Bowl Stadium.",maryaling
30,Expensive flea market,"We went to the Rose Bowl flea market, second Sunday of each month, first time, it was disappointing. Prices are very high, not any cheaper than what you can find in internet, and some vendors are arrogant. I would never go there again. You find better deals at local flea markets that are not so promoted as this one.",laurapoint
30,Visited for Ucla vs Stanford football game,"Rose Bowl is beautiful and historic stadium. One of a kind. Must see a football game here. For sure.However the peripherals are shabby and poorly maintained. Restrooms are not nice and often over-crowded. Be prepared to wait in long lines.Also the largest negative about Rose Bowl is the huge, congested bottleneck of humanity that develops around the entrance area to the stadium about 45 minutes to 15 minutes before kick-off. My goodness. People can get hurt Trampled. Injured type of situation if Rose Bowl doesn't sort it out.There must be a better way to organize the entrances in a more systematic and safer line-up format to enter the Rose Bowl.",JPBayArea2016
50,Beyoncé Concert,"This venue is truly incredible. Located in Pasadena, the Rose Bowl is massive. I went for a concert which was sold out so I was concerned that getting in would take a while or be a hassle. I was pleasantly surprised that the Rose Bowl has many entrances and well trained staff so entry went fast. Inside the outdoor venue, you feel like you're part of the action pretty much wherever you sit. I would love to go back!",Dashboard179
30,Go because it is on your bucket list,"First, research your seats. The seats closest to the field are not elevated, and should be priced accordingly. Seats closest to the tunnels are the best as they are elevated for a good view, and allows easy access to the concessions and washrooms. The concessions are outside the stadium, and are first rate.The seats are hard, so bring a cushion.Traveling to the stadium by train, then walking several blocks to a bus, then bussing to the stadium, is tricky. Leaving by bus involves entering fenced pens and being herded back and forth through the parking lot for 45 minutes until we got on a bus that left us with a 4 block walk back to the train in the middle of the night.It's a once in a lifetime experience--- but only once.",daviddD3505IR
40,"a great base for jogging, walking, hiking",Great access to a paved trail around the rose bowl as well as some walking trails in the canyons of pasadena.A couple folks had recommended running there and given the crowds in the parking lot at 6:30am....others feel the same way-,BoulderTravelers5
50,Great place for a weekend 5K or 10K run,"I go to the Rose Bowl to run. One loop around the stadium, parking and adjacent golf course is 3.1 miles - 5K. The weekends are busy with walkers, runners and cyclists. Parking is OK, just don't go on the Swap Meet weekend. The Rose Bowl is nestled in the foothills of Pasadena so it's scenic. The loop has small hills so you can get a good workout. When you're finished, there are plenty of places within a 5-10 min drive for a good meal.",DeniseWakeman

40,"Historical, neat, bathrooms....",On the road we needed to make a pit stop and the Rose Bowl seemed to be a great place. The bathrooms there need a little help but are readily accessible. Great photo op of the big ROSE BOWL sign and on the weekdays there are very few people around but buses do show up.There is no admission to the parking lot and it is nice to say that I have been there.,creeker000
40,This historical stadium should be on your Bucket List,"Easy to find. Parking is crazy for the Rose Bowl Game. Get there super early or make alternative parking arrangements. There are strict rules as to what you can take in and the size of your carryons. I just took my phone, keys and wallet in my pocket. Make it easy on yourself. Once your ticket is scanned and you are inside, take the time to check out the various plaques and markings on the walls. Plenty of eateries. Bathrooms weren't too crowded. Our seats were in the end zone right beneath the large screen so although we saw the game fine as it's not like you are up too high; we did not get to see any of the replays or special videos because they only have that one screen. That would probably be the only thing I would change. We saw a great game. Leaving was pure madness. Our friends who took the shuttle from downtown Pasadena said it took forever to get back to their car. So just be prepared about the logistics. Other than that, this is a must see place to visit at least once in your lifetime.",joyceTL4
50,Great Aquatic center,"The swimming at the Rose Bowl Aquatic center is perfect for swimmers of all abilities. You can get a daily pass for under $10 or purchase by the month, quarter etc. They have on- going classes or just lap swim. The pools are outdoor and heated. They have a big 50 meter lap pool and a big 25 yard pool. There is generally no wait for a lane. If you are a swimmer I highly recommend checking this out. They also have a nice little mercantile and cafe.",Sheri B
40,Great Venue...But Don't Come Late,"**Warning: Be careful with the size of purse you bring in, they will not let you enter if it's out of compliance.Went to Rose Bowl to see Coldplay (amazing!). My friend and I got there early and didn't have trouble getting parked, but it did cost $25. There were a bunch of different stands that had food and seats outside of the venue, which was nice. Also, lots of port-o-potties.Getting into the venue to sit did take a really long time, and security was tight. Definitely leave lots of time for this.Once in, good acoustics, good views, super small seats though (knees hit the seats in front).Would definitely go again for another big name!!",Robonski
50,What a fun tour!,"My husband surprised me with this Rose Bowl tour. Our tour guide Marietta was wonderful. She shared lots of wonderful information about Anaheim, restaurants, beaches and the Rose Bowl. This tour kept us busy for several days. We would load up on our comfortable motor coach and would sit back and enjoy our sightseeing. We drove down Hollywood blvd. We also took a tour of downtown LA. We went to Santa Monica Pier, where lunch was provided. We also visited an auto museum, the Space museum and also a behind the scene tour of the float assembly. The morning of the Rose Bowl Parade, we went downstairs and enjoyed a good breakfast, loaded up on our bus and headed down to the parade. we were provided hot chocolate when we arrived, it was a chilly morning, so this was wonderful. We were able to walk around the parade route before taking our seats. Our seats were around the turn and across from the museum. They were wonderful seats! The seats are very tight, but we were around wonderful people. I recommend going to the bathroom before you sit down, it is disruptive having to get up and go to the bathroom during the parade. the bathrooms are located under the grandstands. Wonderful tour, wonderful tour guide and driver.",Lori Y
50,The Granddaddy of Them All!!!,"This famous stadium built in 1921 is an icon of the city hosting the Annual Rose Bowl football game and numerous concerts and festivals throughout the year.

Plenty of places to Jog and appreciate the natural beauty of the surroundings.",dmasu2005
40,Touchdown!,"We are huge Penn State fans so we decided to make the trip to Pasadena this past year to see PSU vs. USC. The game was epic to say the least. We wish the outcome would have been different, but we thoroughly enjoyed our trip to the Rose Bowl. The USC fans were super nice and friendly, which made the trip so much better. Overall, the stadium itself is historic. We liked the idea of being there better than actually being there. Since it was very rainy the days leading up to the game, the field around the stadium was extremely muddy. It was disgusting walking to the game. The stadium itself was smaller and narrower. Also, I'm glad I'm an athletic person because there's shuttles to the stadium, but you have to arrive hours before to wait for one. We decided to walk the couple miles through the neighborhoods to get to the stadium. Finally, it took hours to exit the stadium. The staff put up fences for people to wait for shuttles out of the stadium. However, the person who set them up was not very intelligent because they set them up in a way that kept every person stuck in the stadium. We spent at least 2 hours stuck in the stadium trying to exit it. We finally made our way out when people broke a fence down so we could escape.",Carley R
20,Underwhelmed in Pasadena,"Myth, Legend, Iconic, Historic ... yes, it doesBut, as a sports venue ... lacking in so many ways ... grounds are ordinary, restrooms are few, crowded, and long lines ... concessions are limited ... crowded tunnels ... only one big screen available ... not impressed ... Try the Big 10 stadiums for venues",Chuck2010
50,"Iconic venue, a must for any football fan.","Just got back from attending my second Rose Bowl (alas both were Penn State defeats) and would highly encourage any football fan to make an effort to see a game in this iconic venue. The stadium itself, sits in the Arroyo Seco, an ancient dry riverbed a mile or two from Pasadena's famous Colorado Boulevard. The huge valley is quite picturesque, being ringed by the San Gabriel mountains in the distance. There is a huge ""green"" (lawn) in front of the stadium–which serves as a parking area and a golf course is located at the stadium's opposite end. The facility was built in the early part of the 20th century, so don't expect many (if any) of the modern amenities which are standard in newer stadiums and arenas. Firstly, the stadium was built as an oval and generally, with these type of stadiums, the higher up that you sit-the better the view of the action that you will have. This is because of the gradual slope of the seating, with the first 10-30 rows being relatively ""flat"". The seating consists of metal benches. Some have ""chairbacks (mostly the rows between the twenty yard lines and some of them don't. To my knowledge, there are no club seats here, although there is a rather large press box-so I'm sure that there are some private suites as well. There are 2 scoreboards, one at the top of each end zone but only one of them is a ""Jumbotron"" allowing you to watch the game and see replays. Concessions and restrooms are located outside of the seating area and ring the stadiums perimeter. There are a huge variety of concessions available here but it isn't possible to watch the action on the field while waiting in the beer or hotdog line. Similarly, the restrooms are small and cramped, so expect huge lines at halftime. Finally, both access and parking can be difficult as well. The stadium is accessed through (mostly) two lane roads and most (if not all) pass through residential neighborhoods, virtually ensuring that both ingress and egress will not be quick!Despite all of the faults that I've detailed, I'd still recommend viewing a game at the Rose Bowl. The event itself, is the attraction here and nothing detracts from that. Modern stadiums, flush with amenities are nice but they the sorely lack the history and soul of stadiums like the Rose Bowl. If you ever happen to be sitting here on New Year's Day watching a football game being played on green grass while looking out at mountain peaks in fall-like weather when most of those watching at home are wishing that they were you-then you'd know what I'm referring too!",591WilliamB591
50,Rose Bowl Tour,"A friend who is a tour guide gave us a great tour. We learned the history through pictures of the stadium and viewed pictures of UCLA and other greats in the locker rooms.

It is in a beautiful location in Pasadena right next to the Brookside Golf Course, a public venue.",John15-1

10,DUMP!!!!! UCLA should be very ashamed.,"This stadiuhm hasn't been renovated in decades. Far too few restrooms. Lines for both men and women over half hour long. Some stairways are actually dangerous. I am 4'10"" and 65 years old and our seats were in row 76 of 77. The stairs up had NO handrail a d each step was at least 12 inches high. It was an incredible struggle for me to get up the stairs until a gentleman saw me fighting to raise my short, old legs and helped me. Then, up that high, there are no restrooms. I would have had to go all the way down and back up. No way could I do that. Husband went down at beginning of halftime for bathroom and, due to long lines, didn't get back until halfway through third quarter.Parking is just as bad. Haphazard, no organization. Friend was parked so far away, he didn't get into game until halfway through first quarter.Questions below. I don't recommend this stadium in any weather. UCLA should be very ashamed of the conditions here.",NittanyLioness73

30,Not going to review the game,"When stadiums sell beer and other alcohol beverages to especially students and other young people, it means that there is undoubtedly lots of drunken folks sitting nearby. Their crude and rude behavior made for an uncomfortable situation for those of us who were trying to watch the game. Drinking beer requires one to continually walk in front of others on the way for refills and bathroom breaks. Restroom and food lines were extremely long. But . . . we got to see the Rose Bowl (even though my team lost).",Deb G
40,"Great time & memories, but be prepared for long lines everywhere","Penn State vs USC game was a thriller that helped create great memories. I was unable to secure tickets beforehand, but was able to work with a scalper. The game was a VERY hot ticket, so there were inflated rates and no negotiating. The tickets ended up being in the USC section, so our Penn State apparel clearly stuck out. While many of the USC fans displayed low class, we never felt in danger.Getting thereWe took the Metro Gold Line to Memorial Station, which turned out to be a great move. It was $1.75 each way, and dropped us a few blocks from the stadium shuttles. It was safe before and after the game.The line to get on the shuttles was literally about a mile long, but it kept moving. We were there 3.5 hours before kickoff, so I'd imagine the line got longer after us.We were supposed to meet friends for a tailgate on the golf course, but signage was weak and the area was quite crowded. We determined it would take too long to get to the tailgate and back to the stadium, so we hung out near the stadium where there were ample food and beverage options. They also had big screen TVs to watch other football games.The majority of ""seats"" are bleachers, so you get to become close with your new neighbors. Lines for restrooms were long, but moved at a decent pace except for halftime. At least one of the concession stands had computer issues, causing long delays and forcing us to use cash if we wanted to move along a little faster.Be prepared for an expensive day: as a benchmark, 16 oz beer inside the stadium is $14. A brat and fries was a $20 meal.I'm glad to attend the game and experience the Rose Bowl, but don't relish the idea of returning.",Ron R
10,The worlds most enchanting athletic venue has a dirty little secret,"This venue is quite possibly the worlds most enchanting athletic than you, but it is also possibly the worst spectator sport venue in the United States of America!The sightlines here are wonderful and you are close to the action but, the access in and out of the seating bowl is absolutely scary. The tunnels are no more than 10 to 15 feet wide and the seating areas are approximately 50 people across; therefore, if you were sitting in the middle of the row you have to climb over 25 people to get to the island. And, you should hope those 25 people are about average size so that you're not sitting in your neighbors lap.The parking for the Rose Bowl is on the golf course. That can make for epic tailgating but, keep your senses about you as you walk back to your car as things seem to jump out of nowhere to trip you away.Everything you are given prior to an event that says arrive early is absolutely true! It would seem that each road into the venue is two lanes. Same way to get out. With 100,000 people plan on being around for a while. Public transportation is your best bet. It is a hike but take it vantage of it.As with any stadium these days there are rules on what can be taken into the stadium. Follow them or you will be leaving behind your favorite goodies and bags.Once inside the concessions are extraordinarily old school and the food is really horrible. They serve beer for the Rose Bowl game off of palettes therefore, not very cold. Besides the fact that they charge an arm and a leg for these items.Don't even think about using the restroom facilities in this antiquated stadium. They are absolutely disgusting! The county health department should be shutting down the stadium due to the health risks perpetuated by these bathrooms and their concession stands nearby. Somebody is asleep on this subject..... I wouldn't wish my personal experience is restrooms on my worst enemy.In conclusion, in this day and age when concert festivals and sporting venues are offering an upscale experience with clean bathrooms and good food and cold beverages for the same prices as the Rose Bowl charges you are better off at another venue. The football game should actually be moved or the health department of the county should require that they bring everything up up-to-date!",salesguytoo
50,USC vs. Penn State,"Amazing to have finally checked this off my bucket list!!! Such a thrill to be part of the ""Granddaddy of them all""!We walked from the parade route (Colorado Blvd. near Orange Grove) to the Rose Bowl and it took about 40 minutes (it's about a mile and a half, but you're going around freeway interchanges and lots of people). We could have taken a free shuttle but a) we wanted the walk after sitting and getting a bit cold at the parade and b) the line up of shuttles was tremendous and at the point that we got to the shuttle area, nothing was leaving yet, so we figured walking was easier.We met friends at the golf course, adjacent to the Rose Bowl, just north of the stadium, to tailgate. Once at the golf course, we had to walk a long way around Penn State's alumni tailgate to get to our friends' area, but that only amounted to 10 more minutes of walking.From the golf course taligate, we left at 1:00 for the 2:00 kick-off. The security line was a bit of a mash initially, but then we were funneled through metal barricade bars (a la any amusement park line). If you have NO bag, there is an express line. If you're carrying your clear tote, you go through the regular line. Everyone goes through a metal detector. This part took about 25 minutes.After you're through security, you get to the stadium gates where you present your ticket to get in. This only took 5 minutes.We entered at section 14 and had to walk around to get to our tunnel 10. It was crowded with people, but this only took about 5 minutes. We were in our seats at 1:45 and there was still a marching band on the field.There is no covered concourse: it's all outdoors on this main entry level. Concessions and bathrooms are at the same lentry evel. Once through your tunnel, your seats are either up stairs or down stairs.We were in a section of bleachers. There is not enough room to be comfortable. We were literally squished next to our seatmates the whole 4 hours. bleachers are numbered, but as soon as a ""large"" person fills a space, the person next to them loses some of their space. It's kind of dog eat dog. We put up with it because it's the ""Granddaddy"". We stood most of the time, which is expected.Beers were $14 so do your best at the tailgate!The stealth bomber flyover started from the end zone with the jumbo-tron; good to know if you want to anticipate photo opportunities; don't know if it's this way every year.You won't regret it if you're a football fan....I'd go again in a second!",LRRmom
40,A Memory Maker,"We went to the Rose Bowl for the PSU vs. USC game. Being there was just surreal. The only reason I didn't give it five stars was the infrastructure was old and it was quite tricky to go up and down the bleachers. Also, you had to go a long way to get to the restroom.",L P
20,Very poorly managed.,"Lines at the restrooms were long. Lines to the concession stands were long. No concession stands directly inside the stadium (like the coliseum). I used to think the Coliseum was terrible however it is 10x better than the Rose Bowl. Bad access to stadium. Barricades everywhere which makes you feel like cattle. If it wasnt for the Rose Bowl, I would not have gone to the game. I will refuse to go there for a regular season game.",Gary P
50,Rose Bowl!!!!,The granddaddy of them all. Love this stadium. Go if you have a team you want to watch.It's in a fabulous area and full of energy. Haven't been in 30 years and it's still amazing!,familytravel4
50,Last Friday of the month public tour review,"I travel to L.A. for work and my 70 year old father who had never been to the west coast wanted to accompany me on one of my trips. We're from the south so football is sacred to us and while I'd driven out and seen the outside of the Rose Bowl before, I was thrilled to learn they'd be offering a public tour of the stadium while he was in town.Ours was a small group, from all over the U.S. and the U.K. and we had a great tour guide, who provided lots of Rose Bowl history and fun facts. You're shown a short video to start the tour and off it goes. You are able to see the first locker room they used way back in the day, walk the parameter of the stadium via the seats, see the current home and visitor locker rooms, and see the press boxes and other luxury boxes for the folks with cash to spend. We were told NOT to step on the field but my dad did anyways because he does what he wants at his age, to the embarrassment of his daughter. ;-)If your luck allows you to be in Pasadena the last Friday of any month, head on over and check out the Granddaddy of Them All. The tour only lasts about an hour, maybe less. Pasadena is close to L.A. so it's worth the short drive over in my opinion.",gagirl75
30,The Rose Bowl Game,"I wanted this stadium to be all that I had hoped, as it was on my Bucket List. It is a tremendously famous stadium, and classic looking , but it was cramped and tight to anyone 6 feet or taller. We couldn't understand any of the PA announced calls or messages. Nobody could! The acoustics were terrible, nothing but echoes and muffled sounds. Really expected to actually hear and understand what was announced. PA, field microphones, even the officials calls. After the game ended we got caught in a mob mentality crowd blocked in from exiting to the parking lot, blocked from the entry to shuttle busses, and barricades prevented an ambulance to get through with a patient aboard! More than 30 minutes passed before several stadium workers and police moved some fencing, barricades and got the crowds to finally begin to exit. Not organized for 90,000 + fans to move safely out of and away from the stadium. It was a snap-finger away from a semi riot. Rose Bowl committee, please get this improved.",John M
20,WTH??,"Wow, I was shocked at the Rose Bowl Stadium from the parking attendants and the seat ushers to the outdated quality of the stadium. It took us almost 2 hours to go from Rose Parade to the stadium parking. Reason? No one was directing traffic. Cars were blocking intersections by just not moving; police present on site were all in a group chatting; people were getting out of their cars to complain...It was a nightmare.Once in the stadium, the usher had no clue where the row I was sitting in was. He kept telling me to proceed down from the tunnel when in actuality, I needed to go UP. Luckily, I know my number line and was able to figure it out.There are limited bathrooms, which can be a typical complaint, but these are very outdated. One stall was literally a door leaning against the frame off hinges and all.Inside the stadium there is only one big screen to serve as a prompter for replays, etc and it happened to be behind me. Inconvenient to watch a game backwards. All in all, it needs updated.",travelbuddy22
50,Excellent venue for a game.,"First time at the Rose Bowl, but I've been to plenty of other stadiums. This one is one of the best. The Rose Bowl committee makes things easy for the spectators, much like at the Augusta National. They issued a spectator booklet and there were plenty of signs leading the way to the stadium.",Tommy H
50,Once you're in it's truly an experience!,It's a beautiful stadium and great venue to watch football once you get in. Leave yourself plenty of time to stand in line at security and getting into the tunnels. Higher seats offer better vantage point for viewing play development. Its called the most famous of all stadiums for a reason and rich in history! It's a nice walk from the parade to the game and you can avoid the traffic.,Lisa P
30,In dire need of attention,"A wonderful opportunity. A chance to relive the glory days at university, cheer on one's alma mater and perhaps reunite with lost friends - if you can navigate the roads, barricades, cement blocks, gates and other detours necessary to get in to the stadium. Wear trainers because of the poor layout of the facility, you will be walking quite a bit.Whatever activity you might partake in a sporting arena: eating, purchasing merchandise, walking around, ingress, egress, even occasionally using the loo, prepare to wait in line. And really wait in line while the game rumbles on, or the crowd presses on, and you are missing out because of such incredibly poor planning in an outdated venue. The food fare is adequate if limited, but that is not a reason to avoid or attend the location.Had there been some medical emergency, the mad rush would certainly cause additional casualties. Curiously, after this last game, no person seemed to move as the egress was hopelessly clogged and the fans began to walk down the bench seating. One fall would easily result in 15 more injuries!The Rose Bowl is something that should be experienced at least once, if possible. But were I to get a second opportunity, without this facility undergoing a major overhaul and renovation in the meantime, I would turn it down.",ArthurGFGadfly
50,Rose Bowl Game,"Trojans won! No other comment necessary. However, the experience is electric when USC is playing in the bowl game. The best photo op is in front of the stadium when you enter under the rose bowl sign.",Sylvia W
50,Great Place to see a football Game,"Went to the 2017 Rose Bowl USC vs Penn State and it was not only a great game, but an incredible venue to watch a game. Great site lines, fairly comfortable seating and easy to access by Uber and foot. Hope to return in the future",flashbridgewater
20,Rose Bowl Transportation,"After reading community reviews we decided to take the shuttle to and from the Parsons parking lot to the stadium. The trip over was super easy and based on reviews we expected long lines for the rerun trip. What we experienced on the return trip was quite scarey. People were pushing into line, several gates had been toppled, at one point, people were knocking bikes over and pushing to get into a small opening and we actually saw one person with a bloody nose. Where there were security personnel they did their best to control the crowds, but in the spaces were there were no personnel, it was pandemonium. Never experienced anything like it. We ended up walking back to pasedena as the shuttle is really the only form of transportation and the line stretch at least 3/4s of a mile 2 hours after the game ( captured the distance on a fit bit) The chaos may have been due to an overly rowdy and inebriated crowd and the game went down to the wire meaning 90,000 people leaving at the same time. The walk back was not far ( regardless of what the reviews say as you do not follow the bus route) Uber was stationed one mile from the stadium and would only pick up there and there were no cabs. If you go, either leave the game early or find an alternative way home. They say the wait is not that bad in line, but the human factor was down right scarey and we heard on a police scanner that three bricks had been thrown at one of the shuttles cracking the windshield.",Maggie5698
30,Rose Bowl/Rose Bowl Parade Experience,"Out of Towners, we weren't sure of the best way to experience both the Rose Bowl game and parade. We ended up arriving at 6 A.M and got a fabulous parking experience. From there we walked into town for the parade. We weren't sure Uber could get us into town due to road closures. We were far down the parade route, the 1500 block. The Rose Bowl is close to the beginning to the parade, about a 1 1/2 mile walk. The 1500 block is about 3 miles. There was a huge line (I mean huge!) for parade holders to enter at the beginning of the route. Security was insistent that we enter there, but then a program director, told us we could walk on a parallel street away from the crowd, a much better solution. Yes, it was a long walk but certainly doable.Great place to tailgate, but don't drink too much of any beverage! I've never seen lines to Port-a-Potties so long. Waiting in a cue 20 to 30 minutes is unacceptable. Same thing happened inside the stadium where I missed 20 minutes of the game at the end of the 1st quarter. Ironically, lines for food seemed reasonably short.Plenty of security was visible in the stadium. They monitored alcohol consumption.The stadium was fine, but old. Wish the had a second big screen for easier viewing of replays.",RussandAnne
30,Bowl Extravaganza,"Old stadium with terrible parking arrangements. Either (1)Uber close to the stadium and walk the last .5-1 mile or (2) arrive 3-4 hours before game time. (3)Drive to your designated lot and pray for a miracle that will get you through the parking mess, better known as the ""Pit of Despair"". Or try door (4), and drive as close as your nerves will allow, and park wherever possieRble (public or private yds) and again, walk the rest of the way. Ugh, the parking experience is a nitemare!! Did I mention this already...the parking! ...A Nitmare!!!The food was good, with some interesting selections. Loved the crepe sandwiches! The stadium itself is a sort of neat/cool older venue....and you will enjoy it in a nostalgic way; but again, only if you survive the parking lunacy of this location; which basically is masquerading as anything remotely organized.So be warned.....plan your drive well, when attending events at the Rose Bowl.",johnnie79

30,Not up to its iconic status,"A stadium I have seen on tv on many occasions watching american football but in the flesh a big let down.The seating is very poor - benches - and in many places you are a long way from the playing area.Stewarding of the local derby game between UCLA and USC was a joke with numerous fights breaking out and stewards taking a good five minutes or more to arrive to deal with the situation.In all honesty, the place is no longer fit for purpose and should be pulled down or severely renovated, neither of which is going to happen due to its status as one of college football's iconic stadiums",ColinDCwmbran_Wales
40,Great Place for Walk or Run,We were staying in old town Pasadena and wanted to get in a nice walk and run.

There is food available and sometimes music entertainment near the stadium. You can also check out the rose bowl while you're there. Make sure you have cash to buy your ticket. What a great experience.",Karen1012
40,"[Rose Bowl Flea Market] Vast, great and a nice little stadium bonus…","Let me clear up straight away that the Rose Bowl Flea Market is absolutely jumbo – I’ve never seen anything like it – and there’s just about something for everyone there. It’s a real treasure trove.Second thing to say is that we were pleasantly surprised to be allowed into a section of the stadium itself for a look round. The details themselves are lost on us Brits, but we’re well aware of the fame of this grand old arena. So that was a thrill.Most important thing I want to say, though, is get there early.There are various stages of ticketing – getting a bit more expensive the earlier you go – and I’m not suggesting going with the earliest, but just any before the general admission block.For a few dollars extra (and getting out of bed a little earlier) you not only get a more peaceful experience inside the market (and, of course, a better pick of the merchandise) but driving in, parking and getting through the gates is so much easier.We know because, as we were leaving, general admission was just beginning and there were hoards of people and cars at every turn.",LDN_2009
50,Parsons Engineering Parking,"I went there last Saturday for the UCLA Standford football game at 5pm. I decided to park at Parsons and take a shuttle to the stadium. We got to the parking lot at 3pm. There were signs on the street to take you to entrance and attendants showing you where to park. I prepaid online. Otherwise, it's $15 Cash Only. I was able to find a space without any problem. The shuttle was right next to the parking structure. It was big and comfortable and took us to the stadium within minutes.After the game, I left 10 minutes early to avoid the crowd. I did not have to wait to get on the shuttle to Parsons. My overall parking experience was excellent. I will park there again. Also, the shuttle avoided different street closures to private vehicles to the stadium. Thanks.",Roy Chan

50,"Fantastic arena for a concert. Coldplay, Aug 2016","We were on vacation from Ireland, spending 3 weeks travelling around CA.As massive fans of Coldplay, I booked these tickets well in advance. However, reading trip advisor reviews of previous concerts here (mainly Beyonce earlier in the summer) I started to get downhearted at the anticipate hassle of seeing this great band at the Rose Bowl. Stories of strict security, parking woes, massive queues.Well, with a bit of common sense and forward planning, we suffered none of this.We arrived about 6 pm in Pasadena from our base in Hollywood. No traffic issues. Parked in central Pasadena and used the park and ride facility which was quick and worked well. $5 a head return. Total queuing time for the bus was about 20 mins.Dropped off 2 mins from the entrance. only 5 people in front at security and the metal detector. No issues, straight through. Incidentally , they seemed to be letting small bags through ok, and I saw they guy in from carrying his Gopro through, which annoyed me as I left mine behind due to warnings of ""no video cameras allowed""All security staff were helpful and friendly, and we got to our seats with no issues just as the first support act were starting about 7.My only complaint? the absolutely extortionate ripoff prices of food and drink. Honestly, whoever runs that setup should wear a mask and go by the name Dick Turpin. Daylight robbery!Concert of course was incredible. Afterwards, we left our seats near the back of the stadium as the last song started, as the pickup point for the buses was right round to the left of the stage.We got to the start of the park and ride queue just as the concert ended. We queued less than 8 minutes!Straight back to our car, and were on the road to Hollywood in no time.So the moral of the story, leave early, use the park and ride, and don't sit right to the death at the end. Leave early enough and you will get out without any problem.",Pauli1965
30,Rose Bowl Flea Market: Early Arrival A Must,"I visited the fleamarket in April 2016. We arrived at 6:45 a.m. and waited until the 7 am admission time. The admission cost decreases the later that you wait to enter. We parked on the street and walked across the grassy area. There was closer parking but since we arrived so early, it killed time and there was no parking cost. If you want to shop for antiques, take a hard left after you enter the gates. Most vendors will be already set up or just finishing set up by 7 a.m. I got some good deals by bargaining, and we were back home in Pasadena by 10 a.m. There are a lot of other vendors specializing in costume jewelry, vintage clothing etc.. especially across the ""bridge"".",okladytexas
40,UCLA Football Game,"This was my first time visiting the Rose Bowl and it truly is a great stadium! The food is awesome and bathrooms are clean, staff is also friendly. However, parking is was horrible. Apart from buying tickets for whatever event you are attending there, you have to pay parking($25) and the parking is far. If you do not get there super early you are going to park far, it took my boyfriend and I about 15 minutes of walking, even though we paid. Overall, it is an awesome stadium!!!",DianaVP28
20,Uber disaster!,"Great stadium but the least knowledgeable event staff I've ever encountered! We left a UCLA game at the start of the 4th quarter and asked no less than 10 people working the event where we could catch an Uber ride and the first 9 had no clue and the 10th sent us on a half mile walk in the completely wrong direction. AND to make matters much worse, there is no designated Uber pick up and you have to walk a mile, uphill to the corner of Saco St. and Lincoln to be picked up! I recommend you DON'T UBER FROM THE ROSE BOWL!!!",Sightsee625940
50,Nice place to run/bike,"When I lived in Pasadena, I loved coming to run at the Rose Bowl, lots of people there, especially on the weekends. If you go all the way around it's a little more than 3 miles and there is usually always free parking unless there is an event. There is a separate path for joggers and dog walkers. You can also bike around but you will be on the street with traffic. Lots of green areas too to warm up/stretch out in or walk the dog around (not off leash).",Varesha108
40,ColdPlay Concert August 20th,"#1 tip- if you are in no rush and don't mind waiting to leave, then you can drive but arrive hours before the event to prepare for traffic and road closures. Parking is still at $20 so if you see signs for parking before you hit gridlock, do it. You will walk anyway.Even uber/ and taxis were stuck in traffic.We parked in downtown Pasadena and it was about less than a 2 mile walk. If you're wearing comfortable shoes and don't mind it, at totally doable.The stress were gridlocked and they closed all the roads to only have 1 way in and 1 way out. I'm sure there's a reason for it.The stadium was easily accessible and clean enough. Lots of security and ushers to help find your seats.Be aware of your things as its' not that easy to spot in the dark. Travel light and keep an eye on each other.Food selection is random inside but there's food truck vendors outside before the entrance. Bring cash.Overall, I love this venue because it's open air and ventilation isn't a concern during a cool night. We had such an awesome time.Ladies: wear comfortable shoes, avoid pointy heels bec of the grass area on your way in. Bring a jacket, it gets cool after dark.",Lizen Y
30,COLDPLAY CONCERT,"Everything about this venue ws amazing, with the exception of transportation - and ESPECIALLY after the concert. There were a lot of security personnel there, and everyone must go through a metal detector, which made me feel safe. The acoustics were amazing. There really aren't 'bad seats' in my opinion. There are plenty of refreshments. Be aware of the strict bag requirement. All womens purses are prohibited, along with backpacks. The only approved bags are clear totes ( purchased mine on Amazon). If you show up with a purse, you have to 'check it' for a fee. No pick up is available at the bowl. Everyone must walk at least a mile or so to reach the uber or taxi zones. This is very inconvenient to be sure. Your only other option is for a shuttle, which had 100 people in line afyer concert. If wasn't for this hassle, I woukd give 5 stars! We had a FANTASTIC time seeing our FAVORITE BAND, COLDPLAY",Robyn P
10,Concert,"Traffic getting in was terrible...Terrible! We left or hotel 1 mile away at 7pm, by 7:45 we only went a block so I got out of the car and walked. I get to the gate and there's a huge crowd, no lines, people pushing to get in. Took about 30 minutes through a bunch of crowds to get in. As I walk around I realize there are multiple other gates to get in with no one in them. Of course there was no one directing the huge horde of people.Back to the car I got out of, my husband didn't get to the bowl until about 8:45...that's 1 hour 45 minutes to go 1 mile. Parking was $40, he made it to our seat literally as the band started.Realized when it started that we didn't get wrist bands as we entered the gates which light up with the music...that sucks.I don't think I'd ever go to an event there again.",Sumerle D

20,Coldplay concert- parking and access,"The Coldplay show was amazing but this review is for the Rose Bowl.We received several emails prior to the event discussing the security and parking policies and I appreciated them letting us know ahead of time what to expect.The security was challenging... They said that purses and bags were not allowed and that you could bring a clear plastic bag or a very small clutch. There was a bag check area and i also saw people with bags and small purses inside. We did get the fast security with the clear plastic bags.Parking: Yikes!!Lots of warnings about parking...general was $40 (golf course, exit time 1+hourPriority $80Parsons $20+$5pp shuttleWe chose the parsons lot and arrived with enough time to eat (with a reservation) in old town.

We walked down for 15-20 min and still hadn't reached the end when we realized it would be an hour plus before we would be at our car. So we walked to Parsons... Along with hundreds of other people. We took up a lane of traffic. And it took us about 20 more minutes and we exited easily.The uber and lyft drivers trying to enter to pick up passengers were at a stop, a line of hundreds and no one was moving.This was a mess...it's always a wait to exit a big event as everyone wants to leave ASAP, but this was the worst I've seen...",JacqB

40,Excellent Event - Coldplay - A Head Full of Dreams Tour 2016,"The place itself is excellent; the bad part is their parking fees for $80 to park right next the stadium about 5 minutes walk to the gate. I parked right in Jackie Robinson's Field Lot I were it cost me $40 and to walk to the stadium is 15 minutes. It was not a bad 15 minutes walk. I arrived around 3pm and there was plenty of parking and I noticed even around 5pm there's still a lot of parking space. The venue was 7:00pm and 3 to 4 hours ahead of time to go or park your car is a breeze. I noticed a lot of complaints about the parking and direction; all you need is a good planning and patience and going to Rose Bowl the last hour before the big event; you really are asking for it and that's were the confusion starts and rush of looking for parking space and looking for directions. If you take uber they will not allow you to be drop in front of the event and so it's like parking your car too, because they have a designated uber drop-off and pick-up station located in the vicinity of Jackie Robinson's Field Lot I, and also there was more foot traffic than car traffic when I was heading out of the parking lot. If you're driving to Rose Bowl and you're there 3 to 4 hours ahead of time there's plenty of parking space, park and relax; bring your own food and that will compensate your arm and a leg parking fee.",Globe_TrekkerXXX

There literarilly was something for everyone. You will really enjoy this as a fun adventure for a group of friends.",David_DeMulle
30,"Beautiful Venue, Terrible Access","We went to the Rose Bowl to see Coldplay. The venue was really beautiful. We live in Arizona and have never been there before and were excited for the opportunity to enjoy this iconic stadium. For those also new to the venue, you may appreciate knowing:1) much of the seating is bleacher-style (no seat backs)2) there are only one or two ways in/out of that stadium. It's called the Rose ""Bowl"" for a reason: it's in the bowl of a canyon. We took Uber in. They had a designated drop-off zone for rideshare services, such as Uber and Lyft. A good idea, but it was terribly backed up. We ended up just letting our driver drop us off about a mile outside of the stadium area and walked in. No problem.After the show was an entirely different story. I'm sorry, but you would have thought this was the Rose Bowl's first ever concert. We left the show early, knowing there would be a bit of a wait for Uber. We got to the designated pick-up area, and there were a number of drivers there waiting for you to ping them using the app.Problem 1: the app crashed. There were about 100-200 others who did the same thing, so the app crashed.Problem 2: all the cars waiting there seemed to be either XL or Select. Our $70 ride to the show was turning into a $250-350 ride back out. About an hour later, out of desperation, we tried selecting one of these over-priced rides and the app just tried and tried to connect us, then timed out. No luck.So we tried the cab pick-up line....No cabs...None, this is now after the show when you'd think there would be cabs abound. We found out that there had been one cab show up in an hour. It's now about midnight and there are literally hundreds and hundreds of people trying to get out of there. We just started walking, uphill out of the canyon. We walked about 2-3 miles before we were able to flag down a cab and beg him to take us (he was supposed to only pick people up in the dreaded pick-up zone). We walked past about 100 uber/lyft cars sitting in the queue waiting to pick up their fares. At 12:45, now almost 2 hours after the show let out, I saw a flash on our cabbie's monitoring notifying all cab drivers that assistance was needed at the Rose Bowl.I can't imagine how things would have gone for us if one of us had a disability or injury that forced us to wait there in the dreaded ride share zone. I really think we would have been there until 2 or 3 in the morning. As it was, we didn't get back to our hotel until after 1:00 a.m. Next time, well, we'd pick a different venue....If you have to attend an even there and are from out-of-town, I'd recommend patience and either the shuttle service to Parsons or rent a car and brave the parking nightmare (but at least you know you'd get out - it's a total gamble if you're trying to ride share!!).",planful
30,Coldplay,"Wow, great show at the Rosebowl but getting to and from takes some planning. Shuttle to the rose bowl from old town is ok but the bottleneck after the show is terrible. We decided to walk about 2.5-3 miles to our hotel rather than wait. Concert site lines were good and music doesn't get lost in the arena. Good show overall.",andezz99
40,Coldplay Concert,"We went to see Coldplay - great concert and a great place to see a big tour like that. Our seats were off to the side about half way up but good views. Sound was OK but I guess it was hard to fill a stadium that large. Don't go to the first security points - keep going round to the back as the lines are much, much shorter.Transport is a real problem - parking $40 and very hard to get in and worse to get out after the show. Shuttle buses are better but lines very very long. We parked in Pasadena using ParkWiz to find a place. 20-30 minute walk after the show, in our car and on the 210 in no time.",MikeWH134
10,Saw Coldplay Last Night - Horrible Venue,"Last night I saw Coldplay perform at the Rose Bowl. The show was amazing, but I will never go see another show there, regardless of how big of a fan I am of the artist.When we were in our Lyft getting dropped off, there was a huge amount of traffic and disorganization entering the venue, even a cop sent us about 10 minutes away from the entrance. Another cop then stopped us and continuously berated us about this, even though we told him we were sent there by another cop. This isn't the venue's fault entirely, but added to our miserable experience.We then wait in line to enter the venue, only to be scolded again at the door and told that we cannot bring purses inside. Mind you, this was not at all communicated in advance beforehand, there were no signs, there were no people making announcements about this, etc. They directed us to go wait in another line where we were then forced to pay $10 to check in my purse.This is absolutely ridiculous. They said that we couldn't bring in bags due to safety, when they clearly could have just checked our bags and they had metal detectors, and then they charge us $10 for this bag? This was 100% security theater and used to make a profit off of concert attendees. Everyone was appalled.Walking in the venue was also a nightmare, it was incredibly crowded, there were lines of people everywhere, etc. The space itself is just very poorly designed and managed.Afterwards, we had to wait in yet another line to get our bag, and then had the nightmare of figuring out how to leave the venue. We had to walk what felt like 1/2 a mile to the Uber pickup area, where there are hundreds of people milling around and there is no service for you to order your Uber. They had a wifi hotspot that was not working. We waited in a cab line for 30 minutes hoping it would be better, but no cabs were coming and everyone just starting getting out of the line since that was useless. We finally got service and got an Uber about an hour after hanging there not knowing what to do. We got home at almost 2am from this fiasco.Coldplay was an amazing show and I'm so glad I got to see them live. However, I will promise you that unless there are massive changes with this venue, I would never go back there again.",Michelle Buser
20,Great event but the event staff were clueless!,"I attended the Coldplay concert last evening. The concert was fantastic but was marred by the chaotic conditions during and after the concert. None of the yellow clad staff that I approached could direct me to my seat. They kept asking me to go to someone else. As a result, I wandered around trying to find my entrance tunnel (just a wild guess from the ticket!). I finally found it, having arrived early as they had advised. Other more savvy Rose Bowl concert goers arrived just in time for the main act but were totally confused about the seating. They were misdirected. As we were enjoying the first sounds, people were asking for row and seat numbers because they thought someone else had taken their seat. After the concert it was complete chaos. Nobody knew how to direct people to the right places. The traffic cops were the only ones who were helpful and had a clue. People were walking in droves in circles just trying to get to old Pasadena where they had parked their cars. Thank god for our smart phones. The staff told us that they were not very familiar with the place and could not give us any guidance. Good idea to park in Old Pasadena area and walk. Just make sure you find all the information you need to get to the venue and find your seat and get back before you start!",rpillai494
10,Logistical nightmare!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This venue is the worst place to see anything. LA traffic isn't even a guess anymore so why do anything in Los Angeles anymore? Every hour is rush hour. If they know the Rose Bowl has an event, they close off all the freeway exits down and exit you three miles away from where GPS says to get off and heard you down one long road to parking in the existing golf course a mile away from the Bowl. You'll pay $40 for this special experience. An hour from the off ramp to our parking space. If it was hard getting in you can only imagine what it's like getting out of their in the pitch dark after the show. We had to leave Coldplay early because we knew the nightmare ahead. No exit strategy for leaving. It's every man for himself. Coldplay was fantastic just hope they never do another show there. Hope no band ever does a show there. This was my first Coldplay concert and I was reluctant go see them there. I was right. This place should be leveled and condos built in it's place. It's no place to see anything with a 100,000 seating capacity and only 20,000 parking spaces.",Frank S
10,"Total chaos, completely unorganized events, absolutely no customer service!","HORRIBLE Customer Service. Horrible Parking. Terrible coordination. Going to Cold Play concert tonight -- Got an email from the Rose Bowl a few days ago saying ""Don't follow your GPS, use the specific instructions which we will mail to you.""On the freeway now, I NEVER got that email from them. They NEVER answered my email asking for the directions, either. NEVER answered my email regarding questions I had about restricted items, etc.TELEPHONE SUPPORT: I have been calling their Customer Support/Administrative Offices phone number for TWO DAYS. Every time I call the recorded message says they are CLOSED, and yet I called during their normal business hours! You can leave a message -- but they NEVER return your calls!So, besides the atrocious lack of parking, having to pay $40 for this horrible parking on the golf course and having to walk for 30+ minutes to get to the gate -- they don't even bother to answer customer service calls, at all.This isn't just the case with a popular concert -- exact same problems when going to a football game as well.TOTAL CHAOS, COMPLETELY UNORGANIZED, NO CUSTOMER SERVICE WHATSOEVER.If I could give them ZERO STARS, I would have.",DianeM5

No Programmes available for any of the ICC matches missing a trick there you can get $10-20 a piece easy money. Scarfs and jerseys all poor quality and over expensive. Food fair but when my wife went to get a Pepsi at halftime she was treated like dirt by the concession stand she ended up missing half the second half and still got no Pepsi even a Chelsea said it was a disgrace how she was treated by the concession people.

The commentator was a few minutes late on everything and got facts and names wrong. Music was played when the game had started do no one realised it had started.The worst part was the incompetence of the organisers when it came to bags. We had to check in large bags; 'totes', at a tent. We received a ticket with a number for claiming it back later. The queue to picking it up was enormous. The bags had been thrown on shelves without any organisation in the chaos so staff could not find our bags as there were hundreds of them, so having the ticket was meaningless! If we could not see our bag, we couldn't have it back! If the shelves had been numbered and bags placed accordingly it would have saved everyone hours and hassle.So ladies, bring a small purse.The cost of water and food and food was astronomical -$6 for water, .$8 for popcorn.",Sandra R

40,America fest was great...,"Got reserved seats for the 2016 America fest at the Rosebowl on July 4. Because of the difficulty leaving in past years, we stayed in a hotel in nearby Pasadena. The stadium as only about 10 minutes away and made it there in short order. Heading towards the designated handicapped parking, we were checked by Pasadena PD for proper DMV paperwork. One officer's pocket was full of confiscated placards. Reminder, misuse of a placard may be a $4600 fine.The seating was good, the show started on time, the featured band ""Liverpool Legends"", did great. A Beatles tribute band, guided by George Harrison's sister, who was there. After the show, leaving the stadium was a little difficult. The 5 miles to the hotel took about an hour and a half, mostly waiting to move from the parking spot. Plan to allow a lot of time whenever leaving this venue.

40,The granddaddy of college football & swap meets,"Every true football fan dreams about snagging tickets to the Rose Bowl Tournament Considered “the granddaddy of them all,” it’s held every New Year’s Day at 1:30 p.m. following the Rose Parade (a must-do at least once), and features an exciting match-up between two of the top college teams in the nation. Not only is it a fierce battle on the field, it takes a fierce effort (and a lot of cash) to secure tickets and hotel rooms. But boy, oh boy, is it a never-to-be-forgotten scene.Locals luck out with the Rose Bowl's sprawling once-a-month swap meet. Tons of dealers circle the stadium with tents and tables filled with knickknacks, antiques, collectibles and junk that someone is just dying to find. Haggling is encouraged but some prices can be steep. This is SoCal's best swap meet, after all, and you're competing with celebrities and decorators able and willing to outbid everyone else.TIP: Go early for best selection.

But I don't think anyone was there to admire the old stadium. We were there because it is the Rose Bowl game.,IowaRod
50,Rose Bowl should be on your Bucket List!,"In 2016 we made a last minute decision to go to the Rose Bowl. I have always wanted to see the Parade and my family wanted to go for the Football. Clearly last minute means no hotels near Pasadena, but HEY that's OK! Here's a summary of how we made it work by staying in LA:1. Flights: Fly into Burbank. We did Southwest and Burbank is an easy airport to navigate. Then taxi, super shuttle, uber or rent a car. We did Uber. Super Shuttle is $17 a person, Uber was $60 to our hotel, so we went the Uber route. Cheaper for 4. LAX is just a close to LA as Burbank, so pick what fits your schedule/budget.2. Where to stay: Again, nothing in Pasadena so we stayed in LA. We stayed at the Hilton Doubletree, not super fancy, but very suitable. What you want to look for is a place that is near the Metro. The LA metro runs a gold line to Pasadena, with even more stops on Super Bowl game day. The Doubletree is walkable to Metro. It's in a neighborhood that has a lot of homeless, so that is the only downside. A taxi ride is $4, but my family of 4 walked and we were fine. It was a sunny day and there were others walking with us. It was a 10 min walk! Easy. Right into the metro station, down to the Train. At the train gate they sold one way and round trip tickets, so don't fret about getting a ticket in advance. The upside of Doubletree? Starbuck inside the hotel and great little restaurant also connected.3. The Parade: Metro Gold Line drops you 1 block from the Parade Route on Arroyo Parkway. So at the midpoint or so of the Parade. There is ""Free curbside seating is available on a first-come, first-served basis at three stretches along the parade route. People camp out for a spot as early as 12:00 Noon the day before the parade. Of course we didn't do that, but you don't really need to. It is very easy (although tight at times) to walk down the sidewalk, or stop and watch. You can see it ALL. Of course, if you're a serious viewer and you want a spot with a seat you'll want a ticket in the stands. But is it not needed. I got beautiful pictures, the walking gave us a good sense of the neighborhood and the people and there is wonderful street side vendors cooking fragrant food. Skip breakfast and buy on the street if you want a true taste of this event.4. Post Game. Here's my flub. We SHOULD HAVE gone to where they park the floats to get an up close look. I totally forgot about that. We got caught up in the end of parade scatter and needed to use the restroom and I'm hungry madness that kids always have. So we stayed around Old Pasadena (which is super adorable by the way, but not many stores are open on this crazy crowded day). Restaurants are. We went to Le Pain Quotidien, which is on Colorado (the parade street). Fresh bakery and sustainable food mission. Bathroom line was LONG, but we got a table in 20 min. Staff extremely nice. Highly recommend this kind of break in your day.5. Getting to the Stadium. Very easy, very walkable if you don't mind a bit of a hike. We walked from our brunch to the stadium. It's about a mile and a half. Just don't say that out loud to your kids because it is a fun walk and it sounds longer than if feels. There will be a lot of other doing the same, so pretty easy to just ""foliow the crowd"". You'll walk down a hill partly on sidewalk and partly down a well worn path. You'll see the Rose Bowl Stadium on the way down. Then through the ""tailgaters"" and to the entrance.6. Arriving at the Stadium. We had to stop for our Stubhub tickets, which was very easy and fast in the Arrival Tents. Enjoy this little moment of madness. You'll find yourself in Selfie, Family Pick and team game goods-land. Tons of people, lots to see and buy. My daughter wanted a Stanford scarf but don't buy it yet. You don't want to walk in with a bag... there are many vendors inside the stadium as well. Prior to entering the stadium-- Don't carry bags. We didn't have anything other than wallets (mine was a small clutch). This is IMPORTANT because the line to get in for no bags is much, much shorter than bag check.7. Inside the Stadium. Everything was perfect. So many vendors and bathrooms that there were no lines. We were on the East side so we had sunshine, bring sunglasses. We were in the lower seats around the 30 yard line...near that controversial stanford band! Great seats and sunny. Remember to look and make sure you are sitting with your team. When you buy your tickets make sure you buy correctly. The poor Iowa fans on our side were outnumbered for sure. You will find pins, hats, tee shirts, etc all available for you as well as lots of food, beer and soda. Typical football game but a bit more ""snappy"".8. Post game. We hiked back out to Old Pasadena. Yes, you are now going UP, but it's easy if you don't mind a little huffing and puffing from the kids and you're in decent shape. It will be dark, but again you are not alone. Use your smartphone flashlight. We wanted to eat at Urth which is on the opposite side of Pasadena, but we walked it anyway. 2+ miles. You could get the shuttle by the stadium (very longggggg line). Or grab a taxi once you hike up (we're too cheap for that). We just walked. Dress in layers, it was chilly if you didn't have a jacket.9. Back to LA! We could have metro'd but we Ubered. It was $27 to Uber back to our hotel. No big deal and then we didn't have to worry about the Little Tokyo neighborhood issues. Again, nothing bad, just a lot of folks down on their luck.10. Getting home. We flew out the next day out of LAX. No checked bags so we traveled light.So GO. It was fun. Best if you can stay in Pasadena and enjoy the shopping. They had all the favorites on Colorado that are probably open prior to game day. So glad we went.",Goally

Our coach bus brought us to the stadium early enough so that there were not long lines to enter or go through security. We had a great box lunch on the bus; so no need to buy food at the game. Our seats were on the lower level on the side near the end zone. There are extra Al Brooks employees outside the stadium to help you find your way in and back to the bus. The bus was parked near by and was able to leave fairly soon. Hotel and sightseeing are all part of the tour package that has many options.,dmmoger
40,Nice Stadium. Get there early to get through security,"We went to the Tournament of Roses Parade- very fun! Bleacher seats were nice, but the road--level seats had better views. We opted for the reserved seats so we didn't have to spend the night on the sidewalk. The game was fun, but took about 50 minutes to get through security. That part was disorganized.",Debbie K
40,Great atmosphere in a beautiful setting,"This stadium is dated and lines are long. They also have issues with entering the stadium that create an unbelievable wait to get inside. The beauty is in the atmosphere, weather, and tailgating location (mountain view).",windowguy1
50,Amazing Rose Bowl Game,"We attended the 102nd Rose Bowl game and what an experience. We walked from the Rose Parade to the stadium and it wasn't a bad walk. Since many people do this, it seemed that driving up to the stadium would take a while and when the game was over, people who parked at the stadium had to deal with thousands of people walking down the main streets and it was difficult for them to get out. Once we arrived at the stadium, everything was set up very well. The food was amazing in the tailgating area and the vendors had a lot for people to do while they waited for the game to start. Security was fast and got a lot of people through quickly. The gates were clearly marked and the bathrooms clean. It was a great experience.",Vanessa W
20,Major Updates Needed,"While I realize this is cherished grounds for college football and has great tradition, this stadium is a dump. It took almost an hour to get in the gate, 1/2 hour every time wanted a beer or food or use bathroom. If the tunnel was half full they would close it. I am sure it was great 50 years ago but it is terrible place to watch a game now.",exacta123
50,First time to attend the Rose Bowl,"Great experience but the Iowa Hawkeyes lost...😞😓. And, as long as you leave early enough the traffic wasn't as bad as one may think. Unfortunately, I can say if you leave early the traffic wasn't bad... Yea, that's how bad the Hawkeyes got whooped...😢",Michael S
30,"Beautiful Location , Lots of Waiting in Line","Love the location among the mountains and part of town, logistics need work spent about an hour trying to get in to the game (rosebowl). Sight lines were better than anticipated. We're were at the top end zone and still felt a part of the game.",MnHawk
20,"Beautiful Venue for Football, but Bench Seating is Outdated","Stunning view of nearby mountains. Shuttle from the Gold Line is very well-organized, and moves people as quickly as a bus bridge can.Bench seating rows are very close together, and narrow aisles to the concourse quickly bottleneck. At the end of a high-attendance event, you feel like people have crawled over you for three hours.They do have a pretty wide variety of concessions.You can somewhat mitigate the limitations with a game plan. Get your food / drinks early, and find your seats before the aisles back up. Plan your concourse visits to avoid ends of quarters.",Doug S
50,"The Sacred ""Old Granddy"" of all Football Stadiums...","Still a wonder, the first and only Stadium build expressly for the new fanged game of American Football..and still the best in my opinion...Mostly because it has never been prostiuted to sky boxes and commercialism, and the setting is unparalleled anywhere. I have been attending all kinds of events there for over 60 years and never been disappointed by the Statium, Concerts, July 4th Extravaganzas, Boy Scout Jamborees, Swap Meets and you name it,...Parking might be a little different, but it works on the Golf Course next door, and the seats have been upgraded, but the setting is so nice on a hot summer night..or even on New Year's Day...The perfect example of Yogi's ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it""...Let's just hope they never do...",Aston B

40,Wanted to see this famous stadium,"Stopped by since we were passing by on a near-by highway, wasn't going to not at least stop to see one of the most famous stadiums in the United States. Beautiful exterior surrounded by palm trees. Worth the side-trip.",Oldguitarmike

50,Classic stadium,In town on business decided to mix in an little fun and it was. The Rose Bowl is a classic. Great game amazing staff very friendly to out now state visitors. I would go back again in a minute. Be prepared to wait to get in security very tight but I would rather have the extra security and be safe and have fun.,James S
40,Rose Bowl Experience,"This is a classic football stadium with a lot of history. The location is without equal being in close proximity to golf courses, tennis courts, world-class swim stadium and the San Gabriel Mountains. The stadium's loud speakers can be somewhat loud to those with sensitive hearing!!",lilboku
20,"Great to see, but lot of fences and no entrance",In the LA area and wanted to see this historic facility. Unfortunately the day we arrived they were setting up for a flea market so it was closed and we could not get in. Lots of fences around it as well so really all we could see was the front gate. Very cool to actually see this in person but disappointed to just basically stand in the parking lot and take photos. Maybe check ahead if it is open for tours before you make the trip.,Robert W
50,Home of the Rose Bowl Game - Enjoyed Goilingng to the Cal vs UCLA Game,"We went to the Cal Berkeley vs. UCLA game (UCLA Game). We had a good time. The fly over of the 2 military jets was impressive during the Star Spangled Banner.We liked watching the game. It was the 2nd Thursday night football game for UCLA. There was a special half time show with some of the cast members from the Las Vegas MGM show KA.We enjoyed watching the game, but it was a bit lopsided with UCLA winning and looking the most impressive. Final score was UCLA 40; Cal 24.We stayed at the Courtyard Marriott so took the Old Pasadena shuttle, which is free, to the game. It is a very convenient location with lots of parking. The line to get on the bus to the game was ""short"". The line at the end of the game was long - but it moves along very nicely.There is a variety of food vendors at the game.Seating was good to see the game.We have visited the Rose Bowl a number of times, so this was a repeat visit.The only thing odd about the game is that most universities have a football stadium on the campus, the UCLA students and alumni are willing to continue for years to drive all the way from Westside of LA to Pasadena. Happy they do, but did want to note.",mini
50,Soccer Fun,"Got to go see a huge soccer game here with 93,000 of my closest friends. The stadium did a great job of handling the crowd, and I don't think there was a bad seat in the house.Concession prices were awfully high, as is expected at all stadiums.",jrpaine
40,Awesome tailgate,"We attended the US-Mexico CONCACAF Cup soccer game here. As an older stadium, the food and restroom facilities inside are pretty limited, but the tailgate and activities outside before the game were excellent. There was lots of room for tailgating and thousands of people just having a good time.",Marvin C

40,"Rose bowl go see it,awesome.","So much history there it was a great experience being there to watch the BYU / UCLA Football game. Seating was a little tight but was not to bad. The parking on the stadium grounds is filled first and then on the golf course parking. Which is not that bad if you get there early a short walk required. You can bring in some small snacks and sealed water bottles and your own stadium chair if you want. Surprisingly it was so layed back. The bowl holds over 92,000 so be patient.After the game it's a mad house but everyone was pretty good and courteous. The traffic is controlled pretty good. So go and have a good time.",dfacer
40,Old cement has soaked up lots of history!,"I've attended many UCLA football games over the years. Be prepared with a hat and sunblock if you attend a day game. Many food vendors with a wide variety of treats! Getting out of the parking lot at the end of an event can be a pain - go with a group of friends in a motor home, as you get to park along the street west of the golf course, giving you a straight shot out of the bowl!",Lee T

40,Another landmark stadium to check out,"I've been here a few times. I've hiked around here, watched the fireworks on 4th of July, and went to flea market days on 2nd Sundays of the month twice. The one thing I have not done; is watch an actual game here. There's tons of parking here. If you go to watch the fireworks, I would recommend parking on the street because you could get stuck for over an hour. If you come here for the swap meet (recommended) the earlier you get there, the better parking (free) you get. I loved buying old books and finding good furniture to rehab so you may love this place if you're also into that.",Ligaya72
20,Great fireword,"This review is for July 4th Fireworks event at Rose Bowl.1. Fireworks: EXCELLENT!! Still the BEST Fireworks in LA. Every year has different creative presentation.2. Parking: FWY 134 E, off ramp is back up on the freeway already. It took over 45 minutes to get in the parking lot after exiting the freeway. Only 2 staffs (lines) to pay the parking fee and have to merge into only one line to get into the parking lot. Many staffs are inside the parking lot ready to direct the traffic but the parking entrance is taking way too much time. Maybe should consider to open up more lines or entrance for people to get into the parking lot.3. Food Vendors: After get in the stadium, food is always the next thing come to mind. The food vendor at the front gate is very disorganized. There is no assembly line for preparing the food. The cashiers are yelling out the orders but no clear communication with the staffs who are preparing the food. In addition, the food quality is awful and way over priced!!Since there is no sign stating there are other food vendors in front of other gates, people all waiting in long line at this particular food vendor which is right after entering the main entrance. Maybe should have sign giving directions to other food vendors. It also helps to spread out the crowd.4. Staffs: Inside the stadium, many staffs wearing yellow uniform to assist. They make it so much easier to find the seats. Great job!!",ILoveFoodComa
40,Neighborhood attraction,"I've lived around the Rose Bowl for over ten years. There are so many fun things to do there: exercise (run/walk the loop), football games, concerts, 4rth of July and on and on. Inside the stadium is quite old. The bench seating is horrible so if you can upgrade to an actual seat it's highly worth it. Flea market is usually crowded and hot so go early. Football game days parking is tough especially to leave the stadium. Recommend parking in Old Town and taking the free shuttle. Trust me you will be glad you did. I've waited up to 2 hours just to be able to move my vehicle - this was before I moved here and can now walk home.",19Rebecca98
50,"Great Stadium, nice crowd","I visited because I was in town on vacation and this place is famous and highly ranked compared to other college stadiums. About 70,000 fans showed up and the weather was perfect. From what I could tell, any seat is a good spot to catch the game. The concessions are pretty pricy, but there is good selection. I would definitely go back.",Caleb K
40,Local Perspective: Depends,"I am what you would call, ""a local"" to the Rose Bowl and for years I've boot-camped inside, on the stairs from 8:30 to 9:30 on M, W & Friday. I've also attended the flea market, many concerts, events and games here. I know from experience there are those who want to just see the gates, that this place means something to them and their team and for that reason, my review of the stadium is: It depends! Should you go to a game here? Sure, why not! Should you go to a concert? Sure, why not? Flea market is also fun, but go early. Want to exercise while in town? Do the loop? Have kids, go to the KidSpace museum... The thing about this place is it's something different to everyone, it's a stadium, a blank slate and it's gonna be anything you want it to be.",CAZADOR
50,Flea Market heaven!,"I've been wanting to go to this event for a long time and it did not disappoint! It is so large that I don't think you can fit the whole thing in in one day though. There are many food vendors as well.HINTS: bring your own water as it is $5 a bottle there, also take some kind of backpack or cart as it is easier to haul things around!Can't wait to go back for a game too. The stadium is actually open for viewing and there is an electric energy in it even when it is empty!",SunnygirlC
40,Something You Have to experience At Least Once!,We went to the Rose Bowl Flea Market and you can find just about anything you want and probably a few things you didn't really need! It is by far the biggest market we've ever been to. Long lines to even get into the parking lot and you could spend all day there. We did walk up and look down into the stadium. One of our disappointments was the lack of food choices.,mgalex
30,Really Cool to see in person,"We had a little time to kill in Pasadena and this was worth sticking into google maps to take a quick drive around the Rose Bowl.

You can walk and walk and walk....AND I always find great deals! It is so enormous that it is impossible to finish walking around the entirety of the place, so it is best to saunter around and soak in the variety of items for sale.I enjoy talking to the endless venders about their unique products and this swap meet has EVERYTHING from one of a kind items, brand new items as well as used or vintage items, which includes clothing.

50,Epic,"Even in the BCS era, there are few games that rival the Rose Bowl. I've been to four of them and you really cannot beat the atmosphere. Due to the configuration of the seats, there is not a bad seat in the house.

We parked on the golf course about a mile walk in. Our seats were row 76. Once I got up there I couldn't get down for anything. Husband missed half the concert standing in line for beer and water and ID checks...he's 54. But all in all, great time.... Until the 3 young chicks started puking all over right next to us. Maybe more common sense with the ID checks.",Gerrie M

Wear sensible shoes and sunscreen or better yet, buy an umbrella from one of the stalls as it gets incredibly hot. Start early and bring cash. Some vendors do take credit cards, but prefer cash. ATM is in front of entrance. We had a great time! Vendors are willing to bargain so don't hesitiate to negociate. You are guaranteed to find a treasure for your home!",Brooke N

50,Great place for a corporate event!,"Being a corporate meeting planner in the medical device field, it takes a lot of time and research to find the perfect venue for a meeting. Most planners just book event space at a hotel, but I like to find unique places that attendees will remember. Rose Bowl Stadium is one of those unique places and is also a National Historic Landmark.Wolfgang Puck Catering and Legends Hospitality have teamed up with the Rose Bowl to provide restaurant-style experience with handcrafted seasonal menus and attentive, approachable hospitality. Our tasting tour began in the Terry Donahue Pavilion in the Loge Lounge.

Peach-infused lemonade served in Ball Mason Jars are also a fun, refreshing way to celebrate.In the Locker Room, you can have a casino setup for fundraising or friendly competition during an event. Excitement always seems to be in the air when numbers are hit on the roulette wheel or rolled on the craps table. Winner!The Rose Gardens, next to the field, can be setup banquet style for dinners or wedding receptions with sweeping views of the stadium. Passed hors d'oeuvres and champagne can be served during the reception: Tuna Tartare encased in a sesame wafer and topped with tobiko and green onion; fresh shucked oysters by Oysters XO; and/or mini lobster rolls on squid ink bread.The field can also be setup for corporate events with team-building activities that can inspire competitiveness, communication, and teamwork within your organization.",OCFoodDiva
20,I can tell you where not to sit. I would be ok never going to the Rose Bowl again.,"The Rose Bowl is a massive stadium, but it is old. Huge open stadium with little relief from the sun. The big screen is not big enough.Rose Bowl has actual seats in the muddle of the stadium and benches on the end. The benches do not have backs....very, very uncomfotable to sit for hours.If you are sitting on the end (section 27, 26), you will have a view of the big screen. The opposite end does not have a big screen view.If you chose the end seats, I recommend picking seats on the upper half. The lower half will likely make you stand the whole time as the bottom seats dont have a view, so the fans are forced to stand causing the whole section to stand. This applies to 27h section.Also, we were in 27h row J and this was 5 up from the bottom. Normally, you would J is higher, but not for the soccer game we attended.For the Galaxy vs Barcelona game, both soccer teams came out of the tunnel opposite of section 27, same side as the suites. Important if you want to try and get signatures.Everything costs $8 to eat and drink. Bring lots of cash.Rose Bowl did not allow soccer balls, selfie sticks, and water containers in the stadium. They could be checked in.Parking is horrible. Expect to arrive at least 2 to 3 hours early. Expect for it to take 1 hour to leave the stadium once you get your car. $30 to park on site.",ALinCA5512
40,A Nice Stadium,"The Rose Bowl Stadium is a nice venue to watch a sports event. Good viewing of the field no matter where you are sitting. There are individual seats with armrests, but the rows are quite narrow. There are also numerous food vendors both inside and outside the venue, although sitting areas for eating are few. At the recent LA Galaxy vs FC Barcelona soccer game, stadium was filled with over 93,000 in attendance. As a result, parking is a challenge. Even taking the free shuttle to the nearby parking lot results in HUGE waiting lines for the buses. Arriving early is definitely your best bet. Overall, Recommended!",Robert V

20,"Built for short people, and it's warm","These seats have NO LEG ROOM. And yet the steps are quite tall. Dress cool-it's very close quarters and the crowd will keep you nice and warm, regardless of temperature.There are insufficient entry and exit points for the size crowd. the rows are 100 seats long, so there are always people passing in front of you (or you're stepping over them. It's really a no-win situation.) Parking is on grass, with no signs, so you darn well better take a photo with your cell phone in several directions so you can find your car (or geo-tag it in GPS).On the Plus Side: lots of restrooms and well-lighted.

But the bleacher seats are very uncomfortable, the restrooms are too few and too small (especially compared with the L.A. Memorial Coliseum), and the parking situation is a logistical, log-jammed and gridlocked nightmare.",TrojanSkyCop1
30,The granddaddy of them all,We were in town and wanted to drive to see the stadium. We had to drive across town and arrived at the parking lot.

50,Heaven for Flea Market Fans,"This is a life-time treat if you are into finding bargains, locating unusual merchandise, strolling through crowds of people on beautiful sunny days, or simply want to do some people watching. Open from 9:00AM-3:00PM the 2nd Sunday of the month, you will have plenty of time to explore (obviously, the later in the day you go the hotter it is). Wear a hat and sun screen, even in the winter. To get a decent parking spot, show up early. Parking is free in some lots with fee paid valet service available until they are sold out.The size of this extravagant event is a bit overwhelming at first and I can guarantee you can get lost easily so bring your cell phone to communicate with others who may have joined you -- keep an eye on the Rose Bowl to help you get your bearings. You will also notice that there are addresses painted in the pavement in front of each merchant. This will help you find a booth if you want to come back.Bring something to carry things in. Most vendors have bags but it is good to have something you can throw on your shoulder. A lot of serious buyers also have carts. Bring cash, most vendors we bought from do not take credit cards. It is a good bargaining chip for those vendors who do take credit cards.Warning, bring a bottle of water, they cost $3.00 each on site.",Linda F
30,id pass on this stadium,"I love the grounds and history of this place. It is one of those very few places that can elicit great feeling, a sense of history, that is bigger than itself, let alone hosts many wonderful events.I have been here to see football, olympic soccer and other sports, fireworks, concerts, car shows, etc. If you can host it in a stadium, it has been here. Let alone for college football this place is one of the Holy Grails. It is associated with the perfection of Southern California. Great great things have occurred on the Rose Bowls Gridiron!PRO TIP: There is a nice running path around the stadium for jogging/walking.Freeway access is very simple as this is at the junction of the 210, 134, and northen part of the 110 after the break in South Pasadena. Its location in Pasadena is near the Old Town. Thus it is close to a lot of bars, restaurants, and shopping. What a great location IMHO...Now what I dislike about this place. The parking lots are on the surrounding golf courses and tailgating is allowed on a minimal basis. This to me really sucks. I always want to tailgate much more than is allowed. The bathrooms are horrible. For both men and women the facilities are sub par.Now the part that scares me about this place, if there is ever an emergency at the stadium or if some kind of bad event occurs here, then a lot of people will be hurt and or killed in the resulting exodus. The stadium has only one set of tunnels around it that flow only one way at a time. This shows the potential to great catastrophe if there was a bad earthquake or other type of disaster. I truly think that this place needs to be overhauled and another set of tunnels installed, or perhaps stairs over the top.Consequently, its a beautiful view in the arroyo-seco especially because it is USC's second home.",Schel74

I wouldn't want to do it every month if I lived there, but it's certainly something I'd do two or three times each year.Check it out...",sox1fan
50,"Beautiful, whether you like sports or not","It's kind of like Pebble Beach here. Whether or not you appreciate the sports played at this venue, it's difficult to deny the amazing beauty of the place. I got to take a tour of the Rose Bowl. I heard they are ending soon. But we went on the field, in the press box, luxury suites and locker rooms. Just lovely to see the mountains surrounding the valley of this epic stadium.",RTWtraveler213

50,The finest football stadium anywhere,"There is no better place to spend New Year's Day than in a seat somewhere in this amazing venue. When the sun sets, putting a pink hue on the San Gabriel Mountains, you'll swear, much like Shoeless Joe Jackson in Field of Dreams, that you were in Heaven. I can't speak to what the stadium is like on non-game days, but if you are in town and have a chance to take in the history and splendor of the Rose Bowl Game (presented by Northwestern Mutual), spend what it costs and get yourself a seat.",runningcoachg

50,Free tours during the off season,"Most people go to the Rose Bowl for football games, which makes sense. Those are great. During the off season, the Rose Bowl gives free tours where you can go into the press box, to the field (not on it), in the locker rooms. Being a guest inside gives a different feel, and greater appreciation for the place.",msa23_2000
40,Grand Daddy!,"The Rose Bowl Stadium and surrounding land is an athletes heaven! Besides firwork shows, concerts and classic world class soccer and football games inside there are great things happening in the surrounding fields, parking lots and streets outside. Today I observed a gigantic snowboard ramp & jump. The Amazing Race started in the parking lot which is also known for a flee market and RV sales. Soccer is very popular on the fields where I have also played softball games. Two Olympic pools, a baseball stadium, golf course, Rose Parade Float pavilion / archery range and the Kids Space Museum are located in the parking area. One day I watched the US Men's tandem Olympic diving trials in one pool. Hundreds of walkers, runners and bike riders circle the Rose Bowl on the streets every day. This is the Grand Daddy of the bowls!",James W

40,Rose Bowl 2015,"First time here - went with friends - bought tickets on stub hub, luckily places on the Oregon side. Really interesting stadium, almost 100 years old, some upgrades, but old school (no seats, only benches). They do have some upgrades and while the bathrooms were a problem, they apparently added a lot more capacity. We enjoyed the game and I would go back again if I have the opportunity",David M
50,Must go!,"I had the opportunity to join my Alumni group this year at the Rose Bowl. Getting into the stadium was a pain so be sure to get your drinks, food and potty break done before you stand in line because it is very slow moving to make it thru the gates. Arrive early. Once inside you have to wait again to get through the tunnels to where the seats are. Again potty break, food and drink before you find your seat ... but maybe not too much drink because a round trip from your seat could take 30 to 40 minutes. Once you get settled in your seats it is amazing. The field seems so close. Ti was the best game ever ... but ... we did win which contributes to the experience. Read the rules before you go of what you can and can not take into the stadium and remember it can get cold when the sun goes down.",Margaret U

30,Beautiful Stadium Setting,"We attended the College Playoff Rose Bowl--Ducks Vs Seminoles. This is a very nice stadium with ample parking and location. However, the prices for food and drink at the stadium are outrageous. I don't mind paying a little more because of an event venue, but $14 for a beer (Coors at that) and highly inflated fast-food items are bordering on stealing. Imagine... almost $100 for a six-pack.

30,Grand Old Football Stadium,"We went to the New Year's Day game at the Rosebowl and the event itself was wonderful. If you are just in town and want to take a tour, do it that portion I would rate 5 stars. If you are attending a game here think it through before you buy your tickets. If you sit on the east side of the stadium for an afternoon(Florida side) during playoff game you are looking into the sun for over half of the game. Great if you want to warm up, bad if you want to watch football. The Stadium is beautiful, perserved nicely for being almost 100 years old and the field is like looking at a painting, just perfect. Okay now for the bad. The concession stands are a joke, we waited in line for all of half time for a hot dog and a drink. The restrooms also are a joke, there are too few to acomodate 90,000 people so they have workers telling you to abandon the line and go to the porto potties. The Rose Bowl staff needs to wake up, if your stadium holds that many people you have to plan to serve that many people. It seemed to us like they were overwhelmed and that included getting into the stadium, getting through the tunnels to get to your seats and providing basic services like food/drink. Speaking of which I realize that they have to charge lots of money for a bottle of water, but here's a thought on a crisp January day I don't need a 24 ounce bottle of water. It didn't fit under my seat and of our group most knocked theirs over spilling out the $8 contents all over the ground. Charge me the same amount for something that fits under my seat and I will be happy. Make your lines more efficient and I will be more happy. People don't mind paying top dollar to go to a venue like this, but make sure your service fits the price charged. At the end of the day I would go back again next year and the year after I just hope they improve their offering.",randys101
40,Great tour,"Took the tour of the famed Rose Bowl and it was worth the price of admission to get to go to press box, locker rooms, and yes, get on the field! The tour guide Perry was EXCELLENT and very knowledgable on the history of the venue and the city of Pasadena. I loved the visit and the pics I got. Now to get to a game here!",rockstar89
50,I thought I hated football!,"This place was absolutely the best! We had the suite and I don't think I can sit in a regular seat again. We also had parking pass which came incredibly handy as parking can be quit a distance. Upon arriving at the stadium we were welcomed by stadium employees and every time we encountered an employee on the walk up the numerous flights of stairs there would be an employee there welcoming us to the stadium. Employees dress professionally and all are eager to assist you with a smile. Once in the suite we had a spread of wonderful Wolfgang Puck dishes and beer, wine, and soft drinks. The suite has a couple of TV's and is sound proof.When you open the door to go to the stadium seats you can literally feel the crowds energy and hear it too!!! The roar goes right through you. It was so exciting and the view of the mountains is spectacular. For someone who doesn't like football I had one of the best times ever!!",MassTraveler2013

50,Fulfilling My Bucket List,"My business partner and I had talked about this for quite a while, we had a bridal and event floral company, but never had the time to go until we retired. It was worth the wait. Al Brooks Tours offered just what we wanted, a flower centric tour. The Red Rose Tour offered in 2 days what we wanted to see. The float barns, a tour of the highlights of LA and Hollywood, the parade, a lunch and back to Pasadena for another up close look at the fabulous floats. We were on our own at night and as I'm an Open Table and Trip Advisor fanatic, we found just what we wanted for our dinners. There were four of us traveling and we were all thrilled with the attention to detail the Al Brooks group gave to this attraction. From the Marriott, decked out with vendors etc. all having Rose Bowl stuff, to the Al Brooks guides ready to give us info, badges, tickets It was fabulous. We even were given whoopee cushions for our tushies at the parade, boy did we need them, it was very cold. We could not have had a better time, I really am so happy we were able to do this. It was one of the most beautiful events I've ever been to, and there have been a lot in my lifetime but none quite so wonderful. Thank you Al Brooks Tours and Trip Advisor, where I found them.",LTG1938
50,Tournament of Roses Parade wasn't on our bucket list . . . but should have been,"Was the 2015 Rose Parade the coldest on record? A friend told me is was and I don't doubt it. My husband and I had on five layers of clothing (including two coats). We sat on our NASA blanket and covered up with another, but the minute our granddaughter's Blue Springs High School Golden Regiment band rounded the corner and began marching down Colorado, it was all worth it. The parade was fantastic. Japanese Green band was amazing. Floats were beautiful, but expected to smell them and didn't. Loved the stealth flyover, the blimp and skywriters puffing out Happy New Year 2015. Our seats couldn't have been better. We were in the grandstand and could see everything . . . coming and going. Gateway planned our entire trip and purchased the Sharp Seating seats that I would have purchased had we traveled on our own, but it was so nice not to worry about transportation. I'd rather walk a few blocks to a motor coach and let someone else drive in that traffic than do it ourselves. If the parade isn't on your bucket list, put it there. You won't regret it . . . even if it's freezing.",Marsha G
50,Rose Bowl Parade Tour,"We went on a 5 day trip with Colette Tour Company. It was well organized with not to many activities put into it. Travel day was Monday, Tuesday we went to two warehouses where they were busy preparing the floats for Thursday. After viewing the floats, we went to a Band Fest. Six bands who were marching in the parade performed. Wednesday was on our own and Thursday we were in our assigned seats watching the parade. It was wonderful,We stayed in the Westin Hotel in Long Beach, CA. Very, very nice. The beds were so comfortable.",Margaret B

50,Rose Bowl PARADE__Do Go__Best Seats Seats,"Don't know if you attended yet but one company Sharp Seating has a monopoly on all seats. We attended Jan 2015. We purchased our tickets 6 months in advance (Section 150 on S. Orange St) We got there and read this is the ""formation area"" and wouldn't see all participants. AND, the eats were were blocked by trees (15-25' tall with leaves), street poles, and palm trees with only 20' between each.. We were furious. Drove to Sharp's office and they reluctantly exchanged them (at $19 restocking fee per ticket) for seats on the Highway Overpass (Section 235) with NOTHING blocking the view, great sun on the entire float for good photography. Section 240 is better as sun is at your back. If you get to seat by 7:15, you'll be fine. You should look at stands and Google, some bleachers on the route are blocked by buildings flanking them meaning you can only see floats when they are directly in front. Nearly all had trees and lamp posts in front of them. This parade is 5.5 miles long so there are lots of spots to camp out on the street overnight if you'd like. However, it was 30 degrees the night before. We found purchasing the parking pass $40 was helpful, just be sure to park by the exit. Lots of port-of-potties around too. Also, the bleacher seats are super tight so you are crammed in. Some of the bleachers look like they go up 60 rows, others just 5 rows. They are aluminum which means a cold bum, and the $10 seat pads at the float building site were much thicker and nicer than those sold for $15 at the parade itself.Would highly recommend working on the floats. We volunteered with Paradiso but also check out Fiesta Parade Floats, and Phoenix Floats. SIgn up online for a 4 hour shift. We ended up staying 10 hours we loved it so much. You really get to appreciate the floats up close. Lots of tasks so can sit or stand or climb. Paradiso was great if you wanted to change tasks or locations and they were a delight to work with. Both floats Zappos.com and Singpoli won awards too! The floats are view-able later that day and 2-3 days after for $10 in some parking lot. They are pieces of work. We opted not to do the football game but that's within walking distance.",SayCheese
50,A Football Fan's Bucket List Must-Do,"2nd time at the Rose Bowl. We learned much from our first visit - arrive early, enjoy the environment, tailgate a bit then begin your trek into the stadium 1 hour before kickoff. Despite a multi-million dollar makeover between our 2011 visit and our visit 1/1/15 for the Oregon/FSU College Football Playoff Semi-Final, access to the stadium is challenging. Public shuttles are a nightmare of waiting in a queue. This year we purchased on-site parking located on a public golf course north of the stadium. Tons of room and bit of a chore to get onto the freeways, but definitely the way to go. Once inside the stadium added port-a-potty's help with accessing rest rooms quickly despite 100,000 fans packing the place. Food and beverage always high at these events but decent quality. At the end of the day - watching the sunset on San Gabriel Mountains as the game enters the 4th quarter brings chills for any devout sports fan looking for those moments in time you will never forget.",Gshibb
20,"Rose Bowl....um, no!","We were so excited to see our first Rose Bowl game (although if we had a team playing, some of these issues might be a bit LESS important)....but it is hard to get in to the stadium itself (be prepared for driving detours, or a LOT of walking)....then a long line to get in to stadium entrance....but wait....then to get into the tunnel to get to your seat?...painfully long! We actually had people who were willing to pay to get in front of us in this line! We missed most of the 1st quarter, just standing in line. Then when we left (at half time), the men's bathroom line was ridiculous...who ever sees that? Usually it's the women's bathroom....not this time! You'd be better off watching on t.v. We did it....but wouldn't do it again.",MichelleandBob2013

Its true parking is a nightmare that's why i opted for the shuttle from Old Town.,griffids

20,A Logistical Nightmare!!,Have to go to the restroom? Better get there 45-50 minutes before you have to do your business because the lines are long! Was there for 2015 Rose Bowl game and was shocked at the nightmare involved to get something to eat or drink and use the facilities. At least one men's restroom was closed off due to flooding and the lines for the others were 120-200ft long! I understand the structure is very old but at least consider making additions regarding the number of restrooms! Stop spending money on renovating the press boxes and start spending money on more restrooms and concessions or you will lose fans! Food and drink also very expensive - I don't mind paying more because I know it's a sports venue but $12 for a cup of lemonade feels like I'm being gouged.,ileftfootprints
50,NO BETTER PLACE TO SPEND NEW YEAR'S DAY,"I attended the Oregon vs. Florida State College Football Playoff game on New Year's Day in 2015. The game was absolutely great. This historic venue tucked into the mountains is a stunning location for exciting sporting events. The tunnels are old, the food ain't great, but you get a sense of the past which adds to the charm. It holds over 100,000 fans and there really isn't a bad seat. I appreciate this place.",Jim A

I had to stand on one foot the entire game because there were bolts/rebar/metal protruding from the concrete below where I should be standing.

50,Iconic landmark doesn't disappoint,"If you have a chance to go to any function at the Rose Bowl -- do it. We went to a UCLA football game and had a wonderful experience.There are a lot of food choices and some of it quite tasty. But, as at all places like this, the prices are high, $8 for a bottle of water! you are allowed to take your own bottled water and light snacks into the stadium grounds.I say that with a cautionary note. The place (of course) was crowded but the people were cordial and there was no problem with this mass of eager fans. The walk from where we were told to park to the stadium was very long, at least a mile each way. But we followed the crowd and enjoyed the view -- especially of all of the paraphernalia people set up for tailgating. We even saw a small satellite dish attached to a huge flat screen TV at one family site.This was an experience to remember.NOTE: This was a noon game and we sat in the south bleachers protected from the sun by wonderful shade as were the people to the west of us. Those in the other parts of the stadium were in the hot sun, it was likely a lot less comfortable there.",Linda F

10,Brace yourself,Was here to see Beyoncé on the run tour. The fee for general parking is 40 dollars and you park yourself in the golf course. I already hate having to pay just to park. Thank goodness I parked in the residential area. Yes we walked 1.5 miles from the car to the venue but I saved 40 bucks and on top of that there was no hassle when we left. Our friends payed the 40 and we compared to see if it was true about how terrible parking was and while we were halfway home I get a text saying they're still trying to leave. I was hot n sweaty by the time I got to the car but it was worth it.Secondly. Watch out for the shady venders and make sure you buy only from venders with signs showing their prices because they will take advantage and charge you more. I bought a churro for 5 bucks from the vendor walking around and 20 minutes later the lady in front of me asks the next vender how much Churros are and he says 4 dollars. Are you kidding me ? So what if it's just 1 dollar I felt dupped.Seating is just terrible. If this is your first time like it was mine pray that you are sitting in actual stadium chairs. If you look on google maps all of the red seats are actual seats and everything else is just benches. Yes you heard me. Benches. Not even good benches. They have no back to them and you will have someone's knees up in your arms the whole time. Our backs were just aching after the concert. The benches each have numbers painted on them and believe me if your a thick person you will take up two seats. I saw two bigger ladies both take up 5 seats. I will post the picture so you can see how terrible it is.Food is over priced but that's just all concerts. Don't buy water bottles in the outside stands. They will take the cap off and throw it out. It's policy they say but if you buy water bottles inside the actual stadium they let you keep the cap. Weird. It makes no sense.Needles to say I will never ever in my life be back. This should be more of a bucket list item and even then prepare for disappointment and best case scenario you have a good time.Tip: do not buy any concert shirts if you want them. After the concert there will be all kinds of people trying to sell you knock offs for only 10 bucks and they look identical.Tip2: yes leave early ! They really aren't kidding about the terrible traffic situation. Be extra cautious when leaving. People get desperate and starting using the other lane driving toward oncoming cars.,Charlie_TinT

After sitting in the 95 degree sun for several hours, I was thrilled to walk outside to find some shade by the bridge. Had a lot of fun at the game but wouldn’t want to be a homeowner in the area. So glad I visited but once is enough!",StarLady99
40,Getting out of there is the only detraction,"I have been a UCLA season ticket holder for almost 30 years, so I am very familiar with the stadium on typical game days and for the Rose Bowl Game.It is a great venue. Sight lines are excellent. With the upgrades made in the last couple years, the in-stadium experience is outstanding. You can even get a cell signal now!For tailgating at a UCLA game, arrive 6-1/2 hours before the game and park in lot H to be ""where the action is"". Cheerleaders, bands, food options if you don't bring your own, plus the team walks by to come to the stadium. If you can't arrive that early, tailgate on the golf course north of the stadium. Bring your own food and drink because their aren't many food sellers there until you get really close to the stadium. The drawback for the golf course is it will take a long time to get out of there and onto a freeway. Lot H is a lot better for that.As for seating, between the goalposts you get an individual seat, behind the goalposts are bleacher style benches. You don't want to be too close to the field, because the bowl has a more gradual rise than other stadiums and all you will see are helmets over the sideline. Stay away from rows lower than 15.",misterjohnny
40,Iconic Venue for Football,An amazing view is just the beginning of your experience to the Rose Bowl. Sight lines in the stadium are superb. The amount of elevation change for the distance from the field is nearly perfect. When you are a few rows back from the action you are at the right elevation to see the players clearly without binoculars.The aisles are wide enough and the slope appropriate for easy access. Plenty of restrooms with easy access. A variety of food vendors are located in many public areas close to seating.Parking can be a challenge if you need to be close to the stadium. If you arrive late you may be parked on the golf course a long ways from the stadium to walk and there are no restrooms on the way to the stadium.,DuckvilleDude
30,Concert review 1D,"If you can purchase prepaid parking in advance, do it. It will save you money. If not it is $40. They had an event before the concert, Kiis picnic in the park, which started at 2, so they gave everyone who got there before 4p.m. a $10. discount off parking. I got there right before 2 and got to park in section H. It was only a couple rows in and a couple cars to the right of the parking entrance. Thought it would be pretty good for when it was time to leave, but getting out of there and up the street a little ways took about 40 minutes or longer. We waiting a little bit after the concert was over to leave too. Hoping some of the traffic would be gone already. Nope.So, I would either wait for a while until the crowd is gone or leave a little early before it ends if you don't want to be stuck even longer. Also, if your car has any problems overheating, it just might going up the street on the way out in the very slow, bumper to bumper, stop and go traffic. Bring cash with you. They have atm's all over, but they do not accept any cards to make purchases. Cash only. The atm fee if $3.95. Also, if you can eat before getting there, do it. Prices are pretty expensive. $8 for a large soda, no refill. They do give you a refill of ice though. $6 for a small bottle of Dasani water. About the same for a lemonade. If you are vegetarian or vegan, I would most definitely make sure to eat before. The only thing I found was french fries. They did have some chicken and rice bowls. I don't know if you can get them without the chicken, but they were $7, and I didn't want to pay that for just a bowl of rice. The best thing about going here is that there are bathrooms all over. Look to the right, bathrooms. Take a few steps and look to the left, bathrooms. The staff there were helpful and nice. All in all it was a pleasant experience. It's just so expensive, no vegetarian/vegan food and total traffic chaos getting out and up the street.",Phluffie
50,Bruins game,"Not a bad seat in the house, best part is autumn football in a great tailgate setting. Nice place to ride the back, grab a dog then head in for a game. People watching is great. Nothing like college football in So Cal in the fall",Mark S
40,The City of Roses,"Attended a football game. The stadium is not hard to find. Lots of signage and directions to the venue. It can be expensive. Parking lots can be crowded. On warm days, take water; it can get hot out there.The crowd was electric. While there are challenges with parking, the energy from the crowd is awesome. I would want to do it a lot of the time but it is a tremendous experience.",AJ S
50,ONE DIRECTION,Great sound great stadium and most of all great concert. The Pre- Concert party was fantastic also. Finding our seats was easy. Lots of helpful staff. My daughter left her camera and they helped her get it back.,965gingery
40,Nice but pricey.,"The arena itself is nice but it's very hard to get in and out of the parking lot. It's a long drive and the parking is $40!! My husband is in a wheelchair and they let us park close by. Unfortunately we saw many people park there, jump out of their cars and run in. The attendance say that they see that type of fraud all of the time but can't stop them. It was a One Direction concert so many teenagers were picked up by their parents. With the confusion of those cars plus those trying to leave, it held up the traffic even longer. We didn't get out until long after midnight. Luckily we were able to get through the arena entrance very quickly. I'm not sure how that happened because usually there's a long wait. Once we were in it was easy to find our seats.",Gina K
50,The Rose Bowl Flea Market is a must do!,"We had so much fun here, even with the heat at 100+ degrees on the day we visited. So much to see and so much to buy. Luckily we had checked an empty bag in anticipation of the shopping. Lots of seating and shade for breaks. We stayed 5 hours and maybe saw half of the market. I want to go back~",Nancyjanem
40,From the outside,"We didn't actually enter the stadium itself as we visited on a Monday (tours are offered twice a day at 10:30AM and 12:30PM, Thursday through Sunday), but the outside of the venue was beautiful. We spoke to security to see if we could a sneak peak around, which they said no to and even though I was bummed about it, I was impressed that they maintain protocol.If the outside is anything to go by, the stadium must be very nice.",quinni_224
50,Great Venue!,Visited the rose bowl taking the kids to the 1D concert. It is a very nice venue. We had upper level seats and they do a very good job with the screens to ensure every seat is a good seat. The staff was very friendly & helpful. For this particular show they had really good organization-parking was expensive but organized we had not issues getting in or out of the park. They had a ton of food vendors outside the stadium and inside. Food is expensive but they had a good variety to choose from. The sound was decent for an out door venue and it was nice that they had fireworks as a part of the show.,Larena C
50,One Direction,"Went to see One Direction's Where We Are Tour performance at the Rose Bowl Stadium. Our seats were perfect; the show was great! And I can't believe how easy and well organized they were at this venue. It was much easier to get in, park, enter the stadium, and to leave than I ever would have expected!",Jessica Luna Knight
20,Parking almost ruined my good experience,"Took kids 2 nights to One Direction. A Thursday and a Saturday. The Rose Bowl is a nice venue and seems to have been renovated since my last visit many years ago.The show was great and the kids loved it.The food is ridiculously overpriced. When purchasing an overpriced water bottle they remove the cap and won't let you have it indicating some people like to fill the bottles up, put the cap on and then throw it like a missle. Well I didn't want to drink my water right away so I had to walk around for an hour with two open bottles of water. I recommend smuggling in your own water or bringing your own caps. They sell the Dasani brand so make sure you have one of their caps so it fits.I don like they way there are so many seats in between the aisles. If your seats are mid row you have to crawl over about 25-30 people either way just to get out.Now for the parking. I know I had the option of parking in Pasadena and being shuttled in to the event but I heard the shuttle lines could take an hour or so so I did not want to do that. I got there at 330 pm and the gates opened at 500pm. I got right in to the golf course parking lot and was directed to pull face in against the netting next to the driving range. This was a mistake. I have a large SUV. I HIGHLY recommend anybody directed to park like this to back it in. After the show I was trying to leave and it was impossible to back out with the amount of people walking by and the cars that had already developed a line to get out. No cars moved for the first 45 minutes. It took over an hour to get out and this was on Thursday night when the crowd was the lightest.Their parking system is TERRIBLE. They need to hire someone who can come up with a better Game Plan than they have. There are lots of people directing you in and hardly anyone directing you out.On Saturday I did not go in to see the show, I just dropped off and went in to Old Town via shuttle and then came back to pick them up. I parked on the golf course but before the show was over, I moved my car near an exit. We got out in 5-10 minutes and saved about an hour of waiting.Lastly, they had a parents lounge at the Golf Club. It was $5 to enter and you could redeem the money inside as you were given a ticket to apply to your order. My wife paid for us while I was moving the car then when I arrived we went inside with the wrist bands we were given. We bought some drinks and realized the guy at the door never gave us our tickets. We went back out to let him know he didn't give us our tickets. He was rude and adamant he gave us the tickets. I don't know his name but he was working the door on Saturday night at about 9pm. He was a jerk.One last thing, If you go up the escalators that are just below the suits there are some concession stands up there that are less crowded. The water bottles were $1 cheaper and they didn't take the cap off and the food was slightly cheaper than the other concession stands below. Go figure?",kacnjmcsdad
10,Worst traffic control around,"This was our first & definitely our last experience for an event at the Rose Bowl. They do not know how to control traffic. It took forever to drop off our teens for the concert and trying to pick them up was a total nightmare. The Hollywood Bowl and Staples Center have it down. Pasadena police blocked off the exit we took to get to the Rose Bowl so we had to take next exit and back track only to find that you can't pick up where you dropped off. So we circled back out and tried to come in another way but they weren't allowing left hand turns. Then we ended up in Old Town Pasadena to make our way back into the almost 2 miles of crawling traffic. Finally we asked the girls to get somewhere where we could pick them up. They went to the Jack in the Box and though the exit was blocked where they were, we went to the next exit and back tracked (deja vous!) So, 2-1/2 hours later we connected with our teens. This is a terrible venue for traffic control. Something has got to change or they'll drive people away. We did see a house on the slow road to the Rose Bowl for sale. Guess they got fed up too!",lkstumm
40,Awesome venue,Wife and kids just went to 1 direction concert they loved it . Wifey said to park outside saves a lot of time and money . You will be doing a lot of walking. They sat in the back but it worked out since temperature was high and the got a breeze at top,Rchavoya
50,One Direction concert,First visit to the Rose Bowl Stadium to see One Direction. Great venue. Employees were extremely friendly and we loved the fireworks.,Patrice H
20,Not a place forconcerts,Took us two and a half hours to get to rose bowl to drop off grandkids for 1 direction concert saturday night . It was a zoo its like they have never had an event there very un organized the police blocked off the places that we dropped kids off. Kids had to walk over a mile to get to us at the jack in box on arroyo. Very annoying total un organized for drop off suggest park at venue and go to concert leave extra early if you go to a popular concert . Never will ho to another concert there,Tom H
50,One Direction Concert,Went to the On Direction concert on 9/11/14. The venue was perfect and event staff was friendly and helpful. Prices for drinks and food were way to expensive but over all a really nice place.,Trisha D
50,Historic and Beautiful,"We stopped by the Rose Bowl Stadium to visit and take pictures on a beautiful sunny day in Pasadena. They are just finishing up an extensive remodeling to the exterior of the Stadium and already its more spectacular. There's so much history here and as a football fan this place is second only to Canton Ohio for hallowed football ground. As a longtime Wisconsin Badger fan its a great place to visit. With the remodel, all the teams of the Big 10 and the Pac 10 are honored and listed. The beauty of the San Gabriel mountains in the background is even more breathtaking in person than it is on tv. Pasadena is a great town with wonderful people.",0221Serendipity
50,Great place for the Monster Tour,The Rosebowl was an awesome venue for the Eminem and Rihanna Monster Tour. It was very ncie watching a concert of a life time in the open air. The staff were awesome with helping us find our way around.,Leeza9
40,"Great place for a concert, just be patient when leaving.","This is a good place for a concert. The worst part was that the parking cost $60 and there was no one directing traffic. It took us over an hour to leave the parking lot, UGH",AZ85603
50,Best flea market ever,Arrive early and pay the extra $2 to get in at 8am - that way you get great parking and the crowd is less. The artists and craft people are around the stadium and then the paved parking lot is the flea market. No matter what you're looking for its here.,PPIEW7
40,Monster tour,"I went here for the Eminem concert that was at the rose bowl . The concert it self was great , the sound quality and pyrotechnics were awesome . However NOONE was directing people where to go for taxis . After asking someone who said he didn't know we started on out on our own , there were no signs to help . After 45 minutes we reached the taxi area to be told they were gone and were not letting any more in . We were told to walk to old Pasadena . After another hour and a half of walking we called uber . There were people literally sitting on the side of the road because they wouldn't allow taxis in nor could tell any one who to call or what to do . Parking was really unorganized , I wouldn't return if it's like that all the time . After a 3 hour concert I really don't like having to walk another 2 hours just for a ride home .",Kati C
50,Can't beat the Rose Bowl on Jan 1st,"Simply the best Bowl experience there is for college football. Have been to two bowl games and have thoroughly enjoyed the pre-game festivities surrounding the stadium and then the games themselves. A great venue, hope to be back someday.",Globalman2001
50,College Football and New Years Rose Parade - Nice Grounds,"We have gone to the Rose Bowl stadium several times to see collage football games. The stadium which seats 92,000 plus is in a neighborhood setting in Pasadena. The views from the seats we have had at the stadium have always been good.The stadium is also the site of the Rose Bowl game usually held either on New Years Day. We normally watch that game however on TV instead of go to the game.Parking for the games we have gone to has been a challenge. If one gets there early enough there is parking on the field where one can do some tail gating before the game.We have found however that staying in Pasadena at the Marriott Courtyard and walking across the street to the game bus shuttles is the easiest and best way to get to and from the game.The line moves quickly to get onto the buses - although at times especially at the end of the game, the line for the shuttle bus seems to be a very very long line.We also know people who go to the Rose Bowl area on non game days just to walk around the area for exercise.",mini
40,Pleasantly Surprised by the Rose Bowl,"I guess when you go to a concert at the Rose Bowl, you feel a certain sense of magic, of being special, because afterall, it is the Rose Bowl. But it still did not deter me from fairly reviewing the place, while thoroughly enjoying myself.I guess starting with the parking situation, we did not park there, but it seemed that there was a lot of it. I would recommend getting there early, and just know when you leave, it will take a lot of time to get away (lots of slow traffic getting out).The stadium itself is quite large, but extremely easy to navigate. There are large signs every where showing where to go. And each section has multiple bathrooms and food places. That was so amazing, as usually you go to these events and spend more time waiting in line then actually watching the events.The acoustics were great, which was pleasantly surprising. This was not my first outdoor show, but my first with such amazing sound. The energy at the show was so on point, everyone was there to have a good time, and the performers (Eminem and Rihanna) rewarded us in kind.The point is, I had an amazing time, until I left, that was a little hectic. I would recommend the venue to anyone, even with the cluster at the end.Thank you to the Rose Bowl!Always happy to answer questions if you have them...oh and if you need a cab check Limo Cab Company, they were absolutely amazing!!!!",Trulycraz13
10,Manchester United v LA Galaxy,"I drive with my daughter from Sacramento to LA for this game,after my daughter pay a very spencer price for the tickets. It took us 3 1/2 hours to get into the venue,arrive 1/2 into the game,is a complete disaster every time we was close to the entrance the highway patrol will arrive and close the exit from the freeway. Will never purchase another ticket to this venue. And in top of all the $30 for parking.",NancyF1
50,The Monster Tour,"Great concert venue. Good sound and staging + fireworks. Only problem was with over 100,000 people and no one was getting into the concert.",Altomatum
40,Quite Impressed with the Rose Bowl!,"After living in So. Cal. for 30 plus years I've been to almost every entertainment venue there is available but not the Rose Bowl. We went to see Eminem & Rihanna (tickets were $140.00 per) this past week and we were quite impressed with the staff, the venue and the facilities. I had received several emails to advise us to arrive early due to traffic congestion for this sold out show and we headed that advice. The Rose Bowl is located within a residential area, so think about it, can you imagine the chaos that could ensue when you add 60,000 people to your residential area? We arrived at Parson’s Engineering Parking area (pre-paid for $17.00) at 4:00 and waited until 5:00 to head over to the Rose Bowl. They had a pre-concert area set up with tables, food, beverages, music and there was ample space to mill around (people that brought their own food sat outside on the grass and had picnics). The doors opened at 5:30 so we got in line around 5:10PM and the venue opened right on time. We went through security without a hitch and got to our seats in no time (know the gate that your seats are nearest). We took in two LARGE water bottles manufactures seal intact (they allow you to take in a 2 liter beverage) this was a big saver for us as it was a hot day. We had bench seating just off the floor (pit) 14H row 5, these benches are concrete so I had brought a towel (another item you can bring in that I would suggest) we used to soothe our rear-ends. After the concert started around 7:30ish we never sat down. The cool evening breeze was wonderful. The restrooms were clean and functional and they kept the people moving in and out. There was security in yellow coats everywhere which doesn’t bother me a bit, I like it! We ate at two small places for a bacon wrapped hot dog and a burrito – both were ok. We left as Eminem was singing the last song, and got in line for the 2nd shuttle bus leaving the venue. Got to our car and out of Pasadena in a matter of 15 minutes. Had I been with my better half we probably would have stayed at the Marriott right by Parson’s I’ve stayed there before and it’s a nice location and not very expensive. I would return without hesitation to this venue.",Kathy A

50,Eminem and Rihanna Monster Tour,The Eminem and Rihanna monster tour were very good. We used the park and ride from Old Pasadena ( this was such a great idea).

40,Authentically old and cruddy....?,"Don't get me wrong, I love the place. For football games, dances, circuses and of course the Flea Market.

40,"Had higher expectations, for some reason...","Went to the Manchester United vs LA Galaxy match on July 23. The game did not disappoint...very entertaining, especially from ManU.This was my first visit to the Rose Bowl stadium, and so had extremely high expectations of the venue. Entrance grounds were beautiful, tailgating going on in the golf course turned parking lot. Stadium was large, though pretty typical. Had to wait in a large crowd to get in through the gates, watched VIP guests stroll on through while the rest of us averages stood sweating.Food/drinks were expensive, though on par with all other professional sporting venues or major attractions. Not sure why people always complain about parking and vending prices at events like this. Everything is always way overpriced, but consistently way overpriced. 20 oz draft beer was $10, large soda was $8, large popcorn was also $8.My family and I had a great time, lower bleacher seats between goal and corner post. Would definitely recommend going to a game or match at the stadium at least once. I just had lofty expectations because, let's face it, it IS the Rose Bowl stadium.",Stephen M

All and all there is something to do.",Neerav S

10,How to get bamboozled in Pasadena!,"I just finished a grueling day of selling at the world famous Pasadena Flea Market and what a disappointment it was….I ordered my space the first day that I could last month and spoke at length with a Flea Market sales associate about where I wanted to sell. I had a mixture of beautiful antique furniture,film props, memorabilia, Designer labeled wardrobe and jewelry. I have been going to the market for years, have sellers who are friends and know the Market very well, so I was very clear as to where was a good selling spot. After receiving my tickets for my booth, I called back and spoke to the associate again, saying, ""This is not where we talked about my booth being located ."" He assured me it was a high traffic, high demand site, that over the last month they re-arranged the market to and that this was where people would be entering and that he had done me a real favor by giving it to me for such a great price of $185.00. Complete and utter bollocks is what is was. Upon arriving, I was directed to my space by a teenage guy who was barely awake and wasn't really sure where it was but he ""thought it might be over in that direction."" I spent the first hour trying to find the spot asking six different lot attendants where the space was located and each time being given a really unclear description of where it might be. Finally, I just stopped my rented u-haul on the side and hiked back to the front where I did find a very helpful guy who knew exactly where my spot was located. He biked over to where my truck was and led me to the spot which was already surrounded by vendors so getting my truck in was like threading a needle blindfolded. The neighbors were very nice but knew I was new because I got the ""Crap Spot"" that management doles out to the new sellers. I was there at 530 am ready and did not see the first person come by until almost 8AM! During the whole day, maybe 40 people came past my booth. A lot of people took photos of what I had displayed using the props and wardrobe to style their photos but actual buyers were very few and far between. Unfortunately, there are some bad seeds who roam the market, running a con to distract sellers while their partner shoplifts. This happened to me and I never found any type of security to report it. I did speak with the manager of the office for vendors and she told me there was nothing she could or would do about my spot being misrepresented or any of the trouble I had. My vending neighbors said that management isn't ever helpful and security is done by one another vendor helping each other out, otherwise, you are ""on your own."" I did have one lovely woman named Dorothy come by around 8:30 am and was very appreciative of what I had to offer and I really loved her getting some very special pieces. Dorothy, I thank you because without you my day would have really been a complete bust. I barely broke even and the lack of care or support that the staff offered was beyond disappointing. Sellers be very aware of the lackluster care that is given by the management and expect to be ripped off. I am truly saddened by the experience and feel completely scammed.",Maryrocks33

They were doing some construction when we visit so it would have been better if they were completed but I still highly recommend this tour.",MichaelLong1963

40,Good but getting a bit ragged in terms of the quality of goods,I went late in the day so had some limited time and did the outside of the Rose Bowl. I found 3 outstanding vendors whose works I liked a lot in term of vintage but missed the collectible section. Around the outside it was a lot of goods that were not so hot. Items from china that were newer. Etc. Some good deals but get a map to be sure you do not miss the true vintage sections. It was a hot day this month and the lemonade sellers are not to be missed!!!! Plenty of bathrooms and food vendors!!,AuntTink
30,"Parking, Parking, Parking","Going to the Rose Bowl, for TravelinAlan, is all about parking. Not getting in, but getting out.Having been there many times, it is worth it to pay extra for some kind of preferred parking. It is easy to get trapped on the way out when there is a big crowd. I am not a fan of the extremely slow exit. Handicapped parking is very good.The public transportation option is ok to get there. Leaving will involve long lines to get on the transfer buses.As for the Rose Bowl itself, they have done some upgrading. However, the lines to use the toilets seem just as long as my first visit in 1959.",TravelinAlan
50,Rose bowl July 4th,"We have been twice to the Rosebowl fireworks display. Fabulous. Beautiful and LOTS of them. Once when we brought our dog, we couldn't go inside (which has a nominal fee for the show), but the display was beautiful from the parking lot. You can set up a tail gate BBQ for all day long if you want for free. Fun time. Bring lots of ice as it is hot!",ccatravel
40,Great job on the Rose Bowl 2014,"They did a great job putting on the Rose Bowl 2014. Tons of people, cars, you name it and all of it went smooth. If you want to see the rose parade before the game, buy tickets way in advance from a sales person on the phone who will help you pick out good seats.",California_Wine
20,Is this place safe?,"Atmosphere was AMAZING for the BCS National Championship. Traffic flow was a disaster. Very close to people being trampled because of poor traffic flow immediately following the game. Shuttles were a disaster, but its only a 2 mile walk to Old Pasadena. The tunnels getting in and out...how is that not a safety hazard?",STL Foodie
50,National championship check-off bucket list!!,"To watch a nationally televised game in the famous Rose Bowl stadium w/ 98, 402 crazy, screaming, Florida St/Auburn standing-room-from-the-beginning-to-the-end-of-the-game-fans, is just amazing! The atmosphere, real grass playing field, excellent view all around, my tix was on the FSU side on the 20-25 yrd line...just a great view to witness the winning drive and TD, baby!! Just as I was told it was exciting and tense to watch the game on t.v., of course it was the same feeling to see it live!! The rose bowl was the perfect venue for this championship game! Just to be able to appreciate the aura of the stadium and the surroundings was just the best!!",Albert C
40,UCLA Bruins Football Games,"As a UCLA Bruins fan, I attend most home football games at the Rose Bowl. I never have to deal with parking because of the convenient free shuttle from Parsons in Old Pasadena. I live close enough to walk to Parsons and avoid paying the $25 parking fee and traffic.As for the stadium...the new renovations are excellent. I only wish they would upgrade the seats and tunnels. During big games, they tunnels can be a little tricky to navigate with my toddler. The sightlines are excellent from nearly every seat in the stadium.",Willieboxing
10,Proud Ancient,"NAME: Rose BowlTITLE: Proud Antique (Tripadvisor 9 Feb 2014)PREGAME INFORMATION: The online information was scant and inadequate (see Beer below). They need to do a much better job of this. One could not sort information from previous venues because they were contradictory.TELEPHONE: +1 (626) 577-3100WEB PAGE: maps, transportation, parking, and policies http://www.tournamentofroses.com/2014VIZIOBCSNationalChampionship/GeneralInformation/GameDayGuide.aspxOWNERS: City of Pasedena. The facility is supposedly losing money, not even counting the renovations. 23_Rose_Bowl_90-2.pdfLOCALITY: 101 Rose Bowl Drive, Pasadena, CA 91103-2813DIFFICULTY LOCATING: Many tips and instructions are posted online. We arrived on a bus and; therefore, do not know.OCCASION: College Football National Championship Game 2014 (for 2013 season)CELL PHONE: Cell phone reception in and around the stadium was bad. We were trying to find a fried in the stadium. Our conversation was cut off and/or did not work repeatedly. Do not expect cell phone reception.PARKING: The location is unbelievably horrible and unsuited for a major bowl. It is surrounded by upscale residential areas and lacks adequate highway access. Patrons suffer terribly and long to get vehicles in and out. The “Rose Bowl” simply must be rebuilt somewhere convenient and accessible. They cannot even build adequate parking lots and must park vehicles on their golf courses. Parking fees: car $50 limousine $250, and bus $350.ENTANCE: The Rose Bowl has 8 gates [A-G, N (north)]. The gate closest to our seat was C. We arrived early, but there was still a mass crush of humanity.STAFF: I saw many complaints about them online, but they turned out to be polite, cordial, and efficient.VIEW: Spectacular view of park and mountains. Every seat in the stadium has an unobstructed view of the field, but since the seats have, an old fashion, low angle of incline, patrons are further away from the field than in modern stadiums.ATMOSPHERE: Mostly a mob scene. Sardines walking. Outside, inside, and everywhere. If you are the least claustrophobic, then forget it. You moved with the mass mob. You could not and did not wish to try and do anything except go to your seat and stay there. The inability of the stadium to handle crowds took a lot of fun out of the experience. Despite being jammed in unmercifully by the bad stadium, everyone was friendly and in good spirits. These fans were southerners on both sides, so good behavior was not surprising. [1]SUGGESTED ATTIRE: We needed light jackets before the game was over. The advanced weather forecast said cold and rain. Closer to the game this changed to cool and no rain. The revisions saved us carrying coats and ponchos. Check the forecasts to plan. Umbrellas are one of the items banned from the stadium.AIR-CONDITIONED: open airFURNITURE: Apparently, the old, uncomfortable benches have been replaced with comfortable seats with backs. However, we almost never got to use them because everyone was standing up most of the time. This was ridiculous since the seated view was just as good.BEER: NCAA rules prohibit the sale of alcohol at NCAA Championship events. However, there were 2 kinds of large cans of boring beer [2] being sold inside the stadium. [3] I tried, unsuccessfully, to learn online if beer and wine would be sold, but nothing official was posted.WINE: I did not see any. However, the crowd was packed in so tight that one could not exactly walk around the stadium.DRINKS: The Pirate smuggled in refilled airline bottles of rum and bourbon in his pockets. [4]WATER: Available for sale, but they remove the caps when they sell it. Bottles may be brought into the stadium, but must have the caps on. Go figure!FOOD ITEMS: We saw ordinary popcorn, hotdogs, and beers that brave souls risk their lives climbing down and up the stairs to obtain. Everyone said there were long lines at the stalls all the time; therefore, they are still insufficient. Supposedly, additional stalls, which were deferred during renovation, will be added later. I do not know where they will put them.Online advertisements list some interesting food items found in and around the stadium, but I did not see them. Most of the things listed online were ghastly Carnival Fat Foods. I might have been interested in trying the “catfish/shrimp & Cajun fries,” if it was not too hot and the almonds (a local product), if they did not ruin them with too much butter and salt. However, we were still too full and the mass crowds made shopping around impossible.All vendors, except Carl’s Jr., only accept cash. The ATM machines charge an excessive fee, there can be long lines to use them, and they are often empty or broken down.DANGER DOG: AKA Tijuana Dog, etc. This bacon-wrapped hotdog with long, large slices of cooked onions and bell pepper, ketchup, mustard, and lots of mayonnaise (usually a jalapeno pepper, also) is a tradition after the game. [5] We saw the rustic carts and my First Mate took pictures. Ironically, the Danger Dog is both the Official Hotdog of Los Angeles (Farmer John 2010) [2] and is illegal to sell in Los Angeles (2008). [6]VENDORS IN STANDS: None. Everyone was packed in too tightly, the rows were too long, and the aisles were too narrow for venders. This is more evidence that a modern stadium is needed.SHOWS: The pregame show featured a famous singer/composer, we had never heard of (does not do Pirate shanties) singing the national anthem. I tried to look up the half-time show online. I could not find it because there was none. Both bands played ancient songs. They sounded horrible because they were facing the TV cameras and away from us.BATHROOMS: The women’s bathroom at our gate had one stall and a long line of women waiting. The men’s had 8 stalls and 10 urinals, no waiting, and most of the stalls were empty. The designer must have hated his mother. The Pirate led his First Mate and another courageous woman in through the exit of the men’s bathroom and into 2 empty stalls on that end. Go before you get in the stands and avoid the half time and end-of-game rushes.SECURITY: There is a long list of things you cannot bring into the stadium. Check this online because the list changes. There were warnings of second lines for those carrying bags and delays. We carried a bag with our jackets and waters bottles. We were not sent to another line and the search was quick and cursory.CONDITION: It is not in bad shape and was clean before we messed it up. However, the design is too old fashion and cannot properly handle crowds. It is more lake a prison [7] than a stadium.RENNOVATIONS: There was a 3-year renovation, which was to be completed in 2013. Due to cost over runs, some badly needed additional restrooms and concession stands were deferred. They are spending millions of dollars putting Band-Aids on a patient that cannot be saved. They widen the tunnels a little, but not enough. The plan to add more concession stands will just make things more crowded! No proper access to parking or to the stadium can ever be accomplished. There can never be proper parking lots. These noble goals are just impossible. Please do not make all of these people suffer another 20 years. Face reality. Give up. Keep the historic landmark, but build a new modern stadium in a proper location.EXIT: Once you enter the Rose Bowl you can only leave once. If you go outside for any reason, then you cannot return. Leaving after the game was a truly horrible experience. This took forever. I was beginning to believe we would not make the hour deadline for our bus. I was sorry for those who took the shuttle. Their mass, not a line, but a gigantic, long mass, looked like it would take 2-3 hours of crushing mess.PROBLEMS: (A) The cement steps in the stadium are too steep and narrow. They are difficult and dangerous going up and more dangerous coming down. (B) The tunnels may have been expanded, but they are still too narrow to handle crowds of this size. (C) The isles and stairs were awash, ankle deep in trash, when we exited. This made everything much more dangerous. My First Mate stepped on a bottle and I had to grab her to keep her from falling. A sweet, young thing grabbed my arm when I almost fell. [8]REVIEWS AND RANKINGS: The reviews and rankings for this place, listed by many different organizations, can be misleading. They rank it as a park and exercise place (very good), as a flea market (very good), and as a historic landmark (excellent), but as a major stadium it is horrible. Even the Rose Bowl Parade was reviewed under the “Rose Bowl Stadium” topic. The booking agency, Al Brooks, was as incorrectly reviewed under this topic.SUMMATION: This is a nice historic landmark, but it is a horrible excuse for a stadium. The Rose Bowl must be rebuilt as a modern stadium in a good location. I always wanted to see the Rose Bowl, but I will not be back.HISTORY: The First Rose Bowl College Football Game was played in 1902. The series was begun in 1916. The stadium was constructed in 1921-1922. After losing to too many SEC Teams, the west coast team diminish the importance of the Rose Bowl game by agreeing to play “in house” in 1946. The last renovation was 2011-2013, but more is planned (only throwing good money after bad). http://www.rosebowlstadium.com/about/historyFootnotes[1] Ironic that 95,000 fans from the southeast had to go across the whole nation to see their game.[2] It was a shame to sell mass-produced beers when Pasadena has 6 fine, microbreweries. Coors Light (beer concession) and Farmer John (danger dogs) are Partners of the stadium.[3] I guess all the recent NCAA scandals and problems have demoted NCAA rules down to polite suggestions.[4] We had been at a rather disappointing (food wise) hospitality tent before the game. The Pirate had 7 good Gin and Tonics and the First Mate 3 Bourbon and Cokes.[5] We make a similar bacon-wrapped hotdog that my mother made. We are afraid to make an authentic “Danger Dog” for fear that the LA County Police will break down our door and arrest us! How can California not have Freedom of Hotdogs? The restaurant “Buffalo Wings” has a very similar hotdog on their menu (bacon-wrapped, cooked onions and bell pepper). The only things missing are mayonnaise (which could be supplied) and a jalapeno pepper. My First Mate puts mayonnaise on her hotdogs. I always told her no one puts mayonnaise on a hotdog, but I stand corrected.[6] Los Angeles made Danger Dogs illegal in 2008. They confiscated carts, threw away hotdogs [ugh!], and fined people and put them in jail (1 lady for 45 days), but could not make a dent in the business. People have been deported for selling a Danger Dog! Seems silly to arrest people over hotdogs? This seems embarrassing for the police who have more important things to do (I really do not see hotdog raids on LA NCIS). LA is finally attempting to legalize and better regulate small street vendors, but this has not been accomplished. An illegal (authentic) cart costs $150; a legal cart cost $12,000 and you still cannot sell Danger Dogs.[7] You are over crowded, miserable, completely helpless, you cannot get out, strangers are controlling every aspect of your life, nobody can get in, and you cannot recover the right to be a human being again until you return to your hotel.[8] That was really an accident, but I may want to try it again!",Ernest W
50,Rose Bowl Champions!,"Our MSU Spartans were the victors!!! Best part. The stadium is nice, you can see from any seat. It is a bit older, but this means plenty of legroom!!

40,BCS Game at the Rose Bowl,"We had visited the outside of the Rose Bowl in August never dreaming we would return for the BCS game. Followed advice to leave early and to use Waze to find back roads to stadium...a breeze. Parked on the golf course and tailgated...perfect weather. Again, went into stadium early to avoid the tunnel crush. Also hit the restrooms first. There was already a line but attendants helped it move along. Our seats were on row 73...just four from the top. Our seats had a good view, and it was nice to have seat backs. However, if you wanted food (expensive) or the restroom, it was a trip down, out the tunnel, and to the outer ring. All concessions and restrooms were on this level. Same thing exiting the stadium...everyone out these narrow tunnels. Then when we hit the golf course, no attendants. We heard later that they come out an hour after the event ends. Why? Also, Waze didn't help us going back because all the suggested routes were barricaded. A great day just be patient if you're going to those big events.",LakeLoafer
40,Rose Bowl game,About every seat is a great view.Went on a tour so access was great but looked like a pretty crowded mess when not on a tour bus.,Travfromohio
50,Excellent time at the Rose Bowl,We were in town for the MSU/Stanford game and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. We had a parking pass around the stadium and were able to tailgate and only a short walk in. We had ticket issues and the will call people handled our problem beautifully. Stadium food was expensive - $5 for a water but what can you do? My only suggestion is go in to the stadium early - an hour before game time is not too crazy for a special game. The reason i say this is to get to your seats there are narrow tunnels you go through which have a hard time handling the capacity so it takes a while to get in. Basically your ticket gets scanned at the main gates and all the food/beverage/restrooms are on the outer ring where you enter. Then you go through the tunnels to get to your seat. We had enough time before kick off but i wish i had known to leave more time - we missed some of the warm ups etc. A great time was had by all.,909LAH
40,Historic and Fun Day at the BCS Championship,"Because we had heard so many bad things about the Rose Bowl, maybe we were elated to find it wasn't nearly as bad as reported. We got an early start because parking was said to be very limited and expensive. We parked on the golf course and had a wonderful tailgating experience! Following the cart path led us to concessions which were reasonably priced and above average (CA Pizza Kitchen - $20 for 2 people!). The golf shop was a disappointment.We attempted pictures in front of the stadium but too crowded. Once open, we made a bathroom stop - there were attendants that kept the line moving. So even with a long line going in, it moved efficiently. The dreaded tunnels were not a problem for us - we entered 1 hr before kickoff. Tunnels were attended and they would hold you outside while the tunnel cleared. It took 20 min to get to my seat, but visited with fellow Auburn Tigers so time passed quickly.Strategically we didn't eat or drink before going to our seats, which were #11 and #13 on our row. However, our neighbors had tiny bladders and you are up and down letting people in and out. We took advantage of this by having them bring us a drink or popcorn. Leaving was a bigger chore - took a long time as both bottom and top sections use same tunnel.Food was disappointing - mostly bratwurst type hotdogs.It didn't feel like a National Championship game - just a big game. Even Auburn home games feel more prestigious. But it was a nice experience and the weather was the biggest bonus.",goldendiv
40,"Excellent, Unique Overall Experience","My 9-year old son and I attended BCS championship game in January 2014. The surrounding mountains, tailgating on the golf course and the charm of old Pasadena were all unique and wonderful. The Rose Bowl stadium itself was so-so, our seats (35-yard line) were okay but we were too far (row 71) to see well. The stadium's layout is dated and the replay screen was small (compared to modern stadiums). Everyone warned us that parking/traffic was an issue so we took the metro from our hotel in downtown LA and it worked great.",Geoff B
50,The grand daddy of them all,"We had the most amazing time at the Rose Bowl...and the Spartans won! The stadium is located in a spectacular setting, with mountains, blue skies and warm weather! We went from the Rose Bowl parade to the stadium...we thought we were going to walk...but it would have been about 5 miles; we got lucky and got a cab. You have to wear layers if you do parade and game (the weather was 47 at start of parade to nearly 80 at tailgate). The stadium is beautiful and the staff very helpful and kind. The food at the stadium is yummy and unique (mexican and traditional stadium fare). To go to the Rose Bowl is a must do! To have your team win is amazing and on the 100th anniversary of the Rose Bowl! LA was very welcoming and a great city for a bowl game! So proud of Spartan Nation! Go green!",mkini
20,Ugh those tunnels,"This stadium may be historic, but it needs to be torn down. I can't believe this place is such a dump. Those tunnels are a disaster. This stadium was not worthy to host the BCS game of 2014.",ShayC30375
40,Michigan State 2014 Rose Bowl Champs!!,"I was at Rose Bowl Stadium for The Rose Bowl. My team won so that was extra special - the game experience was 5 stars, the venue itself was very nice, 4 stars. I've seen pictures and TV images of the Rose Bowl thousands of times, but seeing it in real life is quite a treat. (It's pretty easy to get your picture in front of the stadium with the Rose Bowl sign in the background.) Ahead of time, I heard nightmare stories about the bathrooms, but our group of 2 men and 3 females had no problems using the restrooms at all (similar to any other sporting venue). I like the little fenced in courtyard around the perimeter of the stadium where they sell food and merchandise. Our group thought the stadium food was quite good and the prices were average compared to any other sporting event. I can't comment on the parking because we parked in Pasadena for the Rose Parade and walked over.",CheddaP
50,Unique Experience,"For the National BCS Championship I was able to go visit this historic stadium. It was definitely a treat. The view from the stadium is spectacular, especially of the mountains. I had heard it was best to use the bathrooms before going into the stadium. So as soon as we made it in the gate that was our first stop. One line was super long and at the next set of bathrooms there was no wait. We sat in the top of section 24 and sure it was not the best view of the field, but it wasn't a bad one.",Anna P
40,Awesome experience.,"We went to the BCS National Championship game last week and really loved our time there. We'd both heard that the bathroom situation was sub-par and that you could miss almost an entire quarter of the game just waiting in line for the restroom, so neither on of us risked that during the game. We ate outside the stadium, as stadium food tends to be expensive, but the options they had smelled great during the game. We took public transportation from downtown LA to Pasadena and then walked about 2 miles from the stop to the stadium (we didn't want to wait for the shuttle offered). We were glad we decided to walk--Pasadena is beautiful. The stadium itself is also beautiful and has mountains as the backdrop in certain seats, but I do wish it had more tunnels or exits or whatever you want to call them. Nevertheless, it is a historic venue and we are proud to have marked it off our bucket list.",lbfa2013
50,Historic Stadium,"Attended the BCS National Championship game, Auburn vs FSU. Our first visit to Pasadena and the Rose Bowl. The stadium is aged a bit but a great venue for a football game. Our seats were great, view was spectacular. We were on the press box side 30 yard line and could see every thing possible. The game was very good even though we lost. FSU fans sat next to us and were first class the entire game. This was a very enjoyable experience, all the ushers were very polite and each of them said ""Welcome to the Rose Bowl"". Wish all the new stadium seating were built like this instead of upper decks that are straight up and hard to climb steps. Concessions were hardly ever crowded, may be due to the high prices. It was a memorable experience in an historic stadium.",Bill S
20,Tired Stadium,"Rose Bowl has always been on the top of the bucket list & finally our Seminoles played there for the BCS game. This stadium is historic but wow, do they need to spend some money & upgrade the place. The food vendors were boring & over-priced. More men's bathrooms than ladies & how the fire Dept. lets them get away with those tunnels is questionable. At one point we were stuck in a tunnel & could not enter the stadium from all the people trying to get to their seats. At $385 per ticket (face value) they need to offer more than a historic name.Glad I came . . never going back.",Yvonne B

40,2014 Rose Parade and Rose Bowl,"1. Rose Parade. Definitely a wonderful spectacle - so much different in person than watching on TV. Unfortunately, beware of Sharp Seating, which controls all reservations for grandstand seating, and prescribes to ""bait and switch"" tactics. I received email confirmation of $90 seats in the section I requested; yet two weeks later received tickets for seats in a totally different location. I called the company and supposedly was forwarded to a manager, who gave me a story about how they oversold the section; however, they moved us to a section which was an upgrade, normally reserved for VIPs. As we learned when we got to Pasadena, not true! The original confirmed section was in a much better location. Additionally, when I mentioned it to some other folks at the parade, Sharp had pulled the same stunt with them. So, don't take for granted you will get seats in the section confirmed by email. Thumbs up to the Rose Parade; thumbs down to Sharp Seating.2. Rose Bowl. Excellent service and customer relations from Vivid Seats! They delivered everything promised with the tickets - from seating to parking. Their agent even worked with me to delay shipment of tickets until I would be home to receive them. Thumbs up to Vivid Seats for a great experience..",Bob G
20,Good But Old,"The Rose Bowl is historic I was excited to be there 1/6/14 for the College National Championship.The problem was that I had seats behind the goal post. It turns out you cannot see the ball game from these seats. When you have paid $1,200 (face price) for four seats you would at least expect to see the game. You had to stand on your bench to see the field except that the tall guys in front of you were standing on their seats which meant I saw nothing. I left the game after the first quarter.Not to happy with FSU and the Rose Bowl committee making a rip-off like this.",agia
40,Auburn v. FSU BCS Championship Game,"The setting is spectacular! The neighborhood and surrounding grounds are wonderful and well manicured.

Fortunately, for me, my team won the game on Jan. 1, 1988, and again on Jan. 1, 2014.Our seats, even facing the sun, were ideal. Fans in our area, some in red and some in green, were never obnoxious.Managing a huge crowd can't be easy, but Rose Bowl personnel did a fantastic job of getting people in and out of the stadium. I didn't use the stadium concessions because the Michigan State University Alumni Association provided a fantastic tailgate feast, complete with beer and wine, on the adjacent golf course.",Sanmigueleno

10,Old and poorly operated,We were at the National Championship game this week and the Rose Bowl stadium is beautiful but outdated and not functional for such a large crowd. If you went to the bathroom at any time you had to wait 20+ minutes and then after you were done you had to wait at the tunnel entrance for 40+ minutes......This stadium should not be used for such large games as it is totally not capable of handling the crowds....And I wish they didn't serve alcohol at a college game....crazy drunk people everywhere.,Jessica G
20,Rose Bowl Stadium Overrated and Antiquated,"I just returned from the BCS National Championship game in Pasadena at the Rose Bowl Stadium. The game was great! The venue, however was very disappointing. Classic by design and full of history, the stadium does not even come close to what football fans are used to today. Seats are VERY close together and uncomfortable. Concessions are not convenient to the seats, the restrooms are very old and bad by modern standards. The tunnels leading into the stadium are narrow and steps are difficult to navigate - no railings. It takes forever to leave your seat, either go to the restroom and go to concessions and return. One more thing....the venue is very scary. The tunnels are so narrow that if there were some sort of panic (earthquake or other evacuation requirement), there would be no way to exit in a reasonable time. Enjoy the history, but that's all you will enjoy!",Clovernookwilly
50,"Great Football Experience, College Football Mecca","I visited the Rose Bowl for Auburn's national championship game on January 6th, 2014. Although the game did not turn out how I would have liked (Auburn lost 34-31), the stadium was fantastic. I was seated in section 20, row 60. We had a great view of both scoreboards, the mountains in the background and the field. One difficulty we ran in to was getting around the outside of the stadium. We attempted to enter about an hour before kickoff and had to traverse several bridges plus thousands of people to get in. The other critique I heard is the tunnels can become packed if many people leave the section at one time. I did not experience this and my friends went to the bathroom before halftime and didn't encounter too much crowd, but it was a critique we heard.I had a great time visiting this hallowed ground of college football, and hope to see an Auburn victory in the future.",ahmonroe5

New Years day included transportation to parade, parade seats (which were right in the area where parade just starts, transportation to Rose Bowl game, seats, which were high but seats were really good. It also included breakfast each morning. Our tour guide was Janie and she was with us the entire 3 days and was fantastic as a tour guide. The whole package done by them was excellent. Our AAA office did not know of them but a call made to Marriott put my fears aside and we are really glad we went with them on this tour. We do a lot of traveling and would do this tour with Al Brooks again on a heartbeat and would want Janie as our tour person once again. Also forgot to mention the box lunch between the parade and game which was stated to be a deluxe box lunch and they were not wrong on stating that fact. It was really really good.",dave141351

Finding the parking lot our car was in was extremely difficult for a very short person since all sorts of large trucks were parked around the lots and it was VERY dark, but finally a very nice Limo driver gave me a map and said ""walk between the trucks"" and LO land BEHOLD, there was the right lot with the car and all the other passengers. I think my problem, aside from the trucks, was that I had previously twice entered the Rose Bowl from the front and this time the friends driving us took the back road through a nice part of Pasadena. It did make finding things in the dark difficult though. Lost to Michigan State.",mocheB20A
50,Fantastic Experience,"For the past two years, my alma mater has been a participant in the Granddaddy Of Them All, the Rose Bowl football game. I just want to compliment the organizers, who make the game a fantastic experience for the fans. How? Any number of ways...Where else will you find temperatures in the 70's on New Year's Day?The volunteers are everywhere, dressed in their bright yellow vests, to assist the fans and guests. They smile, they're helpful, and they wish everyone a Happy New Year.The vendors are friendly and accommodating.The stadium has undergone a complete renovation in the past two years and is gleaming, majestic, beautiful.About the only negative is that the parking situation leaves a lot to be desired, but since the venue is over a hundred years old, we'll give them a pass on that.",WalnutBaron
10,BCS national championship,"We are leaving the Parking lot as I type this. The Rose Bowl is a beautiful historic stadium once you make it to you very cramped seat. The views are amazing from inside. I agree with other reviewers that mentioned that an additional video board would be nice on the opposite side if the field. Acoustics were also a bit odd. Had a hard time hearing anything not over speakers. We heard that loud and clear since it was right behind our heads.Lines were insane so I was glad vendors were in the stadium even after they announced there would be none once the game began.The bathrooms were clean and the fact that they had attendants was nice. Not experienced this at many sporting events.Let me first begin by saying I DO NOT drink.Entering and exiting the stadium was a complete fiasco. Nothing positive can be said at all about how they handle this. Entering the game you had people from basically 4 different directions trying to enter 2 narrow fence openings to get to the gates. Shoulder to shoulder drunks pushing and shoving, every worker telling you different information and directions. Once inside the gate it was no better. An extremely claustrophobic sea of people. Security guads even commented on the situation. Everyone trying to enter 2 sections of seating are funneled into the same narrow space. You also have the beer vendor an bathroom lines running perpendicular through this crowd. One tunnel would close every few seconds until it cleared (sign reminded me of those used by road crews). The other gate narrowed to a single width tunnel formed by chain link fencing and plastic tarps. You had to show your ticket once again. This was also the same tunnel used for those exiting the stadium for concessions or R.R. Which was a huge problem. After that you were fine unless you needed to leave your cramped seat for anything.I was really amazed that the fire marshall would allow this to happen!!! It was a seriously dangerous situation.I really thought it could not get any worse until we left the stadium. We exited the same tunnel and the same gate we entered. However.weWe're greeted by newly erected chain link fencing. There were no directions on which way to go. We headed in the direction of our vehicle in a mass of people 10+ wide. We were heading into another crowd going the opposite direction. The only openings in the fence that we found for the first 20 min. Were for shuttles to the parsons lot. People began shoving, elbowing, cussing, etc. after a day full of drinking. My son was knocked down and fortunately my husband was able to get him up before he was injured. Husband however received several elbows, kicks, etc. security was aware of the situation because they were actually stationed every so many feet on the outside of the fence to hold it up and prevent people from climbing it. It was a terrible accident waiting to happen. Staff was apparently not able to help because everyone would tell you different directions. People were actually turned around several times by staff that told therm there was ""no exit in this direction"". Once we made it out of the fenced in danger zone we were actually amazed to see buses full of workers already leaving the grounds especially since we left immediately after the game and had just made it out.Once we made it out to the parking lot ($50 parking- not terrible) we found other changes made during the game. They had roped off all greens and bunkers which caused you to become a bit disoriented on the dark. They also had already begun to remove large balloons that were helpful landmarks. It actually took us (and MANY others) a very long time to find our car without the help of markers. It actually became humorous as everyone wondered around looking for their cars. Then it became scary. would it be to much to label rows? We were actually able to use our lot balloon marker but with land marks moved (trash cans, cars moved and rows no longer well defined, etc) it took us a good while to fund out car. Actually began to think it had been stolen. Lot filled with people still looking after we got out. Since there is no one to assist you and everything says lots must be cleared and will be locked 90 min. after conclusion of the game, they may be there until morning.I will NEVER attend anything in the Rose Bowl ever again!!! I recommend you watch an event on tv rather than in the person if at all possible!",WAREAGLE93
10,Awful,This is the most awful stadium I have ever been in. If my team ever plays in the rose bowl again I will not attend. The way they manage crowds is horrible. You could wait in line for over 2 hours just to get in to the stadium. And leaving the stadium is even more of a hassle. Overall I did not have a good experience at the rose bowl.,Harris1495
30,In need of upgrades,"On our recent trip to the Rose Bowl, we found conditions lacking. The seats were cramped and just metal benches. The score boards flickered and there was only one large Jumbo torn at the north end zone, so we had to keep turning around to see highlights etc. The concessions were poor, county fair food at best. Not a proper food concourse. Beer was expensive and many fans had too much and were unruly. In our section alone at least 10 people were taken out by security. The bathrooms were clean though and the ushers very professional. This stadium was built in 1920 and it looks. Was expecting a little more from such an iconic stadium.",Chris101264
50,Rose Bowl game,"We had a great time cheering the Michigan State Spartans to victory over Stanford in the 100th Rose Bowl game. The stadium is very clean and had many bathroom facilities available. We had end zone tickets, so we had to look at the jumbo-tron to see action on the opposite side of the field. We were in the north end zone (same side as jumbo-tron) so we had to turn around to see some of the action. If you are lucky enough to have a choice as to where you sit, it would be better to sit along the side lines.The atmosphere during the game was awesome! Lots of energy from the fans.There were a number of food and merchandise vendors on the stadium grounds before the game. Many of the merchandise vendors were sold out of MSU items before the game, but we were able to find a vendor inside the stadium before the game began.We purchased a general parking pass with our tickets and it was worth it. To get to our parking area, we just followed the directions on the parking pass. We also attended the Rose Parade, so we arrived at the parking area by 6:00am. There were no issues with traffic at this time of day. It was very convenient to have the car on the stadium grounds.Be prepared to wait in traffic when you leave the game. Also, bring snacks and something to drink to leave in the car. You will want something to eat and drink as you wait in traffic. There isn't anywhere to stop along the way so plan ahead.If your team makes the Rose Bowl, you should definitely go!",barnet38
40,Find your seat early!,"My husband and I were there for this year's Rose Bowl game. We wandered around outside the stadium a bit too long, and got caught up in the crowds trying to enter the tunnel, mixed in with the crowds trying to go in another direction to get beer/use restrooms/get food/etc. The Rose Bowl's tunnels are narrow, as this is an older stadium. Even after we got past the cross-traffic, we were in a body-to-body bottleneck of people waiting to enter the tunnel. Security had to allow only so many people in at a time, then wait for the tunnel to clear before the next batch could go. The crowd itself felt very claustrophobic.Once inside, of course, the stadium was great. Only improvement I could suggest would be a large replay screen on the south end, to supplement the one and only screen at the north end. If you're anywhere in the north endzone area, you'll have to turn around to see replays.",MaryJZemper
50,Love this place!,"We came to see Michigan State beat Stanford and we were so impressed with how well-run every aspect of the experience was. Concessions, bathrooms, attendants, etc. it it old but SO BEAUTIFUL. Sections 16-22 are good for being in the shade with view if jumbotron.",MACC2
50,"If your team is there, you should come","It was on the bucket list, so when MSU made it, we booked our flight.Next time, we will tivo the Rose Parade and have more time at the tailgate. It was euphoric being in the stadium I had seen on TV for many years. It is very walkable from the parade, if you also include the Metro. If you do, PRE PAY FOR YOUR METRO TICKET. Everyone on the planet will be walking with you, so jump ahead of the massive line to buy the Metro ticket, with a pre paid ticket!!!! There is a beer/wine store just across from the Metro, if you need to imbibe at the tailgate. We walked from Pasadena City College.I had heard the lines in the stadium were horrible. We did not find any lines, people were riveted to their seats. Hot dogs started at $6 and double beers at $13. Basically what we find at all stadiums.There is a shuttle at one point to take you from the Metro, the line for that was waaaaay too long, so we walked. It was a very nice 30 minute walk. People said later the shuttle line was long but moved quickly.Lots of shopping along the route. After the game, all went on sale, so waiting is not a bad plan, since you don't want to hold all those souvenirs during the game.",Sheilavehla
50,100th Rose Bowl game,"100 year of experience has educated this venue well, if you have ever attended a sporting event or concert at a large venue you undoubtedly know what I am talking about. Bathrooms were clean the whole day, even the portable one's were and had towels and soap available, lines were organized and staff professional. they even continued to check tickets at gates late into 4th quarter assuring you didn't have scammers crowding the lower bowl food and drink prices are what you would expect at a venue like this but lines went quick even at half time! can't comment on getting in and out of stadium area as we walked in and grabbed a uber cab on the way out( uber was everywhere and very easy to get)",Zimco01
40,"Classic Stadium, memorable football add to your bucket list",The stadium is much improved in that seats with backs have replaced the bleachers of the 70's when we first attended Rose Bowl Games on New Years Day. The atmosphere makes up for the lack of big screens and the ideal Southern California climate makes for a marvelous New Year. The opportunity to view the floats the day before the parade around the grounds is an excellent chance to see the artistry of the floats and to interact with the designers. Great party environment on game day.,KLE2013
30,Very happy MSU won but...,"I have NEVER seen a more unorganized stadium as this one.*Massive crush of people all trying to get to their gate (and tripping over the portable line stanchions sticking out in travel lanes)*very disappointing food choices (not one vegetarian/vegan offering)*stupid policy of no bottle tops/unopened beer cans allowed (resulting in spills all over my clothing and flat drinks after a few minutes)*2.5 hour wait for shuttles back to Parsons lot after the game - lines forming left and right and meandering all over the place and yet not going anywhereVery glad State won, but the rest of the experience was a disaster.",9g1a6j
10,"Great setting, horse & buggy access","The Rose Bowl is a classic and should be experienced at least once. Pasadena is horrible for large crowds. Aside from the freeways, access through the town and to the stadium hasn't changed much since the automobile was invented. Plan on spending more time waiting in the car or on the bus than attending the parade or game. Until Pasadena figures out mass transit getting to the Rose Bowl is a joke.",Vao_Fefe

Was in town for another event in Pasadena and did not want to miss the opportunity. Bought a general admission ticket and saw the 2nd & 3rd qtrs. I knew the place was enormous but never thought I was as far away from the field as I had figured to be. Yes, u are not close but you're not a mile away, either. It's a fantastic setting that reminds you a lot of The Cotton Bowl/Texas State Fairgrounds. You walk in then there is this huge festival vending area that goes all around the stadium. And there is always a giant crowd out there that doesn't care about he game!! VENDORS EVERYWHERE!!! Only drawback is that it's not an on-campus stadium. But it is definitely a unique experience unto itself. I highly recommend it!",k-towntravbache
30,Game day,"Rose Bowl is a wonderful California tradition but the stadium only has 1 large screen at one end of stadium. We were the visiting team and our seats were Ok, but had to turn around behind us every time we wanted to see the play at the opposite end of field. The city did a great job of Shuttle Bus but after game had to walk nearly a mile to get back to end of line to turn around and go back to get on bus. Took Total walking time to get to end of line and back to bus was about 45 minutes. But with that many people is was not bad.",jgunning3

40,UCLA FOOTBALL EXPERIENCE,"Attended 11.15.13 game versus Washington.The Stadium is a jewel and is in progress of upgrading all amenities. The 1 thing I didn't like about it is that the seating, as you move away from field, moves more away from the field and less upwards than in more modern stadiums. As a result you could be further away from the field on the 50 yard line than you'd be in the end zones.I parked my car in downtown Pasedena at Parson's center ($15) and took free shuttle to the Bowl (10 minute ride). NOT RECOMMENDED! Bus driver got lost on way to the Bowl. After the game the line for the shuttle was hundreds, yes hundreds, of yards long with thousands of people in it. Yes, there are many buses and the line moves quickly, but it can take 1-2 hours to get on a bus after the game. Do yourself a favor and park at the Bowl ($25). The traffic flows pretty well out of lots and you're in your car, not standing in a line to get on a bus. Don't understand why anyone would take the bus!If you are a college football fan in general and not specifically a UCLA fan, I'd recommend a USC game at the Coliseum versus UCLA at the Rose Bowl. Why? I did both on consecutive nights recently. USC game at Coliseum was spectacular. The UCLA game was just very good. The Coliseum has wider seats and aisles, seats are closer to field, USC fans more enthusiastic, and the atmosphere is electric. Not same at UCLA game. And the USC band is just so much better.Still, UCLA football at the Rose Bowl is a great experience.",Peter H
40,Sensory overload but in a good way!,"There is so much to see at the Rose Bowl Flea Market that you're feet will be done before your eyes are. With this event only once a month, thousands come out to enjoy all there is to offer. I think if you are a treasure hunter at heart, you will enjoy the many unique vintage items that you'll never find on your local retail store. If you don't care for shopping, this is definitely not the place for you. It's hot as there is little shade so put on plenty of sunscreen, bring a hat, and good walking shoes. A few bottles of water is also a good idea.It's actually quite hard to see everything in one visit. There's just that much stuff and you can easily get lost. So once you can get past the $8 price of admission, you'll take a step back into history and know why thousands come. I recommend it at least once in a lifetime.",Caroline L

Admission price is based on the time you enter. 7am to 8am @ $15 pp; 8am to 9am @ $10 pp; after 9am @ $8 pp. I believe it's $20 pp, if you wish to enter while the vendors are unloading ( around 5 or 6 am). Parking is ""free."" I highly recommend bringing a cart or wagon to carry your new found treasures. We walked up and down aisles for over 6 hours. Sun lotion & water are a must.

The central section is enormous. You'll find all sorts of bric a brac and furniture. Want ""Pyrex"", there is plenty. Today I found some amazing vintage greeting cards. Bring a water bottle with you. Water purchased inside the market is outrageous at $3 and $5. On a hot day consider bringing an umbrella for protection. Parking is free. However there is an admission fee.

The antique section is the most popular and you will find treasures from 70 retro sheik furniture to rustic antique finds. Bring along a pad for taking notes to return to favorite booth or item, as the place is so big that you may never find your way back to re-visit a potential purchase.

It's outdoor, open all year, heated and warm enough to swim even in January and December. The US Olympic team and water polo team have warmed up here before their trips to the Olympics.

It's a perfect 5k trip around and slightly uphill on one side.If you get bored easily, however, there are lots of great running routes that start and end at the Rose Bowl.Pasadena is also a great place to cycle. Many great routes begin and end at the Rose Bowl.There are lots of beautiful residential streets with mature landscaping and wonderful architecture.There are also great trails up to JPL and up into the mountains if pavement is not really your style.Check out any of the running sites or cycling sites for suggested routes.

I remember I didn't want to look out of shape so I would practice running at the gym first so I could actually run with him without stopping!*Running with my sister while she trained for her marathon.*Having an allergy attack in Spring time while running around the Rose Bowl*Coming to the flea market when admission was under $7.00*Walking my Chow Chows to the Rose Bowl and having them collapse in the grass (Both of them have passed away already)*Walking to the top of the hill to watch fireworksWe still visit it during their Americafest Fourth of July celebrations. Overall it's a great place full of history and they have many events here. One of the many treasures in the City of Pasadena.",Charlene C

20,Rose Bowl Flea Market- Vendor point of view.,"I just returned from my one & only stint as a vendor at the Rose Bowl Flea Market. Coming from Northeastern Nevada, I had high hopes of selling allot of collectibles / antiques.Needless to say, whether it was the weather which was overcast & poor or if it's still the economy, this was a money losing proposition. I brought a multitude of items to sell & my prices were very reasonable. Overall my sales were extremely poor. I purchased a spot in the White section, which was my first & most serious mistake. If at all possible, purchase a spot in the antiques / collectibles section. Buyers see rows & rows of sellers & if your merchandise is not in the correct selling section, your sales will suffer. The seller across from us only sold 20% of what he told us he sold in the antiques / collectibles area.Unless you are selling clothing, I would not recommend the white section. Watch for low-life scumbags who will steal items from you if given the opportunity. I lost a couple of $40 items because I got distracted with potential buyers. Just about all of the buyers expected discounts off prices that were already slashed. A high percentage of buyers are mainly low-ballers who expect a 50% discount on every item you have. I had very few sales for $ 10.00 or less items that were already discounted 20% off comparable ebay items.The hipsters are out in force. They will take pictures of your sales items but are not interested in buying anything. I did meet a couple of buyers who were nice & bought a few things off of us. The gay couple who bought a number of Longaberger baskets we sincerely appreciated your business. If you had not bought these items, our trip would have been a complete disaster!The adjoining sellers on the other hand were kind, generous people who gave me some good advise. We appreciated their kindness & willingness to just say Hi.All in all stay away unless you purchase a spot in the right area, & I would wait until April. We did not see any security around. Be prepared.",Jim W
40,Good Times...,"Fun walking spot, leading to the Arroyo. The Flea Market is great. There's a swingset, and playground where high-school shenanigans with me and my ""group"" took place. Make of it what you want: people need to use their imaginations more, anyway!!! ^_^",marybelle08

50,Great Place To Hold A Half Marathon,I just finished the half marathon and the location was perfect. There is a very nice running/walking area surrounding it. I was surprised how wide the area was that had been set aside for daily use as a running/walking area. It was fun to say that I crossed the 50 yard line in the Rose Bowl (that was where the finish line was located).,grove911

This is a great place to watch a football game. We were looking at the press box and the mountain range behind it. The sun was shinning on us all day. This is a must do if you can.

50,Once in a lifetime experience!,"My husband and I booked our vacation to Cali before we knew Wisconsin had a chance of making it to the Rose Bowl. Once they had, we decided we wanted to see the game and take our chances with scalpers. We parked on the golf course behind the stadium to tailgate. The cost was $40/car and split the cost with friends so it wasn't bad. We had a great time tailgating with other great fans. Be prepared to be bombarded with people trying to sell you stuff. At the stadium, the gates were marked well and didn't take long to find our seats, which were in the student section. We were standing the entire time with the exception of half time but there was enough room to move around. The atmosphere is undescribeable and we were so excited to be there. We got a great deal on our tickets just 15 minutes before the game started. Depending on who's playing this isn't always recommended but since this was Wisconsin's third appearence in a row, it was easy to get tickets and negotiate prices. They served beer there but the cost was $10 for a can, obviously to deter people from over-doing it. I got a hot dog, which tasted good and cost me $5. I highly recommend going once if your team is playing. We didn't see the parade or take any tours but had a great time that we will never forget!",Kim D
50,Go if you can.,"Took a tour, much less stress. Seats were very best, although very small. Take a seatpad,no room at your feet for anything .Porta-potties w/ long lines The parade moves by quickly.

50,Great experience,Went to our first ever bowl game and had a fantastic time. Very easy parking in lot D great per game activities. We went in to the stadium early and had no issues woth lines and were able to go right to our seats.

20,NO CAMERAS,"We went on a bus right from the Rose Parade, where we'd taken many photos with my new Canon camera and 2 lenses, to the Rose Bowl. They refused to let me in without leaving my camera and both lenses with them! I talked with numerous Security people and a Pasadena PD officer - it is Rose Bowl policy that any camera that can use different lenses is 'professional' and cannot be allowed inside! My seat was 6 rows from the top of the stadium, row 71, in the end-zone! I guess they were worried that I'd try to sell a photo taken with my 135mm lens! When asked, they confirmed that only cell phone and point-and-shoot cameras are allowed. So be forewarned -- THERE IS NO PLACE THAT THEY TELL YOU THIS IN ADVANCE! Imagine how many people go from the parade to the Bowl and learn this - although the application of the 'rule' is arbitrary - the woman in front of me had a Nikon with 3 lenses!! I don't think I'll ever go back to the Rose Bowl.",Hoonihoo
40,Rose Bowl Game Atmosphere is Awesome!,"We attended the 2013 Rose Bowl game between Wisconsin and Stanford. We lost again, but had a great time.• Great atmosphere and spectacle• Ride the light rail to the Memorial Park station• Free shuttle rides to the game -- its about a 2 mile walk from the station• Plan to get to the game early -- a lot of people, plus lots of pre-game festivities going on outside the stadium• Getting in the stadium area is pretty easy. Getting to the seats is more challenging. Long tunnels with lines, and locating your seats• Unbelievable experience",Riley73

Numerous food vendors are also on site. The normal hours are 9am-3pm but early admission starts at 7 with a small additional entry fee. Parking is ample and free. One additional treat-attendees are welcome to go inside the famous stadium for a peek and photo opportunity!

The flea market is once a month, so there are only 1 or 2 months when you should not go. Other than that - enjoy! Bring cash.

50,The parade is superb and the stadium is neat==but getting around is difficult,"It is difficult to get info on logistics to see the Rose Bowl Parade and the Rose Bowl game so want to share our experience. First, there are masses of people and public transportation is very limited (we walked nearly all the way to the stadium from the l500 block of Colorado Blvd but did catch a train for part of the way after following hundreds of other people walking who also didn't know where they were going--but it was a happy crowd.) The motel staff didn't know about buses/shuttles, security staff didn't know--and an earlier phone call to the Rose Bowl yielded info that parking was available but we didn't see any other than a $35 park and ride (with a mile or more shuttle after you park and people were lined up for blocks for the shuttle.) There could be better info on transportation but it can be done without paying for the package deals if you don't mind some walking.We stayed at a no-frills motel on Colo Blvd (Westways Inn) about half way in the parade route and got parade tickets ahead of time from sharp seating which were located a half block from the motel (great seats.) The hotel which is going to become a Howard Johnson's this month was $200 a night--if you call 6 mos ahead you might get a street side room which runs $800 for 3 nights. Downtown Pasadena would be a better location to get to the stadium but don't think there are hotels right on the parade route and they are likely more expensive. Grandstand parade tickets are $75 each which includes visiting the floats the next day--strongly recommended!The Parade: It is terrific and visiting the floats afterward is a must! One of the interesting things was to see the people camped out the day before--totally covering the sidewalks of Colorado Blvd. People had mattresses, sleeping bags, heaters, fires, food, games and a fun attitude--many do this every year--and it was cold! One man who had 2 large heaters restaurant-style, said he could stay in a hotel but would miss out on the party. A large group of young people from a church were preparing gallons of hot chocolate to be given out at midnight. It was a festive atmosphere and included children of all ages. No one seemed concerned about the dropping temperatures. Interestingly, the after-mess--and it was huge after the parade--was totally cleaned up by the following day.The Rose Bowl: the stadium is neat and easy to navigate once there. It is older and seems small but holds l00,000 people. Lots of bathrooms and helpful people. (It would have been better if Wisconsin had won, however.) You need to leave for the stadium soon after the parade since it takes awhile to get there.A real highlight is visiting the floats the next day (You can do this for $l0 if you don't get parade grandstand tickets.) The floats are unbelievable. Thousands attend this too so be prepared to park and walk blocks. There are some shuttles but, again, getting info is not easy.Old Pasadena is a nice surprise--downtown has many restaurants/bars and high-end stores all in a 2-3 block area. There is a real party atmosphere after the game, of course. All in all, it is worth the trip and can be done without a package deal--tho that would likely make it easier. One thing--be prepared for cool weather tho game day was beautiful in the afternoon. (But the next day it rained all day so we were lucky.)",kansascity000
20,Dumpiest stadium I've ever been in,"We went to the 2011 Rose Bowl, and while the game itself was awesome, and the event was a once-in-a-lifetime experience I would not miss, the Rose Bowl stadium itself is the dumpiest stadium I have ever been in. Bring your walking shoes because parking is horrendous, and expensive (really, $40 to park?!? That's more than we paid for the Fiesta Bowl last year!), and you still hike forever and a day to get there. The flow of people around and into the stadium is nonexistant, bathroom facilities are subpar, and the seats are old and uncomfortable. There are hardly any food/beverage vendors selling items in the stands, and due to the limited concession stands, you'll miss huge chunks of the game if you go down to get a drink or something to eat. There is only one video board, so if you're sitting right under it, have fun twisting your neck around to see any replays. All in all, one of the worst football stadiums I've been to - the Rose Bowl needs a new home, or to seriously upgrade their facilities.",TCU_2003
50,If you like Flea Markets- don't miss this one!,I went to the Rose Bowl for the Flea Market a couple of Sundays ago and had a great time. It was $8 to get in. I have gone many times and I always have so much fun! It is not every Sunday-but I believe it is the second Sunday of every month. You will see the most amazing things- this is a real flea market! The majority of sellers are selling used items- but some are selling new things. It takes hours to get through and is exhausting but you won’t want to tear yourself away (just one more row…). We usually only get through about a third of all the sellers because it is so gigantic. My advice- if you see something you like buy it-or write down the location of the vendor if you want to go back. You will never find them again otherwise. Be prepared for sun even if it’s cloudy in the morning. My favorite finds from my last visit: an antique rolling pin ($7) and a French Cuisine cookbook from the 60’s ($3).,RTTravels
