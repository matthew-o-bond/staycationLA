50,"Ride the Train, See the Barn","There are two main points of interest here, riding the miniature trains and the Disney Barn. I think the barn is only open the third Sunday, you should verify to make sure. The trains run every Sunday. There is a modest fee for the train ride and I was surprised how much track they have and it took more than a few minutes. The Barn is free, but there can be a line. As my luck usually runs, we waited about a half hour and there was no line as we exited. If you have a light heart, it’s run.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KennethL828
40,Great Family Outing,Interesting especially knowing that Walt Disney a founding member. Educational for everyone. Disney's barn where he worked with trains is open the 3rd Sunday of each month.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChuckR9999
50,So much fun!,"This is really cool place. The train rides last about 15 minutes and it only cost $3. Just to warm you must be at least 34 inches to ride the train. The train takes to gold mines, tunnels and little city which reminds me of Disneyland. My son and I had a blast. And they even have a cool set up where kids can watch a participant. They have a really small shop but if your kids love train rides this is the place to take them. Don't forget you must be at least 34 inches to ride the train.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/selvync2014
30,Great miniature railway but could be better,Just around the corner from Travel Town and with free parking Live Steamers is open for just a few hours each Sunday. Despite it’s name most of the miniature locomotives were diesels. At just $3 each the ride was great fun with the guard pointing out a group of deer as we passed them. However there aren’t many places to take photos and despite having a number of items of rolling stock on view these are all off limits to the visitor and are for members only. One volunteer told us that they had to open to the public once a week as part of their lease agreement. What a shame they dont make more of an effort and expand the attraction and let visitors see more of what’s on offer rather than restrict everyone to a short train ride.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/149stuartc
50,For the train fanatic,"This is a small ride on train ride that covers at least 1.5 km of a space that has citrus fruit trees, trestle bridge and tunnels. This is obviously a work of love for these people who just want to share their joy in having these electric, steam, diesel and propane engine trains runningWe have been on a lot of train rides as my son is a fanatic, first collecting them and now taking pictures of them. This is by far the best one we have ever ridden and it was only $3. Parking is free.Only drawback is that it is only open on some Sundays from 11am to 3pm. Check the website before going.Bonus is that Walt Disney’s barn and his train set-up is next door and free (by donation). Lots of memorabilia and things to read. This one is more for adults as there was really only a train table for the children to touch.Travel Town, a park with restored steam and diesel trains, is right next door on the other side. By donation, could be free, only one that needs paying is the train ride. Much shorter than the LA live steamers, but open everyday. Nice gift shop, picnic tables can be reserved for parties and used for packed lunches.Not many places are almost free esp. in LA. Worth to visit these.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jdglek
30,Fun But Not Really Free,"I took my 2 little ones on the train ride. At the ticket counter, the salesman asked for a minimum ""donation"" of $3 per person. There were 3 of us so I gave $15 to help them out even more. The train ride was very fun and relaxing. We left and thought we could walk to the travel town train museum (super confusing that the Los Angeles live streamer is unrelated to the museum since they are right next to each other and google maps led me here instead of the museum) but the walk was too far for my kids and they asked to ride the train again. I obliged especially since the line was short. I got to the ticket counter and the guy didn't recognize me and said again, $3 minimum donation per person. I told him I already paid $15 and he awkwardly said to me ""well how much more are you going to pay?"" and wouldn't give me tickets until I paid another $9. So no it is not free. False advertising. And they also wouldn't let me use their bathroom at the end. Said it was for members only. So $24 for 1 adult and 2 kids for the day doesn't get you bathroom privileges apparently. If you are going to guilt people out of their money you might as well just charge everyone at least $3 and quite acting and advertising like it's a free experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hakej
50,Great little train ride,Fun for the whole family. For $3 you take a trip around the area -- twice. Get there before 3:00 as it closes then. Located in Griffith Park. One of several things to do there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/545kareno
50,Excellent value for money,"We saw this on trip advisor before our trip from the uk and decided it would be a good trip out for our first day in la. We spent the first part of the morning at travel town and then drove down for a ride on the steamers. The ride cost $3 each and the staff (volunteers) are really friendly. Several of them realised we were English and took an interest as to how we found out about them and why we had visited, told my train mad son all about the engine and thanked us all for our visit. Lovely little five/ten minute journey. We saw Disneys barn...as a big Disney fan I was disappointed we couldn't tie our visit in with a day this was open but you get to see it from the train and it was lovely to see.A must for any train fan big or small...you don't need a child with you to ride this...no excuse needed!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelbug_family39
50,Walt's Barn,"I can't speak specifically to the LA Live Steamers other than to say the ticket booth people were lovely and helpful in directing us next door to Walt's Barn. I did see many happy families riding the trains around, and we want to go back when we have more time, but our destination on this particular day was Walt's Barn. The Carolwood Foundation maintains the barn that Walt Disney used as a workshop in the back yard of their Carolwood Drive estate when they lived there. The barn is preserved along with the workbenches that Walt built himself, and a bunch of memorabilia from his family and the trains he loved so much. This is a must-do for any hard-core Disney fan, and admission is free. I believe the LA Live Steamers static exhibits can be seen free of charge but there is a cost for riding the trains (which would be TOTALLY WORTH IT!) Wonderful people in both places. It was 106 degrees the day we were there, though, and no air conditioning, so I'd recommend a cooler day for your visit. The Barn is only open on the third Sunday of the month year-round and they have extra dates on the first Sundays of the month during the summer. All run by volunteers!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/617tracyl
50,Adventures by Disney,"Magical place with awesome volunteers! As a Disney fanatic, it was a very special experience to visit Walt's barn, one of the original train cars from Disneyland, and meet the inspiration for Tink!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tikiroom89
50,Fun for Everyone!,"The Los Angeles Live Steamers is a place that we always visit with my father-in-law, when he comes to see us from the UK. It's just us adults and we never feel out of place. The Los Angeles Live Steamers is for everyone, not only kids. Big kids are welcome too! :-)At just three dollars a ride, this is a huge bargain. The ride is long, about 10-15 minutes and goes on a long track over bridges and through tunnels. The steamers are only open 11-3pm on Sundays, weather permitting, so it gets busy.Also, once a month, they open up Walt Disney's Carolwood Barn, which is on a separate section of their property. You can see it from the train ride, but you can go in it when it is open. This is a must-do for Disney fans.We love the Los Angeles Live Steamers!Like my review? Check out my blog!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KarenH644
40,Great train ride,"We went on a day that the Walt Disney Barn was open, too. The combination of the history of Disney's love of trains with the friendly talkative volunteers who shared it and then the train ride by the Steamers was terrific. The ride was more comfortable and more exciting (a little faster) than expected. Loved the whole experience (both kids and adults).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LesMcQ
50,Ride the small trains - great for kids and adults,"Past the Zoo and just before Travel Town (which you should visit too) is a hidden treasure for kids.Ride different type of small trains (Electric, Diesel, Steam) Engine Trains and ride for approx. 10-15 minutes on bridges and tunnels. Very fun. Donation fee of $3.00 / person.Open on Sundays only from 11am to 3pm. Please call to verify, bad weather can cause the place to be closed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Adih361
