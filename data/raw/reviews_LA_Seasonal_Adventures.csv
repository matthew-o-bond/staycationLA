40,Fun for the kiddos!,"Although this is advertised as a pumpkin patch, pumpkins were sparse on the day we were there. However, there were a lot of activities for the kids to do. There was a small petting zoo with rabbits, ducks, chickens, pigs, turkeys, and goats. There was also a face painting booth that attracted quite a few kids. Lots of various rides, slides, and games. All in all, a good place for kids to have a lot of fun.",RktDogg
