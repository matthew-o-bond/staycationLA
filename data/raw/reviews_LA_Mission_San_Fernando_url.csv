50,A nice visit,Well worth a visit. A nice way to see history in the Los Angeles area. The grounds were well kept and peaceful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nass673
50,An interesting glimpse of Spanish California,I visited Mission San Gabriel a few weeks ago and really enjoyed the visit. This mission is sufficiently distinct from the San Gabriel one that you would gain another perspective of early California if you check out this landmark as well. Another CA mission gem!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MimiY_13
40,History Preserved,The inside of the church is dark due to the beautifully carved wood. Please take the time to see the other buildings. They have preserved the historical artifacts very well. Do not miss the very large still! Another surprise was it is the burial place of Bob Hope.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elizabethlU1196RK
50,Beautiful mission,"It was a very hot day visiting this mission. (Nearly 100 degrees) Tje church is beautiful, but there were people loudly talking in the back balcony area after the service. It was a distraction for us as we wished to sit in silence. The map was a bit difficult to follow so we missed some things. Bob Hope's resting place is in a beautiful garden. There is a large gift shop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Linenminnesota
40,a real gem,"We were in the area visiting the Nethercutt Musuem and stopped by here near the end of the day on a Thursday. Entrance was $5 a person and we basically had the place to ourselves. The church is pretty basic and has a beautiful alter. An added bonus is that Bob Hope is buried in a garden just outside the church. The mission buildings have museums in them. The convent building has an extensive museum as well, much larger than the rooms in the mission buildings. There are some beautiful things here, especially in the convent section. I wasn't clear how much, if anything, was original. One of the rooms shows the ruins of the church, I think all of the missions went through that phase after they were shut down. I think we spent about an hour here and it was a very nice, very quiet visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/So_Cal_Illini_81
50,Mission,Amazing visit and tour of this historic mission in Los Angeles. We had a great tour guide who was able to answer many questions. It is the 13th mission that I have visited and I love hearing the history behind each unique mission.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Joyfullyanointed
40,Important Historical Site,"A beautiful place to visit, but employees never know the answer to any questions about mission history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Seahawk200
50,The Madonna Room!!,"San Fernando mission was the 13th mission I've seen and one of the bigger missions. Lots to see and walk around which I appreciate. The most random, unexpected, and cool things was seeing the Bob Hope memorial garden. The must see in this mission is definitely the Bob Hope garden and the Madonna room which is filled with many versions & styles of the Blessed Mother. Very cool!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SweetPetiteTravels
50,Quaint Old Mission,There is a real sense of history when you visit here. The old church is simple and has a lovely peaceful atmosphere.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Commited_Traveller
40,An unusual California Mission,"Hadn't been here for decades, and had forgotten how scenic the place was! It is a much larger establishment than most of the other California Missions, and offers a wonderful array of exhibits on the California Mission culture. The grounds are lovely, and the exhibits tell the story of the California Missions very well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DonaldYokum
50,The fourth Mission in the Camino Real of California trail,"This mission, as the other Missions in California, are part of paradise inside the middle of the activity in the city",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Miguelvaldez
40,Bob Hope rests here for eternity,One of the 21 missions scattered around Alta California- the most amazing fact here is that Bob Hope and his wife are both buried here versus the star laden Forest LawnDo take the time to visit the church and museum$5 charge per person to visit - well worth,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jfadds
50,Beautiful Mission and Bob Hope Memorial Gardens,"On a motorcycle trip the 5th of 21 California Missions I visited was Mission San Fernando Rey de España. This is where my Brother Paul (RIP) and I went to the Seminary in 1962 and 1964 respectively. It was known as Our Lady Queen of the Angels Seminary. The Seminary has since been moved to Camarillo, CA and the buildings I was in is now Bishop Alemany High School. The original Bishop Alemany High School was on the hill behind the Seminary but it was destroyed on January 17th (my birthday) in 1994 during the Northridge earthquake magnitude 6.7 causing 57 deaths with more than 8,700 injured. The mission was founded on September 8, 1797. Chronologically it is the 17th Mission of the 21. Bob and Delores Hope are buried here in the Bob Hope Memorial Garden. There was a beautiful Mexican Wedding and Spanish Mass when I was there so I sat in the back and enjoyed the festivities. So be forewarned there may be a service going on and you’ll be able to enter the grounds but not the Cemetery or church until the service is over. There is ample parking and behind the church there is the famous San Fernando Mission Cemetery where many famous people are buried. You’ll not be able to access it from the Mission but will have to drive down to Sepulveda and turn right and you’ll see it on your right. Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TimDore
50,Beautiful Mission,"From the outside this mission did not look like it was very large. But it is, there is alot to see. The court yard is huge with plenty of space to sit. The Bob Hope memorial is very serene and well kept as is the mission grounds. Would recommend a visit to this mission if you are in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/laurasS1909RK
50,Haven of peace only a few miles from Downtown LA,"Beautifully restored California Mission with serene landscaping. Does not feel boxed in by modern development.Quite a bit larger area compared to some of the other missions and also more artifacts are available on display to get an idea of life on these missions.As with most attractions, if you go early at opening hour (0900am) especially on a weekday, you will have the place practically to yourself.Well appointed gift shop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ADXBS
40,Check another CA mission off my list,"I love the history behind all the Spanish missions in California and Texas so I wanted to see one that I hadn't visited yet. It did not disappoint. My teenager learned a lot, and Bob Hope popped up everywhere on our CA trip including here. We should have got up a little earlier to attend the Sunday service. It's beautifully rebuilt after falling into ruins and once again after the earthquake damage.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D904ITpamelab
50,Beautiful and Underrated Gem Among The Missions,This is the fourth mission I've visited and it is quite gorgeous! Very clean and well maintained property. What's cool about this place is that it is the namesake for the entire San Fernando valley in which it resides. There is a lot of beautiful art work from many centuries ago and lots of cool rooms like the wine cellar downstairs and the bishop's room where he would sleep. It's not as famous as Mission San Juan Capistrano to the south but it is still just as lovely of a place to visit. I will say that it can be a little tricky to find parking for the first time but you can park on the street depending on the time of day. Highly underrated landmark filled with history.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/colbys2014
50,Lovely and peaceful place,Came here to pay my respects to Ritchie Valens as I was obsessed with the La Bamba film as a child! The entrance actually features in the film and the resting place is very peaceful and tranquil. Well worth a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChrisGower1975
30,Fun trip filled with history,"Even though the excursion to the San Fernando mission was entertaining and educational, as well as visually appealing there was still",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FLtrotter
50,Peaceful destination,"Landscaping is done well. Please tour the Convent 1st floor (and wine cellar). See main Church (beautiful) and keep walking toward back of property to see Bob Hope memorial garden. Allow 1 hour overall, or more. Amazing history to this mission stop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joeisle17
50,Reflective and Informative,"A wonderful place to visit, to learn about the life of the Missions and those who lived and worked in them. A wonderfully presented series of buildings and displays. So many unique objects on display.The grounds and gardens are very well maintained, and there is the Bob Hope Memorial for fans of his.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PlesFam
40,Beautiful Grounds & Lots to See,"This is a beautiful mission with beautiful grounds and a large museum with lots to see. Bob Hope’s grave is on the property and Mission San Fernando Cemetery is next door, if you were a Rickey Valens fan like me and wanted to visit her grave. Nice lady in the gift shop was very helpful. The church is large and beautiful. For photography it is pretty nice. Small entrance fee when they open at 9:00AM.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Woodpecker48

40,Well maintained for a California mission.,"I have been to 3 California missions and this one is the first to appeal to me for the nice grounds. It also has better historical information than the others I have visited. It also has a wonderful collection of art. Unfortunately, I could not visit the chapel because of a wedding, but I was very favorably impressed by the rest of the facility. It is in fabulous shape for something over two hundred years old.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ransom007
50,"Fantastic, Eerie Museum Collection of Relics","San Fernando has the largest and creepiest collection of relics, statues, weapons, paintings, flags, clothing and tools that fill several rooms. These rooms encircle the mission's charming garden, which contains a wonderful old fountain, and is of course adjacent to the LA Diocese headquarters and the San Fernando Mission Cemetery. Visit the Bob Hope Memorial Garden while you’re there, or the graves of Ritchie Valens, William Bendix and Walter Brennan in the adjacent cemetery (grounds workers can direct you if you don't have a map). And don’t miss the gift shop, which carries beautiful and affordable religious / historic souvenirs. But the museum is the main attraction here – and if it isn’t haunted, nothing is. The ancient Indian village of Achois was located on the Mission grounds (it used to appear in Google Maps -- why it's gone, I have no idea) and some have seen an Indian ghost here. Which isn’t surprising, when you read about the mission’s history in the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SoCalRambler
40,Great historical site,This was a very well maintained Mission and lots to see. Open area museum with lots of historical items. Easy to find. Cute little gift shop with lots to choose from.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nlowinger
40,Beautiful grounds and strong influence in Spanish fort architecture,"Founded 1797, the 17th old Spanish Mission, it includes a seminary, museum, relics, beautiful grounds and flowers. You will also find the grave of Bob Hope and his wife. Easy parking at the front lot. Remarkable for the Spanish influence which includes large walls and vertical windows.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SDwalkerSOCAL
50,Beautiful Mission and Bob Hope's burial site,"Wonderful part of California history, with displays and a museum to bring it all to life. A peaceful place to sitBob Hope and his wife are buried in a nicely landscaped private garden at the back of the mission grounds, which is open to the mission visitors at no extra charge. After you take a look at the church interior, go out the other door and the garden is right there in front of your. Don't overlook the big bras relief of Bob on the garden wall!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/firstcpm
50,"Very extensive, very interesting mission! See the archives!","We visited on a Thursday. It takes a couple of hours to go through the place.It's well worth the $5 charged for adults!Follow the guide sheet they give you.Who knew that Bob Hope is buried there, too?The Archdiocese deserves lots of credit for the restoration and maintenance they are doing there!There is a flyer in the shop that explains the reredos (altar screen) that is installed. That costs 25 cents (including tax). Buy one when you pay for your admission and take it with you. It explains how a very old Spanish artwork is now installed in this historic mission!Check for the Archive hours. Ask when you come in. There are some public hours - we happened to get there at the right time - and its very interesting to see the exhibits and books there! The volunteers working there were very helpful.Allow a couple of hours for your visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MikeVdP
40,Beautiful place for a wedding.,"My nephew got married there at the Mission Church, Very nice setting on a beautiful day. Very interesting history about this fort/mission. One must visit the Bob Hope Memorial Gardens there where Bob and his wife are buried.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/288kentc

50,Mission Tour vacation,I am on a Mission tour for my vacation. This is my 4th one to visit. I really liked this one. The museum part has so many things to look at. I liked the library and the wine cellar are not in others that I visited.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tcard2013
50,Beautiful Mission,This is right near my house and many family members laid to rest nearby. There is a sense of tranquility at this Mission and holds a lot of history. Certainly recommend anyone to visit at least once if in the area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jonn479
30,A Reconstructed Mission,"While I read that it a restored mission, the buildings are not restored originals but reconstructed instead. The grounds, however, are lovely. While the museum tells the story of the mission and related stories, several of the artifacts on display are only remotely related. Still, if your goal is to visit all the Spanish missions in California, then the Mission San Fernando Rey de Espana is a must stop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cabchidester
40,Peaceful Afternoon,"There are signs pointing you toward this historic building all along the street. The entrance is the one with the sign titled, San Fernando Mission, not the driveway titled Archdiocese. It cost 5 dollars for entry through a gift shop. The builds are beautiful, and the displays are very high quality. The property is large enough so its unlikely you'll walk along anyone during your tour. The awesome crescendo of the tour is the church itself, sitting in front of the cemetery.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/282jayj
50,San Fernando Mission,"If you are into California history and or the California missions up and down the state, this one one of them worth the visit. I've visited this mission twice now and find that it offers a little more then a few of the other missions. The outside of the mission has been restored, yet they did leave a couple of spots where you can actually see the original adobe walls when the mission was first built. This particular mission offers several more rooms to visit on the tour. There's lots of historical items with info about them, again with several more rooms to tour then the other missions, and of course the chapel is just fantastic to view as all the other missions, not to mention a wonderful place to stop and take a moment to worship or reflect. An added viewing point of this particular mission is the burial place for Bob ( Leslie ) Hope and his wife Dorothy in the Hope garden just outside the chapel.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/richardsC7805SY
50,Mission project field trip for our son,"Our son picked this mission for his 4th grade mission project and since we were traveling we decided to come see it. It was awesome for him to see everything he has read about in person. He was like our little tour guide. It has alot of history and artifacts of thr Catholic faith. Some were a bit creepy but it's all apart of their history. The grounds are well kept, staff is nice and it's a very nice mission. Must see if in the area or for mission projects! The chapel is really beautiful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kimmirae
40,An urban Mission,"We had a pleasant surprise on our visit... a colorful wedding in progress. The facility was a little difficult to find, but it was worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/funflowertrips
40,Very Nice...Easy to Get To,"This is a very nice mission that is very easy to get to in the Mission Hills area of Los Angeles. There is a small fee of $5 for adults, $4 for seniors and $3 for children. The mission is total renovated with exhibits in the various parts of the mission and the old convent. There are exhibits on all the various activities that occurred when it was a working mission from saddle making, to wine making and weaving. The grounds are beautiful and is a wonderful place to walk. The church is simple but very attractive. The day we visited, there was a wedding. Bob Hope and his wife are buried in the beautiful Bob Hope memorial gardens. At the end of the easy to follow self guided tour is a very nice gift shop. I would allow about 1 1/2 hours to insure a leisurely visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tennessee50plus
40,Interesting Old Mission in Sunny Southern California,"A lot of Americans seem to think that everything old in the United States is in the East. This mission was established in 1797, when George Washington was President and California still belonged to Spain! Most of the displays in the self-guided tour depict the Spanish friars as loving father figures to the Indians they converted to Catholicism but the real story is a little different. Like most old Roman Catholic churches of this age, the altar is unbelievably ornate, with lots of statuary and gold and gaudy ornamentation designed to impress. Film buffs might find it interesting that the interior of part of the mission was used to represent the interior of the Alamo (which is in Texas) in the 1980s movie ""Pee Wee's Big Adventure."" Movie buffs of a slightly older generation will be pleased and perhaps surprised to learn that the famous comedian and actor Bob Hope and his wife are buried in a nicely landscaped private garden at the back of the mission grounds, which is open to the mission visitors at no extra charge. After you take a look at the church interior, go out the other door and the garden is right there in front of your. Don't overlook the big bas-relief of a smiling Bob on the garden wall!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GRANDDADGREENGO
40,Spanish California Mission 17/21 ...,"The little Mission San Fernando is tucked away in the North Valley and you won't find it unless you've out looking for it, use map & GPS. The mission is an important piece of California's Spanish colonial history & the mission building, working areas and grounds are quite interesting to tour. Not as impressive as the Missions in Capistrano or Santa Barbara, but just as historical. Enjoyable for all. ...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dblmed
40,Nicely restored mission,"I'm on a mission to visit all the missions in California and made a stop here on road trip last year. The grounds as others may have mentioned is not as pretty as some of the other missions I've visited like San Juan Capistrano or San Buenaventura. However, the buildings and the exhibits are nicely restored and give you a good sense of the history at this mission. Also, I was surprised to learn that Bob Hope was interred here alongside his wife. Still it's a good stop if you are trying to visit all the missions. However, we didn't stay here long. I did like the gift shop as they had a good variety of items, but the customer service was just ok.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/619chrissyd
50,Much improved,We were here about 8 years ago and I don't remember it being so nice. Anyone that is interested in the history of LA should come and visit. We always take people from out of the country to visit and it is always a big hit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Starviagera
40,Beautiful Mission church and Bob Hope's burial site,Our 7th mission church visited and we saw a huge courtyard and along the side we saw how the relics and how they lived.The Chapel is solemn and the sun ray hits the alter's cross that it glitters.The bonus treat for us is that this mission is also the resting of Bob Hope and Dolores Hope and their families.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/goldie75_57

50,One of the best maintained of the Old Missions,"This Old Mission is very well maintained with a beautiful Memorial Garden for Bob Hope, his wife and family members. There is a statue of the Virgin Mary with a stream, rose gardens & a manicured lawn. Well worth seeing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PtLomafoodie
10,Amazing Mission,"I was hesitant about stopping at this mission - we'd stopped at several others, but this one is special. They've done a wonderful job in reconstructing the mission. The chapel is beautiful, and they had shops demonstrating how the Indians made various products.There was a blacksmith shop, saddle shop, carpenter's shop, etc. All of the shops were nicely presented with artifacts. The museum was interesting, and we were surprised to learn of the Bob Hope Garden where he, his wife Dolores and other relatives of theirs are buried. It has a stream running in it and lots of lovely plants. That was a HUGE bonus for us to see!! The gift shop is fully stocked with lots of religious items.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marybJ6581LQ
50,Home of the First California Gold Rush!,"This 17th of the missions was founded in 1797 by Father Lasuen and named for a 13th century king of Spain - the only mission to be so named. It was also the only mission currently 'owned' by a non Native American, being on a rancho owned by the then-current mayor of the Pueblo of Los Angeles. San Fernando was a prosperous agrarian community, with around 30,000 vines and around 21,000 head of sheep and cattle. It was famed for its blacksmithing work, some of which remains in the 'long house' windows to this day. It was also the favourite place to stay for travellers along the El Camino Real. This was in large part because of the Friars' reputation for hospitality. That reputation was so widely known that the Padres had to accommodate visitors by building a 'convento' or hotel for them in the form of a 'long house' with 21 arches extending for almost 250 feet and 50 feet wide! The mission proper consisted of a simple church and quadrangle in addition to the 'long house' which nowadays makes up most of the surviving mission. There was damage in the 1812 quake which also harmed several other missions. With secularisation in the 1830s came decay. And then 'it' happened! In 1842 - 6 years before gold was discovered in Northern California - a well educated mineralogist ''Californio' who resided near San Fernando noticed some flecks of gold clinging to the roots of some onions being harvested in a field. The rush was on, and everything that could be dug up, was dug up, including the mission fields, quadrangle grounds, and even the floor of the church! A few years later this mini-rush was just a memory, but by then the damage had been done. The mission buildings were sold off, being used as a stagecoach station, warehouses and even a hog farm. By 1852 there was again a parish priest at the mission. grounds. In 1861 the mission ruins and 55 surrounding acres were returned to Catholic ownership. Restoration efforts began in the late 1890s.mmthere was a discovery in 1920 of a buried Russian American bell, probably dating from an early 19th century trading expedition from Alaska to the mission. By 1923 the mission was staffed by the Oblate Order of Fathers, and remains so to this day. There is a museum and gift shop with self guided tours, admission $4 per adult. Open 9 am to 4 pm. Masses at the mission church, Sunday 9 and 10:30. From the south, take the I-405 north to exit 71-B, you will be on Orion Avenue. Go to the first corner and turn right, the mission will be on your left. From the north, take the I-405 south to exit 72, and at the end of the ramp you will be on Rinaldi. Go under the freeway and turn right onto Sepulveda. Go,south on Sepulveda to San Fernando Mission Blvd. and turn left. The mission will be on your left., enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/etweeden
40,Early CA History,Great place for children in or entering 4th grade since their Social Studies will focus on early California life and the missions.Enter through the gift shop ($3). There is a beautiful court yard leading up to the church. There are multiple rooms with artifacts and art of the time as well as a few rooms left to look as they were in the past. Make sure you walk out of those rooms and into the back to see the living quarters. There is a small house (towards the parking lot) and the big building you see off of San Fernando Mission Blvd.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CMT504
50,17th Mission of 21 - Must See,"Built in 1797 and named in hoot of King Ferdinand III of Spain. Another must see on the ""mission trail"". Largest free standing adobe in California! Completely restored to its original purposes featuring a covento and workshops. Church altar statue of Saint Ferdinand imported from Spain 300 years ago! Beautiful, peaceful garden with fountain. Surprisingly, Bob Hope and his Wife are interned in a special well maicured garden to the side of the church!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P3487VXjohnd
50,San Fernando Mission,Beautiful and quaint. The church inside is amazing especially the altar area. Magnificent craftsmanship. The grounds are very well kept. Hidden away here are many religious relics including a piece of the Virgin Mary's veil. Five stars.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/691carys
40,Nice Mission,"The mission and grounds are very well restored and well kept. The museum, artifacts, and history are interesting. The clerk took our fees and said there would be a wedding in the chapel until noon. We took our time visiting the rest of the site but then found the chapel still occupied after 1:00. Back in the gift shop they said, well yes there is another wedding at 1:00 (and the bride was late) and another at 3:00 (and the entire wedding party is already here.) The park across the street was surrounded by 4 or 5 huge limos and busy photographers. We couldn't see the Bob Hope Memorial Garden either because you have to go through the chapel. The moral of the story is that it's a nice venue for a wedding (book well in advance and be on time) but if you want to tour the mission, don't do it on a Saturday in June.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/122scottc
40,Great day trip,"I use to go here as a kid 30 years ago and take tours. Now im bringing my kids, and not much has changed. Good history of the mission with very authentic artifacts. it's worth going at least once.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LA_Deputy
50,Wonderfully Peaceful Place,"Great gift shop, although a little pricey. The grounds are not very large and peaceful. There is a church and museum and cemetery. Bob Hope, his wife and sister are buried behind the cemetery (something I did not know about). Overall a nice place to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/raylaw323
40,Nice Respite,Stopped here on the way back from the Reagan Presidential Library. Enjoyed the early Spanish California artifacts immensely. The church is lovely. The Memorial Garden where Bob Hope and his wife are buried was beautiful. Nice gift shop.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeepFreeze63
40,Beautiful Mission,"The grounds of the mission is great and we enjoyed seeing Bob Hope's Memorial. The brook, trees and vegetation was wonderfully maintained.Inside was also nice but it would have been great if there was more information about some of the artifacts. There was a wedding getting ready to start too so that buzz had a nice feel. The church itself is structured with a very long aisle, it was dark and only one stained glass window. The altar was embellished with Christmas trees and poinsettia plants. We spent about an hour touring the grounds, church and museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Betsie49
40,History Abounds,Our group is on a mission tour of seven areas and this site is one of the most extensive. We set up a guided tour and planned Mass in the church. Amazing grounds at the Mission and across the street. Our guide was very knowledgeable but not quite flexible enough to match the needs of a limited to one hour tour and still hit the high points. There is much to see. Not a Mission to be missed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/443bruceb
40,Well-kept Mission,"It was a surprise to see how well kept this mission is. My daughter and I went there last month. It was a short visit. There were a few visitors which is great... Loved their gift shop, I think they have better selection of items compared to others. We also liked the Bob Hope Memorial Garden, love the flowers and the small pond...I just learned too that they rent the place for weddings and other events. This is my fifth mission... so off to 16 more :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tameia
40,Beautiful Mission,On our way home from a trip down the coast we decided to stop at the San Fernando Mission.What a beautiful mission ! It is probably one of the best preserved missions that I've seen in California. There are many buildings with lots of exhibits. It was very peaceful here. Hardly any visitors. There is a beautiful garden where Bob Hope and his wife are buried. Next door to the mission is a Catholic cemetery where Ritchie Valens is buried.I think this mission is often overlooked. Visitors to California or visitors in California that want to see the missions should stop here. The gift shop is not that large but be sure and pick up a postcard.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Default33009
30,Stop if you want to collect the complete set of 21,"As I travel California, I'm planning to finally stop at every mission. I only have a handful left.I don't believe this to be one of the prettier missions (San Luis Ray, Santa Barbara, Carmel and Santa Clara are all nicer). It's not the most historically interesting (I like San Juan Bautista for that). As for iconic, not much tops San Juan Capistrano. It is one of the best restored and is worth a visit. The restoration (rebuilding, really) is impressive considering the complex was down to one crumbling building and piles of bricks.Bob Hope is interned here along with family if that matters to do.They have collected a lot of artifacts which are housed in building. Realize that not much of it is from the mission. Donations have been from everywhere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tennisbump
50,Serenity,"These California missions are just beautiful! The architecture and surrounding gardens are a credit to the folks who maintain them. The museum, chapel and gardens in this one are just wonderful. We arrived about an hour before closing and really needed more time. I hope to return and spend at least a half day here. A very minimal fee to enter.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rodgerskay

50,Great SoCal Mission,"We had an opportunity to visit one of the many California missions today. This was part of a school project for my grandson. Since I live in SoCal, I have already visited many of the other missions but not this one. Much of the style is the same but there were enough unique differences that I would highly recommend a visit. The grounds alone are beautiful. It's like a college campus. It's easy to reach from the 5 freeway & plenty of parking. Well worth the $5 adult admission.Also, much to my surprise, Bob Hope & his wife are buried there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sam651
30,Worth the visit....,"Every year our family would visit a mission. This year, we decided to visit San Fernando Mission. A food half hour drive dr where we live. The ground are quite wide compared to some that we've before. The museum is worth a visit because of different items in display. I personally like the china collections. Not a lot of people during our visit and we have the time to sit around the grounds and talk. A good place to visit if you're interested in the history of the mission.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/neborr357
50,"Driven by, never stopped & wish I had!","I was always rushing by the Mission heading up or heading down I-5. Never stopped to smell the roses, until now.This time, we were on a Mission to see the Missions. We stopped by and enjoyed the last light on the colonnade late in the afternoon and decided if there was time on our way back from San Diego and San Juan Capistrano, we'd stop by. Two days later, we did.After years, I'm sorry I have never stopped here. The colonnade betrays the rest of the site since Mission San Fernando is much, much larger. This is the south wall of the old convent and is one of several wings open to the public and stuffed with neat artifacts, Santos, history both of the Mission and its community. Many things not related to its history are on display and that's fine, because it tells about the parishioners who have attended since the 18th century and this gives a more complete picture of the spirit of the site.However, there's lots and lots of artifacts here, enough to spend a few hours. The chapel is quite large and the altar is nice and ornate like some I've seen in Mallorca.All in all, take the time to spend a few hours there. You'll be glad you did!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lazo1894

50,One a Mission,"I've forgotten how many times I 've visited this Mission, number 17 in order of founding in California. It doesn't have a large grand bell tower, but a simple wall with bells. The Mission Gardens are across the street. What is most often remembered is the colonnade along San Fernando Boulevard. Behind the colonnade is the large building with many of the exhibits. This building is not part of the 3/4 quadrangle (4 sides, but one side is missing) which has the church on the north, entrance and shop on the south, and more exhibits on the west. I was surprised when I walked through the cemetery to find Bob Hope resting eternally.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KennethL828
50,History buffs will have fun!,"I love California history, because I love living here. A hefty bit of California's growth is because of the mission system. This example is well maintained with docents who are very knowledgeable. For you Catholics, the parish is very active and involved with the community. Peace.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Michaelin626
50,California Missions,"Of the 21 famous California Missions, the San Fernando is one of the best maintained. A beautiful place to visit! We have been to 16 of the 21.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GabrielA945
40,A great piece of California history,"This lovingly restored mission is a bit off the beaten track, but should you find yourself in the area you will not regret allowing about an hour or so to get an idea of what mission life was like. Be sure to visit the rear garden where - surprise! - you will find the lovely burial site of Bob Hope and wife, Dolores. The nearby official cemetary is the burial site of several fondly remembered entertainers, including 'Rifleman' Chuck Connors, William Frawley (Fred Mertz), George Gobel, and June Marlowe, best known as everyone's favorite teacher, Miss Crabtree of the Little Rascals.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DOD56
30,"Another California mission, but the location is not worth a side trip.",There are other missions in better settings. I would not make a detour for this place unless I was trying to complete a checklist of all missions.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TonyTraveler2010
50,"Amazing what Fr, Serra could do","Was here for the funeral of a friend of many years. All buildings are restored, but look so authentic.

40,Short Drive from LA,"We were staying in Burbank and didn't want to have to drive a couple of hours to see a ""California Mission"". So, we chose San Fernando as it was only a 15 minute drive from our hotel. It gave us a feel for what a California Mission is, as well as was close by to a cemetery with several celebrity graves. The Mission itself has a beautifully be-fitting memorial park in the back to Bob Hope -- it's also where he is buried.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vakayplannerPa
40,Historic California,Southern California and LA have a rich history that is intertwined with the Spanish exploration of America and the Mission system. San Fernando is one of the better re-made facilities that gives a great peak into life in LA in the 1800's,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cbucka
50,cool quiet inspirational way to spend a warm summer day,"God has blessed California with many beautiful sights and the missions are part of that great history. Do see this with your children so that they know that California was not always full of freeways, skyscrapers and condominiums. The beautiful grounds are lush and comforting, the self guided tour takes you through the buildings many rooms which have very thick adobe walls and are very cool even in the middle of the day. Many good California History displays, beautiful old religious art pieces, and complete rooms set up to show the living situations of the padres and the native Americans. Bob Hope and his wife are buried there in a spectacular memorial garden, not far from the church. You could spend and hour or three here and really enlighten yourself as to how far back our southern California civilization goes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vikingfuneral
40,"Beautiful gardens, huge religious gift shop","We were in the neighborhood while visiting LA so we made a quick stop here not knowing anything about it in advance. It was so peaceful, I think we were the only visitors there at the time. I had no idea that Bob Hope had a private cemetery in the back with about an acre of beautiful gardens. His grave was a bit over the top (especially after seeing other huge stars' extremely bland graves later on that trip such as Marilyn Monroe's) But it is nice that his estate pays to maintain such a nice garden.There was a museum with maps, photographs, historical costumes, etc which was interesting. There was also a church you had to walk thru to get to the gardens. It was painted with trompe l'oiel effects I will share a photo of.You must enter through a huge gift shop with many religious items. It is not my thing but everything looked very high quality and special.Pee Wee's Big Adventure filmed their Alamo scenes here :-)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ksquarednyc
40,A very accessible and worthwhile sampling of Early California,"Of all the California Missions, San Fernando is one of the most accessible yet offers a robust and stimulating glance into Early California life and the evolution of a working church in what was once a vast wheat and cattle empire. Now within a huge metropolis, this facility continues to minister to a large congregation, with daily masses and often funerals, weddings and baptisms. Yet it still manages to accommodate tourists and the curious in a relaxed atmosphere.My advice is to arrive as early as possible, even 9am. Parking fills up fast and you might have to look for a spot alongside the city park across the street. They do funnel you through the Gift Shop counter area and a $4/person donation is requested. It is well worth it as the grounds are in very good shape and the exhibits are clean, well-lit and nearly always interpreted very nicely by the exhibit cards. If the MIssion sanctuary is celebrating a service you may not be able to visit there so be prepared for that possibility.I recommend the Convento and Workshop buildings to enjoy the best sampling of stories of Mission life and relevant old maps, photos and artifacts that are presented. Some ""must sees"" I advise are 1) the Bob Hope Garden behind the sanctuary where he rests in peace. Thanks for the memories, Bob; 2) Notice in the sanctuary that the Christ depiction above the altar is not the usual crucified Jesus, but a standing tall, messianic soldier rendition.Continuing among the various highlights, 3) look for the very realistic authentic Mission wine cellar in a small basement under the Convento; 4) the unusually accurate historical diocese maps depicted in colorful mosaic motif over a tableau promenade along the Archival Center's east wall. There is also considerable emphasis on the Indios whom the Franciscan padres tried to convert and on Californio ranch life prior to the American conquest.All rooms, buildings and exhibits, and the restrooms are very clean, perhaps a leftover benefit following the visit here of Pope John Paul II in 1987. The gift shop has the usual religious accoutrements but offers some monastic music CDs and some-hard-to-find memoirs by priests and diocese officials from decades past.Bottom line: Very educational and beneficial for children, teens, parents, seniors and devout Roman Catholics. Beautiful gardens and well-kept exhibits. A good place to learn about the Missions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MonkeyOnTheWing
30,Final Resting Place of Bob Hope,"First: This place is Haunted.... the Outer Colonnade on the tiny main street across from the park.... Let's just say, it is spooky during the day, but I refuse to drive by there again after dark.Second: Bob hope is interred here in the very back of the Mission's garden in what appears to be a pink band shell. This left me feeling ""Meh!""Third: The back archway to the left of the Mission was used to film the graduation scene from ""The Banger Sisters"".Fourth: the Mission suffered from a major earthquake, so the refurbishment looks new and it is not until you get inside of the original living quarters, the nunnery & Bishop's rooms can you get a sense of history.Fifth: The Mission church is still used for mass & funerals and is well kept up.This is another Mission that can be tricky to get to, especially if you are traveling North on the 5 Fwy to get there......",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Auntie-Nanuuq
30,"Not the prettiest mission, but great exhibits","Not a very photogenic mission, but the exhibits might be the most comprehensive and the church itself seems very period. Too bad about the traffic out front and the power lines running right over the mission. Check out the garden at Brand Park right across the street too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/micchio
