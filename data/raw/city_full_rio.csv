10,“Azamara journey”,"We booked the trip of a lifetime at considerable cost for a holiday to Argentina Uruguay and Brazil. Prior to our cruise we stayed for three days at the Windsor atlantica 5* hotel in copacabana beach which was amazing we visited sugarloaf and the redeemer and were very excited about our cruise. We arrived at the terminal and there was nobody to help or guide us. My friend had a splint on her arm because she had a break falling on ice. I have a mobility disability and use a stick. When we finally struggled up the gangplank we asked if there was anywhere to sit. No. After a while we asked what to do and we told to go and find our cabin. The cabin was extremely shabby. We had to find our own way to find the restaurant for lunch. We thought this was because they were receiving lots of passengers. In day two our toilet was blocked. We spent hours at customer services during this cruise as our toilet stunk and was totally blocked and unusable for 9 out of the 12 days. 90% of public toilets were blocked. Health and safety??Nobody cared. Many other passengers were suffering but our cabin was the worst. We lost our patience when we couldn't open the cabin door the smell was horrific. We were in swimwear in the lobby for hours whilst the cabin was deep cleaned. Still no improvement. The talk was that this had never happened before and their head office were arranging a formula for compensation. We said we would not leave the ship without a resolution. We went to the cabin service director ""who knew all about us"" we asked why he failed to help. We were refused an alternative cabin. Many many things were so wrong though we did meet some lovely passengers. All the last night all affected passengers mostly American were called and given compensation. They were told not to discuss their offer with us!! Our offer was pitiful and £60 off another cruise. We would never use them again. We refused in writing and were told that we would be contacted at home. We weren't. This ship is more than ready for a refurbishment the staff moral was so low. We checked reviews in our return and found this problem was apparent in January! We gave photos of the ground in age old filth in our bathroom and were still treated so badly. The formula was how much you paid the level of cabin and nothing about the level of distress. We found that some nationalities seemed to get better service than two Brits. We took action against the cruise line and won. We have used several cruise lines and this is the only one that we would advise our friends not to bother. C'mon refurbish this ship and make it 6* as it once was"
30,“Rio De Janerio-should be synonymous with 'No English' and not sex.”,"Rio-De-Jenario –The city where the largest party of the world is hosted every year as a carnival is famous for its views from Christ Redeemer and Sugar loaf was great. Once you are there it’s a great. But a weird system of booking which had to be done personally at the tourist office at Copa Cabanna and could not be done on the net led me to a lot of harassment.i loved the Coppa cabbana beach for the vastness of its beach area and broad roads outside the beaches. The lit up ‘Favelas’ [slums] that are concentrated in one area looked like a huge Christmas tree from Leblon and Ipebama beach in the evenings with . I was truly fascinated with this view.Vegetarian food [Especially around Centro region] where I stayed was a problem . I survived mostly on topiaccano, Churros and bread/and cheese and Indian snacks brought from home. Dying to have hot food, at one instance I had entered a cafeteria and asked for bread, chips and omelette as shown in the picture [ due to language problem] and got ham in my omelette!!!. Language is another problem as most people don’t speak and understand even the simple English words.They are not even interested in trying and ignore you if you try to ask anyone in English. This indifference really hurts you as a tourist. I was there at the time of Carnival where all the people of the world have gathered and most had the same story to share. I landed playing dumb charade but then felt like banging the head on the wall as it was too much of work and waste of time. Google translator or a dictionary is a MUST.. But I still have not understood why is Rio synonymous with sex?? I never saw bikini babes at beaches [ but black fat families] as advertised . Despite the poor woman to man ration , women are not easily available as believed. If one has enough time to spend there, time it would be fun to go to Samba schools and learn some steps."

We HIGHLY recommend Andrew!!!-Lance & David"
20,“Marvelous city but watch out for debit and credit card fraud”,"I'm a frequent traveler to Rio de Janeiro and it is one of my absolute favorite places in the world. I've always been careful with my debit/credit cards and never had issues until now. Be VERY vigilant when using ATMs. I returned from a recent business trip two weeks ago and found out that someone made several withdrawals totaling nearly US$3,000 this weekend. I didn't even lose my card in the first place! How they exceeded the daily limit I don't know, and I suspect the thieves used false card readers and hidden cameras to capture my account information.Some tips:Use only ATMs inside established banks where there's lots of traffic and where they have guards posted outside the premises, or where you need to swipe your card to get in.Standalone ATMs, even those belonging to the large banks like HSBC, Bradesco, Itau and Banco do Brasil, etc., may be compromised. See tip #1 above. In hindsight, I suspect that some of the ATMs at the international airport in Rio de Janeiro may have been rigged. They're located on a quiet corner of the third floor with sparse foot traffic. Very easy for thieves to install skimming devices without anyone noticing.Cover your fingers as you type your PIN even when there's nobody behind you. There may be hidden cameras mounted in the premises and thieves can identify your pin from the video.Check your online statements often. Use credit rather than debit cards to withdraw cash.That said, Rio is still a fascinating place and I would go back there in a heartbeat. Just be extremely careful where money is involved."
50,“The best week of my life!”,"Spent an amazing week with my now fiancee (I proposed in Rio!) in my now favourite city in the world! I went to Rio with the same misconceptions most 'gringos' have about the place but found it to be an amazing city.I don't think I have ever packed so much in to one week in my life!The Copacabana beach was amazing - beautiful white sands, warm sun and cool water (it was winter in Brasil when we went) Dotted up and down the beach are various little snack bars where you can get everything from a beer to a full lunch while you relax watching the world go by.A visit to Sugarloaf Mountain is a must. The cable car (or Teleferico) is an amazing trip with incredible views of the city. That is nothing compared to the views from the top of the mountain...breathtaking. The price is a little steep but the view more than makes up for that.Christ the Redentor was amazing - the statue is far bigger than I imagined it to be. We took a bus from the Copacabana to the bottom of the statue and hired a local tour bus for a reasonable amount to take us up to the top. You stop halfway up at the heliport where you get a great view before carrying on up to the top of the mountain where the statue is. It was reasonably priced at approx 20 Reals per person.A visit to the Lapa district at night is well worth it too! A double aquaduct towers above the entrance to the street and looks amazing lit up at night. The area has a dazzling array of bars where you can get reasonably priced food and drink and listen to live Samba music all night! I would recommend some of the smaller bars - the atmosphere is amazing!I cannot recommend Rio highly enough... it was a friendly welcoming city and we saw no sigh of any crime or trouble in any of the places we went.!"
50,“One of my favorite cities”,"This is my second trip to Rio. The first one was 35 years ago.They were not speaking English and they still don’t. One of the famous cities in the world and service sector still do not speak any other language but Portuguese. Unbelievable!Apart from this it is a lovely city with night life, nice restaurants and beaches.Nothing much to see in down town (Cinelandia). You can take Metro to Cinelandia station. The metro station in Cobacapana is Sigueira Campos.Sugar Loaf (Pao d Acucar)( 44 reals per person) When you are in that area walk the lovely streets of URCA. Also, on the left of the bay where Sugar Loaf station is, there is a lovely paved trail Pista Claduio Cautinho. There is a lovely view and you can see Capuchin monkeys. Bus number from Copacabana is 511 and return 512.100 reals : 60 US dollars appx.Corcovado (Christ the Redeemer-Christo Redentor) If you want the take the tram the name of the name of station you have to give to the taxi driver is Rua Cosme Velho, otherwise he will take you up if you only say Corcovado (do not forget they do not speak .... Eng,Fr,D etc) The tram and the entrance ticket price is total 36 reals per person. If you take a taxi up to the hill the entrance fee is 25 Reals. You can ask taxi driver to wait for you for a discount of 20 or 25% of the total fee (I have done this)Taxi from Copacabana to Corcovado is 25 reales.( US$ 15)"
40,“Great Beaches”,I was amazed at the beaches in Rio. I was thinking they may be dirty and not pretty. Boy was I wrong. We read about all the crime there but we did not have any problems.
50,“So great I have moved to Rio!”,"Great city to visit. Most will tell you to visit during summer time, but city is simply too hot. The sun is shinning most of the year and you can have as much fun when hotels are not so expensive and city not so crowded. The best beach to stay is Ipanema, and I strongly suggest to - before choosing the spot to stay at the beach - to walk by the sand to see the different crowds that enjoy the beach. The best place is the area between lifeguard station 9 and 10 (or ""Posto"" as they reefer in portuguese). Some tips bellow:1- Find a hotel in the South Zone of the city (Ipanema or Copacabana);2- You MUST go to the Christ Statue, you can take a cab that will leave in the entrance of the park, from where you take an authorized mini van that will transport you to the base of the escalators that take you up to the base of the statue. If you opt to take the train up and down, it takes about 2 hours (40 mins waiting going up, 30 mins enjoying the view and about 40 mins to wait and come down);3- Sugar loaf is another must, there is a cable car to take you up and is quite safe for everyone;4- There is a company that offers Helicopter rides over Rio. DO IT! The cheapest option is a 10 minute flight and costs about USD 160. This is the best way to see Rio, and they have a Helipad on the top of Sugar Loaf;5- One of the largest slums in the world is in Rio, and is called ""Favela da Rocinha"", your hotel can arrange tours to visit it and you get to visit how 20% of the population of Rio lives. The tour is safe, and very interesting. There a lot of walking involved, so do not do it if you have any limitation. DO NOT go on a favela alone. Pay for the tour;6- If you are into sports, try hangliding and climbing in Rio. The city is all about these two sports (besides soccer);7- If you are in Rio outside the carnival period (Carnival is on Feb or March), there is a place called ""Cidade do Samba"" (city of samba) where the dancers give a show every week and is worth going;8- Nightlife happens in a place downtown called LAPA. One of the best places to go is called Rio Scenarium, which is an old warehouse that become a club;9- Go to a ""Churrascaria"" I recommend Porcao Rios, the best barbecue place in town;10- For afternight cool locals go to a pizza place called ""Pizzaria Guanabara"" for the last beer and a slice of pizza before calling the night. The place is awesome, all different kinds of people having fun.Rio is a place for all ages, most places you go will notice a mix of older and younger people, all getting along. This is one of the best qualities of people in Rio, they all get along!"
50,“The Marvelous City Indeed”,"The feeling of being in Rio de Janeiro is indescribable. Sure, before any criticism arises, there are its faults as there are in any city. The violence and the favelas are not the most pleasant of all sights, but the city is gorgeous, no matter from where you see it. When I say Rio, I am speaking about the “Zona Sul” (which is actually the smallest area of Rio), however the most famous. It is this zone which is home to some of the most famous beaches in the world: Copacabana and Ipanema. There is nothing like waking up in the morning to the spectacular view of the ocean, and going for a run up and down the Ipanema/Leblon beach. The city is super sport driven, with bike tracks all over town, a huge lagoon for watersports, and of course the beach with volleyball, football (soccer), and surf! This healthy culture, promotes juice stores on every corner of town and fabulous trends and outfits sported by the most beautiful people. Don’t get me wrong though, cariocas love there “chopp” (draft beer) and “boling de bacalhau” which are not all that healthy. Plus, the people of Rio (The Cariocas) are super friendly and fun, and not to mention beautiful. As you probably can tell, I love Rio, its defiantly a must go!"
40,“Trip to Brazil - Different than I thought”,"At the end of March and beginning of April my 20 year old daughter and I went on holiday to Brazil. We spent 5 days in Rio, 3 days in Iguazu Falls and 4 days in Salvador.First of all I want to say that before we went everyone was scaring us to death by telling us how dangerous Brazil is. I want to dispell this myth and say that we felt completely comfortable, even walking around at night. Of course we were in nice or touristy areas, but use your common sense and you'll be fine. I was also very pleasantly surprised at how clean Rio was, especially the beach area and the public bathrooms. Thumbs up to the work crews.I was disappointed because we went after Carnival and the lack of music or street entertainment was not something I had anticipated. The locals said everyone was tired after Carnival. I guess I expected it to be more like Cuba or the Dominican Republic where apparently the bands don't get tired; even after thier carnivals.I was also surpried at how expensive Brazil is. I had always heard it was relatively inexpensive, but it turned out to be one of the most expensive vacations I have ever taken and I have been all over the world and never stay in less than a 4 star resort.I also couldn't beleive that the people there really don't speak english for the most part or even spanish. I had a real struggle with the few portugese words I knew.Highlights included Hotel Das Cataratas in Iguazu. A luxurious oasis with a view of the falls. We especially liked the nature park on the Arentinian side.Loved Rascals Restaurant in Shopping Leblon. Great salad bar and pizza. Loved Restaurante Yemanja in Salvador - very authentic, local food. Lots of decent sushi places in Rio such as Manekineiko and Sushi Leblon, but very expensive.Loved our lunch at Copacabana Palace Hotel Restaurant - a piece of history but also pricey. Did not like the Sheraton Rio Hotel. It was too big and too American and very far away from al the action. Would recommend staying either on Copacabana or Ipanema beach.Could go on and on, but basically, I wasn't impressed with the beaches. The water was very rough. I much prefer Cuba or Dominican Republic or the carribean side of Mexico. The people were very nice all over, but not enough to make me want to run back there. It was also very humid."
50,“Like another planet”,"Rio is such a bustling, vibrant, beautiful city with tons of different attractions and ways to experience the city. On our trip we visited SugarLoaf Mountain, Christ the Redeemer statue, biked around the lagoon in Ipanema, spent time on the Ipanema and Copacabana beaches, ate all kinds of cuisine and enjoyed a late night at a samba club. Each experience had its own magic and the city is a big part of the experience. If you see South America just once, don't miss a chance to see Rio de Janeiro while you're there."
50,“Amazing Rio”,"I had many concerns before leaving for a 10 day trip to Rio de Janeiro, but on the return flight I could only dream about the amazing time in Rio. It is truly a significant, amazing and beautiful place - not to be missed by any serious traveller.Yes, there is poverty and yes the crime may be a bit higher than in the Vatican City, but I experienced no problems and never felt any danger whatsoever. I did not even see anything to make me feel uncomfortable.I stayed in the Ibis Hotel Rio Central, right downtown, and I still felt safe and happy with my decision to not pay the high hotel prices of the beaches. Downtown Rio is a pleasure to explore; it is vibrant and the markets are awesome. There are also amazing buildings with awesome architecture - especially now that the City is investing in infrastructure and renovations for the Olympic Games and Worldcup in 2014 and 2016.Sugar Loaf Mountain and Christ the Redeemer are woldclass attractions and the view of the city breathtaking. The parks and botanical gardens are exceptional and the beaches, yes the Brazilian beaches......... what more do I have to say.The only negative point was the language barrier where I struggled a bit to communicate. English is not widely spoken and even my hotel struggled to help me with tourist and travel information. My advice - come pre-prepared with all your travel and tourist information. Although the public transportation is excellent and easy to use, it did take a while to get use to it - especially to communicate where to get off.The best thing I did was to bring my GPS and city maps - I switched it on in the morning and just went exploring without worrying about getting lost. It saved me many times getting lost and waisting time. With all the mountains in Rio, the City is fragmented and could be a challenge to explore unless you are well prepared with maps and knowledge etc.The favelas (shanty towns) in Rio is not a problem at all. They are easily identifyable areas to stay away from, unless you do an organize trip.Don't forget to try the hang gliding...Otherwise, just have fun."
10,“tours gone wild Rio de Janerio”,I used the Tours Gone wild in Rio de Janerio. It was a horrible experience. I was charged way to much by the company. I paid to go to the March Carnival. I asked them well in advance for the dates. They booked me for the last two days of the carnival. Without a explanation. It was an awful experience. I do not recommend them to no one.
50,“The greatest city on Earth...Rio de Janeiro”,"I have been traveling all my life and recently after graduating college I have made trips once or twice a year out of the states. Recently, I traveled to Rio with a few buddies for a week just to get away and get some beach time in. Little did we know we were in for the greatest vacation and the most fun any of us have had in a week, and I've spent a week in Cancun, Costa Rica, Key West, Dublin, Honolulu and a few other places known for a great time. We spent most of our time in Ipanema Beach mostly staying in hostels and one night in a hotel. Also, we traveled to Ihla Grande, the big island of the coast of Rio de Janeiro. Every day we woke up around 9, had free breakfast at each place of stay, and hit up the beaches, the many sights to see, and stayed out til 4 or 5 in the morning at the great restaurants and clubs all over Rio. The highlight of the trip for me was meeting a local that had moved to Ipanema from California years ago. He owned a kiosk on the beach and knew all the locals, including guys that worked for him that were from the favela Rocina. One night, he and his guys took us to Rocina. We drank at a few tiny bars and walked around before we all jumped on motorcycle taxi's and flew through the streets of the biggest favela in Rio to the top where we all met for more drinks and great stories. During our stay in Rio we met some of the craziest but fun loving people we have ever met. After arriving back in Atlanta, where we all grew up, my friends and I agreed that was the best vacation any of us have ever had. I highly recommed anyone including families to visit RIo, ecspecially single men. Wink wink-Travelin Light"
50,“The most beautiful and exciting place I´ve ever been!”,"A great and amazing city in a natural paradise! When travelling abroad you always ask yourself: how would be my life if a lived here? When in Rio, that´s simply impossible not to imagine - and even seriously desire - this possibility! An unique cultural great city, full of wonderful landscapes, nature, entertainement, history, interesting and happy people. About the so called violence in Rio, the risk is slightly higher than usual big cities, but not much more. The most exciting place I´ve ever visit."
50,“Rio De Janerio is a great city”,"We have just returned from a trip to Rio de Janeiro .After reading a lot of blogs and guide books we set off.My advice to anyone going to rio is1. Dont worry about what to wear anything goes (men do wear trunks but they wear shorts and board shorts also,get a sarong off a beach seller and when going out just be neat and tidy no fuss)2. You can take cameras on to the beach (just be aware of your surroundings like in any big city)3.Go on a favela tour its an eye opener4.Take the yellow cabs they are all on metres,public buses are great and the metro is also good. (we never had a bad experience in any taxi ,metro or bus)5.All the local beach sellers are trying to earn a living they are polite and will leave you alone if you just say no.6.Go to lapa for a friday or saturday night ( Rio scenario is a great place with dancing and food in many rooms)7.Remember its hot put on lots of sun cream.9.Copacabana and Ipanema are well lit at night and well policed24/7 you can take a late night drink in any of the bars along the beach front.10.Take a frase book you will need one as not everyone speaks english .11.Drink local drinks caipirinha and eat local foods (it will save you a lot of money)Rio is like any other big city be careful and you will be safe ,people are helpful and friendly and the sun shines daily.Dont let peoples tales put you off its much safer than depicted in travel books .10."
40,“Rio de Janeiro with kids”,"I had a great experience visiting Rio de Janeiro on Febrary with our 5 year old daughter! Brazilians have great respect for kids and they go out with them even at night.Whenever my daughter was in a queue, people say ""no, you go first"", and even let her sit when the omnibus was full (from Rio to Barra). We also went to open restaurants-bars at night (22 hrs) and she could stay. Everyone was really nice to her and no one seemed bothered because of her presence or any other kids.What I recomed:Leblon beach, posto 12 (I think), which is the kids area, they even rent small plastic swimming pools so they can cool down when they are not at the sea.The bookstores. There are a lot and kids can read whatever they like. My daughter specially liked one in the Barra Shopping where they had big cushions so kids could lay down and read!Leblon shopping. At the 4th floor they have a special area for kids to stay, it's like a small city, with a small grocerie, a small vet shop, etc. They even have costume dresses, nintendo wii, a bouncy bed. I think it was opened until 23 hrs (you have to pay 20R for every hour).Frozen Yogurts. There are a lot of places to buy them, it was a good ""prize"" for her good behaviour and she could choose toppings to put them on: fruits, m&m, etc.The Sugar Loaf. Beautiful!!! I also loved the beach next to it, praia vermelha, although it wasn`t very clean. I think it's great for kids becase the waves are really really small.Fruit. It's delicious and not expensive!What I don't recommed:The zoo. I didn't like it, it was far away, and It didn't look clean or well taken care.What to take to Rio:sunscreen and insect repelent, a jockey or a hat.What we carried:- At night, we froze bottles of water to take with us during the day (3 usually).- Sandwiches: we bought bread and ham in a supermarket (and yogurts) to make sandwiches to carry with us in case our daughter was hungry. We didn`t put mayonaise on becasue we thought that, with the heat, it wouldn`t be in good condition.- A lot of sunscreen- Spare clothes and bathing suits (you never know when you are going to be in front of a beautiful beach!).Beware of:Rio is beautifull and a very turistic place. So, we had the impression that people always want turists to give them more money. We reallized that they have some tricks to make you pay more:- We and some other turist realized that wen we pay, sometimes they gave us less change. When we said ""excuse me, I payed with 20"", they say ""no, you payed with 10"". At the beginnig we that it was ours mistake, but then we realized it wasn't.- We realized that sometimes, when we took a taxi, the driver put a ""2"" on the thing that tells you how much you have to pay. Finally, we realized that during the day they have a ""1"" fare and from 21 hrs a ""2"" fare, which is more expensive.Also, we realized that people are not very good at indications or telling you procedures. Always check with some other sources. Eg: they told us that there were no buses to go to the Sugar Loaf, but we looked at the map and realized it was in Urca, so we took a bus to Urca.For some strange reason, some cars don`t use their lights on at night (even the police!) so be carefull!Summary: we loved Rio. We really relaxed. I would love to go again. We walked a lot, ate helthier, dranked a lot of water and rested. The result: we look happier, younger and even lost some body fat!"
20,"“So, so”","With my wife we visited Rio de janeiro from November 22 to November 27, 2010Airport (GIG):As always the first impression we get is from the airport, and that was not good. We had to wait 40 mn for our luggage. the airport is small, dirty, unefficient. When checking in, be there a long time in advance because it is really slow and there are long lines.There are almost no amenities. Hard to find a coffee. We found only 2 small coffee shops with hardly 4 or 5 tables to sit.There is also a Duty free Shop with totally overinflated prices. When in transit, there is a Locker service where it is possible to leave luggage. We used it on our return from Argentina in December. Paid R$ 27 for 3 lockers.Taxis: we prepaid a taxi service from the airport GIG to Copacabana. Cost: R$ 90. It took about 45 mn at lunch time. For returning to the airport we took a yellow cab and it cost us R$ 70 only. In Rio we found taxis are abundant and generally good. People are friendly when you try to speak a few words of Portuguese, but don't expect the average taxi driver speaks any English at all. We took 4 to 5 taxis a day, on average during our visit, and we never had any problem. Average charge was 15-20 R$.City of Rio: it is a true megapolis of 12 million people. On average, everything downtown is further than you think. Generally speaking, we found almost everything to be overpriced in Rio. Good hotels and restaurants are very expensive, but beware that tax and service are included in price. We walked a lot in the city, but never at night. Even locals strongly advise to take a taxi at night, even for short distances. It seems that there is some upper class and middle class in Rio, but they live behind fences and bars. All condos are protected by outdoor bars. Not so nice! What about the atmosphere? We had expected to hear Samba, Bossa Nova, etc...and we had to quickly forget about it. Hard to find, if there is anything left.Beaches: We went to Rio to see the famous Copacaban and Ipanema beaches. Little did we know. In 2010, it is far from the pictures we had seen in the past. Street vendors are combing the beaches which seem to be occupied exclusively by Gay communities and sex-oriented visitors, up to a point it is filthy.Attractions: There are some good restaurants in Rio. Real good. I'll post reviews in the adequate section. With regard to museums, we were disappointed. MAM main interest is to see the building from outdoor. Indoor, it is almost empty of art ...and visitors. we spent 15 mn there and it was more than enough. Museum of Bellas Artes offers a good exhibition of Brazilian art. However beware there is no air conditioning and it is extremely hot and humid, to the point it is almost unbearable to stay there more than 30 mn (Although we live in South East USA, and we are used to humidity).Museu Chacara do Ceu: located in Santa Teresa, it is probably the most interesting of all. There is a nice collection of Brazilian as well as European art.Jardim Botanico: it is definitely worth a visit if you like tropical vegetation. Count 2 hrs.Panorama: Pao de Acucar is something grandiose. Fantastic, beyond expectations. Some people will think the cable car is really scary, but hold on firmly and really do it. Cost R$38 ppCorcovado is also a must do. Take the train up. It takes roughly 25 mn and costs R$44pp. Beware it can be windy and cool on top of the hill.Overall, we are happy we saw Rio de Janeiro. We never had any problem during our visit, but if we had to answer the question, do you want to go back?, we would answer probably not."
50,"“A fun day in Rio: HStern Tour, Lunch, Beach”","A fun way to spend a day in Rio is to start out by taking a tour of the HStern store/exhibit which is pretty central in Rio. A friend of mine went years ago and recommended it. You can check out some amazing stones from the area in their ""museum"" and see live demonstrations on how the stones are cut. My daughter still remembers learning what an aquamarine looks like.After the tour, we went next door to a restaurant that was started by one of the HStern sons; it has a neat architectural inside (you can also sit outside, I believe) and has some really good, healthy food to boot.We then walked along the nearby beach and checked out all the volleyball players.A really fun day in all."
30,"“Great city thanks to a great guide, Martha Vasconellas”","From Denise & Andrew, Sydney Australia.Have just left Rio after 6 days. A few thoughts for our fellow travellers which might help:Rating: Tour guide Martha Vasconcellos, Rocinha favela, Cristo Redentor - outstanding!The rest of Rio - good to OK, depending on where you are and what is happening. Note that this is a very weather-dependent city. If the sun is shining and the beach is sparkling it is great. However when the wind howls and the temperature drops, it becomes just another big city.Guide: Rio is a city which cries out for you to get around for a day or two with a guide. After our original guide Manu Peclat let us down the night before, we were blessed to find Martha Vasconcellos. This terrific individual took us on a memorable trip through the Rocinha favela as well as Centro and the city. Martha knows the people in the favela as friends and this means that she understands and more importantly respects, the people and their lives. If you are going to Rio - get in touch with Martha - she'll be a highlight of your trip!Staying: We stayed in Leblon, which although good it is a bit removed from the buzz of the city. Ipanema would be our choice next time - the beach is busier so you get more of a feel for the beach culture.Food: this was our major disappointment on two fronts. Firstly, normal day to day fare is incredibly boring. And second, we couldn't find any seafood places to eat (except for the upmarket places on Rua de Ferriera)! Amazing for a seaside city.Day to day fare - pizza & hamburgers seem to be the staples. And there is cheese on absolutely everything! For a pizza in a local pizza place expect to pay $12-$18USD for a large pizza.On the next level up you'll find the per-kilo places. These charge either a flat rate for all you can eat or per-kilo, at your option. We ate at Frontera in Leblon a couple of times and the food was pretty good - pizza, steaks, chicken stroganoff, rice dishes. A pretty good variety. Frontera charges $40Reais for all-you-can eat or $48Reis/kg - about $28 - $33USD.Above these are the upmarket eateries of Rua de Ferriera in Leblon. We didn't get into any of them but walking around we saw menus typically charging $50-60Reis/main course (abt $35-$42USD).Wine is plentiful and well priced - good Argentinian wines are widely available at supermarkets for around $15-$20USD/bottle.Sightseeing - As noted above, a favela tour with Martha or another good guide will be the highlight of your trip. Make sure you go to Cristo Redentor on a clear day - he's often covered in cloud and if that is the case, then don't bother - you won't see a thing.Do a walking tour around Centro - the old city. Lots of outstanding architecture and great laneways to explore. But again, take a guide - very hard to negotiate without one.Finally, safety - we walked all around Leblon with no problems whatsoever. Ipanema - we stayed to the main beach area, but again, no issues. The only time we felt a bit edgy was when we ventured about 3 streets back from the main strip in Copacabana - and we didn't stay there very long! But overall, no concerns with safety at all, as long as you keep your wits about you.OK, that might do - enoy Rio as we did, but just bear in mind that it is a VERY expensive city by any standard."
50,"“SUPERNATURAL, SPELLBINDING CITY”","As you drive to your hotel, the first things you may notice are the dark pink tropical clouds.You may pass seedy bars near Avenida Rio Branco in the dictrict called Centro.You will observe that Rio is a city of steep little mountains and hills, crumbling villas and clanking yellow trams.After booking into your hotel, remind yourself that it is not safe to wander into certain areas.Near Centro, I met some ragged children who introduced themselves as Edison, Flavio, Ricardo and Fatima; one had the surname of Anderson.Edison sat beside me and taught me how to count in Portuguese. A Black youth, dressed in Sunday-best shirt, explained in a mixture of sign language and Portuguese, that this was an area of machine gun battles and murder.I walked along Copacabana Beach, where sky-scraping waves break on white sands, bronzed bodies play under the palm trees, sparkling yachts sail beneath steep jungly mountains and uniformed doormen guard green and gold luxury flats.At the far end of the beach I found a bar. That was where I met Hilton, a retired Brazilian airforce warrant officer. Over beer and sandwiches, Hilton explained that he had worked for two years in Manchester. He took me to his luxury flat, to show off his English furniture, English wallpaper, and English beer mats. Hilton's daughter has had her photo in the Daily Mirror and the Sun. We ate roast beef and drank some beers.I set off uphill. It was a steep climb involving steep steps cut into the rock, on either side of which were piles of rubbish and the shacks of the slum dwellers. The favela houses looked surprisingly solid, considering that they were made out of old scraps of wood. There were healthy-looking children, mainly brown and black in colour, and some of them had school satchels.The people seemed friendly in an amused sort of way. Dogs barked and birds flew about and there were some enormously large beetles scurrying about among the refuse. As I climbed higher up the mountain the view of the sea and all the sugar-loaf-shaped mountains became more annd more amazing.A black lady seemed to take pity on me. She asked three small schoolboys to guide me. They led me down through steeply wooded slopes to the more civilised part of town, and left me at a bus stop!I took the first bus that came along and ended up at the Pedro II station in Centro. This bright, clean station contained shops, live music, and cafes selling sorbets, sundaes and hamburgers. I bought a hamburger and watched the silvery cooking surfaces being polished. A fair-haired, bare-footed child was swooshing water around the floor with a mop.I walked along Rio Branco avenue with its skyscrapers, its joggers, its doll-like school girls, and its street musicians. Copacabana beach was bathed in sunlight and the beach umbrellas were dazzlingly bright. But more interesting than the surf and sand were the steep green mountains with their multi-coloured shacks. I walked towards the shanty towns just behind the beach. Municipal lorries were collecting some of the refuse from the concrete chute running down the mountain between the slum houses.I entered the favela on the Morro de Cantagalo. The houses were of brick and the feeling that this was one of the more civilised favelas was increased by the presence of kids in school uniforms.Sitting down at the side of a path I began to sketch the view before me. Far to the right was a sugar loaf shaped mountain and in the far distance were islands rising steeply from the sea. Immediately below me were telephone wires, a red tiled roof, a black woman in white plimsoles hanging up washing in her yard, and a duck and a sleepy cat.Three boys, one carrying a happily chirping bird in a cage, came wandering along the sunny path and then sat down to watch me drawing.Minutes later I got mugged.The police officers grinned.I was taken down stairs to view the cells, large cages below street level. One cell was filled with tiny street urchins. The other was crowded with tough, desperate looking, black youths. I did not recognise any faces. At this point the police seemed to lose interest and I was shown the door.On the beach on Praia de Flamengo, I sat watching the Cariocas: mafia types with showy clothes, police in Volkswagens, black women in green trousers sweeping the pavements, men in straw hats selling drinks from drums under their arms, and fair haired kids doing Kung Fu.In the evening I walked to the Anglican Church where I knew they were having a Curry Supper. From the courtyard of the church I stared up at the lights of the shanty town on the mountainside. Women and children were climbing up and down carrying water containers and food.Among the throng at the Curry Supper, were Mike, from Guardbridge in Scotland, and his wife Katie. The saintly Mike and Katie offered me a bed in their luxury flat off Copacabana beach. Wonderful people the Scots!Lunch at Mike and Kate's flat was shared with a Brazilian businessman and his fiance and their small daughter. After lunch the businessman drove us in his Volkswagen up into the forested hills at the back of Rio in the direction of Corcovado, the famous statue of Christ. Through the fog we could make out the dark favelas and beside them the luxurious houses of the rich.The fog thickened and the search for Christ became increasingly difficult. The jungle seemed to close in around us and the petrol tank was almost empty. We gave up and headed back to the centre of town. Here, the businessman showed us, from the safety of the car, the attractions of the red light district.My memories of Rio: Think of the tall dark Tijuca mountains, sparkling Guanabara Bay, long-legged girls with dental floss bikini bottoms, seductive carnival music, sambas, street children hoping not to be murdered by the police ..... oil drums, bright blue walls, spiritist statues, corrugated iron, banana trees, washing lines, kids flying kites... You will be haunted by Rio's strange sounding church bells, its mists rolling in from the sea and its beautiful people."
50,“Rio in September”,"My husband and I spent 3 days in Rio. Everyone warned us of crime, but we never felt uncomfortable. Prices were about the same as US for food. Tips: we arrived at 9:30 to catch the cable car to Sugar Loaf, and there was no line. By the time we left at 11:00, the line was huge. Also, at the top, look for the monkeys that live in the trees opposite the cable car station.We went to the Plataforma show one evening, which was not worth it. We found out later that there is a samba show at the same place, which would have been a better choice.Of course, we went to the Christ the Redeemer statue, Ipanema Beach and Cococabana Beach. The weather was a bit chilly (early Sept) but the people-watching made it worth while.Our best meal was at a restaurant in the Cococabana section a few blocks from the beach. The name is the Portugese word for 'crab' something like Cancreho. We split an order of sea bass that was fabulous.The hippie fair on Sat. was fun, and a good place to buy souvenirs."
50,“Rio Rio Rio”,"One of the greates tcities in the world, a must visit for every travel buff. we ahv ebeen there 2 times and we will be again. On both occasions we stayed at the Rio Othon Palace, but next time we will go somewhere else as it is not a real 5 hotel any more. But the Copacabana has no equal and tha tis what really matters. Endless fun and excitement. Be carefull with thiefs though, on the first trip one tried with me but I wa sable to catch him and bring to the police, took half a day to finish this but it was fun afterwards. The city has lot's of restaurants but w eusually end up on the seafront places along the Copacabana, seafood is good!Rio is on top 5 favorite list."
50,“Ipanema is the best”,"Copacabana is a famous and fairly good beach, but Ipanema is more lively, local and fun."
50,“One of the most fatastic cities of the world”,"There is no better location to come for Brazil than Rio de Janeiro.It is a fantastic city, wich has a natural beauty that I don't think It is found in any other place of the world. The Statue of the Christ, that Is the biggest post card of the city is just a part of the many other things we can do there, shuch as seeing fantastic beaches and even having a tour over the city with the helicopters, wich is a fantastic experience. If you are a guy who likes the nature, try going to the Jardim Botanico, that is a huge garden with may different types of plants. I'm sure that staying without do anything in this city is a very hard thing."
50,“Rio de Janeiro - Wonderful city !!!!!!!”,Hi travelers and backpackers! I'm from Rio de Janeiro! I'd like to share some information and tips about my hometown! Feel free to ask! Have you ever been to Rio before? You don't know what you are missing! Rio is a must! Get in touch with me!Take care!Cheers!See you!wagner
50,“Rio Carnival 2010”,"An interesting breakfast at Bar Monaco before emergency shopping excursion for cooler clothes – bargain, four new tank tops for less than A$25 and two new short shorts for less than A$15! Comfortable walking clothes for the 40+ heat.Funny Story: - thought we’d ordered orange juice but received a toasted cheese sandwichFortaleza de São João (built 1618) is now called Forte de Copacabana. In 1872, the fortress was remodeled with modern weapons including 15 cannons installed. It was later renovated yet again with only the old gate and some ruins remaining. There is also a private beach for use by the military staff and a superb view of the Guanabara Bay from the fortress. (A Very Restricted area - we know this because we were very firmly asked to leave!) Either way, we walked to Guanabara Bay; after exploring and admiring the gate; had a drink at Porte Vetio; more walking around all the streets; grabbed a churro from a street stall and had ostrich kebabs for dinner at a beach bar before wandering through the night market. Caught up with the others and explored the local area – don’t think we missed a street! Huge day exploring the entire South Zone.Met the group and grabbed a mini van to take us to Pao de Acucar or the Sugar Loaf Mountain where the train to the top was established 1882. Waylaid by a guide offering a private all day tour of Rio so, why not? First stop, Dona Marta Belvedere with its wonderful views over Parque dos Patins lagoon and across to the infamous Christ The Redeemer perched at the top of Corcovado. All about for a helicopter tour around and round the statue; over the lagoon and city; along the beaches of Ipanema and Copacabana past Praia Vermelha and view of Sugar Loaf Mountain and Botagogo. Wow is all I can say! Upwards and onwards we went to Corcovado through Tijuca Forest National Park (46sq miles). At the top of this 2230 feet mountain is the Christ Redeemer statue (100 foot and 1,000 ton) standing with outstretched arms. At night, the statue seems to float. From the base we took a truck to up to the statue which also offers amazing views of the soccer temple Maracanã and the northern districts of Rio. In the distance is Niterói with its 13.9kmy bridge the Sugar Loaf. It was a beautiful clear day where you could see the Lagoa Rodrigo de Freitas in the foreground, and Copacabana and Ipanema beaches further out.Off down and out of the National Park, the largest urban reserve in the world, to the 115 foot waterfall, Cascatinha de Taunay, at the Alto da Boa Vistal near the pink-and-purple Mayrink Chapel. Onwards for lunch at Tourao – a traditional Brazillian buffet where the waiters slice the meat onto your plate from giant kebabs before driving through Santa Teresa, Downtown, Flamengo, Lapa, Laranjeiras, Humaito, around the Jardim Botanico and Lake Lagoa to Sao Conrado and Barra to watch the hang gliding, onto Leblon and Ipanema Beach and back to Copacabana. Explored the ever growing markets before enjoying pizzas at Alcazan Café ending the day with caipirinhas at our “local” beachside bar.Walked almost the entire length of Copacabana Beach today before grabbing a taxi to Lapa. Arcos da Lapa with bars and music everywhere. One of the few surviving landmarks from the colonial era, the aqueduct was was built in 1750 and once carried water from the Rio Carioca, but now is a viaduct to the Bondinho de Santa Teresa (tram) connecting the downtown area to the Santa Teresa area. With 42 arcs and at 800-feet long, it is also known as Aqueduto da Carioca and is a wonderful example of the old and new architecture seen in this area. Unaware that the street party was about to begin, we were soon swallowed in the crowds of singing, dancing, fancy dressed locals enjoying Carnaval. Bit of a major exercise escaping the crowds and no taxi to be found so we hopped on a bus and eventually arrived back at Copacabana, only to discover street parties in place here as well. All action in Rio! Joined the group and headed to “Marius” for a special Brazilian dinner in a themed restaurant so popular we had to visit a bar to pass the 40 minute wait in comfort. Costumed Brazilian dancers; costumed wait staff; themed restrooms and restaurant; delicious food and of course, caipirinhas.Took a taxi to Marina da Gloria and explored the marina, watched the boats, walked through Flamengo park, enjoyed coffes at Panificacao, wandered around the military memorial before checking out the street markets in Lapa and catching a bus back to Copacobana to get ready for the highlight of our trip – the championship parades. Dressed in our Carnival outfits, we caught up with the group for a drink and headed of to the Sambadrome for the big night of parades. The main parade of Carnival in Rio is held at the Sambodrome which is a massive concrete stadium built along Avenida Marques de Sapucai which seats 70 000 people. The parade involves more then 50.000 participants from a selected number of top samba schools competing for the championship. The themes are very diverse: they can be a myth, a historical or present event, a political or artistic personality with the lyrics, music, costumes, floats, dance, presentation, papier-mâché figures and paintings all relating to the selected theme. Found our seats and settled in at 5pm – fantastic! Lasted till 1.30 before heading home and enjoyed a refreshing caipirinhas before having a good nights sleep. Found out the next morning the rest of our group lasted the night and didn’t get home till 7.30am!Bit of a relaxing day today after a huge day yesterday. Had beef and ostrich kebabs at Mimi’s on the beach for brunch and casually explored the streets before making our way to Ipanema Beach for a refreshing swim. Never seen so many people and umbrellas on one beach at the same time – major exercise getting down to the beach let alone the water as we dodged bodies, umbrellas, blankets, chairs, eskies and anything else you can think of. Water was freezing! 40 degree temperature and icy cold water – but the surf was excellent. Decided to head for Sugar Loaf Mountain (Pao de Acucar) for the sunset views over Rio. Boarded the cable car to the top of the 390-foot mountain for superb views of the city, sea and mountain ranges, Guanabara Bay, Botafogo beach and of course, Copacabana and the statue on top of Corcovado. Lovely clear night so we could also clearly see the Rio-Niteroi bridge (13.9 km long) that links Niyrtoi to Rio de JaneiroChecked out the old open-air cable car used in the '30s.Thought we’d explore the Barra Shopping Centre famous as it is Latin America's primo mall with its own monorail system and 500 shops, restaurants, indoor amusement park, cinema, and bowling alley. Alas, it was a public holiday and all was closed. Not to worry, another short drive and we were back at the hang gliding tours at Sao Conrado beach - near Leblon - where four of us decided to risk life and limb and glide over Rio which is one of the five greatest hang gliding places in the world. What an experience to be soaring over the Atlantic rain forest, Tijuca National Park, the city buildings, houses and beaches! As it was over an hours adventure by the time we drove to the top of Pedra Bonita Rock , had our flight down and around, and then collected our DVD souvenir of the experience, it was quite late and no taxis to be found so again, hopped on a bus back to Copacabana."
50,“Best Brazil trip EVER thanks to Private Tour guide Emanuel Peclat”,"Prior to booking my trip to Brazil it was important for my girlfriend and I to do as much research as possible in regards to the safety, the right place to stay, what attractions were available and finding a trustworthy Tour guide.My friend and I are 34 and 39, both single. I am a mom and I was going to be away from my kids for 12 days so I wanted a vacation where I could relax, have fun and not worry have any safety concerns. My goal was to get home safely.I found Emanuel Peclat on Trip advisors. Rumors had it that he was a highly recommended tour guide. My girlfriend and I wanted a private tour guide, preferably one that spoke English. We noticed that he did indeed speak english and had lived in the US for 3-4 years. This made us really comfortable. We sent Emanuel (Manu) and email introducing ourselves to him and asked him for info on his recommended tours, pricing etc...We went to his website and enjoyed the blogs that were written about him. After several emails we decided to hire him for the 10 days. His pricing was extremely reasonable and he was willing to use his personal car (no tour bus) and he was willing to pick us up from the airportMy trip to Brazil was a trip of a lifetime! I owe it to Emanuel Peclat and I also should say the beauty of Brazil. Great combination.Emanuel met us at the airport as promised. Within 5 minutes I was completely comfortable with him. I couldn't wait to spend each day with him and touring Brazil.The first day he allowed for us to get settled in and walk the beautiful beaches, Rio De Janeiro and Ipanema. He advised us on where to eat and to make sure not to miss the street market on the beach. He called us several times to check up on us. He provided us with a cell phone for convenience. We walked the beautiful beaches and had the best dinner at a restaurant that Emanuel recommended. It was the freshest fish I have ever tasted. Our trip was off to a great start. Day 2 he took us to the sugar loaf and downtown. We jumped on a cable car and went to a local cafe and ate delicious Brazilian food. This is not typical for a tour guide to take tourist downtown but Manu insisted on taking us because he wanted us to see Lapa, Escadaria Selaron which is the famous tile stair steps that has been featured in several movies and music videos, Catedral de Sao Sebastiao do Rio de jeneiro. This was my favorite day. I am so glad that he did something that was outside of the norm for a tour guide. I have talked about this particular day everyday since I have been back..A MUST SEE!!I brought up the safety concerns to Manu, before I left I had such negative comments stated to me in regards to the safety and I wanted to ask him why people thought this way of Brazil. He stated to me that several years ago the government did not offer the type of social services that are offered now to the homeless. The homeless have the option to have medical care, food and shelter. This was very limited in the past. There were many evenings that my girlfriend and I walked the streets of downtown Rio and also along the beach. NOT ONCE did I feel unsafe. The people were very nice and accommodating. I will stress my point. I FELT VERY SAFE IN BRAZIL!!I mentioned the tour that I took the 2nd day but I had 8 days left of tours and learning about Brazil. Everyday Manu picked us up, drove us to the ""must see"" spots, Christ statue, town of Petropolis (this day was my 2nd favorite), Discos etc...Manu would pick us up and spend 8 hrs with us..drop us off at the hotel to shower and either take us to dinner, a show or a disco. He literally dedicated his time to us and for this I will forever appreciate him as a professional tour guide and now, friend! He made our trip to Brazil a trip of a lifetime.I highly recommend that you explore beautiful, safe Brazil and that you contact Emanuel Peclat to help make YOUR trip a trip of a lifetime!Please fel free to contact me and I will be more than happy to share my total experience with you."
50,“Guide in Rio”,"In March of 2010 I have used the service of a professional Rio guide known as Rafa (search Rafael Torres). I was impressed by his knowledge of the Rio, his sense of humor and his command of English."
50,“Augusto Naufel- Rio by Guto Tours”,"I can't say enough of Augusto ""Guto"" Naufel of Rio by Guto http://riodeguto.weebly.com/index.html. He was our tour guide for Tijuca Forest and Santa Teresa back in May 2008 when he was still working for another company. This guy has what it takes for the tour guide business as he is very knowledgeble about Rio and Brazil in general, speaks perfect English and has a super easy going attitude. I still cannot thank him enough for his thoughtfulness and patience with me during our tour as I was not feeling well and I held up the group quite a bit due to my slow walking. As a result, the tour ran much longer than scheduled but Guto was not bothered in the least as he said ""this is the natural pace in Rio"". If I ever get back to beautiful Rio, I most definitely will call on Guto."
40,“South American Escape with Peru Extension -- Globus”,"We traveled with the Globus tour group in April of 2010 for their South American Escape w/Peru extension trip. We tried to research this type of tour before signing up but found very limited reviews on-line. We are a younger couple (30y/o) who loves to travel and normally does so on our own or with friends. We decided to travel with a tour group because with limited vacation time (2 weeks) we wanted to see as much of South America as possible.Overall we had an absolutely amazing trip! The hotels were top notch and in great locations (i.e. Windsor Excelsior Copacabana and Casa Andina Private Collection hotels). The format of the tour was set up in a way that the ""major"" tourist sites were included (i.e SugarLoaf mountain in Rio, Machu Picchu in Peru) and along with city tours etc. We did have enough free time to explore on our own and supplement the main attractions with what we wanted to see. Optional excursions were available for an additional fee but most of the time we chose to see what we wanted to in order to individualize the tour.The trip was great because with so much traveling (11 airports in 14 days) most of the logistics were taken care of making moving locations a lot less stressful. For example, whenever possible our luggage was transported to and from our hotel and picked up from baggage claim. The itinerary was clearly communicated, tickets to museums, parks, etc were pre-purchased as well which saves a lot of time and energy.Our only complaint was the age of the tour group. We were the youngest by far!! While we met nice people on the tour most were 65 and older. It would be great to find a tour with transportation, major attractions included, etc but that catered to a younger audience. Overall it was the trip of a lifetime and we would do it again in a heartbeat!"
50,“What an amazing city!”,"Hvaing done lots of research before my trip to Brazil, I was concerned about the reports on Rio. Having been I could not recommend this city enough to visit!Ipanema, Copacabana and Leblon offer the most amazing beaches. Ipanema is certainly the best for people watching and a desirable and safe area to stay.The city is full of great places to eat and stay whether you are on a flashpacker or backpacker budget. The choice is yours with anything you want to eat you can have from authentic brazilian food to sushi.In addition, the night life is supreme, big clubs in Copa and Ipanema, samba clubs in Lapa. Fantastic. Just be weary when you go to Lapa, don't go unless it is a Friday or saturday night and don't take anything you want to lose.For great shopping head to Bota Fogo's malls. Also a great place to be when the rain comes down.A Favella tour is a must, as is the favella samba party on the Sunday evening. Make sure you take enough cash to buy yourself soem art work if you head to the largest favella in Rocachina. Make sure you always do it though a tour group. A good football match at the maracena is also a must see, but make sure it is a big match day. Again, worth organising through a tour group which you can organise through your backpackers, or when in a hotel there is a great guy called Tony who walks along Copa beach. He organises trips at great rates and is really friendly.And finally a trip is not complete without a trip to see Christ and the Sugar Loaf. Head up the Sugar Loaf at 5pm and get up to watch the sunset over Rio with a nice cocktail in hand.After dark, make sure you get cabs everywhere, don't walk along the beach or stumble into areas that you don't know. If you look confident and are street smart there will be no trouble.For those of you thinking about a trip to Rio, don't think twice about it. It is an awesome place to be."
50,“Had a Blast In Rio”,"We just returned from a two week Rio/Iguassu/BA trip and we were very impressed with Rio. It's a beautiful city and we went in April so it was great weather. We stayed at the Windsor Excelsior on Copa which was very nice with a great breakfast. The beach was fun with the various vendors stopping by to sell items.Hang gliding with JustFlyInRio is a must do activity. We'd never done any adventure sports so it was scary at first but it's a once in a lifetime experience to be soaring 2,000 ft over the trees, houses, ocean, & beaches of Rio.We also attended a soccer game at Maracana which I highly recommend. Best fans you'll ever see. If you go, stay for the whole game and don't leave early like we did as there were a couple of issues that we could have avoided if we left with the crowd.We also took the Favelatour.com.br which was a very eye opening view into the favela's without feeling too voyeuristic. There is a school in one of the favelas that is funded by the proceeds from the tours.We had previously traveled only in the US and western europe and Rio is definitely not as ""polished"" as many of our usual vacation spots. We didn't walk around as much at night due to the mugging warnings on TA but we still ended up enjoying it immensely."
50,“Rio - Great!”,"I went to Rio for an 8 day vacation in April, after those rains that closed down the Christ the Redeemer statue and I must confess that my primary concern was safety, after reading news on the subject. To my surprise it was nothing like I expected. I always felt safe and carried my camera everywhere I went and never felt threatened or found anyone suspicious looking at me and never saw anything out of the normal. My wife also carried her bag everywhere we went. The locals told me that the whole violence thing is overhyped. Of course, we always stayed in the touristy south part of the city, near the beaches and Sugarloaf.We had no reason to go anyplace else in the city. We also never stayed out past 11pm. The result is that I now know where to return next year also! This is clearly one of the most beautiful cities on earth.I'm not saying you should go and flaunt yourself, but just don't be taken in by any negative stories. From what I saw, a lot of other tourists there also figured this out."
20,"“Rio, a great disapointment!”","Rio de Janeiro has beautiful scenery and views, if you can get to the places to see them!Rio was a big disappointment to us as it was too crowded with tourists (a continuous problem all year round), long line ups for the popular sights and, as was Santiago and Buenos Aires, was covered in graffiti. Graffiti seems to be a South American malaise which is very sad (far worse than most North American cities), as the cities are architecturally beautiful, yet the local city governments appear not to care or be doing nothing to clean it up or address the issue.Rio is also expensive and very unsafe. We were continually being warned not to wear rings, jewellery, watches, back packs and to carry minimal cash and only 1 credit card. Some area’s of the city are really bad and unless previously warned, can prove detrimental to ones safety.Overall, Rio is expensive, unsafe, too crowded and poor value for money. I only wish I had visited 30 years ago, when it was a wonderful place to visit.Bottom line, Rio was very poor value for money, and I will never t visit Rio again."
50,"“so beautiful,but be careful”","We stayed in Rio,Copacabana for 9 days.I am Australian and my girlfriend is Brazilian.However she has only been there once when she was young.Before we left we were warned to be careful by her family about muggers including taxi drivers.Well we had a great stay and saw all the usual tourist attractions.Rio is truly beautiful and so much to see and do.The reason for me to say be careful is we witnessed first hand a mugging only metres from us.The muggers used a very big machete robbing an elderly couple from France.Do not wear any jewellery at all when out and if you need to carry a bag carry it in front of you,ladies try not to take a bag out with you ever.do not carry large sums of money,use a credit card,or carry your passport their is no need.AND STAY OUT OF ALL THE TUNNELS.if you are smart you will have a great holiday,rio is very very beautiful,good luck,stay safe"
40,“Rio enjoyed”,"We flew to Rio de Janeiro on March 4, 2010. We stayed at the Araopor Inn on the Ipanema Beach.The location was excellent. The front desk staff was very helpful ( had English speakers) in getting info on where to visit and what to see. Breakfast was very good and included in the price. It seemed expensive, but we were paying for the location.Weather was excellent 85 - 95 everyday for a week. We went to local places. The food and service were good.We also stayed at the Flamengo Hotel for a few days. This was a few blocks from the beach and in a more common part of the city. Service was excellent. Sidewalk cafes were very tasty and reasonably priced. Local busing made it easy to get around. Locals were helpful in assisting us.The locals were fairly friendly and kept reminding us to not look like tourist.The ""Plataforma"" had a few good acts, but too much seemed liked a Las Vegas girlie review - lots of T & A.Good time."
40,“Taking a Taxi on arrival to Rio- What I would do differently”,"Don't be afraid of the taxi drivers that walk up to you when you leave customs. I was afraid of them so after I got about 300 reais (hay-ice) from the ATM upstairs and to the left, (About 175 US dollars) I went back to the area outside of customs where there is a counter with 4-5 taxi companies with identical posted rates for Rio Barrios, ie Ipanema, Copacabana and Leblon all cost the same- about 80 reais ($45 US). I thought this was high but I justed wanted to have some peace. On the way back, I took a metered yellow taxi back to the same airport for 1/2 as much. My friend was horrified when I told her how much I paid for the cab right FROM the airport.*You should learn some very basic portuguese words and phrases and probable responses to the questions you are asking.The price of everything was very high by US standards. The exchange rate is not in our favor (Americans). It seemed everytime I went to an upscale restaurant I didn't leave w/o spending at least $50 US but frequently- $100.If you love beaches, you'll love Rio. If you are more into swimming than sun worshipping, I was told that the water isn't very clean and there is a strong undertow."
40,“Rochina Favela”,"In February 2010 I was in Rio for Two weeks, and I did all of the usual tourist things, and I found myself completely in love with this place. I wanted to see other aspects of Rio, and in particular the Favelas. I had been warned so much about Crime and violence in Rio before I left home (Australia) that I was excepting to discover it a lot, in fact I felt completely safe all the time I was there. I walked back through Copa and Ipanema in the early hours of the morning after clubbing, alone and had no problems at all. So where is the ‘dark side’? I had a bit of an ethical consideration about experiencing other peoples poverty as a tourist entertainment, but as I also work in media, and I am reviewing my travels on air, I was able to but my conscience to rest. I did a favela tour organised by a travel agency. They took us to Rochina. It was interesting but I got the feeling it was manicured and directed to the point is was not a ‘real’ experience. I saw enough though to get the impression of what it is like, and I was most surprised to find that the people (even when I was accidentally separated from the tour) were friendly and unlike people living in poverty in (say) Asia, they were generally happy. I did not get the feeling of hopelessness that I had when I found myself in really poor parts of India and South East Asia. It is evident that there are massive problems in Rio. It is also evident though that the separation of social class is not as clear cut as it is in other cultures, and that there is a great deal of respect in the middle class for the poorer class. I found most of the people in Brazil to be very friendly, outgoing and helpful. The thing that struck about the people in the Favela is their sense of pride and dignity and how happy they seemed to be with so little, a timely lesson I think. If you go to Rio, it’s worth visiting the favelas but be careful, I can see how it would be dangerous."
50,“Always have Rio in my heart!”,"Just one word, perfetto! My favorite place in the world, Copacabana is the place where I fell in love, and am still in love, so how can I forget Rio?But above all, the view was breathtaking, one side is the ocean, the beaches. The other side is the mountains. Go to Corcovado, go to Tijuca forest, go to Santa Teresa, go to the beaches, Copacabana, Leblon, Ipanema, go to see Carnaval, Rio has it all.If Rio were a man, then it definitely would be the pinnacle of men that I would marry! Haha!"
50,“Guides for Rio de Janerio”,"The various reviews for Manu, a Rio guide, and his friend Carlos are true. We spent four days wtih Manu and Carlos in early December 2009. They were both friendly and quite knowledgeable. Their English is excellent. They gave us four full days plus of excellent service in seeing both the standard as well as the little know sites we would never have found on our own. They knew the easiest ways to access the crowded ""must see"" sites. Carlos' deep knowledge of Petropolis is an illustration of the depth of their knowledge of Rio; a city they obviously love.In summary, the $160/day we paid them is one of the great travel bargains we have found;."
20,“Be aware!”,"We used apartmentrentalsinrio.com for our 10 day vacation rental. ""Do not use"", they did not give us the apt. we paid the deposit for. Apparently someone else pay more for it and we ended up in a low quality place. Then we took the Day In Rio Tour which was a desaster, they make it sound great but in fact you can actually ride the public bus/metro and do it yourself for 1/4 of the price, the tour Co. is very disorganized,. thats all i can say.Be aware Rio is not a very clean city, the smell of pee on the street can b overwhelming at times and it rains sometimes all day... we had to go to the Christ twice because of the clouds and rain in the 1st try. We took the bus (R$2.50) the 2nd time and it was just fine... not dangerous at all.The beach was the best part... we went every day and spend the days just under the sun. Food is great as well all tho. the service is slow... I speak portuguese so it was easy to order for me, so learn some if you decide to go cuz there is not a lot of people that speak english. FYI some rest. have menus in english.Over all I will go back but in a low season, cuz New Years was just crazy (traffic, waiting lines for everything, etc.) Copacabana fireworks were great too. But if I go 4 new yrs I rather see it from a hotel rooftop."
50,"“Rio, why to go!”","Rio de Janeiro is teh second biggest city in Brazil. It´s known as ""Cidade Maravilhosa"" (Marvellous city) and that´s definetely true!Rio has much more than beachs and girls to offer. Rio has history, culture, amazing food and breathtaking views. Since the sea untill the mountains, since the big urban center untill the forest, since the ""cariocas"" (Rio´s Native) untill the tasty food. Yoou will experience the hot and most amazing place in the planet.Rio has everything to offer, night, sports, adventure, culture and music!Between the many places to go, you MUST GO to Corcovado, Suggar Loaf and Maracanã but don´t let to go to ""not touristic places"" like Barra da Tijuca and its beautifull beaches, Recreio (in Macumba beach) and in Grumari a fantastic beach close to Recreio.Take a guide of Rio and have to most amazing fun at all!"
50,“Fun place to visit”,Recently visited Rio at the end of November. Went to Copacabana and Ipanema Beaches. Great to sit there and watch the action. You will be continously solicited to buy food or goods from the locals. Went to Sugarloaf and Corcovado which were worth the trip. Went to the Plataforma show. Booked it from the hotel which is the same price and includes transportation. This was great and better than expected. The entertainers were wonderful and the costumes were unbelievable. Had a great time in Rio. Remember to save the immigration sheet that you are left with upon entering. Keep it in your passport. You will need it when you leave Brazil so that you can reenter in the future.
50,“A very pleasant surprise”,"We had been planning to visit Rio for a few years. Every time we wanted to visit Brazil, the rumours about violence in Brazil made us change our destination. Finally, this year we decided to face the rumours and the exacerbated news flashes.We arrived in Rio and were instantly overwhelmed by the beauty of the place and its weather. The first few hours were tense because we expected to be subject to some kind of violence. Gradually, we began feeling more and more relaxed and we decided to set our fears aside and explore the place.We felt at ease and safe. The law enforcement agents were visible but not intrusive. People felt kind and had an easy smile. The laid-back atmosphere was palpable and we soon began understanding what we had been missing all this time! Rio is a huge city, perfectly suited for any tourist wanting to spend some great time on one of the prime vacation destinations in the world.We had hired the services of a Manu Peclat, a Brazilian official tourist guide with whom we ended up spending most of our time in Rio. He took us to the most beautiful places this city has to offer and was extremely nice and available for last minutes changes to our programme. Manu knows Rio intimately and provided us with a very different perspective of his city. We've been to places that everybody knows (Redeemer Christ, Sugar Loaf, Tijuca's Forest) but, at his suggestion, we also went to places less visited by tourists.We can say that we fell in love with this city (and country). Contrary to what we heard and read, and provided you adopt the appropriate common sense measures that you would take in any other big city as New York, Paris, London, etc., we had one of the best vacation ever! People are extremely friendly and nice, the sights are fantastic and the weather is great. As for the rest, we think everyone should give Rio a chance to prove itself and experience one of the best times ever."
50,“Rio - how to have the most incredible time!”,"The way to have the most incredible time in Rio is to hire a tour guide(s). We just returned from Rio on November 7th, 2009. The guides that I used were very capable, knowledgeable and made us feel extremely safe.With a guide, you can see not only the famous tourist attractions around Rio (the Statue of Christ and Sugarloaf Mountain), but also the out of the way places like Santa Theresa, the Tijuca National Forest and the Parque da Cidade overlooking Rio from Niteroi. They also know the best restaurants to take you where you can get the most for your money! And most importantly, they know how to drive in this city where stop signs, lights etc. are just a suggestion!We had two guides for the week that we were there: Rafa Lopes Torres and Neyla Bontempo. Both of them were very affordable and gave us amazing tours.Go to Rio, hire a tour guide and have an incredible time!"
40,“Saaaaaaambaa!!!!”,"Rio is a place with enormous natural beauty, it is surrounded by mountains, loads of forests, beautiful beaches, very good restaurants and bars, free music in every corner, delicious fruit juices and coconut water everywhere and above all, the people are very welcoming and helpful. I have never had the feeling that it was “us and them” we usually experience when on holiday in some countries. Tourists and locals mingle together in harmony.There are also plenty museums, theatres, parks, exhibitions, parties and free music concerts everywhere.It's relatively cheap to eat. Beer is cheap and always very cold. You don’t get much hassle when walking on the streets or when on Ipanema beach, in my opinion a much better beach than the one in Copacabana.Rio is an experience no one forgets. My boyfriend and I go back to Rio every year since we’ve first been there in 2004."
50,“Don't Believe Negative Warnings About Rio”,"Rio is fantastic. Rio is safe. Rio is fun. Rio is a terrific vacation destination for couples, families, etc. I wanted to go to Rio for years, and I finally got my chance. My husband and I researched vacationing in Rio for months! I was really excited about going, but I read so many negative reviews about Rio. I read how dangerous it was, how poor, how dirty, etc. I became increasingly nervous. I was thrilled to go, but paranoid about the crime and danger. Thanks to everyone who scared the hell out of me (she said sarcastically)! After extensive planning, my husband and I flew down to Rio. We arrived at our hotel in Ipanema. I was upset because Delta lost our luggage, and I was without my clothes and makeup. We had come prepared. We wore no jewelry, we made copies of our passports and visas so we could leave the real ones in the hotel room safe. We wore our old cheap watches that we wouldn't mind losing in a mugging. By the time we checked in our room, I was so tired, upset, and paranoid, I didn't want to leave the room. We finally did, to buy toiletries and have lunch, but I was so on my guard, I was miserable. Everyone on the street was a potential criminal waiting to pull some scam or kidnap me. After lunch and a caprihina, I felt better. After a dip in the rooftop pool (I put my swimsuit in my carry on), I felt even better. After dinner and some chopp, I was ready to see Rio. But that day was waisted due to paranoia caused by prejudice and stories heard from ""a friend who heard from a friend that..."" We took a tour of Corcovado (which was very cloudy) and saw Cristo Redentor. He was a bit misty, but that's okay. We took the cable car to Sugar Loaf and saw spectacular views of Copacabana Beach. We spent a day at both Ipanema and Copacabana Beaches. We had a wonderful time. Rio is a typical tourist destination. We had sushi in Ipanema and walked back to our hotel at 1 a.m. We had no problems. Sure you can see the slums from the freeway, but just like any other big city, you don't vacation in the slums. I loved Rio. The people were friendly, the beaches were great. We drank agua de coco and had shrimp skewers sold by vendors walking by. The beach was full of families and couples enjoying the sun, surf, and sand. I read so many reviews where people warned against bringing your things to the beach since ""when you come back from the water, whatever you brought will be gone, stolen."" Duh!!! I had images of skinny favela kids lurking about, waiting for the opportunity to rob me blind. Or those same kids hassling me to buy ""chicle, chicle"" like at the Mexico border in Tiajuana. This was not the case at all. I grew up going to Newport Beach in Orange County, California, (a wealthy area) and I would NEVER leave my possessions on the beach while I was in the water. When we went to Ipanema Beach in the morning, we brought nothing but our towel and a couple Reals for drinks (per the advice of internet sites). My husband brought the waterproof camera hidden in the pocket of his trunks, but that was it. After, we took a taxi to Copacabana Beach, but I wanted to go bikini shopping before, so I brought my purse, and my husband brought his iphone. We sat on the beach, with all of our stuff, and had no problems. No one tried to steal our stuff. No one threw fluids on us to scam us into getting our shoes shined whilst robbng us. We just enjoyed the beach. Naturally, we didn't leave our stuff on the beach while we were in the water together, but we wouldn't do that anywhere. Who does that? I wish I would have had one more day in Rio since the first day was kind of a wash. We did get our luggage, but not until late the next day. Our tour began at 8 in the morning, so I had to wear an ugly outfit I bought at a store in Ipanema. If I had to plan the trip again, I would have stayed in Copacabana. I liked Ipanema for the restaurants, but Copacabana had better shopping. In Ipanema, they had either really high end stuff, or the equivalent of ""Forever 21."" In Copacabana, they have great shops that are reasonably priced. Try 33 Santa Clara Street for fabulous Brazilian bikinis that are about $35 US as opposed to $100 US in Ipanema. They also have some good shops for cheap souvenirs. The guy who was cleaning the beach (yes, there are guys who clean the beach sand something you never see on California beaches) gave me a card for his friend's shop. T-shirts, shot glasses, and magnets....Sold! That was about 2 streets north from Santa Clara. Another great aspect of Rio (and South America in general) is the fact that they sell Pepsi products. I've traveled to Europe several times and Japan, but they typically sell Coke Light. I am a member of the Pepsi generation, and I found it a wonderful surprise to buy a Pepsi Light at a kiosk on Copacabana Beach or in a restaurant in Ipanema. If you are considering a trip to Rio, definitely go. You will have a blast. It's gorgeous. We didn't go out to any clubs or bars, other than bars in the restaurants where we ate, so we didn't experience any of the nightlife, but we're 36 and 37 thus a little too old to go to a club. We did enjoy a very expensive dinner at the Copacabana Palace, the legendary hotel built in 1923. Swanky! Then we walked down the main street to look at all the street vendors' wares. Never did I feel unsafe in Rio. We never walked on the beach at night, but why would we? I have never had the need to walk on a beach at night. It's dark; what are you going to see?Rio is fabulous. Just use the same precautions you would use in London, Paris, Rome, Tokyo, New York City, or Los Angeles, and you will have a vacation to remember. Ignore all the negative, paranoid reviews and attitudes you hear from people who haven't been there, or people who have been living in a bubble and never visited a big city. Go to Rio and relax."
50,“Wonderfull City”,"Rio is simply wonderfull, since its mountais which meet the sea giving it a perfect shape to most famous and beautifull city in Brazil!From the Samba (inside the views and into the souls inrio) to the funk, you will have unbelievable experiences in rio, the place where you can come to rest, to see breathtaking views and the have the very most fun of all time!The food is great, the people are nice, the beaches are fantastic and the history is unique! Rio was capital until 1965 when it was changed to Brasilia but the charm is teh same. From the old to teh modern, Rio has everything that a big city must have and have more!If you want to have dream times, teh right place you should come is Rio de Janeiro!"
50,“Beautiful Rio”,"Rio is and wiil always be my destination. I live about 500 miles from, but as ever I can I fly to Rio de Janeiro, instead many people may think different. Rio is not only bikinis, carnaval and samba. Rio is museuns, beautiful churches, good restaurants (far from Copacabana beach), from morning to morning."
40,“Rio-extreme sensory overload”,"Rio is one of the few places that is exactly as advertized,if anything more so-more beautiful and more violent.I met a local woman who works for French TV,she told me every time she returns to Rio,it takes her 2 weeks to adjust to the extremes of color,noise,sex,violence.If the cliche about the 3rd world is a place of extremes,then Rio is the absolute extreme.People spend hours on the beach all year round,on a good Summer day Copacabana can have 800,000.The violence occurs at night in the streets,never on the beaches.All the beaches have video cameras,lifeguards,police,and local males who act as beachmasters.Rio merits a long visit,it is a long way to get there and it will take you at least 5 days to adjust to local rhythms.The language spoken in Rio is very different than Portuguese,it is musical,sexy,more like a contact sport involving a great deal of touching."
50,“Marvelous City”,"Before heading to Rio for our trip, we were a little bit cautious especially after all the negative reviews that we read about the city being dangerous to the tourists....however, we were proven wrong...not only the city was marvelous itself, but we felt safe all the time of our trip. There were lots of cops everywhere, and people were just really plain friendly. We never felt in danger in any time, in any case.Rio De Janeiro is such a lovely place to visit. Not only for its tremendous richness in places to visit, but Cariocas' food is simply delictable and interesting.We would definitely be back in Rio and definitely recommend anybody to give it a chance to visit this marvelous city in South America."
40,“Awesome Trip---right on the beach!”,"I can see why the Olympic committee was attracted to Rio. There is an aura about it that you rarely find in a city. We stayed at the JW Marriott right in Copa Cobana. It was in a tremendous location with every amenity required for a great trip. In addition to great beaches, we were impressed with the sites throughout Rio. The Christ the Redeemer statue is a must see. If you can, go when it is sunny...we had a few clouds during our visits. It's one of those sites that is even more impressive in person. I also highly recommend Sugar Loaf. If you are in shape, you can hire a guide and hike to the top. That's what we did, and it was worth every penny. Tip your guides well! Finally, the food everywhere was amazing. One thing to note, many entrees are priced for 2. We didn't figure that out until day 2 or 3....so, it's really pretty reasonable. Portions were generous everywhere...the meat was amazing. Also, treat yourself to an Acai smoothie! Public transportation left a little to be desired...I hope they figure out a solution by 2016! Either way, it was an awesome trip. The world is in for a treat!"
40,“We absolutely loved Rio !!!”,"My boyfriend and I just returned from Rio and we absolutely loved it!! The people (although most don't speak English) were incredibly nice! The food was terrific, the beach was beautiful, the weather was perfect and we loved the monkey's up on Sugar Loaf!! We are so happy the 2010 Olympics will be hosted by such a wonderful country!"
20,“The best area to stay in Rio de Janeiro”,"We stayed in Rio for a week in September 2009. We pre-booked a three bedroom apartment with ae-apartments 50 metres from the beach at Copacabana. While the apartment was okay, I would never recommend staying in the Copacabana area. It's noisy, grubby and pretty tacky on the whole. The beach is okay but not that great really.The much better location is Ipanema/Leblon, especially the border between these two districts. This area is a bit quieter (for sleeping) and has fantastic restaurants, cafes, clubs and shopping. The beach at Ipanema is much better than Copababana and safer for swimming. I wish he had stayed at Leblon particularly as the cafes and restaurants at Copacabana are on the whole very average, specialising in tourist food. If you like pizza Copacabana is the place but if you want variety and cafes within walking distance stay at Lebon or Ipanema."
50,“Rio de Janeiro a wonderful City”,"Just got back with family,wonderful city,happy people,superb food,and music, Go to the beach at Ipanema the water is clean there,great coconut water by kioks on the beach,Fun,colorful, great City,but not cheap.We felt safe,police presence,stay away from the Favelas and You'll be Ok,but be street smart.Over all a Marvelous trip of a life time. Angela. Abrigada Brasil"
50,“Awesome”,"We travelled to Rio for my partners 50th birthday as we thought it should be a special one - and it was !!Rio is a huge place steeped in history and has beautiful places to visit.We booked trips through Grey Line who were excellent. Pink Fleet cruise is a must , it takes you around the bay across to Nitteroi , views of Christ the Redeemer, Sugar Loaf ,and various other sights are brilliant. We also took the train up to Christ The Redeemer , views on the way up are spectacular as it is up at the top- even though I am scared of heights this is the 1 thing I HAD to see and I am glad I did .Just make sure you go up on a clear day.We also went on the cable car up Sugar Loaf , again the views from the top are outstanding.Saint Theresa is another area of beauty and there is a tram you can ride on.Some areas are not as safe as others but if you keep your wits about you and keep to the more public places it is as safe as London.We took a private tour and found it very beneficial as Fatima ( from Grey Line) knew where to go and showed us some sights we would never have found on our own. The Rain Forest is amazing and very serene.We had a wonderful meal at Siri Mole in Copacobana .All in all our holiday was amazing we will never forget it and hopefully will return to Rio one day ."
30,"“A popular, but poor choice”","Rio is a must see and certainly is one on the most beautiful locations in the world. It is also the worst place we visited in Brazil. It is big and expensive. It has lovely beaches. but limit your time there. The rest of Brazil is much better. Salvador Bahia, the Pantanal , Angra Dos Reis, Ouro Preto, etc. are much better."
20,“Visiting Rio--be careful”,"Pls don't get me wrong. I love this place and would go visit anytime. However, I would be very careful. Whether you are going to the beach, clubbing, dinner or anywhere, be careful of your belongings. Lots of people in Rio seem to survive by robbing tourists. People get robbed and either the hotel/apt gets broken into all the time. Unfortunately we lost a lot of items this time. Most people seem very friendly and come to find out that there is a reason behind it....to take your belongings. You have to be careful of the Taxi drivers..they are the biggest a@@@@. They try to charge you more expensive fare even during the day. I hate those taxi drivers.Just be careful visiting the city."
50,“Rio for Five Days”,"My wife and I were in Rio last week for her birthday. We found the city to be very beautiful, entertaining, fun and exciting. The sites are some of the most amazing you will ever see in the world. The people are friendly and accommodating to those that don’t speak the language. A little Portuguese helps (bring a translation book). The Portinari Design Hotel was a great place to stay if you like small boutique hotels.Our private tour guide Marcio Guedes (2 days) was very knowledgeable, accommodating, flexible and spoke great English. He really worked with us to customize our tour.We also went hanggliding, jeep tour of the jungle and a hike/rock climb up Sugarloaf.The climbing was difficult but very doable for any one that has done a little rock climbing. Very worth the effort to say you climbed up instead of taking the tram. The guides at Rio Hiking were great in every aspect. Gabby and Alex were very experienced climbers and very personable.Klaus at Rio Hanggliding took great care of my wife and made her feel safe and secure. She said it was the coolest thing she has ever done.All in all, we loved Rio."
50,“Best caipirinhas in Rio”,"I just returned from a week in Rio de Janeiro, where the weather was absolutely perfect: mild temperatures and practically no rain. The city was even more beautiful (and a lot safer) than I had imagined. I loved the food and Brazil’s national cocktail, the caipirinha. The restaurant I enjoyed the most was a small, cosy place one block from the beach in Copacabana called Espirito de Cosa, which has fabulous food at a reasonable price, and the best, THE VERY BEST, caipirinhas in Rio. It’s located at R. Domingos Ferreira, 2A, and should not be missed."
30,“A iconic city”,"Rio lives up to it's famous reputation for glitz and glamour, it also lives up to it's reputation for crime. The iconic sights of Sugarloaf and Christ statue can be seen from many spots in the city. The beaches, Ipanema and Copacobana lined with hotels and burger joints with a few nice cafes sprinkled in. This city can be dangerous as you have probably already heard. On this a second visit to Rio we experienced a negative aspect on this trip but we liked Rio and had a great time with most things we did and saw, would we go back? Probably, we are now better prepared for other adventures in our future. The view from Sugarloaf is outstanding and the botanical gardens is a GREAT place for bird watchers. It is part of the greatly diminished Atlantic rain forest. We also took an excursion to see the Golden Lion Tamarins (small primates) in the wild. They were critically endangered until a few years ago and are now 5,000 strong in small pockets. Very uplifting to see them and well worth the price tag."
50,“Great tour guide”,"We spent about one month in Rio de Janerio. I hadn`t taken that many photos as Rio can be a little dodgee. We decided to do a tour with a local and found this guy of Trip advisor ( Where else).He was just wonderful, he took us everywhere we wanted to go and more. We stopped at a truly local resturant and ate all the local food and beer. I got some of the best photos because I felt totally safe the whole time.I would recommend Emaneul Peclat Bernardes if you want a truely unforgetable experence. He was just great fun.Carioca way of lifemanu@nextel.br.blackberry.commanu.peclat@hotmail.comMobile phone: 55 21 78496674"
10,“Dangerous rio”,"It pains me to write this, because I love Rio and have often visited. But it is a very dangerous city, and you should not forget this. Tonight, i had a terrible, and I fear typical, experience. I was walking on Ipamena beach at 9 p.m. -- IPANEMA, the most ""tourist-friendly"" beach in Rio -- and was robbed by a group of knife-wielding teenagers at 9 p.m. There were plenty of people around as I was surrounded by these teenage thugs, who pushed me down and tried to grab everything out of pockets. I screamed ""help me,"" but no one came to my assistance. The gang got the I-Phone out of my pocket, although not my wallet (thank goodness). I tried to run and catch the gang, but again, despite my cries of ""stop them,"" no one helped me. It was very dis-spiriting, if only because the Cariocas nearby seemed to believe there was nothing to be gained -- and much to be risked -- by helping out this poor, dumb western tourist who had dared walk the most famous beach in Rio in the evening. I went the police station. And while the police officer was very nice, her only guidance was to stay in my hotel at night. Rio is too dangerous after dark, was her guidance. Very sad."
50,“Terrific tour in Rio”,"We have just returned from a 13-day South American cruise, with two days in Rio. We pre-arranged (from Toronto) a tour of Rio with Manu Peclat for four adults to see all the attractions. We were very excited to be in this beautiful city, and Manu was waiting for us when we disembarked our cruise ship. We spent the next 12 hours in his company and had an amazing time. He spoke perfect english which was refreshing, since we had language issues, even with the use of a phrase book. As we enjoyed the comfort of an air-conditioned van, Manu personalized and customized our day. He took us not only to the typical sites - Sugar Loaf Mountain and Christ the Redeemer but also to the lesser known sites where typically tourists would NOT go. The cable car ride in Santa Teresa was unique. The Carioca Aqueduct, a colonial structure that used to bring water to the centre of Rio, was converted into a bridge for The Santa Teresa Historic Tramway (bondinho). The old tram is the only one in Rio - and starts in the city centre, near the Largo da Carioca square, crosses the old aqueduct and goes through the picturesque streets of the neighbourhood with wonderful views of the city looking downhill. While in this area we were taken to the Mineiro Bar where we enjoyed Atlantica Maltzbiere and Paschtal - little turnover pastries filled with either black bean, cheese/mushroom or shrimp. Totally yummy! Another terrific stop was at the beautiful olde worlde Confeitaria Colombo. As we walked into The Colombo Coffee House, (built in 1884) we felt as if we'd gone back in time - it was exquisite. The decor, service and charm were wonderful. We had coffee and light pastries which were absolutely delicious. We were very glad to have made the stop and it was well worth the visit - especially if you're a caffeineaholic! Manu then took us to see Sugar Loaf - at night. What a spectacular view and unique experience.At the end of the day we were tired, but completely satisfied we had seen everything we had planned to. In fact we had such a good time, we asked him to meet us again the next day to go back to Ipanema Beach, Copacabana Beach and of course for some souvenir shopping! We highly recommend Manu as a guide - we felt totally safe and comfortable with him at all times - he was very friendly and reliable and even took some great pictures!"
50,“Don't let the stories scare you off”,"Well having got back from 2 weeks in Rio last week now is the time for the usual report.Flights with Heathrow to GIG with B.A. No problems at Terminal 5. 11hr flight. GIG airport is a bit basic to say the least. ATM’s located on top floor but I nearly had a heart attack when my card kept getting rejected. I must have tried about 8 different machines. This is a recurring theme I had throughout the holiday. You have to look for ATM’s with Cirrus symbols on them (if you are using VISA). The majority of ATM’s do not have this. Look for Citibank and Banco Do Brasil (not all machines).I was determined to just hail a normal cab from outside the airport (personally I found most taxis to be trustworthy (apart from the odd one who tries to go round the houses or put you on tarifa 2 instead of 1..but the difference works out to be minimal) and the radio cabs in my opinion are uneccesary from the airport) but as figures I had researched had varied somewhat I wasn’t sure what I should be haggling towards. In the end I was approached by a driver who sweet talked me (I was tired and he started talking about David Beckham) and we agreed a figure of 65R$ to Ipanema. I found out that this is about 10/15R too high. Anyway got to the hotel in one piece.Hotel Sol Ipanema is a nice enough hotel right on the beach with roof top dip pool but costs about 360R$ + tax a night. This is stupidly expensive for what you get. This is not a criticism of this particular hotel but Rio in general which is the most expensive latin-american country I have visited thus far.Ipanema itself is a great base whilst in Rio and was safe enough to walk about until about 10pm (maybe even after this time but we were getting taxis). Plenty of people strolling about with mobiles and Ipods so you shouldn’t feel paranoid about whipping your camera out discreetly. Lets say the people living here have a few Reals to rub together.Ipanema beach is lovely and clean but the waves are strong. Be aware of red warning signs by the Postos when currents are strong.As my friend was on business we ended up getting taxis to most places which are quite reasonable. Centro is quite cool and is really bustling midweek. Ate at a place call Sabor on a pedestrian walkway near the dock and down from the Candelaria church. Even if the weather is not so good (which is surprisingly often) a stroll about is quite interesting.Nightime in Rio is quite cool as well. First big night we had was in Leblon. Started at Academia de Cahaca (nice hustle and bustle and you feel like one of the locals) and then walked down to the seafront and had Chopes in all the little bottequins on the way. Interesting to compare pubs in the U.K. to brazilian bottequins. They feel so much more full of life in Rio and all the families and friends are out together chatting away. In the balmy air there is a really nice ambience. Ended up in Melt. Quite pricey. Pumping House music and a young well heeled crowd. Be aware that you get given a card with you entrance fee and consumption marked as you go. God knows what happens if you go a bit crazy and drink more then you can afford. Maybe they just drive you up to Rocinha and drop you off dressed up as a military policeman Second big night was in Lapa. It sure is a crazy place and the complete opposite of Leblon. It certainly feels a lot grimier (but not in a bad way) loads of stalls selling drinks and food and people milling about. Saw some amazing live samba under the arches. Certainly a lot of strung out characters but we had our eyes open so no problems. Ended up in Cine 50 (I think that is the name) off the main drag that is the site of a former cinema converted into a club (they still had the original chairs around the edges). They played a mix of Beatles and Tropicalia. Awesome, good value night and we were the only gringos in there.In terms of the big sights Sugarloaf and Christ the Redeemer or no brainers. All I would say is that you really need to go on a clear early morning to see Cristo as it almost always clouds over at the summit (thus making it a waste of time). Even going early I was a bit disappointed with the view as it was quite hazy. Believe it or not the first time we went there we were massively hung over. We saw the huge queue and thought it would be best to go back to bed. My friend never did get round to going up!!! Sugarloaf is best at sundown and is pretty in its own way..again weather is everything.Football wise I managed to catch 2 games. One of those was Flamengo v Botafogo 1-0 (cr*p game, no atmosphere, stadium half empty). The other was a top of table clash against Palmeiras (awesome game, stadium virtually full). First time we were a bit worried and got a cab straight there 25R$. Some characters milling about but got our zona blanco neutral tickets (where the neutrals family go, not all the booths sell those tickets and I didn’t think it was that clearly marked) for 50R$ each. The ticket booths are funny. You have to get down on your knees and the slot is just big enough to put your hand in. This must stop the dubious characters from holdng up the attendants. Compared to the likes of Wembley or Emirates the Maracana is nothing to write home about but it is the atmosphere that makes it. Don’t expect them all to be great though. Most of the decent brazilian play in Europe. You can get there by metro as well. Station right next to the ground and fairly painless and safe enough. Oh and if you are after a football that isn’t Flamengo. You can forget it. Go to the night market at Copacabana for that.Regarding safety in general I felt safe walking around during the day in Centro, Botafogo, Flamengo, Leblon, Ipanema and Barra (described as the Miami of Brazil in LP, that is the biggest joke I’ve ever heard, apart from big shopping malls the place is a bit of a dirty hard to navigate hole). I pretty much avoided Copcabana after dark after hearing all the stories but it didn’t look too bad to be honest My initial paranoia mellowed to a relaxed state after a couple of days. It always pays to keep your eyes open and valuables in the hotel room though.Spent 4 days down the coast in Parati which is a nice break from the hustle and bustle of Rio and a good base to check the fantastic countryside and beaches. Got a bus with Costa Verde from Rodoviaria. Took about 4.5hrs. Pretty scenic ride. Parati is a unique town of cobblestone streets and colonial buildings. There are more pousadas then you can shake a stick at so plenty of options. After an initial night at one we didn’t like (can’t remember the name) we opted for the Porto Imperial which was a bit upmarket to be honest (not my choice). Was about 300R$ a night. It was a good decision as the place is fantastic. Great bar/breakfast area, beautiful pool. Games room. Felt a bit like a colonial hacienda.Had more trouble getting money out. All ATM’s rejected our cards until we found the Banco Do Brasil ATM with Cirrus sign (there is only one in the branch) Phew!Beware some high entrance fees. Ended up paying 40R$ for 2 caipirinhas at Paraty 33 once entrance fee was included. Nothing advising there was an entrance fee when we went in. Some O.k bars in the middle square but it was a little dead when we went there. Off season and during the weak. I’m sure it is a little better at the weekend. Ate a few nights at Sabor Da Terra, great por kilo restaurant just outside the centre. Tasty and good value. Just down the road there was a little self-service free ice cream place with loads of different flavours/toppings which was always empty but recommendable.We had a bit of bad luck with the weather as it was mostly overcast during the time there but nevertheless we hopped on a local bus to Penha and went to Cachoiera Toboga natural waterfalls. Truly a unique experience. In the jungle nature had carved a natural waterslide. A river flows over a huge rock face that is slippery with algae and has turned into a waterslide. Some of the locals were even doing some type of “rock surfing” sliding down to the pool at the bottom on their feet. It has to be seen to be believed.Next day other local bus took us to Trindade a fantastic collection of beaches that culminate in the Praia Caudaxo a naturally formed swimming pool in the ocean that is formed by massive boulders which are a feature of this area. A emerald green pool back by lush hilled rain-forest. On a sunny day it is beautiful. I think we went back to Rock n Beach where the bars belt out Bob Marley whilst you can enjoy the beverage of your choice as you watch the surfers. A wonderful place.We also took a schooner tour. This only cost 20R$. You pay extra for equipment and food, drinks. We were taken on a lovely boat to a few coves. Shame it wasn’t a sunny day as I could imagine it would have been that much better. You can dive off the boat and check out the jungle backed beaches which were pretty cool. Snorkeling was a bit lame really…a few fish and visibility wasn’t so hot but it might have been better on a sunny day. Certainly worth a trip out to see the islands anyway but pick a sunny day if you have achoice (you might not as they don’t call it the Costa Verde for nothing).Misc: With Spanish you can kind of get by ordering things and getting from A to B but you will struggle with in depth conversations. English is not widely spoken so gringos may have to resort to hand signals.We were stopped twice by police in Ipanema whilst in taxis. Once was quite early 10pm one was late 4am. Both times we were searched and my heart sank. I thought we would be asked for a cervejina or worse have one of the guys pop a little cocaine in our pockets. The thought of few nights in a Brazilian jail was not on my pre-trip itinerary. Both times I think they were looking to bust us for drugs. Seriously do not even think about it. In Lapa no doubt you could get hold of us stuff but the risks are huge. I had a guy next to me in the urinal snort a load of the back of his hand as if he were swigging a cerveja.Did not see a lot of prostitution but we didn’t visit Help,Scenarium or Lord Jim’s(the type of nightspots that attract a higher then normal percentage of gringos).Did a Favela Tour with Favela Tours. Not dodgy at all and surprisingly informative. Our guide gave us lots of info about the political and economic state of Brazil and the history of the favela. I was a bit worried that it might be a bit of a zoo experience, it turned out to be fine. The locals of Rocinha didn’t really pay us much thought as they have no doubt have had the same chaperoned set of gringos with cameras amble through their patch twice a day for decades. We could only walk about short distances in designated areas so the risks must be pretty high for those who were to wander round alone. We then went to Vila Canoas a smaller favela not run by the drug gangs which has a small town vibe and where part of the proceeds of the tour were helping fund a local drop in centre of young kids whose school day doesn’t run 9 to 5. I genuinely (or was cleverly convinced for the cynics among you) that the whole thing was a positive experience for both sides. I think I am savvy enough to know when I am being fed BS or not. Whilst not being the epiphany I have heard it being described as it certainly is a recommend excursion. 65R$ (call them direct or you will pay higher through a hotel).Anyways that’s tapping from me. Rio (and it surroundings) are a great place to visit. Pack lots of money and your common sense and you will have a great time."
40,“Safety in Rio de Janeiro”,"Hi to all fellow travellersI have just left Rio 29th Oct '08.Before I left Ireland I had read alot of threads regarding safety in Rio and to tell you the truth was a bit scared about going there.So now back safe and sound again, I will give you my opinion.I didnt wear any jewellery only had a cheap watch. I had a plain black handbag which wore across the body which held my small camcorder and only brought out enough money for the day. Some days put handbag inside another bag.Just made eye contact with people and kept eye on people if they started to walk after us when we passed.Dont walk along beach after dark or dim lit areasSo just be street smart and have a great time in RioChao"
50,“An American's visit to Rio”,"I thought the locals were basically friendly and helpful, especially if you try to learn a few helpful phrases in Brazilian Portugese. The food was good, but following my doctor's advice, I chewed two Pepto Bismol tablets BEFORE each meal and avoided tap water and ice. If you take an ATM debit card from a US bank, HSBC and Citibank might be two of very few banks whose ATM's will accept your debit card. Many will tell you to avoid wearing jewelry and watches, and to keep your camera hidden are generally good ideas in Rio. Corcavado, Sugar Loaf and Ipanema are all OK during the daytime. Ask your desk clerk about other locations or nighttime destinations in the city."
40,“Brazil may not be what you expect..”,"Brazil is definately not what I had expected. It's much dirtier, a lot of places smelled like pee. Lots of beauty but a lot of garbage too. Literally, mountains of garbage in places. MOUNTAINS. We stayed at Le Meriden on Copa beach and the hotel was very nice however I prefer Ipanema beach after visiting the area. There really isn't any relaxing on Copacabana since you are constantly being hounded to buy anything from shrimp, to bikinis and sunglasses, someone was constantly trying to get me to buy something. Of course you will have this at Ipanema but not nearly as constant as Copa. Both beaches are beautiful in the evening but don't stay out past then. No one had told me or my husband that and when we stayed on Copa beach until dark 2 guys tried to take my purse. My husband was larger than both men so we didn't have any major problems thankfully. If you do go to Brazil make sure you see Iguazu Falls near border of Argentina. It's just a short flight from Rio."
50,“Hotel Praia Ipanema versus Sol Ipanema”,"We just returned from Rio and had an incredible time! Due to flight problems and changing of plans, we arrived two days early. Our booked hotel, the Sol Ipanema, said they were sold out and could not take us in. They recommended the Praia Ipanema. This turned out to be an excellent choice!The Praia Ipanema is located right on Ipanema Beach. Our room had a side balcony with views of the beach and of Christ the Redeemer. It looked like all of the rooms probably had a side balcony, no front views. The Sol Ipanema did not appear to have any balconies.Maid service, doormen, the service at the front desk, and the business center were excellent! Internet access (if you brought a laptop) was $.17US a minute, $.25 a minute if you used their computers. The buffet which was included in our room charge was very good and included hot and cold items.We went down to the Sol Ipanema to see if we would want to move there when our reservation would have begun and we are so glad that we had the Praia Ipanema! The Sol Ipanema is undergoing major reconstruction so that is why they were ""booked."" It looked like most (if not all) of the rooms on the upper floors were being remodeled. The lobby did not look as inviting and the buffet did not look as delicious as the Praia Ipanema. It is located on a busier stretch of Ipanema which may be a plus for some, however.At the beach, the Praia Ipanema has a stand where chairs and umbrellas were handed out free of charge to guests. Prior to leaving for the beach, guests pick up beach towels on a lower level. The pool is very small and is located on the roof. There is a bar and restaurant on the roof, too. The hotel also has a small exercise room with ellipticals, weights, and a treadmill.We ended up negotiating a rate of $178US for a triple room which beat the Sol Ipanema by almost $100!"
50,“Carnaval in Rio”,"This past February, my wife and I had the pleasure of attending Rio's world famous pre-lenten celebration; the parade of the 'Escolas de Samba', or Samba Schools. On two consecutive nights, from 9:00 p.m. until early morning, the twelve selected schools (six each night) parade along the 700 meter long by 30 meter wide Sambadromo to the wildly cheering, often boisterous crowd of thousands lining both sides of the venue. Each school, consisting of 4000 to 5000 colorfully costumed dancers, divided into groups of 350 to 400 with each group having a distinct costume style, is allotted ninety minutes to complete the route and pass before the reviewing judges. Additionally, each group of dancers is separated by large and elaborately decorated floats, as few as eight or as many as twelve, pushed forward by a score of muscular young men. The compact, compressed venue maximizes the impact of the music - lively sambas created annually by each school to emphasize the dancers and the school's chosen theme. Beautiful, scantily clad female dancers, sporting exotic headdresses lead each group. (I could have sworn that one of the shapely ladies wore only her headress and platform shoes.)It was one of the most amazing spectacles we've ever had the pleasure of attending during our many years of travel, and well worth the attendant exhaustion.Rio, with its beautiful beaches, amazing geography, wonderful food, and easygoing lifestyle, has replaced Venice, Italy as our favorite city."
50,“Marvelous City”,"Cariocas, as natives of Rio call themselves, refer to their hometown as ""The Marvelous City,"" and this is no exaggeration. In the beach, it might be compared to Miami, Honolulu, Monte Carlo or Acapulco, but Rio is better. A week there was not enough.My only complaint is about the airport, although the true disaster in this respect, was Sao Paulo, where we had to change planes. It was all chaos and confusion, endless queues leading into other endless queues. But I would endure it all again. Rio is worth it."
50,"“Don't miss it, the gateway to South America”","Oceania Cruises has an incredible 12 days cruises that starts in Rio and ends in Buenos Aires. I took it last December along with a traveling group of three others: my boyfriend, his daughter and his sister. We LOVED it! Simply put, Rio is an extraordinary city that frankly, we spent too little time in. So many people warned us about the crime there, the favellas, etc, that in the interest of safety, we only spent a day and a half there - at the beginning of our cruise. Big mistake. Rio is so beautiful and you can't really appreciate it from the photos that you have seen. It is surrounded by the ocean on three sides with inlets everywhere, and mountains everywhere. It took a trip up Sugar Loaf Mountain and then to see Christo to really understand the luxurious terrain. The beaches are also something unique. They are long and deep. And, as someone said, beaches in Rio are like cafes in Paris. It's where everyone goes - to refresh, to do business, to meet friends, etc. The different beaches are identified by the numbers on the lifeguard stands and different social groups tend to gather accordingly. Of course Carnival and New Year's Eve are well-known celebrations in Rio but, if you ask me, any day is the right day to visit."
50,“2nd favorite place in the WORLD”,"You here a lot of comments from people that hear other people mention that Rio is not safe and should be avoided.That would be the biggest mistake of your life! It is a beautiful place that is actually feels safer than London to walk around, we took normal city precautions of no jewellery on show, camera and wallet kept in the front pockets etc. We felt safe everywhere we went and enjoyed a city thats packed with lots of well known attractions.We visited Christ the redeemer, Sugar loaf mountain, Samba street, Cococabana beach, Ipanema beach and a church that looked like a concrete pyramid from the outside but 4 beautiful stain glass windows from the insie. Oh and many many many shops.The resturants we visited, (no idea what they were called) served food as if it was going out of fashion and if you are a fellow carnivor then this is the place for you, the amount of meat on offer is fantastic."
50,“copacabana is the best place in the world”,"T o anybody who is thinking about travelling to rio de janeiro, just do it, you will remeber this place for the rest of your life. The beaches are amazing, so is the bustling city centre. The people are extremely welcoming and friendly, everybody is always smiling. For me the best part about being there was the bus rides, yeah i know it sounds boring, but they drive down the streets at amazing speed and its like a off road adventure everytime, i loved them. The shopping centres are vast and very cheap, and the nightlife has something to cater for every taste. I plan on going back very soon, to stay with my friend again, just a shame that i cant stay there, believe me, when you go, you wont want to leave the most amazing city on this planet........."
50,“I love Rio”,"Rio was amazing! Just stay safe buy trying to blend in, and leaving your jewelry at home. As long as you don't walk around with anything flashy you will be fine. Locals dont wear anything flashy so that makes you stand out. Be smart and you will have the best experience."
50,“Experience Rio Before You Die!”,"I have been fortunate in my job to visit some of the most remarkable places in the world....but nothing tops Rio de Janeiro!!! Rio is more than a beautiful city...it is an attitude of joy of life, relaxation of soul, unbridled energy and spirit, and a genuine friendliness of the residents for visitors unequaled anywhere in the world. During my visits, I like to stay in the smaller hotels in Copacabana and Ipanema. My favorite hotel facing the beach is the Excelsior in Copacabana---staff is wonderful, location is convenient to everything, and breakfast is a feast. Call me a romantic, but I never tire of walking the beach sidewalks of Copacabana or Ipanema...stopping at a sidewalk cafe for a cold beer and lots of people watching. Yes, I have been up the Sugarloaf (Pao de Acucar) and Christ Statue (Corcovado ) many times and never feel disappointed by the stunning views....and fellow travelers that you meet at these locations. Don't forget to have lunch in funky and artsy Santa Teresa--a hillside neighborhood served by an old bonde or streetcar. As the sun sets over the ocean, find a good sidewalk cafe and have a caipirinha or two (sugar cane rum cocktail)---verrrry relaxing drink! :) So many good restaurants in Rio--try a traditional churracaria (Marius in Leme, perhaps) or enjoy the great food and 'street scene' at Mio Restuarante in Ipanema. Don't forget the night market facing the beach in Copacabana--lots of handicrafts or if you are in Rio on a Sunday, you should not miss the Hippie Fair which has more upscale crafts and arts of all types. Okay, you Rio residents, called Cariocas, will want to kill me, but if this is your first time in Brazil, go to the Plataforma Club one evening to see a traditional dancing and music show---yes, touristy, kitchy, and over the top....but oh, so much fun! Yes, you can get up on stage and sing and dance with the performers---a few caipirinhas and you can host the show!! :) For a more local club, go to some of the sidestreets of 'downtown Rio' ---center city and the business district but with a warehouse/colonial section housing great music and dance primarily composed of mostly locals. There are also lots of adventure sports in Rio including parasailing off one of the mountainsides and landing on a beach. Rio also has the largest rainforest (Tijuca) of any city in the world and the plants and flowers there are worth the visit. Enjoy your visit to Rio and be prepared to come back soon!"
50,“Rio City of Lights”,"Rio de Janeiro was the first stop in a very spontaneous, amazing trip that I took last year. I landed in Rio and couldn't stay away from it. During a 2-month stay in Brasil, I traveled to Rio 4 times. Copacabana has a wonderful beach life, a great market (but some would like the market in Ipanema better), and the overall atmosphere is of sheer freedom. People there are so welcoming and friendly, and it's always fun to dress down, blend in the crowd and absorb the ambiance. If you wanna get down and party, the district for that is definitely Lapa - where endless bars and clubs are spread out for you each night, you just have to take your pick. I recommend Rio with all my heart. As long as you got there, stay there, for at least 2 weeks until you feel like you're ready to move on.The view from the Corcovado is incredible during the daytime, and if you're up for a wonderful sunset, go to the other end of the city and up mount Pao do Acucar, where you can watch the sun go down on the Jesus Christ Statue."
10,“stay away from copacabana”,"I traveled to Rio in May this year with a friend. Many people told us that it was dangerous (2 girls). We have both traveled before and said, we know what to look out for, we will be fine.The first day we arrived we set out to walk from copacabana to impanema along Atlantica (the major street that runs along the beach). We set out at 11:30 a.m., there were not too many people out as it was a week day but a few people standing at hotel doors or at restaurants.As we were walking 3 boys (around 13), were looking at us and then got up and started walking around us. I was staring them down - letting them know I see you and am very aware of you. All of a sudden they grab my bag and pinch my friend's arm. I start screaming as I play tug of war with the kid. I scream louder as I keep pulling my bag back and then he lets go and all 3 keep walking, walking! down the street. My friend and I look around and realize no one on the street has even flinched. Are you kidding me? We were screaming bloody murder and no one cares!We walked over the the closest hotel/restaurant and asked the men there to call the police, they said the police would not do anything and would not call (keep in mind we can still see the kids walking at this time).Lucky for us they did not get anything, but after that we did not feel safe in Rio - realizing that if anything happened no one would help us.Rio is an amazing place, it is just so sad that the people there don't care and are fine with watching kids take advantage of foreigners. Unfortunately Brazil still has a lot of work to do."
50,"“My best trip ever was to Rio, I'll always treasure it. worth the money”","I loved Rio & the people were friendly, helpful, & the weather was great. I don't have any negative remarks about Rio. I'd like to return there someday."
50,“Some faves from my trip to Rio”,"Although this was my second time in Brazil, it was the first visit where I spent any considerable time in the city of Rio. It was beyond my expectations and I had a fantastic CRIME-FREE trip. For those of you planning a trip to Rio, here are a couple of suggestions beyond the normal Giant-Jesus-Beach-Bunny reviews:1) Hotel Vermont , Rua Visconde de Pirajá, 254 IpanemaA no-frills hotel in a fantastic location. Wonderful breakfast with a superb, responsive staff.2) Letras & Expressao, Rua Visconde de Pirajá, 276 IpanemaJust down the street from the Vermont, it carries a good selection of guide books. It also has a cafe upstairs with cheap internet access.3) Bijou Box, Rua Farme de Amoedo, 35 IpanemaCute accessories shop with high-end but reasonably priced costume jewelry. Neat silk scarves!4) Mahogany, Rua Vinicius de Maraes, 74 IpanemaGreat selection of soaps and lotions. Perfect for souvenirs.5) La Botella, Rua Paul Redfern, 72 IpanemaWine shop cum bistro. Delicious salads and sandwiches. Wines by the glass.6) Nik Shushi, Rua Garcia Davila, 83 IpanemaPopular all-you-can-eat sushi joint, where everything is made to order. Get there early or make a reservation!"
50,“Great views from Corcovado and sugar loaf”,"Don't be put off by the negative press about Rio,I must admit I was scared senseless by some of the advice and stories I'd heard,our pick up from the airport also warned us to be very careful,but I think they do this to emphasise the need for you to be careful and sensible,we didn't wear any jewelry at all i.e. rings ,watches,necklaces etc and If we took a photo we immediately put our camera into our bag which we kept close to us,all in all take slightly more precautions than you would in any major city in the world.Do not go wandering around the back streets at night ,take a cab from hotel to venue and back,we did this many times and had no bad experiences.The other parts of Brazil we visited,Iguaccu and salvadore (we stayed at Praia de forte) we found safer than our own country !!!!"
10,“What a dump”,"After backpacking around south america for 3 months thought i would treat myself to two weeks of luxury in rio at the end of my trip. What a mistake. Firstly the weather was awful which i know can´t be helped but i really highlights what an awful dump this city really is. There is nothing to do, the place is dirty, seedy, has a million shops but all full of dimestore clothes. Nothing original about this place at all. The beach where i did manage to spend a few days out of the two weeks is not a peaceful place at all. You are constantly bothered by people selling icecream, sandwiches, melons, beach towels, bags, jewellery etc etc etc. It doesn´t matter if you are reading, listending to music or asleep they will come and interrupt you. You can say no thanks but sometimes that desn´t help and they start pleading with you. Its just a form of legalised begging. One guy wouldn´t leave me alone for ten minutes until i eventually ignored him then he was very abusive to me as he left.Food tends to be stodgy and unhealthy, people are rude and unhelpful (they expect you to speak portuguese and even when you tell them you can´t they just carry on shouting at you in portuguese). Don´t be fooled into thinking spanish will get you by, it won´t, people seem to resent having to speak Spanish to communicate with the rest of the world.I have never been to such a god awful place and i hope this review helps people to change there minds about coming here its a waste of time and money and i am counting the days til i get back home."
50,“Tour Guides Make it better”,"March 22, 2007We just returned from 10 days in Rio during Carnival. What a great experience! There is so much to see and the weather has a great deal in determining when is the best time to see the sites. As an example the see the statue of Christ you want to get there when it is not covered in clouds and before 2 PM so you can have the sun in the right place while you take pictures. Besides all of the famous places there are so many small out of the way places to see. Each traveler has certain interests such as shopping (my wife) or military history (me) you want to work with someone who not only know the city but knows what you want to see. Pick a good guide, we had a great one in Marcio Guedes. Have all your prices arranged ahead of time and make sure you know if you are paying by the day or by the person.Rick De BurghGranada Hills CA"
10,“Debit card fraud”,"I just got back from a 3 week trip to South America ending in Rio de Janeiro for 3 days. I normally only use my debit card at ATM's to get cash but this trip is used it to charge some meals. I have been back in the states for a week now and recieved a call from my bank that they suspected some fraudulent charges on my debit card. Sure enough, there was over $500 charged yesterday in Rio and it wasn't me. Watch out! I suggest you use cash only in Rio!"
40,“Pleasantly Surprised”,"Where do I start.... OK,I caught a lot of flak from family and friends for choosing to go to Rio alone. I am single and female and just wanted to go somewhere other than the usual ""club meds"". I can't say how happy I am that I decided to go against every ones wishes.Safety.......I never felt threatened once while I was there and I spent a week there by myself. My hotel was in Copacabana, a block a way from the beach. I walked back and forth to Ipanema every day. As I got more comfortable, I even did the walk in the dark. I promised myself that if I ever felt ""unsafe"" that I would jump in a cab (which are all over) and forgo the walk and I I never had to do that. There are homeless people.....men and children, all over, but they really don't bother you. I come from NY, so seeing that doesn't bother me at all and I learned to avoid them. I'm not saying that you should go around flashing all of the money you have, you need to use your head and common sense. I went to the bank (hsbc) only in the day time. I didn't carry all of my money and I didn't carry a purse. I basically wore cargo pants and put whatever I had in the pockets and buttoned them. They dress pretty casually there, and are in flip flops all of the time. When in Rio do with the Brazilians do!!!!!Beach.......I stayed on the beach close to my hotel which meant that I stayed in Copa for the most part. I found the locals to be very friendly and they really tried to help. If you ask someone to watch your bag while you take a dip, they are more than happy to do it. I did notice on some days that the ""children"" were out in full force. They are the ones to look out for. They come around begging and trying to rob you. The locals do not want to get robbed either, so anything they can do to help, they will. I didn't realize it, but there is a lot of prostitution on the beach too. That didn't bother me......gave me more things to be amused by. They also sell everything you can possibly want on the beach....all brought to you, without ever having to get up. Beer, water, sandwiches, suntan oil, ice cream, ices, bathing suits, sarongs...and the list goes on and on. All very cheap too. They rent beach chairs and umbrellas, and if you haggle with them, they do lower their prices. If you are staying for a week or longer, I would suggest that you go to one of the local stores and buy a chair or an umbrella for about 10 USD.I had heard about the Hippie Fair in Ipanema before I went, and if you are going to be in Rio on a Sunday, you should make a trip there too. There is a fair every night in Copa along the beach which is smaller but if you need little trinkets, it serves its purpose without having to go to Ipanema.. Walking along the beach is very safe. There are bars about every 200 feet and they are full of people day and night, especially on the weekends. If you are an exercise buff, you will not be out of place by walking the length of the beach at any time of the day or night.All in all, I would say that being in Rio was a positive experience. I'm sure that the things that you've heard or read about do happen. In a city with millions of people and plenty of poverty, it is probably a given....just don't let it happen to you."
50,“Rio is huge”,"Can't say enough about Rio- weather, food and people- watch your wallet and have an incredible time"
50,“Beautiful City”,"We spent 4 wonderful days in beautiful Rio. I did not expect to find such a clean city (obviously ignoring the favelas), but it is. The people are wonderful and so is the food. I highly recommend the Cipriani restaurant at the Copacabana Palace (check my review of that hotel) . The menu is very innovative and absolutely delicious; service is impeccable.Although you must see the usual attractions, Corcovado, Sugar Loaf, the rain forest, etc., don't miss going to Petropolis - the imperial city where the last emperor of Portugal/Brazil lived. Although it takes about 90 minutes to get to Petropolis, it is worth the time. We decided to hire a car with driver recommended by the Copacabana Palace staff - we paid $150.00 for the complete day. Roberto Gusmao was an excellent driver and took us to all the sites of interest in Petropolis.Another day we hired another private car and driver also recommended by the Copacabana Palace staff to drive around Rio, including going to the rainforest , which is not usually offered as a tour, and the San Conrado Fashion Mall."
50,“i want to emigrate to rio”,"Firstly i am glad i bumped on to your site. the imformation that i extracted was really helpful. Imformation about hotels restaurants taxis,tourist attractions and night life.Are all Brazilians as friendly as i found them or is it me who wanted to get on?Thank you for the imformation on nightclubs.One point to make is that all nightclubs require you to bring your id before you can enter the club, that was something new to me.Nutch was an excellent recomendation,Help is ok if you are looking for something extra,not my cup of tea.Barronett was mainly for youngsters,expensive,but i had good fun good music friendly youngsters loved to dance there.Taxi drivers i think they live in a world of their own,charge what you can get away with, sorry not me. I suppose taxi drivers live on a planet of their own all over the world.All restaurants i visited were good value for money. Weigh for what you eat was a new experience.My hotel was not bad at all, although the staff at the reception could have been abit more friendly,just a smile is not very taxing.I am hoping to ro back when the carnival is on.Love Brazil and the Brazilians."
50,“Sunsets”,"We are running autunn time, so the sun position of course changes, and you have heard that the best places to see the sunset are on the Sugar Loaf Mountain or in the famous rock of Arpoador close to Ipanema....Absulutely wrong...Find a place called Niteroi and go to São Francisco Area, and you will agree to what I say!Niteroi is easy to reach but you have to know the city quite well to know the right spots, but if you cross a bridge which links Rio and Niteroi and follow the signs you will be there, the bridge is called PONTE RIO-NITEROI.If you find the right spot, please keep the secret, otherwise they will charge you a ticket, for the moment going there is absolutely free, hehehe :)))"
50,“Blame it on RIO”,"As a seasoned traveler and having enjoyed this Marvelous City over 50 times during the past 18 years I just can't seem to get enough. I would have to say there is not another vacation spot that can compare, the people here are fantastic, though you do need to be careful of some areas and not to heed words of caution can ruin your trip. The beach is usually best for a tourist to align themselves with one of the Barraca's ( a tent where they sell refreshments & rent chairs & umbrellas). They'll keep a running tab for you and an eye on your things while you enjoy the ocean. Graet deals are a bus ride away in the central area of the city where there are many shops in a bazar type atmosphere, leather goods, guitars, craft supplies, shoes or almost anything you could want. It can be reasonably inexpensive to eat as there are many churrasco's ( bar B que all you can eat) or a por kilo restuarant where 2 can have lunch or dinner for less than 10 bucks american and the food is a good! A great side trip from Rio is a 2 hour flight to Foz do Iguacu, the waterfalls where a 5 day pakage can be taken for approximately $1000. US dollars with a 4 star hotel an a competent guide for seeing the the waterfalls and the huge dam that supplies a hugh amount of power to Brazil. Brazil can be all you need in a vacation you just need to know how to find what you like. If you need a guide it would be my pleasure to help you out."
50,“Impressionante”,"Eu adorei conhecer e ficar hospedada em Copacabana. Me sentia em uma novela do Manoel Carlos. Em uma das viagens fui no período de carnaval e era o máximo a muvuca e a quantidade de pessoas que circulavam por lá. Da outra vez eu fui com minhas filhas e curti de uma maneira completamente diferente. Visitamos feirinha e fizemos compras. Fomos ao supermercado. Caminhamos ao redor do hotel até mesmo a noite. Não me senti insegura em nenhum momento. E fiquei encantada com a cidade, a praia, o encato que tudo por lá proporciona."
50,“I LOVE RIO”,"Si viajas a Río de Janeiro, tienes que visitar Pan de Azucar, Corcovado,Petropolis, Angra Dos Reis , Buzios. Y obvamiento sus playas : Copacabana, Ipanema, Leblon...Brasil es uno de mis países favoritos para vacacionar. Me encanta!!!!!!!"
50,“Красиво)”,"Не ленитесь погулять по центру города!Есть что посмотреть,тем более , что в Рио не очень много таких мест. Лучше взять бесплатную экскурсию ))"
50,“Que experiencia tan Única 100% Recomendable.”,"Hola, amigos soy de Venezuela. Tuve la magnifica oportunidad de visitar esa hermosa ciudad como lo es Río de Janeiro, quede sorprendida de la amabilidad de sus habitantes, su cultura, su historia y escuchar lo orgullosos que están de vivir en sus alrededores. Me llamo mucho la atención sus favelas o comunidades como muchos de ellos le dicen ya que desde el avión se puede apreciar lo organizados, lo aseados que son no solo para mostrarle al turista sino también que apesar de ser personas pobres sin ningun tipo de recursos monetarios les gusta vivir en lo limpio son una de las tantas atracciones turística del lugar. Es necesario acotar que no se si es 100% pacifica pero fui sola y los habitantes te orientan, en fin se lo recomiendo"
30,“Rio delle Meraviglie”,"Bellisima citta', da vedere ma troppo pericolosa e violenta, Copacabana un posto di blocco ogni 300 mt e in taxi viene rapinato uno straniero ogni ora...., paradossalmente le favelas sono un posto piu' sicuro della citta' commerciale, oceano pericoloso per bagnanti poco esperti e spiagge che pullulano di venditori opprimenti, locali notturni da favola ma spesso teatri di scontri e risse;l'hotel ti consiglia perfino quali luoghi frequentare non lasciandoti il libero arbitrio in nome della sicurezza personale.Troppo stress per una vacanza."
50,“maravilhoso”,"não existe outro lugar magnifico igual ao Rio de Janeiro não, as praias são lindas, bom restaurante e muito mais."
50,“a beleza natural do Rio de Janeiro é fabulosa”,"eu gosto de tudo que o Rio oferece sobretudo referente a natureza , essa cidade é uma das mais lindas do mundo cercada de morros verdes e mar, não tem como ficar alheio as belezas desse Rio de Janeiro"
40,“LA NOCHE”,"Estuve festejando mis 60 con un para de amigos y amigas todo muy lindo, paramos en el centro, cerca de los Arcos de Lapa, a la noche esta zona arde de boliches, restaurant, show en vivo y varias atracciones noctámbulas, pero encontré un boliche muy autóctono, se reúnen músicos en el centro y comienzan a cantar, es imposible no mover los pies y acompañar a los parroquianos en sus movimientos, es para beber y hay pocas mesas para sentarse, pero quien quiere asentar la cola, se llama LA VACA ATOLADA....maravillosa."
50,"“Caminando en Copacabana, ipanema y Botafogo”","Estuvimos visitando Río en Septiembre de 2013, por fortuna los 5 días tuvimos un hermoso Sol lo cual nos permitió realizar largas caminatas por las rutas más conocidas en Río las playas de Copacabana, Ipanema Botafogo... Solo necesitas un par de zapatos cómodos y buena disposición de caminar y conocer, se encuentran muchos restaurantes donde venden comida por peso (solo cobran lo que comas por peso), supermercados, tiendas de ropa y calzado, cuando llega la noche hay mucha gente en las esquinas de cafeterías bares, donde tocan guitarra o ponen musica suave brasilera, es muy agradable. La playa el fin de semana esta muy llena, peronalmente me agrado más entre semana se podia disfrutar más del sol y el mar con menos gente, menos posibilidades de tener percances de robos, aunque por fortuna nunca los tuvimos en nuestro viaje."
40,“Caminar por Rio de Janeiro”,"Rio es una Ciudad maravillosa, desde donde la mires. Puede ser desde las playas de Copacabana, con su inconfundible vereda con ondas o Ipanema, es ideal para caminar y divertirte. Puedes perderte entre sus calles, siempre a una hora adecuada y de día, que seguramente vas a encontrar a alguien que te guie o te indique como volver a tu ubicación. Puedes consultar tanto a la policia de turismo o cualquier otro integrante de alguna fuerza de seguridad y te indicarán el transporte conveniente. Puedes visitar el Jardin Botánico, o los museos, o simplemente instalarte en las playas y beber una deliciosa caipiriña. La temperatura siempre es agradable, especialmente en invierno que oscilan en los 28º, bajando un poco por la noche, aunque en verano son, por supuesto más altas. No te olvides de visitar el Cristo Redentor o el Pan de Azucar, hermosos para ver Rio desde lo alto. Ciudad maravillosa."
50,“Muito bom serviço”,"Há uma série de aventuras que se pode obter no Rio de Janeiro. Uma que indico é o rapel na pedra da Urca um visual vislumbrande de um dos maiores cartões postais da Cidade Maravilhosa, o Pão de Açucar."
40,“legal”,gostei muito e bom conhecer esse tipo de lugares o rio é lindo paraa assistir o pôr-do-sol: pedra do Arpoador! Banho de mar em Ipanema maravilhoso. A praia conta com água limpa e um horizonte de perder de vista.
40,“paseo de compras cerca del puerto”,"Si van a Rio de Janeiro, no pueden dejar de pasar por el paseo de compras a pocas cuadras del puerto, donde se llena de colorido las calles, exiten todo tipo de ofertas a muy buenos precios y se revive el estado de animo del brasil. En horario diurno no existe ningun problema de inseguridad, y vale la pena visitarlo. Tuve la posibilidad de ir en crucero al brasil, y en Rio, pasamos la noche. Una experiencia inolvidable."
30,“Überbewertet”,"Rio de Janeiro haben wir mit gemischten Gefühlen verlassen, da wir durch die Berichte in den deutschen Medien große Erwartungen hatten, die allerdings nicht ganz erfüllt werden konnten.Sehr gut sind die öffentlichen Verkehrsanbindungen und von der oft hierzulande berichteten Kriminalität haben wir glücklicherweise nicht mitbekommen (wir waren allerdings auch nicht spätnachts in Problemvierteln unterwegs)!Sehr zu empfehlen sind natürlich die touristischen Highlights ""Zuckerhut"" und ""Christusstatue"".Von den Stränden ""Ipanema"" und ""Copacabana"" waren wir allerdings enttäuscht. Sie sind breit und es gibt einige Strandbuden, aber das war´s auch schon: kein besonderes Flair und auch durch die Trennung des Strandes und der Uferpromenade durch eine breite Straße vom Rest der Stadt, gibt es kaum interessante Geschäfte.Die Restaurants, die mit einem Blick auf den Strand werben können, bieten Speisen und Getränke zu überhöhten Preisen an.Zwei Tage Rio de Janeiro reichen eigentlich aus."
40,“Historisches Rio de Janeiro”,"Ich war Anfang Mai 2011 erstmals in Rio de Janeiro und mir angesichts der Berichte über die Kriminialität etwas unsicher, inwiefern ich die Stadt auf eigene Faust erkunden sollte (was ich sonst immer gerne mache). Da ich beruflich in Porto Alegre zu tun hatte und deshalb ohnehin nur zwei Tage vor Ort war, entschloss ich mich zu einer individuellen Stadtführung in deutscher Sprache und landete bei meiner Recherche im Internet bei Lisa Schnittger. Lisa ist eine Deutsche, die seit vielen Jahren bereits in der Stadt lebt und sich mit einem eigenen Reiseservice selbstständig gemacht. Ich hatte mich im Vorfeld per email mit Lisa ausgetauscht und für eine halbtägige Tour (bewusst fernab von Zuckerhut und Corcovado) durch das historsche Rio entschieden. Weder die Stadt noch Lisa selbst haben mich enttäuscht. Lisa holte mich netterweise direkt am Hotel ab, und gemeinsam haben wir dann mit der Metro und zu Fuss die Stadt in Angriff genommen. ""Walking Tour"" nennt Lisa das, und es ist augenscheinlich die intensivste Art, eine solch faszinierende Stadt kennenzulernen. Wir tauchten tief ein ins Centro, und Lisa zeigte mir diverse Gebäude, Kirchen und die herrliche Architektur der Stadt, gepaart mit reichlich Fachinformationen. Lisa brachte mir die Infos zu Rios Geschichte und die enge Verbindung zu den Portugiesen humorvoll und charmant rüber (manchmal waren es vielleicht etwas zu viel Infos - man hatte ab und zu Schwierigkeiten, alles aufzusaugen). Die tolle Architektur, die Fahrt mit der Bonde in den Stadtteil Santa Teresa (incl. Überfahrt des Akquädukts - eher nichts für Leute mit Höhenangst...) und die Besichtigung der Kacheltreppe Escaderia Selaron waren faszinierend, und Lisa ist augenscheinlich gut vernetzt in den Bezirken. Wer mal ´ne Pause braucht, mit dem geht Lisa ins Café Colombo, eine Art ""Wiener Kafeehaus"" mitten im Zentrum - genial! Ich kann Lisa auf jeden Fall weiterempfehlen, alle Absprachen wurden zu 100% eingehalten und auf individuelle Interessen wird jederzeit eingegangen. Ich habe die Walking Tour allein mit ihr gemacht, ansonsten sind idR zwei, drei weitere Touristen mit im Schlepptau. Lisa ist im web unter www.lisariotours.com zu erreichen. Viel Spass in dieser Traumstadt wünscht Euch Oliver aus Hannover"
30,“С культовостью- перебор...”,"Посещение Рио изначально перед моей поездкой в Бразилию представлялось одним из важных моментов этой поездки, потому что этот город, на мой взгляд, является одним из символов Бразилии. Для пребывания в Рио я отвёл 5 дней, причём остановиться решил прямо на первой линии в Копакабане.Первое из неприятного, что сразу бросилось в глаза- это излишняя нервозность жителей города, прямо как в Москве: идёшь по улице, люди танками прут прямо на тебя, запросто могут толкнуть и даже никто не извинится, а если не успеешь отойти и не уступишь дорогу, то некоторые ещё начинают орать и обзывать... Кстати, сервис в магазинах и кафе- тоже далеко не потрясающий, а вот цены- самые высокие в Бразилии.В Рио мне запомнилась пара моментов, когда я спрашивал у местных жителей дорогу к определённому месту и они мне показывали эту дорогу, но, как оказывалось позднее, эта дорога была прямо противоположной той, которая мне была нужна- такого я вообще не встречал ни в одной стране мира. Может, жителям города просто уже порядком надоели туристы и таким образом кариоки показывают свой негатив; или, может, люди сами не знали дороги, но им неудобно было отказать в ответе- честно говоря, я даже не мог понять причины...Рио, безусловно, является культовым бразильским городом со множеством культовых мест, но я бы назвал его прежде всего ""городом несбывшихся ожиданий"", то есть перед посещением города представляешь его какой-то сказкой, а когда попадаешь в Рио, то всё, раннее представленное, либо не соответствует представлениям, либо становится чересчур обыденным, поэтому впечатления о городе несколько притупляются. Да и свободно передвигаться по городу туристам не представляется возможным, потому что очень высока преступность, и даже мэрия города выпустила постановление, согласно которому туристам не рекомендуется самостоятельно покидать так называемую ""зону зул"" (это Копакабана, Ипанема, Леблон), но даже и в пределах этой ""зоны зул"" по вечерам небезопасно- лично я с наступлением темноты вообще старался пешком никуда не ходить... В Копакабане круглосуточно прямо перед гостиницей на проспекте Атлантика (я лично сам это видел из своего номера) тусовались какие-то подозрительные люди, которые постоянно останавливали прохожих и просили у них деньги, причём эта тусовка к вечеру только увеличилась, там была в основном молодёжь, и они постоянно бегали туда-сюда и что-то кричали. Да и вообще Копакабана по сравнению с Ипанемой выглядит гораздо более грязной и шумной, поэтому лично я бы посоветовал туристам останавливаться в Ипанеме.На все экскурсии выдвигался с гидами и на транспорте, так что удалось побывать и пофотографировать в различных районах города и даже вблизи фавел- честно говоря, в Рио как-то очень сильно ощущается, в отличие от Сан-Паулу, разница между богатыми и бедными кварталами, и в Рио как-то больше грязи и необустроенности: едешь по городу и как-то хаотично разбросаны постройки, причём рядом с какой-нибудь шикарной высоткой может располагаться куча фавел. Центр города застроен небоскрёбами и довольно красивый, много достопримечательностей.Городское метро понравилось, но проезд недешёвый, и само метро, видимо, проведено далеко не в большинство районов города; к тому же в метро было немного душновато- видимо, недостаточно эффективное кондиционирование.В целом, город нормальный, посетить его, безусловно, нужно хотя бы раз в жизни, а в дальнейшем- это уже на усмотрение каждого..."
50,"“Rio de Janeiro, die wunderbare Stadt”","Nach langen Hin und Her und gewissen Bedenken wegen der Sicherheitslage sind wir nach Rio de Janeiro angekommen.Empfehlenswert:- Fruchtsäfte in den verschiedenen ""Juice bars"" in Copacabana- Zuckerhut- Cristo - Absoluter highlight von Rio- Die Leute in Rio sind immer angenehm und hilfsbereit, eine positive Ueberraschung- Lapa-Viertel um nachts auszugehenNicht empfehlenswert:- Copacabana Strand: Eines der schlechtesten in Rio, viel besser ist Ipanema - Leblon.- Nachts lieber alle Strände vermeiden"
40,"“Tolle Stadt, besser als ihr Ruf”","Wir hatten nicht viel Zeit, zwei Nächte, ein voller Tag. Aber wir haben die zeit gut genutzt und sehr genossen. wir machten eine bus-Tour mit allen Highlights wie Corcovado-Hügel mit der Christus-Figur, Zuckerhut, Carneval-Meile, Maracana-Stadion, Copacabana- und Ipanema-Strand. Hotel am Copacabana-Strand, ein Abend in den Kneipen von Lapa. Die Stadt hat eine tolle Geografie mit tollen Buchten, Hügeln, Regenwald. Die Stadt ist für uns viel besser als ihr Ruf, gut organsiert, kein Verkehrschaos, keine gefährlich erscheinenden Situationen, freundliche Leute."
40,“Hay que conocerlo!”,"Rio de janeiro, una ciudad controvertida en alguna época.Digo controvertida por el tema seguridad.Hoy es una ciudad bellisima, con mucho para concoer y mucho para hacer.Mi experencia ha sido muy positiva.Respecto a la seguridad que era el tema que más nos preocupaba a la hora de viajar, no tuvimos problemas. Obviamente tomamos los recaudos necesarios cuando uno se mueve en las grandes ciudades.Por ejemplo: si van a la playa, no descuiden sus pertenencias. Si caminan por la calle, no lo hagan ostentando sus celulares ultimos modelos, o joyas.Nosotros hemos estado hasta las 22 horas caminando por Copacabana y no tuvimos ningun tipo de problema, había policia turistica.Tamién fuimos en metro al centro a visitar el Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes y no tuvimos ningun tipo de problemas, obviamente viajamos en un horario de día.con mi familia estuvimos sólo tres días y nos quedamos con ganas de conocer más. Porque por ejemplo, hicimos la excursion al corcovado pero no pudimos hacer la del pan de azucar, tambien fuimos a la playa de copacabana y solo pudimos ir un día a Ipanema y nos hubiera gustado estar algunos días más para disfrutar mucho más.definitivamente, volveré a Rio algun día!"
50,“Rio - ein Traum wird wahr”,"Ich habe Rio de Janeiro bereits fünfmal einen Besuch abgestattet und jedesmal konnte ich etwas anderes entdecken. Sei es den Zuckerhut, die Christusstatue oder die Strände, Rio erzeugt bei mir ein Urlaubsgefühl der besonderen Art. Aufgrund der anstehenden Fußball WM und Olympischen Spielen wirkt die Stadt mittlerweile sehr sicher auf mich. Also, nichts wie hin nach Rio de Janeiro."
50,“copacabana -unica-”,"Rio de Janeiro identificada como la gran ciudad imponente por sus edificios tambien tiene sus momentos de paz ,las vistas desde el piso 11 a la playa .son realmente inolvidables.COPACABANA .lejos del bullicio del dia,es diferente y admirable."
40,“Tolle Stadt voller Kontraste”,"Beim ersten Besuch Rios ist man zunächst von der schieren Größe der Stadt beeindruckt und gleichzeitig erschlagen. Unzählige Stadtviertel reihen sich vom bergigen Hinterland zur Küste hin und die Fahrt vom Flughafen nach bspw. Leblon dauert etwa 40 min.Vielen gutgemeinten Ratschlägen wg. häufigen Diebstaählen und Überfällen wurde bewusst auf das tragen einer Uhr und sehr auffälliger Kleidung verzichtet. Insgesamt laufen die ""cariocas"" auch eher lässig durch die Stadt, was man angesichts der vielen Strände und der Wärme durchaus verstehen kann. Trotzdem habe ich eigentlich zu keinem Zeitpunkt das Gefühl gehabt mich in einer unsicheren Umgebung zu bewegen. Als wichtigstes,einfachstes und günstigstes Transportmittel kann der normale Stadtbus und die Metro genutzt werden. Die Fahrten kosten etwa 1,20€ pro Person. Nach Sonnenuntergang bzw. am späten Abend bin ich jedoch nicht mehr mit dem Bus gefahren, daher kann ich dies nicht bewerten.Generell sind alle einheimischen sehr nett und hilfsbereit gewesen, mti einigen Spanischkenntnissen kommt man ebenfalls ein wenig weiter.Beste Reisezeiten sind der europäische Herbst und Winter (dortiger Frühling und Sommer). Zum Karneval ebenfalls sehr empfehlenswert, allerdings ist das Wetter nicht mehr sehr stabil, wir hatten des Öfteren Regenschauer und auch einen bedeckten Himmel. (Gerade für Attraktionen wie Corcovado und Zuckerhut sehr ärgerlich)Insgesamt ist die Stadt sehr empfehlenswert man sollte sich jedoch darauf einstellen, dass die Preise in den meisten Restaurants und Bars eher mitteleuropäischen Charakter haben und nicht wirklich günstiger als vglw. in Deutschland sind.Schönste Strände sind Leblon / Ipanema, Barra, Copacabana.Zum Shopping begibt man sich am besten in eins der vielen Shoppingcenter(bspw. Shopping Leblon, Shopping Barra etc.)Absolute must-haves sind:Zuckerhut, Corcovado, Jardim Botanico, Fahrt auf eine der vorgelagerten Inseln (bspw. Paqueta)"
40,“La patria del capodanno”,"Sono stato a Rio de Janeiro a Capodanno 2011, e pur avendo speso il doppio rispetto ad un altro periodo dell'anno, sono veramente contento della mia scelta. La notte sulla spiaggia è stata fantastica: tutti vestiti di bianco che cantavano e ballavano; nessuno ubriaco si respirava un'aria di festa inimmaginabile nei vari veglioni nelle piazze idaliane. Mezzora di fuochi a mezzanotte indimenticabili. A parte questo forse non c'è molto altro da vedere a Rio, tolto il Pan di Zucchero e Il Cristo Redentore. Consiglio quindi a tutti di recarsi a Rio a Capodanno o a Carnevale, perchè la cosa particolare non è quel che si visita ma l'atmosfera che si vive."
50,“la mia citta' preferita”,"rio de janeiro e' la citta' piu' allegra e simpatica che abbia mai visto, ho avuto la fortuna di viaggiare per il mondo, ma solo a rio mi fermerei a vivere, la citta' ti prende ti trasporta, con le sue meravogliose spiagge ed i suoi fantastici panorami, il popolo poi' e' il piu' solare del mondo.non manca nulla, il mare, il lago, la montagna ... adora questa citta' , adoro passeggiare sul calcadao di copacabana ed ammirare ogni bellezza del posto."
50,“RIO: UNA CITTA' DAI MILLE COLORI”,"Rio de Janeiro e' stata la prima citta' fondata dai Portoghesi.Quando arrivi a Rio ed esci dall'aeroporto, senti l'atmosfera di questa citta'.La prima attrazione che visiti e il Corcovado (dove c'e' la statua del Redentore). Per arrivare sopra a 750 metri d'altezza, ci sono due modi: la prima sali sulla strada panoramica (con i vari tornati), la seconda prendi il famoso Tram Rosso e viaggi dentro il parco nazionale.Arrivati in cima, per proseguire devi prendere gli ascensori, che ti portano dove c'e' questa immensa statua.Una volta arrivati sul piazzale vedi Rio a 360 gradi, e da lontano vedi il mitico stadio piu' grande del mondo il Maracana'.Una volta che hai visto Rio in tutta la sua bellezza, incominci a fotografare il Cristo Redentore nella sua immensa grandiosita'.Finita la visita, ti portano in un'altro posto, il Pao de Azucar (il Pan di Zucchero).Per andare sopra devi prendere la telefelica, e una volta arrivati, anche qui vedi Rio a 360 gradi e le famose spiagge di Copacabana e Ipanena.Consiglio a chi non e' andato a Rio de Janeiro, di visitarla, che ne vale la pena."
50,“viaje a rio en verano 2011”,"Hola!! estuve en rio de janeiro del 6 al 22 de enero (2011). Es la segunda vez que voy y sigue siendo una de las ciudades más maravillosas que conozco. No duden en ir!!!La seguridad es impresionante, viajé con mi familia y ningun problema. Alquilé un apartamento en Copacabana muy cómodo a un precio razonable. En general para los de mi país está muy caro todo (uruguay) pero nada demasiado como para no poder disfrutar.Si alguien necesita le puedo proporcionar datos.Un saludo para todos y animense a Rio que vale la pena!!!Alicia"
40,“La citta' meravigliosa”,"Piu' che una recensione vuole essere un insieme di suggerimenti per chi visitera' Rio de Janeiro, una citta' unica e fantastica...Spiaggia: Ipanema posto 9Attenzione alle correnti e alle onde a Ipanema... divertentissime quanto pericolose.Locali notturni (Bar e disco)Quartiere Lapa: la “Testaccio/Trastevere” di Roma, piena di bar e localetti...Rio Scenarium – bellissimo!!! Attenzione a stare li presto; se si va dopo le 22 si rischia di non entrare piu’... si puo' andare anche a cena e proseguire la serata; il weekend intorno a mezzanotte la serata prosegue con “musica elettronica” fino all’alba.- Carioca da Gema (piccolino rispetto al Rio Scenarium, ma c’e’ sempre la fila nei weekend- Nuth Barra (bello, occhio a non farti portare al Nuth lagoo troppo piccolo...) – quartiere Barra- Nossa sem’Hora! in Rua de Nossa Senhora do Copacabana – quartiere CopacabanaDa visitare:- Pan di zucchero (si sale con la teleferica)- Corcovado (Cristo Redentore)Prendendo un tour di Rio di un giorno si vedono entrambi insieme al Sambodromo, lo stadio Maracana’ (solo da fuori, e’ in ristrutturazione per i mondiali 2014 all’interno), il sambodromo e la cattedrale (centro citta’). Il biglietto costa intorno ai 140 Reais (circa 65 euro) e include tutti i biglietti (inclusa la teleferica per il Pan di zucchero) ed il pranzo a buffet (escluso bevande).- quartiere di Santa Teresa (dove passa il trenino): fatevi portare da un taxi al Bar do Mineiro, lasciate il nome per mettervi in fila per il pranzo e poi fate una passeggiata nelle vicinanze...- arco/acquedotto di Lapa: prendendo il tram ci passate sopra...Dove mangiare:- bar do mineiro nel quartiere di Santa Teresa: locale rumorosissimo, e incasinato, per assaggiare la feijoada;in alternativa li vicino trovate Sobrenatural o Bar do Arnaudo carini e con meno fila- ristorante “Garota de Ipanema” ad Ipanema – ottimo sia per il pesce che per la carne- come fast food, per un pasto veloce magari a pranzo, consiglio la catena Gallitos dove mangiare mezzo galletto ben cotto con patatine fritte, riso bianco, il tutto bagnato da una buona birra... ce ne sono tre (dei quali uno a Ipanema e uno a Copacabana)Suggerimenti:Premetto che a me a Rio non e’ successo nulla e mi e’ sembrata fin troppo sicura, ma inoltro i consigli che ho seguito personalmente:- lasciate gli oggetti di valore in hotel- fate la fotocopia del passaporto. Il passaporto lasciatelo sempre in hotel (se possibile in cassaforte insieme agli oggetti di valore, soldi o altro)- la sera portate sempre con voi la fotocopia del passaporto: e' necessaria per entrare nei locali- di giorno muovetevi in tranquillita’ anche con i mezzi (ovviamente nei quartieri turistici-raccomandabili, inutili dirvi di evitare le favelas...); la sera muovetevi con i taxi dall’hotel ai locali dove volete andare."
30,“Bin unentschlossen”,"Hatte mir ehrlich gesagt mehr erwartet von Rio de Janeiro. Irgendwie wollte kein wirkliches Feeling aufkommen. Die Straßen immer total überlaufen und die Leute unfreundlich.... Copa Cabana, Zuckerhut und Cristo Redendon waren die einzigen schönen Orte in dieser Stadt...."
30,“Rio de Janeiro - schön aber gefährlich”,"Eine Stadt welche man schwer in Worten beschreiben kann. Die Lage von Rio ist wunderschön und auch die Sehenswürdigkeiten muss man gesehen haben, wäre da nicht die Sicherheit, könnte man diese City als einer der sehenswertesten der Welt bezeichnen. Zuerst mal das Positive. Die Stände Copacabana und Ipanema sind wirklich eine Augenweide, wobei der letztgenannte weitaus schöner und sauberer ist. Copacabana lebt nur von Namen und vom Blick auf den Zuckerhut. Der Höhepunkt von Rio ist ""Corcovado"" und seine Christus Statue. Die 38 Meter hohe Statue liegt 710 Meter über Rio und ist nicht nur für einen gläubigen Christ ein Augenöffner. Corcovado liegt im Nationalpark Parque Nacional da Tijuca und sollte nur bei guten Wetterbedingungen besucht werden. Die letzten Meter zur Statue fährt man mit organisieren Shuttlebussen. Die Ausblicke von der Statue rund um Rio sind umwerfend. Je später man anreist, desto mehr behindert die Sonne den Blick auf die Statue. Meines Erachtens eignet sich der frühe Nachmittag am Besten. Der zweite Höhepunkt von Rio ist zweifelsohne ""Pae de Acucar"" (Sugarloaf). Mit einer Seilbahn gelangt man über einen kleinen Zwischenhügel zum 395 Meter hohen Zuckerhut. Von hier aus hat man umwerfende Aussichten auf Downtown, Copacabana und die Christ Statue. Ich würde man späten Nachmittag anreisen und die untergehende Sonne von hier aus bewundern. Die Schatten die sich dann über der Stadt bilden sind super Photomotive. Der Eintritt kostet: 44 BRL. Ganz interessant in Rio ist auch Downtown mit seiner architektonisch außergewöhnlichen Kathedrale und seinen Hochhäusern. Ein Besuch wert ist auch die schöne Kirche ""Igreja de Nossa Senhora de Candelaria"" und der Stadtteil St. Teresa. Das Stadion Maracana war bei meiner Besuch bereits für die WM2014 gesperrt. Der beste Platz zum Übernachten, Shoppen und Essen ist definitiv Ipanema. Dies ist auch mit Abstand sicherste Fleck von Rio. Leider! In der Nacht sollte man unbedingt Taxis ( gibt es zehntausende ) benutzen. Auf keinem Falle darf man am Stand einen nächtlichen Spaziergang unternehmen oder in Seitenstraßen herumgehen. Wirklich! Sehr gefährlich. Die ganze Stadt besteht aus Armenvierteln, sog. Favelas. Fern ab von Copacabana gibt es fast nichts anderes. Ich hatte die Gelegenheit nach einem Fußballspiel im Olympic Stadion die Stadt komplett zu durchfahren. teilweise echt erschreckend, wie arm die Leute hier sind. Alle Wertgegenstände muss man im Hotel lassen und auf keinem Falle Ringe und Schmuck tragen. Am besten in lockerer Kleidung rumlaufen und nichts Unnötiges dabeihaben. Die Stadt zu besichtigen dauert einen halben tag, den Rest kann man am Strand verbringen. Hier gilt auch, nichts Unnötiges und Wertvolles mitnehmen. Diebstahl ist gerade in Rio an der Tagesordnung. Noch ein paar Ausgehtipps. Ein abendlicher Drink im Vorzeigehotel Copacabana Palace ist rein von der Atmosphäre her genial. Ist allerdings ein wenig teuer. Das beste, angesagteste Hotel der Stadt liegt natürlich in Ipanema und heißt Fasano. Als Restaurant kann ich das Frontera ebenfalls in Ipanema empfehlen. Wer ein Souvenir kaufen möchte liegt mit einer kleinen Christusstatue und brasilianischen Havaianas ( Badeschlappen ) genau richtig. Zum Flughafen fährt man am Besten mit dem Taxi. kann schon mal je nach Tageszeit eine Stunde dauern und kostet so 70 BRL."
40,“schön aber gefährlich”,ich war bereits mehrfach in dieser Stadt. Übernachtet hatte ich in der Nähe und an der Copacabana. Esist wirklich schön hier. Die Menschen sind freundlich und das Wetter oft sehr gut. Es gibt vieles zu sehen. Leider ist da aber das zweite Gesicht. Man darf nichts wertvollles an sich haben. An Geld nur das notwendigste mitnehmen. in der Stadt gibt es Plätze an denen bist du nicht einmal sicher wenn ein Polizist bei dir ist. Trotzdem würde ich immer wieder hierhin zurück kommen.
50,“Wow! Gigantische Energie!”,"Man spürt sofort die andere energetische Wolke, dabei sind die Leute dort sehr entspannt und locker. Man erwartet nicht die entwickelte Infrastruktur, ist man aber positiv überascht. Einziges was man nicht erwartet - Rio ist sehr teuer, und es ist nicht unbedingt mit dem gutem Qualität verbunden...Besondere Empfehlung - Silvester auf Copacobana, Einmalig!"
50,“Traumstadt”,Rio ist eine unglaubliche Stadt. Man hasst sie oder liebt sie - aber die meisten Leute lieben sie eindeutig.Das Setting ist einmalig mit grünen Hügeln und blauem Meer und endlosen Stränden.Nightlife pur und viel Action wie auch kulturelle Sehenswürdigkeiten nebst den Must's wie Zuckerhut und Corcovado.Aufpassen dass man nicht in ein Armenviertel reinläuft - die sind ganz nah an den Touristenzonen.Rio ist super.
50,“Die schönste Stadt auf Erden”,"Für mich gehört Rio zu einer der schönsten wenn nicht zur schönsten Stadt auf der ganzen Welt. RIo de Janeiro bedeutet Fluss des Jänners. Rio liegt sie malerisch an der Guanabarabucht ist, die jedoch aber nur irrtümlich für eine Flussmündung gehlaten wurde. Rio ist nicht nur bekannt für seine Buchten und Strände (wie der Copacabana und dem Ipanema Strand). Malerisch liegt Rio zwischen den Steinbergen, sogenannten Morros. Die 2 bekanntesten Morros der Stadt (die häufig für ein und den selben Berg gehalten werden) sind der Zuckerhut sowie der Corcovado, auf dem die weltbekante Christusstatue von Rio steht.Beide zählen zu Hauptsehenswürdigkeiten, die man keinesfalls auslassen darf, wenn man von einem kompletten Rio Besuch sprechen möchte.Wir waren im August, alsoin brasiliens Winter. Für unsere Verhältnisse war es wunderschön warm, auch das Meer hatte genug Temperatur, um sich (nicht nur sprichwörtlich) in die Fluten zu stürzen. Am Strand befinden sich Informationen zu den Wasserströmungen. Diese sollten von den Badenixen umbedingt beachtet werden."
50,"“Mi ciudad preferida, la mas bella!”","La ciudad que mas me gusta, espectaculares playas como la de Barra de Tijuca, Ipanema, buena onda del carioca, riquisimas caipirinhas, buen clima, buenos hoteles, buenos espectáculos, buenos shoppings. Cerca de lugares tan bellos como Buzios, que está a unos 220 kms aprox. con sus playas fantásticas, y su glamour. Hacia el Sur está la inigualable Angra dos Reis, islas maravillosas para hacer paseos en barco, escuchando música, tomando bebidas, comiendo frutas, y zambullendose desde el barco a ese mar tan lindo. También al sur está Paraty, pueblo de pescadores, increible. Hay de todo para hacer, para recorrer, para conocer. Es una zona maravillosa. Hay muchísimo mas.No dejen de ir si tienen la oportunidad, verán que realmente vale mucho la pena. No necesariamente es peligroso, ni se vive un loco carnaval, se puede hacer la vida que uno quiera, de mucha noche o de mucha calma, playa y sol. Hay para todos los gustos.Y como seguridad, llendo sin oro ni nada a la vista, andando simple, nunca en las 6 veces que fui tuve ningun tipo de problema. Es como cualquier otra ciudad. El brasilero es muy solidario, simpático y servicial, tienen una buena onda genial, y no se meten para nada donde no los llaman. ESPECTACULAR BRASIL!! Y RIO Una maravilla."
40,“wunderbere Stadt”,"eine wundervolle Stadt, trotz aller Probleme in den Favelas. Insgesamt ist der Aufenthalt auch am Tage nicht ungefaehrlich, wir haben am 25.12.2010 einen Ueberfall auf eine asiatische Touristin um 14.00 Uhr miterlebt. Die Sehenswuerdigkeiten Zuckerhut und Cocorvado sind ueberwaeltigend, die alte Strassenbahn nach Santa Teresa ein Erlebnis."
50,“Das Wahrzeichen Brasiliens”,"Rio de Janeiro gehört sicherlich zu den bekanntesten Städten auf unserem Planeten. Jeder verbindet die Stadt sofort mit Zuckerhut,Christusstatue was sicherlich auch gerechtfertigt ist weil diese einmaligen Sehenswürdigkeiten das Stadtbild sehr prägen. Aber Rio hat durchaus mehr zu bieten als die Copacabana und die anderen Touristenzentren. So lohnt auch ein Besuch des historischen Zentrums oder des ""Künstlerviertels"" Santa Teresa"
40,“Weltenbummler”,"Rio de Janeiro hat mir sehr gut gefallen,obwohl wir uns drei Jahre überlegt hatten dort hin zu reisen, wegen der vielen Warnungen vor Überfällen etc.Wir haben uns zu keiner Zeit bedroht gefühlt, haben uns aber auch nicht Nachts draussen aufgehalten oder Schmuck getragen.Die Copacabana bei tollem Sonnenschein mit einem Caipirinha in der Hand zu geniessen ist ein Muss.Natürlich sind wir auch die Copacabana entlang spaziert, in Verbindung mit dem Strand von Ipanema.Das Highlight sind natürlich der Zuckerhut und der Corcovado!Einfach toll die Aussicht von dort oben,das Wetter spielte Gott sei Dank mit.Die Eintrittspreise sind allerdings auch nicht billig ,ca. 20 Euro p.P.Taxen sind auch teuer.Wir sind oft mit den einheimischen Bussen gefahren.Ist günstig und macht Spass, weil die Bevölkerung einen gerne anspricht und auch weiterhilft mit den versch.Buslinien und Stationen.Man verständigt sich gerne mit Händen und Füssen und es klappt sogar.Das Hinterland mit den Armenvierteln haben wir nicht besucht, da gerade zu der Zeit dort Aufstände waren, weil die Polizei ,lt.Einheimischen,endlich durchgegriffen hat.Alles in allem war es ein toller Aufenthalt in Rio de Janeiro."
40,“BEste Stadt in Brasilien”,"Diese Stadt MUSS man gesehen haben. Wir waren im Winter dort und konnten bei 30 Grad an der Copa Cabana liegen.Eine Fahrt zum Zuckerhut sowie zur Jesusstatue sind ein Muss.Kriminalität: klar, ist dort, aber wenn man Schmuck, teure Uhren und alles andere, was auf Reichtum schließen könnte zu Hause lässt, sollte das kein Problem darstellen."
50,“Traumstadt”,"Rio zählt sicherlich zu den schönsten Städten der Welt. Zu Recht!Die Copa Cabana ist nicht nur wegen den schönen Frauen ein Traum. Einen Blick hinab von der Chisto-Statue auf den Zuckerberg vergisst man nie! Die Menschen sind aufgeschlossen und freundlich. Das Essen köstlich! Saftbars an denen es frisch gepresste Fruchtsäfte gibt findet man an jeder Ecke. Achtung, nicht ins falsche Viertel verirren!"
50,“SCHÖNE Guanabara-Bucht !”,Eines der interessantesten Buchten in Brasilien. Die 38 Meter hohe Christusfigur beschützt die ganze Stadt. Muss man gesehen haben. Leute sind freundlich. Mit wenig Geld lernt man tolle Frauen kennen. Das Leben macht Spass in Rio. Ich besuche immer Sambaschulen. Die Besten der Welt !!!
50,"“Rio de janeiro, una ciudad espectacular y amigable!”","Viajé a Rio en octubre 2010, y estuve 10 días. La ciudad me encantó, una belleza natural incomparable. La gente super amigable y colaboradora. Yo no hablo portugués, hablo español pero hasta en la calle la gente se esmera por responder a las preguntas que uno pueda realizar. Estuve alojada en Copacabana, y no sentí sensación de inseguridad alguna. Hay policia por todos lados. Recomiendo este destino!"
50,"“Rio, eine Schölnheit mit verzeihlichen Fehlern”","Rio ist eine Stadt der Gegensätze, wobei die Motivation für das Schöne und Positive überwiegen. Arm und reich, gezeichnet und schön, trist und ektatisch, kaum gegensätzlicheres könnte man finden. Die Anatomie dieser Stadt ist faszinierend, Berge verdecken Strände, Strände geben Berge frei. Man sieht Lateinamerika, man sieht Portugal...es ist faszinierend"
50,“Ein Naturparadies mit atemberaubender Schönheit”,"Wer an Südamerika denkt, wer träumt dann nicht von Rio de Janeiro in Brasilien. Ein wahrhaft wunderschöner Ort mit einigen der besten und schönsten Stränder der Welt und unzählige Sehenswürdigkeiten wie die Jesus-Statue auf dem Berg Corcovado, der Zuckerhut auf den man mit zwei Seilbahnen hinaufgefahren wird, das Maracana Stadion, das Platz für mehr als 100.000 Zuschauer bietet und somit das größte Stadion der Welt ist. Dies sind nur einige von den vielen interessanten Touristenattraktionen dieser Metropole im Paradies. Ich war sehr positiv überrascht von dieser Stadt und kann nur absolut jedem empfehlen, wenn die Möglichkeit besteht, diesen Ort einmal mit den eigenen Augen gesehen zu haben."
30,“Unvergleichliche Strände”,"Rio de Janeiro ist sicher ein unvergessliches Erlebnis. Es gibt wirklich traumhafte Strände und jede Menge an tollen Sehenswürdigkeiten. Den Zuckerhut und die Statue am Corcovado sollte man sich auf jeden Fall ansehen. Bei der Tour auf den Zuckerhut sollte man bei Schönwetter etwa 2-3 Stunden einplanen, denn es gibt einen tollen Aussichtsplatz mit Liegestühlen und gemütlichen Holzgarnituren wo man schon mal etwas mehr Zeit verbringen kann. Der Strand von Ipanema ist etwas weniger touristisch als die Gegend um die Copacabana. Allerdings ist der Stadtteil Ipanema insgesamt auch teurer.Das Zentrum von Rio wirkte abends auf mich persönlich nicht wirklich sicher, weshalb ich über das Nachtleben auch nichts berichten kann. Achtung, in Rio geht die Sonne ziemlich früh unter (im September schon gegen 17.30 Uhr) - am besten im Hotel nach der genauen Zeit erkundigen wenn man spätere Ausflüge plant.""Typische Souvenirs"" wie den Zuckerhut oder die Christusstatue bekommt man nur bei den Sehenswürdigkeiten selbst oder in der Gegend um die Copacabana (dort etwas günstiger), im Zentrum sucht man solche Dinge vergebens."
40,“FANTASTICO”,"Llegamos a Rio y no sabiamos donde hospedarnos gracias al taxista Anderson, consegui alquilar por 7 dias un departamento en Rua Min Viveiros a dos cuadras de la playa Copacabana, amoblado, 3 habitaciones, mas cuarto de servicio, nos costò 840 reales las 6 noches, el depa bien situado con portero . A media cuadra, hay un super market y panaderia que atendian las 24 horas y en la playa todos los cafes, y bares para los que nos gusta salir en la noche .Nos fue fantastico playa, comida y depa todo cercaAdoro Rio su gente, su playa, su clima.Ada"
50,“Lugar ideal para vacionar”,"Tuvimos la oportunidad de vacionar en Río de Janeiro y les aseguro que no van a encontrar mejor lugar para vacacionar que éste, nosotros la pasamos 10 punto, el Hotel (el Copacavana), es exelente, la atención es muy buena, todos los cariocas son muy amables, las playas ni hablar, son divinas, las visitas la Cristo y al Pan de azucar, son espectaculares, las vista de la bahís es sensacional, ni les cuento las excursiones a Angras Do Rey y Bucio, son impagables, les puedo asegurar que mientra viva no me voy a olvidar de los paisajes y el mar de esos lugares, se los recomiendo no se pueden perder unas vaciones en Río.Gracias Hugo. Santa Fe Argentina."
40,“Einen Kurzurlaub wert”,"Rio de Janeiro ist auf Jeden Fall einen Kurzurlaub wert! Ich würde hier zwar keine 2-3 Wochen verbringen, aber für einen Aufenthalt von 5 Tagen, steht ausreichend gutes Programm zur Verfügung!Neben den üblichen Sehenswürdigkeiten wie dem Corcovado und dem Zuckerhut ist auch ""Petropolis"" auf jeden Falle einen Ausflug wert! Eine nette kleine Kolonialstadt mit ganz eigenem Flair!Mein persönlicher Tipp (nachdem ich hier beinahe 4 Monate verbracht habe) ist jedoch einmal ab von den touristischen Pfaden wie der Coppacabana zu schauen und einen wirklich schönen Strand zu besuchen, wie zum Beispiel Barra da Tijuca oder Recreio, andem sie sich ohne Angst vor Überfällen viel freier und vor allem unter ausgesprochen freundlichen Einheimischen bewegen können!Für Männer: Ein Besuch des Maracana Stadions ist unbedingt zu empfehlen! Ein Live Spiel sorgt für Gänsehaut und man wird von den eingefleischten Fans einfach in deren Bann gezogen und ma fiebert bei jeder kleinsten Ballberührung mit. Karten kosten zwischen 40,- oder 50,- Real (etwa 20-25 Euro)Für Frauen: Das bekannte Shoppingcenter ""Barra Shopping"" lässt Frauenherzen höher schlagen! - Achten Sie aber auf die unterschiedlich ausgeschriebenen Größen (USA / EUR) und die manchmal verwirrenden Preise (oftmals sind die Preise in Ratenzahlungen angeschrieben, also auch auf das Kleingedruckte achten!)"
40,“Rio de Janeiro eine traumhafte Stadt zum abschalten”,"Eine traumhafte Stadt eingebettet in einem Dschungel und ausgestattet mit wundervollen Stränden. Abhängen und Relaxen ist hier mit dem gebotenem Lifestyle wirklich unvergleichlich. Zu empfehlen ist auch eine Stadtbesichtigung, wobei mir Santa Theresa am besten gefiel. Ein Höhepunkt ist auch der Besuch der vorgelagerten Inseln vor Rio de Janeiro. Anzumerken ist aber auch das die Verhaltensvorschriften für Rio auf jedenfall einzuhalten sind, denn trotz aller Schönheit ist die Kriminaliät sehr hoch."
30,"“Rio wird leider überbewertet, Brasilien hat mehr zu bieten”","Man findet einfach ein günstiges Hotel an der Copacabana. Leider ist der Strand nicht das was man erwartet. Wenn man früh morgens geht ist dieser voller Müll der aus dem Meer angespült wird. Da gibt es definitiv schönere Strände in BrasilienDie Hotels im allgemeinen sind meist teuer und nicht auf dem neusten Stand.Wenn man Suhsi und Fleisch liebt ist man in Brasilien genau richtig und in Rio erst recht. Da gibt es verschiedene Sushi Restaurants in den Einkaufscenter. Sushi wieviel man will zum kleinen Preis. Für gutes Fleisch geht man am besten ins Porcao (Schwein) kostet etwas mehr aber ist besser. Achtung bei Billig Restaurants. Wenn man nur ein paar Euro fürs Fleisch zahlen muss kann es sein das man grünes oder blaues Fleisch erhält.Shopping ist nicht schlecht, es gibt mehrere grosse Einkaufscenter, aber fürs Shopping gibt es bessere Städte"
40,“zuckerhut und cocovado”,"keine stadt ist so zwiespältig wie rio:wunderbare lage, herrliche strände, blick vom zuckerhut oder noch besser vom corcovado über die bucht - all das ist ein traum!man muß einmal dort gewesen sein. -aber vorsicht:das wasser ist stark vergiftet, da auch heute noch viele abwässer ungeklärt ins meer geleitet werden! - man sieht deshalb auch niemand am schönen strand der Coppacabana ins wasser gehen!die stadt hat eine der höchsten kriminalitätsraten der welt! immer nur so viel mitnehmen, wie man tatsächlich braucht."
50,“Una città strabiliante e sportiva”,"Una città piena di vita che da ogni parte pullula di gente...tutta sorridente e attiva.. lo sport la fa da padrone.. c'è chi gioca in spiaggia a pallone, calcio-tennis,beach volley, in mare surfisti che cavalcano le onde fino al tramonto ed oltre...una lunghissima pista ciclabile costeggia la spiaggia di copacabana, ipanema ed oltre in cui persone di tutte le età fanno jogging, bicicletta, monopattino..tutti si allenano..e l'immagine che porterò sempre con me è quella di una immensa zona pedonale creata ad hoc x una maratona che impegnava tutto il lungomare di copacabana alle 13 con ben 40°!!I Brasiliani un popolo sano e sorridente!!"
50,“Rio de Janeiro”,"Die Stadt Rio ist eine der bezauberndsten Städte direkt am Ozean gelegen. Die Strände ""Copacabana"" und ""Ipanema"", der Botanische Garten mit seinem Orchideenhaus, Pao de Acucar (Zuckerhut) und die Christusstatue sind highlights dieser Stadt. Succos (frisch gepresste Obstsäfte) und die brasilianische Küche sind ein Genuss für jedermann. Einen Urlaub in dieser Stadt sollte ma am besten in einem Hotel in der ersten Reihe mit Fenster zum Atlantik an der Copacabana buchen, auch der Ausflug mit der ""Bonde"" (Straßenbahn) in die Altstadt sollte auf keinen Fall fehlen."
50,“Rio - Urlaub oder Krimi?”,"Rio de Janeiro - die vermutlich mit Abstand schönste Stadt auf dieser Welt! Von Faulenzern am Strand über Shopping-Freaks bis hin zu Kulturbegeisterten wird Rio alle Reisenden zufriedenstellen. Aber das wissen die meisten vermutlich schon. Viel wichtiger ist es, aufzuklären, was es mit der so gefürchteten Kriminalität auf sich hat, die ein Grund ist, warum sich so viele Touristen nicht für Rio de Janeiro entscheiden. Tatsächlich gibt es unleugbar viel Kriminalität in Rio. Mit ein paar Tipps sollte es trotzdem ein wunderschöner Urlaub werden!1. Wenig Bargeld mit sich führen, aber nicht zu wenig - die Menschen, die in Rio Touristen überfallen, sind selbt meist so arm, dass sie überglücklich sein werden, wenn Sie ihnen 50 Reais (ca. 20€) in die Hand drücken, und davon ablassen werden, Ihnen etwas anzutun. Sollten Sie aber keine Centavo in der Tasche haben, sieht das schon anders aus...2. ""Schlechten Viertel"" WIRKLICH meiden! Es gibt heutzutage sogar touristische Busfahrten in die sogenannten ""morros"" (Slums), davon bitte die Finger lassen!3. So viel wie möglich Portugiesisch lernen! Desto mehr man von der Sprache versteht, ja wenn man sich sogar mit anderen Leuten darin unterhalten kann, desto weniger wird man für einen Touristen gehalten und damit auch weniger überfallen (Touristen sind in den Augen der Armen immer ""superreich"").4. Und wenn doch etwas passiert: Nicht an die Polizei wenden! Die steckt meist selbst mit denen unter einer Decke. Falls zum Beispiel für eine Diebstahl-Versicherung in Deutschland ein Beweis nötig ist, dass etwas gestohlen wurde (z.B. in Form einer Anzeige), einfach im Hotel nachfragen, ein gutes Hotel (ab 4 Sterne) wird das sicher für Sie erledigen!Vielleicht klingt das jetzt sehr erschreckend, aber eine Beruhigung habe ich denoch: Mit diesen einfachen Regeln war ich bereits 9x in Rio (für jeweils mehrere Wochen) und mir ist noch kein einziges Mal etwas (ernsthaftes) passiert! Also Mut zum ersten Schritt, denn es lohnt sich!Viele Spaß in Rio!"
40,“Die schönste Grossstadt in Brasilien”,Rio de Janeiro ist eine gefährliche Schönheit.Es wird viel über Drogen und Gewalt dieser Stadt berichtet - und zurecht!Allerdings sind nicht alle Stadtteile von Rio gleich zu bewerten. So sind die schöneren Stadtteile am Ipanema Strand und an der Copacabana extrem schön und man kann seinen Aufenthalt -abgesehen von einer geboteten Vorsicht vor möglichem Taschendiebstählen - sehr geniessen.
50,“Eine Stadt zu geniessen”,"Über Rio de Janeiro wurde schon sicherlich viel geschrieben. Deswegen will ich nicht schon wieder die bekannte Sehenswürdigkeiten beschreiben sondern ein persönliches Tipp geben: in Rio läuft die Zeit langsamer und weniger ist mehr. Am besten nicht zu viel plannen und einfach die Strände (Ipanema, Copacabana, etc) und Ihre Atmosphäre geniessen. Wenn die Zeit es erlaubt vielleicht ein Fussballspiel in Maracana sehen... Und die Standards: Pao de Acucar und Cristo Redemptor. Aber wirklich laaaangsam, Die Zeit muss man richtig geniessen :-) Genauso wie die Cariocas"
50,“Wünderschön aber gefährlich”,"Rio ist ein wirklich sehr sehr schöne Stadt. Schon beim Anflug auf Rio hat man einen wunderschönen Blick auf Rio, seine grünen Hügel und die davor liegende Buchten und Inseln. Ein MUSS sind der Zuckerhut, auf den man mit zwei Seilbahnen fahren kann und noch schöner der Cocovado mit der Weltberühmten Jesus-Statue. Auch die Strände sind wunderschön. Viel Spaß hat man mit wirklich sehr starken und hohen Wellen, z.B. an der Copacabana. Vorsicht ist geboten vor überfällen. Kein Schmuck, keine Handtaschen, keine Fotoapparate an der Hand tragen. Geld in den Taschen verstauen und verteilen, so dass man, wenn man überfallen wird ein bißchen Geld geben kann und nicht alles geben muss.Tortzdem Rio ist ein Traum!!!"
50,“Rio”,Rio mit seinen Sehenswürdigkeiten ist auf jeden Fall immer wieder eine Reise wert.
50,"“Gefährlich, aber wunderschön”","Tropischer Urwald mitten in einer City, Berge bis 1022 m ü.M. fast am Strand, atemberaubende Strände wie Copacabana, Ipanema oder Leblon, an denen ähnlich zu bezeichnende Cariocas baden, Churrascarias zum Fleischessen ohne Ende, Favelas, die man besser nicht allein betritt… Rio de Janeiro ist nicht eine Reise wert. Viele Reisen!Es war nicht der Grund für meine Rio-Reise, die Favela zu besuchen, wo der kleine Junge Zeca mit seiner Gitarre die Sonne zum Aufgehen bewegte. Das war in dem Film Orpheu Negro von Marcel Camus. Auch das Mädchen aus Ipanema wollte ich nicht besuchen, von dem Sergio Mendes einst sang. Ich sollte einen Vortrag halten. Bis zu dem Tag, an dem dieser Vortrag war, wollte ich mich im Hotel verstecken, weil ich viele gruselige Geschichten über Rio gehört hatte.Es kam anders. Ich fuhr mit dem Bus vom Flughafen nach Leblon, eine weite Reise, entlang an wunderbaren Stränden mit Millionen Badenden. Da war die Angst weg. Als ich später erlebte, dass man mit einem Drachen vom Berg mitten in die Stadt gleiten kann, war ich mutig genug, den Sturz zu wagen. Aber vorher an den Strand, dann zum Corcovado und dann zum Pão de Açúcar - in dieser Reihenfolge.Eigentlich sollte man keine Bilder von Rio zeigen. Egal, wie schön die sind, können sie dem Original nicht das Wasser reichen. Deswegen die kurze Beschreibung und die Empfehlung, wenigstens ein paar Tage in Rio zu weilen. Man kann unbehelligt sogar Favelas besuchen, wenn man sich ein billiges T-shirt, supa-billich Jeans und die passenden Schuhe kauft. Vor der großen Wanderung durch Rio zuerst an der Copacabana paar Gläser choppy trinken, die Klamotten im Sand einsauen - und ab in die Stadt. Natürlich muss alles, was glitzert, im Hotel bleiben. Wer sich gar mit einer Rolex am Arm interessant machen will, findet garantiert viele Fans für die -ehemals seine - Nobeluhr."
50,“Schönste Stadt der Welt”,"Ich habe Rio de Janeiro insgesamt 3 mal besucht und ich bin wirklich begeistert von der Lage der Stadt. Wenn man sich z.B. auf einen der Hügel wie den Zuckerhut oder den Corcovado begibt, hat man eine grandiose Aussicht auf Rio, die Stadt und ihre Strände. Das Wetter ist normalerweise sehr sonnig und heiß und man kann sehr gut an den Stränden von Leblon, Ipanema und natrürlich der Cobacabana entspannen und sich durch ein Bad im Meer abkühlen. Die Strandpromenade ist auch sehr schön angelegt und sofern man etwas sportlich ist, kann man sich dort in das sportliche Treiben der Cariocas mit einmischen. Vor der Kriminalität kann man sich durch vernünftiges Verhalten und der Befolgung von einigen Grundlegen schützen, so dass man seinen Aufenthalt in dieser einzigartigen Stadt voll genießen kann."

50,“Un lugaro donde nunca podes pasarla mal”,"He visitado Rio de Janeiro mas de quince veces; ya conoczco su gente; sus calles; sus playas y sus aromas. En cuanto llegues te darás cuenta que estas en la ""Cidade Maravilhosa"". Su gente es super amable, respetuosa y cálida.Tengo amigos que conocí en mis viajes y ellos a su vez me presentaron a nuevos amigos; lo que convierte a esta ciudad en un lugar especial para mi.En Copacabana podrás ver desde feria de artesanias y pinturas (los sabados por la noches); hasta gente corriendo o andanda en bicicleta; o familias enteras pesaeando por el ""calzadão"". El fuerte de Copacabana es una visita obligada y poco conocida; allí hay una confiteria de la cual tenes la mejor vista de la Playa de Copacabana. Ipanema; un tanto más sofisticada y playas mas anchas; hay bares en la plaza; en esta misma plaza; hay y una feria de artistas (la misma pero mejorada; que esta los sabados por las noche en Copa) todos los domingo desde la mañana y hasta las 18.00 o 19.00 (siempre y cuando no llueva). Podrás ver pinturas y comidas tipicas de Brasil. Leblon; tenes el Centro de Compras; super moderno; y muchos restaurantes y cafés La pizzeria GUANABARA es un clásico; una porción con una cerveza es ideal para continuar la marcha. Más playa en La Barra; más floresta en Tijuca y Corcavado; más centro y noche en Lapa; cultura en los Museos. Y la vista mas espectacular de Río de Janerio desde el Fuerte de São Gabriel en Niteroi; previo cruce del puente de 13 km que une ambas ciudades; una en cada extrremo de la Bahía de Guanabara.Rio te ofrece todo; día; noche; cultura; diversión; pasarlo bien esta asegurado."
50,“Una settimana a Rio de Janeiro”,"Dopo anni finalmente mi sono deciso ad andare a Rio de Janeiro (periodo 4-14 marzo 2010). Periodo di piena estate e infatti per tutta la settimana abbiamo trovato temperature da 27 a 38 gradi.HO soggiornato al Crystal Palace di Arpoador (scoglio a metà tra Copacabana e Ipanema): hotel che non consiglio per prezzi elevati a fronte di servizi inefficienti e pulizia assolutamente scarsa. Ci sono soluzioni poco più care ma sicuramente più comode. (l'hotel è qualificato come 4 stelle, ma corrisponde ad un nostro 2 stelle).NOn ho avuto la percezione di una città violenta, ma sono stato abbastanza attento a evitare le favelas e soprattutto a non soffermarmi in spiaggia di notte.per il resto RIo è meravigliosa: paesaggi, clima, gente...tutto bellissimo: un paradiso. Da vedere assolutamente il Corcovado con la statua del Cristo, il Pan di Zucchero e il giardino botanico.Consiglio al mattino di andare a correre a Copacabana: il jogging è un rito egualitario per i brasiliani, a cui partecipano tutti, senza alcuna differenza di razza, etnia, condizioni economiche.Provate i succhi tropicali in uno dei tanti bar di ipanema:sono buonissimi. Mangiate alle ""Churrascherie a Kilo"" che si trovano in tutta copacabana: ottimo anche il sushi e a prezzi assolutamente competititvi (5 euro per un piatto enorme).Evitate assolutamente il ristorante Marios alla fine di Copacabana. E' un posto turistico e assolutamente di basso profilo. Antipasti pieni d'olio e crostacei che puzzavano di ammoniaca. Prezzi elevatissimi per Rio (ho pagato sugli 80 euro e ho mangiato del cibo davvero mediocre)."

La limpieza de los cuartos es regular, la piscina en la terraza es pequeña (el agua está siempre turbia) y no tiene suficientes reposeras.

Io rispettando queste banali regole ed evitando di andare nei posti sconosciuti di notte, non ho avuto nessuna brutta esperienza!!Noi europei personalmente abbiamo tante cose da apprendere da loro, ma quella personalmente che io ho avuto piu´a cuore e´ la loro disponibilita´ ed il sorriso, presente nel 99% delle persone incontrate.Disponibilita´e sorriso, senza alcun rientro, x il gusto di vivere e lasciar vivere. Per non parlare poi delle bellezze naturalistiche, vi lasciano senza fiato!ah dimenticavo, si vi offrono di visitare le favelas, vi prego un consiglio, evitate di andarci, ma non xche´e e´pericoloso (non lo e´in questo caso, xche´siete accompagnati da una guida locale); la cosa che non ho gradito, e´la speculazione che le agenzie turistiche locali fanno sulle persone piu´disagiate, facendosi pagare dal turista profumatamente e mostrando allo stesso la poverta´in cui centinaia di migliaia di persone vivono in modo scadente.
