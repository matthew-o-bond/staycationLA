30,Those sunken eyes...,"It’s an interesting bust but presents Dean more as a zombie than a heartthrob. The location is good for photo of it with the Hollywood sign in the background, although there are usually people surrounding the statue.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrdom
30,At the Griffith Observatory,"Immortalising James Dean in front of the Hollywood sign from afar is this monument. Found in front of the Griffith Observatory, it pays homage to his characters visit to the area in ‘Rebel Without a Cause’. Nice backdrop of the hillside trails behind the statue.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gkw09
30,Good spot to see the HOLLYWOOD sign,The memorial is definitely not a 'must do' on your L.A. tour - unless you are a big fan of James Dean. But from the here you have a perfect view on the HOLLYWOOD sign an a marvellous views on L.A. and Santa Monica skylines. Furthermore it's right next to the conservatory which you may find interesting. Parking is at $4 per hour.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WolframKarbid
