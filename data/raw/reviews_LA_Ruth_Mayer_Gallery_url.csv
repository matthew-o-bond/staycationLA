50,Great Gallery but it is no longer there,For years I have been visiting the Ruth Mayer Gallery on our annual visit to Catalina.....But on this visit in June 2019 I found the Gallery gone replaced by another Beach clothing establishment.....Will miss my annual visits to the Gallery. A very unique Gallery featuring a very talented and creative artist.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S215EKjamesc
50,Eclectic gallery,The wide range of subjects made my visit to Ruth Mayer Gallery a real treat. I really enjoyed seeing recent and vintage paintings.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SMOgal
40,Religious Inspired Art Gallery,"We visited with friends, who have Ruth Mayer art in their home. Nice gallery leaving visitors free to view without pressure. Many Ruth Mayer pieces having a religious theme, including beautiful paintings of the Pope in a collage design. Definitely worth a visit to view beautiful, bright and colorful art.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RikiUSA
50,Seeing the world thru Ruth's eyes,If you have the opportunity to go into Ruth's gallery you're in for a treat. Amazing pictures thru a very talented artists eyes!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I8470IDdonnab
10,Not Recommended .,"We visited the Ruth Mayer Gallery and met Ruth Personally.My Husband instantly hit it off with Ruth and he gave her a deposit on a painting.Ruth Mayer and my husband had an instant spiritual connection and he decided to donate over $200 in skateboarding product to her ""South American adopted children"" months later my husband became ill and we asked for a return of the deposit. In California there is no such thing as a nonrefundable deposit legally so we had no problems asking Ruth Mayer for our deposit back. And since her and my husband had become seemingly close and we had become her a parent friend we expected the money back with no hesitation. We have now had to seek legal support and they are still not giving us any of our money back. This may not be a gallery that you want to visit on your trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/473kurtisb
50,Do not miss out on her incredible talent.,"Ruth Mayer is a truly gifted artist and has recently been artist of the year. This art gallery is completely dedicated to her paintings, and there are quite a lot of them. Her use of vibrant colors and a variety of styles and themes will appeal to a broad audience of contemporary art lovers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/whyitripped
40,her work is amazing!,gad we stopped in and spent some time admiring her work. Would love to be able to own a piece or to. Displayed for your viewing pleasure.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jano684
50,"Aaazing artist, amazing gallery","I've seen her work for years in her Laguna Beach gallery and on Catalina. She is uniquely gifted, and her work is world-renowned. Even if you're not buying anything, this is a must-see exhibition (operated by her son, BTW.) Some very affordable, unique Catalina souvenirs too... from coasters to mouse pads and beautiful prints on slate... much better than most kitchy stuff on the main drag.Must-see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/229jodye
30,Ruth Mayer pictures over the top,If her son tours you through the gallery....it is spooky !She paints many pictures of her ghostly half hidden face in many paintings. A big one of Manhattan shows the arms of an angel supposedly over the Twin Towers. If this was true they would not have fallen. Great technique but not worth buying,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmosAmos1
30,Great for art lovers,I enjoy coming into the Ruth Mayer Gallery when I am on the island. There is a lot of beautiful art and there aren't sales people to mess with. I truly enjoy the artwork but it is very expensive as is most art. Definitely worth it for people who love the island and want some fine art but I enjoy just looking around because I'm cheap. There's no denying that she is a talented artist.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/skylarlisa6899
30,"She is extreamly talented, if you like Thomas Kincade paintings you will LOVE Ruth Mayer's art.","So very talented, wish I was as talented as she is...She paints in glowing colors. I'm more of an old world type of painting person. Not so much of a glowing artist, when you turn the lights down the painting comes alive...quite amazing really",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/859annj
40,Single Artist Gallery,"This place offered a taste of Catalina Island culture. The artist whose work is displayed here obviously loves where she lives. Fun, bright colors in paintings with a variety of scenes around the island.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RabbiWendy
50,If you go in you will spend money,We have bought several pieces throughout the years and always visit her galleries to see what is new.Look at her painting of the twin towers. Chillikng,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bobtheburglar
30,"Ruth's Art is Amazing, but EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE","We were treated courteously and loved the beautiful art, but it was clear right away that we were way outside of our budget. Ruth has a rare talent, but I wish at least small prints of some of her works were available to fans that cannot afford hundreds and thousands of dollars for a single, small piece.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Meg2LD
