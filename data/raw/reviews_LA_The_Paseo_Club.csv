50,"A Comprehensive Fitness/Social Club, Not A Gym","If you're looking for Gold's or LA Fitness you need not join. Over the course of the last 20? years I have belonged to the Spectrum, LA Fitness, Gold's Gym, the Henry Mayo Fitness Center (same Spectrum location) and now Paseo (for the past 2+ years). Most important - understand what you want with an out-of-home exercise facility.I started out with just the Health Club at Paseo (not tennis) just to get a feel for the culture and environment. Paseo is a club, not a gym with a fitness center, tennis & swim classes, an eatery, bar (under renovation), 14 tennis courts, pickleball and other amenities (including a tennis shop). Paseo is a lifestyle environment. It costs more than the local gym environments because it's more than a sweat shop (not that they are lesser facilities - just different if that's what you like). You can exercise, go for a swim, have a bite to eat (or libation) and hit the sauna or steam room.The staff is congenial and know you by name. They (exercise and tennis) are experts in understanding what your body needs and explain how to improve upon it without being pushy. It's your body and you can ""extend"" as much as you want. Swimming is comprehensive for kids, adults and seniors. They just resurfaced the pool and looks great.All in all - it's the best overall exercise/social facility in town. that's open for those with regular or crazy hours. I thoroughly enjoy it and recommend highly.",Eric G
