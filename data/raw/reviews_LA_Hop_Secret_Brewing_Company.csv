40,Support Local Brewers!,"Owner and brewer Gary just opened Hop Secret two months ago! Tucked away near the Monrovia Gold Line Station, it takes a little effort to find, but the entrance is well marked. You can actually enter from both ends of the taproom. There is a bar with about 8-10 stools and a seating area with chairs and a sofa; all in full view of the Brewing tanks and assorted apparatus. Hop Secret appears to currently brew traditional and classic beer styles such as IPA's, Lagers, Stouts, and Hefeweizen. Serving sizes include a full pour ($6) half pour ($4), and tasters for $2.50. Despite alimited assortment of beer styles, it is evident that Gary's brewing focus produces some very drinkable and memorable beer. For my taste, I was particularly pleased with the IPA 002 with Warrior, Citra, Mosaic, El Dorado hops.",Keystone_Traveler
40,Worth a Sip!,"New micro brewery worthy of a visit. Small, not easy to find but so what! The owner was great, super friendly and humble.. But it is the beer that will bring you back. The lager was solid and delicious! This place is well worth the visit!",Keith L
