40,Cool chill and spacious with a sick view outside,Cool brewery to hang out just wish the bartender was a little bit more happy to be there.We went on a Thursday night and there was a dog and a kid so I'm assuming it's kid and dog friendly. Yay.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melindaescobar
40,Great hang out spot,"Came here on a early Friday afternoon and caught a great spot at an outside table.We ordered a few flights of beer and were not disappointed. Pretty standard with light, IPA and some interesting saison and wine beers ( didn’t try those -next time)I enjoyed the crowds that came in and out and people picking up beer to go. Cool vibe and good people watching.Their burger was dynamite ! It’s a must order.I would imagine this would be a great spot before or after a Dodger game.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bumble-Brig
50,Beer lovers unite,What an awesome place to hang out with friends just outside of Chinatown. They have a great variety of beers at good prices and some stuff that's overpriced. It can very busy on the weekends like anywhere else. They need more staff to handle the crowds and to clean up the tables quicker.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Creeping_Death_LA
50,Fun spot to hang,"Grab a drink, find a spot, chill out with friends. Fun space to just hang out in - lots of seating available throughout, including outdoor patio seating. Animals are welcome on the patio but only service animals inside. Parking is available in the front lot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/imskimmy
50,Friendly with nice atmosphere,"Just a little walk along a main road from Chinatown metro, we loved this place. Basically a bar serving home brewed beer, with snacks. A large and airy building, with a sports area at the rear and some tables outside in the fresh air. Helpful, staff really knew the beers on offer. The menu is a small selection of snack type meals, we ordered two to share and found them more than enough; nicely presented and tasty.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Loz97
50,Great find!,"We’re from out of town and were looking for a place to get a beer and a bite before a Dodgers game. What a great place!! Open and inviting, kid and dog friendly, with a large patio. We had a variety of beers, festbier, porter, hazy IPAs and west coast IPAs, all really, really good. Good job folks!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Micah214
50,Great new Location -- Brewery listed in the Top for USA,"The day before I had visited Hermosillo and wanted to try the “new” Chinatown spot. Glad I did. What a fun spot. Nice clean décor. New clean bathrooms, spotless brewery. Comfortable seating. Friendly bartenders. Large space. No air conditioning, so it gets warm inside. Strong line up of really good beers. Sours were a real hit. Try the Sun-Soaked Cherry Berliner Weisse – it is a really good beer for a warm summer day. The guest beer Saison 300 also worth trying. Plenty of parking on the street near by.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RussellJW
