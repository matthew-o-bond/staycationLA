40,Santa Monica Beach,Stayed in Venice Beach for 11 days and only ventured as far as Santa Monica one day where we cycled and did the pier. Santa Monica is more built up with higher end shops and restaurants than Venice but Venice beach has more charm and character. Santa Monica beach is very busy around the pier area but quieter further out either side with deep and vast stretches of beach to use. To the left of the pier is an open gym with bars and rings and the right of the pier has a number of volleyball courts.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GBItineraries
30,"Nice place, beautiful view","The platform itself is very commercialized and the theme park is crowded and unnecessary.Nice to see, feel the sea but nothing more. In the summer you can't move thereWorth a short visit only",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ronnyserfaty
40,Day At The Beach,I went bike riding with a friend and had such an amazing time. The fresh air and energy of the ocean was just what I needed.

The landscape was so different than when I had visited a few years prior.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/642marlam
50,Santa Monica Beach & Pier,"Nice beach, clean, water clear, a bit chilly but that's the Pacific Ocean normal. Much better beaches than the East coast and they are FREE unlike NJ.

50,A wonderful attack on the senses!,"Santa Monica was amazing and is so full of life it risks sensory overload.The pier is vibrant and busy with the scent of sugar, fried foods and salty air. The colours of the stalls and Pacific park rides mixed with the white sand of the beach and blue sky makes a stunning backdrop and a great place to people watch.The town has a wide range of shops to suit all tastes and a good range of restaurants and cafes. On each corner there is some kind of performance - singers, musicians, dancers from the very young to the very old and you can’t help but smile as you walk past - a crazy kinda place and wellWorth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/500kerryr

I loved the view while sitting on the beach, the ocean in front, the huge beach area surrounding, the mountains to the northwest, it was so peaceful. The waves crashing were not loud like many beaches I've been to. It got more crowded as the day went on, but not horrible for a Saturday. The weather was a beautiful 70 with full sun. We made a judgement error and didn't put sunscreen on right away, thinking we could get a bit of sun without burning since it wasn't hot, and all 7 of us got sunburned. It was still the most peaceful and relaxing day of our week-long vacation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnsGirl87

50,"Amazing place, a must do","We took the metro from Hollywood to Santa Monica Pier, it's a 45 minute ride but worth it. Pier is fun, extortionate prices of course, but the bay is breath taking. Lots of gym apparatus on the sand, beautiful Shutters on the Beach hotel for a drink, street artists, plenty of bike riding and skateboarding - great vibe.

50,Iconic California Beach Experience,"The Bay includes several beaches, each with it's own character and pleasures, and we love them all. You can't miss the Santa Monica Pier and the beach. It's awesome for running, biking, skating, strollering, and even walking. You can saunter on the pier and people watch or ride the classic fair rides for a scream. If you're there on a cloudy day, it might be quieter and a jazz man will play a solo on his saxophone just for you, with the crashing surf as an accompaniment. You can play or watch beach volleyball, soccer, or flag football, or stretch it out with a beachside yoga class. We love Saturday mornings there, when it's a less crowded, but it's pretty amazing anytime.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PasadenaJane

The main street is immaculate, with a laid back cool vibe, plenty of places to sit back and people watch.pairEvery major store you could think of, with plenty of bargains to be had.A place I highly recommend for a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Foster1965
30,Not very clean,Went to Santa Monica beach in April and it was crowded and also not very well maintained as compared to any European beach. Looking at the amount of tourist they receive they should provide more clean with added service. Little bit disappointed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Traveller_00727
40,Very Scenic and Beautiful,While hanging out at the Santa Monica Pier we strolled the beach and rode bikes down to Venice beach with my family of 4. it was so pretty and amazing to see.

40,Wide beach with easy access from the town centre,"Well worth the stroll along the pathways running both north and south.

30,Better Off at Other Beaches,"Los Angeles has at least 15 beaches in the county of L.A. and double that if not more when you include Orange County to the South and Ventura County to the North. You're better off at most of those other beaches. Like Venice Beach, Santa Monica Bay and its beaches are vastly overrated. They're famous for being famous but in reality they're crowded with tourists and locals who don't bother to do their homework to find other beaches that are better for an authentic, uncrowded experience. Save the money you will spend on parking and head to another beach that you can park at for free on the side of the road. Do a little digging, and those are easy enough to find in the greater L.A. area. Better yet, support the state and national park system by going to one of their beaches in the greater L.A. area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KirstenAlana

50,Pleasant surprise,"I had no idea what the view was like from Santa Monica Pier until my wife and I visited a couple of weeks ago. We even rode the Ferris wheel! The view was breathtaking. Clean beautiful beaches in both directions. Nice attractions. Very suitable for children. Enjoyed watching the old fishermen fishing off the end of the Pier. Even though we were on a tour parking was very congested. I would not have wanted to try parking in those very small parking spaces myself. Great time, great tour. Certainly enjoyed it more than our next stop at Venice Beach!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/prn13norm
50,Miles and Miles of Gorgeous,"Make sure you have all of the time you need to soak in Santa Monica (and associated) Beaches.

30,Great Day at the Beach,Santa Monica Pier is about a 45 minute train ride from downtown LA on the Expo line.

And the views were amazing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LadyN516

50,One of my favorite beaches.,"I love the restaurants, the amusement park and the water. I’ve been coming here for over 20 years. Its improved over the years and there are more stores.

30,Santa Monica Bay,A bit disappointing the carnival wasn’t opened. Check before you go there for carnival opening times.Only souvenirs on the boardwalk. A few place to buy food. You can hire a bike and ride along the promenade.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lipptylou
50,So much to do in this beautiful area of L.A.!,"This area is a favorite for our family and our first stop to bring our out-of-town guests.

50,Fantastic Sunset View,"Made a trip to Santa Monica Shopping Centre to park our car.Walked around and had late lunch. Walked to the Pier at Santa Monica Beach.

Everyone were excited and some clapped with joy!Very pleased with the long wait.Rember to find a cheaper carpark as we paid USD$18 for about 5 hrs or less.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/13parism
50,"Santa Monica, promenade area","Lots of foreign tourists come to Santa Monica which makes it fun, reminds me of when I backpacked through Europe. We have one of the best hostels here, no age limit, great shopping and strolling, the scooters are a blast, I ride them everywhere! Fantastic restaurants down by the pier, and it's also an easy bike ride, scooter ride, or Uber to Main street on the way to Venice. Some of the best hotel chains in the world also! A lot to do, including four movie theaters, but people watching and entertainment on the promenade is free and always fun. In the summer you can add the beach!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/craigcB8124TN

50,"Always different, always great","The bay is one of my favourite places on Earth. It is always interesting, always beautiful and always different. I have been here in winter with gale force winds, in the summer heat and in early September which is probably my favourite time to visit. I love walking along the boardwalk all the way from Santa Monica Pier to Venice Pier taking in the weird and wonderful people who live and visit here. Early mornings are the best time to do this. The local street vendors are setting up their imaginative street stalls and wares, the first fitness fanatics are out and it is still pretty empty if tourists. It is a bit over 10k from Pier to Pier and back. If you start at Santa Monica Pier then Cow’s End is a good place to grab an early coffee at the half-way point. Evening walks have their own splendour with amazing sunsets and an unexpected quietness. Here you are with a multi-million people city at your back and it is quiet. Just waves, seagulls and a subtle buzz.The other ways to explore Santa Monica Bay are obviously on a bike, hire scooter or on rollerblades. Take a walk or a ride but do take it, it’s worth it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ntalabany
50,A Walk on the Beach is Well Worth It!,"The beach can get crowded during the summer and especially on the weekends, because it is popular with locals. Getting away from the fast-pace of Los Angeles, it is the ideal place to walk along the beach (solo, couples and families) in a more relaxed state of being.Parking at the beach or on the pier.Eateries available on the pier and along the walkway at the base of the pier/beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VacationerCritic
50,The best local area beach,"Santa Monica beach is our favorite beach for a nice sunny day. It tends to get crowded during the summer but if you go early on a Sunday, you’ll get great cheap parking and have a fantastic day. Lifeguards are around and if yo fancy a swim, the best time is Sept or Oct when the water is warm. Waves can be wild though. Lots of food options around. Great place to visit. Quieter than Venice beach but better experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sunandac2016
30,"Not Bad for kids, but fairly down market",The Pier is at a beautiful location. The fair is quite ok for going with kids who will enjoy the rides. All day ticket passes are reasonable at about 18 dollars for a kid. Certainly the fair looks rather aged and could use a face lift. Usual fair food is scarce and I inviting. Best for kids and young teenagers.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rafiaster
50,Great Beach,We stopped here several times while in Santa Monica. The beach area is very clean and welcoming. We had a chance to test the waters of the Pacific. Even on a crowded day there is plenty of room to walk along the beach and enjoy the sound of the waves.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/448bobc
40,A nice relaxing beach!,"The beach is really nice. We were there in a sunny day and it was gorgeous. The parking is OK but it would be paid (~$10). Renting bikes was a really nice experience with the kids. There's a special trail for bikes and it was parallel to the beach. Overall, it's a nice place to spend a day or so.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/louieUS
40,Such a contrast to the rest of L.A.,"Even if you can't swim in April when I visit, this is still a go-to place. It can be crowded, but can't be compared to the freeways and downtown, find it pleasant and relaxing and the sunsets are superb. Good for walking on the sandy beach or the footpath.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RonWamberal
30,Good beach,The beach is okay but not the best ive seen. It is very famous but there are better beaches in my opinion even near los angeles.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pepper159
50,Gorgeous place,This has to be one of the most beautiful places in LA - watch a pacific sunset and you will be hooked for life. So much to see and do in Santa Monica.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rose21
40,Absolutely Worth To Visit,"Despite it is always busy and full of people, this place is worth to visit. You can park your car at the designated parking spots or park at the multi-storeys car park nearby. We have chosen one that is free for the first 90 mins and then walked out to the pier. The pier is an ocean park with scenery, restaurants and shopping spot. The Pacific Park has offered fun to family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hongkongboy55
50,Clear & Sunny,"I ride my bike along the bike path from Marina del Rey to the foot of Palos Verdes. When it is clear and sunny Catalina is visible in the distance. Activity along the beach whether people are walking their dogs, running, people playing volley ball or surfers all add to the energy of the experience including other cyclists. It is different from day to day like after a storm the waves are strong and powerful preventing many of the surfing set to stay out of the water. ""On a clear day one can see forever.""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sni2015
40,Stunning Place!,On a 3 week family holiday. We didn't plan on visiting Santa Monica. Boy am I glad we did. Great vibe. Pier is great. Great town centre too. Well worth a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/m4slcsam

Chose to bypass the Pier 4 the canals of Venice & hit downtown for free surround views of the city of LA fr atop City Hall, Art Walk, & dinner.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vacation570351
40,This was the highlight of my trip to LA,"Short review:I walked from the Santa Monica peer to Marina beach. Overall, was pretty enjoyable if you have about half a day to a day to burn around this area. The traffic is insane but once you are there, you should be good to get food, shade, a place to rest or just lay down. The peer is the main attraction but the beach is super convenient. Get your swimmers out and enjoy some of the water.Longer a bit more detailed:I am glad I had a stopover of several hours, enough for me to take an uber and come to Santa Monica to kill some time, otherwise my impression of LA would've been pretty negative. I say this not as an insult to people living there or anything, I just didn't find anything attractive about LA as it reminded me to a huge parking lot.Leaving my whining aside, as I knew I was going to be spending several hours in LA, I asked a few friends and all of them recommended me to stop by Santa Monica. Getting there was horrible, the traffic moves incredibly slow and I was about to request the uber driver to take me back to the airport. Fortunately, he told me ""the peer is close by, you can get out here and walk the rest so you are not bored here"".Few minutes later, I was on the peer and I started to feel a bit more relax. You will find several shops, food, the carnival and lots of different attractions around. I walked towards the carnival first as it is quite emblematic. Not having a picture of the place would've been a crime. While in there, stopped for a burger and the super over sized drinks and chips (french fries?)...Honestly Americans, why do you need to add 3 and a half kilos (7 pounds) of sauce to a burger? Obviously, that is an hyperbole but it did not matter where I had bitten, the result would've been the same: a splash of sauce flying away from the burger (thankful it flew towards some lady sitting nearby... followed by 2 million apologies from my part, but getting in the plane with grease would've been nice).In any case, from the peer, you should be able to walk south: initially close to the beach (which is nothing special when compared to the ones we have in Australia) then closer to the shops. In general, I liked it quite a lot.A few hours into my visit, I was engaged by a few ladies and a bloke asking me where I was from. Didn't want to enter into too much polemic, so replied that I was from South America which none of them believed. After a bit, told them I was from Australia and they took it in without issues. They just wanted to sell me stuff which I declined, but all of them started asking me about all the dangerous animals we have down under... sigh, here we go again. The reason why I am telling you this is, they recommended me to by the Venice Beach Boardwalk which was pretty entertaining.All in all, I must say my stay (whether short or long) was enjoyable, making it the entire highlight of my trip to LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rodrigoelp
40,Nice 2 hour visit.,"Booked the hop on hop off tour bus and one of the routes took us to Santa Monica and the beach. Pacific Park is a good place for families with kids, the ferris wheel, roller coaster, restaurants and cafes with street entertainers on the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Homejames63
50,Very best of many things,"I cannot say one thing negative about this area. I started by taking the Red/purple line from Union Station and transfer to the Expo Line which has the last stop in Santa Monica. From that point on do what you like Shop, take a Walk on the Pier, Walk, Ride the Farris Wheel, Walk, Fish, Walk, Swim, Walk, Eat. My pick is Bubba Gump Shrimp Company. Then WALK it off and go down to the Beach and Walk to the Venice Beach Area. Numerous bike rentals along the way, Do your home work prices for rentals do very a lot. Venice Beach is just a great place. By the way one of the most cleanest area in the LA. Their small Garbage Trucks appear to have all have Wax Jobs, not kidding.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cbq12018
50,"Great day out.. with kids, family or friends","Santa Monica Bay is fabulous.. there is something for everyone.. a visit to the pier either Santa Monica or Venice Pier, although there is more to do on Santa Monica pier.. you can eat, fish, watch the surfers or walk along the beach or walkway all the way to Venice.. great swimming.. and/or great sights, you can either swim on the beach or people watch at muscle beach, you can hire a bike, have a beer.. take a picnic or just watch the sunset.. a must!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J4382UScarolineg

50,Gorgeous,"This is a place to visit if you are in Los Angeles. If you go early in the morning, you might get some fog and it might be a bit nippy depending on where you live. The water could be really cold. There is a boardwalk for those people who don't want sand in their shoes and you an also walk on the sand. If you are really lucky, you might be able to see dolphins and/or whales. The beach is almost empty until about 10:30 or 11 am, after that, there are more people coming to enjoy the cool weather. So if you like it quiet, go early, walk all the way south to Venice and come back to your car. Or head up walking towards the north, the beach/sand is very walkable in this part. You can park in the short term parking lot for 2 hours and pay only 2 dollars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/63beatrizm2015

40,The Part of Santa Monica People tend to Miss: Will Rogers State Beach,"Everyone's excited to go to the touristy and rather crowded pier and that's nice but if you want enjoy a more natural experience.

30,Nice walk,"We visited the beach on our last trip to LA, it was a nice walk but not all that it is hyped up to be. The restaurants are good and so is the shopping, the pier is very busy and hard to get around with the amount of people that gather there. The carnival on the pier was very expensive.If you have some time to kill then visit the Pier at Santa Monica.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lynkev2016
40,Family time,"Out for a nice day at the beach, my family and I usually park near the 3rd street Promenade , which makes it easier for us to visit both locations, it’s only a ten minute walk to the sand and a 5 min walk to all the stores at the promenade . It is totally worth the no headache you’ll get waiting in the congested 10 fwy . DO NOT TAKE THE FREEWAY TILL IT ENDS , get off on Lincoln make a right and park on 3rd street . Trust me you’ll save and hour of driving and looking for pier parking “ not worth it “ park on top and save Time and Money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maguirre0605

I didn't enjoyed it at all ..not recommended,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/47seemag
40,Nice beaches and a pleasant day out,We only visited for the day because we were staying north of the city but it was pleasantly warm and a good day out.There are just LOADS of T-shirt and momento stores there but also a few restaurants. There is also the pier of course so therewas plenty to keep us occupied.I'm not sure if I would go there again since there are so many beaches around there just doesn't seem any point in going to the same one repeatedly unless you are a local.Worth a visit though.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GBPete

40,CROWDED!,"Look, it's the Baywatch beach -- the iconic beach experience. It has a nice sidewalk out to the sand and it is near restaurants and whatnot, so it's convenient. But with convenience comes CROWDS. So don't expect to have the beach to yourself. It will be yourself and 8,000 other people. Just know that going in. If you want a quieter experience, Google some Malibu beaches. There are some ""secret"" beaches that are WAY less crowded and probably nicer...but they aren't the Baywatch beach. So pick your poison.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/751theresav

This place is really expensive shopping and its really into itself!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Erudite_journey
40,Waded in the water.,Lovely to spend a hot day by the water. The city needs to ensure that the water fountains work and that there are taps to wash the sand off the feet once one leaves the beach. Lots of interesting vendors some nice places to eat and drink. Enjoyable.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/184pb
50,Santa Monica has so much to do!,"This is just one of the many things to do in Santa Monica so make sure you do your research to see what the locals do here. My best advice is to park, if you drove, at the public parking lot and walk to the Santa Monica Pier. Restaurants & Rides, even an Aquarium. You can rent bikes or roller skates near the steps at the bottom of the pier. Beautiful ocean breezes blow constantly as you walk along the bay. The Santa Monica mountains can be seen as you are looking in the same direction as Malibu. If you don’t have time to stay the day, you can park on the Santa Monica Pier also unless it’s full, just follow the signs. Check out my restaurant review on the first on the restaurant on the left on the pier. It’s delicious. I say go early in the day, or by noon to get the best parking. Check the hours of each place to eat. I believe we arrived around 11am. Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cindysmotherman

40,Iconic Southern California,"I was born and raised in West Los Angeles and Santa Monica Bay is the place that defines our summers. It is not a pristine beach , but the sands are expansive, The pier is worth a look and visit the old fashioned merry go round. Have a hot dog on the stick and enjoy the boardwalk. People watch.

It was very busy but quite an exciting place with plenty of things to do in the fairground (Pacific Park). Its free to go in and look around. You can look back towards the shore and its pretty!We then spent some time on the beach and in the sea which was lovely.

That said, we have one heck of a beach here (and coupled with the Pier - it is pretty much unsurpassed.) There is so much to do. So much to see. So many amenities. So much people watching - that for even a native it can be really invigorating and quite exciting. I suggest you rent a bike and ride along the Pacific Coast Bike Path. Have a meal and a drink on the Pier. Mariasol serves a pretty good meal and a pretty great margarita.

40,Santa Monica was a nice place to visit,"We got the metro from LA which was about an hour... you hop of the metro straight into the main town. There are lots of cafes, restaurants, bars and shops here in the town area. As you head towards the beach and the pier it is only a short walk away. The beach is lovely with white sands, there was at the time a memorial to soldiers who were committing suicide from PTSD which was very sad. The pier has the normal types of attractions with arcades and rides- you can buy a day ticket.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travellerm68
50,Beautiful Day on white sandy beaches!,"Lots of interesting people, foods, treats, smells and sounds! From tourist things to just a beautiful beach with waves rolling in, I highly recommend stopping game by!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SummerR705
50,Beautiful and best viewed from the Pier.,We could have spent a whole day just taking in the sights here. It was a beautiful historical place and we are so glad we visited.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P2554HSsamh
50,Beach was great to recharge,"The beach was almost vacant and it was fabulous. The wind, the gulls, the ocean smell, were all perfect. Beach was totally clean.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A6368YRrobertb
40,Pacific pearl,An excellent place to escape the grimy streets of Hollywood. The Pacific becomes a playground for the rich and famous...plus the rest of us. Worth a ride down the boulevard of broken dreams.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bryanedwin
50,Santa Monica Bay offers the Best Fun.,"Take a day and go to Santa Monica beach in the morning and enjoy a swim and some sun. Lunch can be at wonderful restaurants and cafes along the boardwalk. Then go to the PIER and look at the characters that play music and sing, and feel welcomed by big smiles from beautiful people. Behind the bay is the mall full of terrific boutiques and cafes and at the end of the day enjoy a cocktail as the sun sets. Santa Monica Bay..... will give you your best day! Janice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Janice86
50,Love!,"Spent so much time here, just walking up and down from Venice to Santa Monica and back... I love watching people walk their dogs, couples in love, friends hanging together, people doing acrobatics, fitness and different kinds of sport. It's beautiful and windy, the sun shines bright and you just know that life is good, and all is well. Positive vibes here!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/speedbunny
40,"Highly Recommended,","Enjoyed spending time around the pear and the bay several times during our vacation in the area. Weather early in the morning, during the day or into the evening . It is a really nice place to spend the time as a couple or family. The walk paths along the beach, bike paths are a great way to enjoy the area and people-watch :-). Recommend taking the time to enjoy it well, all the area from the Santa Monica Pier down through Venice beach into Marina Del Ray area",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrynjarOrn61
50,Beautiful beaches and beautiful people,"What a lovely day out, spending time in the shops and restaurants, and ofcourse the Pier! Beautiful beaches and beautiful people, this is a MUST if visiting LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bronwenremke
40,Santa Monica,A popular beach and promenade. Beachside you can easily walk down to Venice Beach and the Palisade cliff top walk gives a different perspective. The pier is also an highlight of the area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AndyM1973
50,MORE THAN JUST A GREAT BEACH,If come to see Santa Monica beach you will find so much more. The beach itself it a great place to spend the day. Of course there is the famous pier with food and shops plus rides so something for the whole family. After visiting the area if you have any energy just walk a couple blocks inland to the 3rd Street Promenade. Shops and restaurant all in a wonderful atmosphere of SoCal. One note if you have never been to the area it can get cool. I brought friends visiting from Pennsylvania and had secretly placed sweatshirts in the trunk. They used everyone of them. To me it is the best of both worlds.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sportsmaven
50,"One Word ""FUN""",I highly recommend this beach. The water is already very warm and clean from April. The beach is well maintained and has a very large and inexpensive parking. The people on the beach are very nice and friendly. You can also borrow a bike very cheap and drive it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cod615
40,Fun.,"Visited here as oart of a tour operated by AMG Coaches and Tours of Anaheim. The pier was a fun place with plenty going on. We were amazed to see parking for vehicles actually on the pier, nothing like that in the U.K. The beach was superb and all in all it was well worth stopping here on the tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelcD1193IP
40,Bucket list visit,Always seen the landscape shots with my old favorite late night show and want to make sure I went there at least once. Only draw back is the parking situation and the cost too. This is where I was introduced to the new thing with renting Bird electric scooters. They’re everywhere!!The people on the bike path are a little agressive even for an adult with fearing of getting clipped and runner over. Let alone with small children.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/flynford
50,Go in August,"I grew up going to Santa Monica Beach. It was a family friendly beach then and it still is. There are no rocks and the sand slopes slowly into the ocean. With the boardwalk and pier always within walking distance, there are plenty of food and entertainment choices. The biggest mistake tourists make is coming in June or early July; this is when it is often overcast and the water is still cold. Late July through early September are definitely the premium months. Additionally, if it is possible, avoid the weekends when the locals are off and head to the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tomsaint11
50,crowded but a must see,beautiful. a lot going on there- good shops and beautiful shoreline and beach. everyone is carefree here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/inlove13

50,Whatever You Want,"Santa Monica offers something for everyone. If you have kids, the pier is the place with rides and lots of fun people watching. And there is a large choice of eating places, whether you want sit down in a restaurant or walk around. The beach goes forever and you can walk, swim, play volleyball, whatever suits you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lindabC8321HK
40,"Busy, but worth a visit","The beach here is great. Very deep and no shortage of space. It is busy, but worth a visit to relax and take in some sun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iliketravel99
50,Everything except the prestense,"Santa Monica is a fairly large area although the streets along the beach front are thought of as the real Santa Monica. If you are travelling to Los Angeles as a stop over or a brief visit, Santa Monica has it all. Comfortable hotels in all price ranges, great places to eat and good shopping. If one is really wanting to venture into LA, a bus will get you to Beverly Hills in 20 minutes or Uber is extremely convenient in a city where everyone drives and few take public transport.The beach comes into its own in the afternoon where entertainment such as people watching is free. Muscle Beach aptly named with all the body builders flexing muscles, would be gymnasts and tight rope walkers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G9630WKdavidk
50,Lovely shopping and beautiful beach and pier,Spent a lovely few hours in Santa Monica. Great for shopping and eateries. Then there is the beach and pier. Would happily go there again.Quite a few homeless people coming up to people and begging which was a little uncomfortable,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lizmac2003
50,Santa Monica,"WE caught the No 3 big blue bus to Santa Monica, $1.25 one way, what a bargain, we did it last time 4 years ago, and felt more comfortable this time. Had a beautiful lunch at a restaurant down there, wandered around looking at the sights,up and down the esplanade, and saw many more things than last time. The caught the bus back to our hotel",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jkdonnon
40,Great beach,"Huge beach. Pier is OK, gets very busy. Good to walk along the back of the beach down through muscle beach to venice beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AndrewKen
40,Nice Beaches,The beaches are clean- The water is cold up until August........There are bathrooms available fairly in close proximity to the sand. This is a family beach with all types of people. I bring a blanket-towel -lunch- and meet my friends at the beach from noon-4 P.M. No complaints....and you can walk the boardwalk all the way to Venice beach.....,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/markclewis

50,No One Can Match Our Creator's Talents,Walking along Venice Beach all the way to Santa Monica pier is astounding. The simple serenity of the waves splashing along the beach is breath-taking. No wonder people can find themselves at places like the beach as it is easy to get lost in nature.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/999jimw
50,iconic beach,"have spent many enjoyable hours on this beautiful beach , which is the widest of beaches i have travelled to. .and nice and close to santa monica shops etc, great day out",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melcraven8102
40,Iconic,Definitely worth a visit especially at sunset. Go visit the camera obscura while your in the area. A must see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cwatsonandtravel
40,Awesome,Loved the pier and attractions. Also visited the DownTown area with all it's shops and eateries (2nd street). Rented bicycles & took the cycle path up to Venice beach. Not so much a fan of Venice beach. Did not feel unsafe but traveling with kids decided not to visit the market stalls & stick to the cycle track. Finally took the Metro back to Hollywood at 19h00. Took us over a hour but beat sitting in the traffic. Overall a fun day out.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johannt745

50,Santa Monica Bay a Winner !,Driving down Pacific Coast Highway during a sunny clear day is a real treat where Santa Monica meets the ocean. Parking on or below the Pier is quite pricey but if you're going to have Dinner and drinks at the Bubba Gumps Bar (tell Chrissy Steve sent you) it's a real treat. Walk down the stairs near Bubba Gumps to access the sandy beach or even ride a bicycle along the bike path that runs parallel to the ocean just past Temescal Canyon which is about 3.7 miles North. You can ride the bike path South thru Venice to Marina Del Rey if you desire to people watch. The bike path goes down to Torrance Beach but it jogs in and out away from the ocean in certain areas. After 4th of July the Santa Monica Pier has a free Twilight Concert Series every Thursday Night starting at 7 pm featuring some new and old groups. Last summer we saw Eric Burden and the Animals...it was a blast....Rock-N-Roll :-) :-) :-),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevemiller007
40,Great day out,"We park near the beach and was only a few dollars. The walk along the beach is very long but you can hire bikes and electric scooters making this easy.

50,Santa Monica Fun in the Sun,"A day at the beach must include a trip to Santa Monica Pier and all that it encompasses, from a walk on the pier viewing the rides, carnival games, restaurants, and diverse collection of people! People from all places and all walks of life. Then hop in your car to Malibu and grab a fish sandwich at Malibu Seafood. The best fish and breathtaking view of the ocean. Plenty of outside seating all the way up the hill to the top patio. If you want higher end dining then Malibu Beach Hotel is your choice. Sit on the outside patio restaurant and dream of all the possibilities available in Southern California. Right next door is the Malibu pier with more choices of eating you can’t go wrong taking a stroll to watch the sunset! The original Southern California way of life!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/premierlsg

Soak up the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thomaspV6928EA
50,A happy place,"We got the metro train from Los Angeles to the Pier, took about an hour. Lovely sunny day, lots of people about, the pier very bustling and busy and happy. Went on the ferris wheel and got a lovely view of the beaches. Saw a hundred year old carousel which was so nostalgic. There was a very small aquarium nearby. It is also the end of route 66.A typical seaside resort of yesteryear, but in today.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SJS_travels2014

40,Lots of action to see and do!,"The weather was perfect summer weather ( in winter ) and the park, pier and beach were crowded and buzzing with atmosphere! The street performers in the park were amazing and the theme park rides and market stalls and cafes along the pier and on the beach were all busy with tourists and locals. We did see many homeless people in the park which was sad and it made me wonder just what sort of services are available in this big city...This beach has a huge carpark on the beach, a memorial area for servicemen and market stalls on the beach itself....such an eyeopener! Add to that the wafting smell of weed being smoked in the park and it has all the ingredients of the tapestry of life.... Recommend for a visit but wouldn't want to live there as it is too busy for me!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bali2u0812

50,Can't believe how beautiful this place is,"Last day in LA and decided to hit up Santa Monica pier/bay because of raving reviews online. It was so beautiful, with the Pacific Park amusement park on the pier, and just a seemingly endless stretch of soft sand.There's so much to do here. Check out the Pacific Park, browse the vendors on the pier, watch children frolick in the rolling waves (or do so yourself), or play in the sand. After that, get off the pier and stroll/bike/scooter/jog down the long boardwalk to Venice. It can be a bit crowded, so if you're on vacation, definitely go during the weekdays before rush hours.If you're visiting the boardwalk, highly recommend downloading the ""Fire"" app for these Fire motorized scooters - every minute costs 15 cents, and you can just scooter down the boardwalk at a pretty leisurely pace. Pretty cool, and nice to feel the breeze ruffling your hair.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/arilailee
30,Too many people but that L.A. I guess,I chose a midweek day to visit hoping for a smaller number of people but was wrong. Now honestly a beach is a beach pretty much but there was a mystique about going to a place you have heard of for 40 years. It does not look like what you see on tv or even the picture here. It just wasn't all that.It was a day at the beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lavoniaw2017
50,Lots to do and see,"A vast beach area with a real vibe atmosphere. Free things to do to be active whether it be skateboarding, roller skating or climbing & swinging on bars and ropes.

50,Incredibly wonderful beach and views,"Having lived in Los Angeles for 3 years and many visits later, I still love Santa Monica Bay. In fact, when I overnight in the Los Angeles area, I always stay in Santa Monica in part because of the panoramic views of the bay extending to the north and south. On a clear day it is stunningly beautiful.The path along the Bay is convenient and active. It is not only good for exercise but delightful people watching. The views are constantly changing as the sun rises and then sets beautifully into the Pacific Ocean at sunset. You can even enjoy the view and the Bay by walking along Ocean Avenue which looks down on the Pacific Coast Highway the beach area.Most special of all is the sunset. It is spectacular and special. My sons used to crawl along the beach while my wife and I drank a margarita or cold beer. And on the day my youngest son died, I was in Santa Monica when I heard the news. That beach and the sunset will always be very special for me.Don't miss the opportunity to walk, run or simply sit and relax at Santa Monica Bay. It is very special.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/atljpb

40,Really Nice Day Out,Santa Monica is a beautiful beach and fair ground. It wasnt as big as i thought but it was still nice. It takes about an hour but its a lovely walk to the buzzing Venice Beach.

40,Little beach area with flavors and vibes,"There were many little shops on the boardwalk and bike / scooter rentals.We had Eggslut (always amazing!!!) which is closer to Venice Monica beach then walked down the boardwalk to Santa Monica Pier. The little community here is welcoming and there will be a lot of people hustling products of all sorts here!A little northwest of the Santa Monica Pier, there were a ton of typical shops and food that i see in many different countries.This beach is beautiful, worth coming to see if you have at least 3-4 days during your visit. I'd recommend getting the bikes for only an hour, there arent an insane amount of things to see and prices are quite inflated at the shops that cater to tourists.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ExoticIslandsTravelr

50,A Favourite LA Stop,"While we only had a few days in LA, Santa Monica was one of our favourite places. Reminded me a lot more of Australia except the sand goes on for miles. Not sure if the long walk to the water is a good or bad thing! Clean, well to do and beautiful. Definitely worth a visit on any visit to LA. The prom above the beach gives great views up and down the coast.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zalgariath
50,DAYCATION - A DREAM DATE,"SANTA MONICA is alive, active, even passive...whatever you want it to be. The beach is clean, and one could walk miles; the air is clean, crisp, & fresh. Near the beach are fantastic & oh so many restaurants, bars, & parking (all of these require more $$ than a small town).The beach itself is great also for children to swim, make sandcastles, & imagine. A quality stroller would provide your tiny ones & breath of fresh air, and just listening to the waves is calming. A stroll is also great for couples, who may need a good long talk, walk, & be alone. Bicycling is great; make sure it is a BEACH BIKE. Please note that when Hollywood was in its heyday, Santa Monica was THE place. In fact, the famous ROUTE 66 was created for people anywhere from Chicago to Santa Monica. I traveled that route a dozen times, & the arrival to this elegant beach was the climax. You must include this if you are in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LindaMcDermott
50,Romantic,"A very romantic place to visit during sunset. Even with the crowd, the place looked very lovely and serene. I went here capturing GoPro footages and the view is just stunning.Never tried the rides and the food here. I must say, just plain walks here will keep you full and satisfied.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DreiGabriel
50,Best of our LA Trip,The area is clean and picturesque. Park and a beach and the pier.Also many nice shops and restaurants when you are ready for a stroll. Try to spend one day here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rockcole
50,Beautiful,This is one of the most beautiful beaches in California. The Santa Monica pier is also fun to walk and there are lots of cool places to eat where you might be able to share a table with someone from anywhere in the world. There are lots of places to buy souvenirs too. Sunsets are spectacular.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/timtraveler14
50,Beautiful!!,"What could possibly disappoint?!?Beautifully clean uncrowded beaches in the SoCal sunshine, plenty of parking and only a short stroll from the bars and restaurants of Ocean Drive or the shopping and coffee of 3rd Street Promenade!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Westwick
50,I was in awe!,"I absolutely love the beach, so obviously I HAD to check out Santa Monica while I was in Los Angeles! it was a clean beach with great waves and good restaurants as well as shopping. It is very touristy, so if that isn't your thing, it's not the place for you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Darcydanielle
50,Local Favorite,"Santa Monica is a great getaway from the city. If you are a local or just in LA visiting and don't have too much time/or a car, Santa Monica is the beach to hit up. It is accessible by Metro using the blue Expo line however driving is also simple but parking can get pricey as prices fluctuate during peak times. The pier offers fantastic views of the surrounding areas, quick eats, souvenir shops, fishing, a killer arcade (old and new games) and a mini theme park including a ferris wheel and rollercoaster. The rides get pricey ($6/ride) however if you are to choose one, take the ferris wheel at night or sunset. The beach is usually crowded near the pier but walk north or south a bit and you will find plenty of space including exercise areas, volleyball nets, and bathrooms. Off the beach, a few blocks east of Ocean Avenue, downtown Santa Monica offers a great shopping area with name brands like H&M, Victoria Secret, Johnny Rockets, and a movie theatre.TIP: Sunset is a great time. You will find many photographers, couples, families, and locals on the sand to watch the sunset.Fun fact: This is the pier where they filmed Lost Boys!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amberxapocalypse
50,Beaufiful bay and nice sea side city,"The Santa Monica Bay is extremely beautiful, stretching from Malibu to Palos Verdes. Many beautiful beaches to choose from with great views of the city and even Catalina island. After driving or walking on the beach, you can go to the Santa Monica Pier and people watch, shop, eat or enjoy carnival rides. Up from the pier is the 3rd Street Promenade in the city of Santa Monica. Lots of shops and good restaurants to partake. Fun place to go for the entire family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mcorbin560
40,Beautiful but pricey,Santa Monica Bay is a beautiful bay with stunning beaches but activities here can be expensive. You can walk from here to Venice beach which makes a nice stroll as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JXXXR
50,A great beach area!!,"Santa Monica Bay is great beach area!! (I live further south) This location is amazing on the water in Santa Monica. There is so much to see and do here. Shopping, eating (especially The Lobster on the pier), etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ace90266
50,Definitely a place to see,"This area is a must see, especially for someone who has never been to LA. It was about a 20 to 30 minute drive from downtown LA. The pier has lots of interesting characters, souvenir shops and kiosks. There are restaurants as well with indoor and outdoor seating. The amusement section is small, but children and adults alike can have a good time with the rides, or the carnival atmosphere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lillieh498
40,Summer is here in January!,"Yes, with 72 F or warmer up to 84F this is the place to be, roler blades, bikes, you name it, restaurants and of course the famous beach. come and play. recommended MeuterMedia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MeuterMedia
50,Shore is nice!,"Park anywhere you like to take in this lovely coastline! Pay lots are abundant, but so too is ample free parking up Temescal Canyon, below Pali High (a locals secret🤫). You can enjoy the Bay during the day for all the right outdoor reasons- bike or skate for miles on the smooth bike path or choose to walk in the water along the shore as you beach comb for shells and other treasures. Did you know sunset over the coast is a great photo op, too?! All of this is a wonderful, relaxing escape from day to day hassles! This has been my family’s go to place for 3 generations and the magic still holds true!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/239RebeccaR
50,Relaxing place,The beach near the Santa Monica Pier is always crowded on weekends and when it is good weather (almost always it is good). Great place to walk near the ocean and just relax.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/talgatd
50,Great for staying active,"This was a fun cute area of Santa Monica. The pier itself is smaller than I thought. There are more activities on the pier for kids with rides. Outside the pier you can walk, ride a bike, play sport or any other type of activity. Great scene and friendly people.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/9_Travelbug26
50,Just a lovely place to hang out.,Really enjoyed shopping at Santa Monica Place. Lots of history in the architecture and street art. Lovely arcades full of restaurants.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sydneyshopgirl
50,A must do when ending the Route 66,it was one of my child memories to visit this pier when finishing the Route 66 on a motorcycle. Did it and it was worth it. After a very long day traveling looking at the sea and feeling the vibe it boosts all the energy levels lost during the whole day. Cant wait to go back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/quimzinho
40,Like the East Coast Boardwalk on a small scale,Fun pier to walk out on; lovely long beach with views to swim or sunbathe on; busy times bring lots of people but the whole thing is a happening CA style. We enjoyed the whole scene. Go out to the end of the pier...it feels like you are really in the ocean!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/452lesliee
40,good beach,nice beach to hang out and have some fun with family. There are many shops around the area. It is difficult to park.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Thibassi
40,The Hotel California On Legs,"Every city in Los Angeles has it's own look, rhythm and dress code and Santa Monica is no different. If you are a woman it's minimal makeup, tanned and no bra. If you are a guy it's tattoos if you are younger, a little more muscle than the normal guy and some expensive if you know what you're looking for piece of clothing or accessory. There are no exceptions. You may also pass some transients and sadly economically displaced individuals on the walk from wherever you parked your car to the bay. Be wary of anyone who looks ""out of it"" because looks don't deceive.Now you are at the beach, and things literally start to get cool. The heat of Los Angeles is replaced by a beautiful just right breeze. The indigenous look of Santa Monica residents is replaced by having the diversity of the world right in front of you. It is a heady mix of tourists from around the world and the residents of Los Angeles who have come to escape the heat of Los Angeles, their busy lives and just have fun, fun, fun. The beach is clean and well patrolled by lifeguards. There are bathrooms on the pier which you should probably use before the family sets foot on the sand and you can just have a great day enjoying your friends and loved ones. Look for any signs and/or red flags that warn you of places not to swim or if you plan on doing a spot of fishing what you should not eat. Afterward, take a walk to Venice, or go eat at one of the many tasty eateries in Santa Monica that cater to all tastes and price points. So wear what the heck you want, take water, sunscreen and comfy shoes for your feet and have a ball. That is what Santa Monica is all about.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelsG3005BB
50,When LA gets to ya,This is the place I went to clear my head - a bit of fresh air while dipping my toes in the cold water,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/341idab
40,Great,We went to Santa Monica for a day out it was such a great place to visit and lots to see and do. Well worth going to.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/726nigelp
50,Santa Monica Fog,"Great place to visit. The Pier and attractions are worth the trip. Take a walk along the beach to Muscle Beach. We also went at night where one of California's famous fogs moved in and you could not see 10 foot in front of you. It then cleared after an hour, an incredible sight.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/596StevenC
50,A nice day trip from Los Angeles,"We took a bus from the airport area to get here in 50 minutes. It was a Saturday and there were a walking street and market near the pier. We walked around and took a lot of pictures. The bay was very nice but the water was VERY cold during our visit. Anyway, it is a MUST visit attraction when in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CCMMZhang
50,Family,Great place to visit and shop. A lot of great places to dine in. It is also a great family getaway and I would definitely recommend it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/452eliasn
40,Great for kids,"Something for everyone, but there's nothing that compares to the beaches in Australia. The water looked cold, but there was still people out swimming, flags lined the beach, as well as crosses for the fallen soldiers which was very emotional.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jmason15
30,A nice walk along the beach towards Venice Beach,THe highlight is the Monterey Jetty where Route 66 ends. Photo opportunities aplenty here! A nice somple beach that also has many surfers.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TriStupe
40,Great Stroll along the pier and beach.,"you have to go out on the concrete walkway to the beach edge. It was The day after Christmas so it was a little cold, but the views were spectacular!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tamoriac
40,Classic landmark,"We stayed near the pier so it was only a short walk. A bit busy as it was Christmas, but good fun never the less. Paddled in the Pacific to get rid of our jet lag. There are a lot of homeless people there which we weren't expecting, very sad to see in a country with such wealth.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sazinsoto
50,Love it here,"Santa Monica is one of my favourite places in the LA area - the nostalgia of the pier , the food options and the shopping are all great.It’s busy and very touched by human hand but you’d still never know that LA was just a few miles along the boulevard",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travelozzy
50,Santa Monica Pier,"Such a beautiful place to see. We hired a bike at Venice Beach, rode over the pier & spent about an hour there. Not really anywhere on the pier to site down and eat however there is plenty a few minutes walk away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cannons88
30,Cheesy and Not Especially Scenic,"I was in Santa Monica Bay 20 years ago when I was much younger and sort of like it. However, in the recent visit, I feel it is not as good as I remember. Possibly it is also because the day I visited (the Saturday before New Years' Eve), I feel it is overcrowded and the atmosphere is too cheesy.The beach was crowded but the water did not too tempting for swimming. The beach itself is also not specially scenic.If this is your first time to Los Angeles (or, even the first time to the United States), it can be an interesting experience and a good photo opportunity. For people who are local and been to LA many times, there are other better (more scenic) beaches to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Saricie_Q
30,Santa Monica Pier,"My husband, son (age 48), and I wanted to see Santa Monica Pier on a recent trip to West Hollywood to visit our younger son, so we went. We are from Sonoma Co and used to the San Francisco pier and the Monterey pier. I expected to see something like the Monterey pier. It is not!The beach is beautiful and seems to go on for miles, but the pier itself had a lot of cheap touristy stuff on it, no restaurants, and an amusement park next to it. There were also 3 ""preachers"" along the pier.If that is what you are looking for, then the pier would be fine. We had hoped to find a nice seafood restaurant on the pier, as there are in Monterey, so it was a let down. We decided that it was not a place to which we wished to return.We went back to the Westlake shopping center and ate at a restaurant called the Italy, which had excellent Italian food.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/285suzanneg
50,be ready to swim,"nice warm sand, bring your drink to cool down. nice sun tan is recommended. do not worry about getting wet",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hassanaK9640ZH
50,Feels the teen spirit,"With a small amusement park on the pier, the vibe at Santa Monica is quite teen-ish. Yet it's a beautiful beach with a lovely backdrop of hills. So many options to eat and shop makes it an ideal day for a day out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sahilbanga
40,Who doesn't like the beach?,"OK, for visitors...DO NOT swim too close to the S. M. Pier. Bacteria from birds all around the pier is in the ocean and not great for humans. That said, it's a must visit. A lot of traffic on weekends. Great restaurants nearby. Rent a bike and ride along the path past Venice to Marina Del Ray.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/billegee123
40,A great place to visit,"We visited this location in Dec 17, and it was very quite. There was heaps of parking available. The Pier was great we stayed to the evening so the kids could goto the fair. A must see if in the LA area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VirginiaM305
50,"Great place to go to the pier, beach, farmer's market, and eat!","We love spending a half day or more in Santa Monica. We often go to the Saturday Farmer's market on Arizona and get organic produce. We love to go to the pier and walk around, sit on the beach and make a sand castle, and eat at Bubba Gumps. It's a great place to spend the day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/susansM9588XE
50,"This is about the bay, not the pier.","I thought that the title of this ""place"" was kind of funny -- ""Santa Monica Bay"", but the address is for the pier. Well, the pier is fun, but that's a review for another day. This is about the bay itself, the long crescent that runs down from Malibu to Palos Verdes, that contains a host of sea life, sailboats, fishing boats, usually an oil tanker or two, with an astonishing amount of Marine traffic on its western edge.There are some key geographic markers for the landlubbers and sailers alike. For me, it starts at the north with the Malibu pier. Some brave souls will anchor nearby, as the depth is relatively shallow and take a kayak in, but there's no official landing: you'll have to surf in and beach the kayak. Then there's the Santa Monica Pier, (the address above). That has a lot of history, and still has the old-time 20's vibe to it. If you're out to sea, you'll be sure to notice the seals and sea lions that hang out on the buoy near the pier, and watch out for the submerged shoals north of the pier. It's a good marker--we like to sail up just past the pier, and tack back down toward the Marina. If the wind is right, we'll set the spinnaker just to put on a show for the kids on the pier.Along this stretch as well, you'll see parasailers (especially in summer) being towed by speedboats along the beach, which is also a pretty sight. Some other marine life to look out for include Pacific sunfish basking near the surface, and not infrequently a curious dolphin or three. And if you're fishing, you'll probably meet a seal trying to steal your catch.Further south, there's the Venice pier, and the Marina Del Rey harbor entrance, marked by a giant American flag. There's a distinct aroma here, as a large colony of sea lions can be found hanging out on the breakwater year round. Further south, you'll almost certainly pass an oil tanker riding at anchor near the El Segundo refinery pipeline -- if you're on a keel boat at low tide, be careful of the snags! You'll pass under the LAX flight path on your way to King Harbor, which is a fun stop. Pro tip: you can reserve a mooring at basin 3 for 24 bucks a night should you need to stop on your way up or down the coast.Southern tip ends with Malaga Cove, named after one of my favorite cities in Spain. The Palos Verdes cliffs rise up, covered with some of the most expensive real estate in the Los Angeles area.You can get charters and daytrips for sightseeing, fishing and whalewatching on the Bay from Marina Del Rey and King Harbor. It's the fastest way to get out of the city, and deep into nature within at least three hundred miles. Or you can just rent a Sabot or Lazer, or paddleboard and just tool around the marina. One note of caution: paddleboarders, please look out for the boats: they don't have brakes! Crossing in front of someone's bow could lead to less than optimum outcomes!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dougr846
30,"Good News, Bad News","Here’s the good: It’s really fun to walk on the pier. Take a ride on the merry-go-round and then have a great hamburger at Pier Burger. For a high-end experience, have martinis and lobster at The Lobster.The bad: There has been a lot of crime on that beach and under The Pier. The ocean has tested as one of the dirtiest. It’s not safe at night to be on the beach at all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lurkinc
40,Friendly Santa Monica,"Santa Monica is a friendly place to visit. The Pier is the main attraction. Lots of rides for the kids, and many restaurants within walking distance at all cost levels. If you swim it is best to walk a hundred yards away from the pier before you put down your blanket. Water is cleaner away from the pier. Water is never Mediterranean warm in the Pacific. Don't be surprised if it's a bit chilly. The Promenade is three blocks from the Pier. Take a walk down the shops. The view from the top of Ocean Blvd is spectacular. Venice is ten minutes down the shore, and Malibu is thirty minutes up the shore. You can ride a bike on a path next to the ocean for miles, if you wish. Or take a hike in the mountains above Malibu. It's a friendly place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ROG13

50,"Rides, rides, rides!","Santa Monica pier is always fun for swimming, sunbathing, eating, drinking, shopping, surfing, fishing, and...carnival rides! Parking at the pier is reasonable and will save you loads of time. Many tourists don't realize you can park right on the pier and save your walking for the attractions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kl417g
30,Good for sunset viewing,"這裡很美！但水蠻冷的！ 基本上只待1、2小時的話推薦將車停在橋上，因為不貴的！ 而停周遭大型停車場反而超貴。 （麥當勞旁那個停車場）Water was cold, but the sunset here is really beautiful! You can also have the colorful ferries to be your photo shoot background.Parking is not easy to find during the weekend. Highly recommend to park ""on the pier"", because the fee is actually not bad compared to the public one( next to the Macdonald), ifffff you only will stay on the pier for about couple of hours.Watch out your kids, because the sea waves here are very crazy and dangerous.We didn't try the restaurant here called water grill or something, but I heard it was a good place. I might give it a try next time when we visit here!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vanessalT6894IZ
30,Long stretch of beach,Nice big beach. Small waves but watch for under current. Plenty of firm and soft sand. Gets very busy in summer. Santa Monica Pier nearby and a bit touristy. Plenty of homeless around but they keep to themselves.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mike-5774

Look for Domino, he's the best waiter there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bennylimlee
40,Afternoon in the Sunshine,After being rushed through Hollywood in the morning we spent a relaxing afternoon in Santa Monica. The pier is pleasant to walk along the pier look at the scenery and soak up the atmosphere. This is of course where Baywatch was filmed unfortunately no sign of Pamela Anderson!. This was our first full day in California and i liked Santa Monica very much. It has an old world charm about it. Do not be alarmed by the vagrants you see walking around they do not seem to bother anybody. After a walk we went into the town and found a splendid English pub just up the road called The Olde King's Head. You can sit outside in the sunshine watch the scenery and drink draught Boddingtons at 8 US$ a pint!. Better then Bud Lite!. Great pub in a nice town!. Well worth a visit!.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RogerJerseyCI
30,A tourist trap clean beach.,"Most people come to the Pier where you ll be met by various vendors and typical tourist attractions, amusement park, ferris wheel, hamburger stands, clowns, sketch artists, etc. Very few people venture to go down to the beach, which has nothing special to offer, Other nearby beaches proved to be superior. Spend 30-45 going down and up the Pier take all the selfies you want and then head for downtown Santa Monica just few blocks away. Enjoy the sun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/216spring

50,Beautiful beach,Always the first place I head to when I arrive in LA. Such a relaxed vibe. The beach is so clean and during the weekdays not so densely populated as it is over the weekend. Lots of places to eat and drink. I like to grab a slice of Joes pizza on Broadway which is the best pizza in the world. There are great shops also at 3rd St Promenade.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karenfanti

40,SM summarizes a CA Beach.,"Santa Monica beach captures much of what So Cal beaches are about. Lots of people, cold waters (typically), and not much rain.Traveler Tip: I've lived in So Cal most of my life and grew up going to the beach. Junior Lifeguards as a child and then surfing multiple times a week or just going for a quick jog as an adult. Santa Monica has a nice blend of activities with the boardwalk and 3rd street promenade so I'd say it's a pretty good choice for someone visiting CA and looking to get the full experience.I'm a fellow traveler so I appreciate when other people have given me tips/recommendations while in a new city.

10,Those lovely Days are no longer ....,"Every other week, my boys and I used to make a day of it at Santa Monica Beach and the Promenade. Wandering along the walkway and pier, swimming, biking and enjoying food and music along the Promenade. As of a year or so ago, those lovely days are no longer . The once fresh breezes blowing ocean air are now blowing the inescapable smoke of a horrifyingly ridiculous amount off hookahs, cigarettes, marijuana and e- cigarettes. And the people smoking these .....well, they could care less if they are standing next to a 3 yr old blowing their smoke directly into a child's face / lungs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/raqs2015

40,Really enjoyed our visit to the Bay and Santa Monica Pier!,"We visited Santa Monica Pier with our 2 kids (age 6 and 3) as part of our week-long spring break vacation in the LA area. Overall we really enjoyed it. We played some of the games and went on a few of the kid rides, and the ferris wheel. Views were spectacular. It was a bit crowded but we managed with a stroller just fine. Carousel was also a classic experience. Beautiful at night with the skyline and the pier all lit up. It was a bit of a walk from where we parked to the pier entrance but doable even with 2 small kids. This place is worth a visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GoGreenGoWhite1
30,Beautiful view,"Surprised by the artificial lights they have on the beach and how late they allow cars to enter. I live on Atlantic side and our beach has a cutoff time for vehicles entering and no artificial lighting, disappointed at the litter and lack of respect. Shops, restaurants, and such to enjoy. Regardless, go and get your feet wet and sandy and stay for the beautiful sunsets. It's iconic area and need to see at least once if you're visiting,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FreqTrav704

There were a lot of people at the beach, but it didn't feel overly crowded and it was still very peaceful and relaxing walking along the beach. There was also plenty of open space for picnics or sports or just hanging out. The pier was pretty neat and had a variety of attractions and restaurants. The view from the end of the pier back at the shoreline and city was pretty neat as well. It was definitely a nice afternoon at the beach, and I would 100% go back if I'm in the area again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lingeringmagic

50,Iconic and worth a visit! Free parking under 90 minutes,"Keep your visit short and you could enjoy the Santa Monica Pier and Beach for FREE. All public lots off of 2nd, 4th, 5th are FREE under 90 minutes. All the beach parking lots are about $12/day or part thereof. My kids love the fitness obstacle course on the south side of the pier. You can see alot of folks doing their tight rope, Cirque du Soleil type acrobatics or just gymnastics conditioning all around. Rent bikes, go on rides on the pier or just buy junk food. It's fun if you feel like dealing with the crowds. Groupon recently had an all day pass for the pier rides. Avoid coming on Saturday, it's just nuts. Do Friday afternoon or Sunday late in the day to have a better chance at finding a decent parking spot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/174elyzabethp

50,Awesome place and great beach vibe,"This is one of those places that you go to because you are in LA. Because the pier is the start/end of route 66 it is another great reason just to go there.Found people here to be laid back and very unstressed.

50,A fiesta !,"It's a beach and pier with an atmosphere of its own. Very distinct, quaintly charming yet teeming with visitors of all ages at all times. There are attractions down the pier on both sides of the wooden path for children and adults . Enchanting music, mouth watering smells of all kinds of food from several stalls , ferry wheels and merry-go-rounds with squeeling children on the one side and those getting sprayed by playful beach waves on the other only add to the magic. Please go with some time on hand - you would not want to return !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/212manju

40,I Left My Heart in Santa Monica,"Few know the historic significance of Santa Monica Bay. Spanish explorer, Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo commanded the first European expedition to the west coast of the America. He dropped anchor in Santa Monica in 1542, a mere fifty years after Columbus sailed the ocean blue to the new world in 1492. There was no Panama canal then so he had to navigate the treacherous water around the south tip of South America.Fast forward to modern times. One might wonder why Los Angeles was not first settled with Santa Monica as the epicenter. The rich and famous discovered it, including William Randolph Hurst who built his mistress Marion Davies a palatial mansion right on the beach. The mansion is long gong but the olympic sized pool remains open to the public along with her guest house -- which by today's standards could be considered a modest mansion -- also open to the public.The best place to appreciate the panoramic vista of the bay is along Pacific Palisades Park. Lined by palm trees, it is in my opinion the most picturesque spot in Santa Monica if not all of Los Angeles. It begins at Pico Blvd. and winds north all the way up to San Vicente Blvd. From there you can view from left to right, Palos Verdes peninsula, Catalina Island, the iconic Santa Monica Pier (with roller coaster and ferris wheel at the end) and Malibu.Don't miss the 3rd Street Promenade mall that begins at the famous Miramar Hotel (every movie star from the golden age and luminaries from all over the world have stayed there -- and where I honeymooned). Walk south to Santa Monica Place outdoor mall.There are many great restaurants that adorn Ocean Avenue, with open window views of Palisades Park and the bay. If you are lucky, you may see a pod of Killer Whales that call the bay their home.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/266PaulR
30,It is a nice place to people watch and look at the ocean from a world famous pier.,"It's free to walk to and enter if you are staying in Santa Monica. I'd park at the Third Street Promenade parking (free), earlier in the day the better, and walk down the driveway towards the Pier. It's a nice pier with attractions and rides for the kids. On a clear day you can see as far north as Pt. Dume and and far south as the Santa Catalina Islands. As the day progresses though, it becomes slightly sketchy as a certain element starts to show up. Nothing to be alarmed about, but definitely more adult at that point. If you are staying in the City, take the Expo train line, which goes directly there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidmZ4014DO
50,Must See,"If you are in the area, this one is a must see. It's iconic. It's beautiful and dirty all at the same time. Glad my daughter and I were able to take it all in and stroll down the beach to the next stop. The walkway between the beaches was fun and we enjoyed people watching.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/a5brown

50,Beautiful!,"It was a beautiful day and not too crowded at the time we visited, but was filling up by the time were heading out.

40,Iconic Beach visit,"My son loved visiting Santa Monica. Its a very iconic beach with lots of people around. FYI we did encounter some seemingly troubled individuals late at night that seemed to be homeless and that did make us somewhat uneasy (because they were yelling out from the street corners and lurking on the sides of buildings. I enjoyed walking the trail that goes toward Venice, although we were too tired to walk the entire way. My son enjoyed the water, but it was too cold for me to get in. We walked around on the pier and took in the sites but did not visit any of the shops or ride any rides. My son wasn't too worried about doing any of that. We watched a beautiful sunset, which was great to pictures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/531samanthaj

50,VARIETY - DEFINITELY THE SPICE OF LIFE,"Santa Monica is the mid way beach inbetween Venice and Malibu and definitely has a flavor all of it's own. Whether you're looking to do a bit of exercise; stretching those muscles, acrobats, walking the rope, pull ups, biking, skating, swimming, walking, you'll find it all here.if you're not into that it's also good, you can just watch them perform for fun, wonder and interest and then move on to more tamer things. Visit the Aquarium, go to the Pier - full of things to do, see. eat and performers to listen to .....This is probably the best for a family / tourist beach in my opinion.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shoshanah546

A fun Carnival style attraction.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/foxymcfoxface
20,Santa Monica Bay - Needs Our Clean-up Efforts,"Though you can't compare the beaches of Hawaii in any way shape or form to those on our Southern California shores, it was a sad day to visit Santa Monica Bay (far from the Pier - because it's normally cleaner), to find the water to be very dirty and littered with trash and bits of tar/oil from the rigs off-shore.I've previously enjoyed coming here - close to LifeGuard Station 24-27, for the gentler waves so you can swim in the ocean, but sadly it's been a tough summer here and we need to clean our bay - again :(",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChrissyVeeReviews
50,Hire a bike,We recommend to hire a bike from Venice or Santa Monica and drive to the other side. Very nice to do!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lauraoosting
50,Great Beach Vacation Spot to Relax,I visited Santa Monica Bay twice in the past three months. I hope that should give you a hint of how I love this place. The weather was amazing and the ocean wind took all the work stress out of me. I will definitely recommend this place to anyone who is looking to have a relaxing vacation.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Depasco
30,Visti to Santa Monica Pier,The visit to Santa Monica is definitely a worth while trip. It is something to do while in the area. I would not go out of my way to visit there but if in the area its entertaining. Always very busy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aaronvp888

40,Great people watching,"Go early so parking is easier. Great people watching here! Even if you don't want to lay out in the sun, it's just fun walking around!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DougD1390
40,Fun in the Sun,The pier was really cool to walk down with a lot of street performances and chances to buy souvenirs. The beach was very nice but a little crowded. There is plenty of beach to camp out on. The town is really cute too. There are cool food trucks along the street before going down to the beach with really amazing food.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hi2kaila
30,Lots of sand,I've been going to Santa Monica Bay (beach) since I was a child. I prefer other beaches because the sand it quite gritty and it's a long walk from the road to the water.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C3763ETlisam
40,Better than I remembered!,"It's been a long time since i was last here, and compared to Australian beaches I was pretty unimpressed last time.On re-visiting, it was more impressive. Don't know about the surf- its a long way away, but we rented bikes and had a blast riding to Venice Beach. The contrast between S. Monica and Venice is really pronounced, Venice being edgy and fun and S. M rather more establishment.Great bike track right on the sand and flat all the way! I",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gra1Sydney
40,South end of the beach at Santa Monica,"If you want to experience time on the beach, the south end of Santa Monica has an enormous parking lot and, on the south end, a wooden walkway that gets you through much of that expanse of soft sand. The bath house is pretty large and adjacent to the walkway. North side of parking lot is hourly, south is daily ~$8. I pay for the day to get close to the walkway. 3400 Barnard Way, Santa Monica, CA 90405 is the address of the playground that is on the south end of the parking lot. Sometimes the children go to this excellent playground before going on the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/parrishh2013
40,Crowded and little dirty,"Santa Monica Bay is the picturesque beach of LA, but it's not the best beach nor is it the cleanest. The pier keeps it crowded and dirty, especially on the weekends.I'm not sure why beach-goers get in the water near the pier because it doesn't look all that refreshing. The storefronts along the beach are in the renovation process and are constantly changing.For the most part, it's just far too crowded, but the name is what draws both tourists and city-dwelling Angelenos alike.Just don't park at the beach. It's a hassle to get in and out of when PCH starts to back up (which is typically all the time). I would suggest parking up on 4th, Colorado, or any of the main streets in Santa Monica and just walk down. Standing at the top, looking down is also a great photo opportunity to capture both the coastline and the pier.My suggestion is... if you want a refreshing day at the beach, there are plenty of other beaches I could point you too, but if you want to get out of your element and feel like a true tourist, then Santa Monica is the perfect place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emgudino
40,Santa Monica love it,So nice to visit Santa Monica Bay‬ in the night . there is alot of great food near by. nice Facilities of a cool fair,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ADaminko
30,The beach of Santa Monica,The beach is beautiful. You have to pay to park but typically someone pass on there parking spot ticket. Its 10$. Sunset is just speechless. Unfortunately you have to walk about 2 blocks to get to the water. Its on an incline down. The winds and waves were high this day and there was an advisory. Other than loosing my senior citizen mother for 2 hours on the beach.. it was great.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thelmaas
30,Overrated and dirty,"Drove from LA to Santa Monica for its famous pier.Not impressed at all, stayed there 30 minutes and left.Would rather go to Manhattan or Huntington Beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JEV23
40,Wonderful Pier,"On our coastal drive from Santa Ana to Ventura we stopped off at Venice Beach for lunch and then called to Pacific Park Pier. This is a wonderful pier with ample and reasonably priced parking. Lots of outlets and fairground rides as well as entertaining buskers. The only lack was perhaps and Ice Cream Stand at the pier end.A very relaxing few hours can be spent here. I didn't go down onto the beach but my beautiful young wife did and it seemed to be fine, it certainly looks fabulous!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kildress
50,Summer Relief,We actually briefly visited Santa Monica on our tour and decided to go back the next day to explore more. I'd always wanted to walk on the Pier. Day was perfect. We were there early and by the time we were leaving it was getting very busy. A must see. Huge beach and coastline and you could see Malibu in the distance.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kelvinandamanda
50,Beautiful golden beach,"We hired bikes close to Venice canals and cycled along the beach cycle track through Venice to Santa Monica. The golden sand looked beautiful in the sunshine, there was lots to see and photograph, happy holidaymakers mingled with cyclists, skaters and Segway riders. Santa Monica pier is huge and we enjoyed an ice cream as we strolled along and took it all in. There were plenty of places to leave our bikes locked up and we walked up into Santa Monica from here for lunch. The area was beautifully looked after and another time I would like to stay here as there is so much to see and enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alisonpal
30,Nice beach & views to take a stroll.,"I visited in May 2016 last year, on my solo trip to Cali. I was lucky enough to go on the day the metro line (light blue) opened up to Downtown Santa Monica, which saved me a whole lot of hassle to get there in the first place. Since it was the opening, the metro line was packed, packed, packed. The metro ride is a good 40min, if you are starting from Downtown LA (Hollywood red line). Also, the metro is incredibly cheap (but not 100% safe, so be smart and alert). For a 1 week unlimited pass, which included metro AND bus, I paid 25.00$. Certain areas do not have a metro line yet, so you will have to grab a bus (double check on the metro map before you set out to leave - they show maps with new lines, but they aren't open yet. That was a tad confusing to me, and it did ruin some of my original planning for transport). Santa Monica is big with lots of restaurants, shops, endless beachline and an amusement park at the pier. Since I was alone, I simply walked about exploring, but it was not a hit for me (I'm not a beach fan to begin with). But if you love shopping and laying down on the beach, this is the place to be. If I had stayed a shorter time in LA, I would have skipped this visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ladyscotland55

50,Nice slice of SoCAl,"The Santa Monica area is full of things to do. There is shopping nearby, restaurants for all tastes, an amusement park at the pier, or you can spend a lazy day on the beach. For the more active there is a running/wal;king path on the boardwalk or along Ocean Avenue. There is something for everyone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/901syedh

50,It's Beachy,"We found a parking spot just slightly south of the Pier. If you've ever driven here you know that's a miracle! The grassy area by the parking is quite nice. It's a good spot for a picnic.We walked over to the beachside via the overhead walkway. It's a bit smelly in spots. The beach is wide and the waves are great. The water is cold in July... don't worry, you'll get used to it quickly. The undertow is pretty strong. Keep an eye on small children it could pull them under. We've seen a lot of piers so we skipped this one, enjoyed the beach and then back to the hotel for showers and a nice dinner.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MettaMoon

30,Dissapointed,"Glad I went just to say, ""I've seen the famous SM Pier"" go back....NOPE. This place is filthy. Homeless people everywhere and people begging for money. The smell of Dope hits you every hundred feet. The beach was so packed, it looked like ants in a sugar farm. The boardwalk smelled of urine and body odor from all the homeless. SAD :(",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/854rodneyt
50,Great beach.,"A perfect way to spend a day at the beach. We parked at the South Parking Lot #4 - $8 for the day, midweek and parked 20 feet from the sand. Uncrowded, great warm surf to play in and fine clean sand - overall a great day",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danieldM8562RR

50,Fabulous Day,"We spent a whole day in Santa Monica. there is so much to do here. We visited the little aquarium under the pier, walked up and down the pier, so much entertainment going on, There was a rock band playing made up of a family of brothers and sisters from about 8 or 9 to 15 years old and they were great. After the pier we walked along the beach for bit before coming in land and spent some time around the shops before having some food and then a movie. Even that was amazing, we do not have such luxurious cinemas were I live in UK. I tell anyone that asks me about highlights of our trip to LA that out day in Santa Monica was definitely one.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tussox
50,Beautiful views of the ocean,"We travelled here by train - only an hour's journey from Hollywood. It was worth the ride, we walked on the pier and also walked to Venice Beach and back. The latter is about 40 minute walk from the pier. We sat on the beach and my son swam - there are strong tides so you do have to be careful where you swim, and listen to the lifeguards. Some parts of the sea are reserved for surfing and water sports. We enjoyed paddling near some rock pools where there are little crabs. Lovely clean beach with sand - it gets very hot at midday so don't walk barefoot! We got a bit sunburnt - make sure you keep topping up the sun cream.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clairesP6164EE

50,Fabulous beaches and a great cycle route,"We hired bikes in Venice beach and rode along the dedicated cycle lanes to Santa Monica Pier. The beaches are long and wide and there is plenty of room for everyone to stretch out and, if you're brave enough (the waves are huge) to go for a swim.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KJG780
40,Dealing with summer weekend madness,"Santa Monica and its beaches are justifiably a top tourist destination but the summer weekends get very crowded. As a resident I know it well. Parking is difficult to find near the pier and the traffic is heavy. If you must come on a busy weekend here are some tips.1. Take the train. There is a rail line from downtown all the way to the beach. Park at one of the of the other stations like Culver City2. Try the Municipal parking lot off Main St and Pico Blvd if you do drive to SM3. Enjoy the beach north of the pier: its worth the walk along the path to get away from the noise and crowds4. Eat on Main St south of Pico. Great noodles, vegan Thai, ice cream shops.5. Rent a bike from Sobi the SM bike share program",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jimmymahon

Also Palisades Park along Ocean Ave in Santa Monica which over looks the bay is also very popular as well. Summer months, especially on weekends and holidays is a challenge to get in to Santa Monica. Parking can be very pricey during those months. The best way is to take the Metro Expo Line to Downtown Santa Monica and walk four blocks to the pier and the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Metrotorrance

40,Rent a bike and see the sights!,I rented a bike and cycled from venice beach to santa monica pier on the costal bike path. Was really relaxing and a great way to see the sights. Beach seemed relatively clean and their are lots of shops/stalls to buy souvenirs. There are a lot of homeless people but that seems to be the case across the whole of LA but on the whole I felt safe and had a great afternoon out. Be aware that parking in this area is a nightmare - the street parking is limited and the car parks that are available are really expensive ($20 flat charge). Not too bad if you are spending the whole day but too much just for a few hours in my opinion.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BexBennett9

50,Always beautiful,"Santa Monica Bay really begins in Malibu and ends in Palos Verdes. It is vast and varied. Its best seen on the excellent bicycle path that runs for most of it length. Santa Monica Pier and Venice are interesting of of course. But what I find most interesting is that large pockets of it feel like you are on a deserted island.

My visit to Santa Monica Bay brought a homely feel to LA for me, just with LA flare. There was so much excitment all around, from the excited tourists, pets, street entertainers to the kids in the amusement park, sun bathers and diners.

40,"Nice clean beach, nice pier and nice people","It can get quite busy after about 3pm but I went early and I enjoyed it. I am not normally a pier person so that's saying something. Worth a visit. It's nice to just hang out. I'm not sure what makes it a 'tourist trap' - I mean, they sell postcards etc. but that's every pier. It's full of both tourists and regular everyday locals. It's a good place to be. I just relax on my own. Also you can get City wi-fi here (it's free).

Huge meals and very tasty, but popular so you may need to wait for a table",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fancypantsdancer2009
50,"Any day here, beats any day there","OK, First things first ~ find parking. The beach lots are reasonable and usually have spots available if you can navigate the traffic to get to them, I suggest going two blocks east where the parking is free and un-metered so you can stay all-day. They clean the sand often and even their restrooms are safe enough. The sand goes on for miles and the waves gently roll in ~ continuously!! Slow down, relax and stay while.

30,"Good views. pleasant beach and pier, but extremely busy in the summer",Visitors would find the beach here a very wide beach and there is a well known Santa Monica Pier with a small amusement area on it. The area and streets offer good views and it can be very hard to find parking and the pier itself is very buys and contested over summer.Its a pleasant experience and also its pleasant walking along the beach or up at street level just wondering along and watching all the people go by.If you're in the are its worth a visit.If you hire a car you can easily visit this attraction and later in the afternoon drive through Beverly Hills and then up to the Hollywood Hills sign,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BjL461

This is set up and maintained by protestors, so I keep my mouth shut. However, it is a good photo opportunity.Walk up the steps to the pier and there is Bubba Gumps across from which is Santa Monica PD sub station.On the pier, which is a pleasant walk, there are booths with people selling their wares and further on many people are fishing.There is an amusement park which is lit up at night. Many rides for adults and kids. Not so cheap but fun for the kids.Many people are swimming during nice weather and this can be observed just by looking over the rail of the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sacmabSimiValley

50,A Keeper!,"In my last trip to Los Angeles, we visited three beaches: Malibu, Venice, and Santa Monica. I'd say this was for us the best. Malibu is kind of further North from the city, and not wroth unless you are staying in Malibu. Venice was shocking, bizarre, and not a family friendly place. Malibu, on the contrary, is very family friendly, the town is gorgeous, and it is just right next to L.A. Also, consider you have the pier, which is also a must if you have children like us. Totally worth checking out, and to be sure, a fix destination in all my future trips to L.A.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fborrull

20,Not much to do,"i wanted to show my husband the Santa Monica Pier that I grew knowing. We live in Florida but made a visit to the other coast for vacation. So we went to the Santa Monica Pier in the morning and it was already crowded, which is fine. But there wasn't really anything to do. Some vendors and street entertainment ( I use the term loosely). There is a small amusement park but we weren't interested as it was foggy and chilly. Who wants to ride a Farris wheel in the fog when the whole idea is to see the ocean and you cant. So we were hungry and saw a restraint at the end of the Pier. We headed to the restraunt and went in. It's 10:30 in the morning and turns out to be a Mexican restraunt that only serves lunch and dinner. So folks were drinking margaritas and bloody marys. We were Hungary so we ordered anyway and the food was so bland we couldn't even finish. So we walked back to the car and left. Very overrated and nothing like when I was a kid. I know things change, I get it, but a tourist destination like this is going to waste.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danielfP867TF

50,SM bay wonderfully diverse in so many ways,"Santa Monica Bay extends from point Magu and Malibu on one side all the way to Palos Verdes Peninsula on the other. In between are several diverse and colorful communities to explore. You'll see tens of languages, see shades of people and hair across the rainbow; see tolerance, funky musicians, liberals, hippies, homeless, and even some drugs, through to hipsters, and gentry conservatives living in multi million dollar beachfront homes.The best way to explore is on bicycle since the bike path extends from Will Rogers State Beach Park all the way through to the beach communities of Redondo and Manhattan Beach. In between are the colorful spots of Santa Monica with the third street promenade, Santa Monica pier and the Palisades, heading south Venice Beach is a must see top attraction in Los Angeles. From there, don't forget Marina del Rey and especially walking along the breakwater of the marina channel. If you have a dog this is truly a place to strut. You will meet friendly people who live in this area with equally friendly dogs, and get a sense that this is a true community.Also, as a sailor, Marina del Ray is a fabulous place to charter or rent a sailboat, go fishing or parasailing. If you live here and have a boat I don't need to say more! Typical days have beautiful Westerly winds, mild swells, great sea life spotting's including sea lions and dolphins, and great coastal cruising. The adventurous should consider going to Catalina Island where there is snorkeling, scuba, and kayaking.The restaurant scene is equally diverse and fabulous, ranging from Malibu chic, to Venice Beach laid-back and funky, to just plain good eating!If visiting Los Angeles I suggest you stay in a hotel in one of the beach communities since there's so much to do along the Santa Monica Bay .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DrugDoc
30,Too much crowded,"Santa Monica beach is too much crowded, at the same time their are people who covers lot of area to showcast their talent.

Lot of small and big restaurants and street foods are available.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TeamOuting
40,So much fun and complete tourist attraction,"There's a magnet to visit Santa Monica Bay each I went to LA because I think it's a great tourist attraction...and everything's within walking distance. And I think it's a complete one: the pier, amusement park, the beach, the sight of Pacific ocean (especially at sunset time), restaurants (at the pier or streets nearby), the shopping area (at 3rd street promenade) even street entertainment by street dancers... Really enjoyed the crowd at the pier even if we only walked along the pier, especially during sunset time. Many restaurants at the pier although a bit pricey and almost always occupied. And when the night comes we could hangout at the bars and restaurants along Ocean avenue or do some shopping or just window shopping at 3rd Street Promenade.

30,Just to say youve been there,"Santa Monica is a very nice place. The beach is large and clean. The pier is average, if you've ever been to a boardwalk/pier with rides, etc then it will probably seem the same as most.

30,Tourist Popular,"I don't tend to recommend going to the beach at Santa Monica to those who are visiting. Mostly because it is already overrun with tourists and I don't think you get the real LA experience. I'd recommend going down to Hermosa or up to Malibu for a real LA local feel.But if you must go down there, there is a lot to do and there are lifeguards at the water and there are always a lot of people of all ages playing. Either side of the pier will be crowded.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kateoS8832HT
40,Had to visit.,"We were visiting LA over the new year and had to visit to say we had been there. The beach is ok but a long walk to the water from the shops.

30,Interesting place for short visit.,The pier and beach are famous but not necessarily any more interesting or beautiful than many other piers and beaches throughout the world. Access to the pier and beach was convenient and parking at $8 for the day was fair. Be warned - restrooms seem to be few and far between. I looked at the various signposts for pedestrians and found no mention. In the end I had to walk all the way back to the pier because I knew there were restrooms there. I think Santa Monica could do better in this respect.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SteveAC1

30,Mixed Feelings,"The town is full of good shopping and some restaurants which look worth a visit but when my late husband and I did spend time there, we were shocked by the number of homeless people sitting under trees with apparently "" no place to go "". When a country as wealthy as the USA does nothing to help such people to get back on their feet one does feel that there is a certain lack of compassion and empathy pervading such resorts as we found the exact same thing in Santa Barbara.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/littlebirdlondon46

40,Must be wonderful in warmer weather...,"Very nice in December, and see great potential in warmer weather. Not so many people when I visited in December-which might have been a great thing.

40,Santa Monica: the bay AND the city,"I love Santa Monica and enjoy spending time there. The beaches are beautiful, wide and white sand, very organized so you can enjoy the services (bars, restaurants, shops, ...) - I like walking from Santa Monica to Marina del Rey, via Venice, few kms on the waterfront street, few others on the beach. It is nice to stop and have lunch in one of the many beach restaurants (love eat with my bare feet in the sand) and then continue. Also at the sunset is very nice, you can imagine the sight. A little too crowdy in the week ends during warm season.I also disagree with reviewers that wrote that the city is not nice. I live there for a while and enjoyed it a lot. It is an easy city, with nice restaurantes and bars, nice shops, lot of events. I even liked walking the quiet streets to reach the ocean. It is convenient and close to everywhere in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andrem336
40,Good beach for strolling and sunset,"The combination of wide white sand, Santa Monica Pier, view of Santa Monica high rises by the beach is worth a trip to Santa Monica Bay. Strolling on the beach for sunset and listening to music on the beach gives you a sense of vibrant beach in the city. After sunset, go to a few nice restaurants on Ocean Ave or at the Pier or just trolling along a nice Palisade Park. To walk on the beach, you can choose to walk on wood path or sink your feet in the sand. If you go there by car, you can park on the beach. Travelers can use Los Angeles Metro (E-line) to Santa Monica (about 1 hour from 7th Street/Metro Center. Leave the city around 3 pm to catch the sunset and the activities on the beach and in the park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PrawetJ
40,A nice break on your way to LA-San Francisco,"A beautiful beach, but the city that surrounds it is not very interesting. It's mostly the beach. And it is a beach, a nice one, clean and wide.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/972LibertyHill
20,Santa Monica pier parking lot is nasty,"Trash, gum and condoms littered the parking lot. You'd think that the city of Santa Monica would make an effort to keep it cleaned up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/300stevem
50,The beauty of Santa Monica Beach and what it has to offer,"A beach you must visit when you go to Los Angeles. The beaches are so wide that no one can even imagine. As far as walking and cycling go, this beach starts as a boardwalk pavers for walking only, then there is sand. After that right on the sands there is a paved path only for cycling dividing from north to south and south to north . That is what makes it so compact.. the best part is the pier. The pier is also an amusement park with roller coaster rides games fairest wheel and lots of things to do. There's even a burger restaurant called Rusty's burgers right on the pier. This restaurant overlooks the ocean. On the pier there is something most beaches don't have is a first aid building for lifeguards on the pier. The water is cold though.. this is one of the best beaches in California and should be voted as one of the top ten best beaches in the world. A place you have to go to....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/buddhakouri
30,Fun for a short visit,"Best bet: go there any time but winter. The pier is a quirky, fun place to visit. The long pier is fun to walk while taking in the views around. Get a snack, fly a kite, take pictures or just have a good time with others. The day we went in December was wet, cold, and windy. didn't stay long.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lllly2015
30,Pretty enough but nothing great,Santa Monica bay is a nice sweep of beach but not a place to spend time at in winter. Nice pier but not as good as Brighton.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/86gregc

40,Nice place to visit,"We had a spare day in LA so decided to take a trip to Santa Monica. It was well worth the drive. We were fortunate to get the Black Friday sales so the shopping alone was worth the trip. Then we had a lovely wander down the pier, checking out the sites.Its definitely a nice side trip from LA if you have a car.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/addictedtotravel75
40,"really fun beach, although surprised by the trash","We were just here for an afternoon after arriving in LA before our visit to Universal Studios the next day. We didn't check out the pier, but could see the large Ferris wheel from where we were. The water wasn't as warm as I was expecting it to be in the summer, but the waves were great and we had a lot of fun. I was surprised though by the amount of trash all along the beach even though there are garbage cans also along the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sybwilson

50,"Wide, wide beach with glorious sunset...","Just walking along the boardwalk of Santa Monica Bay was quite something - walkers, joggers, cyclists, skate-boarders and 'skaters with townhouses to one side, sea to the other and then the sunset over the ocean - golden reflection with the life-guard shelters as silhouettes - wonderful experience!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jackie1961994
50,Gorgeous spot,"Very family friendly area. The Santa Monica Pier has rides ( ferris wheel etc) on it, restaurants. very clean . Safer than Venice Beach/ Muscle Beach area.

50,"Not only do movies and TV shows happen here....it is a beautiful long, well kept beach......","Santa MONICA is my favourite place in Los Angeles and a jog on Pacific Coast Highway with the Santa Monica Beach below a highlight for any traveller.Driving through and stopping at the Santa Monica Pier a great experience....plus don't forget a bike ride can be memorable and this is for sure a good family experience,so people are basking in the sun on the beach and jumping in the water-mostly cold-for my tropical taste.The views over the Pacific Ocean are awesome.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CFNordstrom
50,"A bit upmarket of Venice Beach, plus it has a pier",This is more family friendly (i.e. safer) than Venice Beach and has a pier with theme park and good restaurants. Its a lot more interesting than Venice anyway unless you are into hippy culture. You can stop here on a Starline bus orange route but if you have to change to the red route at Beverly Hills I'd recommend being on the return bus by 2pm in winter to avoid returning in the dark.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jafdip
50,Great Place to Watch People - Santa Monica Bay,We have been to Santa Monica Bay numerous times. Its a fun place to go to the beach.

There are iconic places such as the Santa Monica Pier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mini
50,Bike Riding Fun on the Santa Monica Bike Trail,We actually started our bike ride at the Will Rogers State Beach and rode past the Santa Monica pier. Was so beautiful and a fun ride! Then on another day we started at Torrance and rode all the way to Will Rogers State Beach - 44 miles down and back! Super fun bike ride and lots to see!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YancyFamily
50,Great Day Trip!!,We stayed at the Hilton LAX and they arranged a bus service which picked us up a 2 minute walk outside the main doors. Takes about 25 minutes to Santa Monica Bay. Was around $8 each with return and allowed you to spend the day exploring! Well worth it. You can walk along the promenade (watch out for joggers and bikes) and such wonderful homes you pass. Lots of quirky places to eat and everyone seemed very friendly and helpful. Fun day trip!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/swesterham

40,The Focal Point Of Santa Monica,"Whenever I come back to CA, I always go to the Pier just to view the sights and the people.

30,Disappointing,"3rd street is a nice place to shop and dine however the general area around the beach smells like urine and is brought down by all the homeless sleeping in the parks, not really a nice place to take the family or children",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traveler4052016
40,This is Southern California,"Can't go to Los Angeles without taking time to go to the beach. We found parking, pricy parking, and enjoyed a relaxing stroll on the sidewalk and then took our shoes off and walked down to the waters edge and walked there for a bit enjoying the sun and the surf and the seagulls. After we climbed up onto the pier and chose a restaurant overlooking the ocean and enjoyed a leisure lunch. Nothing beats time spent on or near the ocean!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/normh714
20,place for homeless,"Really disappointed. Beautiful place but there are too many people living on the streets. The restaurants are nice, there is free wifi on the streets but will not return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Trindade74

50,Leisurely stroll,"We strolled down the pier and watched all the activity going on around: street performers, people fishing, playing volleyball on the sand courts below, some people surfing (although the water was very cold), and the most interesting was some girls doing yoga on surfboards. There were lots of little shops to browse and coffee stands along the way. This was also the end of the famous Route 66 so we had to take pictures under the sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gajhicks
40,For being a city beach is really pleasingly,"Hardly bath temperature if you are not wearing wet suit like this in the month of November.The beach is huge and the advantage of its proximity to Santa Monica, you can easily walk to find everything the city offers. Significantly more peaceful than the neighbor Venice Beach",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Phayao13
50,Great Pier!,"Although being from Chicago, and one of the greatest Piers (Navy), I was impressed. Nice Shops, restaurants, and talented performers lined our walk to the end.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Avrin2
30,A place to tick off your list,We walked from Venice Beach to Santa Monica which was very pleasant and great to see so many people out and about. The Pier is very old world which possibly appeals to some but a quick look was all we needed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Passionflower200050
50,Wonderful,"Beautiful beach, the boardwalk is fun. You must ride the merry go round! And walk on the sand it's actually warm!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S1074CJmaryl
50,tI was just how I have seen it on TV,"Had a great day on the pier, walked along the beach. I couldn't get over the amount of rubbish bins along beach it was great to see,we should do the same in Australia. Great shopping.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Happy12Times

40,Good bay,My visit to Santa Monica Bay was on a beautiful sunny day. i went with my family.The sea breeze rushed through my hair. The sea gulls were flying around.there were not many people on the beach.We sat on the beach for about an hour and then walked to the nearby shops and restaurants. We had lunch at a restaurant. After that we walked around checking out the many shops. Then we returned to the beach.The sand is beautiful and soft. It was a day to relax and soak up the sun. There were more people in the afternoon - and a good time to do some people watching.Nearby is the yachting harbor and boats for hire.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mazmannan
50,Awesome view,"Such a beautiful beach.You can just sit over there, get a drink, take a rest.you can get there by taking the bus from the downtown.And there are shopping mall near the beach, you can go shopping after taking a rest on the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/huangw98
50,Just wanted to have a little fun..,"Thought I would head down to the beach to catch a sunset on a sunny L.A. day with temps. at 90 degrees in November. Lots of activity from the beach to the pier with a great diversity of people. If you do not like crowds you may be uncomfortable here but it is great fun and better people watching. Also, no shortage of ways to spend your money. The sunset was great and of course the traffic afterwards was bumper to bumper but still worth the afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/loesshawk2015
50,Great day out,"Such a lovely day out just strolling around people watching. There are a good few rides and food areas but they are very overpriced as to be expected. The ocean view and LA is amazing from the ferris wheel. The beach has white sand and when we were there it was not overly busy. Not many swimming, seemed to be more surfers. Loved it though, must go in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/227gracek
50,Fantastic beachland,"A fantastic place with the waves from the Pacific Ocean. A beautiful pier right out to Ocean. Lot of attractions, nice restaurants a the Pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peterbN7198JF
40,Famous landmark attraction,No visit to LA would be complete without a trip to this famous landmark. The food is rather average but the photo opportunities are tremendous. Shopping and eateries back from the beach are better value.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F1394XAgarym
40,50th Birthday celebration,Loved the beaches and Santa Monica pier. We went on the Ferris wheel it was fab we felt like kids again. We went for a walk along the boulevard to Muscle beach and Venice beach. It was great loved watching all the people doing there exercises.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JayneSamantha
50,Fantastic,Awesome place to wonder around and sooo much better than Venice Beach down the road. The pier was fun with the usual touristy things one would expect but it was so great just to walk and take in the sense of recent history surrounding the place.Do it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PatrickM79
50,Santa Monica is beautiful,"We stayed in a hotel right by Santa Monica Pier so spent some time down by the bay. Always plenty of hustle and bustle and very busy, but very beautiful and definitely great to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pulse16
30,Just another beach...,"We weren't overly impressed with Santa Monica Bay. Yes, it is nice, but there are much nicer beaches in Europe for a fraction of the price. We had a good time walking and chatting away, but it was nothing special.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/monikamS5482VS
50,You got to love Santa Monica,"I am not really someone who loves the beach but every time I am in LA I make sure to pay a brief visit to Santa Monica. I really enjoy the pier, especially in the morning when its not so crowded as in the afternoon. The pier has something magical to it that I can not explain - maybe its the fantastic view over the Ocean, the smell of freshly brewed coffe from the pier shops in the morning, the joggers, the view over the beach...The pier has great views of Santa Monica Bay and the beach, you can also see Malibu and Venice from there. The beach itself its huge and very clean. There are loads of shops, small cafes etc. its my favorite place in LA! Public transport is very easily accesible and gets you just about anywhere in LA. The Starline ""yellow line"" Tour also starts one block away from the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/19MJ74
40,beautiful spot,went here for the entire day with my husband and enjoyed the 3rd street promanade shopping and a walk onto the pier. it was a 34 degree day and we enjoyed a nice icecream and the views from the pier out to see and looking back at santa monica are lovely,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/buglesChchNewZealand
50,Grea Beach,Santa Monica Bay Beach is a great place to spend a nice day. The beach has clean and soft sand. There are Life Guards stationed and food is readily available. If you are lucky there are Wales and Dolphins not far offshore.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jgoldchain
30,Disappointing Overall,"We visited on a Sunday late afternoon and it was absolutely packed. Parking was difficult to find in their lot adjacent to the pier. The pier itself was wall to wall people. Overall, it was dirty (the bathrooms were awful) and seemed run down. We expected it to be as charming as it appears on TV and movies. Reality wasn't even close. Just seemed like an old carney. Bummer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrsW93
30,Quite a walk,If your traveling with a walker rollator don't waste your steps. This is a very small amusement area with rides and food. It would be nice if you got money to burn on children.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carribbeanmic
40,Nice place,"Nice to get away from the big city, Nice beaches and walks, Nice walk out on the pier and not to far from downtown LA, if you have the time go and visit this iconic beach",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pas66UKCan

50,Bike path,Take the bike path from Marina Del Rey and south. You can also start from the Santa Monica Pier. Only there's a long detour on city streets to reconnect to the bike path in Marina Del Rey. Hence the suggestion to start in Marina Del Rey and head south. The path hugs the water and is a great way to enjoy the beautiful coastline. Great for families or couples. Bikes are $20 for the entire day....one of our favorite outings!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shebaq
40,You just have to go,"Having got a free shuttle from our hostel, we spent a few hours on the pier, trying the big wheel and people and seal watching. It's a great place to while away a few hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Davethepubsinger

50,A Must,"A Must for the lovers of Sea, atmosphere and much more, a good walk to Venice Beach, Bubba Gumps and the SUNSET OVER THE OCEAN. Just perfect",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sirjoker
50,The Santa Monica Pier,"If you ever go to LA, you HAVE to see the pier in the day time. When we went, it was packed with all sorts of performers and entertainers. The performers, for the most part, were great. There was classical guitar, a really good R&B man dressed to the hilt in sequins, an old man doing a pretty good Bo Jangles, and even a magician doing card tricks. He was actually pretty good! That's just to name a few. We bought a CD from one of the guitar players. Nice memento of the visit.It was nice to stand and watch the waves run under where we were standing. The beach beside the pier had all sorts of bathers and body surfers. Remember, this is October! It was just all round enjoyable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sweetealeaves

50,A Fun Walk & a Great City,"Santa Monica, and the Pier is a 'must do'. Heaps of shopping in the city. and a fun journey out onto the famous Pier. Make sure you do the boardwalk between Santa Monica and Venice Beach, you might just see a movie star. I did! And dont miss the bargain shopping for quality clothes and items at T.J Maxx.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stewhunt
50,Love this place,"went by train from LA to Santa Monica for the day. A little chilly to swim but just walking along the pier and beach and seeing all the activity is a must. Plenty of places to eat, shop and people watch. Our 'Boys' (oldies) hired bicycles and rode down to Venice Beach while we shopped! ha ha they could hardly walk the next day",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bobkarenh
40,Old-fashioned charm on the waterfront,"Santa Monica Pier is a throw-back to the era of side shows and rides, cotton candy, burgers, souvenirs and -- these days -- Pokemon sightings. There is parking (on the slightly expensive side) right down at the pier front, and walking of the pier is accessible and easy.We were there on a non-holiday weekday when the weather was pleasant and the crowds were reasonable. An enjoyable walk around the pier offers an opportunity to shop, eat, have a drink, people watch, play side-show games (OMG they still have a working whack-a-mole!) and also walk along the waterfront on the beach.It's an easy and pleasant way to spend a couple of hours on a nice day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/binduAustralia
40,Santa Monica Pier,"Took the METRO from LA out to the Santa Monica Bay which was nice since it ended right near the beach. The walk to the beach, on the beach and the Pier was very fun. If you have an afternoon to take in this site I would recommend it. The pier itself was very nice to walk around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Monty_RTA
40,One of LA's more appealing areas,"Even in Autumn, this beautiful beach / bay is one of the better parts of LA - by comparison to the gridlock of the freeways, you can enjoy the views and almost feel peace and solitude here. Good for walking on the sandy beach or the footpath.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RonWamberal
40,Vibrant,"From the boardwalk and great pathways, to the beach, and the big pier, this place was hopping with activity and people milling around, relaxing and having fun.

40,Beautiful at sunset,There is a boardwalk to walk along the beach if you don't want to get Sandy. This is a good place to take pictures at sunset.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/715autumnm
40,Buy some water before go to the pier.,"The view was excellent, endless ocean and white sanded beach.and the park along the beach was very well maintained too.Many street performers at the pier so good to browse for about an hour.But at the pier, everything is pricey. Especially the water.$4 for one bottle of water seemed way too much for me.Make sure you have a bottle of water in your bag before head there!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Roving321334
30,Crowded,"Concerned at number of homeless, if you are in that position at least you would be warm. Some kind folks went round with food and clothes parcels.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/USAhols2014

50,santa monica pier,"To a cab from Hollywood Boulevard down to the pier for a day trip, It was such an amazing place, So many shops and things to see.We took a long walk down the beach along the surf and back to Bubba Gumps on the water for lunch, Then down the pier to people watch and check out the fisherman fishing and dropping lobster traps.Over all it was worth the $30 cab ride to visit such an amazing place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jayr30
40,"Nice vibe, lovely beach",We had a walk along the pier and spotted a friendly local sea lion at the end of the pier who seemed very friendly and happy to pose for photos.

40,Nice beach,We spent a few hours down at the beach. Good place to hang out for a while if you are a beach person,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/228Kevin
50,Lovely place to spend an interesting day,"We have just returned from a second visit to LA and both times Santa Monica Bay has not disappointed on both occasions, in fact we visited twice this time!!The shopping area is packet with lovely shops in a pedestrianised area and every where has a lovely clean spacious feel to it with lots of eating places for everyone's taste.A walk along the promenade is a must that houses arcades and children rides and some of the best entertainment singers/artists we have ever seen in all our years of travel - you can easily spend a few hours if not a complete afternoon just sitting and listening to them - we did!!! And even brought a CD off one of them fantastic!!!We parked actually on the beach front car park so we could visit the shops then walk back to the car to get our towels for the beach - which is just adjacent to the beach ideal spot",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/edwynag
40,A fun visit and experience,Recently visited on a Sunday afternoon when the pier was packed. My girls enjoyed the touristy shopping and playing in the water. It's not a relaxed scene but a good stop for a tourist beach visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/817katieh

40,Perfect for...Pokemon hunting!,"Came here on our first evening, wanted to go to Pacific Park but it was closed (8pm) but was nice walking up and down the pier. Lots of people selling curious items and entertaining the crowds. But as my title says 90% of people that were there was Pokemon hunting. Yes I said it. It was crazy. I live in London and I have never seen such a craze in such a relatively small area where you see everyone on there phones catching Pokemon. There is even a sign which advises everyone to play safe. Not going to lie I did whip out my phone and start to play and yes the reason why it is so popular is because you can literally get any Pokemon there in Santa Monica Bay.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LSP9

50,Great place to unwind and chill out!,Used the metro to come here for a few hours. Despite being busy it was a great way to relax and have a paddle in the Pacific and the Pier is excellent. Plenty of opportunities to buy a souvenir or get something to eat and drink and there are the fairground rides for those who fancy them. It's also the end of the famous Route 66!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LauraJLane
50,Don't Miss,Great place to spend an afternoon either people watching or having a delicious fish and chips dinner!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mack0613

40,"Free, Beautiful, Great Place To People Watch","The reason I placed four stars instead of five, is because you need to be a bit careful at night. During the day, it is a fun place to visit. It is a nice beach, execellent restaurants near by, and it's free to visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/7books
50,Lazy Afternoon,"Never really considered walking along a beach front as being a tourist destination or attraction but on reflection I suppose this particular beach front does hold an attraction to most people. After all this was the birthplace of Muscle Beach.Quite a laid back seaside atmosphere, all the areas along the promenade and beach path are well maintained and clean and to kill a few hours during a weekend afternoon this is a nice place to just hang out, take in a drink and watch the body beautifuls even if the typical Californian beach goer, nowadays, does not exactly match the stereotype.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jasejc
50,Great Vibe,Never get sick of visiting the pier. Just love the vibe and great feeling about this place. Great spot to just people watch,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/460sharonj
40,A truly American icon,"Santa Monica Pier is a truly American icon. A must visit for first time visit to LA. Just strolling around, watching people and the scenery.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DannyHS
40,Don't necessarily 'love' it - but it's kind of a must-see,"It's an important L.A. landmark and well worth some time to experience year another side to this overwhelming city. The array of experiences are unlike any other city I've been to. Pier is fun, if you are into these kind of things, but for me, seeing it and being there was the objective. Plenty of parking. A few restaurant choices on the pier - opted for Bubba Gump. Good sunset views. And worth hanging around till dark to see it all illuminated.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Harrison-F-Carter
50,"great fun for adults, kids, families!","Without a doubt, the Santa Monica area is a top destination for Los Angeles! Starting at the 3rd Street Promenade (there are many parking garages on 4th street), this 3rd Street is a wide pedestrian-only walkway that has been blocked off to auto traffic. Lined with shops and restaurants galore, with the upscale Santa Monica Mall at the South end, and with street performers (most have some talent, lol !) this place can't be beat for fun and sightseeing - day and night!Santa Monica Pier is a short 10 minute walk or 3 short blocks away toward the ocean coastline. The pier has arcades, rides, food, and vendors. More fun!Also, heading North from the pier on Ocean Ave along the cliff is a famous leisurely and scenic walkway used in movie sets. It provides a great view of the beach and the Pacific Ocean.About 1 mile south of the pier along Main Street is Old Downtown Santa Monica, which is another quaint place with shops and restaurants. There's plenty of pay-parking along a narrow strip that runs parallel to Main St.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cncyana
30,"Seen one, seen them all-","Beautiful day, which made it a great time in itself. Ubered over to the pier as the Getty was closed on Mondays, but didn't know it. Walked along the 3rd St pavilion and then out to the pier and along the path past the volley ball nets and sat awhile watching the skaters and board people. It was fun, but mostly because of the day- great for people watching in CA, but has nothing on our Ocean City, MD boardwalk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SOSMindy
50,Worth the stop,"We spent about an hour on the pier and really enjoyed it! We walked along the beach for a little bit and explored up on the pier.

The sunset was beautiful!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SNBingham
40,Fun in the sun on the pier,"The pier is bustling with a funfair, street entertainers, stalls and eateries. I recommend a walk from the pier to Venice beach along the promenade a pleasant walk of about 2 miles. Muscle beach for the athletic (or those who just wish to watch) is a couple of hundred metres from the pier. The sands of Santa Monica beach are expansive and uncrowded, a good day/afternoon out in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bexythepirate

30,Far West Destination,"We had to go visit the famous Santa Monica Pier while in LA. Area is just ok. Lots of homeless wandering around. The whole area could use a facelift. It's the end of the line for Route 66. Great views from the end of the Pier. Nothing to write home about but the destination was more significant as a traveler. Should you see it? Sure, but there's nothing special there other than some cheap souvenirs but the views are worth the trip",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/royw366
50,Lovely Natural Bay,I live near this bay. With only a few steps uphill I can view its wonderful half-moon curve. I drive along it many days and walk on its beaches other days. It is full of moods and colors and every shade of blue-green-gray. Somedays the waves lash angrily at the beach and others lie barely frothing. Whether seen from a vantage point up in the nearby hills or from the sandy beaches and waters edge it is an everchanging and always beautiful sight.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/212judif

40,Really nice bay,"Yup, it is quite nice. If you are bold and cold-resistant enough, you can even swim in the water (I personally liked it really much - and after few minutes in the water it is nowhere near as bad as it seems).

We also walked along the pier and had lunch at the nice restaurant at the end of the pier. Among other things the pier and area contain shops, restaurants, a large ferris wheel and other rides.

50,Pier/Venice Beach,"Visited Santa Monica in September 2016. A lovely place, with lots of shops, cafes restaurants around. The pier was really good, but our favourite was Vanice beach. It's a 45 min walk along the promenade (a beautiful sandy beach) or a short bus journey away, and has a fabulous atmosphere, with arty stalls and plenty of souvenir shops. Really enjoyed the street performers near the pier, brilliant!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KarenD60

The pier has shops, is wide and easy to stroll. The Amusement park is delightful and the best part of being on the rides is soaring over the ocean and seeing the surf roll in. The ferris wheel allows panoramic views in all directions. Definitely a must-see on a list of things to do on a short visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ILoveToRead

40,WHO DOESN'T LOVE A BEACH,There is no shortage of beaches in the LA basin and Santa Monica has the unique appeal of being so close to many diverse attractions. It is a long hike down to the water but worth the trip. We prefer to be on the north side of the Pier to enjoy the view of Malibu and south to the pier. Parking can be a bit of a challenge so avoid the lunch time rush.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SenorGancho

50,From Ferris Wheel to Beach to Fine Shops & Restaurants,"Santa Monica turned out to be one of the gems of our trip to LA. On the plane from FL to LAX we met a young script reviewer and started a conversation. He recommended Santa Monica to us so we gave it a try. People were so friendly, the weather perfect (no humidity), and the beach was beautiful. We walked out on the pier first and was pleasantly surprised how clean it was. Some of the street performers were excellent singers, especially the one in front of the main restaurant and behind it. Made me think they could have gone professional if they wanted another life than cool breezes, good food, and nice folks. Food abounds here as do little shops and many rides. We loved Santa Monica so we decided to stay longer and started to browse the streets. There were many restaurants and shops we enjoyed. A Promenade with name brand stores is part of the scene but that day we spent more time with the locals. We even enjoyed their library.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/267kar

50,beautiful but bring a sweater.,its lots of fun to either walk along the beach to the piers or to ride a bike on the bike path which can take you to Malibu or past the airport going south. But due to the marine layer it can be cold there or at least 10 degrees cooler than elsewhere in LA at a minimum. You can park on the lots near main street or try the ones on the beach. 6 hour max on the lots near main st but you can refill. Get there early on the weekends as it fills up. There are toilets and showers to wash off your feet from the sand. Water temp is nice right now.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sport5travel

You get what you expect to see. Yes it's very busy at weekends but this adds to the atmosphere, it appeals to all sorts, young, old...all having fun! The beaches are beautifully maintained, there is ample car parking which is not at all expensive.

Views are spectacular and you will see all sorts of locals fishing for the day, old-timers sitting on benches, children and people from around the world. Don't miss the famous entrance sign at the top of the walk way. You can park on the pier in the reasonable public lot. Rent a bike to bike to Venice or bike north along the bay for spectacular views. Plan to spend several hours if you have them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jashas2014

50,A must for Tourists and Locals alike,"Visiting the Pier has become one of the outings that I love. This place has a way of taking all of your cares and thrusting them into the ocean...and you will be glad it did. Upon arrival, take in the scenes...smell the food...enjoy the dancing and laughter and just let your hair down. Along the pier you will find an array of shops, eateries all of those staples that you've come to expect in a beach setting. The costs associated can be within normal range if you desire to just pack a picnic and eat on the beach and then perhaps walk the pier. That's perfectly doable. During the summer months (every Thursday) there's a free concert with well known acts, (e.g. Mavis Staples was there a few weeks ago, as well as, the Ohio Players) that will take you back in time when music was fun and life was easy...nevertheless, enjoy yourself. Have a great time and remember, life is to be enjoyed no matter where or what state you may find yourself in...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TbSott

That's probably because there's more to see and do around here. There's lots of parking, but, you have to pay, almost everywhere in this area. And, check the signs to see if the water is ok to swim or surf.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KentS297
50,Blackpool on Speed!,"If you've been to Blackpool, then you'll find Santa Monica pier familiar. Obviously the sun is out, and it lacks the scent of fish and chips carried on the bracing Irish sea wind, but at the end of the day the amusements and fun fair are the same as Blackpool!

50,great beach and nice pier,We stayed at this nice and clean beach for about 2 hours in the afternoon and continued on the nearby pier for a nice evening walk despite the crowds.

40,great place to enjoy,"There are beaches and there are Beaches. Have lived here for 35 years. There are very urban sections, wild and crazy stretches and laid back gems off the beaten path. Walking to the Marina jetty at dawn thru the Ballona wetlands is quiet and meditational. Mostly only the seagulls and egrets are up and scoring breakfast fish. Washington street pier is a joy in the early morning. The early surfers are out. Locals gather at the ""Cows End"" for coffee. If you want urban beachside mad-ness then Venice is the place for action. Each season and micro environment has its charm.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dziran

50,Santa Monica Beach & Pier -- Iconic Must-See Destination in LA,"Beautiful views from the Pier. If you go at night, and look northwest, you will see the lights of ""The Queen's Necklace"" along the shore. But try to time your visit to the Pier for sundown. That's when you see the symbols of Santa Monica -- the ridges of the SaMo mountains descending into the sea at the northwest mouth of the Bay, the sun setting over Point Dume, with the waves crashing on the beach. You will notice this symbol on all SAMO street signs and public works.The beach itself is pleasant and generally pretty clean, but is crowded on nice weekends (which is most of our weekends.) Be sure to come early if you want parking on or near the beach. Santa Monica has a great park system all along the beach.

Lots of easy parking in lots adjacent to the beaches. Good body surfing/boogey boarding.

40,Horrible and Glorious and part of the Definitive L.A. Experience!,"There's nothing like character watching, chotchkis buying, bike riding, and druggie observing on the strand at Santa Monica Bay. While the beach is fairly clean and inviting for sunning and bathing, the real action is on the strand that spans from down south at Manhattan Beach and goes past the Santa Monica Pier. Here you'll vie with rude cyclers, crazy weirdoes, delightful beauties, muscle men, and older tourists with gaping mouths in disbelief. In other words….the full gamut of life in L.A….be there or be square…and don't forget walking shoes, sunscreen and sunglasses. Welcome to Hollywierd!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eggcreamer

It was very busy when we visited(the price of fame!) The pier has lots of interesting rides, there are lots of food placesand souvenir stalls.

50,This is what a California Beach Looks Like....,"We were here on holiday from the UK and wanted to see Santa Monica Pier as we have seen it in many films and on TV. It did not disappoint. The town of Santa Monica is very pretty, and there was a farmers market on the day we went. The beach is big, wide and looks exactly like we expected, including the lifeguard stations!!Handy tips...1. Park a few streets away from the beach and you will cut your costs significantly. We parking in a city center (or centre as we call it in the UK) shopping mall car park and got 90 minutes free then $1.25 per hour. The beach cost was $12 up front for the day - if you can get in.2. Be prepared to walk. The town is lovely, we walked miles without realizing, and the beach is also great for walking the shoreline bare foot.3. Get there early. The traffic in the morning was tolerable. By lunchtime it was crazy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PhilipandSheena
30,Beautiful area,"We parked in a lot and it cost $8. We walked along the beach on the sidewalk, which was really nice. There are people roller blading, biking, skateboarding, running, etc. The sidewalk is set up for all these activities. There were tons of activities happening on the beach. We went to the pier and there was a free concert going on. We didn't stay for the concert, but we walked around. The pier is pretty touristy. The beach itself is beautiful.

30,Beware of street vendors,"Santa Monica Bay is a tourist site many come to by name only. Featured in many movies over the years, and in the 18 years I have lived in the area has changed a lot. What hasn't changed is the vendors trying to get you to buy cheap substandard items.Lots of trash on beach, but that is the fault of the beach goers.Not a big fan of unleashed dogs on the beach, especially when its posted about leash laws.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OpieT_12

50,Free fun,The Santa Monica Bay is not the cleanest beach but it is one of the few on California's coast that doesn't have a big decline from the sand to the beach which I appreciate. The pier is fun to take a stroll on and see the few businesses there including a Bubba Gump's restaurant. They also offered a Twilight Concert Event Series over the summer where bands would play for free up on the pier. There are lots of small nice sitting and park areas. It is blocks from a great shopping and dining district of Santa Monica where you can get better food and souvenirs than from the pier. This is the least fancy of all the beaches I visited but it was worth seeing and I good a good sunset picture from the pier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BargainHunter247

I would avoid it on very hot days because many people go and it will not be as fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LenaBalt
50,Pleasant walk and views,"Used the hop on-off bus to visit here throughout our LA stay.This was a nice distraction to busy parts of the city as it was cooler and more comforting being at the seaside.

40,Great to stroll along,An almost unending beach walk took us from Santa Monica all the way to Venice Beach and back.

For those who loved the two-legged sights, there were many beautiful ones there. I was, still am, an avid reader. There was always a book or two that went with me. The sun was kind and loving to me. One afternoon, I fell asleep on my stomach for about four hours. No sunburn, but a bit pink around the edges of my swimsuit, which faded within a couple of hours. Not everyone is that lucky.

30,Don't be too serious.,"I hope that all traveler don't expect too much on this bay because there are nothing too special about this bay.

40,"Touristy, but that's the point","Of course, you don't go to the Santa Monica Bay for peace and quiet.

50,WE LOVE SANTA MONICA PIER AND BEACH,Hey guys my kids and I decided on a quick trip to L.A we were upset it was so short when we realized how beautiful it was. We went to Santa Monica pier there was so many things to do and the amusement park was fantastic it's a must if you go that way. My kids bought everything you can think of hats jewelry painting we even watched a street dance that was really interactive the beach is just packed I mean packed we found a spot rented an umbrella and enjoyed everything the only downfall to my trip there was everything I got was either on snap chat or video that didn't save I have only 1 pic of the kids while we were having our lunch on the beach but have I lead you wrong in my other reviews? This place is a must go and bring lots of money because if your anything like me you want to come back home with the entire santa Monica goods the amusement park was worth the price I believe I paid 30 something for both for all day play they also have free WiFi on the pier. OMG and you have to take a walk up to Bloomingdale mall oh boy I can go on we can't wait to go back! Enjoy:),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KerryDezzy

50,Great Place to Stay,We had a day here along the beach area and eventually onto the Santa Monica Pier.What a fantastic area. The place was spotless and we felt safe here even though there were several obvious homeless people sleeping o the grass verge as you approach the beach.The Pier is like Blackpool's piers with the shows and a mini rollercoaster.There did seem to be a lot of British style establishments which made us feel homely. I really liked the place,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TamBlue

30,Hello North Pacific Ocean!,We escaped the horror of Venice Beach and walked up to Santa Monica. We crossed the invisible line and everything got nicer around Santa Monica.

30,Very touristy,"Don't get me wrong, I love Santa Monica Bay - but it's the parking, the huge amount of people (on weekends and weekdays) that just make me so ... angry. I would rather go to the 3rd street promenade than go onto the beach - unless I want to worsen my day.There's a water shower place near the pier so if you want, you can rinse off after jumping in the ocean. However, a lot of people rinse other things off too - like soda spills, dirty feet from walking on sand, and other things. Bubba Gump here isn't as good as others in Anaheim, so - all in all, three stars. Max.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nanita53
40,Rent a Bike or Walk,"Renting bikes and riding the bike path along the Santa Monica Bay is really nice. Bike rentals are cheap and have kids seats for little ones.

And it's always cooler at the beach, so great place to beat the heat of summer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaureenRiley44
40,Fun in the sun!,"The Santa Monica Bay is what you would expect from a world class beach. It has a pier with rides like when you were a child and there are food options and tons of sandy beach and beach volleyball. Lots of people and very active area. If you are looking for a more quiet beach location, just go north up PCH to Will Rogers beach and that is absolutely beautiful and much less crowded, but just beach and a snack shack, as opposed to Santa Monica Bay which is full of activity and people.

30,Interesting for a quick trip in and out,"While in Los Angeles on business we had a few hours to make a few stops in the area. We've visited the pier, more or less to say that we've been there. A total of about an hour to 1 1/2 hours is all you really need to allot to this attraction. A pier, a bunch of vendors and eating places with a few rides here and there. On our particular visit, it was a hot day, so we were not interested in spending more time at this location. I personally liked Venice Beach much better if you want to get a real California vibe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/greghY283TX

20,homeless,"Came from Pennsylvania and wanted to see the California coast - Santa Monica Pier was on our list - Went 7 oclock in the morning to see the morning sun and maybe surfers. I took a breakfast basket to eat on the pier to people watch with my daughter. Homeless people were all around us - One eating from a trash can that my 15 year old daughter couldn't believe. Another young homeless guy begging for money at the street light - 5 more sleeping in the park about one block from the pier. 10 morning waiting in line on the next street in front of the parking garage. We live only 10 miles from Philadelphia and see old elderly homeless people everyday but I guess with Hollywood entertainment - I never suspected this - so young - if anything to come away with was that my daughter got is a life lesson to see young people homeless and looking in the trash for food. No surfers, only people with their metal detectors and no sunrise during our whole stay in California with all the smog and haze in the morning.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/142joannet
40,Great location,Loved our visit to Santa monica beach. Rented bikes from just under the pier for the day and rode up past Venice beach and looked at all the stalls.

50,great beach!!!,"I went on the Hop on Hop off bus tour that got me to Santa Monica. This beach is beautiful, the water was refreshing and not cold at all. I would go back there in a heart beat. The waves were super high so you couldnt swim out super far but the waves came up pretty high near the shore so it got you all wet anyways. Beautiful view. The life guards are always on watch and supervised everyone well. The pier was packed and full of people and the rides looked super fun. There is fun for everyone there. I would tell anyone to go to this beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/matthewcV2456IZ

50,Beautiful & well supervized.,"Although the traffic is an absolute nightmare getting to and from this beach, its so very worth it. It is well maintained and that is likely from the very vigilant life guards and security guards. We went on a Friday and they were actively monitoring the beaches very well. We didn't run across anyone too crazy (a few thong bikini's, but no panhandlers or side-show freaks) and felt safe the entire time. There's a great selection of places to eat on the pier, so you don't have to lug a giant cooler of stuff, just a few drinks.Also, there are guys that come around selling umbrellas for $30. They are work every penny. We gave ours to a couple when we left, but we were there for 9 hours and that umbrella held up to the wind the whole day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sharberfam

Very disappointing - CROWDS of people, pushing, shouting, swearing, overpriced, over-rated, beach a mess with litter.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/336sandil
10,A Crowded City Beach,"Every tourist visiting LA heads to Santa Monica Beach and Pier. The Expo train from downtown LA just started running and conveniently and cheaply brings you within a couple of blocks of the beach and pier. The bay is huge and you can see north to Malibu. However, compared to how it was when I was a teenager, I think what they have built is incredibly ugly and it's way too crowded for me (except in winter on cold foggy days when there is hardly anyone around, except for the multitudes of homeless and/or drug addicts). It is less crowded if you walk to the north (most people head south towards Venice Beach). It is not disabled or elderly friendly. I think there should be more benches for people to sit on as well as grass and shade trees planted down by the beach (yes, I know there is a drought).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ladeela

50,We love to ride bikes on the path.,It is so beautiful to walk or ride bikes on the beach path. It is fun to people watch. We like to sit and watch the ocean.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kathleensN7968RG
40,Catch the bus! It's so easy and well worth the visit. Santa Monica Beach is gorgeous.,"We were a family of 3'generations, 3'adults and 3'kids under 12.We caught the bus from Beverley and Fairfax and the ride took about 45 min all for $1.75 ad and $1 child, with a great free tour on the way. We had a wander around Santa Monica looking for somewhere with a view for lunch and we're lucky enough to get a window from table at The Lobster looking down at the pier.After a wonderful and surprisingly affordable lunch for such a lovely place we walked it off by strolling around the pier and watching the kids enjoy a couple of rides. We then walked (well the eldest and youngest only made it half way and then flagged down a pedicab) along the beach front walkway to Venice Beach where some had E-NORMOUS icecream sandwiches, and others had a beer before catching another bus back to our hotel. Cost again $1.75/$1 .... A great and very affordable day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PennitDarwin

50,It goes on and on,"Stunning beach for the everyman. Lots of room to lay out and relax. Only one word of caution. When entering and leaving the beach, watch your steps for dog ""plops"". Some owners aren't as diligent with clean up as they should be.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/533iral
50,Great Time,"I was there with my boyfriend pretty much most of the week. It was summer and hot, so we would catch the bus for an hr just to escape the heat at home. Had so much fun meeting new people playing in the ocean, walking along the pier. Going for a walk down the promenade was fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/margief657
50,This is the reason I live here!,"I love the Santa Monica Bay and it is the main reason that I put up with everything else, the politics, the traffic, the high taxes.The Bay is worth it-to play in the waves and get my exercise there makes it all worthwhile. There are good showers that are free too. Learn how to dive into the waves before you go out past your knees though and I recommend a boogie board or shortie wetsuit and body surfing flippers if you want to go in the water for the whole week or summer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/54aliced
30,Not As Imagined,"You see Santa Monica area on TV, but it's not that great. Kind of cheesy pier and somewhat dirty and crowded. I doubt I would go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/98shanas

20,very crowded and alot of homeless,"We went there with a tour. We walked down the pier. There were a lot of homeless asking for money. The tour guide warned us about ""Medical Pot"" being legal. The odor was very present and people were asking for ""munchies for their Weed"".",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/N5263WGcarolr
50,Family friendly,"A family friendly beach with lots of food options from fast food to restaurants. Santa Monica beach is very beautiful, it's where bay watch was filmed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emmalee92

40,A stroll along the seaside,"Nice Beach, has a board walk to walk from Santa Monica Pier right down to Venus Beach, sand is swept every morning all is kept ready tidy, has lots of public toilet blocks and lifeguard lookouts. . Really nice to walk along in the surf too, so you can safely get your toes wet walking barefoot on the wet sand.!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SandyM-Wolf-Spirit
40,Santa Monica,"Another great place to see, however DO NOT GO ON THE WEEK-ENDS. So crowded, the younger generation might be able to put up with the crowds. Being of the older type we should have done this during the week. Lots of coffee shops, restaurants, but week ends hard to get a seat at these places. We went on a Sunday and we didn't even get down to the pier due to the crowds, but having said that it was a public holiday on the Monday, so may have been wrong time. But worth the visit. Again we took the train and so easy.Kristine de la Hunty",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kristine1950
50,Beautiful beach in Los Angeles,"Beautiful beach nice for biking, roller skating and just enjoying the beautiful evening. There are many restaurants on the pier with many street performers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sandraTPL
50,Lot's of People but a Must when Visiting LA,The pier is very crowded but it was a great to walk and play in the sand for a bit. If you are going to eat in the restaurants call ahead because the wait could be long.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KarlaStegui
50,Great place to catch some sun,"One of the cleanest beaches in LA, great people watching, water is clean for LA standards, great food and drinks nearby, 3rd st promenade is close as well",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/arash1111
50,A must-see,"Not much to say apart from: just go there, enjoy and feel like you are part of an american movie! Walk around third street for shopping and snacks and drive to Adelaide Drive for an amazing view on the ocean at sunset.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tamilde

40,It's worth a look,Well worth the stroll out onto the pier. Usual mixture of strange street theatre. Small fairground at the end.Great beach views.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/donnyMiltonKeynes
40,Another must do in LA,Lots of shopping. Lots of good eating. Lots of fun. Go here. Of course it's a must do in LA - why would you visit here without seeing Santa Monica Pier. Great for the entire family.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Navigate00230422899
50,Beautiful,"My children and I first time visiting the ocean ever and it was amazing and more then I expected. There are rides, games, food, and drinks for sale. It was windy and we couldn't find a parking spot the one we found was 25 and it was across the street. Other then that it was perfect. Walking through the pier and just enjoying each other's company and the water was stunning. There were a couple of rowdy people in the night we weren't used to that so we left. This is a perfect day trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vindes
50,Amazing beach and views!,The views in this bay stretch all the way from venice beach to malibu. Its a very wide beach with lots of room and a softer surf than some other beaches in the LA area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tonyh120
40,A fun place to visit,"If you like oceans, beaches, food and carnivals, this is the place for you. It's also the end of the famous Route 66 road, which I actually traveled a few years ago. The Ferris wheel is very nice to ride. It's on the edge of the pier and it feels like you are right over the ocean.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Teejaaa
40,Great view and relaxing,Arriving one hour before sunset is highly recommendable. Plenty of space and easy parking. Can be very crowded.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Michael_Wolf_Bek
50,Beautiful bay!,"There is something about the Santa Monica bay which will attract everyone with a young heart. Good place to surf, or just spend an evening with your loved ones.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Metahuman
50,A great side trip on any visit to LA,"There is something for everyone in the Santa Monica area, from a variety of great dining, shopping, and outdoor plazas, to the beach, which has great views of mountains and some cute harbor seals, to the Pier where route 66 ends, and you can do a variety of rides, get a ""sharknado"" picture on the ferris wheel. Plenty to see and do here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/450joya
30,Far too touristy,"As an Angeleno who grew up in Santa Monica, then ended up working in Santa Monica for 20 years after college, I can fairly say that Santa Monica Bay/the Pier and the Promenade are not what they used to be. Far too touristy, the big box shops have edged all the charming mom & pop shops and restaurants out of the way, and service in the restaurants is (for the most part) absolutely terrible - when they know you're here on vacation and probably not coming back anytime soon you're in for inattentive, unfriendly, non committal service and complete lack of attention. The exception to the rule - Ye Olde King's Head pub on 2nd and Santa Monica Blvd. that maintains a loyal ex-pat clientele and is attentive and friendly to all that pass through their doors. I used to play video games in the arcade on the pier as a kid, and have countless photos of me on the carousel. Santa Monica Place (the mall) seems to be built with only asian tourists in mind - all luxury brands, and mediocre restaurants. Better bet is to take a drive up into Malibu to enjoy everything that Santa Monica used to be, and is no more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Princessdreaa
40,Busy at weekends,I chose to visit on a Saturday and it was very busy down there. I'm not a lover of crowds so perhaps my score of 4 is unfair. Overall it was a very nice resort with good restaurants along the coast road and a well stocked shopping center behind. A few street performers as you would expect and well worth the walk over the wooded planks of the pier.I would visit again but on a less busy day,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S9914EWgaryh
50,An amazing and vacation-breeze beach,"If you have a chance visiting L.A., do not miss Santa Monica beach. This beach is very big and long. And you can see tourists here to enjoy the sea and sun-bath. There is also a Pacific Park here, and I think both children and adults can have fun here. And just a few blocks nearby, there is a street foll of stores and you can just enjoy shopping or wandering here. The atmosphere here in Santa Monica is leisure and ease. Just get rid of your annoying stuff and enjoy the sun and sea here in L.A.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yangor
40,Pretty.,It was overcast and kinda cold when we were here- I guess that is normal for June? The water was too cold to really get in too far. But there were still a fair few people there still. They were having some sort of a festival so there were a lot of booths and what-not. But they had entire blocks closed off in preparation. We didn't stay long enough to really see what it was about- due to time constraints. But even though we had to park a ways away it was okay- pretty easy to get back and forth.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kimwB1214HM
50,Worth the Trip if you are in LA,"Spent about 4 hours here, lots to see and do. Pier walk was nice, some entertainment and a few spots to eat as well as amazing water views. Ate at The Lobster, great service and food...would definitely go again....great view of the water while you eat. Shopping about a block back from the Pier was also fun and there were some interesting shops to view....no traffic in this area. Tesla Showroom was a treat for the fellows. The taxi ride was pricey from our Hotel but this was definitely something we didn't want to miss.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LoveLonndon
50,Fun in the Sun,"Santa Monica Bay/Beach is a great time. It is relatively clean and swimming is safe and there are life guards most of the year. The Pier is near--right next to the beach if you park at the Pier parking area, which I suggest.You will walk from the parking and in about 1 minute be on the sand and in three minutes be in the water. You can just lay on the beach, swim, or rent a bike and ride the very safe bike path. You can walk up to the Pier, which is so much fun or have a great meal or a snack.There is a lot to do. Tourists are welcome and it is a local hangout during the summer.Put all your valuables in the trunk of your car. Your wallet in your front pocket. The area is patrolled and safe, but let's be smart.Have the best time in Santa Monica.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elizabethlascheid
40,"Beaches, Blonds and Beer","This is one of the most beautiful beaches I have every had the pleasure to swim at. The water temperature was fantastic and we really enjoyed ourselves. After spending some time in teh water we decided to take a walk ont he pier nearby and it was a great carnival atmosphere on a Friday afternoon. The were lots of musicians on the pier, comedians and people selling interesting wares. While all the prices are touristy they were some intersting stuff available for purchase. While there are a number of rides on the pier we were not really in a mood to try any of them and we walked along the beach to end a perfect a day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thanesh2016
50,Fun for all.,"The Santa Monica Pier is a fast moving, exciting entertaining environment. Be sure to also take a walk along the boardwalk and to also walk on the beach. There is a lot to take in, but sometimes the business and excitement is just what one could use.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/525jenningsm
50,My favorite place in the whole country!,"I love this place. I would live here if I could. Best time ever, from the food to the entertainment. You never know what celebs you may encounter here either!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kalixts
40,Fun and touristy...,"Fun and touristy place to people watch, grab something to eat, rent a bike or paddle board, with the sun set, take a stroll.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wanderlust-n-south
40,Baywatch Locale,"Think Baywatch and you're thinking of Santa Monica bay, the home location of the show. While it is free to walk along the sandy beaches, parking (when you can find it) will set you back about $20. While it seems steep, there are many things/people to see/do here beyond the sun and the surf.The water is very cold in the winter, but is a lovely 70-80 degrees in the summer months. People are generally very nice without an abundance of creepy voyeurs checking out the young ladies/laddies in their swimwear. The beaches are fairly well maintained and lifeguard stations are present, but not always staffed. BTW, if you're looking for Ericka Eleniak or Pam Anderson at the lifeguard stations, forget it. These are professional paramedical, certified/licensed lifeguards who take their responsibility to safeguard the swimming public seriously. With the occasional riptide and undertows, we are lucky to have them on station.The Santa Monica Pier is a world famous attraction with carnival games, rides and shopping. If you want to eat something more than the usual hamburger/hot dog, there are plenty of trendy restaurants and additional shopping on the Third Street Promenade, a short walk east of the beach. Santa Monica beach and the Pacific Ocean is where the I-10 highway begins/ends. The opposite terminus is at the Atlantic Ocean in Florida.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/King_Bob_Rules
40,Great views!,We went in the morning and it was not as crowded. The views and beach are nice. There are restrooms and food trucks were parked close by. You can see where Route 66 ends. Later on in the day the area does become busier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hj99
50,"FUN, FUN, FUN!!!","If you're in Santa Monica bay then you have the pier too, where there's Pacific amusement Park, Ferris wheel, aquarium, video arcade, trapeze school, restaurants, entertainers, artists. Of course, there's the beach that's frequented by countless locals and tourists. Great ocean view and fantastic sunset. We had churros and funnel cakes for the kids and adults during our late afternoon stroll. Fun filled and enjoyable family outing with our house guests.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rosario308
50,An iconic must see!,"Definitely a must see if you love the beach and having fun. The pier has a lot to offer as far as beachy restaurants, rides, and games.

50,Best Beach in LA,Me and my Fiance visited this beach for a nice day in the sun with a lunch packed in our bag. The views offered at this beach cannot be compared to any other beach I have seen in California so far. The water is a beautiful blue and the famous Santa Monica Pier makes it look even better.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jacobh638
50,Rent bicycles for the best view of the whole beach and to people watch!,"A fun spot, a must see in California. Go on the ferris wheel...get lunch on the pier. The pizza is great. Way too many sights to name here. Lots of fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheSPAonKing
40,Lovely place,I loved my visit to Santa Monica. Really peaceful and relaxing day. We went lying on the sand glazing up at the clouds. Great way to spend the afternoon.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PHD580415
40,A must for everyone,"If you are coming to LA you must visit Santa Monica. The Pier is very touristy with shops and amusement rides for the family and a few restaurants. Right across the street is the Promenade with great shops and more restaurants to enjoy. It has a more laid back environment there and makes it a more enjoyable experience. We come here during the summer and year round as the weather permits. My favorite thing to do is just enjoy the beautiful views from the Pier. If you go, go to enjoy the views and people watch, its fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vee1050
40,Will go back,"We had the windiest day ever, it was literally freezing. I had 3 layers on me and still cold, the birds cannot fly up... imagine. However, on a sunny day, I can only imagine how great and fun this place can be. Will definitely return",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cymtl

40,Fabulous Atmospere,"Really enjoyed walking around Santa Monica Bay & the town. The place was really buzzing with tourists, bars, restaurants & of course, the beautiful beach. Great spot for people watching too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/197andyn
20,Overrated,"The parking is very expensive - 12$ for nothing, the pier itself wasn't thrilling as I thought. it's a tourist trap and noothing more and I reccomend to avoid this attraction",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/saar_teboul
40,great day out,The bay and pier is a great way to spend the day both with the beachside and also going on the rides on the pier and enjoying something to eat and drink. I loved the ferris wheel that went out over the water and spectacular views.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/678pattib
30,"Sorry, Angelinos, but it really isn't all that great!","Blame it on parochialism or arrogance if you like, but we spent some time there on a grey day when the Route 66 tour we were on ended right at the plaque dedicated to the iconic and much-loved Will Rogers. We then walked along the beach to the Pier and searched for a half-decent wave. We looked in vain. It must have been REALLY cold in the water because, although there were many people ""sunbathing"" (where was the sun hiding all the time we were there in 70F temperatures?) very few ventured in to the water. The sand reflected the clouds, grey and uninviting. When I think of our generally sun-drenched Australian beaches - now THEY are golden-soft and the waves are substantial to challenge most board riders- what we experienced on that one day was, frankly, dispiriting. We had previously stayed at the far more interesting Huntington Beach, oil rigs'n'all, and the contrasts were quite marked. And my parents lived in Santa Monica before World War II, so my predisposition was skewed entirely in favor of the suburb and its amenities, hence my overwhelming sense of disappointment that day. On the plus side, there was a very good range of well-priced restaurants, the Pier was interesting and the ambience was upbeat. Pity about the sun and surf, though...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mccorquinn
50,Pleasant Socal Beach,I enjoyed the Santa Monica Bay. There is plenty to do in Santa Monica and the Ocean is Beautiful. There is also a nice bike path that connects all the beaches near by which is a lovely bike adventure.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/petuniasprout
40,good place where you can spend half a day,"This is a classic location where you can spend sometime with kids and friends at the beach. Australian, dont expect this to be better than Bondi. It's different style. Aussie beaches looks way better, but the the atmosphere here beats it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alphaaaa
50,Beautiful!,"Head out here from LA and let the sea breezes blow away the town's smog. It's a beautiful place to visit and has a lovely atmosphere to soak up. The pier has often been used in films and feels very familiar to walk along and you can listen to musicians playing, hoping to get their big break by being discovered here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheReedies
50,Sun and fun,"Spend time on the pier soaking up the sun and atmosphere, ride the solar powered Ferris wheel ($8) then stroll along the beach towards Venice Beach, an easy Mike I r so.

40,A fun visit to the beach,"Before leaving LA, the wife and I decided to see the beach since we'd never actually done that in LA itself. I decided to come here because after living in Santa Cruz for several years I'd heard Venice Beach was pretty similar in weirdness, and wasn't interested in that type of crowd just to see a beach. Santa Monica was great, nice looking buildings, beach and restaurants. The pier itself was fun too, just wish we'd had more time for rides.The weirdest thing we saw that day was a guy holding a sign saying he liked rough sex, no joke. Otherwise a good place to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ajserrano1452

30,Beautiful beach and very busy pier,"A pleasant stroll from Venice beach and a glorious stretch of beach. However the pier and the town were teeming with tourists and quite unpleasant. Why oh why do they allow cars on the pier? The carousel is rather lovely, though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/U550YZsusanj

50,Peer Out Across The Ocean From The Pier,"A trip to LA is not complete unless you peer out across the ocean from the Santa Monica Pier - at Santa Monica Bay. By far, a wonderful leisure activity to do with family or friends - or solo just to ponder life.Be sure to plan a visit at sundown.Walk all the way to the end of the pier and sit in the bleacher seats - get your camera ready and take lots of photos at just the right time within a 2 or 3 minute time frame to really see the sun disappear below the horizon. It's wonderful.Be sure to take the nice walk from the pier south about a mile on the walkway that connects to Venice Beach (or you can rent bikes - that's really nice).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LenaHollywoodMuse

Lots of Beach goers Abit expensive though. Crowed when we went but surrounded by excited, unique and interesting people to watch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D5092GFjessicab
50,Beautiful place to visit for a day - very expensive off the beach though!,The beach was just beautiful... and up the road you'll find very high end shopping and delicious food.

50,Love This Place,"Santa Monica Bay is one of my favorite places to come and hang out at the beach, people watch, check out the rides and food on the pier and watch the seals do tricks for food.

40,Beautiful beach,"Stretching as far as the eye can see with lovely clean, wide sandy shores. Unfortunately there was quite a cold wind blowing so didn't fancy swimming but it certainly looked safe enough. I walked down to Venice Beach - no muscle pumping happening, but the beach walk was lined with cafes, shops, entertainment of all sorts and lots of interesting people. The pier also had lots of shops & entertainment but being shoulder season it wasn't in full swing.Well worth a visit & don't miss the lovely Venice canals.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annenewzealand

40,Santa Monica Pier - A Must Experience,"It is always fun to walk out onto the Santa Monica Pier and enjoy the scenery, the Pacific Ocean, and everyone having fun on the rides. Parking is easy to find on the lots near the Pier. The boardwalk has many places to rent bikes or roller blades. A great and scenic ride down past Venice Beach almost to Marina Del Ray and back to the pier. Rentals are reasonable, $7.00 per hour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sam4298
40,loved the pier,We went in April when we had some downtime while in California for a family wedding. $12.00 to park which being from Dallas I thought was reasonable. We walked the pier and the kids dipped their toes in the ocean. It was quite windy the day we went so it was a bit chilly but the boardwalk reminded me of the old Atlantic City I used to go to as a kid( I know it's changed tremendously). We ate at Bubba Gumps and while it is a chain the food was delish and our server was awesome. We didn't get to go on any of the rides but the carrousel made an awesome backdrop for pics.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JuneA241

50,OH MY GOODNESS <3,"-----The beach WAS BEAUTIFUL. It's a Californian beach, what did you expect? I was so happy to be there and the waves were very calming. (I didn't want to leave) The sand is not ""pure white"" but they do a good job on keeping the shoreline clean. I was able to do a little bit of yoga (I don't even know if I was doing it right LOL) and walk along the shoreline with my cousin; it was breathtaking indeed.Overall, if you are around LA, you must see this pier and beach.You will fall inlove when you see it, and will regret if you don't :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/800abigaili

Buskers played as we ate our lunch. It was fab.On our 2nd trip we hired bikes and cycled from Santa monica to Venice beach. An easy cycle- even in the heat.

40,"Beautiful, wide beach","We arrived on a cool, foggy morning in April, but still enjoyed walking out on the pier. There were many people sun(?) bathing on the beach, but it was a bit too cool for us. (We're from Florida.) Although the pier is a bit touristy, it was fun to witness the hype. Gorgeous views north to Malibu and south to Venice.Later in the day, after having lunch in town, we emerged onto Palisades Park to find the sun shining brightly. Sunshine significantly changes the feel of the place. The ocean absolutely sparkled, and the air was quite festive with street performers and happy tourists in the park. Santa Monica Bay was one of our favorite places to visit while spending a week in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CynthiaR379
40,Gotta walk it ....,"We arrived and headed straight down the pier, good views of the beach in either direction. We wandered around but we weren't really interested in the fair attractions. So just walked back!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clarao135
40,Large Beach & Pier,"Santa Monica is great. The beach is huge and wide, although the surf was pretty flat. There was plenty of parking and as well as the beach there is the pier with all its rides and eateries. We enjoyed the promenade along the top of the cliffs and down to the beach and the pier. A few homeless people were spotted but were not overwhelming.The main shopping centre was a short walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AntarcticBound
40,Song of the Ocean,"Just standing at the end of the pier on the Santa Monica Bay, (which according to the sign is the end of the original Route 66), is so relaxing and peaceful.

50,Mr C Thomson,Great family beach with lots of thing's to do.. It's a very busy beach with lot's of parking but be prepared to walk to the prom and eateries in the main area. Shopping center only a 5 minute walk from the prom with lot's of designer shop's and eateries as well as on the prom it's self. Defiantly worth a visit. Make a day out of it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/craigt710

40,Beautiful but no breakfast,"Travelling from Australia we headed one morning to Santa Monica to experience the beauty of this famous area. The walk to the pier was steep and not easy for my arthritic knees but it was worth it ,beautiful. Unfortunately we had only a limited time and had wanted to breakfast on the pier but nothing opened until 11am. A definite bummer.I wish there was a sign telling you there was access to the beach to the right.I had again a bad walk up to the road (my knees) and then down again to the beach. Could have done with more visitor info signs about other areas in Santa Monica.We travelled to our next location hungry and spent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/glambertanna

40,Evening fun,"Just like in the movies, it is indeed a nice place to visit in LA.

Street Promenade.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mariliafredini
40,Santa Monica,"We drove to Santa Monica from LA yesterday, the traffic was very busy on the way. It was a beautiful sunny day, but there was a hazy fog over the ocean.

Santa Monica was busy with tourists but there still appeared to be car parking spaces along the front.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Scotland2010

50,Great Walks,"The beach is really nice and there is a wide pavement so you can walk along next to it without getting sand in your shoes, if you don't want to actually go on it. Walk far enough and you get to Venice Beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ElliotHiller
50,A day in Santa Monica,"The shore is large and clean. I also liked the pier. Riding the old carousel was fun and reminded me of the movie ""The Sting"", in which it appeared.

40,Nice Beach,"We went to LA for Universal Studios but spent one day at the beach. Parking is right there at the beach and the pier for a fee of course, but nothing outrageous. Other beaches in LA I had been to can be very rocky and not fun if you want to boogy board. It was windy that day and surf was high. Made for a fun day. It was overcast too which was nice. There were a couple guys selling umbrellas, sand toys, etc that you could purchase and negotiate on price. There was also a guy selling fresh fruit, which I thought was nice but didn't feel I could trust it. Shopping was close by. Really like the location. It was a far walk on the sand though to get to the water. We were out of breath, ha ha. Had an enjoyable time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Plruss
50,Enjoying a stroll and the pier!,We walked along the beach and ended up on the pier. We did not ride rides but enjoyed listening to local music and spending time together. We thoroughly enjoyed our time. The Marriott-Marigot was a very friendly and accommodating hotel!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Brownies04
40,Weather dependant,We made the mistake of visiting on a Sunday when it seemed that everyone in the whole area was also visiting.We found a really cheap car park across the road which had a shopping centre in so got good vegan food too.The beach is very populated with people swimming and playing and is next to the Pier which is full of rides and new musicians of every style.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/julies_explorations
40,Should be a check in your LA itinerary,"I visited here at night. This beach is a celebration ! Although reaching here could be time taking if one is staying near Hollywood and hasn't rented a car. But a change of two buses and 1.5 hrs and you are there ! lots of vendors and artists crowd the pier. the walk is amazing , though little tiresome if one is wearing heels :) (because of the wooden path)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/507aditid

30,A beach with a pier - nothing special.,"Small souvenir/candy shops and restaurants on the pier. Nothing special. The pier at Monterey was much bigger and nicer. Seems like the merchants just want to rip off tourists, selling cheap garbage toys and candy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MichaelGorm
50,AMAZING,This beach area is such an amazing sight. A walk along the Santa Monica Pier is a must do as well. Preferably better on a non windy day. So much beach!!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kaysI7849ER

40,A day at the beach,A real interesting place. Arcades and ride for the kids. There is also an aquarium under the pier that people are not aware of. It is run by Heal the Bay. Very touchy/feely. Walk south from the pier and see all of the interesting characters at Venice Beach. A real people looking location. Would not recommend walking in the area after dark.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jacke625
50,Amazing walk by the beach,You can just walk on the beach here all day long. It is just amazing. There is also an amusement park at the end of the walk. There are also restaurants along the way.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cinesanky
30,I'm spoiled!,"I live in St. John, US Virgin Islands, so for me, Santa Monica Bay was a huge disappointment. I admit, I'm spoiled! While the beach was huge, the sand was mediocre; the cleanliness far from pristine, and the development overwhelming.Given its' location, I understand its limitations. However far more beautiful and lessdestruction of nature exist and deserve to be seen...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/needham
50,a great day out,"We absolutely loved Santa Monica. We began with the pier and a ride on the Westcoaster...I am petrified of heights so this was a massive leap of faith for me - so glad we did it, screamed my head off, but never again! Great atmosphere and people watching - we had beautiful weather, which really added to it. Make sure you check out the carousel as well. Santa Monica shopping area is also really great and on our return to LA stayed in a holiday rental near the mall, which was a great decision as we were flying back to Australia the next day and were nice a close to the airport.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlanaI_11
40,Family outing,"This is place is so much fun!!Took the yellow line, on our hop on/ off tour bus and spent the entire afternoon here. The pier is fun, from carnival rides, to local buskers trying to get known.For lunch, my daughter and i grab an hot dog, for the food vans, lining Ocean Ave.When then did the 2.3mile (3.7km) walk along the beachfront to Venice beach, to have dinner there. Amazing.Although the water was cold, my daughter loved it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FamigliaLaBella

50,I <3 Santa Monica Beach,I'm not sure why but I was captivated by this beach!! The beauty of the landscape; the sheer size and depth of the beach; the boardwalk and restaurant; the bike path and restroom facilities - and all of it public access!! We actually saw two seals off the pier vying for bait from the various fishermen. Too cute!! I'm definitively going back when it's warmer.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X9670UZlisam
50,Nice Spot for a Run,"Hit the beach for a run at about 5:30 pm when I arrived in town on a Tuesday. The traffic to get there was slow, as expected. It was a warm night and the place was crowded, but there's plenty of room to run on the boardwalk. Even sharing the walk with roller skaters and bikers.There's plenty of things to watch on your run as well. The sunset over the Pacific is awesome, but that's not all their is. There was a street hockey game going in the parking lot. A 2 on 2 sand volleyball match. And then there are things you don't see on every beach - a lady doing yoga on a pole about 30 feet up in the air. Guys bouncing on trapeze wires (doing some pretty amazing tricks!), and of course Muscle Beach.It's a great beach for people watching as you'll see every kind. Or you can just go for a good run.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeneseoSupremo
30,"Great, but crowded!","It's not that Santa Monica Bay is not beautiful, interesting or exciting. It's just very crowded compared to some of L.A.'s other beaches that are just as great.

50,Lovely down here,"We took a bus to get here which took a long time but the beach was lovely and the pier was really nice. We walked to Venice Beach from here, we were not impressed with the homeless people everywhere. It was in our eyes a dodgy area, but nice to have seen it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Expedition809666
50,Great fun,"We went at night and walked down the pier, rode the ferris wheel, and dipped our toes in the ocean. It was beautiful! The only thing I didn't like was that the beach was so filthy! I wish people respected it more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kayla_Chrisman
40,Good day trip,"Stopped here for the day after using the sightseeing bus tour, lovely big beach and iconic pier area which are great for looking around and for somewhere to sit and admire the view.

30,Trading on past glories,"We walked to the Santa Monica Pier from Venice Pier and the beaches are great, clean, well managed, surf and lifeguards but as the sun goes down the atmosphere changes to my mind. There are a couple of seafront bars with trendy people enjoying the nightlife that rub shoulders with lots of homeless people and as night fell I was glad that we were out of that intervening strip between the two piers. The lack of other pedestrians suggested that we were not alone in thinking that.The sunset was really cool and given the right meterological circumstances I am sure is spectacular.As it was we arrived at the pier in the early evening and there was lots of activity about but it all seemed somewhat tacky and a little down at heel for my tastes although photographers will enjoy the photo ops. I suspect that at the weekends the atmosphere is different but on a Monday international bad night out we were disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TripMember020920162
40,A nice sunset but a bit crowded,"We stop by for couple hours at Santa Monica Pier and walked down the beach. It is always a nice place to visit, but felt a bit crowded. Parking was another challenge here too, but were able to park by the pier. Of course it is not cheap, but what is cheap in LA?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MyFavoritesPlaces

30,Just OK,"Nothing special, a nice walk but nothing more interesting or exciting. Not sure we'd go back- though we could see the attraction for teenagers @ night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Naldo2337
50,What an Experience!,"Visiting Santa Monica Pier was fantastic. Just walking up the pier, taking in the atmosphere - weather was perfect - it could not have been a better experience.

40,gets pretty crowded but the pier is still ok kind of,Its good to spend some time on the west side of los angeles and if you don't like the craziness of Venice beach this is more civilized and the area of Santa Monica that used to be called the People's republic because of rent control and a socially conscious management has gone very commercial and is relatively disappointing now as the shops have upgraded and look mostly empty because of that.....!!! Free parking if you are going to shop,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/donaldr645
50,Amazing and Awesome,No doubt Santa Monica beach is called as one of the best beaches in the world.... The water here was critical clear... The weather was lovely...

40,Perfect at sunset,"Santa Monica Bay/Pier is a must see if your travel takes you to the greater Los Angeles area. We went late afternoon and stayed for several hours. The sunset and scenic views were great to just relax and take in. The pier is full of typical tourists trap spots, but random musicians and performers can normally be found as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MattTX1836
50,Had to ride the Roller Coaster,Fun beach with an amusement park on the pier. Of course my 15 year old and I had to ride the roller coaster.

40,A little bit of old school LA,"We had a quick stop on a city tour at the pier here, it reminded me a little of the pier in Brighton UK.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kimkath61
50,Fun and Frolics on the Peir,"A great experience for Couples, Families, Children, Pensioners and anyone enjoying the buzz of the fairground and the atmosphere of the seaside! Some great restaurants, although can be quite pricey, but you're paying for the location and the view. On one of my visits here, we stayed until the evening, and at dusk a group of people lit thousands of candles on the beach, just off the pier. I'm not sure what the purpose of this was, but the effect was amazing and it really did look beautiful. It added to our experience of the Pier. Also should say we got great enjoyment from seeing the authentic LA Cop Car, complete with 2 authentic LA Cops was brilliant! We even took a picture of them!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JennyWinkleToes
40,Lots of fun for the family or group of friends!,"As the title says: This place is great for a group of friends or families to walk around.

40,"Beach , Pier and 3rd St","""SAMO"" is a unique area with these three things with in easy walking distance. BTW the warmer the day the better the crowds. The beach is usually nice and the ocean always great for a ""dip"". The pier has attractions and rides from dawn to dark. The people and crowds are from all over. Excellent people watching and lots of reasonable food choices too. 3rd street promenade has shops and restaurants galore. Always a bit pricey but really good for window shopping. There are also street entertainers everywhere too. Hit all three and you can be there for several hours easy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tlakeusa
50,Loved it,"Worth the visit. Make sure you check out the Bubba Gump, and hotel California while here. Always sunny in California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChicTravelAddict
40,Classic pier/beach side,We went to Santa Monica beach after a 12 hour trip from Australia. It was a good way to start our holiday and the pier was just like you see in US shows/movies. It is the end of route 66 and is a bit touristy. Didn't the beach was as good as home but the toilets were very clean and well kept.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rykony

40,"Nice View and Rides,but too crowded in the afternoon","Paid a swing-by visit at the Santa Monica Beach on a weekend before heading back to San Diego, and I find it to be too crowded and packed with people on a weekend, apparently. It offers a nice view of the Pacific Ocean and a long beach where people are lounging around to sunbathe or swim.The Pier offers a free exhibit about the history of the wharf and has a few restaurants for food and refreshments. And there's the typical carnival rides which actually describe the Santa Monica Pier, which may cater more to the kids and teenagers though ridership also applies to some adults, whom I presume were mostly tourists.The best thing is it is of walking distance from the Palisades Park and the Promenade which is packed with performing artists and brimming with shops, cafes, restaurants and some theaters as well as malls.I reckon a visit is nice at dawn or daybreak, just like the scenery as seen on movies and tv shows that showcase the Sta.Monica Pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Scrattie

Happy people, so much fun going on and the clean, seemingly endless beach. Don't miss the sun setting in the pacific. The day i visited, a great sitar artist was performing at the pier. Melodies coming out of the Sitar, cool pacific breeze of a December evening and red, crimson hues of the sky. only one word- magical. :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gpindia

40,Pier is must see - especially at sunset!,"Spent the afternoon driving over to the pier. Arrived late afternoon, and after struggling to find parking (not an easy task) - walked the boulevard and out on to the pier. It's a lot to take in - full of many characters, colors, and opportunities. The performers there were another story in themselves, but very entertaining. Didn't eat or drink anything there - but found everything exciting. Would highly recommend a sunset view from there - breathtaking!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JayhawkJim

20,You can do better for a beach experience,"I'm a beach snob. Not a hideously uptight snob but wound up tight enough to say that Santa Monica Bay is a not a great beach. And I do not like Malibu either. If you really want to go to a beach, get in the car take the coast route down and go about 20 minutes south to South Bay. Go to Hermosa or Manhattan Beaches. The water is cleaner. The waves are more fun. Less traffic than Santa Monica.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TracyHawaii

50,"Sand, surf, sights and sea","The beach is clean and wide, the sea cold but inviting. It was crowded on the weekend, but thinned out during the week.

50,I Do a Conference Call Every Thursday From Will Rodgers Beach,"With ample but often expensive parking, you too can enjoy the same beaches that the bikini-clad ladies (and the Hoff) pranced around on during Baywatch.There are great walking and bike paths. You can sneak your dog down to the beach when its not summer and nobody is looking.Look for the trailer park on the cliffs as its the most expensive of its kind. $1,500,000 for a double wide!!! Amazing.Don't be shocked to see sea otters, big ocean birds like Pelicans , and dolphins. I once saw a whale breach about 500 yards off the coast of the beach in Pacific Palisades.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FlyersFanInLA
50,A little piece of paradise!,"There is something extra special about the Santa Monica area - the shops, the people, the quiet. The best place to get away from the hustle and bustle, explore the beach, read a book, walk in the shops or explore the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TimothyJ746
50,Top favorite place... some warnings...,"I love Santa Monica, the beach, the pier, the Pacific Park, the strand especially. What a great place to bike or roller blade. However, DO NOT leave your bike unattended. There are a lot of thieves watching you lock your bike and if it's worth any money, they're happy to unload it when they see you head off for the water. I see some people lock bikes but take their seats off and carry it with them. That's one way to possibly avoid this problem. They may LOOK like a thief if they steal a bike with no seat. Makes for a tough getaway. But in general try to keep it with you if possible. They have cutters to cut right through the locks. Muscle Beach is a great place to watch people work out or do special acrobats. The swings are nice. Fun area with lots to do and a great variety.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mikki777

There were a bunch of people fishing off the end of it so be careful of their hooks if they don't know you're walking behind them! Walking back down a violinist had set up and was playing for the crowd, great to hear! There are tons of people selling cut up melons for snacks and can get to be a little annoying but they are just trying to make money to live like we all are.We rented bikes for $20 a day (or $7 per hour) at the start of the pier and cruised down the boardwalk to Venice. The boardwalk is great, very busy on the weekend afternoons so be aware of others, the morning was pretty quiet.The original site of Muscle Beach still has the gymnastic rings and has posts people set up hammocks and slack lines on.

We lazed on the beach in the sunshine, ate frozen yogurt and rode the rollercoaster on the pier (in the front car, and we got a second ride for free :-) ), then had lunch at a lovely restaurant opposite the pier. We then walked down to Venice Beach and took in all the sights and sounds, and also wandered around the canals (look out for the super cute hummingbirds!), before wandering back up to Santa Monica. Lovely day in LA :-)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lissy2904

40,Iconic destination,"The pier is a place I have always wanted to visit and was worried it would not live up to expectations. The walk from Venice Beach to Santa Monica was eye-opening with people accosting me every 2 minutes for money or listening to music. Once I was past the shopping precinct, the pier was in sight and I was happy that it met my expectations. Lots of colour, people and great things to look at.

50,A great place to visit for a beautiful sunset,"We went to Santa Monica for the evening. We were able to see a beautiful sunset, and enjoyed walking along the board walk to Venice Beach. We also went onto the pier and went on a ride or two. The ride tickets are quite expensive, it is better to buy a pass, but we only wanted to go on one ride before dinner.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travellaur394
50,Santa Monica Bay,"The only problem with the bay is that the distance from the start of the sand to the ocean is too deep. You feel like Lawrence of Arabia without his camel making the treck. Doubly worse if you have a lot of ""stuff"" to schlep along with you. Also a problem between the Venice Pier and the Channel as there are no convenient public restrooms.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/144sidm
50,One of my favourites in LA,I'm a Santa Monica lover through and through. The pier is fantastic fun and looks amazing at night when it's all lit up. One of the best places in LA to watch the sunset. Hiring a bike and riding to Venice Beach and back is one of my most favorite all time things to do! There are quite a few homeless around the pier but they are generally harmless. Lots of great restaurants around also.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ElleHerd
50,So much fun!,"The Bay was great. Although it was a little crowded the day we visited, the beach was still fun and enjoyable. It looks prettiest at sunset. It is fun to wade in the water and spend time tanning on the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/le0l0vest0travel
50,Walk on the Pier,This was quiet at the time we went. I have enjoyed this when it was really busy too. The atmosphere is upbeat and very unique. I like seeing the looks of the beach in person since I had only seen it on movies and shows before. Everyone should experience this area at least once.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/509cheriw
50,Disapointing,We planned to eat here and spend some time on the Pier. In reality the pier is rough bolted down wooden planks. I could not roll my wheelchair over it without bouncing painfully along. It was not worth it. We left,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrd102
30,Bubba Gumped,"Sadly, there appears to be nothing remaining of the buildings or architecture from the original pier of the 1920's. Of course, the same can be said of NYC Times Square. Like Times Square, the pier is noisy, crowded and over-priced ($6.75 for ice cream at Pier Burger). The stairs behind Bubba Gump lead down to Santa Monica beach, joining nature and commercialism at the hip. It's remarkable that an up-scale community like Santa Monica with its premium shops and exotic car dealerships has a pier and beach comparable to Coney Island. Joey Chestnut of Nathan's hotdog eating fame would feel right at home here provided he mortgaged his apartment to pay for the price of dogs. Nearby Venice Beach is the better choice of beach and boardwalk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/979stevent

40,"GREAT PLACE TO BE, LOVELY RESTAURANTS","Many people but happy people, all cycling, running, jogging or just walking slowly to look at the scenery. Let me tell tou about a nice restaurant : SHUTTERS on tjhe beach. Sitting inside the restaurant but on the sand. Nice food, nice staff, shame it was on my last day sunday 24th of January. 4 days later, here in my house in the country east of Paris, under the grey sky and the rain I miss Santa Monica, Malibu and Beverly Hills.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LONNOY
30,You really have to WANT to go into the water.,"Let me preface this review with this - I am from Hawaii, where the ocean at the very least is blue green, at it's best - glassy an blue. And if you're outside of Waikiki, the sand is clean, with out chalking up your feet. With that said, Santa Monica is average.Here are some of the not so great things:1. Don't come here from the warm water. It's non-exsistant.2. Parking can be a nightmare if you don't get there early; especially during the summer.3. There is quite a bit of homelessness.4. There are no palm trees near the coast line.5. The sand is a bit chalky.Here's some of the good.1. Lots and Lots of eye candy. Volleyball players, surfers, bikinis, etc.2. A great walking and bike path.3. You can catch a celebrity or two working out and the jungle gym.4. Santa Monica Boardwalk.5. Hot Dog on a Stick.Depending on what you're really after, will directly depend on your expectations of Santa Monica Bay. It's not Tahiti, The Carribean, or Costa Rica, however, if you're looking for novelty, then, you may enjoy a day at Santa Monica Bay",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joycelynnq
50,Views are breath taking,While in LA you simply must take the PCH1 and drive along the Pacific. Santa Monica Bay is simply stunning as is a little further Malibu.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brooker813
40,Worth a visit,"I enjoyed wandering around Santa Monica with lots of shops and good restaurants. The pier is worth a look but very touristy - Bubba Gumps, souvenirs and more trashy souvenirs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MG862

Well then, pay to park close by and be prepared to file a police report!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z8087FSmarkr
50,"Clean Sand, Great Entertainment","We had a few hours to kill so we decided to swing by and see what the Pier was all about. We arrived about 9am and the Pier did not officially open until 11am so we hung out down at the beach for a couple hours. We parked in the lower lot which at that time of the day still had plenty of spots available. The sand was clean and it was not crowded at all. There were people performing music up on the Pier and you could hear it down on the beach. That made for a cool atmosphere. Once we went up to the Pier we just kind of leisurely walked around checking everything out. There were a few vendors selling art, clothing, and jewelry. A few people had set up shop in different locations of the Pier to provide musical entertainment. We didn't ride any of the rides since it was a bit pricey, but all in all this place was pretty cool. A nice hang out especially if you are a people watcher and want to just chill.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeniferM770

40,Good atmosphere of family fun,"With free entry to the pacific park, it's great to enjoy the atmosphere here even you do not take the ride. Beautiful settings and unlike any other beaches it looked more like a fun place beside a beautiful beach instead of simply a beautiful beach. Magician, food stalls, street circuses and beggars all scattered around",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alholdings2008

There's eateries all about. Very LA!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/highlyselective
50,Happening Town By the Sea,"I used to work above 3rd Street Promenade in Santa Monica. There were many shops and restaurants that were an elevator ride away and the beach was 2 blocks away. The pier has many amusement park attractions. You can arrive in the late morning for some beach time, see a movie, have dinner, and check out the pier in one full and not all that expensive a day.

30,Just a beach,"I was not thrilled about it, maybe because the only thing you can do is just walk on the beach and pier.

50,Amazing during evening hours,"We visited the Santa Monica Bay area and Pier and it was so full of love with all the light works and live music in evening. Very romantic.

30,sandy beach that stretches for miles,"not much to say about this place, it is voted as top attraction when in L.A., but coming from the country with really beautiful beaches (im not being bias) this one doesn't struck me as something special.There is a pier on the beach on which you can buy souvenirs and grab something to eat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlobeTrotter_x80x

30,obvious beauty but is it safe for all?,The pier is a must see and has something for everyone. The natural beauty will take your breath away but the vagrants and thugs hanging out by the pier can be alarming. I actually saw fours vagrants fight each other right in the street. The police really don't seem to care. Be careful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/787sully

50,Beautiful and fun pier!,"We visited Santa Monica Pier on a beautiful December day, it was a fun time for all of us even thought we didn't ride the rides at the amusement park.

There is a solar powered Ferris wheel (only one of its kind), roller coaster and other typical rides you would find at a small scale amusement park.

50,Especially nice when it's not too crowded,"While our daughters enjoy the rides, we just like the ambiance. At the end of pier there was a large seal lolling in the water and checking us out. I think he was hoping for a handout. The quality of the street musicians on the pier is surprisingly good, but most people are too busy walking to stop and listen.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davemh333
50,Must see.,"If you are visiting Los Angeles as a tourist, you of course must come here to see our beautiful Santa Monica Beach. There a boardwalk and bicycle path, but you can also walk along the shore for miles. You can walk and walk until you even reach Venice Beach or stroll toward Malibu. Bring bread to feed the seagulls.

40,Parkour and Acrobatics,"My son goes to Santa Monica beach, south side of the pier, regularly to practice parkour. This part of the beach is popular among parkour enthusiasts, gymnasts, and acrobats for the offerings at Muscle Beach Santa Monica. There is an area for slack rope walking, an area for tandem acrobats doing handstands on top of one another, and various gymnastics equipment. If you're a tourist, it's an excellent place for people watching on weekends, as you can see people flipping, swinging on rings, balancing on top of things, and possibly recognize American Ninja Warrior contestants.The beach itself is broad and relatively uncrowded, considering it's one of the most famous tourist attractions in Los Angeles. Once you get a couple blocks from the pier, there aren't that many people on the beach itself or in the water. There are more beachside shops for buying t-shirts and sunglasses a mile down in Venice, but there are also plenty of stores and restaurants nearby on Main St. or at the Third Street Promenade.On normal days, ample parking is available at a reasonable rate at the Santa Monica Civic Center parking lot. It's cheaper than parking at the mall and any nearby meters. When the weather is lousy, you can usually find parking in the small lot on the north end of Appian Way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/541DavidG541

It seems that almost every waiter or waitress you meet , is an inspiring actor :) The Area has many fun places to drink, eat, shop and people watch. I love people watching on the board walk to the sand. So many people, from so many places. It's like a special spot away from the plastic masks city of L.A. You don't have to carry a Louie purse to fit in in Santa Monica to fit in. I have been to the L.A. area many times and I keep on going back. The brown you find here... is the sand between your toes!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/beachpirates3
40,Even in foggy weather it is a place you have to see,"Well, it was fog @morning but have to see Road 66 end point which is located here. We have park in the Santa Monica town parking house but there is a big parking on the beach as well. We did it in the city as planned to do some shopping later. But if you do that (not shopping but parking) and approach to the beach by walk you can enjoy very biec views on the beach from the walk.Pier itself is very big, at least what i've seen. There is a sing of Road 66 and at the end a shop related to Road 66. Lot of stands with souvenirs and food, but beside of it, not much interesting. Just enjoy the view and place where you are.

The beach is large, but I can imagine it fills quickly. It was a shame there was so much litter everywhere. You'd think CA would be better. We waded into the water, and man, was it cold! I knew it would be but just had to dip my toes in the Pacific. It was very fishy smelling that day.

It was getting close to dusk so major rush to get photos. We walked down to the pier and looked around all the attractions, had photo taken with the Route 66 sign and police cruiser among many.

40,SEE AT LEAST ONCE,I was particularly impressed with a boardwalk on the sand for disabled people. The pier was old world style entertainment with the ferris wheel and trapese artists.

40,Nice beach,This beach is a nice place to go for a stroll along the beach.The beach is clean and we had a lovley walk along the sea to the peir.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Natp44
50,Enjoyed a day in the Sun at Santa Monica Bay Beach,We traveled by public transportation to Santa Monica Bay Beach. I was a hot day but there was a breeze. We only put our feet in the water and it is cold. Note: you have to walk down a steep hill to get to the beach. Walking up would be a slight problem for those with walking issues.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ladyaries100
50,Beautiful sunset and you can tell exercising is a lifestyle there,"It was a cloudy and drizzling day when we visited the beach. It was quite windy there. People were doing different sports, such as yoga, etc. You could tell it's simply a lifestyle of L.A. We were wishing to watch the sunset, so we kept praying for the sky to get clearer. It didn't, but we still got to see an amazing sunset. Wonder what it would look like when it's all clear.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/913fionaw

The pier has some shops and a few places to eat but I thought the highlight was the Ferris Wheel. When you begin to go around on it you get an amazing view of the pier, the town and the beach and they let you go around quite a few times so you can get pics. The beach was nice. The sand was clean and the water clear. We had a great time. FYI: it is very touristy and crowded and most of he food is fast food.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarliTravels

There are so many beached along the coast that are so beautiful and fun to enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adac1121

30,Santa Monica,"Glad we went here but it was surprisingly grotty with lots of homeless people lying around. We arrived quite early in the day (about 9:30) and have heard that the place only comes alive around midday. Maybe if we had gone later we would have enjoyed it more. Was good to see the iconic muscle beach, the skate bowl and the pier though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanielleMark
50,Keep your eyes open and you wits about you!,"The Bay is stunning and the walk from Venice to the Santa Monica Pier, really gives you an insight of what going on, but make sure that you keep your eyes open and your wits about you, as an American Smile may cost you more that you bargained for!

50,Santa Monica Has it All,"I come to Santa Monica several times a year. It is one of my favorite places on Earth believe it or not. Mainly because it is close to home but it has everything I love. The beach is phenomenal, the playgrounds are great, The Pier! With all the rides and food along with countless events throughout the year there is always something to do...and if you like to shop there is world class shopping and dining within walking. The views are amazing. The only thing that I would say is that sometimes the water is not safe to go in and they put signs up...With such a large amount of people close to the coast, it's no winder why....but I still give it five because the water is usually not where I hang out and when I do, I just go down towards Venice or up to Malibu where its secluded.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danzaviva

50,Great afternoon,"What a great way to spend an afternoon! If you're staying in downtown LA take a taxi to the Santa Monica Promenade and walk to the Pier. Besides the shops and restaurants you'll see various performers and musicians. Catch a cool breeze on the pier, ride some carnival amusements or watch planes from LAX take off into the sunset. Great for families, friends or a romantic stroll.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/573lizt

The pier is obviously the best attraction, it has an amusement park, restaurants, gift shops, and there is a lot of people from all over the world. Since many tv, music videos and movies have been filmed here, my friends from out town enjoy it much more when I show them the spots where these were filmed and they take a picture there.

50,Best Tamales,We arrived in Los Angeles from New York and immediately went to the Pier. We took all the iconic photos and parking was easy to find not that far away. There were tons of food vendors and we ate the fresh tamales we saw right on the pier. Clearly its also a place for children as there were swings and things for them to do on the beach. I didnt have my son in tow but its on his list of places to visit next year.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stayinyourlane123

We spent the day just wandering the shops and walking along the pier which is a real carnival atmosphere. the Ferris Wheel gives you a fantastic view of Santa Monica beach. The day we were there was extremely hot so we had to buy a hat like a lot of others, so the hat people were making a killing that day.

I live in Australia where we are blessed with some pretty amazing beaches but I have to say that I have never seen such an incredible expanse of sand on the beach than that at Santa Monica Bay. The sand is fine white sand and very clean. The beach had a large number of people on it but because the beach and bay covers such a large area, it didn't feel like they were all crammed together.

40,Lightning on the Bay,We had pretty just started our day visit to Sante Monica Pier but were evacuated due to a possibly lightning storm. Good on the authorities for being cautious. We were refunded a fair amount for the tickets we paid and had a great time on the pier otherwise. Had some fun with local bus trips and enjoyed our day in spite of the rain.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jodiep128

40,Nice to walk along the beach,We went on a Thursday so not very busy. $12 to park but I think you pay to park everywhere in LA. Beach was a little dirty with trash. May have not been busy also due to water was under a warning. The shops are pricey since most people there are tourist.

50,"Cool place, a lot of homelessness but the place is sick","Santa Monica is a a cool place with good surfing, body boarding, and a cool pier with bubba gump co. restaurant on it which i recommend.

50,"The pier is fun, beach great and it's a lovely walk to Venice too","Santa Monica is worth a visit for anyone coming to LA. Yes allow 90 minutes to get here from downtown but once here stay for hours. Enjoy the town, the pier, the beach and views then promenade to Venice for the eccentricities. TIP. Take train to Santa Monica and Vermont then bus 704 takes about 80 minutes to the beach. Avoid peak hour though as it will take 2 hours instead.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DiannaC308

Plenty of places to eat, and you get to enjoy street performances by locals. You can do some license-free fishing at the end of the pier. If you decide to use the beach itself, stay on the left side of the pier, closer to Venice beach. The water is way cleaner, and you'll enjoy your experience much more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E150OQgregb
50,Baywatch,Great place with lots to see and do. Miles of sands but you will need puplic transport or a car to go the full length along the coast of Santa Monica. We were short of time so stayed on the S Monica pier but even that took a couple of hours. Well worth it though.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JaneGash

40,Solo Female Traveler,"Parking is $12.00/day if you park in the lot under/near the pier. This is not too bad if you plan to spend the entire day. The beach is very wide making it a decent walk to get to the water. Sunsets from this beach are beautiful and the Pier Park makes it fun as well. Lots to do. You can also pick up the Starline hop on hop off bus at the Santa Monica Pier. You have to walk back up the hill to the street. Be careful, the girls in the Starline establishment will give you wrong information in a heartbeat just to move you on. It is a clean beach and plenty of places to put yourself up for the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GoGurl1
50,Fun in the Sun,When you visit Santa Monica take time to walk along the promenade that offers a great view of the beach and the pier.

The pier is also a fun place to visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Outandabout1208

50,"You Can't Beat Santa Monica Bay, Santa Monica, Ca. Los Angeles County & AFB (SMO)","Well the weather is superb! And it is the most superb weather in all of the world! Although it seems more like one of the ghosttowns in California and other parts of the true west. There is more food and drink and space for one person as if it is a population 1 old historic preservation and conservation site. I especially like this Los Angeles AFB (SMO) location with it's free city wi-fi, street cams, and free computer use at the Santa Monica Main Public Library ($25 if non resident of Santa Monica). Third Street Promenade is the greatest place night or day. And Tongva Park is a sight to see. There are some soloists like GMBR 530 AM/GMBR-TV/GMBR-FM/GMBR Broadcasting Company and GMBR Bush Pilots that is available online in Santa Monica. Hotels and Motels and rentals and sales of homes can be very cheap still. Karen Hall Realty, NAR (Zillow) Santa Monica, Ca. is the best at Air Force Lodging in Santa Monica where the land is best for everything imaginable. http://mdak.on.com/md/558/qusbtlo6ccetc59bz5x4_M.jpg",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karenhD4247VT

There is an aquarium, an amusement center located on the Pier with 13 rides. There are a variety of restaurants and eateries for your dining pleasure and a host of musicians scattered up and down the pier to serenade you as you stroll around. There are wonderful views of the ocean, ships, vistas, surfers and swimmers along with a varied mixture of people from all cultures.Cons: Parking is awkward and convoluted. The Pier is separate from the city of Santa Monica so city sightseeing and buying can be a challenge.All in All, the Pros outweigh the Cons so if you get a chance to visit, by all means, do so!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/858marca

30,Be careful about venturing into the actual water this summer.,"I love the Ocean, but California has been a bit tortured lately. The pier was full of fishermen but I don't think many bothered to read the posted sign warning about high levels of toxicity in the various fish that was posted at the pier. There was black sludge collecting on the shoreline that was keeping back all but a brave few, who likely suffered some kind of consequence later, I'm sure, from going in the water.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JanetMcE

Loved the beach and the healthy lifestyle and the nightlife along 3rd Street Promenade in the evening. Santa Monica had everything to offer for a great start to our holiday - fantastic hotels, beautiful beaches, lots to see and do and great night life. I would definitely recommend for anyone to stay here rather than LA. It is only a short distance away by car and you will have a much more relaxed and enjoyable time staying by the Ocean rather than in the dirty, manic city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/338sharone
50,I live here and even I think it's over priced for Hotels,"I live very near here and I have a bias for the beach area in Santa Monica, Hermosa Beach and Manhattan Beach. My problem with Santa Monica hotels are the prices. I have put family up at Lowes and paid nearly $400 a night. I could put them up at the Portofino in Redondo for much less than half that price. Point is, Santa Monica beach hotels are overpriced for what they offer... If you want a water view. The area itself is a great place to spend a day. WIth the new Gold Line (Light Rail) opening up this year/2016, it will be much easier for people to travel here and see the sites without having to spend a small fortune on a hotel.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F1_Traveler_from_LA

To justify the name Pacific ocean was quite peaceful with friendly waves of reasonable height and less frightening.. A good place for children.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Prabhudoss
20,Nothing special,"Unfortunately, we haven't found anything peculiar about this place. Overcrowded and the ocean is really dirty (I mean seaweed). I tmay be not a problem for someone but I think it unpleasant.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/467ekaterinas
50,Good family Fun,"I wish there was something like this where I lived. My kids talk about this part of the trip the most. The amusement park on the pier is great with great family friendly rides. The staff are good and the rides are clean. They are not like those cheesy local church carnival rides that look like they're about to fall apart.Lots of food and souvenir choices. We ate at The Albright. Line goes fast and lots of places to sit. Food was good too.My only complaint was test the beach in the immediate area of the pier tends to get a little seedy with some homeless and true beach bums. But none the less, still felt totally safe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zacojam
50,Lovely place for an evening walk,"Lovely place to visit, not that much here, small funfair and standard pier attractions and places to eat. At the end of the pier is a nice view of the coast.

50,Oh how I love this place!,"Great place to take the family! The prices are steep at the shops but a little splurging doesn't hurt. Went on a Sunday afternoon/evening and it was still very crowded but not too crowded that you can't enjoy it. The Live bands/acts were great also. The view is gorgeous. The water was nice, sand not so much. I will also note that unlike other beaches I have went to, the Life guards were very alert and attentive, at least the one near us. He didn't just sit in the chair, he walked the beach and kept his eyes on the waters.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KCBrock
40,Fun in the Sun,I love the fact that you can ride your bicycle without people panhandling you the entire ride. You feel so relax by bay with the nice cool breeze. If you are in Los Angeles; go at least once .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melliesue

30,One of the few beaches within the reach in LA,We don't really have much options when it comes to beaches in LA. Santa Monica beach can get crowded. Not much to see. But that's all we have pretty much unfortunately. At least I am happy that the beach is still within the reach. You can do some bicycle riding. There is a bike path that goes down to Venice beach (I believe it goes all the way to Redondo Beach).,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WandererSun
40,A pleasant walk along the beach,"We visited the pier and enjoyed watching the people on the rides and the fishermen (fisherpeople?) trying their luck. Not sure that I would eat anything caught in this location.We strolled south along the beachwalk. There are separate areas for walkers and bikers, rollerbladers, skateboarders so it makes the walk pleasant and much safer. We ended up at the Venice Beach boardwalk which attracts vendors targetting the teen/twenty generation. Fun to watch all the activity.We returned to Santa Monica for dinner as the restaurants in Venice tend to be a bit too trendy for our tastes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Flytdeck

50,Excellent and cool day at the beach,Santa Monica is a great place to chill out at the beach for the day.

50,Beautiful View from Malibu to Palos Verdes,"Santa Monica Bay is my favorite place to spend time in Los Angeles. Whether one is at Malibu, Santa Monica Beach, Venice Beach or the beaches to the south such as Manhattan or Hermosa, the scenery is beautiful. The beaches are clean white sand and there are views of Catalina Island and super tankers going in and out of the Port of Los Angeles. Lots of sailboats can be seen throughout the bay especially on weekends. Santa Monica Pier is a fun place to go along the beach. Great views of the entire bay from the end of the pier and from the top of the Ferris Wheel on the pier. Many times during the year I can see whales and dolphins off shore. Venice Beach is the perfect area for people watching. There are all types of interesting characters at Venice plus lots of entertainment, music, food and an old hippie environment. Malibu at the northern area of the bay is quiet compared to Venice or Santa Monica. Beautiful beaches along the Malibu coastline. Hermosa and Manhattan are more upscale beach areas and quite beautiful. Palos Verdes in the south part of the bay is gorgeous with fantastic views from the cliffs. Throughout the year, many pods of whales pass this location and are easy to see from the cliffside. If you are coming to Los Angeles, be sure to go to some of these beaches for the real California experience !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alanmhersh
20,A disgrace,"Another disappointment as it was so crowded and hard to get about. The beach likewise was crowded and absolutely filthy., including bottles on the beach. A disgrace to LA really.

40,Wide Beach With Lots of Activities,"This beach is very wide and close to the amusements of the pier. You can also walk to some good restaurants and 3rd St Promenade. The water is not the cleanest but is acceptable. Avoid drainage pipes which discharge street and storm water. The ocean by these outlets is not healthy. You'll enjoy clean sand and beautiful views of the bay, Palos Verdes peninsula, the Malibu coastline and Catalina Island on a clear day. A fun day for the kids. If you want strictly ocean activities, I'd head up to Zuma where the water is better, the beach equally huge and lots of families.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hencat
50,Well worth a visit,We visited Santa Monica on an open top bus tour and thoroughly enjoyed it. There was plenty to do on the pier and we walked along the cost line to Venice Beach which was full of character. Glad we did it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janiedmbe

50,Come back time and time again...,"So we've just completed trip number 6 to Santa Monica, this time over July 4th weekend. It's so popular because the beaches, shopping, weather and general relaxed feel of the place is so inviting. It was much busier over Independence day so if you want it a little less busy, avoid that weekend. It never tires and when the sun shines (after that early morning marine layer) it's great for sitting on that beach and soaking up the Californian sunshine. It's safe both day and night..ok seagulls occasionally try to steal your snacks..but hey that's as bad as it gets...the bay is long and wide enough to have your own little area to call your own..we love it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/worldwide002

50,Even better in person!,Santa Monica was truly excellent. Myself and partner drove here from Hollywood and spent the day here and enjoyed it so much. We stayed mainly on the pier and surrounding beach area and the atmosphere is just fantastic. There is lots to do and have to say I enjoyed the Ferris wheel and roller coaster a lot more than I probably should have but when you have a view of a beach this pretty you can't help yourself. Also do yourself a favor and get an ice cream off the pier they are delicious!

We walked to the pier and went straight to the beach and walked towards Venice Beach expecting loads of quirky performers etc but we went during the week so not much going on. The Venice Beach vibe seems to pick up on a weekend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Meeshlee

40,My first thoughts...,"...were that I wished I knew someone with a big yacht that I could be best friends with for an afternoon. There is nothing like sailing around on a big expensive boat that someone else has paid a lot of money for. Can't beat it.Unfortunately, I just got to dream. Oh well...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Elwood_Seattle

40,Beautiful beach but tough parking,"The beach along the Bay is lovely and wide. There are a number of people on surfboards trying to catch the waves. Parking, like most places, can be tough to find. There is valet parking for $7 further along the beach. We did see dolphin from shore.. We headed out of Santa Monica on the PCH, but much of the view of the ocean is blocked for miles by the beach homes.

50,Thanks for the tip Richard Henry Dana,"In Dana's ""Two Years Before the Mast"", from 1840, he carefully lays out so many truisms concerning Santa Monica Bay. One f the things he refers to are the sweet breezes that arise at night. If you are staying at the Casa Del Mar, or any of the nearby beach hotels, be sure to open that window at night and enjoy them for yourself. It is sweet ocean air on a gentle breeze. If you can make a pelagic trip, go for it, you can't go wrong. Depending on the time of your visit, we often of plentiful whale, dolphin and sea lion sightings. Go to the beach, go to the Pier. Breathe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bSirius

We walked miles on the sand and delved into street food. Good parking options available",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/500sudiptab
40,Great Place for a Long Stroll,"After a wonderful breakfast at the Veranda Restaurant (Georgian Hotel), we headed across the street and walked all the way to Venice Beach about 2 miles or so up the road. We took our time both on Ocean Street, which sits above the beach, and also walking the pathway along the beach. We walked into the lobby of the Loews hotel and out onto their balcony/pool area, which is gorgeous. The Venice Beach ""boardwalk"" (a strange name for a pathway that is actually pavement) was exactly what you would expect and for us, not worth the time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Remdawg30

30,Was ok,"walked from Venice Beach to Santa Monica pier. It was a cool, overcast day so no-one on the beach apart from some brave souls near the pier. It was 'interesting' walking along the boardwalk with a mixture of beach ware shops, cafes,etc and some people selling arts and crafts. The pier is old, a couple of rides which would suit young kids, very small. Santa Monica CBD was nice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pommieexpat

50,Wonderful Beach!,I enjoyed my trip to Santa Monica more than anything I did in LA for four days. The beach is like a postcard and very clean. The pier was fun and there was plenty to see and do. I could easily spend 4 days there and just drive into the city if needed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GingerMama2010
40,Quaint,Went here as part of our bus your as they said Venice beach is a bit run down these days. Lovely beach and we walked the pier where there was a fair ground.

Windy day for our visit but so take an extra layer of clothing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tinytrace
40,"Rustic, old school amusement park",It just felt like an old school place. Brings a sense of warmth. Did not take any rides but just took a stroll,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mjl3w
40,On the edge,Great base to visit Los Angeles and other towns and cities nearby. On the edge of so many 'must see' in the area. Santa Monica itself is lovely with lots of shops and restaurants. 20mins from LAX it provides a much quieter alternative to staying in LA without compromising a great time. The hop on hop off stops in Santa Monica and we used it to get in and out of LA. On one side Venice beach on the other a short drive to Malibu. I would happily stay in Santa Monica.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JBM1960
50,Great for people watching,This is a beautiful area. Great sunsets. The beach is very clean and great if you like to exercise. Get there early or take a cab there. Parking seems to be difficult to find.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z5137FAwilliamj

40,Lovely beach,"Huge clean beach. Keep your eyes peeled we saw a sea lion swimming closer to shore than some swimmers ! Plus dolphins within 100metres of the shoreline. Pier is typical but worth a visit for the end of Route 66 signs and funnel cake. Shopping on 3rd Street was good and lots of restaurants.Very large number of homeless people wandering streets, sleeping on beach and grass on cliff tops and scavenging through bins. None bothered us personally but quite shocking to see. Parking is free for first 90 mins in all the car parks we used near 3rd Street and only dollar for each hour after that. Great place to stay away from hustle of Los Angeles",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jillh333
40,Santa Monica Pier!,"We stopped by the pier on a Friday afternoon. There is so much to see and do. Carnival rides and games, a huge Merry-Go-Round. Just an FYI...each ride costs $8.00 per person, so you may want to purchase the all day ride option. Good selection of restaurants, and shops. There is a play area for the kiddos down by the merry go round area. A lot of parking available. Many beautiful photo opportunities!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mamasculley

30,Fun to walk around,We spent a few hours in Santa Monica walking around before heading down to the beach area. We had bags so took of our shoes and went for a walk in the sand. It was nice to breathe some fresh ocean air before walking over to the pier. Our kids went on a few of the rides which they enjoyed. Lots of people on the walkway roaming around and lots of places to get food and snacks. It was a great way to waste a few hours.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JDTravelhome
50,A wonderful place to be in,Everything about the place was nice. Beautiful sea view. Nice breeze. A guy playing soothing songs on the keyboard. Had a great evening.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sanmallya
40,👍🏻,With it's long and wide beaches this place is another great spot among Los Angeles beaches where you can spend a whole day and decide to come back the other. Ones who do not like the quality of food and service are people who have spent too long time on the Mediterranean coasts and expecting the same here. The world is big and there are different spots and cultures all around bros.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Barkan

50,Great experience,"This was the first visit to L.A. for myself and my wife and we stayed in the Beverley Garland Hotel, North Hollywood, which ive got to say is a wonderful hotel with great staff. We wanted to find a place to visit so went to Santa Monica and specifically the pier. To get there we took the hop on hop off bus which gives you commentary all the way there and back which is great if you no very little about L.A. On entering the pier you find yourself at the end of route 66 and a sign depicting this. The pier has many attractions and food outlets. My wife and i enjoy spicy food so we were overjoyed when we found a lovely Mexican restuarant at the end of the pier with great views out to sea. The staff were all dressed in authentic Mexican clothing which added to the experience. So to summarise, Santa Monica is a must for those visiting L.A and the Mexican restaurant served us lovely food with prices very affordable.....If your going to L.A don't miss out on Santa Monica :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Teddyboy63

40,Fantastic and Stunning but too windy today,Pier was great but it was far to windy today and needed to be out of the wind to make it enjoyable. Coming from Australia find it hard to believe that they call it a beach. Wind got so bad found a great bar across the road from the entry to the Pier brilliant for watching the world go by. Del Friscos Grill,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scotg20
50,Amazing beach & views,"Having taken a holiday to Los Angeles I decided to visit Santa Monica, whilst visiting the town I made my way down to the beach and I was taken aback by the beach and its views. I would thoroughly recommend visiting the beach if you are on holiday in Los Angeles or the surrounding area. The view of the pacific is simply breathtaking and the beach itself is equally wonderful. In addition you have the pier which only adds to the splendour of the pacific.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/643ricz

40,A trip to the pier,We went by bus to Santa Monica. A very lively shopping area with heaps of bars & restaurants. Walking over to Santa Monica pier you cross a busy freeway by bridge. The beach is huge & covered in deck chairs. The pier has a Ferris wheel & all the usual side show activities happening with people selling all sorts. Sign saying end of Route 66 seemed to be a popular photo spot.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/396wendyw

40,a large crowded and fun beach with a nice view at sundown,"It is a very long beach with a pier in the middle. It is often crowded and not pretty by itself. But the atmosphere is casual and it is easy to take it easy and walk on the board walk watching,g the crowd and enjoying the sun.It is very difficult to find a parking space outside the public parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sipivu
40,Nice fun easy bike ride at the beach.,"Great place to rent a bike for casual drift along a dedicated path and take in the varied sights. From crazy buffed and showy locals strutting their stuff, the odd swimmer or surfer, beach food, cute Venice canal area, truck-loads of souvenir ships, the huge marina del Rey, interesting design beach houses and wide beach heads all the way down to Redondo. All good fun. Bike rental easy but if you have a specific bike type beyond a well-used American cruiser style you had better book a day or two ahead. Take sun-screen, hat and water with you - you'll be out in it all day for Redondo and back.Don't forget REI for shopping back at Santa Monica after you drop your bike back. n.b. Rentals usually close around 6pm.Buses there and back from the city or Hollywood are about every 30mins and cheap. Allow about 40mins to Santa Monica from Hollywood so can make a full day off it all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KayaknChris

Stalls along the way, mostly touristy stuff (portraits, gimmicks). The beach is large and clean, but it was busy. A great place for people watching as the Californians hang out and practice circus skills and acrobatics on bits of elastic! Also cycle trails along the front.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scotties00

50,Freedom at a glance,"The beach of Santa Monica is one of the places in the US where you can breathe freedom in the air. I was there in the spring, the best moment to go there, according to my opinion. You can witness thousands of people involved in thousands of different activities. Everyone is free to be and do whatever he/she wants without any fear to be judjed or mocked. The beach has facielities for every taste. Whatever your mood is, being there makes you happy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Valex866

It's a shame that the traffic is bad at times but pedestrians well catered for with crossing lights at every junction.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/739PatB
20,"""Home of the homeless""",This was the phrase I heard from a member of staff in a coffee shop just after they ejected a vagrant. Everywhere you go in Venice Beach and Santa Monica there are homeless people camped out and it makes me very nervous when walking about. They approach people and come up to the glass when you are in restaurants. I like the whole LA vibe and the venues we visited were great but the vagrant problem spoils it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kevinr148
50,Tourist,"12 yo had fun on the rides BUT!! The best is the ""BUBBA Gump"" restaurant (From the Forest Gump movie) Food was really great, Service fantastic, would really highly recommend it. Put it on your bucket list!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Revsandblondie
50,Chill out by the beach before that dreaded long flight home.,"If you are filling in time between plane journeys then i would highly recommend this beach.It is not crowded and very very pleasant.LA airport offer a free shuttle bus to the Santa Monica Big Blue Bus No 3.There are printed instructions at the information centre at LAX where we were greeted by a delightful elderly volunteer man who told us ""good choice ladies"". Basically, wait outside under the Blue LAX Shuttle Sign and catch the free shuttle to LAX Parking Lot C shuttle.Exit the bus at the first shuttle stop and walk across the path to the LAX City Bus Transit Center to Bay 12.Take the Santa Monica Big Blue Bus #3.It costs US$1.00 one way(how cheap is that for a half hour ride.)Exit bus at 4th Street & Broadway Ave.Walk west on Broadway Ave for one block to the 3rd Street Promenade and the Santa Monica Place shopping mall.Warning allow 1 hr to return back to airport if it is after 4.00pm because of peak hour traffic.Plenty of cafes and restaurants for all taste buds.What i personally loved about this beach is that there are tourist security guards who give you a business card and you can text 310-499-2928 for parking assistance,events,directions and feedback.So as a tourist you are perfectly safe.We saw a seal close to shore and it was just nice to sit and take in the lovely seabreeze before our flight home.There were buskers and a lady with a parrot and a man with a snake if you want a photo with them(of course for a small fee).One guy was funny about 30 yrs old had a cardboard sign which read 'Small change please"".Two blonde pretty German tourists were behind us and he turned his sign over and it read ""Your hot! and he called out to the girls ""I''ll take phone numbers"".so i laughed and said "" girls, you would of made his day if you gave him a phone number and they said,"" We should of given him a fake one"".It is all good and a bit of fun when you are on holidays.It certainly makes the atmosphere of Santa Monica.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lorainev861

50,Well worth a visit,There was a heatwave when we went so very busy. We are glad we went there as a really nice place to visit,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/119melb
40,A must visit,"What's not to love? Stretches of sandy white beaches and surf. This is California at its best. Take a walk from Santa Monica pier up to Venice beach or ride a bicycle or rollerblade/rollerskate (they are all on hire). My friend and I walked all the way up and then got tired and so hired segways. A segwa is that funny looking two-wheel device that you see in movies. I have always wanted to try one. As nerdy as one looks riding a segway with a helmet on, it was such great fun and it saved my feet. We got back in record time and the guy we hired them from was waiting to take them off our hands (that was great service). Loved this time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chantin2015

30,Free but just okay,"Now I like the beach. I like tourism too. But the pier was a little too manufactured and your food options are places like Bubba Gump Shrimp. If you are looking for less chain style places, this isn't where you want to go. There is a small amusement park area but we didn't go experience any of the rides. If you like Dave and Busters you will like this place. Don't plan your whole trip around it, but it also isn't the worst place ever. Maybe plan for one afternoon or evening of rides and silliness.There is pay parking that was about 2 bucks and hour i think.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ikirol

50,The Boardwalk/Pier is Awesome.,"When we lived in California, we never went to the pier, and so now, leaving the cold and snow of the east, we decided that this was a must see and do. Santa Monica is beautiful and the pier is a blast. The only thing was there was a cold fog the rolled in while we were on the ferris wheel which really made us cold. But we can imagine on a beautiful clear day that it would be heaven riding up there with the vista's all around. There was a great street magician there, an older guy who was the best we've every seen. And the things to see and buy and try were just fabulous. Don't miss out on a piece of California history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Themysticman

50,Fun,"We went to Santa Monica bay and pier today, it was extremely busy which we expected on Good Friday Easter. The beach is beautiful, the pier is heaps of fun with buskers, little shops etc. You can hire push bikes to ride on the safe bike track along the beach. We had mega fun. We were visiting from Australia.Definitely worth a visit. You can catch the Big Blue public bus there from the LAX airport area for $1 a trip. Bus is air conditioned and you do not need to stress over LA traffic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wendy22102

40,Bay & Pier,I think I am more writing for the Pier... Its more of a touristic fun with some shops and limited eateries. The view from the pier although is great. More famous due to the Baywatch thing.... It was too cold to get a taste of the beach but the area around is beautiful and worthy of visiting once. Still would ask people to save time here and head for Venice beach.. its double the fun for sure.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ranupams
50,Quintessential CA,"My nineteen year old son and I recently took a spur-of-the-moment trip to Los Angeles, and decided to stay in Santa Monica for three of the nights we were there. What a good decision that was! The beach is lovely, and there are many shops and restaurants in which to spend your time. The area is equally fun to see at night as it is during the day. We are very happy that we decided to spend a few days in this area. It seemed to be a good location from which to venture into other areas of LA as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Geneva_IllinoisJanet

The pier is great, with little shops, great restaurants, and a little theme park. It was very busy but that didn't take away from all the things you can enjoy there. Parking can get a little hectic but they have plenty of ""garage"" parking for a low fee. Great neighborhood. We will be visiting soon!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ileanab873

30,Nice Sunset,We visited Santa Monica Pier after touring LA all day. It was crowded and people watching was interesting. We enjoyed a stroll on the boardwalk and a nice meal. While dining we were treated to a beautiful sunset. This is a nice place to visit for the history and because you have probably heard of Santa Monica Pier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RDW858

50,Beachside Heaven,"Fantastic place to take a walk along the beach, relax and unwind. The Pier is of course the diamond in the crown for fun activities, great places to grab a bite to eat, the amusement park at the end and of course people watching. Try a funnel cake if you get time or have a meal at Bubba Gumps",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravellingTarns
50,make sure you add this to your sightseeing tour,Our disappointment was we ran our of time to see all we wanted to see ....... so give yourself plenty of time to do the pier and Venice Beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/898nikkib
50,Oh how i miss Santa Monica,"We were holidaying from Australia and Santa Monica was our first ""beach"" stop on our day out in a hire car. Wow. What an impression this has made on us. The pier with the rides is dated, but we had so much fun. We sat and watched people riding and rollerblading and working out. It was so different!Definitely recommend visiting here!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VeeDee1982
40,As it should be,"Santa Monica is as you expect, glam and expensive for the most part, but with real people carved into the LA lifestyle.

40,Beautiful views and nice beach,"We went to the Bay for a quick visit and lunch. The views were great and the beach looked beautiful. We were there in March and the pier had plenty of people. Based on this, we might guess it is very crowded during the summer months. The shops on the pier sold mostly junky souvenirs, but the ice cream at the Soda Jerks shop by the carousel was great.Parking was only $1 per hour near the base of the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/newengland50

50,Riding Bikes along the beach,We rented bikes in Santa Monica and rode along the bike path to Venice beach and back. It was great fun to people watch and also see all the vendors along the way.

40,Nice Day Trip,"We ended our California vacation by spending the day on the pier, I will say I think it would be much prettier at night when it's all lit up. We had a lovely stroll along the pier and enjoyed looking out at the water and watching the men fish.We were lucky enough to be able to see some wildlife, we had a seal swim up looking for food and there was a boat full of seals sunbathing.I look forward to coming back in warmer weather maybe for a swim!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dodobir
50,Always a great place to visit and walk around.,"I still do not get why it is so popular, its smelly, the beach is dirty, the pier is packed, the beach is packed, the water is dirty, but yet, here we are, always a stop when we go down there. love the peopel watching, the tourists are fun to watch. The private reptile and bird zoo is crazy, i say it is animal abuse. I guess might as well make money of your pets. n8oD",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JJBrownBrown
50,The Best of LA county!,"They have the best pier in the state of California, food galore, amazing beaches, bike path for miles, and the best shopping that Los Angeles County has to offer. And the cherry on the top is the new subway station being built next to the pier and 3rd street promenade. 3rd street has the best people watching outside on San Fran. And it's very deverse with a little bit for everyone. Our favorite part are the street performers, that make the whole day worth while ;-)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/737travish

50,My Home Beach,"If I had ten thousand words to describe my home beach I would fill volumes in the libraries of the world. The Santa Monica Pier is my favorite place, and as I look out over the ocean at sunset the whole of the ocean surface appears to be on fire. It is where I go for healing, peace, and serenity. As I walk down the steps next to Bubba Gumps and on to the North Sands of the beach all the toxins are flushed away. I had some swelling in my right foot and thirty minutes later it had vanished.What can I say but Santa Monica Pier and Beach is my true love. You can give me all the beautiful places in the world but as for me I would give it all up just to be on my home beach. Like southern California it is the same for the pier and beach, it is my most beautiful love, and my place to commune with my Hannah. I love her so, she is my passion, my heart, my spirit, and my soul. May it never leave this earth. Santa Monica Pier and Beach, I truly love and adore you. Kiss.You will pay a fee for parking, I think it is still $6.00.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ericab838
50,Escape and Enjoy Santa Monica Bay,"Santa Monica Bay is so much more than just a bay. Sunsets are beautiful with or without the Santa Monica Pier and Ferris wheel in your photos. Photo ops are so numerous, you have many options. Nearby Oceanfront Avenue parallels the beach, and you can walk from one restaurant to the next, read the menus posted outside and choose where you want to dine. In most restaurants, you can walk in and find a table just before or after peak times of the day. Definitely check TripAdvisor for restaurant reviews. We like to try different restaurants on Oceanfront before or after photos of the sunset. Definitely a destination to get away from the frenzy of in other LA areas.Santa Monica Bay is at the end of the now Historic Route 66, the famous historic highway from Chicago to Santa Monica. (Officially decommissioned as a U.S. Highway in 1985.) Will Rogers Park is located between Oceanfront Avenue and the bay. Also, Santa Monica Place and Third Street Promenade for shopping are located just two blocks from the bay. With history, shopping, restaurants, and fun, Santa Monica Bay is gorgeous and offers so much it's hard to know where to begin your visit. We start by parking at the at the parking garage on Third Street and plan our visit so we are at Santa Monica Bay at sunset! It's a beautiful getaway!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RikiUSA

50,Great place to see.,"This is a great place to visit for just a short time or to spend all day. It's a little more classy than Venice Beach but not really better. Just different and more touristy.

30,Santa Monica Bay (Muscle Beach),"Not so amazing as shown in films which dwells on the best parts. We spent three weeks here as participants in the Malibu International Film Festival (Special Jury Award) and as a consequence saw much of Santa Monica, and Los Angeles in general. This was the only place you could thankfully walk all the way to Venice Beach and beyond. The rest of LA was car infested all the way to Hollywood, which was a hateful place. Only the Hispanic workers travel by the meagre public transport available. Cinema dominates over all, even the waiters and waitresses in restaurants we went to were 'resting' actors and desperate for recognition. ""Hey, can I give you my card? You don't know who you'll meet. You could help me!"" Ugh! The 'desperation' in LA pervades everything, and it is refreshing to return back to the sanity of walk-free Santa Monica. But as already intimated, the beach which extends to Venice, is not special. And Venice until very recently was a place where the delinquents and homeless ended up. In all, a depressing location.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/georget703

40,Urban beach and boardwalk,Fun beach with music on the peer. Clean sandy beach that was a fun walk. We parked down from the boardwalk and walked in. Parking meters stated our parking was valid till 5 and we could not get it to register a parking for later so we ended up watching the sunset from the beach nearby and sort of looked over our shoulder to make sure we were not being ticketed. Parking lto was open till sunset but for some reason the meters did not have time available till sunset which was about 7:00 that night.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/miken655

50,Wear comfortable shoes and start here,"My daughter, who lives in LA, brought me by car to the Santa Monica Pier. Parking was reasonable, perhaps because it was evening, and it wasn't a bad walk from the lot to the pier. On the pier there are public restrooms, restaurants, shops, especially souvenir shops, some rides, most notably a Ferris wheel with a great light display, plenty of places to sit and look at the water, and some musicians and other entertainers trying to earn a living. If you are wise enough to wear comfortable shoes or sneakers, you can walk from the pier, on an overpass spanning the street, and find your way to the Third Street Promenade, and lots more restaurants.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CDwheels

50,A beautiful beach experience.,"Fantastic beach. Use Santa Monica Blvd and avoid the freeways. Excellent restaurants and shopping. Use public parking ramp, it's free for first hour and a half, and then quite reasonable. Parked entire day for $11.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kenc901
40,Beautiful place,This place is beautiful and the people are so friendly and welcoming. We didn't get to go into the waters because it was such a short trip with so much to see and do already but we will be visiting again soon. There were lots of people on the beach so I'm sure others had a great time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/natlove007
50,Sunsets,We headed to Santa Monica one afternoon and watched the sun go down. I honestly don't think you've ever really seen a sunset until you see a Pacific sunset. I almost turned into the double rainbow guy from YouTube!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnAElliott
50,Loved Santa Monica,We will definitely stay at Santa Monica longer on our next holiday. Loved the area and wondering around the beach area. Great beach - beautiful clear water be it a little cool. Make sure you spend some time walking on the pier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Trish4040

40,Great beach for viewing not swimming.,"As a local I can tell you that Santa Monica has pretty dirty waters. I would not recommend swimming in the waters ever.The pier is just great, they have a Ferris wheel and other rides.There is a great arcade with multiple types of games.Snacks, GREAT restaurants, and if you go on a weekend many side attractions as well.I would recommend to come here and tan on the sand, enjoy the views, shop, eat, and take lots of pictures.If you are looking for cleaner waters I would go further up north.A little bit further down is Malibu, which has better views and a much cleaner feel but does not have a pier and arcade.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/562margaritas
40,On the Pacific,"Santa Monica was going to be the start of our road trip along the PCH to San Francisco. First we needed to find a parking spot se we can walk along the bay and then hit the pier.Santa Monica is funky and busy, the beach had kids running around, the pier was heaving and our kids wanted to go on the rides. We wanted to spend more time in Santa Monica but we needed to hit the road so we could not spend as much time as we liked.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PrestonGuild
50,Awesome day trip,"The bay/pier has a whole day's worth of activities. Aside from walking along the pier, there is the arcade and restaurants to visit. Below the pier is a great playground with lots to see and do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EliE706
50,Santa Monica Pier is a great way to spend an afternoon,We had a wonderful time at the Santa Monica Pier. We sat at the Pier & people watched for a while. We ate lunch & enjoyed the amusement park.

40,everything you see in the movies,"It was an awesome stunning experience, there were a lot of beggars and they were not afraid to ask for even a penny. Clean area though. loved the walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/274olivial
20,Could have skipped it.,"Not much in the way of shopping, I don't swim at beaches, and there's only so much time you can spend contemplating the ocean as an alternate activity, so that made the trip somewhat of a bust.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Anyaria
40,An icon place,"lovely place, chilled and relaxed feel. Great ice creams somewhere everyone should visit. Easy to park, lots of things going on, we all loved it",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chattogill
50,Must visit,"Santa Monica is a must visit when in LA. whether in the morning or at night this place is just so amazing. Walk on the beach or just sit & admire the sea.

50,Go for a stroll,Great place to visit and experience some of LA' colourful personalities. Always something new to see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rivi64
50,Beautiful Sunsets!,"I live close by so I frequent this place. The crowd can sometimes be overwhelming, especially during the summer. I bike nearby, hike and yes...swim too. Great selection of restaurants/bars and so great for people watching. Delightful!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aprilg463
50,California Dreaming,"Nice shops near the beach, the pier didn't have too much going on when we were there, but there was a muscle car show - saw a lot of cars.It was nice to sit on the beach and watch a surfer, who we were willing to do what he does well and he did.We took the bus from west Hollywood and it was around a 45min/1hr journey but with a little preaching on the bus - not from me, the journey was interesting and memorable. A great day out!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OrangeLions
40,Very trendy spot to spend some time.,"3rd avenue promenade is nice, safe and clean. Bars and restaurants all very stylish. Walk into the shopping centre at the end of 3rd avenue and do a bit of shopping.Some quality bars and restaurants on top level.Walk to the pier for a bit of fun and nostalgia.Worth a day to visit and a lot better than many areas of LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robf112
50,"Santa Monica, the end or the beginning of Route 66.","The pier is just something you need to experience if you visit LA, the trip down to the pier is well worth it. The entertainers are everywhere and there is a bunch of food choices. When you have finished visiting the pier take a stroll downtown and just soak up the atmosphere. This is where the rich and famous take their summer holidays!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stephencball
40,Great beach !!,Awesome beach...it was clean...we got ourselves wet here in water...then you have a place specially to watch the sunset...ample places for parking...lovely scenery...we spent the whole evening sitting and watching sun setting..it was beautiful ...good crowd on pier....place to take some real good pictures.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anuag
40,Nice but crowded,"easy to get to from Hollywood, we took the hop on hop off bus tour. Really enjoyed the views and atmosphere, also the area was kept quite clean too. The only thing I didn't like was how crowded the pier was. We went around lunch time though so maybe if we went first thing in the morning it may be less crowded.definitely recommend trying the icecream at the little old school style carousel at the bottom of the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/933dane
40,Beautiful weather,"Tried to visit the Observatory but couldn't park. It was our day of departure, weather had finally warmed up so we went to the beach. Wanted to go somewhere else as had been to Santa Monica Pier in 2003 but not too far from airport. Had lunch at Perrys which was OK but nothing special. Toilets on beach nowhere to wash hands & a load of tramps hanging about. Huge expanse of sandy beach but clearly very wealthy & very poor people in the vicinity.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kez64
50,Wonderful beach and pier activities,"A great beach where you can frequently see seals, pelicans and sometimes dolphins. Lots of activities including the Venice board walk, the Santa Monica Pier and the new Muscle Beach. Lots of great places to eat -- from casual to mighty fine. Mighty fine often requires a reservation. Also, there are some splendid hotels along the beach. You will pay for the splendor!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ellen0417
30,Crowded & nothing much to write about,The place is very crowded and can be found dirty at some places. There are lots of eateries to choose from but nothing special is on offer. It is a decent place to visit during the evening hours to soak in the bay experience but not high on recommendation.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gautam_Great
30,"Beautiful beach, lots of homeless","It breaks my heart to see people rummaging through the bins searching for food. They don't even beg, because they care so assured of rejection. This was more so evident at Santa Monica Pier, and the poverty of the homeless is juxtaposed by the excesses of the tourist. The bag is pretty at night, the Pier lights up with neon lights. Not much to do though, although there are some excellent restaurants in the vicinity.Visited in August 2013",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sonsonator
40,"Lovely, but crowded","The view from the beach and pier is gorgeous. But it's crowded. Definitely not something I'd want to plan a day around, because I didn't find it fun to be around that many people. But still, watching the sunset was amazing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D1H4
40,Waterfront scenic view,Lots of rides and amusement place for the kids and not so young kids. Just like a mini carnival with games and such. Can watch the water nearby along the shore. Snacks and drinks for everyone.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/precie2015
50,Beautiful place to visit,the whole Santa Monica area is well worth the trip. We went there and had a look at the whole area down to Venice. It is a very pretty area and the people are pretty eye opening. The rides at the pier are good value and our kids really enjoyed them.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Macfamily2103
50,Beautiful even in the rain,Loved the beach at Santa Monica but certainly didn't see it at its' best as it rained continuously. Went to Chez Jays bar which was atmospheric and friendly and welcome shelter!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ladymancunian
40,Nice Californian beach,"Nice beach!! Coming from Australia I didn't expect a lot but I was pleasantly surprised. Unfortunately the day I was there is was one of those rare rainy days in LA so I didn't get to enjoy it in the sunshine, but it would have been a really nice to hire a bike and ride the track down to Venice beach. I think Californian coastline is spectacular. The hotels and eateries along the main drag have a really nice view Santa Monica Bay.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KristyPan
50,Whale and sea mammal watching,"We took a whale viewing and sea mammal watching tour from the marina. It was approx. a 3 hr trip. We were taken to areas visited by seals and sea lions, we experienced the playful antics of dolphins first hand in nature where they belong as they swam alongside or led our boat disappearing in a moment when the motor was turned off. We had the opportunity to spot one grey whale migrating down to warmer Mexican waters to give birth to her baby. It was an experience of a lifetime, nature at her best. Pelicans and other sea birds also added to the whole experience. The boat crew was efficient and polite. Tickets should be bought on groupon with a generous discount. I highly recommend for nature and sea lovers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DavidaV_13

50,Get your kicks!,"We visited Santa Monica as part of a day tour of LA.We were surprised to find out that the end of Route 66 is on the pier; albeit the unofficial one (in our opinion - the original plaque is a couple of blocks away on the main road).This added something a little special to our trip as we are both Route 66 fans and never expected to see this (or the original, which was worth the walk to find).The pier itself isn't huge, but has plenty to see. It wasn't too crowded when we visited which was nice.It was a nice place for a walk and well worth a visit.(If you're looking for a quieter pier/beach, try Manhattan Beach instead)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MissHolders
40,"One the best to enjoy the seaside, sunset, and people of all colors!","It is a great place surrounded by many choices for your liking....from large crowds at he Pier with rides..many restaurants along Ocean Ave....3rd Street Promanade ....yes, people of all colors...and range, not only skin, clothing and faces... from ""California girls"" in bikinis to the homeless in blankets!

Lot's of people quite crowdy.Good for a walk, beautiful beach and nice pier.I didnt know that it's the place where the historic route 66 has one of its ends.What surprised me was the fact that there is a lot of homeless ""looking"" people it made me feel unsafe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/krakowiak81
50,Best place to surf and to have fun! :),Do you like to surf? Do you like rides? If you like does things this is the place for you. In the morning the Ferris wheel at the pier lights up and is beautiful. On Saturday and Sunday is crowded but it's worth it. I love to surf and it's usually a good place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Palomared
50,Nice evening,Try the rides! They are cheap and fun. No need to queue for a long time at all. Watch the sunset! Have some nice food! What a great evening.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/xuefeix
40,Great light show at night,I had a chance to visit the pier with family it was fun.. Lots to see beautiful at night the ferris wheel gives a great overview at night.

40,Beautiful pier with lots to see,The Santa Monica Pier is a very high energy place with lots of street performances. It overlooks the ocean and there are lots of treats and food to eat. It's very interesting and I could spend a whole day there. Would revisit if I had the chance.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/165caramel1
50,Beautiful,"Santa monica is so beautiful with a great view over the ocean. Check out ""end of the trail"" for route 66 on the pier. Can be a bit hard to find a parkingplace for the car on a busy day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanielKif

40,Lovely place,Beautiful long beach and pier. Hire a bike from one of many places and cycle the bike path to Venice and beyond or towards Malibu. I found everyone here very friendly. Lots of interesting and quirky folk here. There are a lot of homeless people in the area but they were just going about their business. Plenty of shops and places to eat out too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Blahdeblah
40,A Nice Beach with Good Shopping Nearby,"The beach is nice and it's especially great if you ride your bike along the bike path. It'll take you all the way to Venice Beach. You can also make a quick stop on the Santa Monica Pier and either get on a ferris wheel, go to the end of the pier and see people fishing, or just enjoy the view of the ocean and coastline from both sides. Once you're done there, you can walk a few blocks and head to 3rd Street Promenade which has a variety of clothing stores, a movie theater, a book store, some restaurants, and a nice outdoor mall at the end of it. You can also drive north to Malibu and beyond on Pacific Coast Highway and enjoy the beautiful Southern California coastline.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LASeoulGuy
50,Nice place,"Very nice place, the beach, the streets, the bar. Everything is good in this place.Certainly I could to live there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aldo_Yamaguchi
40,Quick visit,"It's a beach..If you're a tourist I suggest you to do a small stop simply to get the vibe of Santa Monica Pier and to walk on the beach. Although It is very nice, there's not much to see. I mean the views of the mountains and the ocean are beautiful but you can see that from any other place. So we decided to rent bikes to enjoy the view toward Venice Beach. (8$/hour but we had the GoCard --> check it out!)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I1824AHmariab
50,Beautiful urban beach,Classic southern CA beach. Fun. Must see when visiting west Los Angeles. Drive north to Malibu and Oxnard for more rural beauty.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrsL455
40,Worth the visit,"Pretty hard to go to LA and not end up here. I liked the acro yoga on the beach Sunday arvo. The pier is so touristy, wouldn't recommend, just walk/cycle around the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jonosaurus
40,Santa Monica- lovely beach and pier,"Made my way to Santa Monica on the Starline hop on off bus. I always wanted to dip my toe in the Pacific Ocean and I achieved it on Santa Monica's large beach, Took a stroll along the pier and the view around the bay from the pier was wonderful. In all my visits around Santa Monica and other parts of Hollywood, Brentwood, Beverly Hills, Rodeo Drive, not a 'celebrity' to be seen. They must have known I was coming !!!!!!!!!!!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Duggie65
30,Arrive early,"Technically speaking, the Santa Monica Bay is not in Los Angeles. It can also get very crowded on Summer weekends, so get there early.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarmichaelVentura
50,Just a Fun place to visit,"It's part of history and fun to be able to say you've been there. The bay and beaches either side are full of characters, signs and odd balls and is a must together with a visit down the road (actually a short bike ride along the promenade) to Venice beach",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Glemonsec
50,Beautiful,A very beautiful and peaceful beach located within 30mins from the LA international airport. Many people riding bicycle or jogging on the path along the beach. I spent 3 hours here before heading to the airport and felt relaxing. Will definitely come back if I am at LA again next time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SunnyS998
40,A must visit,You're more likely to see a celebrity here than you are in Hollywood. This is a hotspot for the rich and famous. Make sure you walk down the pier and enjoy the surroundings. There is always something happening. It's a beautiful beach and you can spend a good couple of hours wandering around. If you're up for a walk you can walk down to Venice beach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ero40
50,Wonderful American boardwalk vibe,"Walked to santa monica pier from venice beach,lovely 40 minute walk,you can feel the different vibe as you leave venice behind and approach the more upmarket santa monica,the homeless bodies seem to disappear as you walk.the pier was lovely with breath taking views,we ate at buba gumps on the pier and can highly recommend,lovely vibe,a must do,the little town itself was very nice although it was sunday and we only passed through,i did however get the opportunity to hols a snake for $5, good experience and not anything id usually do,mustve been the santa monica vibe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LisaO605

Then we walked along the beach! The water was ice cold but we just had to put our feet in! It was a very special day!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melodiepenrod
50,Nice place to relax,This place is great to unwind alone or with the rest of the family. You can either just seat and watch the little waves clash through the sands or jog around the path. Parking is difficult on busy weekends though but it's worth the wait.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MsMay822
40,Worth a Visit,"Lovely beach, great pier and felt cleaner and safer than Venice Beach. Although the walk between them is worth doing. Definitely worth a wander round the shops too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TLW_1

40,Lovely beach,We must have been lucky when we chose to visit here as it was a beautiful day but hardly any people.

50,:D,"Loved it. The views from this beach are incredible, I went a few times and we often saw dolphins jumping in and out of the sea earlier in the mornings. We were able to get free wifi whilst on the beach which really came in handy. Its very relaxing and theres lots to do including renting a bike, beach games, surfing and visiting the pier which is a must. Lovely restaurants and good fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RKB0022

50,Beautiful,"Nice beach, decent calm environment. Rented a bike and rode along the track for most of the morning. Then checked out the little amusement park, and went for red lobster right next to it. The Pier is just a walk away from the promenade. You can spend an entire day just chilling in this area..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/13alecs
50,Ocean wonderful breeze,"if you like traveling around the beach area, you must visit Santa Monica Pier and the beach it's completely like a different world all together the atmosphere, the krazy-looking carnival type rides, and extoic foods and drinks, if doing a night visit bring a sweater or a hoodie.Overall the site seeing is great to see!!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Forture-950
40,Great day beach and shops,We enjoyed a lovely day in Santa Monica walked out on to the Pier enjoyed the sun and sights then walked over to the promenade and had a few hours shopping and a great lunch on the roof top of the mall. We were staying by LAX and the return taxi was about $90,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/susang842
40,Nice!!,I enjoyed Santa Monica Pier and the beach. It was much better and cleaner than Venice. I recommend this beach and the shopping area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mschiffon
40,A scenic beauty....,Santa Monica Bay covers a huge area from the Palisades up to Point Dume. Worth taking a sea cruise to see the magnificence from the ocean perspective.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thomassG3669AB
40,"Beautiful beach, crazy parking","The beach was incredibly clean, organized and safe. The beach had life guards positioned across the beach. Awesome views over the coast. However unless you want to spend the day at the beach ($15 is pretty standard for LA) go further down and park on the street and pay at the metre for a far more reasonable rate.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Louise1706
40,Great shopping experience!,We didn't go to Santa Monica for the beach - we took a walk down there and the beach is nice and wide - we didn't go in the water. The pier is a little tacky for our taste - the usual Bubba Shrimp and funnel cakes and rides that you can see anywhere at these types of locations.We really enjoyed the shops on 3rd street - the street is a pleasant area to spend a morning or afternoon with plenty of restaurants etc. Santa Monica is an upscale beach town and a welcome break from the traffic in LA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IGDM
40,This is a great beach,This is such a wonderful beach and it is enhanced by the strand which is a street wide sidewalk and all of the things going on along the beach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ET-retired
50,Great Beach For Families,"My family visited the beach after walking along the Santa Monica Pier. This is a very clean, family oriented beach with lots of kids frolicking in the water with boogie boards. Lots of life guards around on duty too. They have an outdoor shower pole for rinsing off your legs and feet, and lots of public bathroom stalls for changing clothes.I'd say this is one of the nicest beaches in the LA area. There's parking right next to the beach for $15/day, and you can probably find cheaper parking a little inland from the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cohoman
40,Very nice coast but busy,"It is very nice and long stretch of beautiful and relaxing coast with all the facilities in near reach. I has a nice pedestrian and cycle lanes which completes the fun: beach, walking, cycling, peer, and restaurants.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/osamayoussef
50,Gorgeous beach,"I'm not normally a ""sit at the beach and relax all day"" kind of person, so I never expected to fall so head over heels in love with Santa Monica. If I could have, I would have rescheduled my flight just to spend more time here. I haven't felt so relaxed in a long time. You could easily spend a few days here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rebeccabredin
50,Beautiful coast of Santa Monica;),"Coast of Santa Monica loved. Very broad coastline, pretty beach with special places for recreation and sports, spacious bike lanes through the entire length of the beach, entertainment center right on the dock of the bay, and much more that makes a stay at the beach in Santa Monica great =)The only thing that really surprised is the fact that we were in Santa Monica in March and on the street was 30 degree heat, and the water in the ocean at this point was just ice !!!It was nice to be on the coast of Santa Monica and live to experience the atmosphere, which is trying to convey to us in many Hollywood films and television series, especially cool to see live was the atmosphere in the square near the beach in Santa Monica, where people do all sorts of things, sell their painted paintings, glasses, clothes or make reading poems or performing his own music, and it was all as colorful as it was shown in my favorite TV series Californication;)))I advise you to be sure to wait for the sunset on the beach in Santa Monica and distancing from the amusement park, to be photographed against the backdrop of the ferris wheel and the beautiful California sunset))) Photos will be great;)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alex_TI84
50,must do day trip,easy to get to. Catch a hop on hop off bus which run frequently. Also travel down to Venice beach and Marina Del Ray. Well worth the time,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leanne776
40,Huge,"I couldn't get over how wide the beach was, from the sea to the sidewalk. The sand is sheer, fine and golden, like caster sugar. I was surprised how few people were there to sunbathe; instead they were cycyling past, rollerblading, segwaying, playing volleyball or jumping on the hoops. Plenty of restrooms dotted from one end of Santa Monica Bay to the other. A great place to people watch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NinjaS84

20,Very Crowded,If you want to swarm to a beach with 5 million other people this is the place for you. Beach was dirty and the water didn't look too good either. Won't be going back....,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/captains2014
50,Very nice public beach,"I had never visited Santa Monica Beach before. I've always been fascinated with the entertainment on Venice Beach. Santa Monica has so much more - pier, playground, quite beach, carnival rides and games, street entertainers, bike paths, restaurants, and shops. We loved the Farris Wheel, ate funnel cake, played in the ocean, and swung on the swings. Saturday was our last full day in LA and we enjoyed spending the day at the beach.Tip - we parked in the parking deck behind City Hall for $3.50 which cost less than parking at the meter. A little walk but economical.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WGwiz
30,Ehh,"Santa Monica, while offering great scenery and an awesome beach isn't really anything special. If you enjoy swimming and don't mind crowds, or enjoy touristy shops then this may be for you. However, don't base a trip on going to Santa Monica as there are plenty of other great places to visit in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/QuixotixAU

40,Beautiful place,"I drove down from Beverly Hills for the day - first going to Malibu Beach which was stunning and some beautiful houses right on the water! Santa Monica Beach was stunning. The weather was gorgeous, lots of people around and a great place to do a spot of people watching and enjoy the atmosphere. Definitely take a stroll along the Pier and if you have time to go on the Ferris Wheel its worth the view. A great day trip to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ukmorrows
50,This is the life!,Do not miss out on visiting this beach.What a great place to see the real people of los angeles.It is great to come down and get some fresh air.

One of my favorite places in LA by far.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dublingirl18

40,Good way to fill in a couple of hours,"Caught the '#3 Blue Bus"" at $1 each way per person from LAX to Santa Monica and walked out to the pier.

50,I personally love it.,"I have to give it five stars because it's just a favorite experience of our visit to LA. I could give four stars because of minor complaints like it being crowded and such, but come on, that is part of the experience. Great beach, great hotels, dining and shopping close by, and an amusement park on the pier! What's not to love?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rhunt9
40,Great place to stroll and relax,"If you're visiting LA and check out Santa Monica, kick back at the pier and beach if you have time. Although busy and often crowded during the summer, your trip to Santa Monica is not complete without some shots of yourself at the pier and beach. Palisades park on the bluffs above is also a nice place to stroll.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JJCrawford
50,Beautiful all over!,"Was killing some time running around LA and it came to me that I never been to Santa Monica Beach. Shame on me right? So I took the 10-15min drive(30min with traffic) and I was not disappointed. Nice scenery, clean beach. Lifeguards mile apart from each other. And not to mention all the beautiful people your surrounded by. Great place for a jog. Places like this make you feel proud to be a Californian.

30,Not so clean,On my visit to LA from CT this was on my top list. I was quiet disappointed as this place was smelly overcrowded and not so clean..,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/akankshay
30,Just a Beach,"Nice for walking, jogging, biking, sunbathing, roller skating, people working outits expensive…parking, eating, the shop are little huts, not sure why all the fuss … the beach is average.restaurants not worth the prices they charge.But I guess it because its Santa Monica and people with money who will pay ridiculous price for homes there make it popular.There is nothing special about it…Hippy style beach…...not that that’s a bad thing… looks run down, loads of homeless people, some characters, but they seem harmless. Not sure I would venture out at night thou.Arnold Schwarzenegger, was suppose to of been homeless so that’s why these homeless pole do not get moved on as Anni has influence.Tip: Better off going down to Venice beach and staying around the pier, a bit cleaner.I think there is where most people who gave 4-5 stars where, do not forgot the beach is long an depending which end you are at will depend if you like it.Go see it, just to say you been there.Good to spend a day, chilling, grabbing some beach food.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/341ava

Lots to see and do and plenty of great restaurants and cafés.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ParqueTropical
50,Best in LA,"I think Santa Monica Bay is the best seaside visit in LA! The beach is perfect, a Santa Monica has a huge variety of cafés and restaurants, parking is reasonable, and the pier is great fun. If you have only time to visit one beach in LA make it this one.

50,Love It the End of Route 66,"Every time we visit Los Angles we always stop off at the Pier to enjoy the day at the beach. We always find something exciting to get into at the pier. It should be noted that we visited the pier on Christmas Eve... and while the rest of the country was under winter freeze and snow advisory, we as a family was relaxing on the beach...""What A Life"". In short, if possible please try to catch the sunset at the pier, simply beautiful!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Minrcm
30,Beautiful beach but so many people,This beach is beautiful. The pier has great views. I loved riding the Ferris wheel on the pier. The traffic to get there was insane and the number of people made it a little unbearable. We went on a Saturday so I would recommend a weekday.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JChinto

50,Very nice,"Our visit to Los Angeles would have been absolutely incomplete had we not visited Santa Monica Bay and PierIt was late afternoon when we reached and the sea breeze was strong enough to almost make us feel that it could blow us awayThe bay was great .. The Pacific was not too ruffled that day and the waves were gentle,the sand was soft and we enjoyed ourselvesThe wash facility at the corner of the stairs beside Bubba Shrimp was very convenientThe Pier was magnificent ... It was festive without needing to be overly so and it was an instant mood lifter just to be thereOne envied the people who were casting their fishing rods and spending a lazy afternoon thereOne word of caution though .. The boulevard fringe draws attention of the homeless as evening comes, and while they absolutely keep to themselves, it would be prudent to avoid interfering with them as they settle into their personal spaces",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A202
40,Pretty resort,"Spent a very pleasant afternoon and evening. Shopping, eating, sightseeing all good, although expensive",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YorkShirley
40,Must do,"Unfortunately when I visited Santa Monica Bay is was extremely foggy, however, I still recommend visiting. It was still great to wander around and see the pier. I'm sure it would have been lovely on a nice sunny day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cookiesncream27
50,Great,"Great experience! I had the opportunity of being there more than once. Totally worth! I found it better than visiting Beverly Hills and others overrated places in L.A area. The amusement park is fun and the beach really pretty. I went to a really good restaurant near by with yummy vegan options but I can't really remember the name right now. Just remember to bring a jacket even during the summer, it's a little chilly and actually really cold during the winter.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pricyla
40,somewhere you don't have to drive!,"a lovely walk/skate/run with beautiful views. The bay is a lovely and there is a vibrancy that you don't find on most sea fronts. The people are friendly and when the sun is shining its a lovely way to spend the day! It is a popular tourist destination but you don't feel surrounded by tourists, more like one of the locals!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/samiraLBhales
50,Great holiday location,"Unlike much of the rest of LA, you can actually walk here! There's a beach prom, a higher cliff (bluff) prom through the Palisades, a pedestrianised retail street and plenty of sidewalks. Bliss! It's a beautiful location with wonderful beaches. The pier and fairground might not be to everyone's taste but it's entertaining at any time of the day. There are excellent sea front hotels and a good selection of restaurants - which you don't have to drive to! Definitely recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MSH-Sussex
50,Fabulous,I will never get bored of Santa Monica!A lovely beach and an iconic pier which you will find in many films throughout the years.It is a popular destination for tourists but there is a large sense of calm in the area that makes for a very chilled out visit.At night time the area follows that of the day with a chilled out vibe than you will find back in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/86MarkB86
40,"Nice Scenery, Lots to do","Nice drive through Santa Monica, Stopped at the pier , it was nice , lots to do. Definitely reccomend heading out here if you are near. Beautiful scenery, scenic. Gets a little dumpy as you head towards venice beach, but you can definitely spend a day here!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cksteeve
40,Beautiful scenery,"Very nice place for a walk - beautiful scenery, and the pier has many fun things to do. I agree that it is one of the best things to do in LA, especially if you just want to relax, rest and have a coffee or drink.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/50415
50,Fun on the pier.,We finished our 5 week holiday in America in Santa Monica. With only a short walk from the Santa Monica Pier we visited it every day we were there playing in the arcade and doing rides for the kids.We watched beautiful sunsets as the day passed on and toured down town during the night shopping and stopping for cocktails then shopping some more.Definitely a place to visit if you don't stay there on you holiday.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ConfusiousGuy
50,Best thing in LA,"I caught a couple of buses to Santa Monica Pier and I am so glad I did, this is by far the best thing in LA! The pier is fun and the walk to Venice Beach is just the best. I don't know what else to say, just bring your camera and sunscreen and you're all set :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarijkeLondon
50,Beautiful!,"I had a lovely evening here. I went down onto the pier, got a funnel cake and jumped on the Ferris wheel. It was beautiful and an iconic thing to see. A must visit",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CassandraK777
40,Interesting,"Took a stroll and a look at the bay just after landing, stretch the legs and get some air sort of thing. Very interesting place to wander along the path that follows the coast, beware of bikes, rollerblades etc. Some of the shops are a little different and ""out there"". A very pleasant and leisurely introduction to L.A.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rodgerskay
30,Expected more,"Visited Santa Monica Pier on an October vacation. The weather couldn't have been more perfect! Sunny and warm (around 75 degrees). My friend and I went out to LA to see some sights and while there we took a double deck bus tour and got off at the Pier. I have to say I was a little disappointed in the length of the pier expecting much more. I've always heard about Santa Monica Pier and expected many more shops and better places to eat. Most of it seemed like the small hamburger joints with just a couple of decent sit down restaurants which we did not dine in due to the number of people waiting for a table. I understand there are restaurants near the pier but we wanted to experience what was actually ON the pier. Even the souvenir shops were a bit of a disappointment for this shopper! But we managed to find a shop with loads of t-shirts right across the way from the pier at the beginning of it all that fulfilled my shopping experience.We also did not walk over to where the rides were because I'm no longer into the ride attractions anymore.All in all I'm glad we visited. We got to stick our toes in the cold Pacific Ocean and sit on the sands to catch some rays and people watch. Luckily in October it was not very crowded at all.I was also thrilled to see the sign that said it was the end of Route 66 because that's also a dream of mine to travel Rt 66 as far as it goes. At least I got to see where it all ends, lol ! I just wish my camera didn't need to be charged so I could have gotten a picture of the sign! Maybe when I travel it someday! Here's hoping...........",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Luvthedesert22
50,"Beautiful, fun, full of character.","Visited Santa Monica bay and pier first in August 2013 and it was crowded, but beautiful and a great place to spend a few hours. Compared to other parts of LA (Hollywood/Downtown) Santa Monica is a beautiful area, great to have a meal or a drink and watch the view. Returned in mid-September, needed a jumper but the sun was still out and the crowds had gone. Still beautiful. Short ride from the LAX hotels too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/speake53
40,fave jogging spot,"santa monica beach is a good place to chill or working out after a day plenty of work and stress.Not the best beach to have a total relax because of tourists using the Pier to hang out, however is closed to the 3rd promenade and to the centre of the neighborhood.Walking or cycling from this spot to Venice B, Marina and manhattan beach is totally a must.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LCtravels14
40,Quaint beach town,Just a short trolley ride from LAX area. A place to relax and get away from the hustle and bustle of the city for a sunset stroll or meal in one of many restaurants.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dbelles
50,Beautiful,Serenity!! Beautiful place and great view. I could just lay on the beach everyday. Area is very clean. Family friends couples would all enjoy this place,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Stefymoni
40,Nice walking and biking trails,"We walked and cycled the stretch from Manhattan beach through to the end on Santa Monic. There are some great areas of architecture, and some really tacky parts along the beachfront.The marina at Marina del Playa is a good place to gawk at some magnificent boats, or hire a sailboat and kayak and paddle around this huge marina",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BruceM599
40,Nice place to rent bikes and enjoy the area,The boardwalk goes for miles of easy riding. Santa Monica pier has overpriced rides and restaurants.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vacationlady1
30,Unique.,"The coastline is fabulous, clean beach... We got there at about 5/6 pm when the sun was setting and it was just fab to see the sun set. The entertainment at different sections of the pier was cool. The rides for kids are overpriced and you have to pay for parking. It was reassuring to see Santa Monica police at different parts of the bay. At around 8pm, lots of people were arriving to watch a song festival going on. All in all we had a lovely evening there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/slimbeau
30,Don't go in winter,"If you never seen the sea before, Santa Monica Bay might give you some surprises. But it's not so good in my mind. Nothing special there. It's windy in winter.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SSLOVEKK
50,beautiful seaside,the bay is a nice and beautiful place where you can relax either sitting and sunbathing on the beach or shopping nearby. A very unique atmosphere!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christiano_10
30,Okay,Thought the rides etc were over priced.... The entertainment along pier was interesting. Needs work done to pier as run down.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Blewbay
30,Just ok....,"We consider ourselves beach aficionados, and have visited almost every popular and/or celebrated beach resort along the east coast from Maine to the Floriday keys. We specifically went to California and traveled Rt 1 from Dana Point to Monterey CA in search of the perfect beach/coastal vista. While we definitely found what we were looking for, it wasn't in Santa Monica.While we much preferred Santa Monica to Downtown LA/Hollywood, the beach and the pier is just ok -- nothing special at all, and the local hotels and restaurants are certainly not worth the prices they charge. What's more, Santa Monica is still very far from LA/Hollywood, so if you're looking for a place to stay that is local to both beach and Hollywood, unfortunately Santa Monica isn't it. If you are looking for the comprehensive SoCal experience, my suggestion would be to spend one night at a Hollywood hotel and then transfer to a beach resort in Ocean County (such as Laguna or Doheny), which has more upscale lodging, magnificient vistas, and excellent dining.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/442mariec
40,A pretty good time,"It's not the best beach in the area but it's above average. Crowded in areas especially around Santa Monica and Venice Beach, but head towards Venice out of Santa Monica a bit and you'll find a better place to beach if you like it less crowded. There is a pier in Santa Monica but there's not much there except a handful of rides. The best bike rental place I've found in the area is located right at the base of the boardwalk - across from the snake statue kids like to play on - I believe the name is Sea Mist rentals. I suggest taking half a day or more, renting bikes and riding between Santa Monica and Venice Beach. (Note: A quick stroll through Venice is all you'll need. Do a little people watching but it's pretty gritty comparatively.)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lovelyjamilew
40,Loved Santa Monica,We spent 2 days at Santa Monica .Our initial plan was to spend a single day but we so enjoyed the beach and the peir we scheduled a second day .We walked the walk way .Spent time at the 3rd Street Promenade and the mall .The pier was cool .We rode the ferris wheel .The view was great .Santa Monica was a joy to behold .Go .You will like it .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tomchuck19
30,Nothing special,Beach and bike path great. I am sure the views are great if you can get a day that isn't cloudy/foggy - it can be bright blue sky and hot sun 1 mile inland but chilly and grey on the bay. The pier was disappointing/on the verge of tacky with fast food joints round every corner. The street entertainment and stalls were not as good as Venice boardwalk. Third Street shopping was nothing special. We thought the whole place would be a little more refined than it actually was.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jan179
40,A fun way to spend an evening.,"We visited Santa Monica Pier one evening in late May when we were in LA for 2 days. After the glitzy glam of Hollywood Walk of Fame, Beverly hills, and Rodeo drive, this was a perfect serene place to spend the evening.Parking was convenient to find. We spent our time walking up and down the beach, then explored the pier which has a Ferris wheel and roller coaster right on the pier and is beautiful in the evening.Loved the place!! There were street performers, and singers who were actually quiet good. Caught a beautiful sunset and then headed to the 3rd street and had a very memorable Mexican meal at Mercado's. Will definitely be back and this time will surely get on the roller coaster. :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PoojaP270
30,Enjoyable but I have been to better,"We enjoyed at day in Santa Monica and spend most of our time walking the beach, the pier was good but not great, we had a nice meal in a Mexican restaurant at the sea end. However I wished afterwards we had chosen to explore a different area with a bit more to do. The sea front shops were cool and the street performances made it interesting but all in all I have been to better.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NickyT948
50,Well nice,"We loved Santa Monica, we have never done the West coast, and it was our first time seeing the Pacific Ocean, and it was well worth the trip. Santa Monica was clean and the people seemed nice, we walked along the beach I had a paddle, it was 4.00pm and the sea was still warm, no litter and the sea was clear. we walked along the pier,had a coffee and watched the world go by this place did not disappoint. we parked the car on the beach front car park about £6.00 for the days parking great value.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kr117
40,Worth Seeing But...,"We stopped by when taking a week long visit to the Malibu and LA area. The parking situation is good as there is a large lot right on the beach and there is copious room along the large beach expanse as well.With regard to the pier, our experience as out of towners was ""ok"". It was busy and there were some shops and places to eat, though nothing that really held our interest. We eventually walked to the Third Street Promenade, which is only a short distance away.Overall the combination of great parking, easy beach access, the pier and access to Santa Monica make this a nice attraction. That being said we enjoyed the pier, harbor and restaurant experience in Santa Barbara a great deal more than this one.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aroundomaha
40,Great time!,"It was my first time seeing the Pacific Ocean and the Santa Monica Pier did not disappoint. It was too cool to get in the water, but my wife mingled with the locals and shared an ice cream cone on the pier. We will definitely make a return visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D0nteT
50,The Place where you can close to Pacific Ocean,"Nice pier located next to Pacific Ocean. Boardwalk is good, you may see many street artists playing music there. Also you can get on some rides at the Pier, but have to buy tickets. Many people were chilling there not just tourists. Its nice place to spend with family and friends.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JJnish
40,Nice tourist place to visit,Unfortunately we had a VERY windy day so a little too cool & a lot of sand blowing around - otherwise a great place for tourists !,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/166LindaH166
40,Contradiction,"Yes, it is dirty, cold and often foggy. But the Bay is a great urban space at the nation's edge. You can ride your bike for miles along the beach front. In the afternoon, the light here is magnificent as it hits the water and the hills. That light is unique.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RTW72
50,Pier and City at night,"Santa Monica is a nice city located near LA and next to the Pacific Ocean, at night the city looks really interesting, take a walk thru the city and go to the beach and the Pier is real nice to have a walk on",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traveller-solo_com
50,Beautiful,"I loved this place, beautiful beach and scene. Definitely worth it. Take as many pictures as you can. It was the first time I saw the pacific ocean.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OrEg0n
40,Nice!,It kind of looks like every beach in US that I ever visited - long and sandy :)But this one has some charm. It has couple of places to buy food or drinks and it's very lively so I would definitely recommend to visit :),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JasnaM798
50,The coastal drive,"We drove from Malibu along the Pacific Coast Highway-beautiful. Parking was only 6 bucks at the pier and that was pretty cool, too. It was all better than I thought, after seeing the Hollywood Blvd area first. I'm from Chicago, so that's where Rt 66 starts and they have a sign on the pier marking the end. Street performers and artists selling their goods. It was awful windy. They views were amazing, watching the waves pound the shore. Clean beach and pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/roadtripperAmerica
40,Very nice,All the movies you saw that were ambiented in this wonderful place come to mind when you walk arround. The place is not really clean but hey there is so much people here that is a miracle that there isnt more trash,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/esvian
40,high end prices,This is a great city on the coast the pier is one of the best west of jersy and the shopping on third street is second to none. the mall is high end and everything cost an arm and a leg. the food in the area is top of the line and it is crowded all the time. lot's of street crafts and entertainment.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/steveandlisaK
40,Santa Monica,Santa Monica is a lovely place. There are sooo many people visiting anymore that it's really too hard to park and the sales tax is impossibly high. The view though from Ocean Ave is lovley and the walk along the promenade is lovely.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GaryD879
40,Beautiful Sunsets!,Shutters on the Beach is just one of the places to enjoy the view. Drive to the Santa Monica Pier on PCH. You may even see a dolphin or two.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cayman08
50,different vibe...,"I wish i spent more time in Santa Monica Bay, nice places to see, good restaurants to eat and beatiful people to see. Different vibe from where i'm from (MIA), the sunset always gives it a more picturesque view than the Atlantic ocean. You can also see lots of artists around from caricaturists and sculptors. There was a chinese sculptor at the boardwalk that makes amazingly identical/looked alike head sculptors in 10-15 min.

50,This is what makes LA,"LA is all about the water, and the bay is everything. Beaches from Malibu past Palos Verdes into Orange County, the strand. Bike riding, running, walking, surfing, sand, it's all here. Not to mention Venice Beach and it's side show",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/uphill01
50,Another must do,"Our trip consisted of 2 adults starting in New York and ending in San Francisco.During our 3 week trip Hurricane Sandy had just left to be followed by a severe NE snow storm. President Obama had been re-elected and I managed to change my status from single to married!We went toNew YorkLas VegasLos AngelesSanta MonicaCarmelSan Francisco.Santa Monica is one of the very few places on this earth that I have seen and thought, I could live here!A relaxing era about the place, don't know if it was we had come in from Vegas but the first walk out onto the beach was delightful. We went to Bubba Gumps, at the end of Route 66, yep a tourist haunt but that was what we were! Served by Rat who was brilliant! Then a walk along the wooden pier and back to the hotel. In the morning on a LAsightseeing tour which ticked all the boxes off the places we wanted to see without having the hassle of finding places to park all the time.Decided to stay an extra night in Days Inn Santa Monica which was again very nice.The people round here seem to be very friendly after the brashness of NYC and the falseness of Vegas.I will be back here, it was a lovely place",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lbproperties

40,Great family place,Love people watching at this type of place. Very clean beach and fun entertainment along the pier. Avoid the bumper cars-hardly working and disappointing to kids. Rides are expensive. Walked over to Third St. and interesting street entertainment and wide variety of shops and restaurants.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/prindy52
50,Fantastic.,Gorgeous beach!!! There are apparently tons of prohibited activities (playing frisbee for one..) but who cares? There are plenty of other beaches if that's what you're after. Santa Monica beach is well kept & perfect for people watching. There's plenty of fun you can have here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Julesy2988
40,I'm not a beach bunny...,This area is lovely and there is a terrific bike-path on which you can occasionally get away with roller-blading.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KayT917
50,Must hire a bike,We visited Santa Monica in the afternoon and went straight to the bike hire shop.We hired a tandem bike and rode all the way up past Venice beach and enjoyed all the funky people and shops along the way.Then watched the sunset off the pier and it was spectacular.This was my 2nd time here and will come back again if in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jimiUnanderra

40,Beautiful Bay Views,The best thing about Santa Monica Bay are the scenic views at sunset. Get a table at the Lobster (right at the first step of the SM Pier) and watch out the window as the sun dips below the water line. Breathtaking!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AHSwift
50,Very pretty beach,The pier and bay are a nice way to spend some time - try to arrive early (before 9) for better parking. Things pick up from about 10am.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JacJac82
50,supposedly more upmarket than Venice....,".... compare and contrast.... history says the houses and beaches of Venice have benefitted from the ripple effect of Santa Monica's success. Santa Monica is a fantastic place, the bay is amazing, but in my view I prefer Venice. That said, this is still a stunning place. Larry Hagman lives here, so it's gotta be good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/major_rawls
40,"Love the beach, just check the sewage report before diving in","It's so pretty here! The beach is fairly clean and when the water is clean, it's really refreshing. Nice bike path and good looking lifeguards!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/preciouspinkxxx
50,A lovely day by the beach,"Visited as a day trip while staying in downtown LA and had such a nice day. There's so much to do! Visited the amusement park, sat on the sand, rented a bike and spent a few hours bike riding, wandered around the shops and had dinner and a drink before heading back. The bike ride was my favorite part. Bike rentals were really inexpensive; I think it was $15 for the entire afternoon including a lock and a helmet. There is a long paved trail along the ocean which takes you by Venice Beach as well as much quieter, more peaceful sections. There's a lot to do even if it isn't a perfect 'beach day'.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BostonChloe
40,Must go in the Summertime,"Santa Monica beach is a definite must go to beach in the summertime, even in the winter time (December), it's a awesome beach. Heaps of space, lots of activities (Volleyball, cycling, surfing etc), There's always something happening. The day that we went there were at least four film sets there.Santa Monica itself is great! so clean and safe (of course there's the occasional homeless person, as with anywhere in the Los Angeles area). Great shopping and accommodation. Good for families.I'd definitely recommend spending a few nights in the Santa Monica if you're in the Los Angeles area. The closer to the beach, generally the better.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/284BrianT
30,Just another SoCal beach.,"I grew up in SoCal so going to the beach was a normal way of life. I got to know every beach in three counties. This beach is ok. It doesn't stand out as something amazing compared to some of the other beaches because it's geared more towards the commercial side of things. There's stores, shops, and restaurants all over the place, but the beach itself is just a long slab of sand on the ocean, nothing private or cozy, and nothing you can't find just about everywhere else in SoCal.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeneeW

I'll bet the water is (relatively) warm here in the summer!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amercorp

50,We dive the Santa Monica Bay,We use boats that leave from Marina Del Rey for these Santa Monica Bay diving trips. Usually we dive the star of Scotland wreck which has an interesting history as a covert ops war ship and later an offshore speakeasy. It lies in 70 feet of water about 2 miles from the Santa Monica Pier,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hollywoodivers
50,Enjoyed the Pier. Too short of a visit.,"After seeing many pictures of the Santa Monica Pier in travel magazines and photo contests, I wanted to visit Santa Monica. In doing research, it sounded like Santa Monica Pier and the beach were a fun spot to visit both day and night. Venice Beach, boardwalk, and canals are only a short distance away, and were also highly recommended by everything I read, and many people I met. Unfortunately, I was on a very short time schedule. I had spent the morning at the Getty Museum and then traveled down to Long Beach to see the Queen Mary. I had hoped to arrive in Santa Monica a bit earlier. However, by the time I arrived in Santa Monica, it was dark and the only thing I had the chance to do was visit the Pier. I loved watching and taking pictures of the kaleidoscope of changing colors of the ferris wheel. It was really beautiful. I imagine the view of the Pier at sunset is breathtaking. It was also fun being in the middle of all the activity of the amusements. The end of Route 66 is on the Pier, and its post became another photo opportunity. There were a few nice restaurants on the Pier (Bubba's Shrimp Co., was one) but when it started to drizzle, I decided to get on the road before it started to rain harder. I want to definitely go back to Santa Monica and also visit Venice Beach and its canals, and take a drive up to Malibu when I visit LA again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/caram30
40,Santa Monica is great for all ages.,"We went there as a family of 5 kids aged 9-13, We hired bikes and rode from the Santa monica pier along the bike path to Venice beach pier.(pick a bike with a basket if your into shopping,) it may come in handy. We then stopped on way back parking up our bikes while shopping .had no problems it's all very casual and anything goes. Lots to see on the way like the muscle beach gym scatepark and an interesting park on the beach where you see enthusaStic gymnasts swing effortlessly and tipe rope being done near the pier at Santa Monica . Close by is good shopping just about a street away from mc donalds. Holiday inn is an awesome place to stay ,very close to everything and quiet and very safe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cockos
50,Lots to do,"I always park at the 3rd st promenade garage and get my tkt validated. Walk to the pier and choose a direction. Go right towards Malibu or left towards Venice. I personally like Venice direction best. You can walk, run, roller skate/blade, or rent a bike and cruise along. Make sure you stay for sunset! Thats the best part!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nolaqueen
30,Nice stroll down the Pier. Route 66 officially ends here!,"Santa Monica is a lovely, clean beach. We parked in the short stay car park before the pier, 2 hours was $2. We walked along the pier to the official end of Route 66. There are a few rides and places to eat along the pier.It was nice to grab something to eat and just sit on the pier, relaxing.There are not many shops, for shops go to Venice Beach.It's a lovely place to relax but not much else to do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PassportUK
