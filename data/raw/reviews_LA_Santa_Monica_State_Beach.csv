40,Nice beach,"Visited Santa Monica beach on our way to LA from Las Vegas on our US trip with SOTC group. Santa Monica is a coastal city west of Los Angeles. Santa Monica Beach has Palisades Park with views over the Pacific Ocean and through the park, you can approach beaches. From the entrance, there is a straight walk up to the end of the pier facing Pacific ocean. You will find restaurants, amusement park, games & rides and other attractions on either side of the road. Beaches are sandy and clean. There is enough parking available. we had spent couple of hours there. It was bright sunny day and full of people & tourists. A very popular beach and must see.",cp_0010

40,Nice beach with beautiful sand,Nice beach with beautiful sand and good water for a paddle/bodyboard. It can get a bit busy around the pier side though but great for kids and adults. Ample parking but expensive by the pier.,Claire M
50,Huge beach - clean and tidy,Just off the pier is this fantastic wide beach which seems to go on forever. It was clean and tidy and very quiet.,Clarkie
50,Beautiful Santa Monics,The beach at Santa Monica is one of the cleanest and most spacious beaches I've ever seen. There are acres of sand. There are lifeguard stations and free restrooms. The beach path has cafes with food and beverages. Volleyball nets are everywhere and you can work out on the rings and other equipment. The view of the ocean and northward towards Malibu is beautiful! Everyone comes here. Parking is expensive. I recommend parking at a lot in town and walking a few blocks.,susannedanc
50,Beautiful,"Great beach, near the pier if you need entertainment. It does get crowded and parking gets full, so get there early",Becky RTS
50,Clean and smart - like a Californian Beach should be,"Miles of perfect sand, clean and smooth. Wide concrete boardwalk for cycles and scooters. There is sun, sand, seagulls and seaside! What could be bad",Wardieeee
50,Beautiful,Beautiful beach. Plenty of facilities. I'd advise to hire out a bike and cycle from the Santa Monica Pier right up to Venice Beach and back. A well maintained cycling path with breath taking scenery. Nice atmosphere. Everyone enjoying themselves.You can hire a bike on the actual pier.Don't miss out!,Adam M
50,Nice,"It was beautiful out there! A little chilly though seeing as the wind made it colder. Bring a jacket, you'll be fine. We played in the water a bit, they have a station where you can wash your feet off.",Marissa C
50,Beautiful Beach!,The beach was very clean! We enjoyed our time there immensely. Lifeguards were on duty and there was policemen on duty as well. Very safe,Aprilla
40,Great beach,"The Santa Monica State Beach is a pretty long stretch of beach, and there are paid parking lots down it - with bathrooms and restaurants and playgrounds as well. When visiting LA with my husband and brother this past weekend, I knew I couldn't leave California without walking along the beach and taking in some ocean views. So we picked a parking lot ($7 for the day on a Tuesday; it was pretty empty) and walked along the beach for a bit. It was a grayish day, but it was still lovely to walk along the beach and watch and smell the ocean before heading back to wintery, rainy, gray Nashville. If your visit includes weekdays, I suggest visiting on the beach on a weekday - it was pretty empty! Very relaxing place to visit!",alexisrachelletx
50,The best,"This is the best beach in the United States that is adjacent to a large city. Big, clean, blue water, great waves.",Armen Pandola
40,Holy cow neat!,This was my first time going here! Very different from the beaches in Florida and Hawaii that I've been to. Definitely a place to go off season and off days not weekends! Lots to do with the boardwalk an Pier close by!,onehotdj
50,A nice beach but we have too less time for,"It is a nice beach with big open area to play sands, especially it is great for our young students this time. Next time we could plan a longer time for this trip.",TibetLocalGuide.COM
50,Enjoyed an evening paddle,"Walking from Venice we had splendid vistas of the ocean and beach as we approached the famous pier. It looked beguiling in the evening light.We enjoyed a paddle in the refreshing water. We weren’t alone, many visitors were enjoying the delightful experience.",permia
40,Nice Beach,"This is a really nice beach, and it's close to Venice Beach as well, so I recommend visiting both on the same trip.",Mark42139
40,Peaceful spacious beach,This beach is great. Very spacious and full of peace. Although there are things going on around you there there is a strong connection with nature. A great relax from the city life. Toilets at the beach and showers. Police driving through regularly to patrol. Water is a bit cold and it can be windy at times but it is fascinating when the fog rolls in.,tara
30,Vacation,Beautiful beach and views. Seems like they try hard to keep the beach area clean but so many people obviously make it a challenge. Nice to walk the beach though and take in the views,Adam G
30,Large beach and close to other things,"Santa Monica is not the beach I go to if the beach is the main thing. This is a beach I go to in combination with doing the third street promenade, or sometimes before I go to LAX. There is a paved path along the beach which is great if you want to ride a bike, skate board or roller skates, or if you just don’t want sand on your feet.The beach is big and can host a lot more people than the surrounding parking can suffice.",Rob-CS
50,"VIBRANT BEACH LOCATION, LIKE YOU SEE IN THE MOVIES!","Santa Monica Beach is hands down one of our favourite places in the world. It's vibrant, full of life, colour and has some of the most beautiful, unique views you will ever come across.Overall the beach is clean and people respect the beach rules, it has cute shops and restaurants along the beach road and is frequented by some of the coolest, quirkiest people around. Our favourite is Big Dean's which is located to the bottom of the pier (towards the right hand side if you are walking off).Once on the pier you have various different restaurants to choose from (our favourites being Bubba Gump & Seaside on the Pier). There are also some cool street performers and the fabulous Pacific Park (theme park) to keep you entertained. You may recognise Pacific Park from various different films/TV shows as it's used quite a lot during filming for it's beautiful views at sunset).A lot of people rent bikes out for the day and cycle from Santa Monica/Venice and vice-a-versa. It is a beautiful, scenic little bike-ride that takes around 20 mins. There are plenty of places to leave your bike at the beach (as long as you've got a suitable lock which the bike companies usually provide you with upon hire).There are a lot of homeless people in Venice Beach (most of whom are on drugs of some kind) that pretty much set themselves up at the beach or live there permanently. They use the showers/bathrooms as if they were their own and leave them in quite a mess. Overall it's not a problem – but where possible to try avoid them if you can as (if they are on something) you could end up putting yourself in true danger.At Santa Monica Beach however there doesn't seem to be this issue. All rest-rooms are cleaned and foot showers/showers are cleaned daily.Overall Santa Monica Beach is beautiful. It is the perfect family day out and can also be very romantic. We are already looking forward to our next visit.Instagram: @journeywithuss",JourneyWithUss
50,Beautiful,"Amazing view, the sunset is not to be missed. Great to walk around the beach on a lazy afternoon. Can fit in a day trip with Santa Monica to Venice Beach",Lovegoodfoodgoodwine

50,Hired bikes and off we rode.,"Loved this bike ride along the people. Only had a few bear misses with ignorant pedestrians! Clean, easy and fabulous views. Worth the day out of LA to visit.",Shallwegothere
50,Best beaches in LA,"Long perfectly groomed beaches with the mountains providing great scenery while watching the waves roll in. Plus, ample parking and easy access to other parts of LA; it’s hard to not have a great day at the SaMo beaches. You also have easy access to restaurants and bars if you want to extend your beach day (and plenty of shopping too). Local tip: avoid the parts of the beach closest to the pier. An easily accessible from the 10 and large parking lot right there means it gets really crowded. For a less crowded experience drive up toward the Palisades or down toward Venice. LGBTQ+ tip: the gay beach (Ginger Rogers) is right on the border of SaMo and the Palisades across from Patrick’s Roadhouse.",cjfbruno
50,Beautiful,"Santa Monica beach is so beautiful. The views were awesome, the beach was clean and peaceful. I will definitely return when it’s warmer to enjoy the beautiful water!",Seanee R
50,Mesmerizing Sunset,"The last day of our honeymoon, my husband and I decided to watch the sunset over the ocean. We live on the East Coast, so this is something we had never had the pleasure of doing. I must say it was the most beautiful sunset I have ever witnessed. The way the colors reflected on the water, the sounds of the waves crashing. I wish we would have spent every night of our honeymoon, on that beach, in that spot, watching that sunset. I look forward to coming back to Santa Monica Beach, not for the pier, not for the Santa Monica life, but for that sunset.",Claire McManus

50,Nice beach,"We just hopped down to get a chance at the end of our holliday to get in the ocean. Although it was pretty cold, sbout 20 Celsius, it was clean with nice waves. About 10 meters from us 2 dolphins showrd up, first we got really scared, thought they were sharks. Not many people in November.",LeslieP69
50,Love it!,"Must go and see this place! Muscle beach is fun & it is just lovely to walk down the pier, you can walk from here to Venice easily too.",Jack W
20,It’s a beach.,"That said, it’s crowded, litter-filled, noisy, and not at all pristine. If you can get there, drive a little farther to the more remote, beautiful options.",c r
50,Beautiful place to visit,"As I was only passing through for a day while on my holiday, I took the tip from my friend and went on a Monday (avoiding the locals getting away for their weekend). There was barley anyone on the beach and it was really peaceful. The pier was still really busy. If you are a surfer you will love the sea but it’s a little too rough for a casual swim or to leave children in it alone. There are public restrooms all the way along the walkway which are handy for changing in as well as filling up your water bottle and showering of the sand. Lifeguards patrol this beach. Bring your own umbrella and chair or hire one from the shops located along the walkway. You can walk all the way to Venice beach is you wish or you can just go into Santa Monica town and shop or eat. This beach is well worth a visit! It’s as great as it looks in the pictures. Can’t wait to come back and spend more time there.",Mel
50,Beautiful location,Beautiful. we visited there in midnight . Good music in surroundings and lots of food stalls are near by.,srishti
50,Seldom too crowded,This state beach is very big. Parking is usually convenient in one of the close by parking slots. The are homeless people but the are harmless. Overall the beach is safe thanks to local law enforcement’s presence. Good bike paths. Swimming is of course recommend as long as you are aware of and respect the warnings visibility presented.,BeachStone2C
50,Long Wide Beach,Convenient parking with lots of food either on the adjacent pier or along Ocean Blvd.Great are to enjoy the SoCal ambiance.,zapprint
10,Too high of expectations,Visited here during our California trip and was disappointed. Not like it was seen on pictures/media. Very busy and didn’t feel like a beautiful coastal beach. Enjoyed the beaches further south so much better!!,#wanderexplorediscover❤️
50,I love Santa Monica,Don't stay in hollywood or Beverly hills.Santa Monica is both classy and relaxed. The beach is great and roomy.,Christer B
50,Beautiful scenery,What a treat-the pier is remarkable and still made of wood floors. There are cafes out on the pier that are all worth a visit. Entertainment is happening and fun. Off the pier there’s a walkway along side the beach that winds it’s way down to Venice Beach via Muscle Beach.There are plenty of fabulous restrooms that are clean and well stocked.The views from the beach across the Pacific Ocean are breathtaking and revitalising.,CAJMR05
50,Great beach,This beach was fun. Beach was clean and very big and wide. You have a little bit of a walk from parking area or a local hotel. Lots of room to relax and have fun. Water was very cool and enjoyable for a hot day in LA.,dton93

50,Large beach with plenty of space for sunbathing + an amazing running path,We ran along the path past Santa Monica State beach and were very impressed with how clean and clear the path was.

50,Lovely Santa Monica beach,We really liked the beach and surrounding area. It’s a very deep beach as in quite a distance from path to the waters edge. And with the facilities for Exercise and fitness right on the beach it’s ideal for people if it’s your thing. Great to cycle along or just walk along path.,crow58
40,Enough good,I have not seen any restaurant around to sit and not a cafe! at least about the place I were there. It was a sunny day but not that warm to not enjoy so the weather was excellent to me. I could say I saw some people eating and not cleaning their area and it was a big surprise to me!! because there are many seagull there so they could be in danger. we known they would be waiting for food so we had their food with ourselves. All in all peaceful and enjoyable when not crowded.,Shabnam

50,Santa Monica Beach,"Awesome view of the sunset. If you are in Santa Monica and you are looking for someplace to spend some time with your family, or with your boyfriend / Girlfriend check out this beach. I went here with my boyfriend and it was perfect. I'm pretty sure I wasn't the only one who had a great time! Got some sweet pictures with me and my boyfriend and our bikes",Allison Foster
10,Disappointing and didn't feel safe,"Walked about 30 mins along the beach front from our hotel to the pier. We were approached by someone who made us feel uncomfortable, and then threatened by someone who was obviously drunk and/or high. In general there's just nothing special about this beach, it's rather bland. There are many nicer/more scenic beaches along the Californian coast. Wish we'd skipped Santa Monica and spent more time in Carmel or Pismo.Felt unsafe, uncomfortable and was only bad stay of an otherwise wonderful trip to CA.",Sarah S
30,Not quite paradise,"I think I was expecting more from Santa Monica Beach, beautiful green water of the Pacific Ocean, body beautiful everywhere but this wasn't really the case. Lots of homeless and mentally ill people hang around these parts so not one of my greatest experiences.",Natalie Starling-Booth

10,R.I.P. Santa Monica,"I went to the promenade for the first time in many years today... I cannot believe how disgusting Santa Monica has become. There is a homeless person every 10 feet, stores appear to have closed, and the feeling of the entire place is dirty. 10 years ago there were tons of tourists which is annoying, but the place still felt safe and clean... not anymore.I used to come here to get away from the slop of Hollywood, but this seems like a mere extension of Downtown LA at this point. I’m guessing this has a lot to do with the Metro that allows anyone easy access to the area.Sad to say I’m so disappointed with what Santa Monica has become... an overdeveloped wasteland with a massive homeless population.I won’t be returning here anytime soon.",David G
50,Place with amazing atmosphere,"We visited Santa Monica in March, so not yet a time for swimming and sunbathing but this place just got me with it´s atmosphere. All of those people playing volleyball, jumping on the ropes, working out, riding scooters, ... A place to be in any time of the year. Much better than Venice beach which was all overcrowded (also a lot of homeless people) and dirty.",Daduci

50,LOVE IT BY THE AND BY NIGHT,I love this beach much much more than the Venice Beach since the crowds here are a little bit more sophisticated. There is always plenty of parking spot in the parking lot or on the streets however parking is pricey in this area.,Annaline
50,Santa Monica for 1 day getaway. We drove in from Phoenix Arizona where we were staying at a hotel.,Santa Monica is absolutely awesome. Great waves and great beach. We actually flew in to Az from NYC and drove in a rental to Santa Monica. Really beautiful and also found the end of Route 66 here. Also did notice like many urban U.S cities there was a big amount of homeless living in or around the beach areas.,MsGreentaxilady
50,Clean and surprisingly uncrowded,"I hesitated going to this beach on the Thursday before Labor Day weekend, thinking it would be extremely crowded. I was pleasantly surprised by the fact that it was not at all crowded. The beach was very clean and, given the fact that we were a fair distance from the pier, not noisy. There were lifeguards on duty. All in all, a lovely beach day.",Pat H
40,Beautiful beach. It’s cold!!!,"Santa Monica beach is beautiful but cold. For Canadians going to California, just know this. The warmest part of the year 70 degrees F. Great places to eat and drink. Much nicer than Venice beach.",Randy K

50,So much fun! So pretty!,"We didn't bring swimsuits, but stepping our feet in the water was so much fun! The water looked so beautiful and it was so refreshing. The waves went higher than we expected at times and we got sort of wet but it's a great place to go swimming! There weren't that many lifeguards, however, so if you have kids just keep an eye on them! We did want to go down to Venice beach, but it was too far and we didn't have the time to go. I'm so happy we spent time at the Santa Monica beach! This is a must if you're ever visiting Los Angeles!",Ellie
40,Get to beach all right,"Been coming to this beat since I was a small child and always loved it. It's your typical Southern California beach. I always love the smell of the saltwater and the Roar of the surf. There's not a whole lot to do here but wait around the water and get a sunburn but, I guess that's the whole experience people are looking for. Worth the trip if you like beaches",Old Pro
50,Nice 👍🏾,The pier was full of activities. Really nice. We enjoyed being there. Would recommend to people of all ages.,agcgal
20,Santa Monica Beach,"My daughter and I made a 2-day stop in Santa Monica on our way to San Diego from San Francisco. We woke up early in a Monday morning to take advantage of the beautiful day at the beach. Imagine our disappointment to see so many homeless people on the beach, the park and the pier. A few tents were pitched in the beach and there were a lot of homeless people still sleeping in their sleeping bags at 10:30 am. I felt very uncomfortable setting up our rental chairs and umbrellas since there were more homeless people on the beach than beach goers. I have to say that our stay in Santa Monica was not what we expected it to be. For the amount of money I paid to stay at the Ocean View Hotel (which was amazing), I expected a relaxing time at the beach with my daughter.",Mayet B
40,Nice Beach!,"The Santa Monica Beach is just next to the Santa Monica Pier, which is convenient. There is ample paid parking available. The beach is much more family-friendly as compared to Venice Beach (which is rather sleazy), and thus a better option. The waters are relatively calm, and swimming is permitted. Lifeguards are present. As a tourist, it is better to visit the pier, the beach and the 3rd Promenade on the same day.",ShoaibShawoo
40,Nice beach,Visited on 2 separate days. Nice beach and worth visiting. Quite busy but easy to find a nice spot to set up. Lifeguards are constantly walking their area. Great for people watching too.,Alex A

50,It was wonderful...,"This beach is fantastic more for its atmosphere than for the ocean or beach..The end of the 66 trail is very significant and charming for me stay there.. Full of artists, I was really delighted by one of them in particolar, playing violin in a very emotional way.. In the beach there were many groups of people, listening to music and in some cases dancing.. It was really great for me stay inside all of that.",Lucia S
50,"Beautiful, fun, tons to do","There's a roller coaster and a small carnival like area on the boardwalk (with games and novelties and even open trapeze lessons), tons of shopping and vendors, enough beach access to always find space, high end restaurants and cheaper food, and it's one block away from the main shopping/tourist hub!",Molly S

50,Beautiful flat beach,I come from an area that has nice beaches but this is one of the nicest I have seen. Very smooth flat beach with no rocks to be seen. Very clean as well.

Just walked along the beach getting our feet wet only. Even though we didn't get in there was plenty of people and families who did. We planned on seeing the sunset but unfortunately it was cloudy making the evening cool which was fine with us. Theres lots of vendors which they're food smelled delicious. We didn't like that there's lots of homeless people around staying there and sleeping all over.,Dalia R
50,"Wide & deep, nice sandy beach","Even in the 68F weather there were many people on the beach, on the first Saturday of August. Most seem to be families. The water was a little rough, but not big.

30,First visit,"As a first time visitor to this beautiful city, I was looking forward to seeing the historic Santa Monica pier and beaches.The beaches were infact huge and amazing. The rest not so much.It is a very dirty place, unfortunately lots of homeless and weirdos camped out along the areas leading up to the pier. Garbage all over and the smell of urine and weed surround this area. It’s really sad because the beaches are just amazing. Wife and kids did not feel comfortable.The streets leading towards the Pier, (main road, etc) had great restaurants and shopping and was definitely what I had anticipated.Although beautiful, a little disappointed.J",Jackhammer12345
40,Site of a major volleyball tournament.,The wide level beach is a perfect local for beach volleyball. Sand is perfect and the weather was optimal. Overcast in the morning until 10-11 and the sun emerges.The only issue is the emerging homeless using the beach as their bedroom. The beach is becoming a dangerous one after dark.,A C
50,Best visited in the off season,I best enjoy the beach and the pier in the off season when it is less touristy. A must see for first timers.,Turtle Tree Travels

50,A Must See,"If you visit Santa Monica you have to do the ocean! A few vendors selling boogie boards, umbrellas & ice cream.

The life guards are everywhere too.On weekends it’s mental around the pier area but still has a good vibe. Midweek less busy and easy to find a nice spot. So different to anywhere else I’ve been. Tranquil it’s not, but great fun.",Jonny M
40,Very nice.,I went there twice with kids. Very open spaced and kids friendly. I will go there again tomorrow. Some public parking is cheap but some is rather restricted. One day we got 5$ for unlimited time and today 10$ for about 2 hours. I recommend this beach.,Mr. Piru
50,Lovely!,Certainly a must-see. Beautiful views! Be prepared to spend a few hours here because you'll want to. I love this place and want to come here again during my next vacation! Relaxing.,Rose
40,Beautiful,"A beautiful beach, and when I was there, not too many people. Rather cold, but refreshing water. Memories of soldiers at the beach.",kajsa234
50,Great Beach,"Large beach, palm trees, bike and walking paths. Shopping, restaurants and pier nearby. Plenty of good people-watching.",JD1
50,Crowded,"Very crowded beach. It was beautiful and very clean. Spent a couple of hours there . Close to pier, food and shopping.",rshadrosky
20,Beautfiul but the bums/homeless,We stayed in Santa Monica for the beach primarily. It ended up being a little too chilly for the beach but I walked on the path daily. It was gorgeous but the number of homeless/bums was unsettling. We would not allow our 17 year old daughter to run on the beach because we felt there was a lack of safety. It takes away from the beauty and fun of the beach.,Jammin1985
50,"Well kept, safe and great waves","We spent an afternoon here to recharge our batteries after almost two weeks on the road. Was an immaculate beach, there are bins (including recycling bins) all along the beach and it didn't feel at all crowded. There were constant unobtrusive patrols by lifeguards, police and animal control as well as regular lifeguard stations. The waves were fantastic, unfortunately I didn't have a boogie board or surfboard with me but I would have spent hours using them if I had.",James W
40,Hot,"Hot July day, a little windy.I have only given it 4 stars because the beach needed a little more attention in terms of rubbish collection. It was NOT dirty, just not perfect.I would go again, the boarders and surfers were having a great time.Lifeguards on towers and out to sea on boats.",Ian B
40,Busy,"Busy but fun! Forget your beach gear and buy your towels, water and sand toys for next to nothing. Very busy for 2 PM on a weekday but worth it!",BeachQueen
30,Marine fog...?,"We lived up in Hollywood Hills, where we enjoyed a beautiful sunshine in the morning, but when approaching the beach it became quite foggy and cold, almost like a smog layer all over the beach area. This happened twice this week. And as soon as we came back to Hollywood, we could enjoy the blue sky and sun again.Apart from the marine fog the beach were nice, soft sand, lots of space and life guards, which is really good with all the high waves. I wouldn't let small children bath here though, because of the waves.",Anne
50,Great beach,Good family beach with lots of room to spread out. The area was clean and safe. Has a nostalgic feel to it which I loved.,EG54
50,Great Stretch of Sand and Surf,"My only complaint here is that the sand is so wide it takes longer to get to the water......but overall, the beach is clean, and people tend to acknowledge personal space rather than set up right on top of you. The water in July is chilly, but once in, feels refreshing. Body surfed and surfed while there, both were tiring but enjoyable. Lifeguards on duty, but unless you go out super deep, I doubt they get much action, as the waves break well out.Riptides were present, so if you are going with kids, best to keep an eye on them. Would love a few more days just sitting there.",Rick D
10,Utter filth!,"Going to be brutally honest. The beach was disgusting. I picked up used nappies, plastic toys, even a wig and threw them onto dry sand (so they didn't go back into the ocean) as my hand bag was already full of rubbish for the nearest bin. PLACE BINS CLOSER TO BEACH GOES! Too crowded.",Boobs68
50,One of the best.,"This Beach is excellent with miles of golden Sand that is looked after. There are many areas with free sport facilities and for fitness.There are several restrooms so no need to pee in the Sand and there are several places to sit, eat and drink.Again many homeless people walking, siting or lying around and pretty good Police presence.This is a safe place to visit but maybe not at night and gets extremely busy during the weekend.",johnmG8857TP
40,Nice stroll along the boardwalk,We stayed at a hotel close by so got to stroll along the beach. Its a huge beach and they have a separate biking path. I saw several public restrooms and showers. There are also exercise equipment like monkey bars for the health conscious. There are bikes and other swimming equipment for rent. The only thing is that there are a lot of homeless along the stretch of the beach walk although i feel safe because i see the police going around in their vehicles. The beach area is relatively clean and i saw a lot of public parking lots along the way.,Gee Selle
40,Great beach,They make a big effort to present a clean beach and do it well. Worth a few hours walking up and down taking in the sights.Surprised us how many homeless people were there begging. Not nice. Other than that it’s spot on.,Andy
50,"Beautiful weather, nice beach","I had heard the water was cold, and it definitely was! The sand was great, the beach was clean, the weather was perfect. It was a great relaxing day overall. We all 7 got sunburned though - not the beach's fault. We are from Texas where it's hot and the sun burns quickly. The temp on the beach was 70 and we had never been anywhere on the Pacific and didn't know what to expect and applied our sunscreen too late. Live and learn. It was still the best time of our one-week vacation.",JohnsGirl87
50,We Go Often,Santa Monica State Beach is administered by the City of Santa Monica from Will Rogers State Beach south to Venice. This makes a difference when you see the way the facilities are cleaner and have different hours. Venice Beach closes early and Santa Monica Beaches never close. You can take a night walk and feel pretty safe even after the Pier closes. There are a couple of small wave surf breaks but go to SMSB for long walks and ample parking.,Mitchel N
50,Always there,"Bike, vball, beer, girls, ultimate frisbee, what can't you do on this glorious strip of beach? Well the surf is pretty poor most of the time, and the locals will try to steal your girlfriend, but sometimes that's a good thing.",Zachary Matz
40,Clean and plenty of room.,We have never had problems on the beach. There are several homeless people but they don’t bother you. Bathrooms are kinda dirty but there are people cleaning as they can. Parking is plentiful.,ColbyHannah

20,Santa Monica Beach,"There was plenty of parking and it is cheap. It looked clean. We didn't get to swim because of time, we just wanted to see the ocean. It was a long walk. Very pretty.",Dee Johnson
40,Fun,Overall the beach is really nice. There is a lot of space and parking. There are public RR. I only gave it 4 stars because of the trash on the beach. It wasn't a lot but it included broken glass and some gross items.,Lisa G
50,Had a blast,"The day started off colder than I wanted it to be for a day at the beach, but it warmed up and the sun came out and we had a fun day at the beach. Parking was an issue but we we able to find some at 4th and Pico. It cost us $5 for several hours at the beach. Totally worth it and the little walk to the beach. The waves were fun today with the kids. The life guards were friendly, they had to talk to us twice. Once because we were swimming in a surf zone and another time because some of the kids were wearing life jackets. We complied and we still had a great time.",pkbrady
50,"Nice, chilled clean beach","Nice, chilled and clean beach with lots of restaurants nearby. The sea is cold at this time however!",Sam L
40,HUGE BEACH,Huge beach with great sand a great view. ONLYsad thing is that when we walked it at night it was littered and had many smoking marijuana which I did not want my daughter to experience.,jcdeligirl
40,Very pleasant,"I spent a beautiful afternoon on this beach. I needed some alone time, came here, and spent 3 great hours listening to the sea and reading a book. As a Brit, I am used to overcrowded beaches. this was not the case.It was May, sunny and pleasantly warm.",Paul T

50,Afternoon spent at the beach— kid favorite!,Took out kids here while we were on vacation. They loved the pier and playing on the beach (pretty clean for the amount of people). Definitely a highlight from our trip.,lorielm
40,Great Place To Go Roller Blading,This is one of the most photographed beaches in the world and people rom all over come to visit. I recommend that you bring roller blades and skate down to Venice to see the freaks.,FlyersFanInLA
20,Ok But Intimidating,Great clean beach with tons of Restrooms.The only downside was the hoards of dope smokers and a lot of homeless people camped in tents with piles of garbage by them. We found it intimidating.I don't recommend you go with small children.,Mark G

You can find a spot for laying down your blanket, pitching an umbrella, and sunbathing. You can rent or bring your bike for a 4 mile ride. There are volleyball games to watch. Kids can make sandcastles. If you've never waded into the Pacific, you may be surprised by the chill and the strength of the waves, so don't leave your kids unattended. The water gleams. Surfers will be seen. On a clear high noon, you can see a glorious coastline going north to south.",Mary R

50,Stroll along the beach,"This beach is best accessed early in the evening to give you a perfect sunset experience. With the Pier so close by you can take the stairs up maybe try some traditional carny foods, have dinner at Bubba Gumps or at the many food vendors along the pier.Then go back to the beach, the walk on the sand will take soon time but it’s with it. Great place for a first date, engagement or just to get out and enjoy another one of California’s many gifts",Glenda D

50,Relaxing,"Can I just lay here and stay here all day?...visited in early December and the beach still head some warmth in peak sunlight hours with a light breeze. It was very pleasant, clean, and oh so tranquil. I loved the fixtures situated on the beach for children to play. I couldn’t help myself and enjoyed the swings for a while. So much space to walk, run, bike, workout, and play! This was my first time in Santa Monica, but after this visit, I made the decision that this will be where I stay every time I visit the LA area.",reViewsFromTheSis
20,7 day visit to Santa monica,"Fishing Santa Monica beach on a few occasions as we were there for 7 day.The beach did not inspire at all.The beach was dirty and garbage was everywhere.The homeless were everywhere around the beach area,I know should not blame them,but it looked tatty and uninviting.I have travelled around and been to some lovely beaches,but not this one.",marion25
50,Spectacular,"We’ve been to several beaches in California but Santa Monica just feels so California. The beach goes on forever...it’s just gorgeous. We were here at a time where the locals were complaining about it being cold & rainy but we still thought it was simply amazing. We just loved walking the beach every morning & being able to go to the peer, bars & restaurants with minimal crowds. In short- it’s the perfect “California” experience from the perspective of two seasoned travelers from the Midwest.",Wendy Z
40,Enjoy the summer breeze mussing up your hair!,"Santa Monica Beach, located just west of Downtown Los Angeles draws visitors from around the globe even as it continues to be extremely popular with the locals. The beach is 3.5 miles long and is noted for its soft sands and ideal weather.This 245-acre beach is managed by the City of Santa Monica in cooperation with California State Parks. Averaging about 340 days of sunshine a year, it was the backdrop for the iconic TV series “Baywatch”.As this is a long beach, perhaps the best way to see most of it is to follow the usual division - which is north of Santa Monica Pier and south of the pier (please also see my review of Santa Monica Pier)Santa Monica North Beach is separated from the city by the palisades and the Pacific Coast Highway. A series of stairs, walkways and bridges provide access from the city to the beach.The Annenberg Community Beach House is on North Beach. It offers magnificent views, a children’s play area and a beautiful pool – a public facility on the beach with no membership required, it makes the beach club experience accessible to all. Low or zero cost recreation / fitness programmes and cultural events are available here right through the year.Santa Monica South Beach on the south side of the pier is on the same level as the city with parks, homes and hotels overlooking the beach. The major attraction here is the original Muscle Beach – this is not like the Schwarzenegger-type weightlifting one on Venice Beach. This Muscle Beach features gymnastic and athletic equipment such as swings, ropes, balance bars, parallel bars, rings and more, open to children and adults free of charge.Beachfront biking is very popular - the Marvin Braude Bike Trail (better known as The Strand or the South Bay Bicycle Trail) is a hot favourite of avid cycling enthusiasts – all of 22 miles long, it starts from Will Rogers State Beach in Pacific Palisades and goes south to wind up at Torrance County Beach after passing though Venice, Hermosa and Redondo beaches!Apart from this, casual bicycling is perhaps the best way to explore this area at your own pace.Beach volleyball is very popular – there are many sand volleyball courts both south and north of the pier that are available daily on a first-come, first-served basis.Yet another attraction is surfing and paddle boarding - equipment rental and beginners’ lessons are available.Of course, the most common activity of all is just relaxing, playing or sunbathing on the beach sands!If you are staying at one of the beachfront hotels, walking or biking to the beach is easy since there are paved, lighted paths, clear direction signages, accessible walkways and bike lanes.Santa Monica Beach has picnic areas and parks that are popular with tourists and locals alike. Nearby hotels, restaurants on the pier and on Ocean Avenue offer a wide choice of cuisines at different price points.While Santa Monica Beach is at its most crowded during summer, it stays warm through the year and so does attract enough visitors through spring, fall and winter too. Fridays and Saturdays tend to see the largest beach crowds while mid-week has fewer visitors.Santa Monica Beach is great for all ages … its fun, family friendly, laid back, touristy, crowded … relax, walk barefoot on the sands, feel alive ... and enjoy the summer breeze mussing up your hair!",TMenon
30,Interesting beach,The views are beautiful - the iconic pier on one side and the beautiful coast on the other. Facilities are next to impossible to keep clean and trash is everywhere. Homeless people and transients are prevalent and begging is common. People peddling everything from glow necklaces to mangoes will solicit you every few minutes. Not a beach for really relaxing but if you want a place to take in views and the true LA flavor this is a good spot.,Jenny R
40,Easy way to spend a day!!,"As per the title,, its quite easy to spend a day strolling/riding along this wondrous stretch of beach..plenty of places to hire a pushy and be on your way,, we hired from a shop in town but there are plenty on the beach, navigating to the beach through Santa Monica was ok,, and we had a 8 and13yr old..so go with the flow..but in saying that we found that if you were to hire from the beach near the Pier, this would be beneficial as you would head to Venice Beach (third world to say the least), on the way taking in the skate park, basketball, muscle beach etc, .don't mind the endless homeless people, even the council drive around their humpies on the beach..I wouldn't recommend a night visit down that end of the beach unless you are really adventurous,,, anyway,,when you decide to return your bike you will be back close to the Pier to enjoy the night festivities..",Mark P
50,Day trip,Spent a certain time at the beach. Ideal for young children. The time I was there there was a section of the beach which had been allocated to veterans of wars. A beautiful touch and very evocative.,Angela B
50,Beautiful place near the pier,A must stop over near the pier. Street parking is 2$/hour along the road. Nice place for pictures. Bubba Gump at the pier is great for dinner or lunch.,No0osho
50,HUGE!,This beach is amazing - clean and wide - goes on forever. It was cool and windy when we were there so not a whole lot of activity on the beach. Imagine it's way different during nice weather.,LoveMyFamily6
20,Fithy and Overcrowded - Go further south or North..this is a waste,"Sad that the pier and beach is so filthy, it is NOT safe to swim, (Look at the beach reports before doing so) and it is so disgusting on the weekends, it is better to go to a pool",bc p
20,Family holiday ruined by general feeling of unsafe,"I’ve never written a review on here before but I felt complelled to write this morning. I’m sitting in my lovely hotel room with an amazing view of the beach, pier palm trees and mountains after paying a LOT of money and travelling a LONG way. Surely I should feel on top of the world. But I don’t because a woman just walked past shouting and swearing and hitting herself in the head. My husband just queued at starbucks with a guy wearing a tag with a nervous twitch that my daughter was scared of. And I know that shortly I will have to negotiate more vagrants and drugs to get my 4yr old and 1 yr old to the beach. The homeless problem in Santa Monica has consumed the town and in particular just outside of our Loews hotel and the pier. Basically the really touristy parts. It’s a real shame, this place could be so lovely but we don’t feel safe. I feel sorry for the people that don’t have a home, but it’s not what we paid £8k to see. Badly letdown",Sammy Mac
40,So Much To See And Do!,"Santa Monica State Beach is a terrific spot if you like action. Right next to Santa Monica Pier, there is stuff to do year-round. Volleyball courts, playgrounds, biking trails, etc, etc. You will not be bored!",misopiso88

20,Can be a lot better!,"This was a mixed bag. Has the potential to be a great place in the summer but it was pretty dirty, the pier was popular but lots of beggars and homeless walking around does put people off. Has all the hallmarks of a beach/pier town but just let down by its uncleanliness. Wouldn’t take time to visit here again.",2014msr

50,Awesome beach!!,Love to visit this beach when we come to the pier! Great place to sit and watch the waves and put your feet in the water! Great sunsets too!,Traycie B
50,Clean Beach,A nice respite from the noise and crowds on Santa Monica pier/3rd Street Promenade. Walked one way down on the beach and came back using the walkways. Wheeled transportation is separated by another walkway for walkers.,humudog
50,Beautiful Beach,Spend some time here and just take in the lovely view of the ocean and hills. A must do when in Santa Monica.,Rose21

40,On a sunny winters day,"We had a few hours left in LA so decided to head to the beach before heading to the airport. We parked up right near the main pier, which normally costs $10 to park; we ended up parking for free as we presented our Blue Badge. We had a nice walk along the beach, it was quite busy. The pier itself was very busy, quite commercial but lots to see. There was a food market on with lots of variety on offer; there was also entertainment from buskers and singers whilst walking round which added a bit of fun. We ate some funnel cake from the pier; it tasted good. All in, a very pleasant mooch to the beach, despite being quite commercial.",OriginalSoulGirl
40,Nice cool Beach!,"Well, It a nice beach and fun to visit I really like it there!! but it is so crowded every time over there! If you looking for peace and quiet this is not the place for you",powell
40,Lazy day fun!,Santa Monica beach is my favorite place to get away when I travel out to LA. The pier is always fun and full of things to do and I always follow that up with a nice stroll down the beach. It seems to be quieter here than down at Venice beach and the pier is always a beautiful backdrop to the amazing pacific coast.,Mary H
50,I spent everyday on this beach when I was there and I loved it.,This spot is on my bucket list when I go on vacation. I really enjoyed myself and I love the ocean. The beach is clean and the waves and the wind is very relaxing. I suggest anybody who likes the beach to go to Santa Monica.,568jeanniem
50,Nice!,Super nice. Very clean beach. Very big and spacious. Perfect for long walks and chats. Highly recommending,paulinaz0794
40,December visit,We enjoyed walking around on this beach. It wasn’t too busy while we were there. It’s amazing how much trash is on this beach since there is trash cans and recycling cans like every 50 feet on this beach.,Chad
40,Its Santa Monica,"Walked here from Venice beach and really enjoy it. Beach was spotless and quiet giving it a real romance and couples feel. At night as the sun came down the beach had some interesting bird life but best of all was sitting with strangers what the sun hit the sea.Personal thought. Do Venice first (Santa Monica feels safer for night-time) but eat in Venice. There are more cheap outlets.However, just off the beach in Santa Monica are an array of restaurants.",AdeWotton
20,"Nice, but too much trash in the sand","Santa Monica State Beach is just a walk out of most hotel’s doors in SM, which is delightful. There really is quite a bit to do here with Muscle Beach, walking, biking, scooter path and the Pier. There are lifeguards diligently working up and down the beach to keep everyone safe and they were plentiful and really doing their jobs!Trash cans are lined up and that helps to keep the picnic trash and drink containers off the beach and things clean. Unfortunately, the sand is just inundated with small pieces of trash and plastic, it’s part of the sand. You name it, it’s small and either ground up in there or just sitting there. It’s too bad. Not the fault of this beach or their practices, just a sign of how very dirty and polluted our waters are. So, digging in the sand has its challenges and so does sinking your toes into nice, fluffy sand. If you know the trash is going to bother you, look elsewhere.",kdavi3
50,Awesome chilled out day,"Great way to soak up some rays, kick back with an ice cream or a cold beverage or maybe both. Smell the fresh sea air and enjoy the wind in your hair.",Kiwi5
20,Golden State Beach No More,My wife and I recently stopped by for a quick re-visit. We lived in the LA area(Calabasas) in the 1980's and early 90's. Even then whenever we took the kids to this beach and most others nearby they got sick. Never go in the water after a rain. On this visit since it was November and quite chilly and early in the morning on a Sunday the beach and water folks were not there. We now live in the desert of Arizona and do not miss this beach or the crowd that goes there at all. Glad to be out.,Richard S
40,Nice beach,"A very nicely maintained and extensive beach, spoiled by the smell of urine from the gardens you need to pass on the way to the sand. We noticed this especially near the entrance to the pier. This smell comes, presumably, from the many homeless folk living in whatever shelter they can find.There is beachside parking , for a fee and the beach is easily accessible for disabled visitors.",Richard T

50,Amazing trip,"It’s amazing trip to Santa Monica boulevard and beach , how people do their talent in third street and restaurants and coffee shops every where , more activities in third street so after that move to Santa Monica beach so quite and you can go to pacific park also will find people they do their talent",Sultan Aljehani

50,Beautiful beach.,Just love this beach. It is so clean and never overcrowded. Love to walk from Venice along the shore to the pier. It takes about an hour. Great to watch the crashing waves and watch the surfers.,karenfanti
50,Beautiful beach!!!,"The Santa Monica beach is one of the nicest and most relaxing in the area! We were just here visiting in November so while the beach itself was fairly empty, the weather was great! The water was cold but nice and calm. Highly recommend making a good beach day here!",CostasDaGreek
40,Huge Beach,Absolutely a huge beach. Volleyball courts everywhere and I love all the play grounds and fitness grounds. No wonder people are so active here. They build it all so you just want to be outside.Public washrooms are a great plus too.Only down side; a tonne of homeless. It can be overwhelming.,Darrell H

40,Wide White and hot,"This beach is accessable from Santa Monica Pier and at this point there is a shower to clean off your feet if you wish. There are lifeguard huts (just like on the tele!). The sand is clean although the days vivistors had left some of their trash unfortunately. We were there in the afternoon and had to skilfully avoid stepping on a used nappy (diaper) - uck, but I suppose that there will always be people that do this. You could however tell that the beach is maintained to a good standard.The water was tepid but clean as far as we could see.I like to beach comb but nothing along the waters edge on this beach.Nevertheless a lovely place to chill in the hot sun.",toddlerpants

50,Beautiful,"We didn't think we could beat South beach in Miami but this was certainly on a par with that!Stunningly clean beach with lovely views of Santa Monica pier. We visited from the UK in October and the weather was great. It felt so safe as always emergency services patrolling the beach and it was immaculately clean.On my down side is the sea is FREEZING cold! I'd have thought that 10 months into the year it would have warmed up! Ah well, not an issue. Was great watching the huge waves crashing onto the shore.A great beach and good for sunbathing.",Simon T
50,Clean and Peaceful,"Blown away by the calm day I had at the santa monica beach. The sand is perfect, but gets hot on a sunny day, so be careful. The water's cold, but so beautiful to look at. The beach is well maintained and cleaned often. What a gem.",katherinejade07
40,A California experience!,The State Beach is a fun place to people watch. The beach is located very near a parking lot and is easy to access for the handicapped.,Diane V
30,Great Beach,"Whether for walking, surfing, people watching, this beach is wonderful. The walkway just behind the beach is great for biking or walking. Sadly, the public bathrooms are pretty much disgusting, and hundreds of homeless people sleep anywhere along the beach and adjoining walking areas. That's why a fantastic beach only gets three stars from me....",chopstickmama
50,Beautiful!,"Don’t miss! Beautiful, clean and well attended by lifeguards. Plenty of facilities-toilets, showers, water fountains all the way along. Parking not cheap but easiest and cheapest found was a huge surface car park right on the beach-Lot 4 South.",Jemma G
50,Clean and Safe,This area of LA is safe to walk. The beach area has public services and trails that are maintained. Pay to park but space was available every day. The beach is vast and clean. Life guards are on duty.,Sven A

30,Groomed and spacious,"The beach is expansive and solicited by lots of people of course. There is a lot of gym equipment which intrigued me. The people working out were quite young, we were there in the morning so I was wondering if they were shift workers or wealthy, tourists or something else? Visually it is an stunning place.",Reuben M
50,Great beach!,Enjoyed a day at the beach with my daughter! We had a great time walking the beach. The view of Santa Monica is really cool! The beach is clean and well cared for!I also looked at the rooms the State Park offers they look pretty nice. Would be interested in staying in the future!,Matt Roelandts
50,Nice,"It is nice to walk down Santa Monica beach - there’s the Santa Monica pier, pacific park, muscle beach and it is nice to see people playing volleyball or exercising at the muscle beach area.

50,"Great beach, clean, lots of great restaurants nearby","The beach is nice, very long walk to the water, lots of sand, nice bike path, cool stuff like volleyball and slackline. Just don't hand out after dark unless you are a very big group. There are quite a lot of homeless so you need to be carful.",momlikesthebest
50,Just like Baywatch! So America...,"Beautiful yellow sand for miles, blue cloudless sky, beach volleyball courts free to use everywhere, lots of clean free toilets every few hundred metres, the famous pier, life guard huts.... you can walk / cycle for miles... just love love love it! Great vibe, lots of coffee shops to grab a drink or ice cream, places to hire bikes.... love love love it! So Baywatch (yes, the TV show nostalgia) and so America",Angela G
40,Fun place on the beach,Was great to see all the new stuff on the pier. Very active place and an easy walk to or from the beach. Plenty of food options. Good for all ages to. But it isn't cheap if you want to eat and do some of the entertainment.,Tucson M
40,"Massive wide sand, awesome waves!",Enjoyed an afternoon jumping the waves with the kids. Water not too cold once you get in! Some hefty waves so watch the small ones. No seaweed which was nice. Huge expanse of sand so everyone has a space. Lot of pigeons and seagulls though.,EssJayWhy
30,Very touristy,Found the beach and surroundings very beautiful but extremely over taken with tourists and vendors..,Christopher S
50,Serene Beach Location,"I enjoyed my time spent at this beach, north of the Santa Monica Pier. We were there during the week. It was super quiet, the water was clean and clear, and their were plenty of lifeguards on duty. The beach was super clean as well. There were also restrooms and food options within walking distance. A fantastic beach to visit .",Jon A
50,Nice beach,"A huge beach with very fine sand. Space is not an issue. The waves are a great height and the sea temperature was about perfect in August. Not a lot of shops around apart from on the pier so bring a drink and snack. Enjoy, we did.",Dave B
50,Beautiful clean beach. Lots going on,Had view of the beach from our hotel Loews. So much going off plenty to watch! Very clean and beautiful beach,wendyw0061
50,To see,This place marks the arrival of route 66 with relative sign. At the end it appears to be a small pier with several nice shops. Surely it is a point that you can not miss to visit if you go from those parts.,SimoneErcoli
50,Enjoy a nice swim and holiday feel while in LA,"Great spot to continue your holiday while in LA, yes few miles away from busy LA you can relax on a white clean sand, no plastics in the water. Beach is huge so you want feel it crowded. Water is clean and small waves are there to have fun. Some are surfing. You can park just right on the beach. Restaurants are not far if you need to eat, but better take with you water. Shower and toilets are provided as well as health and exercise facilities. You can rent bikes too. Enjoy the experience!",NabilBKK
50,Awsome,An wonderful place to enjoy especially late afternoon looking for an amazing sunsetBody board is a great activity to enjoy with family and friendsGreat ambiance maybe a little nostalgia from the beach boysSURFIN USA,Pierre C
50,Beach life!,What a great beach - clean and well kept with lifeguards every 50m or so. Only downside is that it’s a walk to get drinks 🙄🙄😂,Mark G
50,Awesome Beach!!!,"My family and I went to Santa Monica Beach while visiting in LA. I have never, ever seen a beach with so much to do. We first dine at a very nice seafood restaurant on the pier and following dinner we strolled on the beachfront up to Venice beach while enjoying the sunset, the people and the sights. We rode on the electric scooters and also took a bike taxi back from Venice beach.",neluv05
50,Summer on the beach,Nice town great places to eat. We stopped at one beach was small and crowed later drove further and found the better beach. Explore before you set up for the day...,Tammy-NOLA
50,Wonderful,one of the best places I ever visited . a lot of shops and restaurantsYou also will see many activity there done by local people . most of them funny,Mike_ishaq
30,Immersion in the Ocean,"Impressively large beaches both in terms of stretch as it starts from Venice beach and end after Malibu, but also depthWe were there with the families and small age children and enjoyed a long swim mostly playing with uninterrupted flow of waves that rose often to make the swim quiet challenging for the kids.",Alexandre K
40,Great beach for the family,We went for the sunset. Parking lot was connected to the beach directly and there were numbers of attractions for kids.,Nicole L
50,Sea,Great for jumping the waves and we managed to find a spot on the beach without a problem . You can rent an umbrella if you want as it’s hot .,JGFIELD
40,Great beach - especially at sundown - best sunset we saw during our holiday,We visited Venice Beach in the afternoon and had a wonderful swim there - crashing waves and warm sea. Then we rented Metro bicycles from Venice Beach and cycled to Santa Monica State Beach. The only problem here is that there isn't a bicycle return point at Santa Monica Beach so you have to cycle another 20 minutes uptown to return the bikes. When we got to the nearest bike park at the train station it was full of bicycles so we had to cycle another 20 minutes to get to the next bike park! Not the fault of Santa Monica State Beach but worth noting if you are planning to visit here. The beach itself is beautiful. The pier is full of amusements which are quite expensive - but go at the end of the day to capture fabulous sunset photographs!,Karen M
50,Waves!,We are from the westcoast of Canada but thought we should check out Santa Monica. Get a boogie board-my kids and I couldnt get enough of the waves!,samtammy1212
40,"Fun, but you don’t swim there","A good beach to play, walk, hang around with friends. If you want to swim, go down a little more: there the water is filthy with sewers exhaust, especially after a storm.",Chiara C.
40,There is always somewhere to catch some rays,"This is a fun beach with lots of waves and happenings going on all the time. It’s safe to swim (life guards are on duty), get some food and drink, and enjoy the sand. There are nice resturant or cheep eats so there really is something for everyone. RECOMMEND bringing a towel as the sand can get very warm when the sun is out. Have fun!!!",DanFortune
50,Beautiful Beach,"It is one of the lovely spots in LA, the beach is clean and the weather was good last week so we had the opportunity to swim as well.Good Facilities in terms of Showers & Changing rooms.",M_Araby7
40,Nicer than Venice beach,"Nice deep beach with plenty of space for all. When we visited there were sting rays in the water and some people were stung. The lifeguards are very competent and helpful.There are people who walk around and sell marijuana, ice cream, water and fruit. The fruit was very good.There aren’t too many places to eat along the boardwalk but just one street up, there are plenty of restaurants.It’s MUCH nicer than Venice beach.",Kris91
50,Great fun,Really nice Beach went in shorts and tank top water was really cold in July took a picture and in the sand wrote Cali hardly any seashells but nice and beautiful sunsets would definitely go back,Love2Travel100
50,Love this beach soooo much!,Everything I expected and more. Very picturesque and typical American beach with palm trees etc. The boardwalk was busy with cyclists and scooters and there was a muscle beach area where we watched some people do cool tricks on the trapeze! After a visit to the pier we settled near the beachfront right by the oceans edge. We bought a body board from one of the guys wandering around for $20 which was great for he sheer convenience of it all. We stayed there for 4 hours and barely came out of the sea! We had such a great time and loved it so much that we moved our car to another space in order to be able to stay there another 4 hours!,Nelzgirl
40,Nice beach,"Very busy in parts but plenty of room if you walk away from the main crowds. Not a beach for poor swimmers as there is a lot of drag when the tide is going out but plenty of waves.If you want something else to do, you can walk along the pier where there is loads going on.",AnnieM452
10,Ballardesque dystopian dump,"The beach, broad-walk and pier in Santa Monica were like a scene out of a Ballard novel (a combination of High Rise and Super-Cannes). Unless you are into some of the worst elements of what the American culture can produce then avoid Santa Monica and Venice Beach at all costs.Dangerous at night, grotty in the day. It is clear why most American’s chose Miami Beach.",Jason B

40,Good to see,It was good to be there - especially at sunset - the West Coast and all of its meaning and the start of a journey up the Pacific Coast Highway. Good times.,Harrison F. Carter
50,Our favorite beach in LA,Close to everything. We live this beach. Clean with great lifeguard services. Highly recommend. Ample reasonable parking for everyone.,FirstClass001
40,Beautiful beach,"The beach was beautiful with lifeguards on duty. Where we were, it wasn’t crowded and we walked right up and put our stuff about 100 feet from the water. From what we saw, the beach also appeared clear of trash. There is a nice walking/bike path along the beach that’s well kept.Only downside was that the bathroom was a relatively far walk.",Tim K
40,Likes everywhere,I do love this beach!! I think the lime scooters are taking over though haha that being said it has great views from above the beach and on it. Water is warm this year in my opinion! Lots of places to walk or Uber to for a good bite after a long beach day,Never a number
50,Wow!,"This truly is a Californian beach (as seem an TV - sorry to be cheesy)! We strolled a couple of miles in length, paddling in the waves and watched surfers. I wish we'd spent longer here. In the evening we watched the sun set- perfect! <3",Rach
50,Spot the lifeguards,Just like it is on TV. Great clean expanse of beach with ocean lapping the shore! Even a resident lifeguard jogging shirtless along the shoreline 😻,Hazel B
40,Great place to picnic and watch a sunset!,Nice beach. Crowded on one side of pier more than the other. Beautiful sunset. Lifeguard on duty. No bathrooms unless you go up to the pier.,cw0108
20,Very dirty beaches go to Malibu,Dirty beaches. Go to Malibu Zuma beach where you won’t find hoarded of people and plastic on the beach. Also over crowded with homeless people and people doing drugs.,AZTPP2013
40,Gorgeous beach,"The expanse of the beach was just so relaxing as you didn’t need to be near anyone. Just wonderful to sit and watch the sea, enjoying some sun and lots of quiet.",Syzygy2011
50,Awesome beach! Great swimming.,"Our whole family loved hanging out here. Quite a few people even during the week, but the beach is huge so there was plenty of room to play still.We bought boogie boards from a beach vendor and our kids loved riding the waves. Sand is smooth and you can go out quite a ways. Lifeguards on duty which is nice.",emilypapaya
50,Great day out,We loved this beautiful beach. Can walk it forever. Clean. Lovely sand. Could have stayed longer. Not a fan of the pier though...too touristy.,Linda H
40,Nice BIG beach,"You can find all kinds enjoying the vast beach in the heart of LA. Lots of room for sports, relaxing, chasing children around or surfing and swimming. The drawback is parking and a long walk to the water.",naneliz
30,Another day at the beach,"The Beach is average. The homeless and litter didn’t help. It was a less crowded beach to the north of the boardwalk. Lots of people. Vendors/individuals selling umbrellas, fruit and other miscellaneous items. Boardwalk was fun for the kids. The water wasn’t as clean as other areas. There was quite a drop off from the shore. It was enough for half the day.",Nancy B
40,Very Wide Beach!,"We spent a wonderful day at the beach in Santa Monica. Compared to the beaches we have been to on the east coast, Santa Monica is extremely wide, lots of space for everyone! One thing we noticed is the amount of seaweed in the water, I’ve never seen anything like it.There are public restrooms/changing rooms on the pier. Parking is available near the pier and also in garages further up the hill in town.",Eric W
40,Great beach.,Parking around here is expensive but this doesn't put people off as the car parks get full early. The sea depth is very gentle so it's good for kids.Only thing I dispared of was people leaving rubbish on the beach when to be fair there were lots of bins on the beach itself which people had to walk past to be off the beach! It seems it's not in some people's psyche to follow simple protocols.,Andrew B
50,Clean inviting beach,This beach reminded me of many of the Australian beaches having wide expanses of clean sand and waves unlike most in Great Britain The whole area is very well maintained including the area near the pier which attracts large numbers of people.,Betula103
50,Just lovely,"The MOST stunning sunset....... Beautiful beach mostly very clean and well lifeguarded. This place takes my breath away, plenty of facilities, great beach walk, cycle, skate way.",Laura W
40,What more could you want?,You don’t get many beaches like this in England. It’s expansive and sandy. Decent waves for learning to surf. Get there early otherwise it gets busy. Lots of options for food and drink nearby and public loos too. Very trendy and full of life at night. Really enjoyable for me and my family.,Tracy M
50,Wow!,"What a great beach! Lovely sand, miles of it, great surf, beautiful people, handy for town, places to eat, it’s got the lot.",AJD37
50,Beautiful one day Visit,We reached around 10 in the morning. The beach is clean and very well maintained. The walks towards the Pier is really awesome. They have the famous Bubba Grimp Shrimp Co. for yum food & lots of street artist on the way. We also spotted a seal on the edge of the pier. Really enjoyed the entire day with some beer & sun bathing,Rakesh NG
40,A nice stretch of sand,"A huge, white sand beach with lots to see and do. There are bike paths and facilities. Lifeguards appear to be on duty and actively involved.",Buddy V
40,Enjoyable time at the beach,"My wife and 18 yr old daughter and I arrived at the beach at 2 on a Thursday through the pedestrian bridge just north of the Santa Monica pier. We were staying at a nearby hotel. The area near the beach parking lot was crowded with people but a short 5 minute walk allowed for plenty of space to put down some towels and sunbathe for a couple hours. The beach was clean near us and not crowded. The water is chilly but refreshing after getting hot in the sun. There is also a nice breeze. I would not classify this beach as a great swimming beach due to the churned up seaweed floating in an area from 40-70 feet from the waters edge and cool temps, but its great for wading in and if you are just looking for some sun bathing time its perfect. Bathrooms/changing rooms are located about every 1/4 mile along the beach which is convenient. There is also free wi-if although the reception was hit or miss at times.",Doug R

50,Immaculate stretch of white sand beach,Walked on the beach from hotel towards the pier late afternoon with beautiful sunlight and palm trees. Can imagine it must be very nice in the day to enjoy good weather,DidierNivelles
20,Traffic is horrendous!! And parking expensive!,First time we went we actually turned round and went back as it was horrendousWe then went back a couple of days later after lunch - traffic just as bad and parking costs absolutely horrendous which then made it hard to relax on the beach thinking about the time you’ve been there and the cost of it!The beach itself is ok - very busy and a lot cooler with the breeze. The sea current is very strong so be carefulIs it worth the traffic hassle and cost of parking ?? In my opinion - No!,BrionyParrott
20,Big let down after what you hear and see on TV etc,"This was one of our first top 5 places to see in LA on our USA family holiday... not one of us liked it or have spoken of it after our 4.5 week holiday... it was simply disappointing. The sand is dirty, the amenities were putrid, and access was (admittedly a Saturday) very strenuous to park nearby. The walkways and immediate adjacent facilities simply need some tender loving... simple maintenance. The water for Summer was too cold to swim. Not even the locals were entering the water to a large degree. If you don’t have a lot of time in LA, give Santa Monica Beach the miss.",Shane M
50,Relaxing,Beautiful views! Great time on this side of the pier. It is very clean & worth the trip. I will definitely go back.,Lisa V
30,Go for the beautiful scenery and people watching,"Go for the beautiful scenery and people watching; touristy and we did not want to get in the water.

30,Huge waves,"There were so many children out in the ocean without life jackets. I think that is dangerous here. The waves were fierce. I can understand why my grandmother never got in water after leaving the west coast. AND, there were no seashells to be found...",meganlucas09

20,Family holiday,We didn’t swim in the beach we looked at it and people watched but honestly the beach wasn’t inviting at all. But we are spoilt here in Australia with beautiful beaches. Still worth visiting,Jaime

50,Stunning,Soft sand and a boardwalk as well as little showers and direct access from the pier. There were plenty of visitors on the beach for the Pacific Ocean rollers. There was tons of atmosphere with a couple of beach sellers offering a range of things. The beach is obviously well respected and maintained. An hour or so on it was a thoroughly enjoyable experience. I would love to return.,lottie03

50,Nice view of California living,"I visited this around noon and it was a beautiful place to be in. There were rides for kids, an arcade for teens, a long stretch of beach for everybody else to do pretty much anything. There were volleyball nets set up and I even saw a space for flag football and frisbee. There were restaurants in the harbor too. It was a cool experience for me.",Loremel H
40,Good beach to visit,I liked the SM Beach...good overall visit. Venice Beach has an element of interesting craziness that’s dissipated by the time you get to SM.Now what is needed are probably more beech like spots to eat and drink versus heading back to your hotel. Big Deans is by the pier but we should see more spots like that along the way and with interesting beach shops as well.,Yves S

20,"Crowded, could be cleaner","We visited on a weekend so we did expect a crowd but this beach is not well-maintained. We have experienced better beach spots in Southern CA. Lots of debris & bits of trash in the sand. Very limited washroom facilities & found only one spot to rinse off sand with a very long line. With more care & attention, this could be a beautiful beach. Families seemed to enjoy the proximity to the attractions on the pier.",ljh114

50,Nice visit,"It's a lovely place to walk around for the day. Just looking at the houses by the beach, seeing what the boardwalk has to offer, and letting the kids play in the sand - it was a nice afternoon!",jmasc1
30,Busy beach,It was a heatwave and a weekend so we expected it to be busy. The water was very cool and pretty refreshing but a bit of a mess. The tide was coming in and the surf lifesavers require a huge no go zone to get rescue vehicles in so beach space was limited. Can see why the world loves Aussie beaches. There were about 100 people queuing to use the outdoor showers. The water doesn’t seem as salty as at home so we were fine to dry off a bit and hop straight back on our bikes.,Culinarykids

40,Am trip to the beach,"We stayed four blocks up Colorado, minutes away, the beach is huge! So much sand!

30,Beautiful but too crowded,"Its a nice standard beach with lots of people and volley ball courts and lifeguards, however its always very crowded and parking is a nightmare.

40,"Clean and huge, but water a bit cold in mid-june for my taste.","The Santa Monica State beach was well policed with both law enforcement and lifeguards. Water was surprisingly cold for mid june, but that is our first experience.Given the size of the beach, and the cold water, no wonder beach volleyball was invented. I am sure it feels good to go in the ocean after sweating on the beach playing games or sunbathing. Seemed cleaner than farther down south towards the marina.",Gerard P

40,"Big, wide open...amazing views!","Large beach and very pretty from a distance. When you are ON the beach, it is dirty-ish and not necessarily a safe barefoot place. When we were there, one in our group stepped in something dark- we're assuming oil (maybe tar??) in the sand and it took 2 showers worth of scrubbing to get it to go away. There was broken glass in the sand and some trash randomly strewn about. I would guess it gets very crowded during peak times, so I imagine that the beach is cleaned as well as it can be on a regular basis.",dherbst75

30,Expected more,"After seeing Hollywood with the dirty ness of its streets I was happy to see Santa Monica take a little more pride in keeping the streets clean. However it’s overwhelming how many homeless & crazy people linguine around. I don’t want to sound nasty as it very sad and the Gov needs to do more. We explored the pier & there beach was huge, sad part of that we witnessed a girl get robbed by a homeless man,On a positive note lovely bars & restaurants.",CRaeCRae

There are lots of folks around doing many different activities, and although there are some homeless early sleeping, no one bothered me at all. I just thought how great it would be to live by a place with an ocean view on your morning exercise. There's also fun bikes and scooters to use, just download the app and you pay by the minute and the app unlocks them for you to use.",thereKarengoes

50,Spectacular beach walks and views.,"This is fun place to walk around. First off, the beach is super wide and soft on your feet. If you want to walk on a hard surface there is that too. All the way from Santa Monica Pier to the Ventura residential areas further south. There are lovely restaurants along the walkway as well as bike rental shops and the sweaty descendants of the muscle culture of the early twentieth century. You can see the aficionado's working out on their favorite gym equipment (some in their seventies); don't gawk! Most of the time there is a lovely soft breeze to cool you down as you walk along and soak in the views. Visible from the beach as well are the mountains north of LA.",MaldivesAfficionado

50,Chili March waters but beautifil,This beach is definitely one of the largest beaches we have been on and is very clean. We were very impressed and our kids want to return another day. Lots of people but it was such a big area it didn’t seem crowded. It is hard to get close to the water unless you can easily navigate the sand so if you have any disabilities it’s something to keep in mind.,Haparker01

40,Cleaning up their act!,"I had written a review of this beach in 2016 after having been disgusted with the large amounts of trash everywhere. I re visited this beach and wow what a difference! They have obviously worked hard at cleaning up this beautiful place. There was still trash, but much cleaner by ten fold. I was super happy to see this. Hopefully they can get the tourists to take better care of this area in the future. I still saw many people leaving garbage and plastic right on the beach. Disheartening, but on the right track!",Julie B

40,First tour to beach,This is my first tour to beach.i and my wife spent really a good amount of time in the water and the sunset view was amazing......,sjnv
40,"Great beach, lots of room in March","On the advice of a friend who is a local we came to Santa Monica Beach by the pier. We paid for parking which for us is ok tourists from Wisconsin. Beware of vendors up and down the beach trying to sell items you can buy at the pier stores. Also like everywhere else you go everyone wanting a buck. Just say no to everyone and walk away! There are plenty of security and law enforcement if there are any issues. LA has a huge homeless problem that is apparent everywhere you go, I don't add to it, so walk on by and keep yourselves safe. The beach itself is vast with lots of room for everyone. The surf is beautiful with the large waves crashing down coming up to the shore. The water temperature was cold so not many in the water but there some. I did not see anyone surfing. Not much for seashells though. People were fishing from the pier but I did not see them catching anything. There are bathrooms and changing rooms up on the pier along with lockers you can rent. speaking of rentals I did see bicycles for rent. I did not see any other watercraft or activities other than tours. Plenty of different vendors to get food as well but many bring snacks and or a picnic lunch. The pier has a bunch of rides for kids of all ages. Check the height requirements for the rides before buying wristbands. The Unlimited wristbands are worth it if your child is going to go on 3 or 4 rides at least. The big issue is young riders needing an adult or older rider with them. That can then cost you an additional wristband. So see if it is in your budget or worth the cost for you. For history buffs,Santa Monica Pier is also the end of historic Route 66 which starts in Chicago.Lastly, there are other more family friendly beaches out there but they are boring as well. So if you want to see a west coast landmark while going to the ocean and beach this is it and it is pretty family friendly with plenty of security.",Budes65
50,Def walk from Santa Monica to Venice beach,It’s a very chill walk from Santa Monica to Venice beach and it took us around 4 hours. Go on a sunny day and you won’t regret it !,Lin G
30,Not and Aussie beach but good to visit,The beach can be crowded in summer so be prepared. The wind chill can be quite bitter when we were there in May and the smell was a bit on the nose. Walk along one way and you have a vast beach. Walk the other way and you come to 'muscle beach' where the body builders work out and there are some volley ball courts.Worth a look but don't sacrifice too much for it.,Kerrivv
50,"Beautiful beach, well maintained","Was amazed each day when I went out for a jog on the path that runs along the state beach how well maintained this area was. There are plenty of facilities, garbage cans, and maintenance people keeping it in shape. There is some level of homeless, but no panhandling or other issues. The beach is groomed daily.",dsj5777

If you go near the Santa Monica Pier, there is limited parking, but you can find lots around the area. City maintains the beaches very nicely and are very clean and well staffed with lifeguards along the beach. There are a few places to eat along the beach. Also there are places to rent bikes, roller blades and other beach related items. If you want to enjoy a day at the beach, this is a good one to go too.",mcorbin560

20,Meh!,"Look, i spose i expected more from such an iconic beach.The beach itself, the sand and surf was beautiful. We rented bikes and rode along the beach to Venice Pier which was nice.But whoever said that L.A. had a homeless problem was tricking. Soooo many homeless people live on the Santa Monica beach.

Swimming may be ok, too, I don't know. Ambient temperature is mild in January, but the water is very cold!

The beautiful park overlooking the beach is just row after row of passed out drunks and addicts. The promenade and tourist areas smell like vomit and urine.

20,So gross,"Stayed at a hotel near the beach and went for a walk each morning. So much ocean/beach trash!!! Despite having recycling and trash cans on the flippin beach, which totally ruins the views, the beach still has trash everywhere. There are also a fair amount of homeless people who call this beach and the surrounding parks home. So what does this mean for you? Get set for people yelling things at you, asking you for money, and possibly following you. Sound like a great way to make friends? Visit santa monica beach!!!",ihateusairways

40,"An Iconic, Lovely Beach That Suffers from Severe Overcrowding","The Santa Monica Beach is one of the most iconic in the US, thanks to the Santa Monica Pier and its world-famous Pacific Park seaside amusement park. It's a lovely beach: large and spacious with great views up and down the coast and buildings that don't rise above several stories high (thanks to the oppressive California Coastal Commission). The breeze from the Santa Ana Winds always feels good and there are plenty of lifeguards on duty with a regular police presence, so safety isn't an issue. The beach is pretty clean from what I've seen on the days I've visited, there are free outdoor showers for washing off salt/sand (but no bathhouses that I've seen), and there's plenty of places to eat/use the restrooms at the Santa Monica Pier. It's a great place to kill an afternoon!My biggest gripe, however, is how busy the Santa Monica Beach can get. Seeing as how it IS such an iconic beach, you will find it far more busy and crowded than other beaches, including neighboring beaches located just down the coast a little way. On a typical day, it's busy but not overly packed, but if you go on a peak day, you can find yourself having to pack in uncomfortably close to other beach-goers...or giving up because there's just no place to stake out for your group for the day. Keep that in mind if you're thinking about going on a Saturday in July! You may find yourself having better luck at Venice, Leo Carrillo, El Matador, Malibu or Manhattan Beaches (as just a few examples) instead. In addition, parking can be difficult to find on busier days too. There are city run beach/pier parking lots, but they fill up quickly. In the 4 times I've been there, I've never used the city lots for parking; I've always had to park in one of the seaside hotel underground parking garages (for $20+) because the city lots were full and traffic was at absolute gridlock.If you've never been there, you need to go. I chuckle each time I visit, because Santa Monica Beach is the beach that was modeled for the video game ""Grand Theft Auto V,"" and everything--including the Santa Monica Pier, surrounding buildings and even the lifeguard shacks--is modeled down to the most minute detail that you can see in real life when you visit the Santa Monica Beach. (If only I could land a 747 on the beach in real life like I have in the game!) :)Must see and highly recommended!",Jake G
40,It's Nice,"It was clean considering the overall LA standardWe had lunch at an Italian little pub, we walked and it was nice, it is part of LA Staple to visit Santa Monica, it was cold for us since we live in Miami and it was way colder throughout the whole trip",PattyG76

The Santa Monica pier has many things for the whole family to do. At the north end of the beach is the Annenberg pool and they have really nice facilities. Definitely do not miss the Marion Davies house as it is a historic landmark at the north end of Santa Monica Beach.There is a lot of history in this building. Marion Davies was the girlfriend of William Randolph Hearst.,Richard L

For a start, in true US style its huge, too big for some I know. But I liked that. You can be in a big crowd right beside the water or sit alone in 100 square meters of sand and pretend to be lost in the desert. There is so much to do; people watch, play volleyball, swim, bike, relax or gaze at that fabulous pier. They have live concerts some nights too. I loved it. In fact I enjoy Santa Monica all up. Lots of activity, great weather (I did go in summer) and friendly people. Not for those seeking a wilderness experience but great for sun and fun. Super close to hotels and restaurants too. A 5 star place for me.",Kgnof1977

This time, we visited in the morning with relatively fewer people. I found that, compared with 20+ years ago, this beach was so clean! The tidal waves washed the sand beach and made it glitter under the sun. I was fascinated by this view.Also, parking in the pier parking lot was easy and cheap.The only downside is that the view is not as picturesque as some beaches in California central coast, due to lack of surrounding mountain.",VIPofHotels

50,Watching the sunset on a beach never gets old,Although it was a cool December evening we still took off our shoes and walked in the beach. Visiting from Canada it wasn’t that bad and I’m sure we looked the classic tourist. Beach was very clean and met some great people including a couple that had just got engaged....literally she was still crying.... next time we will make some more time to explore further down but we had a good walk around and saw some of the local sites. Definitely more homeless people up in the park north of the pier but didn’t seem to be an issue on the beach it self.,Ken B
40,I enjoy coming to this beach,"I've never had a bad experience coming to the beach at Santa Monica. I like the walk to Venice Beach, I enjoy watching the classes for surfers, and the abundance of places to eat and shop at the Promenade. I've never had a big problem parking and so overall think it is a good place for new visitors to CA. Parking meters give you up to 5 hours, so no worries there.",desertmidwife

We watched them going through the bins, so sad.Don't just move these poor people on, give them permanent shelter, such wealth and poverty together is heartbreaking.",Relativestranger
50,Breathtaking,This is a beautiful beach with breathtaking views! I would definitely recommend relaxing here when headed to Santa Monica. The beach is huge so there is plenty of room to relax and enjoy the waves.,Superfresh85
40,OK but definitely lots of homeless that make you feel unsafe.,"We spent 2 weeks in Santa Monica from Christmas through the 1st week of January. It is nice but as the other reviewer stated, there is LOTS of homeless. Even while eating on a patio of a nice restaurant with the kids a person came up and asked if I would buy him a piece of pizza. It wouldn’t be that bad but a lot of these people look strung out on drugs. The kids wanted to move more inside so we did. The City is beautiful and we did the BIRD scooters which was fun and we went on the outer limits of the city with them which was very nice and could eat outside with no problem. We did a lot, the boardwalk, Santa Monica Stairs, Venice Beach (even more homeless there), and traveled the LA area and parks. It was nice. We saw it but probably won’t go back.",markclarkw
50,Amazingly well kept,"The beach was cleaned and groomed every day, even when it rained!! which it doesn't very often in CA. No dogs are allowed on the beach but there's plenty of path ways to walk them near to the ocean. You do have a lot of homeless in the area but they tend to leave you alone if you leave them alone,you have washroom facilities at regular spacing along the ocean front and lots of choices of cafes and restaurants where you can sit and just take in the view.",karenjwilson27

Walkers, runners, skaters, bikers all on at the same time, but nit that crowded. Sun will be shinning 330 days a year...",Judpma012
50,Run or cycle santa monica,I visited family in Santa Monica. Their house was just off the Ocean Park Boulevard and only a few blocks from the beach. Once you reach the beach turn right (west). If you go left you will be in Venice - a rough area. The beach is well maintained. The sand is raked everyday and the litter is collected. There are toilets about every half mile. There are drinking fountains and showers as you come off the beach. There are also swings for the children and volley ball nets.There is a paved running/cycle path that is well marked and is parallel to the beach. The cycle path ends at about at 5- miles and the running/walking path ends at about 6-miles. There is a staircase on your right just after running past the Santa Monica Pier. The staircase leads to the Palisades Park - you can run about three miles west with scenic views of the beach from the cliffs - well worth it!,Roderick L
30,Average beach - go at low tide to see sea creatures under pier.,"I've been here many times. It is a nice beach, but gets way too crowded in the Summer.

Try to head to the pier at some stsge as it has lots of performance artists and loads of vendors hawking popcorn, ice cream, hot dogs etc.We loved walking on the beach in the evening as the sun began to set. The crowds had largely dissipated by that stage so there was a lot more room, yet enough folks were left to create a nice communal vibe.Los Angeles wasn't really my cup of tea, I much preferred Santa Monica.

At 5pm, We decided to get dinner at the first original Bubba Gump restaurant since we have already parked up. Before that we sat at the pier end & took in the stunning views of the sun slowing sinking beneath the horizon. The weather was great with accompanying buskers who provided sweet music to go with the views. While enjoying the view, we saw a few dolphins or seals swam past. The Pacific Park is nothing to shout about, a very dated one and there was hardly any patrons, but you cannot deny the fact that the park did add much colour to this pier.",Made in Singapore

40,"A nice sandy beach, overall","This a 3-1/2-mile long beach, with white, fairly clean sand. It can get a bit crowded in summer, but it's not too bad most of the year. There are also places to buy food and drinks right on the beach.",MaineGuy777
40,"Nice Beach, lots of stuff to see including bums","Nice Beach, great boardwalk, lots of things to see. Like everywhere that caters to the homeless, you have bums there, and that is a turn off for me. But its still very nice",Mark G
40,"Mesmerizing, a must-go tourist attraction","Ever played GTA V? I have and I really loved the place, its so much fun in game and it was more fun visiting it in person. Ample parking space, clean beach and so many food options and souvenirs to choose from. Simply mesmerizing.",Deepak Srivastava
40,Nice but not quiet,"Great beach and view but had to deal with a lot of homeless folks and people hawking food, umbrellas, toys, and whatever else... hard to relax on the beach. Also, my wife has a pretty awesome bikini body, and has shown it off at beaches around the world, but felt very uncomfortable here by all the guys (and girls!!) gawking at her....",DarkSolstice

40,Beautiful beach with a lot of fun,"We came down to LA from rainy and chilly Seattle, and Santa Monica Beach didn't turn us down. Parking was much easier than a lot of other city beaches, and there was full of music, food, coffee, and relaxing people. Never too crowded, but still plenty of people.",KirklandTom
10,"Dirty, homeless people, felt unsafe.","We visited early in the morning at sunrise to get some photos of the pier. Genuinely felt unsafe, i was worried waling on the sand that there might be needles/glass/debris. There was rubbish all on the beach as well as bins which were an eyesore.wouldnt bother again.",AshBush
50,Beautiful beach. Must Visit!!,"We went there on Thanksgiving day, so parking wasn't really a problem. Got right near to Pier. The beach is pretty big and has lots of open showers and rest rooms where you can change. The beach waters are pretty clean with good waves to play with and good views around with lot of palm trees. The play and work out area with lots of bars. Swings and swing bars are fun for both adults (better for fit people) and kids. My kids aged 8 & 10 and both of us had a great time. Spent around 3 hours",Kaustubh M

Lots of room, clean and tidy, life guards on duty, family friendly and with amenities close by on the pier. The only thing that distracted from the peace were the screaming kids on the rides on the pier - it is possible to block this out. Great beach to see the sunset!",sosman2607
50,Beautiful,"Went there early on a Saturday morning, was great. Full of locals walking their dogs, jogging or cycling, was a nice vibe. Walked from Venice Beach to Santa Monica Pier and back which was a long walk but worth it.",babsd33
50,Sand and Ocean - what more could you want?,"I loved this beach. The pier gives you a nostalgic, old-timey feel, with tasty seafood and an old amusement park. The beach is very wide/deep, with soft white sand. We walked from the pier to Venice Beach with our feet in the water, and back along the boardwalk. Loved every second of it.",TRIPTravel
50,BEAUTIFULLY GROOMED - Absolutely HUGE - STRETCHES as far as the eye can see,"As an Aussie from Melbourne, always thought we had the best beaches - not so anymore. We were here in the Autumn month of October, beaches were not populated, so what we saw were amazing, clean, vast, well groomed shorelines, truly awesome.We were also very impressed by the amount of Life Saver stations, placed strategically apart, close to the water's edge.Very impressive and it is clearly evident why this would be such a popular seaside destination in the summer months.",ChristinaMCGM
50,Must See while in Cali,This is a must see destination while in Cali. Ride the rides and enjoy the food and play a few games.,Momof2lovestraveling
10,"Dirty, Feels Unsafe, Homeless Problem","I can only describe the beach and pier as a total dump.The place is overrun with beggars and vagrants. The whole vibe is ruined when you see someone spaced out smoking crack on the street.The homeless are like seagulls. If you feed one, you get bombarded by hundreds.That’s is what’s happening here.Yes it’s unfortunate, yes that sounds harsh. But the city needs to move these people on as its doing irreparable damage to a wonderful place.Not all all suitable for families.",Trfel
50,Can't Wait To Return!!!,"I am back in the big state of Kansas right now after being on the beach in October and can't wait to get back to my Santa Monica beach!

40,Gorgeous,"This was my first west coast beach to visit and I have to say: I wasn't disappointed. The mountains in the background blew my mind and both my friend and I just sat there for hours taking and soaking it all in. I never understood the hype of California: overcrowded, overpriced, bad drivers- but now I can totally understand why people love it here:)Also, wasn't too crowded for a Saturday and the temperature reached 68 and sunnny - perfect :)",Emily F

40,Great place for a walk....very enjoyable morning walk location,"We went for a morning walk along the beach and it was awesome. The paths accommodate both bikes, walkers and runners.

40,Massive Beach,A great massive beach for the whole family and is easily accessible via car or public transport. There is so much room I cannot imagine the beach ever being full. It is also next to the famous pier where you can also buy food and drink or go to the toilet. The only downside is there is a bit of a bit of a drop off into the water from the beach but it is still good for a paddle,Anthony S
50,Beautiful beach for a day out or afternoon stroll.,"I live here in Santa Monica so I'm biased. I go to the beach at least once a week. It's a great place for a day out with friends. Bring your umbrella or a tent and a cooler. If you skip the cooler, there are various snack bars along the beach as well as people walking around selling fruit, water, and even umbrellas. There are also multiple bathroom stops along the boardwalk for families. If you're used to the caribbean beaches, though, this probably isn't your cup of tea. The beach is much longer, the water is much colder and the water isn't crystal clear.",triciachatter
50,"Great beach with nearby food, shops and public transportation","There aren't too many ""bad"" beaches in the Los Angeles area; the coastline offers broad vistas and long, wide beaches with fine sand. What sets Santa Monica Beach apart is its proximity to lots of food and shopping options in downtown Santa Monica and on the Pier -- and now also the beach's unique accessibility via the city's new light rail Metro system, with the Expo line terminating just a short walk from Santa Monica Pier and the beach. This is huge, since beach parking costs have always been a downside of the area.The beach is clean and spacious and almost never very crowded. The water is usually colder than east coast beaches (south of Cape Cod), and one needs to be mindful of sudden drops in the sea floor and significant riptides that can take an inexperienced swimmer by surprise. It seems that fewer people here go into the water than where I grew up in New England, but the beach itself is most enjoyable and well-maintained.",Cheryl M
50,Great fun....Best People Watching,"Grab (or rent) your bike, rollerblades, or just plain sneakers and get out here! Don't forget your camera.

20,This beach has gone downhill....,"The water was brown and full of seaweed/kelp. The water smelled and it was terribly crowded and I couldn't believe that people were actually swimming in the smelly, brown water. The beach itself was nice and clean, the pier was nice and touristy and a great place to people watch, but the water was icky. You can actually see the brown water in my pictures. Last time I was here, many, many years ago, I put my feet in the Pacific here....I wouldn't stick a toe in the water now until it gets cleaned up and stops smelling so foul. Blech!",jbrenz

40,Great beach - be early for easy parking,"A great beach with nice waves and life guards. The restrooms where pretty ok as well. LIttle tricky to park if you come during the day. BEst is to park on the streets above the beach, much easier when you should leave. A bit of jam getting out of the larger Parking lots",LG4KL
20,Pretty from afar,"Great place to walk the pier or watch the sunset from one of the many hotels or restaurants, but not the beach you want to lay out at or being the family. The homeless population is quite high in this area and many were camped out on the beach or the park. We were walking down at 10:30am to walk and get some sun, we passed many aggressive homeless people and even saw one standing up peeing on the beach. After that, we didn't stay long. Was a little concerned about what else might be in the sand.",Teresa L

50,Iconic and wonderful beach,"Like taking part of an episode of 'Baywatch'! Iconic beach, and its popularity is understandable: he swim itself is great, the sand is just like beach sand is supposed to be, and the ambiance of the place with the pier nearby is both bustling and laid back. Take a stroll (or grab a bike) from Santa Monica Beach to Venice Beach: Amazing!",Thomas A
50,Wide beautiful clean beach,"We hung out on the beach for a couple of days while visiting the area. There's a long boardwalk to walk or bike ride.

40,The sand is so soft!,"Santa Monica beach... is miles of beautiful sand. We stopped by here while shopping at 3rd St Promenade.As we walked along the beach, the closer we got to the pier, the stinkier it was. It smelled like rotting fish. The sand was soft and seemed to go on forever. You could see a haze in the air (smog) and there were riptide warnings, so we didn’t go into the water.The public bathrooms were disgusting. I came across one stall that had diarrhea explosion. It was all over the wall and toilet. There’s no toilet paper or soap in these washrooms and I don’t think they get cleaned very often.There’s an aquarium under the pier, restaurants, vendors and even a solar powered Ferris wheel. There are lots of things to do down at the beach and pier.",gareauk

40,Really cool place,"This place is so not what I was expecting; $5 bus ride for the whole family from west Hollywood which took about 15 mins.My kids loved it here. They were on the play equipment if that's what you call it. Monkey bars, climbing ropes, these rope swingy things for ages.We also rode along the beach in rental bikes which was heaps of fun, seen a lot of stacks..People selling $1 drinks of water or soft drinks come riding past on skateboards or bikes which was handy.This place is people watching at its absolute best, loved it.The beach is massive, I have never seen so much beach sand in one place.Can't wait to go back",Mathew R

30,Interesting place,"I have mixed feelings about this place. Being from Australia and spoilt when it comes to beautiful beaches, the actual beach/ocean is nothing special and certainly not worth the time. The real attraction of this place is all of the activity going on around it. Ranging from all of the muscle-beach type workout areas, to the locals getting together and providing street performances/music/dancing etc. The real contrast to Australia was that the place was fairly quiet and boring during the morning and then came to life in the afternoon.The reason for visiting is to experience the culture, nothing like what we have back home. We stayed near the Santa Monica Pier, which is another reason to come here.",GlenFC
30,Go with an open mind,"Santa Monica beach is a nice beach but not one of the best places to visit, if your short on time and can visit 2 beaches come here because of the pier, it is fun and close to the beach. However the Beach itself is somewhat dirty, the sand is not the greatest but it works out well if your in a pinch for time.",Gracie V

30,Decent Beach,"Santa Monica Beach is cool and picturesque from afar, but it’s not the best “beach” it’s kind of dirty and suffers from an abundance of homeless.

50,Beautiful sandy beach,We were very impressed with our visit to the wide sandy beach at Santa Monica. The beach has lifeguards and lots of areas for games like beach volleyball.

30,Cool beach visit!,"My nieces loved this place. The other beaches we went to were more Sandy in the water than this one, which was good. The waves were perfect, not to strong for the smaller niece, and okay to go out further a little more. We went from 330-645 and it was nice, a little chilly but the sun warmed you up. The water was pretty cold at first. When we were leaving the beach, I did step on a piece of glass that was buried in the sand, it didn't break the skin but it could have been a lot worse if it did, or if my nieces would have stepped on it.

50,Sunrise at Santa Monica ... Pure ecstasy!,"The first time when I visited the US, one of my friends back home suggested to pay a visit to Santa Monica, when I go to LA. I had the experience of unclean beaches (empty disposable water bottles, food packets, other plastic waste) in the past back home and hence I was not very much interested. Once, I checked into the hotel, the room had this brochures with all tourist spots nearby and this was one of themI decided to give it a try. I'm glad that I had taken the best decision. Santa Monica is a delight. And being a solo indian girl, I realized that it is very safe too! Sunrise at Santa Monica is beyond words. A must see, for everyone who visit California. You could even pedal a cycle. A very clean white sandy beach with an extremely beautiful sea! You could get food, water and everything else. Public transport is available to reach.",Coolkid-Blore
30,Great for relaxing,"Beautiful beach to walk, bike & lounge at. Not so sure about the actually swimming. DO NOT SWIM near the pier - the water is filthy.For my level, I find the water on the rough & cool side - so I prefer to just hang out.There is a LOT of sand, so prepareto walk for quite a distance before hitting the ocean.Try to come without a car or not during holidays. Parking AT the beach can be super challenging when its a holiday or weekend.I love coming here to relax & you would too.

Cycling down through the tree lined Santa Monica streets towards the coastline was very enjoyable.At the coast there is a brilliant cycle path that goes all the way from Santa Monica down to Venice beach (and much further south also apparently). Santa Monica beach was great to cycle down - the sea breeze feels really nice after coming out of the heat of the city. (You also go past lots of beach volleyball courts on the way.)",Stephen S
50,Beach,"Beach is beautiful golden sand with the pier in the middle, Route 66 sign is a must for a photo, muscle beach to the left of the pier (facing ocean) is worth a look, left hand side of pier is less crowded due the car park on the other side, wouldn't walk under the pier due to the large number of homeless about (just me), also free wifi spot, if you get bored sunbathing, plenty of life guards around and shallow enough to walk out (which we did) don't go to close to pier for this, watch for the sea mist which can come n very fast.",Howard T
50,Iconic Beach Fun,"Maybe too touristy for some, but this cliffside paradise of sun and ocean with mountain views and pier-top rollercoaster/ferriswheel has gotta be on your vacation bucket list. Great for people watching, high end shopping and dining. Head down to Hermosa for more earthy beach-town relaxation....Santa Monica is bubbling over with fast-paced beach fun!",PoboySr

50,Amazing Huge Sandy Beach,Had several walks along the beach. Very beautiful and teams were picking up litter although there was little in the first place.Good showers and toilets every few hundred yards.Pedestrian and cycle path runs along the inland side of the beach. Plenty of cycle and Segway hire.,Glenn H
50,Lovely Beach,"Relatively small beach, has the santa monica pier and boardwalk. Very nice tourist attraction. Cool graffiti pillars that the city provides to the local graffiti artists to use legally and it gets repainted every month for new art. Very nice stop, lots to see.",Kalie R
50,Beach fun on beautiful Santa Monica beach is the best.,My daughter & 6 year old granddaughter have visited Santa Monica Beach for 4 years & we will return 2018.

40,great views of the coast line!,To the right of the pier there were some awesome views of the coastline and cliffs hidden in fogg.... very cool... water was a little cold but its almost October... parking was $12.. but go on a weekday if you can manage for a better beach experience!,gpeshee
50,Beautiful & Clean,"Santa Monica Beach is so beautiful and very clean. The view of the ocean, mountains and planes taking off from LAX is a delight. When the sun set there is no better view than from the beach. The atmosphere, sand and views are priceless.",Harold R
50,5 Star beach,It's a great beach with gorgeous sunset views. You can see the Santa Monica pier and city in background. Beach has nice grainy sand and is clean.Many parking available.,Anand1351

50,Beautiful Views,You must spend at least one day lounging on beautiful Santa Monica beach. There is always a breeze and slight waves so you don't overheat.,Bossy075
50,Expansive beach that is quintessential California,"The Santa Monica Beach is quintessential Southern California with sweeping coastal views of the mountains, boardwalk amusement park and palm trees.The beach is immaculately well-kept and local city workers clean it every morning. It's a fantastic place to read, nap, walk, write, run, play, swim, dig, create, jog, roller blade, eat, and relax.It's as inspiring as it gets in Southern California.",unabashedly
50,Love Santa Monica,"ok- so there are better beaches, but Santa Monica is Santa Monica. Great people watching, broad beaches and killer waves This beach is well maintained and close to shopping, restaurants and upscale hotels. I highly recommend staying near here when in LA.",JaneBennet
40,A clean beach with easy access to the ocean,"We spent Sunday here arriving at about 1030 in the morning and leaving in the early evening. It is an easy walk from the car park onto the beach and we took beach towels with us to relax on. There are beach vendors selling fruit, ice creams, umbrellas, body boards etc but they were non intrusive and just added to the atmosphere. We are not big on sandy beaches but the sand itself is clean, quite fine grained and comfortable to sit/ lie on stretching north and south for many miles.It's a great place to people watch and when it's too hot the sea is very inviting. The waves can crash down on the shore depending on the direction of the wind so if you are going with little ones take care.",Mistyb1302
50,"Santa Monica Pier, Malibu Beach, Celebrity Homes Tour, Pacific Park","We went to Santa Monica Pier, very nice beach. We then took a Guided Tour to all the celebrity beach houses along Highway 1 towards Malibu beach. In the afternoon, we went to the Pacific Park, very nice view of the beach from the TOP of the Ferris wheel.",AlanChua33
40,Beach as Far as the Eye Can See,"The beach is expansive, wasn't expecting it to be such a stretch from the road to the ocean. Stretch as in size much bigger than I was expecting. You can also walk the entire beach length to Venice (at least 30 minutes).When you first arrive at Santa Monica beach, you can trail on the sand or look for one of the nearby pier paths that take you halfway then it's all sand.Look where you're walking there is debris in the sand.Ocean side, a variety of shells can be found. The water is fresh.There are public washrooms along the way, but not necessarily the most pleasant.Walking along the beach you will see the classic Californian life guard huts.There are also a variety of restaurants closer to the road side of the beach.",dtvl
40,Rest days after busy Cali Tour,"We visited SanMo beach having had 10 x days of non stop sight seeing. The beach proved the perfect respite.First of all there is Muscle beach - which was not what I expected. Basically it's a ""body weight"" work out facility, with Olympic Rings, chin up bars, parallel bars, climbing ropes, etc and yoga space.SanMo beach IS NOT Venice beach, where the gym is!!A short walk away is SanMo pier, with its iridescent lights! It's noisy, busy, popular and loads of fun. Food, rides, snacks.The beach itself is clean white sand, approximately 200 yards from kerbs and cycle paths to the waters edge.The water is clean with some seaweed, with rolling 3-4 ft waves. Perfect for children over 8 to swim and surf in! And of course even if you do take your eye off them, the lifeguards (of baywatch fame) are on hand observing from those iconic huts.Have fun!",Joe W

50,Beautiful Beach!!!,"Wonderful, huge, clean, incredible beach. We had a blast that day. The sand is perfect, nice people, you can have nice walks, you can rent a bike, skateboard, e-bike or whatever and ride it on the special sidewalks and have the ocean breeze just next to you.Loved the workout place just close to the beach. Per total awesome place for weekends or days off.",sirioga86

40,it's .... a beach,"It's a nice beach at Santa Monica next to the Pier. The facilities around are not very modern or very special in general, so 4 points is just the right scoring. There are not many restaurants or shady places.",Maximilian H
30,I liked venice beach more,A decent beach but it gets insanely crowded.Something I disliked was the rows of garbage cans...you could smell it while laying in the sand.There arent many trees on the beach for shadeIt really doesn't have much personality. Check out venice beach!,Chelsea J
40,Beautiful beach,"Great white sandy beach very big and lots of space. I went down on a Sunday afternoon and had no problem finding somewhere to sit. It's close to the pier and local amenities water fountain/ toilets. Not so good for disabled access, not that I saw anyway.",Emma B
40,All depends on the weather,"wide beach, cold water, no shadow, separat places for surfers and those taking bath, many dustbins, the shore has for long way not a deep water.",AlexaKPL

50,"Very clean, safe, great for kids","We spent a morning with the kids , they played in the water, the beach was spotless, clean, outdoor showers were great, toilets were clean and open for use, the bins and walkway were clean and we went to a cafe for ice creams. It was a great morning",Martin G
50,AS GOOD AS IT GETS,"Miles upon miles, or so it seems, of wonderfully clean and toasty sand. They do an amazing job of grooming the beach. It always looks pristine. Full of life with people playing in the surf. Go for a dip or just enjoy the sounds of the surf. A must experience.",SenorGancho
30,Good for photo,"I won't spend too long here, 30mins max for a photo unless you love beach. Not a must destination to visit",MyViaCeNox
40,Mind the Destitute,"Beautiful, groomed, incredibly wide sandy beach with nearby hotels, restaurants, pubs, etc.It would be perfect, were it not for the large destitute population, even more than elsewhere in LA (which is saying something).I'm sensitive to their plight, and this is obviously a systemic issue in our society that we need to do a better job addressing. But their incredibly poor health distracts and detracts from the beauty of the natural environment. Call me insensitive, but I wouldn't recommend bringing small children here, which is a shame.",NavyJAG
50,It is just nice there,Strolling on the beach and enjoying the view. really didn't do anything else worth mentioning. But definitely worth going there,Soheila S

50,Lots of sand,"Its a loverly big wide and very long beach, so always able to find a spot to relax. The lifeguards are amazing and huts set 100m apart for the miles of beach, so you feel very safe. Shame about all the homeless people who sleep rough on the beach, but not a lot you can do about them and at no time did any of them approach me of we frlt threatened, Just sorry for them.",Neil_and_Hazel
50,Lovely,VeryClean!!!! and even though there is a lot of people you can't really tell.. There's enough room for everyone!!! From kite flying to playing in the ocean to skate boarders and bike riders to long leisurely strolls you can do it all there😁,Sw33t33pi
50,Have a beach-in good time!,Nice beach with lots of room for all the people that are there to visit. I was able to find parking very close by on the street but they also have lots where you can pay to park near the beach.This beach has very close rentals and places to eat as you walk along it.,Sarah K
50,Approachable by the Metro,"Approachable by the Metro. That means most families in Los Angeles can get to a great beach. Not a calm or serene beach. Nearly always busy. Flat, rest rooms, and a great corn dog stand. Water quality is sometimes iffy as the storm drains over flow onto the beach.Still, it is one of the iconic people's beach in Los Angeles.",Cavydad
50,What CA is all about,"A long wide beach, with apparently very little tide. A peaceful ocean that dazzles in the Californian sun. An ordered and spotless beach that is laid back and welcoming; it invites you to its shore. A stroll along this is a little bit of heaven on earth.",ghk1857

50,Never ends,This beach is unbelievable. It's not enough that it goes on and on and on; that you can walk or bike it for miles; that you can stop and have a drink or snack or take a ferriswheel ride but there are gorgeous hills in the background!! Amazing.,pap77
50,Outstanding beach,Really beautiful beach. Much cleaner than the Venice Beach area. They have a walkway to the water to save your feet from the hot sand. They also have showers/restroom and changing area. Really great bike path that runs along the beach as well.,Jkarr11
20,"Yes, but NO !","Nice city, but it's overcrowded and during late hours on Friday, Saturday whole day and beginning of Sunday it's hard to drive in it. Use bikes! The beach is like that:no changing rooms (so you're having fun in stink-slippery restrooms), not too many showers, no umbrellas whatsoever, no sun loungers, bring your towel. Parking is a hell on weekends. Waters are a mixture of sand and foam, but doesn't stink. Best place to go into water is between 24 and 27 stations. Food is limited and of poor quality. Homelessness flourishes during the night and morning hours. Folks walk and ride the bikes on the same path. Injures are frequent. Pay attention! As an option - go to Laguna Beach. At least water is warmer. As a tour guide I don't recommend to swim at Santa Monica Beach, just visit it and walk around.",Vladimir D
50,Beautiful beach,A beautiful beach and a must do if you are visiting the area of LAThe breeze is really nice but the sun is hot be careful not to burn,Tara J
50,Biking along the beach,Must do ! Rent a bike and go along the beach line to Venice beach. You see a 1000 things and people and colors with a nice breeze on your face.,Anda v
50,Amazing Beach,"Santa Monica beach is a must visit while in Los Angeles. The atmosphere and vibe is vibrant and has such beautiful views. I visited this place for the first time recently and I found the beach to be very clean and there is more than enough space for everyone on the beach. Although there aren't any trees for shade, I would suggest bringing a beach umbrella if you plan to stay long. There is a water stand to wash off your feet and body too. Attached to the beach is the pier with lots of entertainment and food parlours there. It is a good place to bring the family. I'd love to go back to Santa Monica and spend the day there again.",Matthew C
50,Got to love santa Monica,I love going to Santa Monica Beach early in the morning to run and work out. Before it get busy and crowded.,Mrtravelbee
20,Beach is lovely - Local homeless people are offensive and rude,We went expecting what you see on the TV. It was far from it. Location is nice and the beach is worth a visit. However to get to the beach you have to walk past numerous homeless people. These people are rude and offensive and really put us off.Two were rude to my wife and a third scared my kids. Would not recommend going.,Jon Barnsley
40,Clean beach,"People watching, strolling or just chilling. A pleasant beach with facilities. Easily accessible on foot or by car.",Carol E
50,A Must See!,"Boy oh boy, Santa Monica was everything I expected and more. The beach was beautiful and full of life. There were people exercising, roller skating, riding bikes, couples, families with small children. There is something for everyone regardless of the age. We were able to enjoy the amazing talents of people showcasing their skills. In walking distance there are an abundance of restaurants and shopping!!",Rodjohn
40,Plenty to see !!,Lots of folks doing their daily exercises - we Brits would call it posing ! Very expansive beach. Area with lots of volley ball nets. Quite clean but not quite the sparking place that you see on TV.,K677TQrobins
50,very hott,just off the pier is the beach and you cant miss it because its so big and runs all the way down the coast line great swimming spots and theres life guards every so many meters and theres a nice path to hire bikes and push prams on all good beach lite waves so its good for kids also we will back,Marunui187
40,Bay watch beach,"I think they filmed bay watch here , if not it's the next beach along . Either way they could have . Big watchtowers with lifeguards , yellow trucks and orange cans . Didn't see Pam or David . The beach is massive . Most of the time it was a bit windy and the sun lounger by the pool with a bar just seemed so much more inviting . However if our hotel was a little further back from the front I think we would have been on it",Corkey1972
50,Beach please,This beach is one of the must visit beaches while in LA. On saturday the beach was full of people but in the middle of the week there were more space. Pier next to the beach gives it its lovely atmosphere.,besterlund
50,What a beach,"Such a massive beach with lots to do on it. Games to play, walking, sport, people watching & eating & drinking. Beautiful views and great weather most days. Would be fab to have a house here!",AnnieMac
30,Santa Monica beach,"I visited this beach for the first time, having frequently visited other US beaches. It's not too bad for a US beach... It's huge. In my opinion that's its downfall, it's just too big and the sea too far out. Another reason it isn't my favourite is it's location. Smack bang in the middle of the city. A huge congested smoggy freeway surrounds the beach destroying any connection with nature and sea breeze I was hoping to get. Its OK once your actually on the beach itself but really dosent come close to Venice beaches charm and character.",Lee R
40,nice beach but nothing special,Santa Monica means going to the pier and the beach is somewhat of an accessory. It is a nice beach but I would not especially come here for it.,Natalie B
50,Santa Monica Sunset,"Celebrating our 20th wedding anniversary in California so we thought we would drive from Palm Springs to Santa Monica to watch an ocean sunset.Let me tell you it is spectacular, the pier was packed with people watching the sunset, absolutely beautiful.",Ottr60
50,Breathtaking!,"Even with the insanely crowded weekend around 4th of July, Santa Monica beach left me amazed by its beauty. The pier, road side restaurants, and the beach in itself - everything makes you fall in love with LA. Also the location where one of the popular songs of the movie 'La La Land' is shot. Highly recommended.",Ritika J
50,Just one of LA's great beaches.,"If you're looking for a tourist attraction this is definitely it. Walking distance from the pier, rides, restaurants. It can get pretty full of hundreds of people at one time. Would highly recommend if you're visiting LA.",Aajramirez
50,"Soft, sandy and clean beach",I would highly recommend Santa Monica beach. The sand is soft and the beach is clean. The beach gets quieter the farther away you go from Venice Beach and the Santa Monica pier so your bound to have a better time.,Shannon C
40,Beautiful sunset,"Santa Monica beach is a beautiful place to visit. However, its highlight maybe is the sunset, as well as you can spend the day swimming there.",PezFish
50,Like in Baywatch,"What a beitiful experience to spend an entire day here! The beach is so long that it feels like it's your own! Everything is really ut i don't suggest you to immerge yourself in the ocean water, cause it can be really really cold!! Be sure to bring some drinks with you!",biagiottiasia
40,BEAUTIFUL BIG BEACH!,This is one of the biggest beaches I have ever seen. It goes on and on and on. I am from Florida (where some of the most beautiful beaches are located) but this was still something to see. There were lots of people swimming but it was way to cold for me.,angelcindy
40,"The widest ,longest beach I ever seen!!",Incredible beach.Awesome panoramic views.Its so wide.and long it goes on for miles.Venice and Malibu beaches are not to far away.But the moment I saw this beach it was so impressed to see how wide it is.A must see to believe!!,Embert j espinal
50,"Comfortable sand, beautiful water, great weather","Amazing time laying in the sun, not sweating and enjoying the pure sunshine. Water was cold at first but very worth it getting in and riding the waves. Sand brushes off. On weekends, make sure to get a mango pack from guy walking around selling them on the beach.",Shan B
50,Beautiful,"Beautiful beach to chill at with lots of restaurants, shopping, & close to the train. Awesome place to have a break from city life.",Cini T
50,Beautiful day out on the beach!,"Came down on a Thursday and found a clean golden beach buzzing with lots of families and couples. Fairly shallow water but keep a close eye on your kids.The nearby pier attractions and restrooms/ open showers are a Godsend. A little further away are the regular high street shops and restaurants.Massive car park too. Plenty of space on the beach (parasols, buckets etc. are available to buy from the pier).NBExpect lots of pigeons and seagulls near to the pier.Expect street vendors - none were pushy in our experience.Expect the usual funfair (pricey) experience on the pier.Highly recommend.",Gurinder D
50,Lovely beach,"Very crowned pl;ace lots to do and walk too. Great for sightseeing and people watching. I would recommend coming here on the week days much less crowned, but you can also walk to the promenade lots to do and see.",Amy B

30,Could use some policing,What a beautiful beach and location but too many homeless people floating around. We were here with kids and were surrounded by people smoking marijuana and acting a bit silly. It's a beach town that could use a good clean up.,joseph b
40,~~ Soft sand and big breaking waves await you! ~~,"Having been raised on the south western coast of England, now living in the midwest of the USA, we miss a good beach. Recently in CA our nephew took us to Santa Monica. What a treat!Yes, the beach is busy but there was plenty of room in the sea/ocean. The waves break high and quite far out so we all had a blast from adults all the way down to our youngest, a 7 year old. We were there in August and the water was surprisingly warm.Parking? We parked down by the beach beside the pier. The price was $12 for all day so really not that bad and very convenient. It was just a short walk to the pier and sea front.Lifeguards were in attendance all along the beach. You will also experience beach vendors walking back and forth enticing you to pay over the normal retail price for buckets and spades, boogie boards, tacos, mangoes etc. This actually turned out to be a blessing for us as we had tried to purchase a bucket and spade the day before but the store had sold out. It was worth paying the extra so that our kids could have fun digging and creating in the sand.All had a lovely time :)",chventures
50,Fantastic beach,What an amazing beach. Super clean and friendly. Its beauty is magnified by surrounding mountains. Not to be missed.,ALMAR1988
50,One of My Favorites,Only been once but my visit was great. The pier is filled with action but the beach is relaxing and about a mile and a half from Venice Beach.,Andre Thomas
40,Super crowded but nice to swim,"Super crowded, super touristy but this is one of the best beaches in Cali if you want to go for a swim. Lots of vendors around.",travellistics
40,A beautiful beach,"Santa Monica Beach is a great beach, paying for that beach is a pleasure.But parking is pricey. and little bit overcrowded",Maddy I
30,Too Crowded and Touristy,"When walking on the path along the sand, you have to be on the lookout for bicycles coming and going. The enormous pier is too crowded. There are lots of tourist shops, kiosks, musicians playing songs and singing - that all makes the pier an interesting place to walk. However, we prefer Venice Beach where it is not crowded and you can actually enjoy the beach atmosphere.",Kabear
30,This picture is worth one word: photoshop. B/c this beach is always crowded.,"If you like being jostled about by hundreds of people in your personal space, this is the beach for you!",Andrea C
30,A bit overhyped!,"I came to Santa Monica beach with every intention of being impressed but I just...wasn't. It's an okay beach but come on, this can't be the best beach California has to offer? There are a lot of homeless and people who are clearly on a lot of drugs, It wasn't exactly relaxing. Besides that the beach was buzzing with activity and the pier was action packed. It's a good place to people watch for a while.",deathbyblackcat
50,Beautiful sandy beach,"Busy and quite a few homeless people. But sandy and deep beautiful beach. People cycling , working out , relaxing.",concepta747
50,A beautiful beach as usual,Santa Monica Beach has been a great beach since I was a child 60 years ago. It is even better now: kept absolutely pristine and clean; more lifeguards than people on some days; huge enough to fit lots of people; eats nearby; parking is pricey but oh well: paying for that beach is a pleasure.,pasoduo
20,Overcrowded,"I would not recommend this beach especially after visiting Pacific Beach in SD and Newport Beach, this beach was kinda gross. It was a long walk from the street to the water, kids running amok over my towels and people washing their kids in the limited outdoor showers as if they dont have running water at home.",Monica Y
30,Be careful where you walk,"The beach is sand, sand, needle, cigarette butt, sand, wire, sand, used nappy, sand, cigarette butt, sand, metal edged something, sand ... You get the picture. Don't go barefoot in the sand because God alone knows what you'll stand in. It really is something to paddle in the Pacific and the beach is crazy busy but the detrius left in the sand really detracts from what could be a beautiful place. The homeless people that line the walkways, along with the fruit and water peddlars make it an interesting experience getting to and from the beach/pier and so you have to be pretty brave to come here.",Emma S
30,RV visit/bike ride/Route 66,I love Santa Monica Beach! It is clean. The cost of parking an RV is $48. Outrageous! We did have fun riding our bikes along the beach and stopping at a café along the way. It was crowded on the Pier. They do have a nice route 66 booth at the beginning of the Pier and a great photo opportunity. Take a picture at the end of route 66.,Dmcclenathen
50,Beautiful,"This beach is very clean , sand is lovely and the views are excellent. Defently worth a visit if you get the chance. The only disappointment was the number of homeless hanging around the beach, some of them were very vocal and a little off putting if you were there alone",Sue K
50,Day out,"We had the day here. Bought body boards for 2 children, a must. The sea is fairly rough along here and some surfers. Suggest not wearing your best bathing suit as ingrained with sand more than usual. Safe place as plenty of lifeguards on duty. Beach clean and toilets to use. Sadly along beach walkway seems to be a few homeless who do keep themselves to themselves. We have found this a lot in Santa monica.",Alison S
40,"Great Waves, Beach was clean for us","We definitely enjoy ourselves.. Some of the waves knocked us around a bit. Parking was pretty easy for a Friday morning.. It did get more crowded after lunch, but beautiful weather, and a great place to be.. Dont let the negative nancys stop you from coming..",crazistevoh

50,Difficult to put into words how good this beach is,"This isn't just a normal beach, there's more to do on this beach than any other I've ever been on. In the space of a 20 minute walk you can chill, sunbathe, swim, swing, play football, volleyball, do yoga, bike ride, do gym workouts. All of these have there own areas on the beach and there's so much room for each one. Crystal clear water and also bins all along the walkway so there's no litter in site.",Sean N

There is a spot for beach volleyball and a playground for the kids. You can also go to the Santa Monica Pier which is part of the beach. Just relax, have fund and soak up the sun. Parking will not be a problem.",pejenn

40,Biggest Beach I've ever seen,"The size of Santa Monica beach is off the scale. It must be about 800m deep but all the action is at the sea front!We visited on a weekend when half of LA arrived so it was busy enough, very hot but able to find space no problem, our hotel supplied towels.Most will have food And drink for their day as it is such a journey to get anything from the sea unless you are near the Pier.Beach is very clean and groomed each night, but seriously wouldn't want to live down beach side. As you will see it is so busy and with the highway cutting in between the beach and the Promenade along with the noise and garbage, beach side living could be a lot better!",andhewittscores

Next to each lot are free restrooms large enough to change in with free outdoor showers to clean the sand off after swimming. This time of year, the water was so warm! We swam in the ocean and played in the waves. No lifeguards so be sure to use the buddy system and watch the undertow. Perfect beach to watch the sunset behind the mountains and plenty of fine sand for castles.",Michelle B

50,What a beach !,The beach seems to be cleaned every day. It has many Life Guard stations. There is some parking near by and is either side of the Pier. The actual sea front is a long way away from the road side. The surf was excellent. Wish we had longer. Take some shade and seats with you.,PFTraveller62
40,Lovely clean beach,"This beach is great for couples/families/friends! Very clean and has shower & toilet facilities. We paid to park in lot 5, which was $10, but you could stay as long as you liked. Sea is pretty choppy so you would need to supervise any little ones very carefully if they wanted to go in the water. We left our belongings on the beach with our towels and they were safe the whole time we were in the water. They have lifeguards on duty on this beach, and also helicopters/planes checking for shark activity along the shoreline.Don't let that put you off though! This is a really lovely beach and well worth a visit.",Amy W

50,Superb beach on the Pacific,"Santa Monica beach is wonderful. We were lucky enough to be staying within walking distance and did not have to worry about parking. We ensured we had a paddle to say we had been in the Pacific Ocean, a first for us.The sand is golden and there are life guard towers every 100m along the shoreline. My partner manage to lose her mobile phone on the sand, but a kind and wonderful lady found it and contacted me as one of the last numbers and she was reunited with her phone.An excellent accompaniment when visiting Santa Monica Pier.",Martin G
40,Beautiful Beach,"This beach is seated right next to Venice Beach. Both beaches are very clean, but the boardwalk is the big difference between the two. Santa Monica seems a little more uppity and clean and Venice really caters to the more eclectic groups. There is also a much better parking situation on the Santa Monica side. You're going to pay for parking no matter where you go, but on the SM side you can at least get a spot near the actual beach and not several blocks away.",Shannon
50,First time...was better than expected,Our first beach trip to California and I was worried about the beach. Once there we found it to be crowded as expected but clean. The folks selling fruit only added to the atmosphere and the many homeless type people were actually not bad. I guess being stoned made them rather mellow. Everyone we encountered it Santa Monica was wonderful. I especially enjoyed hearing the many different languages being spoked by visitors from all over the world.,David C
30,Just a beach,"There really is nothing special about this place.We arrived on our road trip up the west coast expecting to see something spectacular, but really it's underwhelming. I wouldn't go out of your way to visit here.",0908267

50,Vacation,Such a beautiful clean beach. No chair or umbrella rental but you have vendors on the beach selling them. Also vendors selling fruits. Food was very expensive from the cafe but lots of restaurants like 5 mins drive away. You dont have to pay to go on the beach.,Chandanie S

50,"Long beach, good crowd","I really enjoyed laying out at Santa Monica Beach. The beach stretches on for a while and as you get further away from the pier, it is less crowded. There are lifeguards every 50-80 yards or so. The crowd around the bike path and walking path is generally pretty calm and comfortable to walk around. Some dining/lunch options as well and the pier amusement park is nearby,",Christine
40,Evening visit,"We really should have been there in the day to do more. The evening was fun, everything was lit up. We enjoyed it but I would have liked to have had some beach time. We basically walked the pier...some great photo opportunities.",Mary S
20,Amazing beach - seperated from Santa Monica by TWO 6 lane highways,"Nice beach to photograph - shame it is so separated from the rest of Santa Monica ( best link is the bridge by the pier). A downside to the beach ( and Santa Monica in general) is that it seems to house most of LAs 56,000 tramps, hobos, down and outs. Some of whom can be pushy and aggressive ( especially with each other ) which left us feeling a bit edgy, certainly not somewhere I'd feel comfortable my kids wandering about without is in eyeshot.",Williamsfam
50,Fun for all Santa Monica beach,"Great beach with something of interest for most people and wasn't very crowded on a Friday afternoon in August. Has a boardwalk to ride bikes along, a small amusement park with a few rides, Restaurants, playgrounds for young and older alike (work out bars etc), street performers, and lots of beach with decent size waves. There was a commercial filming there when we went. Changing rooms and rinse off showers are onsite as well. $ parking",Jane D
30,Good times,"Fun beach to be on, very large and the waves are nice. It's shallow enough to walk-out a fair bit into the water.It is over-crowded since it's an urban-beach and it's very dirty. Constantly dodging broken glass, cigarette butts, and other detritus.",Warnerdang
50,"Busy, But Fun! Try coming on week days when less busy","Always a fun beach for swimming, light surfing, and people watching. If the waves are good, you can catch the locals trying their craft with the surfboards. There is parking nearby, but you have to pay.",cynsha

50,A must see,"Just west of downtown Los Angeles, Santa Monica contains one of the most legendary beach scenes in the United States. Santa Monica also boasts an abundance of great restaurants and excellent nightlife spots. The 3 miles of shoreline are renowned as some of the best in the area thanks to the soft sands, ideal weather and bevy of attractions. ""State Beach,"" as its known, averages about 340 days of sunshine a year and acted as the backdrop for the popular television series ""Baywatch.""Santa Monica is a very walkable part of town, and many recent visitors suggest you explore the area by bicycle. One of the most scenic rides is along the 26-mile bike path, which runs parallel to the Pacific Ocean and is the longest beach bike path in the world. Travelers also recommend riding the Ferris wheel at the pier and people-watching at the Third Street Promenade.In addition to the famous pier's Ferris wheel, visitors can zip around on a roller coaster, catch lively street performances, play carnival games and grab a bite to eat from one of the food vendors or at a sit-down restaurant. Several bemoaned the high price tag on some of the pier's food and attractions – ride tickets cost $5 to $10 each – but with free entry, your losses will probably be mitigated. The pier is open 24 hours a day, however, hours will vary for local businesses. Parking is plentiful and costs between $6 and $15, depending on the season and lot location. Travelers can also get to the area by taking the Big Blue Bus or riding the Metro's Expo Line to the Downtown Santa Monica station.",ishusangh

40,"Lovely beach, lots of seaweed 😑","We had a lovely time at the Santa Monica beach. It was clean and family friendly. There was a nice crowd with kids playing around, there were also some netball matches in progress. There were hawkers selling towels which was very useful, because I had forgotten to pack towels for the kids. There was also fresh, peeled and sliced fruit being sold which we enjoyed.We couldn't find any changing rooms, as a result of which the kids had to change in the washrooms, which were smelly and dirty.Also watch out, as the waves can be quite strong and there is a strong undercurrent also. My husband lost his new sunglasses which were thrown off when a wave caught him off guard.Overall it's a nice beach to visit.",AbbyUmer

Access from Ocean Ave is interesting to say the least but eventually I found a bridge/ramp combination that wasn't closed. Once at ocean level you're confronted with what looks like a mile of beach before you hit the water. There appears to be a hopping bar and eatery and places to take a break when needed. Great place for people watching or wave watching, whatever you're into.",patrick v

40,Family vacation adult child and 10 year old,"Another bucket list activity checked off. Traffic to get to beach/pier was very busy. Parking to the right of the pier is per day at 12/day, worth it in my opinion. After exploring the pier, grabbing a bite to eat, head down to the beach. The beach is very busy on a mon., afternoon in July. Most folks are considerate. The waves are strong, w/a strong under current & rip tides. Kids can't really ""play"" in the water but have fun standing on shore until the waves hit. A few people were out in much deeper water, most just sitting on beach enjoying the beauty. The water is cold. Warnings are everywhere that mussels, specific fish etc are not fit for human consumption,we witnessed many people panhandling, and arguing with the police/security which I didn't care to have my child witness. I'm not sure if state law in Ca is gender neutral restrooms, but men were in the women's bathrooms. Which I do not approve of with my child. We will just plan not to use public bathrooms in CA, if this is the case.Locals (?) walk around the Beach selling fresh fruit, beach toys, etc. it was a once in a lifetime experience.

The parking lots are ALWAYS full but I would suggest parking in the city of Santa Monica and just walking down the California Incline street. Parking by the beach is nearly impossible.For those who love to go fishing, you are allowed to go fishing on Santa Monica beach with a California Fishing license...you can go off the Santa Monica pier without the license. I actually called the lifeguard stations at Santa Monica beach and they said fishing is okay.

30,Crowded and more touristy than Venice Beach,My main reason for visiting was the Metro stopping at Downtown Santa Monica which is only a 5 minute walk from the beach.The pier itself was crowded and packed with ageing fairground attractions.Santa Monica beach was comparatively crowded and touristy compared to Venice Beach further down the boardwalk.,Mike
30,Okay Beach / Fun Town,"There are lots of rentals to make this beach visitor friendly. You can get umbrella/chairs/tables for the day, bicycles, small boogie boards, towels, scooters, etc. There are also chilled fruit vendors throughout the day and you will see people selling jewellery and small toys. Add in the rides and games on the pier and you can have a nice time with the family here.That being said, people litter a LOT here. We saw food trash, diapers, socks, cigarettes (even though smoking is prohibited) etc and it just makes it hard for me to appreciate the experience. The sand is nice where it is clean and there is really miles of open shore in both directions for you to play in the ocean or spread out a towel. There are also a lot of homeless people sleeping, walking around, talking to themselves, going through the trash, and even selling things. Be prepared to see this everywhere in Santa Monica and if you have kids be prepared to explain it to them. They are out here day and night. Venice beach is more of the same. I think if you wanted to see a beautiful beach there are many of them in California but not this one. Malibu is just a short distance north of here and a better bet! In fairness, though, a west coast sunset is beautiful pretty much anywhere and you should try to catch one if you can!",Heather S

It was the last destination of our 3 weeks US trip, and although we had a great hotel on beach, I will not come back.Basically the pier, beach and city center is totally crowded, so much that you cant walk around easily, its difficult to find place to eat, homeless people everywhere, all making it hard to relax.In addition prices are very high for food, stay and services, plus your hotel bill is added 3 different taxes, including marketing taxes to promote Santa Monica, which makes the crowding even worse.Unfortunately its a downword spiral with more people and increasing costs.

40,Beautiful beach,Very touristic crowd of course but still a must go when visiting L.A.Enjoy the pier with young childrenJust a few parking and of course expensive,Pierre C
50,Summer weekday afternoon visit,"Very popular beach in urban Los Angeles, CA area. Parking is easily available in parking garages across the street, and also in a big beach parking area. We parked in one of the garages, then strolled over to the boardwalk and sandy area. Many shops, dining places and rides are available on the boardwalk. We could have watched the sunset but chose to walk over to an upscale sushi restaurant where we watched the sunset occur. This nice beach has more offerings than a decade ago.",MGN777
40,Huge beach,"Very long and wide beach, cool gymming and play area, but it was quite dirty in places, lots of pigeons too. Best to bring your own sunshade.Sand was very nice, soft and not gravelly. Lots of space to set down. Some dodgey characters around but that just seems to be LA in general, they tend to keep to themselves anyway.",Kevalpatel
50,Loved Santa Monica,I was really impressed with how nice the Santa Monica area is! The Pier was very nice and well kept up. There were lots of attractions for the kids! It was a super busy area though. The beach was pretty crowded compared to the Venice Beach. The Santa Monica area definitely had a better mix of people. Our waiter in Santa Monica actually urged us to stay away from Venice Beach after sunset and he was right. I would definitely recommend visiting the Santa Monica Beach area and Pier!,Katlyn T
30,Not what we expected,"Thought it was dirty and a little unkept. Lots of homeless and rough sleepers. Saw quite a lot of drug use, and didn't hang around for the day as we had planned",bax52
50,Thumbs Up to Santa Monica Beach!,"Don't miss the Santa Monica Beach scene. I don't know where you are coming from but this is uniquely California. From the Pokemon Go hunters on the beach to the performers on the pier, you should not miss this attraction. I have to admit the water is a little bit cold for us Gulf Coasters, but you will get use to it. We enjoyed the visit here so much we opted for another night in Los Angeles so we could visit it again. Parking can be difficult but the State Park has almost unlimited parking.",drb622013
50,Beautiful beach but....,I would go to hermosa beach which is close by. Parking is expensive here. The beach goes on for what seems like miles. Traffic is insane in summer month. Allocate time wisely. Pier is your typical pier however boasts a Ferris wheel.,Tricia B
40,Gorgeous beach,"Lovely beach, clean. Wasn't too busy when we went, which was nice. Lifeguards on duty are reassuring. Was a very hot couple of days while we were there and the sand gets super hot - so take flip flops or expect your feet to burn! Water seems clean and nice. A lovely place for a lazy day.",momma1973
40,Nice Beach!!,"It's a beautiful beach, vey clean, if you are in Los Angeles, I recommendto take a time and visit this beach as well Santa Monica Pier, it's worthyI just came back, the water was cool, but it was a nice place to relax.",BeHappy
50,Must visit!,If you're in LA you must come to Santa Monica beach and area! Beach is beautiful especially at sunset and the pier is a must do as well!The walk along the board walk between Santa Monica and Venice beach is a great way to see the area and the local vibe,Georgia R
40,Beautiful!,"It's hard to find a wider beach, and the Pacific Ocean is always, always my favorite of any in the world I've visited. The waves make for easy surfing, beach volleyball nets are numerous and a simple stroll is good for the soul.",Ginger R
40,Santa Monica beach,"Had a great day out!. We first went to the Santa Monica pier and did the ferris wheel ride which gave you some idea of the size of the beach. We walked from the pier on the main side walk towards Venice Beach. Wow this is certainly a place to people watch and all walks of life are here!!. Had a meal and drink at one of the cafe's adjacent to the side walk and a jazz/rock fusion band started playing opposite us - they were very good so we were completely entertained!. There are wide stretches of sand so a reasonable walk to the sea which was delightful!. I'm not certain if it would be a safe place to go during the night. Please see my ""Youtube"" video's search for MrFabchild",steve c
30,Nice place but parking is $$$!,It's a nice boardwalk and the pier with the park is nice. But it's frustrating to have to deal with parking. All street parking even costs $$$.,Michelle G
50,Awesome ambiance,"Great visit and lots of things to do and see, from bike riding to exercising. Don't miss Muscle Beach.",Leshansen
40,Classic California beach,"The Santa Monica Beach extends for miles from Venice Beach to the south, to the Palisades to the north. The Santa Monica Pier is on the southern portion, and the Pacific Coast Highway runs parallel to much of it. As locals, we prefer the more northern portion. There are many pay parking lots along the way, but nearly no free parking. The beach is VERY wide, particularly in the south, so be prepared for a walk to the water. There's a GREAT bike path that runs the entire length and far beyond.",Dollyamas
50,Summer trip,"Decided to visit with out teenager for a quick summer trip. The beach was packed and the water was freezing in July. We rode the Ferris wheel at sunset, which was beautiful. Great place to hangout. Everything is pretty expensive but the memories made are priceless",Jnjiemtz
30,Overrated,This place has gone down hill want the years. It's a very well known tourist location but the amount of homeless people and random entertainment is getting excessive. It's no longer entertaining. The shops are mostly high in shops but it is very crowded over the weekend. Try going during the week.,alemk001
50,Fun place,"Very family friendly place to hang out and enjoy some sun. It doesn't get overly crowded by the pier where I would recommend to set up shop. There are good easy places to eat near the pier as well, though the food is expensive in the direct vicinity since they take advantage of the tourist trap concept. The waves also get a bit big so be careful if you're not a good swimmer or have young kids, and can be a tough place to learn to surf as well if you want to take care of that SoCal surf itch. The restaurant at Shutters that happens to be fairly close to the area near the pier is a good spot to eat and is nice but also casual with it being just off the beach. I would say it is a nice walk/bike ride along the path along the beach. You can easily stroll along and see the various health and fitness spaces set up, with this being a theme that is cool and something you can indulge in if you like.",clrinaldi43
30,Nice Beach,"Nice beach, pretty crowded, but the views are really nice. The waves were rough when were there, but nothing to drastic.",Claudia T
50,Gorgeous Beach,Loved this area! We hired bikes it was so relaxing and a brilliant way to see the sights and get around a lot faster.,Shel87
50,Beautiful!,"The beaches here are a bit crowded, but they're beautiful and clean. My kids loved getting a taste of the Pacific (as they're used to the southern beaches), and the area is quaint and laid back if you're looking to spend the day.",SouthernMama2
40,A lovely beach to take a walk,"While you are in LA, it's quiet lovely to take a walk here, the beach is sandy, it gets really windy so bring a jacket with you if you are here not in the middle of a hot day of summer. Anyway, the beach has more of a park than a beach vibe to it. If you are looking for a place to relax, sunbath, swim the ocean - this is not a place for you.",anaismalli
40,Beautiful White Sand - Lot's of homeless people!,This is a beautiful white sand beach. The first day it was really clean and not too crowded where we were. The second day there was more trash and seaweed. Our kids had a great time on the boogey boards. We were nowhere near the bathrooms or restaurants. Our biggest issue was the guilt seeing all of the homeless people. I wish there was something the city could do to help them. There were basically homeless communities that were everywhere we went.,JenniferJ45150
30,Too crowded for me,"I guess that's because I'm more into the secluded beach rather than the mainstream one. But you definitely can get the Californian beach experience you dreamed of here. Also, there is a pier next to the beach where you can buy your missing sun block or towel.",Rizki Dwi K
40,Fun times,We enjoyed walking the pier and then renting bikes for a ride to Venice. Easy ride (20 min). Everyone enjoyed the ride. Stop in between Santa Monica and Venice to watch the skate boarders at the skate park. They are awesome.,David F
40,Night was sketchy,Took 2 teenagers to pier and didn't feel very comfortable. Would not recommend being there late. We did eat and watch sun set at Lobsters which was great!!,Payhay
30,Not what I was expecting,"It's a beach. I thought I'd be more impressed since I've read so many wonderful things about it. But it's an average beach. There was a lot of guys walking around constantly try to sell me umbrellas, towels, sand toys, and boogie boards. That got annoying real quick. The pier is what is cool about this beach. If you're looking to visit the pier I'd recommend coming here. If you just want to visit the beach I'd go the short distance down to Venice beach. It seemed less crowded.",DAWN H
40,Wide nice beach,"I dont think I have ever seen a beach as wide as Santa Monica beach. The beach is clean, the water clear, the atmosphere is very nice... I learned Surfing here :)",Christina G
50,The pier and seaside,What a wonderful place. From the entertainment and rides on the pier to the picturesque views and beaches. This is a place to visit. There was parking on the beach but we did not have a car so could not give you a price. Really recommended.,LoveEatingOut6
50,Must go - Not the best beach in LA,"If you are debating what beach is the nicest to go to it is not Santa Monica, rather choose Huntington or Manhattan.However, this is a must see attraction. Whether it is the pier or the beach Santa Monica Beach is one of LAs premiers attractions. Between the ocean and the restaurants it is a great place to spend a day at!",AlexBTraveler
40,Buzzing excited atmosphere,"We visited Santa Monica Beach on 7 July. It was very hot that day but the funfair was great and the area just had a lovely buzz about it. Great wee shops on the pier and purchased a few wee souvenirs. There was a wedding taking place on the beach that day, which was lovely to watch. It is very busy with visitors & tourists but there is plenty of parking at the beach but like everything in America, you have to pay for it!!",Lagmorelass
50,nice beach,"nice beach close to the santa monica pier, easy parking, good sand, good sea, many life guards, nice california beach",Olivier P
50,Great pier to flips Santa Monica Beach is more than just a play in the sand.,"The Santa Monica Beach is just a 45 minute train ride from downtown Los Angeles hustle and bustling business and art district. The new light rail drops you off less than 200 yards away from the infamous 3rd Street promenade and only 50 more yards away from teh Santa Monica Pier that gives your inner child roller coasters to gymnastics fitness on the beach. It is a must see for children to safely enjoy their time on the beach and for adults to mingle and shop. Feeling a little energetic, you can walk, rent a green bike, hire a bike taxi to the famous Venice Beach skate park only 1 mile North along the beautiful volley ball courts that run parallel to the beach only a few hundred feet away. Or do what I do, take off your shoes and walk in the sand as the water cools your feet.",urbanbeagle
30,A very long and average beach,"The beach has very good sand, it is very long (a few miles length) but it is very wavy. Not very suitable for small children.",AntoNic7
40,Huge Beach!,"This is one of the widest beaches I think I've ever seen! The beach itself is very clean and the water wasn't too bad. There were lots of people out there swimming and enjoying the summer sunshine, however the beach car park at the base of the Santa Monica Pier fills fast so get there early if coming by car.And make sure you bring some thongs (flip flops) or footwear on a warm day because that long walk across the hot sand will be hard to do barefoot!",JoanneFromPerth
40,Quick trip to the beach,"We were in town for a family event and had some time to kill the day we arrived so we headed to the beach. We were only there for a couple hours, but had a great time playing in the waves. Parking is difficult, but par for the course in LA. and there were plenty of other people walking down with us. We had no trouble finding a bare spot for us to hang out, and had a nice couple hours.",Dan M
30,Crowds,This beach was very crowded both times that we visited. I was surprised at how much trash and other things that were strewn about. I was also surprised with a police presence on the pier and around the area exactly how much drugs were being done and passed and that is truly sad for me with how many families were there with young children even late into the evening and night. I also say a lot of homeless people who where going through the trash etc. They also could be very rude and crude if they overheard peoples conversations about something and they were not afraid to say it loud enough for you to hear.Parking is interesting to find even with paid parking lots. And the spaces are very tight if you are able to get in one of the lots. Be prepared for the $12 parking right at the pier itself if you don't want to have to walk really far. But even the $8 and $10 lots were crowded. It did not matter where you went on this beach it was crowded. You could be away from the pier in one of the $8 lots and that part of the beach was packed. I know it is summer and that is how the beach is but it surprised me to see people sitting literally next to strangers with really no room to get through.I will say that the lifeguards at this beach are very attentive and on top of things. We saw them in action because of medical issues. I was very impressed with their training and the way they handle situations but that is about the only good that I really saw .,Veronica B
50,Beautiful beach!,"The beach and boardwalk at Santa Monica were great! The beach is expansive giving plenty of room to the crowds we encountered on Memorial Day weekend. The boardwalk offered great restaurants, friendly vendors and restrooms. The restrooms are about as terrifying as a public restroom can be but serve the purpose when necessary. We did not ride any of the rides but it looked like lots of fun!",Tara T
40,So Much Fun,"Great beach to spend the day at. Lot's to do with Boardwalk, restaurants, volleyball, bike rides,etc. Usually lots of people but never too crowded to find room to spread out your blankets or towels. Lots of restaurants nearby for lunch or dinner and great shopping. Our favorite beach in LA (tied with Hermosa)",SaulG

40,Great walking area,"Good place for a stroll, people watch.listen to street buskers, bike ride.plenty of eaterys along the way. Great holiday vibe as you walk from pier down to venice beach or further.",Mike E
40,Cool,"Santa Monica Beach is a very cool beach but its really not the best beach, all-in-all, in the area. Check out Manhattan or Hermosa for more ""fun"" people and shopping. But, the Bayside Hotel IS a great place to stay there. My wife & I stayed there, at a good rate, for two nights and it was exactly what we needed. Everyone there was super nice & helpful!",Aaron Jay
50,Fun times,Such a beautiful place! Lots of fun can be had here. I travel to LA every three months & always try to get here! You can't help but have fun.,tammynicola
50,BEAUTIFUL Beach and lots to see,When i arrived at Santa Monica Beach we walked along the pier and checked out the ocean lots to do and see at this place there is a great shopping centre down the road and lots of great restaurants plus you have the markets and yoga on the beach we stayed across the road from the pier at the hotel/resort was so great for walking everywhere would love to go back again love it here.,Cathy W
40,A beach with options,"This is a beach with something for everyone. There are swings, exercise machines and other sporting actives. There is a bike path, a walking path. A very popular place for tourists and locals. Lots of people just sitting or lying on the sand enjoying relaxing or watching the waves. There were plenty of people swimming and life savers on patrol. It pays to note though that there are certain parts of the beach where you can't swim due to outlet pipes going into the water and causing pollution and health risks.",Janice L
50,So beautiful experience,We loved the beach and the walk on the 3rd street at Santa Monica area. I highly recommend to visit that area and the weather was amazing at sunset,Nidal S
40,Great Beach Volleyball COurts,"If you are a volleyball player on the Westside of LA, the Santa Monica beaches are the place to come. The nets are generally in good shape and the right height. If you are a decent player adn don't know peopl, you may be able to join a pickup game, but be careful because most people don't want to play with very inexperienced players. If you hvae lived int he area for a while you make make friends with people who come early and claim a good court for the day. If you want a good court on one of the prime playing beaches such as Sorrento near the Jonathan Club, you must arrive by 7 or 8 a.m. I'm a native Los Angelino and I almost never go in the water, though....too cold and possibly polluted.",Melissa D
30,Pretty beach but I have seen prettier,I visited Venice and Santa Monica. I choose Santa Monica over Venice due to the pier. The beach it self is cleaner also. Both nice beaches.,Dallasgurl10

30,"Lovely Views, better beaches to go to",Glad that we came and saw Santa Monica once (traveling with three teens). The teens enjoyed the rides and the pier performers. The beach looked beautiful and many people were on the beach. Strong currents and big waves. There are more picturesque beaches to visit in California.,Connie F
50,Great place to visit,First thing to know is that the beach sand is super soft and the water is not too cold which makes it a great place to visit. Second is that if you love collecting shells that this is a great beach for you.,love2beme
30,OK place to people watch,"Lots of activity on and off the beach: biking, skateboarding, volleyball and jogging.Main Street has a bunch of cool shops and eateries.",eclmom47
50,Pier was awesome,The beach was gorgeous and we ended up walk most of it because of where we parked. There was a large amount of homeless people but they stuck to one spot and didn't bother anyone. Highly recommend the Santa Monica Pier. We will definitely be going back. Fun little shops and eat at Pier Burger. My burger was great and my wife loved her chicken sandwich. If that's not your thing there is a Bubba Gump Shrimp right next door. Definite must see when visiting the area.,Matthew M

50,Don't forget the beach butler!,"Had a great experience because the beach butler made it very pleasant. My family and I had an umbrella, chairs, towels, igloo filled with drinks, and sand toys for my kids to play. The beach butler made everything happen, I didn't have to worry about bringing anything. The view was gorgeous! Definitely coming back. Thanks Sheldon!",AndyNgeena V
40,Beach and scenery!,"If you are there for food there are only the burger place, Japdog stand and 2 restraunt that is good every other place is souvenir stores. The fair has regular fair foods and one half size arcade. The pier is a nice walk and the beach is always beautiful. You may see baby sharks coming close to shore and dolphins close by. The scenery is always beautiful. I recommend going down to LA Jolla Cove and Imperial Beach though its a drive its worth it.",Road705563
40,Lovely beach once you finally get there!,We stayed at the Georgian Hotel and our room had a spectacular view of the pier and beach. From our window it looked quite close ...... don't be fooled! You have to go down a steep flight of steps and then over a bridge across the very busy highway to reach the beach. Once you are there the beach is lovely and very pleasant to walk along. We tried to walk to Malibu but the path stopped part-way there so we couldn't get any further on foot .... next time we'll take the bus! There is a very cheap shuttle bus that runs along the back of the beach .... just look out for the bus stops.,MikeandWendy01

30,Overrated,We came here expecting this to be the highlight of our trip. We were a little disappointed. There were so many people we could barely got a picture in. We had to wait over an hour just to pay for parking. It might be better on a quieter day but I would stay far away on any Saturday or Sunday. We enjoyed Zuma beach and Venice beach much more.,Jacob M
40,Large,Santa Monica Beach is amazingly wide. There is parking near the pier and more as you travel down the Pacific Hwy. A very clean beach.,deborah r
40,Great west coast beach to visit,If youve never been to the Pacific Ocean and you dont mind alot of people on a big beach this is the stop for you. Closer to the pier they actually have some people selling beach swag items. There is a big area for beach volleyball even a cement path in the middle of the beach down a ways from the pier to go skating or bike riding. This beach is usually kept clean and has been seen in shows and movies through the years. Im not saying you will see anyone famous but you will see alot of people and get a nice tan in the warm California sun.,Jedimasterkush

40,Beautiful beach,This is a beautiful beach. Probably the deepest/widest one I've ever seem in terms of the amount of sand you travel on before reaching the water.Parking was $12 and I saw now other parking options.The restrooms were clean. There were people walking along the beach selling umbrellas and fruit and other things. Not aggressive so we didn't mind.We stopped here to eat a picnic lunch and the sun is intense. Not sure why but our group ended up with light burns after the brief visit. So slather on the sunscreen.,CAworktravels

10,Santa Monica Beach,The beach was horrible it was absolutely a mess. There was trash everywhere you couldn't avoid it. You would think that sense it is such a big tourist attraction people would actually want to take care of the beach but they don't. If you think that the farther you walk down the beach the less trash there will be you are wrong you literally cant escape the trash. Don't go this far north stick with the beaches closer to Laguna and Newport.,phosford10

40,Wonderful place for adult and Kids to spend a day on the sea.,"Had a nice time with family here. The view is amazing, exactly what you can expect from California, especially the land escape. The beach is massive with many attrition and wonderful food outlets along the pier.I recommend that you plan to spend all day rather then half day to really take the full advantage of the place. If driving, you can park for $10 all day in car park very close to the beach. You can go just for a walk, swim, drink, eat, drive along the beach.Don't be surprised to see a few homeless sleeping around the beach though...... It is worth seeing.",BlaiseMakaza
50,Relaxing Day,"Santa Monica is fabulous. The pier consists of a small aquarium of local sealife. There are various street performers, eaters, an arcade and rides. Good family fun.",Leslie E

50,The beach for everybody,"This is one of the focal points of SM. Even if the sand was imported from the California desert, it feels like it as always been here. There is ample space north or south of the pier. The sun is always sunny except in June,(f the marine layer is known as June gloom. But the sun will return in the afternoon.",Bibi F
40,Crowded but fun,"While this beach doesn't compare at all to famous Hawaiian ones, it has its own personality. You can buy fresh mango and watermelon from the vendors pacing the shore and, while it does get crowded, it isn't impossible to find a spot. The beach offers good views of the sunsets of you're there at the right time.",Katie R
40,Fun Beach & Atmosphere,We stopped at the Santa Monica Pier and Beach on our anniversary trip. I went swimming even though the pacific water is pretty cold.

50,Santa Monica Pier,Fun place to visit. Walk along the beach and lots of different shops. Carnival games for kids and lots of stuff to eat!,Patti SB
40,Beautiful Beach with problems,The Santa Monica beach was the last stop on our trip.

40,With all the crowds still great,"Ocean ave. And the view of the beach and ocean will always be a must see. Just beautiful. Lots of people, cars tourists but it all works if u love great food stores beach attractions hotels and mostly clean and buttoned up. There are some pockets that have issues and tge city should require that homeowners and apt buildings maintain their grassy areas to a standard.",Irvinggetthecar
30,"Busy beach, beautiful ocean and sand","This beach is busy, but the ocean and the sand are beautiful. We did not swim, so I have no tips for bathrooms, showers, etc. The pier is nearby and there is food (smelled like a good restaurant on the pier) and the amusement park on the pier (free admission to park, but must pay for rides). This beach was nicer than Venice in our opinion. The surroundings and amenities are nicer.",Lollie777
40,Not Very Impressed,Went here on for the day and not very impressed.It looks tired and hardly anyone around.It looks good on the net but when you get there forget it.The beach is nice but lots of homeless people around.I would not go again.,Stephen F
40,Nice day at the beach,"The day we visited it was cool and somewhat smoggy, but the beach itself is very wide making it seem not as crowded. There is a bike path and public restrooms, although they close at dark. There were some great food trucks parked on the road the day that we went and we ate at one of them. All in all it was a pleasant day and we would do it again.",tincognito
50,Wow,Pretty beach and super fun pier. We had a great time getting out caricature done and getting our fortune from zoltar.,megan s
40,Vacation,"Nice beach, too cold for use to enjoy during our visit. Large number of homeless persons laying in various locations as well as wondering around the beach area. Some were obviously mentally ill and/or under the influence of drugs. Smell of marijuana was THICK on the boardwalk area.",Db323

50,A wonderful beachfront,Saw the place as a part of the organized tour so did not get much time to hang around but the spot is good for beach lovers and kids alike as there's an amusement park too. The promenade is good for cycling and joggers too. The sand is clean and maintenance is done regularly for kids to play with.,bipsav
40,Really clean and a great beach.,The reviews about the beach being dirty- we didn't see anything but a great clean beach with loads of people participating in various activities having a great time. This is a great spot to just sit and people watch. Well worth a visit.,Ianbb8
40,A great place to spend a day!,This is a lovely town to spend a day. There is the fun of a fair on the Pier...the Promenade is full of super stores...and Venice Beach is just a short walk away. Loads of good cafés and resturants. Can be crowded but interesting and entertaining cosmopolitan town worth visiting. You can Uber..but if your coming from a longer distance don't Uber Pool. Be sure to wear a hat...sunscreen and bring lotsa water in the summer.,tereza09
50,Cant beat the beauty,Excellent time with my daughter on the Santa Monica beach. Always sunny and beautiful. Great place to people watch or hit the ocean.,BReal549
10,This beach is so dirty,I honestly felt very uncomfortable here. We even found a dirty pad floating in the water. The people at least were very nice. Every time my husband and I visit a new location we always try their beach I can honestly say this is the dirtiest one we've ever seen.,Jacquelyn W
30,Homeless people,This was our first California beach experience. There were homeless people on the beach. When you go to the pier their are musicians begging for your money. I noticed some trash in the sand. In my opinion it was ok. Seen prettier views around Laguna and Newport.,chubee01
30,Decent enough beach,It was an okay beach. We passed up the pier which we regret but we had already paid for parking so we weren't going to walk all the way down the beach to get there. It's not much to say about this beach though. There's nothing negative to share but the restroom facilities were clean.,Sthompson77
30,"Homeless ,more homeless and a beach","If you're looking to actually go to the beach , go south a few miles to Venice or walk (or) ride Bikes which would be good during the week but on the weekends it's gridlock like the freeway at 5:00... except more dangerous. Keep your kids off the bike path!Get away from the insanity of the SM Pier.Otherwise you can look... but stay out of the D rated water. Certainly don't eat fish from fisherman anywhere around the Pier. Go up to Will Rogers state Beach which is clean and less crowded.",Richard S

40,Beautiful Southern California Beach!,"Santa Monica Beach is a beautiful, large beach with lots of parking for easy access (except on Memorial Day)! It was worth fighting the traffic and finding a parking place to see the moving Memorial Day tribute of numerous red and white crosses adorning the beach. Santa Monice Beach has a large expanse of white sand on both sides of the Santa Monica Pier and it can accommodate a large number of sun worshipers! The ocean, beach, water sports, pier entertainment, food and shopping - it doesn't get any better than this! SoCal fun at its best!",MKTBE
50,One of the greatest beaches in the world.,"I love the beach, it's one of my favorite beaches in the world. Such great people watching.

40,Tourist meca,Visited Santa Monica on a cold mid week day and hired bikes for an hour to cruise the beach. Nice area but overcrowded with tourists.,Rachel J
50,Had no idea it was this big,"What a lovely big clean groomed beach. There was plenty of room, a paved path for walking or biking, and outdoor exercise equipment. I saw two parking lots, one for just 2 hours and another for longer stays. The only negative was some work being done to what smelled like a sewer.",Sue2000
20,Uninspiring beach,Good to walk along and the surf looks good but it's not the best beach in the world / most aesthetically pleasing beach on the planet.,westcountryphotography
40,great beach,"lovely long and sandy beach so no problem finding somewhere to lay out , car parking can be a problem at weekends but that's to be expected , only down side is starting to see more and more homeless people but that's the same with all California beaches , they don't bother you so not a big deal",Ben H

50,"Exciting, and very Beautiful","When we arrived at the beach it was already pumping with fun and excitement. The beach is very clean, but although the water was too cold amidst a beautiful sunny day...we enjoyed it to the fullest. Lots of people kept coming and coming...which added to the excitement. It is a fun beach, and great for a tan (which we got). Beautiful mountains surround it.",Sandy_Salsa

30,Nice seaview,"There's a run down amusement park at the beach which gives it a vintage vibe and adds some character to the place. Love the cool sea breeze. Lots of tourist shops selling souvenirs with the Route 66 keychains and magnets.Interesting experience on finding toilet/washroom. The ones at the beach were smellly and crowded. We decided to visit the hotels across the street. As these are high end hotels, most of the toilets were locked from public use. Thankfully we found one hotel who allowed us to use their toilet. :)",Megan Chow A
30,Breath taking,"Amazing things to see, so clean so relaxing loved it!!! I recommend it for everyone, even small children!",Mantachie96

50,Live the Baywatch way!,"Santa Monica beach. Known from the Baywatch series and lots of films. The beach itself is big and excellent with nice white sand. Except some waves and a bit chilly water, but so is the Pacific. The pier is always crowded, day and night.

That was an awesome experience.",Vidar S
40,Still great even on a cold day,"A must see when visiting LA. We went on a cold day however was still great to see. The pier is cute with market stalls, rides etc. lots of places to get food etc. Make sure you check out Muscle Beach while your down there for a laugh, lots of entertaining characters. There is also a walking path to Venice Beach, you can do bike hire as well if you like. Took us around 45 mins walking at a leisurely pace.",Shai B
50,Great escape for the day!,"The beach is in the shadow of the pier. The background of the hills surrounds the coastline a gives a feeling of being on an exotic island.It was rather chilly for the couple of days I was there, so there weren't many people on the beach or in the water. Nice for walking along the water line.Would go back during warmer weather.Parking is $15 for the day - not bad.",KuriousKat2
40,Nice beach full of lifeguards,"If the water was a little warmer I would give 5 stars, but hey that is nature. Cons: it is 9 bucks to park you want to be close to Will Rogers, but I think that is more convenient than being at the dock that is crowded.",Josué N
40,Relaxing time in the city,"Santa Monica Beach is probably one of the most famous beaches in the world, and it certainly lives up to its reputation.

It is easy to access, we got there using the subway and it is right down the street.The scenery is amazing, and there are some such good spots to take photos and just sit and watch the world go by.

40,Clean and pretty!,"Lovely beach, large enough that it is not crowded, lots of parking for reasonable rate. Perry's on the beach is a good place to eat. This beach is south of Santa Monica Pier and worth the trip to get away from the more touristy Pier. Lovely, soft sand.",Suz B

40,Big wide beach with lovely sand.,Very busy and dynamic beach area full of families having fun and lots of kites as was the kite festival.

50,Loved it,"We hit the beach to fulfill our desire to add another coast to our ""been there"" list. The rules are you have to at least wade so our entire party waded. Yes the waters are COLD. That was expected. We really enjoyed strolling up the beach catching some local color.",Sam M

40,Nice place to take in the scenery and enjoy a drink,Fun to just walk around the pier and enjoy people watching and the beautiful scenery. A must stop when in LA area.,Q4240KFpeterl
50,Beautiful. Period.,"One of the most beautiful beaches I have ever been to. I didn't even mind the crowds, they weren't too thick that you couldn't move around. The water is literally turquoise. The only improvement I could ask for is to have more benches on the pier facing the water; as soon as you spot an empty one and start to move towards it, someone else will beat you to the punch. The shore itself could use more juice shops. There are restaurants, but they sell coffee and hot dogs, not fruity tropical drinks with tiny umbrellas and delicious iciness. Tip: If you're not bringing a lot of beach bags/coolers/towels, park at Third Street Promenade and walk over. The garages there are super cheap and the walk down the shops & across the pedestrian bridge isn't too far.",intlV
30,Not as pretty as I though it would be...,Very average beach and doubt that anyone would swim there. Lots of sport activities around though if you are into that.,Eloygm
40,Nice day out,Went to Universal Studies than visited Santa Monica beach. It was fairly busy but a beautiful beach and pier. The beach was clean and not polluted like it the uk and I highly recommend visiting if you travel here.,DcVsMarvel

50,Sun and fun,It was nice to be able to enjoy the sun and beach without feeling hot. Very clean and beautiful. Not too many people were in the water and it was a little rougher than I would be comfortable with.,AAFA86
40,LA Beaches,"Nice beach in LA, however I believe Orange County and San Diego beaches are superior. All in all, being so close to a major city, Santa Monica certainly gets the job done. There are a large amount of people and tourists gathered near and around the Pier, so if you're looking for more relaxed beach time, possibly steer clear from there.",Andrew

50,Lovely Slice of life,"It sure was a great way to pass an afternoon soaking the CA sunshine. It is an excellent place to people watch - every sort, kind, race, religion, whatever floats your boat. Watched and was mesmerized by the skateboarders at the skate park. Good for families, couples. Be aware of random bikers, skateboarders, runners, walkers, etc.",MamanNY
40,Nice area,We went down here on a Wednesday afternoon. It was a nice clean beach. There was a sign that said the water was dangerous due to bacteria so that was pretty gross. I would have given it 5 stars if there was a place to rinse our feet afterwards. The water wasn't turned on.,Krista M

40,Beautiful,We were there on a busy Sunday. The pier was busy but we could walk around and see everything. But the beach was beautiful. It is huge and easy to find a hood spot. Things to see are the pier with carnival rides and food. Muscle beach. And the sand and sea.,Kevin L
50,Enjoyable!,Sand was a bit hot and the ocean chilly but since we just wanted some relaxing beach time it was great. It does require a long walk in the sand to the shore so as long as you have shoes you're good.,Ruth E
30,Fun Visit,"I only gave it 3 stars instead of 4 or 5 because I was amazed at all the trash left behind on our visit. My daughter & I collected a paper bag and left over Mac & cheese that was causing the seagulls to go into a frenzy. We also collected an empty chip bag, plastic water bottle, piece of glass, newspaper. We disposed of all of it close by. Very touristy afternoon but sad people did not pick up after themselves.My 11 year old loves the beach & despite the frigid Temp's of the water she was in it for almost 45 mins. We had a nice visit to the Pacific before flying back to late season snow in Denver.",momof2wildchilds

40,"Huge beach, clean waters","The beach was clean but crowded on a weekday afternoon in April. The water felt cold at first but we soon acclimatised and were happily splashing waist-deep in safe (I hoped) shallows. Underfoot is nice smooth sand.It's a huge beach and the crashing waves of the Pacific are beautiful, but it's a little featureless - I'd rank it way above, say, Weston-Super-Mare beach in the UK, but way below the beautiful beaches of the Algarve.The pier is nearby for carnival-type fun, and there's playground equipment on the sands for both children and fitness-inclined adults.The sunsets here are famous and beautiful.",Merry H
50,One of the best sunset in the world.,"Had already been to Santa Monica on my first day but decided to go back once more for one last sunset before leaving, especially after reading that sunset in Santa Monica is considered one of the top 20 in the world.

Going there it's a must!,Saltaplayas

50,One Of The Best Beaches IN So Cal,"Santa Monica Beach oh how I love love love you!!! This past weekend I had the pleasure of visiting for the umpteenth time! My cousin was visiting from Nashville, TN and had never been to California! Of course I am bringing her here! Aside from being a tourist trap this beach is one of the BEST you can find in southern California! The vibes here are amazing and if you are into working out at the ""Muscle Beach"" then look no further. You won't be the only one who is down for doing some crazy workouts on the playground looking equipment they offer. Get your gymnastics on or hell even some random yoga! Oh and speaking on playgrounds, they do have a few for the little kiddies! Being the kid at heart I am I had to hop on the swing and do one of those numbers where you swing high and jump off (silly I know). They also offer a boardwalk with a ton of different fattening food but who is counting calories? The infamous Ferris Wheel is worth getting on just for the experience so definitely try that out. If you are thinking of taking dive in the water please keep in mind this is the pacific ocean and it is FREEZING depending on the time frame you visit. Parking is atrocious so UBER on down or pay a big ticket to park on the boardwalk.",BugattiBoi88

If you use the beach closest to the pier you will have restrooms close by and plenty of parking. The waves did not seem high enough for surfing. Swimmers can wade out quite a long way and still be in waist deep waters. Great place for family fun. No alcohol is allowed on the beach.,Dale R
50,Great beach,"Santa Monica beach is awesome, wider than a lot of beaches are long! His meant that it didn't feel too crowded. We parked at the shopping centre that is a two minute walk to the beach. Was far cheaper than parking on the beachfront or pier. Other benefit is close by to shops and restaurants.

50,Beautiful,Santa Monica beach is gorgeous. It's huge so quite a walk from the street to the ocean but that also means there's lots of space and you can have a big spot to yourself.

40,Nice place to take a stroll,Clean beach with quite a few facilities for outdoor activities. Great place for families to head out too.Kids have sandpits areas to go crazy in. A few nice places to eat and have a drink. The pier makes for a good photo oppurtunity,PrasanjitKumar

40,Nicer than Venice!,"If you are walking the boardwalk then the chances are you either come from or are going to Venice.Santa Monica is much nicer than Venice, with fewer cheap shirt shops and more of the beach being used for volley ball or football games.It's about 1 1/2 miles from one end to the other so a nice walk if you've got the time although it does get busy",peppermint

50,Go for a swim,"Stay away from the pier, bring a beach towel, and take a swim.I got there by train, wore my flip flops in the water, and dried off walking back to the train. I was so shocked that the beach was largely clear and clean, and no one was swimming, that I spontaneously jumped in for a long, enjoyable swim. I loved it.There are few benches on the beach, and the path to the Pier is always crowded.",daviddD3505IR

40,Better than expected and really fun,"Went there just to see the pier but found that it was really cool. Lots of street performers and some really good ones too. Ate at the restaurant at the end, Marisols. Food was much better than expected and the street performer playing the ukulele was awesome to listen to while eating outside. It's has a ""fair"" feel in the good way. We even got funnel cake. I'd go back we enjoyed it so much.",Richard R
50,Wonderful place!,"I grew up in a state with the Rocky Mountains so I'm not a beach girl, but this beach was BEAUTIFUL. They kept it clean, and had plenty of vendors for food and items.

The shopping area was a nice alternative.",Eve212015

There are chess games to be played, beach volleyball nets to volley over, a tumbling or acro-yoga area, and so much more. In addition, the beach has expansive grassy park areas, if getting sandy isn't your thing. You can picnic or layout to your heart's content, before grabbing a healthy, organic lunch at any one of the Perry's snack shops...

It's got a very interesting and varied atmosphere, there's always something to do and the folks are very friendly. If you want to eat, there's so much choice and from my experience anything is worth getting. Walking the pier and night is a must as well, it's one of those cultural experiences that is fun and memorable. I especially enjoy walking right to the end and then pointing out to the Pacific and saying: ""I can't see my house from here, but it's eleven thousand miles that way."" Trust me - it's hilarious, everybody just cracks up, gives me high fives and asks for my autograph.",Mat

40,A little chilly day,Great day on the beach. It was fairly cold today however it was nice and relaxing coming from a city that still has a couple feet of snow on the ground.,Mdecker17
50,Atmospheric and filming on beach,Loved going underneath the pier and paddling. They were filming Lucifer whilst we were there. I got told off for taking a photo. It made it more exciting,Safari606660
50,Beautiful and Well Kept,"From the pier, my wife and I only explored one side of the beach leading down to Venice Beach. The area was beautifully maintained with ample space for people, cyclist, skateboarders, and pedestrians walking. Likely one of the nicer beaches you will experience in the United States.",xScience
50,Wow,Great evening out.Parking next to pier and $5Rides and food reasonably priced.Great evening out on a pleasant clear night.,RichChichLet
50,"Huge beach, dramatic approach to the Pacific","Acres of sand, packed relatively flat. Misty and cold on a March afternoon but very beautiful. Old, old plants survive on the edge. Lots of people - tourists and residents and first responders and vendors.",L C L
50,Gorgeous,Beautiful Californian beach - recommend walking straight through to Venice Beach for a perfect afternoon,Emmaonholiday_89
50,Awesome Bike Ride,"The bike path goes from Marina Del Ray, through Venice and Santa Monica, all the way up to Malibu. My husband and I did the entire route up and back and it was the best thing we did while in LA. Beautiful sceneries and really enjoyable. The Santa Monica beach is really nice as well.",Maria C
20,Would skip,We went on a very foggy day. There was not apt to do or view. We walked around and observed others. Would spend time elsewhere.,Tcdish
30,Planned a night to see pier and the promenade,"Lost my excitement due to the fog that was so thick I couldn't see even a ride:(( so we ventured over to the promenade of shops and restaurants that was very cool! Kids loved the store, I loved the food! Only problem was on a Saturday night , the shops closed early :( lush store is small but has all the best of there products. There was street entertainment as such as Venice but not as risky. March is very busy time to be there extremely packed. But that may be all months.",Dr. Riggs
30,February is not the best time to go,"We went on a weekday of February. So you can imagine it was almost empty. For me, it is interesting to know that Baywatch was filmed here, but my kids did know about that series. I have heard that in the weekends and on July and August is very crowded",Marco C
50,Perfect for morning walk or jog.,"How could you miss this? Gorgeous in good weather, friendly Californians, and the historic end of Route 66!",brownestonea
50,Super long beach perfect for a run either in the sand or on sidewalk,"Very nice beach, and really clean, it spreads over a large distance so it's great for getting some morning exercise either running on the sand, or taking advantage of the wide sidewalk, which also allows cycling. During the morning there are less people walking around so if trying to avoid crowds early mornings are the best.",MirelaBCN
50,Glad we went!,"Beautiful spot! Lots of little buskers(if that's what you call them) magicians painters like a little market as well. Beautiful view people fishing off the pier, arcades. Little expensive for the rides but hey it's a fair at a beach on a pier! How cool!",Shawna B
40,Enjoyable visit but not spectacular,"Enjoyed my visit to Santa Monica and spent a pleasant day wandering around the beach, pier and mall area. I was there on a cloudy, overcast day and this certainly impacted the view and the mood. However, contrary to other reviews this is a pleasant beach but it's certainly not outstanding. I've seen many more scenic beaches elsewhere, especially inin Australia, Thailand and the Philippines.",Cas S
50,Full of life,The feeing u get there is like sea is giving energy to all life there. You can have bicycles boards etc on rent. Many people were jogging on the tracks. Water is also clean and u can have breakfast. Shopping also cross the lane.It was fun being there.,anubhav73
40,Beautiful Beach especially wonderful sunset sets,"We have visited Santa Monica Beach several times. On our last visit we were lucky to stay at Shutters on the Beach. Our room had a view on the Santa Monica Beach. We walked along the beach for a mile in each direction. It's a great beach and is especially nice at sunset. There are lots of activities like volleyball, exercise classes, and various water sports.",winofoodtravel
50,Full of life!,"It's such a vibrant beach, many people and restaurants! We came in September so the weather was warm. I enjoyed looking at the beach, as far as the eyes can see. There were also expensive beach houses nearby! I bought my stylish cowboy/girl hat and beach slippers here!",TAROTZAMM

50,Really Nice Beach,I'm not sure I've ever been on a larger beach. It's a long span from the parking lot/walking area to the waterline. Lots of space to relax and spread out. facilities and restaurants not far away! And you won't be on top of other people. Worth spending a day here.,eluper
50,"Nice, Cool, Mellow","The mood is laid-back and hip. You see things on this beach that you do not see elsewhere. Acrobatics, gymnastics, aerobics, martial arts, and tanning in freezing weather. Everyone is so nice. Smiling faces and politeness are always a plus. America the way is should be!",PenmanUk
50,Warm Sands,"Santa Monica Beach, what can one say, Big, Beautiful, Clean, you can find a place just to relax without a lot of disturbance ,it is very peaceful, and great place to watch the Dolphins and to experience nature at its best",medgoldie

50,I won a race. A real running race.,"It's quite possible. No. Highly possible, that Santa Monica Beach will be the location of the ONLY running race I will ever win.I was in LA for work for just over a day and as always insist on staying by the beach.I'd entered a 10k race organised by a team called 'A Better Running World'. With jet lag in my legs the last thing I expected was to win. But I did.I loved this beach anyway. But now, its become even more special.Running by the sea is always a treat. And it doesnt get any better than Santa Monica.",major_rawls
30,Probably above average in season but was meh in the off season,"A little more ""drifters"" than I felt comfortable with...some of them got a little hostile and aggressive with imaginary people...akin to what you'd see downtown San Francisco. It was clear that Muscle Beach was exactly what it said...a place for locals (of all shapes! lol) to workout. The Bike Trail and walking trail was great...I preferred the trail/beach as I biked closer to Venice Beach...that's probably because I was away from most of the tourist traffic at Santa Monica Pier!! I felt safe most of the time but I'm not walking/biking at night unless I'm remotely close to the police station that was on the beach.",grothman
40,Great Beach,Let me preface this by saying the only thing keeping me from giving the beach four stars is walking through a lot of homeless people from the main Santa Monica area to the beach. Once their it's authentic California. Aspiring musicians are everywhere and sometimes it's nice just to sit and listen. The beach is so massive that you can always find a quiet area to sit and watch the waves or people. Must do: Stay for the sunset. It's the best I've seen (other than maybe Hawaii),celtics323
50,Brilliant Escape,"Needs all day for the beach, downtown as well plus the pier also. Something that is great in the sunny weather.What makes even better is the recently opened Expo line to downtown L.A so only hour from city centre.Keep on coming.",Rosie P

50,Stunning,Santa Monica beach is one of the best in the country. The wide expanse of sand and pretty boardwalk are awesome. It has a pier that extends quite a distance out into the Pacific with rides and other quitschy stores. The walking path goes on and on. Take a moment to step down onto this beach and then make your way across the street to the great Santa Monica shopping district. It is a great place to be. Highly recommended.,kzecb40
50,Unique world famous beach,"This Pacific Coast beach is simply breathtaking. There is a bike/walking path which runs along in between the sand and the PCH. (Pacific Coast Highway) I walked for 50 mins every morning and was reluctant to return to my hotel.You can walk from Venice Beach to Sunset Blvd (and further if you wish) interrupted and in complete safety. I assure you your eyes will be everywhere! Please remember to take your bottle of water, sun bloc and hat along with you.",TheFlyingFrock
40,Santa Monica Beach: If you like it watch it as your eyesight,Love it in fog with a chill in the air and after the Municipal trucks have raked it smooth.

50,Awesome,"A must see for everyone visiting LA. I love the ocean and we enjoyed dipping our feet in the cold water as it was winter. Good thing, it was a sunny day when we were here and had a good view of the sunset. Had a good barefoot walk for half of the stretch of the shoreline till we get to the pier. Life is a beach!",prettylobster
30,Lots of sand,"Paved path for walking is nice but really far from the water and what's with the bikes only as you near the pier? Walkers are relegated to the uneven alley way.The beach is well groomed. On the Ventura side of the pier, the beach is much more park like and family friendly.",Rbj2040
50,So relaxing!,"Never did I expect that Santa Monica Beach would be so massive! My husband and I went out one morning and all I wanted to do was walk on the beach and collect sea glass. We walked for a bit and found quite a few pieces. I was disappointed that there were hardly any people out enjoying the weather and the waves. We did see some surfers, but otherwise the beach was quiet. It was so relaxing to walk along and find the sea glass. My favorite relaxing activity!",VEE1225

50,"So much to see, so little time","What a beach for people watching! Plus wide, empty, clean, soft sand. Visitors and locals alike enjoying outdoor activities. Bicycling, running, walking, roller skating, volleyball, suntanning, shooting the bull at Perry's. If I lived in Santa Monica, there would be no excuse for being out-of-shape. Easy to be healthy here.",Helen G

50,Lovely Beach,"I went in February, when most Californians seem to think the beach is much too cold. But if you're a tourist from a cold place like me (Chicago), 75 degrees is heaven in February, and I enjoyed myself on a not-so-crowded, beautiful beach, although I walked far from the pier to avoid the repeating music.Worth noting that on Sundays there are rows of crosses commemorating the deaths caused by recent wars, with extra mentions of Standing Rock and the number of military suicides a year. It's a powerful and sobering memorial between the pier and the beach, but I mention it mainly because I saw a lot of children being disrespectful while I was there, which is worth a mention for families moving from the pier onto the beach.",Leah v
30,Good for an afternoon at the beach,I was impressed with this beach as not longer was it clean but the mountain backdrop is quite impressive. We walked along the beach and admired the graffiti and the street dancer actsI would recommend for a day out .,tsvarakadenga

40,Heaving mass of humanity but still awesome,"I've been going here every year on our family vacation and always had a a really fun, peaceful time. Apparently everyone else has been, too, because last week it was insanely busy. The beach was packed, the pier was heaving, the roads leading to the beach and back to the parking in Santa Monica were reminiscent of leaving a concert. It was just all so busy! That said, we still had a great time. Where else do you get the beach, the pier, the park, the walking-friendly town and still be 20 minutes from the airport? It's a pretty spectacular spot. Stay for sunset if you can!",AlanaN1111
50,Walking,"There is a bike path and neat walkway right next to sand with a great view. It also connects to the pier where there are shops and restaurants. There are also outdoor concerts in the at times with well known performers. A merry go round, small roller.

50,Beautiful Beach. Must Visit!,"This is a beautiful beach where you can spend endless hours enjoying the sea and the breeze. The beach is clean and beautiful and has ample space to lie down and enjoy the tranquility. You will find lots of people here enjoying their time. It is a joy by itself to view people being lost in their own world on the shoreline. There are some cafes on the beach to unwind and enjoy a hut cuppa while listening to the seas. If you want some noise and buzz, head down to the pier which is a short walk away.Ample parking too is available at a nominal cost. Don’t miss this one if you are in Santa Monica.",shibinbalan
40,Clean and so much space,Love these beaches. I would recommend going North of the Pier as there are fewer crowds. Gently shelving beach means this is perfect for those with young children.,Dougie G
50,Tons to do,Santa Monica beach really is worth a visit with so much to see and do. There is lots of great restaurants and and you can spend hours walking enjoying the Californian lifestyle.,Jamie B
30,Deceptively cold water,The beach was nice and the sand trapped enough heat to warm your bare feet. Bring along a simple wine and cheeseboard picnic down with you and a Frisbee for a short reprieve from walking. Then rent a bike for an hour or two as a nice way to see the Santa Monica area beaches.,Nick R

50,Beach day!,It's so relaxing going to the beach. Santa Monica beach is no exception. We did yoga on the beach one morning and it was lovely. The only thing that I found strange about the beach is how many wheelie bins there were along in. Great for a visit.,Sarah C

50,Beautiful vast beach beach,"I went in May, so it wasn't hot enough yet and it was windy, but it is a very beautiful and vast sandy beach. There is lots to do, but mostly RELAX. Right by the iconic Santa Monica Pier so you're never too far from amenities. There are lots of homeless people, though. I was quite shocked to see them all there. They use the public toilets, so they can be quite unpleasant to use.",Violet M
40,Iconic Beach,"Wow, such an enormous beach, larger than life, it'll take you 20 mins to walk from the promenade to the water! You could easily spend all day here, it can be crowded but it's perfect for people watching, enjoying a gaze at the iconic pier and feeling that beautiful and clean sand between your toes. The mountains make a nice backdrop for pictures too. Walking from the pier to Venice beach will take ages by the way (doesn't look that far on the map)! It's a nice stroll and a nice beach.",Suzy M

The little life saver huts dotted along the beach were great for photos although they were unmanned at the time. Great view of the pier too.,Susan L
50,Chill,"Whether tourist or local, this beach never fails to amaze everyone. From bike rentals to Ferris Wheel, or restaurants and bars, you can spend a whole day exploring this beautiful LA spot. Great place to just walk around for hours and chill outdoors whether in the shade or basking in the sun. Great looking beach crowd and very safe.

40,Lovely beach with great water,"Doesn't it make a huge difference when the city council makes an effort to keep the beach clean and tidy. If only I could say the same of the UK. Santa Monica beach features bright sand, clear waters, and big waves. Just make sure that you stay out of the space reserved for the Baywatch as they might tell you off. The views in all directions are marvellous and worth taking pictures of. Santa Monica may be packed with tourists but there is still enough for you to find your own unique angle.",Shawn4Ever
50,Santa Monica Beach,"Simply put, iconic. I've lived in Los Angeles my entire 58 years. 24 of them have been in Santa Monica.It's beautiful, gloriously expansive, and it's location allows you to walk, from the beach, to restaurants andboutiques on Main Street, allowing you to leave your car in the parking lot, and save yourself traffic.

30,Ok,"Like many beaches at this time of year...quiet as we expected. It most certainly is a huge expanse of sand and at this time of year you can take a stroll without all the crowds. A beautiful beach, I don't think I would call it that. Having said that it does have a certain charm!",Kohinoor12

30,So many homeless people,Came at the peak of winter and there were almost as many homeless people as tourists.. Felt pretty unsafe at night but not knowing the area at all and seeing so many congregated homeless people will do that. Visit in the day it's ok you can watch people use the old muscle beach area some really fit talented people.,Christina
40,Lovely way to spend an early morning,"The path along Santa Monica Beach is easy to follow and spotted with little places to stop for a coffee/snack or even hire a bike/skates. We enjoyed seeing many popular spots from TV shows show around the area, the famous Route 66 sign and walking the Pier.It was peaceful, relaxing and a great way to spend an hour early in the morning. With more time, a jog or exercise along the beach or training at the famous Muscle Beach spot would be memorable.",busymumsydney
30,Nice beach with numerous activities,Santa Monica Beach is in the Santa Monica Bay. It is a very wide white sand beach with area of wooden walks. Although the rating is only average because the rating does not count other combinations. The beach has smaller waves than other ocean beach so good for family swim (I saw someone got in water with the winter cold temperature during my visit). Combine the walk on the beach to see sunset and the walk on the pier for other activities or dining give visitors memorable experiences.,Prawet J

40,Nice beach for summer,"Santa Monica is a great place to visit. It has lots of tourism, attractions and restaurants for all ages. You can walk along the border walk, rent a bicycle, do some skating, etc. There's also a small amusement park there. Recommended visit while in Los Angeles.",Javier C.
50,Great Place w/ Lots To Do!!!!,"BE CAREFUL about going on holidays. This place gets insanely crowded. I would recommend turning this visit into something longer than a day trip. There are a ton of things to do there and you will need quite a bit of time to do a fraction of those things. This place is great for families, kids, couples or anyone single.Go early if you can as well. Parking will be a major issue if you show up late on a holiday day/week (From my experience). You can also park farther away from the pier. Those parking spots are pretty far though. Make sure to take your camel pak and some dry food for your journey to the pier from there. Good luck and have fun.",Ivan O
40,Beach,Nice beach. That is all. I have seen the reason why it's so famous. Parking places have different prices so check before you drive into one of them.,Falconi66
50,Wonderful walk,"I went there using the bicycle track and it was just awesome! You have a sea view on all the way and the beach propose a skate park, and the famous muscle area were you can see people's doing incredible things.",Ulysse H
20,Disappointed,It is a bit chilly for a beach day but I wanted my kids to see the Pacific Ocean and get their picture. Unfortunately there is no where to park without paying more than is reasonable. The ugly fencing and run down parking areas detract from the view.,MemCer
40,"Wide beach, end of rte 66, stroll on the dock","In Southern California, this would be one of the places you have to check out, either to get some Route 66 memorabilia (young people won't know what that was), check out the weight lifters, sun yourself, or meander along the dock. It's peaceful and scenic. We stayed at someone's house just north of the dock and it was a fine view, a relaxing environment.Enjoy!",Kenpasha
50,Sunset over the ocean WOW,The beaches are huge and the views spectacular.We come from the bush in QLD too see the sun set over the ocean was. Just one word WOW,Al C
40,Lovely but a lot of homeless people.,Absolutely lovely beach. It was clean and nice. Grate views and there are dolphins off the coast you can just about see from the beach.The only sad thing was the amount of homeless people here. They were not rude or a problem but it's very sad to see and made me feel guilty for spending so much money on a holiday when they obviously have nothing. It did spoil it as we were not expecting to see so many homeless people.,Loulou01772
50,Great Beach.,This is great beach. Lots of things to do and some incredible food trucks. we really enjoyed the experience.,ej762016
50,Beautiful and clean!,"The beach here is large, clean, and picturesque. It was a great first visit to the Pacific ocean for us, even if it was in November. The views here are spectacular, of the mountains, the pier, and the city. I hope to make it there again one day when it is warmer!",Megan

40,Santa Monica beach,Car park on the beach was very busy and expensive would advise not to park there. We parked up on the Main Street in an overhead car park and only paid $4.75 for the day.Everything is easily got to in Santa Monica you can walk or cycle everywhere.Busy beach full of people with lovely views,Travelobsessed
40,Tight Rope Walkers and Cyclists Galore!,A really large beach but has a walking path so you don't have to get your shoes dirty. Saw a lot of people cycling along the beach as well as people working out at the outdoor gym. Some tightrope walkers practicing as well. So many bins along the beach and they were only 2m apart from each other. Bit excessive?,CTR15

40,Sunny Afternoon On The Pier,The day started out cloudy and overcast but ended up coming out sunny. Its a great place for a walk and plenty of photo opportunities in good weather. The games arcade is a let down and very old and tired looking and in need of a major makeover and new games machines. There are outdoor rides too which are pretty good including a Ferris wheel....expensive though. Had a great lunch at Bubba Gump Shrimp restaurant so make sure you go there!,Rachaelcreighan
50,Pacific ocean..the most attractive presence,"The beach on Pacific ocean in Santa Monica is really beautiful.The gentle slope to the ocean is very nice and our kids enjoyed a lot being there.Enjoyed walking bare foot,made sand castle and the unending waves.Highly recommended.",rockteam72
40,Just a walk,I always like going to Santa Monica when I stay in West Hollywood. I like to take Sunset even though it's a little bit curvy because it's a much prettier drive to the water.I like to walk along the water breathe the air and just enjoy being there,Jeremy T

Great little playground for young children",blanch02
40,Fabulous weather for November - beach was great to walk on,Arrived on holiday from UK to LA and headed straight to Santa Monica beach area. We park at the top and walk down to enjoy the vista and are never disappointed. There are plenty of toilet and shower facilites plus the opportunity to access the SM Pier (end of Route #66). It is a great place to eat your lunch and take in the sights of the beach. There is ample parking and advice is park a little distance from the pier to enjoy a walk.,KEVIN R
50,Just fun,"Santa Monica Pier and beach is a fun and manageable experience that is not disappointing at all. Just staring at the vast Pacific with mountainous backdrops is impressive enough. The beach is wide and clean. The Pier itself with its ancient wood and vintage signage and attractions, offers great people watching, deliciously unhealthy food stands and restaurants, a vintage theme park with delightfully low tech rides or just fishing, which can be a zen experience. Parking (on a wooden parking lot!) is inexpensive and the bathrooms were quite clean.",FlyMeT0TheMoon

50,Iconic Southern California,"It's all here: the crowds, the sand, the ocean, the sunshine (and sometimes early morning fog), the small souvenir shops, the skateboarders, the lifeguards, the volleyballers, the cyclists, the panhandlers, and the occasional celebrity sighting. Come for a stroll and leave feeling like you really visited Southern California!",Ray Q

50,Peace,"We visited in early December and the feeling was just amazing. A vast beach, larger than you could ever imagine if you have not been there and the pacific ocean at your feet. It is a peaceful scenery which definitely worth a visit, even during winter. Dont forget to take a baywatch-like video, the baywatch of course being yourself.",ilGrec0
20,Not the nicest place in the world,"Not quite like the movies. There are loads of rubbish bins which don't look too good. Even with the bins, there was rubbish everywhere. Many homeless people sleeping on the beach during the day. Not a pleasant experience.",Rudy24

40,Nice beach,"Nice beach next to Downtown Santa Monica. While we were there, we saw a girl rollerblading. She seemed like she knew where she was going and what she was doing. As she walked by two gentlemen that were seated. ""Can you guys tell me which way is Venice?"" in a seemingly pretentious voice. Perhaps she was genuinely lost? Or maybe she was just very attention seeking.",Adrian C
40,To see the sunset!,Went there with my friends to see sunset and it didn't disappoint me at all.It was a bit chilly October but it was worth their seeing many people skateboarding.,Minnie P
50,Swings,"Good place for a walk, or if you're lucky you can find a swing set and just swing on the beach. Highly recommended.",Daniel M

50,Thanksgiving,"Migrated to Santa Monica whenever possible to get away from our rental 2 blocks off of Venice Beach. Great Bike rental place called Jays, ask for Kirby. He was awesome!

Had a lovely time with our family on Santa Monica Beach for Thanksgiving.",Deanna D
50,"Walk, Skate, Run, or Cycle Forever!","This is the place to exercise. Or just sit in the sand and relax. The bike/pedestrian path is well maintained and seems to go on forever.

There was lots going on on the pier, the funfair wasn't too busy so was able to play games without queuing.We looked at most of the surrounding restaurants but ended up eating at bubba gumps.The beach was really nice, we had a lovely walk, it was fairly busy but not like people were getting in your way busy. You could spend a whole day here easily.",Kaveli
50,Great place to relax,"Wide, even and with good infrastructure (toilets, parkings, etc). Highly recommended. Looking towards west which gives you great opportunity to see (or take photos) sunset. Don't forget about Santa Monica Pier which is nearby and gives lot of extra opportunities to have great time.",MaGPL

50,"Classic, nice and calm","Santa Monica is everything that you imagine about the California beaches, it is very clean, quiet, it’s never overcrowded and the water is amazing, there are life guards in the shore too. You can walk around the famous Santa Monica Pier and see its wheel of fortune, buy clothes, bathing suits, and souvenirs and also have something to eat. It is a good idea to spend the whole day in Santa Monica, so try to arrive early, enjoy the beach and then you can go shopping in the city, there are a lot of nice stores.",Michelle Garces
50,Blazing Saddles bike rentals on the Santa Monica Pier,"Visited Blazing Saddles (also owned by Perry's) on the Santa Monica Pier. Our group of 10 went on a guided tour from the Pier to Venice Beach and the ride was beautiful and scenic. The rental process took minutes and there were many bikes to choose from, they were well maintained and in good condition.The trail was clean and very spacious to share with other bikers, runners, and walkers. The trail is on the sand and just steps away from the waves. Our guide Marty was great! He shared a lot of rich history about the buildings, development, and transformations in Santa Monica that we wouldn't have learned anywhere else! Marty had scheduled brief stops along the bike path to share more historical highlights and he cared to remind us to drink plenty of water throughout the bike tour. The tour was only 2 hours. My favorite stop was at the Venice Canals, the buildings were eclectic, traditional, and modern...a must see! Our group was not tired (we were more energized) after the tour we went to lunch at one of the many restaurants on the Pier. Blazing Saddles location is great too, its conveniently just 1 block from the sightseeing views, official Route 66 sign and 3rd Street shopping Promenade.I highly recommend the guided bike tour with friends and family or join a group on the tour...and make sure to ask for Marty!",hikelover2016
50,Very clean beach... pleasantly surprised,"I have not been to many LA area beaches, but I have been to a lot in the Caribbean and in Texas. This beach was much cleaner than most. Nice little foot wash area, not overly crowded, plenty of space to grab a spot to enjoy the view.",Marilee H
50,Beautiful beach,"Visited Santa Monica last month, absolutely loved the beach, the bike trail, the activities, restaurants, and shops along the beach. Would definitely visit again.",TheWorldTraveler2025
50,Beach and Sand excellent,"Best beaches, can walk for miles and visit Venice Beach and Santa Monica Pier. However it would be better if there were more small restaurants along the way - need many more places to eat between Santa Monica and Venice beaches.",Jan_S163
50,Clean and huge!!,"An amazing beach, it's got signs all over about not littering and it makes it such a clean beach. There's different sections for surfers or just general people. There's so many free activities too, swings on the beach, gym equipment, cycle path just off the beach, volleyball courts (counted over 30), patches of raised grass where people do yoga in front of the sea. Just a great all round beach and if you want to go with family it's perfect or if you want to be sporty it's just as perfect.",Sean N
40,Beautiful & Peaceful,"The beach is stunning, of course! It's very big (and wide) so there's lots of space to spread out. Lots of homeless folk slept out on the beach by night, but everyone is friendly and tends to mind their own business. From where my hotel was located (near the Third Street Promenade), it was a lengthy walk to get to the beachfront. There were lots of winding stairs and paths to get there. It wasn't a lengthy walk, but probably not best for those looking to have easy access to the beachfront.",Kaylee N
30,A great place to stop along the Pacific coast highway,"As you're traveling north along the Pacific coast highway, you should definitely stop at the Santa Monica pier.Entertainment abounds as musicians sing and play instruments all along the pier. Every 30 yards or so you'll encounter a new one.This is also a great place to get souvenirs. You'll find a variety of items at reasonable prices in shops as well as individual stands.There are plenty of places to grab a bite to eat along the pier. There is also an area full of rides for young and old alike. The Santa Monica pier boasts the world's only solar powered Ferris wheel.Be sure to check out the historic information near the end of the pier. You'll learn interesting facts about the history of the Santa Monica pier. For example, we learned that the character Popeye was inspired by an actual sailor who hung out around the area.The Santa Monica pier is definitely worth a stop.",Heather E
50,Great time to visit Santa Monica Beach,"Crowds, what crowds?? Fall is one of the prettiest times of the year to visit Santa Monica beach with light people traffic. Access it through the wonderful bike path, walk to, or drive. Can be chilly so dress warm. Can be windy so kite flying is fun this time of year and the sunsets are spectacular as you can see. Also close to Venice Beach which has its own unique culture.",Bob P

50,Beach,The beach is what you make of it. Bring what you want and remember to leave the beach cleaner than you found it.You can swim or just watch the skyline.Take a walk let your feet feel the sand.

Let your mind be free from the tension that comes with life.Choose to be happy in the place your in.Take a selfie picture of you and the ocean and share with your friends.,Tony V
50,Nice,So this beach is much nicer than Venice beach and it's just down the road. No homeless here and it's clean and well maintained .,Jasonburk
40,Regular beach goer,"Santa Monica beach is very clean, accessible beach. Can be very business during tourist high season but thins out during off season. Far better than Venice as that beach has turned into a homeless, uncharacteristic place. Long Beach areas, good bike riding and comfortable climate. Waves and under tow can vary greatly so ask lifeguards if your not familiar.",Mark G
40,Wide beach,"The beach is very wide and therefore, there is plenty of room for everyone. We were there on a weekday so it was not terribly crowded. I would imagine the weekends are much more crowded. The views are pretty, and we also made pictures on the pier.",Tammy L
50,Great Sunday hang,"Beautiful beach, easy access, and lots with things to sea and do! All within walking distance to downtown .And ahhh the Sandy beach",Arloredrock
50,Flat and spacious,I was impressed by how much beach there is- it stretches a long distance between the water & the street. I also liked how flat it was that you could easily walk the beach instead of the bike/walking paths.,SarahSeestheWorld
50,Miles of sand,There is enough beach here for everyone to find a place to lay down one's blanket without having anyone next to them. You can gather by the pier where there is foot-washing station and toilets or move farther down. There are lifeguard stations sprinkled up and down the beach. The waves are gentle enough for little kids to play by the edge (of course with supervision) and make sandcastles.,TartanCat57
50,Nice,Been in LA a week and Santa Monica is one of the top 5 beaches on the coast. Parking is a little pricey. But besides that very clean and nice. Lots of shops and carnival style pier,Joyce and Dean
40,Great beach to visit,We visited Santa Monica Beach after going on the Pier.The beach is very clean and tidy with lots of places to hangout with your family and friends. It is also a great place to see the sunset!!!It is a great walk down to Venice beach from Santa Monica however the walk does take a while but it is a relaxing walk and I recommend taking the time to do it - lots to see along the way.Toilets and rubbish bins are everywhere which is great to see and helps keep the place tidy.,Gareth L
50,Clean,"First time seeing the ocean I was glad to do it at Santa Monica Beach. Super clean, very well kept. Easy To get to and plenty of places to park.",kaitlin8899

40,"Great afternoon in Santa Monica: Third Street Promenade, Pier, Beach, Dinner!","Here's the itinerary I use to show people around when they say they “must see” Santa Monica!S A N T A M O N I C APark:Park in Santa Monica Parking Structure 6 or 7 because these are at the south end start of Third Street Promenade, the pedestrian shopping street.Third Street Promenade:Walk north up the length of Third Street Promenade. Enjoy the shops and atmosphere. Use the clean public bathrooms.Pier:To walk from Third Street Promenade to the pier, turn left onto Wilshire Blvd where the promenade ends on the north side. Then turn left onto Ocean Avenue and take this popular pedestrian sidewalk to Santa Monica Pier. There are clean bathrooms at the pier. There are also rides that were inspiration for the rocket ships in the Jimmy Neutron movie (2001), which I loved as a kid.Beach:After the pier, play at the beach if you have time, though I've gotten the comment from my visitors that this beach is not as noteworthy as the ones in Orange County. If you have an extra day in Southern California, head to any of the beaches between Laguna Beach and Dana Point. Better views and less crowds, though you won't get as dramatic of a mountain backdrop like you will here at Santa Monica Beach.Dinner:I tend to take people to have dinner at Umami Burger (get the umami burger and truffle fries) or Cheesecake Factory (portions are great for splitting and sharing, and they have a “Skinnylicious” menu for health-conscious eaters).If you have extra time, consider:(1) visiting downtown Culver City(2) eating dinner at the popular Italian restaurant C&O Cucina, located in Marina Del Rey and known for their garlic knots.Enjoy your visit to Santa Monica!",RTWTravelr

50,Beautiful beach with mountain backdrop,"The Santa Monica is a wide, clean beach. and surrounds the Santa Monica Pier. There is parking near the beach, but visitors can also get economical public transportation right up the beach.The waves were a little brisk today due to a pretty good wind so surfers were having a good time, too. The Santa Monica mountains frame the beach and the scene is so beautiful it could be on a postcard. The beaches are guarded for safety, There is no beach fee, but there is a modest charge for parking. Food is available on the pier, but a lunch with everyone's favorites packed from home can't be beat. Go have some family fun! .",CyndyandByron

50,"As a world traveler, I call this spectacular haven home","Stunning sunsets over the ocean or over the Malibu hills in the distance. A bike path that is bursting with life - cyclists, rollerbladers, runners, walkers, skateboarders. Sand that is larger in area than any beach I have seen in the Caribbean or in SE Asia. Beautiful people. Yes, this is a major draw. Everyone here is fit in a quintessential California way, not a Miami way. People smile all the time in the golden hue that blesses this place. Walk to funky Venice Beach along the bike path - 15 to 20 minutes. You will hear languages from most parts of the world.The famous Santa Monica Pier is touristy, with a number of attractions such as the ferris wheel and rides, and several restaurants with stunning ocean and mountain views. Santa Monica township is a walkbridge away over the famous Rt 1 or the Pacific Coast Highway. The 3rd St Promenade is chockful of restaurants, designer stores, and street artists. This downtown area is fully walkable with a modern open-air mall and bars and cafes all over. Don't miss the Saturday Farmer's Market on Arizona and 3rd. I call this home because it's friendly, large, beautiful, set up to enjoy the outdoor lifestyle, perfect weather year round, and 20 minutes from LAX Airport. Santa Monica Beach is surfing California all the way.Plenty of hotels - all expensive. AirBnB illegal below 30 days.

The morning I visited, it included used condoms, a lone high-heeled shoe, and the usual water bottles, bottle caps, broken beach toys, and plastic bags.",Laene

40,Huge Expanse of Clean Sand,"This Beach is huge, and was not too crowded when we visited – maybe because it was October, and the water was quite cold. But there were quite a few people on the Boardwalk of the Pier, and on the paths of the Palisades Park.The sand was a lovely beige-gold color, and was clean and fine. And, of course, the Sunset as seen from this Beach was marvelous. The surrounding area was well maintained. There were lots of vendors everywhere, and the lifeguards were very attentive.People were spread out, playing volleyball, running, working out, surfing, and doing some Yoga. Many others were just relaxing there and people-watching.A must-visit vibrant place.",TheExplorerFamily
50,Iconic beach - the sand was AMAZING!!,"Our family of 4 (two teens) first parked near the courthouse (up a few blocks from the beach, Saturday parking was only $5 all day). Then walked down the street right onto the beach and headed to the pier.What a GREAT experience. It was Saturday, overcast, just sprinkled but warmed up quickly. We leisurely strolled along the pier and read the history of the pier at the end. We bought some post cards and then ate lunch at Albright's (yum). We also took the time to walk off the pier on to the beach where our teens went into the water (briefly b/c they said it was too cold) and then went on and on and on again about how amazing the sand was, and kept asking if someone had trucked in the sand, etc. (we are from WA near Seattle and most of our beaches are rocky).The beach was very clean, lots of lifeguard shacks (closed for now) and plenty of garbage cans. It was a much cleaner beach and felt safer than Venice Beach.",Michelle D

40,Impressive ocean but cold water,Too cold for swimming but many surfers in wet suits had fun in the waves. The beach is huge and very well kept. Good for strolls at the shoreline.,Eric060
50,Beach volleyball and more!,"Santa Monica Beach had the most beach volleyball courts we'd ever seen! Many were in use because there was some kind of tournament. We saw a beautiful afternoon wedding right on the beach at the water's edge! The scenery is very pretty and makes for amazing photos.We really enjoyed spending time here. Relaxing and peaceful just to hang out and take it all in or if you want to be a bit more active there are plenty of things to choose, from biking to surfing and volleyball.",Usia2014

50,Leisure,"Great beach to hang out, with or without friends. Easy pedestrian approach from Ocean Avenue. The car parking is a long way down the beach.

40,The Califrnia Dream in one place.,"The Santa Monica Beach is the perfect place to start your vacation. Lots of activities to participate in or just hang out and watch. Beach volleyball, slack Line, an outdoor gym with a lot of gymnastic equipment to train w your own body weight. Surfing, there is a lot of places where to rent boards from. Coffee bars and restaurants near the boardwalk. And the Pier is a fantastic amusement centre with rides, snacks and games. Personally I´ll get a snack from one of the many small vendors and just hang out watching the surfers from on top. North of the pier there is a huge sandy beach with a really big parking lot. From there you are close to the shopping and restaurants at the 3rd street promenade. 2-3 miles south of the Santa Monica Pier Venice Beach starts but that´s an other review. Have fun",Peter T

30,hmmm...whats the big deal here?,So...all of this hype about Santa Monica Pier made me so excited! What a let down...being from the UK we have piers like this much better than this all over the UK. Bigger and better. On a different note I LOVED Vegas and Venice Beach!,milly167
40,Afternoon at the beach,"A group of friends and I enjoyed renting bikes and cruising down the bike path.

There were so many people and pets. It was a great afternoon.",tink8009

40,Most crowded tourist spot in LA,"If you are in LA for only 2-3 days and want to get the feel of the place, Santa monica tops your list of places to visit. The crowded beach and a pier with all sorts of people you see in a typical touristy place, it has a theme park, a restaurant and you can see a lot of people fishing at the Pier. The beach is crowded most of the times but the water is shallow and clean. It is colder than what i imagined it would be, based on my experience in atlantic and indian ocean.!",Kutty

50,Great place to watch the sunset,A great beach by any standards but watching a fabulously colourful sunset by the end of the pier was special. The man-made colours of the pier (esp the Ferris wheel and the rollercoaster) contrasted nicely with the natural colours. Lots of people communing gave it a great vibe too!,pd7
40,Very tidy and clean,"Large beach - all very tidy and obviously raked overnight to clear any rubbish. We visited mainly in the mornings so the mob had yet to arrive. Lots of people though doing the athletic thing - running, riding, walking. Lots of people with handbag dogs - there were very few dogs that could really be labelled as such - most were toys that seemed to be carried around. Nice beach and I guess would be of interest to those who like sand and sea but really it is still only a big beach when all is said and done",Grant N

50,"Very Clean Beach, Lovely Walk","Wow! I have not been to California since I was a child and I was surprisingly impressed by how clean and quiet the beach was. Being a Tuesday in October - I guess it is not prime beach season; it was so pleasant to have to beach almost all to myself.I was so delighted to see how clean the city and visitor alike keep the beach. Quite frankly - I expected to see more litter, etc.My only regret is that I did not have more time to spend on the beach.I was lucky enough to stay at a hotel on the beach and have a gorgeous view right out of my room to enjoy even when I was not down in the sand.And just like many other parts of Santa Monica - people watching was awesome - especially at Muscle Beach.",2013Wren

I love how expansive it is, the quaint lifeguard towers and how popular it is with locals and tourists. There are always crowds of people walking, running, cycling, working out, swimming, sightseeing and socialising. They are happy and fun loving. The only negative is that the water is always cold - great on a 104degrees day (like today!) though. The walking path both north and south along this beautiful beach is picturesque and inviting.

50,Beach bum,I grew up a block away on Alta I remember this beach and love this beach. It's gotten more tourist action of recent. But if your wanting to check it out make sure to park accordingly. If your going to the pier and it's a holiday park at the mall. Anywhere near the beach will charge you upwards of 30 dollars. Better park at the mall for free and get a validation spend the money somewhere else. You have meter parking along the beach just watch the signs. If your. Gym buff and workout on the Equipement near the pier there is parking on pch 1 highway. More beach for our kids and less Television that's how we grew up.,globaltreck36

50,So much fun,"Grab bikes and ride along the coastal route to venice. Quick ride, but a long walk! Having a bike gives you so much time to venture round and go along all the shops and parks on the front of the beaches.",Connie E
50,Great beach!,"Wide, clean, and lots of room for everyone! Our family set up a spot on the beach between Pico and Bicknell, where there was a vendor renting surf boards and body boards ($20/2 hrs & $10/2 hrs respectively). The ocean conditions are perfect for beginners of both sports: mild waves and a long shallow beach that allows people to stand up 100 meters into the water. There were lots of beginner and expert surfers as well as plenty of lifeguards. We felt very safe allowing our young children to try out the water sports. Bathroom and outdoor shower facilities are available. The beach also features wonderful separated pedestrian and bike paths. You can easily follow it from Santa Monica Pier to Venice Beach.",Buffyanna

50,Brits on the beach,"I have no pics but as someone who lives in Manchester, UK; being on the beach on NYE is the most amazing experience! I wish I lived near the beach so I could spend my mornings cycling along the beach and watching the world go by. If you're not local, go! You will regret it but only because your life will never be the same; you will leave a part of your soul on Santa Monica beach",Clare W
50,Honeymoon,Prettiest beach I have ever seen. I'm not a beach lover. I can't stand the sand between my toes but this was something special! The weather was perfect warm with a breeze.

Not really any waves, a few small ones, from what we saw Malibu is the place for waves. All of the amenities are on the south side of the pier or on the pier though so we got changed in the car.Parking is $12 for the day, to park right at the beach/pier and the spaces are tight, fill up fast too.The sand was pretty clean too, only saw one or two pieces of rubbish.",R0wi3

30,Busy beach,"This beach was terribly busy and we had to walk a distance to find a quieter spot; clearly a popular spot given its location. On a clear day you get some stunning views.My biggest complaint is that there was a considerable amount of trash on the beach, most notably a couple of dirty diapers, despite there being trash cans everywhere (particularly those areas closer to the pier)Suggestions* Come early* Avoid coming at peak hrs on the weekend as it's much more crowded* Park in one of the parking lots a couple blocks from the beach. Some have free parking for the first 90 min and cheap rates after that.",Rebecca

The possibilities are endless. You can borrow surfboards and have lessons how to surf, or if you prefer you can get a bike, play volleyball, or run if you still have too much energy. For the kids, if the water isn't enough for them there is a Ferris wheel for example.Going by car, the parking fee is $10. - for two hours.",stinkwink

The Santa Monica beach is about three times as wide as the beaches back home in NJ, making our beaches back east tiny by comparison.

People were polite and kept to themselves. We were still able to find a spot to take in the view while children played in the water. There were sail boats, hand gliders, volleyball players and every kind of classic activity you'd expect to see on a Southern California Beach. It was a little windy but well worth it to see the sun set, to walk on soft sand and breath in fresh air.",wethrivelife

Beach was extra crowded on the day of our visit. Trash everywhere except in the big trash bins that were on the beach next to the beach goers. That was not appealing to say the least. If you don't expect too much and don't mind trash washing up on the shore, then I'd recommend. Not too much to see on the pier itself, other than the rides.",jymart

The sand is light but not white and I thought it was clean considering the number of people visiting. We saw a man with a metal detector but all he found was a quarter. There is a Ferris Wheel and other fun rides for kids but we stuck to the boardwalk.

There are amenity blocks at the back of the beach, and outdoor showers for washing off afterwards.As someone brought up on the beaches of Sydney the water temperature was comparable. The water has the reputation for being cold, but it was similar to Sydney in early summer I thought.What wasn't comparable was the clarity of the water - it seemed a good deal murkier.

The beach is massive, it wasn't busy when I got there but even when more people arrived there was plenty of room as it's such a long beach. I visited on a Friday so don't know what it would be like at the weekend. There were sellers trying to get you to buy brollies and boogie boards but they did not pester. Overall a great beach to relax, swim, surf and cycle if you are looking for something more active. Lots of hire places and loads of people on the bike path that runs along the beach.

Firstly, the parking is $10 a day or $2 for 2hr in designated places. The beach is long and wide, but everyone sits along the shoreline. There are volleyball nets and workout areas along the beach, along with toilet blocks. There is a cycle path that also runs along the beach. There are plenty of life guard stations along the beach as there is plenty of surf and the waves are high. The sea itself is lovely to paddle in but the waves come in quick and high! The nearer you get to the pier the more crowded and dirtier the beach is. There is also a high police presence with cars patrolling the beach. It's just a long sandy beach, nothing special.",Susan W

50,Santa Monica beach,Beautiful beach that stretches as far as the eye can see. Good amount but not the most massive of waves to watch surfers or do some surfing yourself.,Chris C
50,Beautiful beach,Visited in August and my 2nd visit to the beach. Very busy but never seemed crowed and my daughter loved wave surfing!,PaulH80
50,Gorgeous Lunch Location!,"This is a beautiful beach! We got sandwiches at Bay Cities Deli (also reviewed) and came to the beach for lunch. It was a gorgeous day, so it was really hopping! There is a biking/walking path, restrooms, food trucks, and the Santa Monica Pier is in full view!",Gracie12009
50,Incredible beach,"This is a vast, broad glorious beach that stretches for miles. Do take parasols and mats or beach chairs as these are difficult to find here. There are public toilets.",Anne87London
50,Great views and good walk!,"Stopped here while visiting LA and really enjoyed our time on the pier and walking down the beach. Since we are from Miami Florida, we were pleasantly surprised with the lovely cool breeze and the beach. Totally enjoyed ourselves!",jewelmom
50,Stunning,"The beach can be difficult to access in certain parts of Santa Monica, so go for a parking area or one of the several beach front restaurants with their customer only access points. The area is stunning, clean and goes on for miles, can be tiresome to try and get parked but its worth your time.",TeamWard
40,Overwhelmingly busy,If you've never been I would go. The Ferris wheel at night is amazing. There were still people streaming down the boardwalk at 11pm. Just be aware if you park at parking garage on Colorado street it gets insanely busy. We waited an hour in line just to get out into the traffic on the street because someone got hurt and needed an ambulance. We made the mistake of paying before we got into the car and we used our 20 minute limit and ended up having to pay an additonal 1.50 to exit. Someone ahead of us had their passenger jump out right near the exit go to the machine and pay there. The ticket taking machine only accepts cards so if you cash you have no choice but to use one of the cash accepting machines. If you have a limited amount of time maybe skip Santa Monica in favor of some of the less crowded areas because it sucked an entire afternoon just dealing with traffic and long wait times.,Jennelle S
40,Great City Beach,"Really wide and open beach so close to the city. It was a bit cold and windy when we were there and therefore probably not so crowded. Perfect for a plunge in the Pacific, although the waves and the current became quite treacherous at one point.",AVDM81
50,Massive beach,"This is a great beach. It is massive, well massive compared to what you get here in Ireland. Well worth a visit.",Centre p
50,Huge beautiful beach!,So much to do!!! The sand is like sugar....so clean and soft. You can see ocean and mointains...or hills...so cool.,Candy
20,Horrible parking,Beach was gorgeous with lots of people. Going around for hours with no success in finding parking. Will probably never go back.,merryp234
50,Fun in Santa Monica,"Being from the East Coast, we found the ocean too cold in LA. But the pier is great. The view from the top of the ferris wheel is one of a kind. And the Expo Line on Metro Rail brings you right there from Downtown LA.",John L
30,Hot beach cold water,Nice to get away from the sunset Blvd.The trick is to get a nice spot on the beach so walk around first before you settle.Fun for the children with clean bathroom facilities; a bit of a walk away if you're near the pier.A must see...for families I think.,DreamJetsetter
20,Overcrowded and dirty,Came to the beach on Sunday and I must say I was quite disappointed. The beach was full of litter and pigeons. Not somewhere that you want to chill out. Apart from Blackpool beach this is one of the dirtiest beaches I have been too!,Carmchanbrahar
50,Fabulous beach,"Its an amazing sand beach, clean , toilet facilities all the way to Venice beach, it's so wide too wow.",pip t
50,Legendary,Have to visit the home of Baywatch when you come to LA... The beach gets really busy around the pier bit but it's worth the trip to take a dip in the Ocean,Phil C
50,Beautiful white sands and blue ocean,A lovely beach on a lovely day. The wooden walkway also helps save feet being burnt on the hot sand.,Ferryfo
30,Crowded Beach,"Went to Santa Monica Beach to the right of the Pier and it was so very crowded, even for a Monday afternoon. We decided on this part of the beach because of the proximity to the pier thinking we'd spend some time on the pier. We ended up only on the Pier to use the restrooms. We spent a couple of hours at the beach. Parking next to the pier is $12 but if you are hanging out at the beach and the Pier then it's worth it to be close. Word of advice...rinse/wash your swim suits/towels right when you get back to the hotel or they will stink like the ocean water and it's hard to get the smell out. Never had this issue with the Caribbean beaches/water. It's free to the public but parking isn't free.",TravelingParent1
50,heaven on earth,"love this beach so much, what an ocean, what a beach. the cold water and the wind help me cool in the heatwave that is currently happening in Southern California",countpoldi
40,A Day at the Pier,We caught Hop on Hop off to Santa Monica and then spent the day walking to the the end of the Pier and the surrounding area where there were great food options and rides and lots of shops. Lots of people so don't rush the day as a great way to spend the day.,libartAustralia
40,Summer Fly Drive,"Amazing beach, you can walk for miles. There are no beach beds/chairs or umbrella's to hire, so will need to bring your own.",Tu88z
20,Very disappointing,"Was really looking forward to visiting the iconic Santa Monica beach, but what a disappointment. It was crowded, but that's not the fault of the beach obviously. What was really disappointing was the state of the beach - it was dirty with all sorts of trash and waste strewn over it. I have seen better beaches in the UK, and that's saying something!A couple of days later we went further north to Westward beach - this is how we imagine a California beach to be! My advice - avoid the hordes and go further north, you will not be disappointed.",5121Brownstone
50,Beautiful beach!,This is just a wonderful big beach. Long and wide with great waves. There is a nice parking lot very close. (but get there early as its not that big for how big the beach is). The pier is right there for plenty of food and fun when you want a break.,J0hnPM10
50,Really nice,I can't wait to go back there. Unbelievable place with cool beaches and boulevards. Lots of nice restaurants too.,Josep H
40,Beautiful beach.,"Nice city beach. Bit of a walk down to the beach and the water from the cliffs, but worth the effort.",John B
40,Beautiful but so busy,"Santa Monica beach is definitely worth a visit, although we visited during the holiday weekend, which unsurprisingly meant the beach was jammed with people!",Natalie B
50,Beautiful Sandy Beach,A huge beach that when we visited was very quiet. There were people close to the water but it was mostly deserted. The sand is clean and ideal for families,Selgris
10,Not clean and can't recommend it,such public beach that has so many people with minimum services aren't recommended. You will see people stilling fruits that are not inspected and some are utilizing the beach in scary manners. I did not like it nether felt safe.,Sami Al-Hamad
50,Feet in the Sand,This was the first beach that we visited since we landed in California. It was so nice to see the ocean again and the weather was just perfect. Nothing better then seeing the Ferris Wheel from the beach,Vacation105
20,Looks nice from a distance but up close..,Santa Monica is a nicer part of L.A. But it still suffers from the same problems as L.A. The beach looks nice from up on the roadside but once on it there is so much rubbish everywhere and bins overflowing and not to mention the tramps fishing in the bins for food! I wouldn't recommend any beach in LA to be honest and visited them all.,r0biati
40,Beach in Santa Monica,"We love the beach . Water was warm, friendly, spent slot of time in the ocean. A favourite beach.its a long walk to the beach but well worth it. Our hotel offers beach chairs with umbrellas, so that makes it easy.",arleneMontrealQuebec
50,Fabulous beach,"Great beach for relaxing as not overcrowded. Super safe & secure with well trained life guards on duty. There is a list of rules for people to follow on the beach, one of which is no alcohol is allowed to be consumed, excellent idea & I'm sure helps this place remain even safer.",SueMcCann1
50,Really good Beach,"Great Beach, good waves, great sand and not so much people. Nice here. Great for Kids and there parents. Nice possibilities to take a run in the Morning.",417wolfgangh

50,lifelong fave,I've loved visiting this beach for at least 20 years now... tons of stuff to keep you busy and first time sights to see.,TKitch21
50,Fun beach with lots to do!,"Great place to bring the family! We love to ride on the bike path and visit the pier and promenade especially! A warning for your visit! DO NOT PARK IN THE UNATTENDED LOTS NEXT TO THE SAND! There are thieves that target these lots and break into cars to take anything left behind, and they are very fast and organized. My van was broken into in less then 2 mins while I was just a 100 ft away using the restroom! Went down to the police station to file a report and was told it was very common in the unattended lots to have your car broken into! Don't worry there isn't a safety issue, they wait for you to leave and don't confront you!",Rob B
30,crowded,"Very crowded, but overall a fun time. We have been to the gulf so it wasn't what I was expecting since I have never seen the Pacific before.",ronnie592016
40,Crowded but absolutely wonderful,Really nice beach. Clean. Lifeguards present. Don't go in Saturday's super crowded. 40 minutes to find parking. Easy walk to the beach.,Rose H
10,Shame to let such a pretty area get trashed.,I was expecting a similar if not better experience for the coastal area having been to San Diego and the communities near there. I was sadly disappointed. Trash was everywhere and homeless were not at all discouraged to set up living along the sidewalks of both walking paths and near the boardwalk pier area everywhere. I'm not unsympathetic to the homeless problem but they should be helped and managed in a more appropriate way.I won't go back!,southernfoodie2016
40,Fourth of July Weekend,This beach was packed 4th of July weekend. Beach was clean which is awesome. I would bring my daughter here.,Jenia C

30,Fun to see if down there,"It's fun to see, but not sure I'd make a special trip to see it or waste a day of vacation on it, it's a beach. Tons of people watching, rings and beach toys people are playing with-",JoSteere
40,Nice place to spend time,The beach has a mall near by (Santa Monica Place mall) and a McDonalds. Options are available for those who wish to rent a bi-cycle. It has a zone where children can spend time with different games. There is only one shower and it has long queue.,Vkothari1
50,Great Place to Stroll and See the Sights,Beautiful location with safe streets lined with interesting shops and restaurants. The stroll along the bluff above the ocean is a wonderful place to walk your dog and people watch. Lots of places in the shade or sun. The downtown is a thriving spot with many big stores.,D. N
50,Unspoilt,Had a lovely stroll along the beach. Ended up having a very expensive lunch in the Shutters hotel as my elderly mother found it a struggle walking too far in the heat! The beach is massive and a long walk on the hot sand to the sea!You have to go here..... I loved it. Typical Californian beach,jackiejax40

50,Beach n Bike,"Lots to do and see at Santa Monica beach... Your a mile or so easy bike from Venice Beach as well. There are playground areas for the young and older. Locals will entertain you on the swinging rings -it's like a free circus act. You have the Santa Monica pier at one side and the Venice Beach full of small shops, booths and restaurants at the other. The whole Beach is spotted with bike and beach stuff rental booths, A few on the sand eateries, and lifeguard stations, lots of fun for a family day.",Kristin O
50,Beach for everyone,"Wow! I've been traveling lot in Southeast Asia and Europe but I have never seen such well planned and organized beach where you can do any kind of activities, whether it is sunbathing, jogging, cycling, playing sports in the sand, surfing or just walk around and enjoy Californian sun and crowd. The beach looks endless and I have been here both with my family and jogging alone and any time my heart was full of lovely views and people enjoying free time activities. Beach is located close to Santa Monica famous pier or Santa Monica downtown and is easy to reach both by subway from DTLA, buss or car. There is lot of parking lots all the way next to the beach and parking costs about 15$. If you are taking car, count on high traffic in Santa Monica, so plan your visit well and enjoy this adorable place. Next time I visit LA I will rent a place closer to this beach to have more beach time.If you are visiting the beach for swimming activities you have to know that Pacific Ocean in Santa Monica does not provide warm water compared to Southern Europeans seas in summer or other locations suited for enjoying the sea. My opinion was that the see is pretty cold, even though warm summer weather it was ""just"" 19 degrees Celsius, but there is hundreds of people who daily enjoy swimming here. I focused more to observe and enjoy every second of this wonderful place!",Nenad J
30,"Great place to visit but don't go on the sand, and only 1 shower","Great place to walk around, pier is lovely and shops are great, cheesecake factory across the road was a bonus, but we took our kids to the beach and were shocked at how much rubbish was on the beach in the sand, including glass!! why doesn't the council clean this!The sand is also dirty sand, this may be normal along the beaches here I'm not sure, but just letting people know. Hence, we did not go back to the beach again. I hate seeing beaches ruined by humanities blatant laziness not to take their rubbish with them or place in the bins provided!The line to have a shower in the 1 shower provided was horrendous! One shower, look at my pics at how many people on the beach!",Renee V
50,Great Family Outing,We were visiting from landlocked Iowa and spent the afternoon at the Santa Monica Beach.The beach was clean with decent showers and restroom facilities. We parked at the lot 1/3 mile South of the pier (on ocean Ave) . It's right on the beach and was $8 for the day vs $12 at the pier and much less hectic (both the parking lot and the beach).Also check out the original muscle beach (next to the pier) and the pier. There are quieter beaches but if you need variety for your family Santa Monica had something to offer everyone.,herd_of_6
50,Very very nice beach...,Ive been there with my friends. The waves was amazing.. i highly recommend to rent a bike there and explore the beach...,Ameer E
40,Good people watching,Easy to walk on beach after visiting the pier. Play on the swings and workout equipment. We also rented bikes and road down the beach to Venice Beach as well. Didn't swim or do the water as it was January and too chilly,tengland40
50,Great Fun!!!!,"This beach was amazing, love sandy beaches, lifeguards are very aware of what is going on and makes you feel safer. It is very family friendly and has facilities close by (restaurants, toilets, changing rooms.) The only thing that was missing was a bit of shade but the overall experience was amazing. There is great parking space available for 10 dollars for the whole day.",Hanna R
50,great,"You need to get there early by noon its a very crowed place at least on the weekend, very nice for a public place to visit, people need to pick up their trash,little dirtier than i thought it would be.",craig s
40,Huge beach with pleasant atmosphere,It is a great wat to spend the day in Santa Monica. I had a bike and went to Venice Beach as well for a complete experience.,J.. Guilherme Rodrigues
50,Great Fun!,"Took a walk down the Santa Monica pier and enjoyed it very much. This was very different and much more family friendly than Venice beach. The pier included shops and food places along with multiple different rides for the kids, and adults also. As we walked further down the pier we enjoyed the people fishing and the clear blue water. Definitely a must see!",whw2217
40,Enjoying,This beach is a very and fancy one besides being quite crowded because it is more a touristic place. I would advice you to go there and then walk around 30' to the Venice Beach as you'll have a different atmosphere during the walk in the promenade and you may see lovely houses. It takes 1hour and a half to do everything but it is highly recommended,lvcardoso
50,Beach paradise,The large sandy beach at Santa Monica is well worth a visit. The traffic trying to get to Santa Monica is another matter. Took us 40 mins to go 1 mile yesterday.Beach clean and lots of room as it's huge. No brollies and loungers as seen in Europe but can hire them from Perry's.Plenty of cafes and restaurants rooms. I didn't visit any public rest rooms but they looked ok from outside.,Amanda C
40,Beautiful Beach,The santa monica pier has been on my travel wish list for quite some time. Living in a land locked state (Oklahoma) I always love going to the beach while traveling. The beach was gorgeous. Lots of people out soaking up the sun and having fun.,kimberlyhh2015
50,White sand and Clear Water,"This was by far the nicest beach we visited in California. The water was warm and clean enough to swim in. It is a very relaxed atmosphere, too.",gh427
50,Beach life at its Californian best,"Huge expansive of beach, be prepared to walk a long way out to reach the sea. Plenty to do along the boardwalk, cycle, skate, jog, dance or cartwheel anything goes.",Well_travelled_Dad
30,Ok,Not like valencia and nice in France. But decent very lively beach alot of dirt and tong. There is alot children,Nana Piesie
50,Great people watching.,"Santa Monica Beach provides something for everyone. It's a huge beach with plenty of room to spread out, to throw a frisbee, or to just relax. It is surrounded by beautiful views of the mountains and the coast. There are food trucks, cafes, snack bars a restaurants nearby, offering a wide variety of food and drink options. If you're into fitness, try the muscle beach area just south of the pier. There is also a wide walking and biking path that stretches along the beach, and is a great place to walk, jog, skate, or bike. And the nearby Santa Monica Pier has fun games and rides for the kids.",ERFSU82
50,We had a fabulous family day out!,"We went here whilst travelling the Pacific Coast Highway. We parked the car for the day in the big main carpark by the pier. It cost $15.Before heading to the beach we explored the very busy pier and Pacific Park amusements. We went on the Ferris Wheel which I would recommend as it gives views up and down the huge expanse of beach and over the city. There are plenty of toilets and outlets to buy ice cream and other food and a couple of restaurants, cafes and lots of stalls selling souvenirs. The queues were not too long despite it being very busy. Then we wandered onto the wonderful beach and played in the sand. My children found a large gymnastics park with rings, asymmetric bars and parallel bars and even a sprung floor! On the beach! They were in heaven trying it all out. The sand was so soft and the beach huge. We would have hired bikes and cycled to Venice Beach but I had fallen over a tree root a few days earlier and fractured my ribs! So my children played in the water diving into the big waves instead. Unbelievably, when we first arrived at the car park my 17 year old son immediately recognised the scene from Grand Theft Auto!! He had parked his cyber car there before and driven under the pier along the cycle path to the gymnastics. How bizarre is that?!",Falkirkdolly
50,Gorgeous,Stunning views and the weather was perfect. Such beautiful and well kept landscaping. It offered convenient and clean services. Loved it!!,Lucky Travel Junkie
40,Great place to visit with kids!,"Beach was beautiful, very clean! Pier was nice and very kid friendly atmosphere. Would defiantly recommend a stop here if in California.",jdressel1
30,Santa Monica Pier,"A cool place to visit, but very crowded. We did not stay very long, due to the crowds. It was a Sunday evening, maybe a weekday would be a better choice.",djjeh5
40,Nice but crowded,"We visited the beach and pier with family. What I love about the beach is how expansive it is. There is an incredible distance between the water and where the sand ends (i.e. Road, parking lot, etc) so there is plenty of space to run around and play. Now, we were there in May when it was still a bit cool (I'm from Florida so I get cold when it dips below 75). There were a lot of people! The pier was miserable because all you did was dodge people the entire time due to how crowded it was. There isn't anything special to see there so just skip it and stay on the beach. There were some fun street shows just off the pier though.",Natalie B
50,Unforgettable!,"I was study at Santa Monica for just few months . I think no one don't love this place ~I go sushi restaurant and bar after school very often,also i go beach three time a week~its really relax !

40,"Sun, sea, sand.",Nice beach. Plenty clean and with a nice pier. Sea views are spectacular as expected but can often be busy. Parking can also be an issue at peak and there are lots of eateries in the area so food and drink shouldn't be a problem.,Tobias S

30,"Overrated, no beach rentals","It was a hot day, teenagers didn't mind sunning on their beach towels, but for 60+ (me and my mom), we preferred the Miami Beach experience where we could rent chairs and umbrellas and relax. Also, the shops and little restaurants were just meh...",Pam H
40,Perfect view of the ocean,Perfect view of the ocean and for bike rides and walks to take in the atmosphere of Santa Monica. Not far from Santa Monica pier where you can watch the Sunset.,Emily B
40,Love!,My husband and I visited the pier while on vacation for our anniversary. The weather was remarkable. The sites... The cheap natural fun were all superb. I wholeheartedly recommend this beach to fun seekers that is inexpensive yet not boring!!,Twainna
30,Definitely for tourists,This beach is crowded and loud. The views of the ocean of course are beautiful but if you want quiet and relaxing and nature filled this is not the beach for you.,JRae65
50,Great for a morning walk,Nice beach with lots going on and great for people watching. Lovely for a morning or sunset stroll and usually lots of entertainment as the day goes on,Carol1911

50,Pretty Beach!,"It is southern CA so there will be crowds. I'm used to northern CA where the water is cold and fewer people. This was SO different. They groom the beach every morning with tractors! That was an unusual site for me. Also not used to life guard towers. Boy, you had better listen to them!It is a longer walk from the Santa Monica Pier to Venice Pier than it looks!Cute little shells, fun to watch the surf classes, the water was warm but it was mid July. Nice place",blackdog-travels

50,Great waves and smooth sand!,After visiting the Pier headed straight to the beach! Only thing you really have to be careful of is walking in the sand to get to the beach… there was chunks of glass and razor blades (I wouldn't recommend walking barefoot!)😑😩 Once we made it to the harder sand it was fine! There was a nice breeze coming off the ocean and the waves were awesome to watch. Ended walking the beach line for about 2 miles and really refreshing!! Once a wave comes up if you dig your hand under the sand about 2 inches these interesting little critters came up but idk what they are but they were cool looking. Learned that from a group of kids gathered haha best thing I learned all day!,PlaytimewithMiss_T_e
50,Just as you see in the movies,"This is exactly what you'd expect.It's a wide, long beach, close to restaurants and the pier, and lots of people, but not too many, soaking up the sun and enjoying the surf.",Andrew S
50,Memorable,I had a great afternoon with my partner. A place food for relaxation. The feel of the sand on your feet. The sea breeze blowin touchin your skin. It was a wondeful feeling.It could get chilly at night though. Would recommend bringing sweatshirt if you intend to stay till night.,ellene_santos
50,Just being here!,The fact of being here and recognizing it from movies and tv series is an experience in itself. And then having something to drink or eat and just sit and watch everyone passing by and the commerce going on. Love it!,agd2015
40,Nice,"Nice sand, beach view is great. Spent a couple of hours. Enjoyed the waves. Very peaceful on weekdays. Can be crowded on weekends.",Manu B
10,Stay away,Beach by the pier is crazy busy - you can barely walk. Hundreds of people in one location it was ridiclous. Lots of people peddling their goods too. There are better beaches more north that arent so crowded and cleaner. We wont make the mistake of going here again - we even went on a weekday!,KristenS_11

50,Great attraction,"The beach of Santa Monica is one of the most famous attractions to visit in Los Angeles , the mix of people there is amazing , you will miss a lot not being there 😋",DrArafat
50,Beautiful,"The beach area was very large. Make sure you wear sandals because the access is very long and hot. It would be a good idea to bring water and an umbrella because although the sell them on the beach, they are quite pricey. The water is quite cold but many peopl still went in.",Christine M
40,Clean and lovely,Lovely beach even better when the weather is nice. Saw some of the sporting activities going on there. Didn't get in the water however it looked ok from a distance. Not really much else to say after all it's just a beach. Definitely better than Venice Beach.,Emuobor D

50,Really starting my summer off right,Hanging with my friend at the beach what better way to spend part of my weekend it's a beautiful thing to come and visit wish I could afford to move here the air is absolutely awesome to smell the sea coming off the breeze,Michael B
40,Great beach but lacking amenities,"Our favorite beach in LA is reached from Arizona St and Ocean Ave staircase. I go there with my son while my wife shops on the promenade in Santa Monica. The beach is very wide and provides a spectacular view of Santa Monica Bay and surrounding cliffs. Water is quite cold, but tolerable, and surf can get pretty rough at times. Bike rental and snack shop with umbrellas are available along the beach path. My one gripe is the lack of a changing room and the really bad public bathrooms. With all the wealth in SM, why can't they afford to keep the toilets clean and working for their visitors? The city ""fathers"" should be ashamed. The Annenberg facility is located about a mile west, and is better, I am told.",BurghDoc
40,Pictursque,"Scenically it's beautiful. The beach is very wide with nice clean, golden sand so you can't ask for more than that. And if you like people watching it is brilliant place!",NUFCadl

50,Pretty Beach,"For the most part, Santa Monica Beach is safe & clean. (Near the Pier can get littered a bit with trash) Lots of walking, & the views are gorgeous. Great spot for picture taking.

50,Favorite place in LA,"We loved this place! the beach is clean, there is big waves and the beach is enormous! Fun to see people trying to surf. Great place.",Josianne D
50,BIg!!! Did I mention it's BIG?,"The walk from the street to the water is a trek because this is one big beach.Having said that it fills up right next to the water.It's best to head down the peer and exit onto the walkway to the beach so you don't have to walk the sand.The beach is elevated just before the water so it's best to sit close.Also, very windy here.Sun ....cold water.....view....what else could you want.The fruit vendors very good fruit for $6Have to do the beaches and this one has the couples/families.",Justmyopinion

Some deep deep stone steps and it was hard for some of my part.The beach was warm during the day, but got really old at night. See packing list below:Watch out for trash. Some came from the ocean city some was left by visitors.Warm water, but totally a splash area only because of the trash.The kids thought it smelled funny, do I put a little scented Vaseline under their nose just a tiny amount.There was only one shower we saw, and the line was about 50 families deep.Pack a jacket and pants for when the sun goes down. You will need it at the warf.",Shea S

40,Fun day at the beach with the family!!,"Easy access from the freeway, bit harder to get out at the end of the day. Good parking and bathrooms are about as expected for a public beach. Bummer that they restricted SUP'n on most of the beach after 12pm though.",palama8505

30,Would recommend going during the week,"A hot Sunday afternoon in the summer is not the best time to visit, I would recommend going during the week and getting there early to get a good spot. The bathrooms are filthy so show up ready to go and make a plan to clean up elsewhere at the end of the day. If possible, I would recommend parking and staying near the Anneburg Community Beach House.",iroamaround67801
40,4th of july visit,Nice wide beach. We visited on the 4th of July so it was really busy. If you go a littlebit further from the santa monica pier it gets alot quieter.,Marc B

40,Sands between the toes!,I love a beach and this beach has a nice backdrop of Santa Monica Pier. Overall beach was not too crowded and fairly clean. Parking was a little pricey.,Creative Mom
30,Quantity versus Quality,"Having had the good fortune to visit some of the best beaches around I would not rate Santa Monica as a particularly great beach but like the Gold Coast Beaches in Australia this beach is immense. It is massively wide and runs uninterrupted for miles upon miles but it's a flat as a pancake and no vendors offer shade umbrella's anywhere that we saw. If you like to play beach volleyball this is the beach for you, if however you like to walk along the beach and then settle under an Umbrella to cool down you won't find it here. The Beach is very clean and it is groomed everyday by a bunch of JCB's. It's still a nice place to go for a walk just don't get caught out in the midday heat.",BreezeRidge3
50,Beautiful beach along with an awesome pier.,"I came here to check out the view and beach and I got more than I bargained for. The beach was relatively clean and the waters were blue and cool. It will be kind of busy but not enough to be crowded. It's a very touristy spot, so expect to wait for some things.The pier is a whole attraction by itself, but it's worth noting because it's right on the beach and the place to go for food and drinks and more.Parking is a bit if a hassle if you don't know where you are going. Some folks WILL try to scalp you and try to make you pay 40$ for parking. Make it easy on yourself, park in the beach parking area. It's around 12$ and you're close to the beach and pier.",danielsalasw
50,Sand and Sun to your heart's delight.,"The 25 mile stretch of beach that includes Santa Monica's coastline is quite impressive. The beach itself is 300 yards deep from the Pacific Coast Highway to the crashing waves of the Pacific ocean. You can park on the paved beach lot right next to the Santa Monica Pier. You will never feel crowded because the Beach is big enough to accommodate the population of the entire city!. The sand is clean, the water is cold and the waves are big. A beautiful place to spend the day.",Dave C
50,"Beautiful ,clean and crowded","This wide stretch of beach is a must see in Santa Monica. Spend a whole day strolling the boardwalk just to look at people,skateboarders,bikers,sunbathers, and so on. There is always something fun to watch.

40,Always fun to visit the beach,Sit and stay a while. Smell the salt air and watch the birds fly the up drafts near the beach. Rent a boogie board and get into the water. You won't regret it.,J S
40,"The pier was fun, bright, and exciting.","Loved the pier. We got there a 10 p.m. and things were winding down. Couldn't eat at the local Tex-Mex restaurant because it was closed, so we had to eat a a restaurant we have at home. Beach is beautiful. A few homeless people sleeping right by the walkway made me sad so we bought them a burger and fries. It difficult to see so many homeless and ignore their plight. They may not be there during the day.",thumperrn
40,Great day out!,"My eleven year old and I visited recently and had a fantastic time at the pier. It was fun and catered for children of different ages. It was very busy, but you could easily move around. We had a great lunch at rusty's and this was an awesome lunch spot!",KristenD508

50,The View is absolutely breath taking,The beach was packed when I went but clean and beautiful. Lots of little league soccer tournaments going on at the time. Very relaxing place.,Satisfied526
50,Beautiful to walk along and relax!,We had a one day stop in LA and had a few places on our list to go. Santa Monica beach was one of the nicest. Very much enjoyed waking along the beach in the sun. It's well kept and clean and was busy without feeing unpleasant if that makes sense.,Alan H
40,"Beautiful beach and pier, but nothing special",The beach and pier area is lovely to walk around. Plenty of space on the beach and places to eat. The pier itself is lively but nothing special in terms of piers.,woodhf
50,"Wide beach, with beautiful views","Santa Monica Beach is so amazingly wide that it can accommodate a lot of people and still seem like it's almost empty. It sits below the Santa Monica mountains and the city of Santa Monica. It's split in two by the pier, which has a group of big rides that light up at night. There is a long bike/walking path that sits behind the beach. There are a couple of high-end hotels and a group of low end eating places and shops that you will pass as you walk the path. You can also walk up on the bluff overlooking the beach. There's paid parking on the bluff and in lots by the beach.",CaTraveler7777

40,Beautiful but not so clean,"had a few wonderful walks on this fun beach,the boardwalk is great carnival feel to it..but as we walked out on the beach I did stumble upon a syringe so be careful of where you step barefoot. Often drum circles that you can catch and a great view of Southern California coastlines",AC C
20,Not great.,There are better beaches in England and it's not a patch on a Caribbean beach. In fact it was pretty grim and not the beach we were expecting.,Stuart1

50,Great beach in California.,"Great place to sunbath and swim. Fantastic golden sand and plenty of space for privacy, etc.... Pretty tidy and clean and safe for swimming.",bart_thompson
30,Not an Aussie Beach,Its a very broad expanse of sand and has huge parking lots and the freeway right on the eastern edge so its noisy and has a severe lack of comfort (a lack of open privacy?). Beaches usually offer a quiter aspect with time to contemplate the sounds and sights of the ocean ...this beach is a bit brasher and less restful ......a bit like LA itself ...Australia on Steroids,Biztraveller15
50,Beautiful!,Spent a few hours on the beach and in the ocean. Was a nice clean beach without any litter or mess! There was lifeguard huts every 100 odd yards with lifeguards that were very on the ball and always had people's safety in mind. Also next to the pier so there's plenty of places to eat and drink and have some fun with the rides,Ben22p
50,Great beach,Lovely beach-if you can visit one beach in cali skip Venice and go to this one instead. Also lovely to walk along at night,Thedisman

50,"Great fun, Lots to do","We haven't been in the water here in a while but the beaches were clean and the water looked cleaner than I remember. Water temperature was good. One of the earliest Hot Dog on a Stick is here. You can rent bikes, buy boogie boards and watch musicians or big and athletes on ropes or rings. Just south of the pier are places for adults and monkey children to climb and swing. If you rent a bike, mornings are less crowded and gives everyone a chance to get used to riding, skating and dodging the pedestrians who sometimes cross the path without looking.",CindyZach
40,Fun,"Not as many places to get good food here, but fun to walk down the boardwalk and watch people bouncing on the bands, or balancing on each other like acrobats.",Sherry A
50,Great family day at the beach,"Staying near the airport, our family of four took the Big Blue Bus (only $1.25 and about 45 min ride) to Santa Monica for the day. We stuck our toes in the Pacific, walked the boardwalk, rented bikes from Sea Mist, drank fresh lemonade from Hot Dog on a Stick, and enjoyed happy hour drinks on the rooftop at Ristorante al Mare. We skipped the aquarium, as it didn't look very exciting and the kids didn't seem interested.",jnj2003
40,"Beautiful, clean and crowded","Route 66 ends at Santa Monica. And there is the Route 66 tourist centre at Santa Monica.The beach is beautiful especially at Sunset.There are a lot of food vendors and you get plenty of choice.The beach itself is clean.

40,Lovely large beach,"I'm not 100% sure what part of Santa Monica beach I am reviewing and photographed but it was quite stunning. Beautiful sand, great waves and parking with rest facilities, so it does have everything.

50,Sun and Water....great combo!,"Going to the beach is always soothing. Walking up and down the pier or riding your bike, skates or skateboard is a great place to enjoy yourself or time with the family. There are swings and play equipment for the children and for adults.

There are vendors up and down to purchase anything from. Take your time, stroll and just breath in the fresh air..",Jeane141
30,Typical Urban Beach,"California has thousands of miles of beaches and those in urban areas are simply the worse. Lots of people, some of whose haven't bathed in weeks. The beach in Santa Monica is no different. What distinguishes the Santa Monica Beach from others is its depth. One of the widest beaches I've ever seen.",Wineaux FromAlexandria
30,Ok. Good to tick off the list as seen,"Ok. Nice to have a look at how big the beach is ie wide. Weird how some houses are right on the beach. Pier is good. It's a pier with shops, food, bike hire etc and some amusement rides.",Bec P

There is a walk of about 150 yards from the road to the sea front, where you can place your towels.There is plenty of space to play frisbee but the sand is very hit and you need to wear shoes.There are better beaches with more character.",rob1london
50,Vast Beach With Lots To Do,"There is a lot of beach from the street to the ocean. I am from the east coast where the sand is hot but this sand you can walk barefoot to the ocean without a problem. The water temperature for me is cold since the waters by my beaches east coast are considerably warm. There is so much to do volleyball, parallel bars, balance beams and a whole lot more. It is a very fun area. Of coarse The pier is right there with all the fun it has to offer.",lizd3
50,Fun Time!,"We decided to make an afternoon trip on a Saturday. Thought it would be crazy, but it wasn't too bad. Sort of hard to park. It's $12 to park by the beach until sunset.

40,Huge wide and long beach.,"This beach is wider than most and is very long, going miles along the sweep of a beautiful bay. You can get up close to the water where it is a little more crowded or chill out all by yourself further back on the beach. Plenty of room and views for all.",Tony H

30,pretty but too cold to swim,"Santa Monica Beach is pretty as it's a bay where you can see from Malibu south to Palos Verdes. The beach is very wide and there is a bike & pedestrian path that run along the sand from Pacific Palisades in the North to Marina del Rey to the South. There is ample paid parking if you drive, and plenty of buses if that's your means of transport. There is even a new train where you can disembark and walk to the beach. This water is not warm. Although it's the Pacific Ocean, the water is cold most of the year, and it's pretty dirty. If you are going just to hang out on the sand, it's a lot of fun...some areas more crowded than others.",airbrush1212

50,Huge beach,"If you are out of shape you will likely be winded by the time you reach the water. This beach is DEEP and the sand is rather deep, so it takes some effort to get to the water.

As the beach where Baywatch was filmed, we were actually able to witness some of the lifeguards swimming out to save people that were caught in a riptide and swimming to far out in the water! The sand felt amazing on our feet and the water (though cold) was refreshing.",Andrew B
50,Outstanding,The beach was beautiful with miles of golden sand just what I imagined. Great places to eat and not far from places to go shopping,Wesley H
50,Go for it,"If you are spending time in Santa Monica Beach you are lucky. I used to live close by so is that cheating for me to rave about it all? The great thing about Santa Monica Beach is that it is packed with wonderful things to do. The Bike path is fun, the uncrowded beaches especially further north or south of the Santa Monica Pier. It is 3 miles from the Santa Monica Pier to the Venice Pier. When walking on the board walk you enter Venice Beach and you will feel the difference. The southern part of the Santa Monica Beach there are 6 Tennis courts and a wonderful place to play. From restaurants to people watching, roller blading it is a wonderful place. If you do the walk from Santa Monica Pier to the Venice Pier you will have passed through Venice and enter Marina Del Rey. At that point you will have arrived on Washington Blvd at the Venice Pier. I do like to group Santa Monica Beach, Venice Beach and Marina Del rey as a great Package deal. If you are bored in this area, there is something wrong with you. Enjoy.",Greg H

40,Great Beach if you Can't Make it to Zuma in Malibu.,"Santa Monica Beach is safe, clean and fun. Beware the tide, but for the most part swimming is safe and fun. The sand is lovely and you can walk to the Pier from the beach. Parking is for a fee and pretty convenient. Now, if you have time go to Zuma Beach in Malibu instead, but if you can only hit one beach while in Los Angeles, the SM Beach is great. Dogs are not allowed and the ticket is super expensive--sorry. Have a great time.",elizabethlascheid

Some of the help really need to be polished up, I have experienced some down right ignorant and arrogant staff in some hotels.Wheer I was staying at the #$%at the Pier I needed a coffee , sign in the foyer said free coffee I helped my self to some coffee and half way through it the Foyer attendant rudely said I have to pay I explained that the sigh said free , he replied but only in a paper cup!!! I was using a china cup.I slipped him some Australian two and one Dollar Gold coins and that was the end of it.The service didn't improve but the burnt coffee did .I often wonder what happened to the coins , did it go into the waiters pocket or did jot go into the coffers of the very old hotel with the obscure view?.",Tiapan

The scenic beach is very wide and clean, with volleyball nets set up and lots of trash receptacles available. There's a paved path along the beach that has designated areas for walking and biking (you can rent a bike). Public restrooms were available every 1/4 mile or so. Food is available at the pier or stands along the walkway. A playground and exercise equipment are located at ""Muscle Beach"" just south of the pier. It's a lovely beach with plenty to do. The pier has restaurants and an amusement park, and you can swim, fish, walk, bike, surf, play volleyball, or shop at nearby stores. (Note that pier attractions don't open til later in the day.)

40,Beat the crowds,Santa Monica Beach is wonderful for a long walk and mostly clean. It is important to check the beach ratings online for water quality as it is not always as clean as I'd like for swimming. It is very popular and can be lined with people and beach umbrellas on the weekends. As another person mentioned there are homeless people mostly around the pier. The farther away you get the more privacy you have. Walk north toward Malibu and enjoy the view.,MarilynLA

50,Great beach day,"Santa Monica is gorgeous...despite reading reviews that it was dirty, I saw zero trash nor did I see a bunch of homeless. I did notice the CHP ? Helicopter patrol the beach a few times for some reason, but the kids found it exciting. Water wasn't too cool to play in, sand was fun as always, but there's no shells or drift wood or big rocks to make the beach more interesting. If you want that stuff, head north to Malibu area beaches. We didn't really explore the pier since we were in the area doing Disneyland, but it looked pretty fun, albeit crowed. South of the pier there's workout areas and kids loved the long swings.",Eric S

30,Short vacation!,Visited here for a short vacation. Beautiful beach. Very crowded. There are many things for little kids to do. My kids prefer to play with sand & water.,Thuy Le
50,2 days on beach,"Spent 2 days on the beach this week. Absolutely recommend Santa Monica beach. Parking a bit pricey at $12 per day with no return. But cheaper alternatives available if they have spaces. Ideal as you just park up, hit the beach and if you need any facilities the iconic Santa Monica Pier has it all and is a short stroll away. Beach was clean and filled with all types of people. Felt safe under the watchful eye of the lifeguards.",JolanPW
20,Dirty,"It's right next to the pier so it should tell you it's one of the most dirty beaches in LA. But people keep going there. The water gets poor ratings, there's constantly things floating up from the beach, the sand is filled with garbage and cigarette butts, it's got birds flying over all the time etc. Stick to other beaches that aren't near a pier.",Bits58
40,Take it all in!,"I think Santa Monica itself is a must see, you can spend a day here waking the streets and also spending time down the beach. It's a really large well kept beach which is beautiful. If you have time do a bike ride between Santa Monica and Venice Beach to take it all in. A bit sad about all the homeless people that set up camp throughout the are though.",Josh_soph
50,Excellent town,Santa Monica is the place of memory's if you need some. The place is exquisite as well as picturesque. It is very clean and the restaurants are amazing. A town not to miss in LA. Cheers Lou from Australia,Loutorana1
40,Good for 3-4 hr afternoon with kids,"We went to this beach last weekend with 3 young kids. .1yr, 3yr and 4yr olds. Older ones made sand castles and we all had home made food, sandwitches.- parking is next to Beach, $12. We mistakenly parked bit far in mall where we paid less but had to walk 0.3 miles or so- pier seems good too, decent public restrooms on pier- look for sunny warm day to come, our stay was awesome with nice warn weather and no cold wind- beach is not very long, if it matters to you. Like i prefer to run on beach but this one was too short for that- we have not checked other LA beaches yet so cannot compare to venice or other beaches",M S
40,Finally visited the famous piee,"Parked at a meter on Washington and Ocean and walked to the pier. Nice stroll with interesting street performers along the way. The pier itself was pretty crowded but navagatable. Several options for dining and shopping (see review of ""Rusty's""). Also the aquarium (mainly for kids) is in the front of the pier. Walked to the end of the pier and peered around. Hazy day but mountains to the north were visible. Nice sea breeze as well. Wasn't on a bucket list, but since we were in SoCal for other reasons, we decided to kill a half a day here.",cnanrw
40,One Huge Beach!,This is a very large beach that should not be missed. Right at the PCH and the edge of Santa Monica where it meets the Pacific. Interesting pier worth a visit too.,yellowpixels
50,A great place for a walk,"Guys/Girls beware Hunk alert and SWIMSUITS. I personally go for the swimsuit action. This place has so much to see with the Pacific Ocean and yes sorry ladies NO disrespect, DAMN it is some good looking ladies in Santa Monica, CA. I personally enjoyed my day in this city. Good luck fellas, not recommended for you married guys.",Driver_316
30,Beach visit,The beach had a cool So Cal vibe but it was colder and foggier than I expected. I visited with my wife and 3 kids over Spring Break while we looked at colleges in the So Cal area.,jrcarragher
50,Beautiful serenity,This place makes you forget that there is a life beyond the beauty of the scenic landscape and the vast ocean blue. This was my first time to the Pacific and it was a treat. It is so beautiful here. The serenity of the waves and the laughter of those around d makes this for an escape from the real world but maybe this is the real world. You are in for a treat if you come to visit.,Jamie E
40,Nice....,"Lovely beach for the majority. Lovely interesting people beautiful sands but, when you hit the pier it is filthy. I only say this to make sure you don't let your child run ahead of you before you see the sign.The pier has lots of entertainment giving you the overall beach experience. The beach has volleyball courts and various activities to keep people occupied.",Katieleighfitz28
40,Acres of sand,"Looking to get lost in sea of sand? Santa Monica Beach is a good place to do it. If you want to wet a hook or cast a net, folks on the pier we pulling up all kinds of goodies.",Alohakane3

20,Didn't like it,"Visited during early morning and walked on down to Venice beach ... Did not like the feeling of either place .. So many homeless just camping , wondered what all the hype is about .. Something I guess anyone visiting would want to do but honestly lower your expectations.. Go for a walk then plan your day elsewhere",squiz62

50,Large Beautiful Beach,"Wide expansive beach. Unfortunately it can get cold and windy, so be aware of the weather. We went and it was windy and miserable. No one was on the beach, and the sand was giving us a free facial from the wind. Still, it was gorgeous and on a warm day I imagine it's just picturesque.",MiShellery
50,Fabulous beach,"Warm sand, classic life guard stands, great bike trails, and excellent proximity to the Santa Monica Pier!",Faith G
40,"Wide open space, but no surf","It was cooler weather, so to see the poor surfers in their wetsuits, waiting for hours for a wave was a bit tragic. The beach is so long and wide I can't see how they would ever get much of a wave.",KimTherese
40,Huge Beach - well cared for,"It seems that a lot of effort is being made to ensure a positive experience for guests - raking the sand, long walk way, activities and more. Definitely a fun place to visit. However, many homeless folks along the walk way - they keep to themselves, but as a visitor, it seems that Santa Monica isn't doing much to help this community.",spete88070
50,Don't miss this classic California experience.,"Large, beautiful beach with fun pier and great bike path. Inexpensive parking. Easy to rent bikes or skateboard to enjoy the long stretch of bike trail next to the ocean.",BethNBK
50,Vast Beach with loads to do,"This beach really impressed me as it offered loads to do, for all ages and had lots of water sport activities. Beach was very clean and I noticed that the beach was constantly patrolled which was good to see and would benefit families with young children.",David R
50,A must see if visiting SoCal!,"There's much to read online about Santa Monica. What you may not see is that the beach is an upscale extension of Venice beach.Between the pier, 3rd Street Promenade and the beach itself there's a full weekend of fun for the family! Definitely rent beach cruisers and ride to Venice Beach and Marina del Rey.Sun, shop, dine, surf, people watch and enjoy!",Brian M

50,Breathtaking,What's not to like. A beautiful view and a spiritual walk at sunset. Although there are a lot of people out the beach is so large you can find your own space. enjoy.,Monishay
50,Everything Venice Beach is NOT,"This beach is beautiful of course, but when you go to the pier or the shops there's not fortune tellers or homeless in your face. The police have obviously selected this area to keep clean and push all that element south. Knowing what I know now I would never go to Venice.",lyle7692
40,Great Beaches,We were lucky enough to be right outside a beach with great surfs if you like surfing. We went to Malibu beach which was spectacular. Well worth the visit.,Demetris M

50,One of the world's great beaches,"Santa Monica Beach is, by far, one of the world's great beaches. Maybe not for surfers, but for families and sunbathers, it's ideal. The sand is soft and the actual beach area is huge! Volleyball nets are everywhere and the kids have a great time. Plenty of parking both in pay lots and street (if you can find it).",jtlerman
20,Too commercialized to be appealing anymore,"Line of waiting cars to enter, $6 to park, overcrowded pier and associated restaurants. The majority of dining facilities were cheap chain places or 'fair food', and all had almost an hour wait at 2:45 in the afternoon on a weekday. Multitudes of noisy video games in a dark tented area.The Santa Monica Pier used to have some charm and uniqueness, now it's really no different than most traveling carnivals in a strip mall parking lot, I'm sorry to say.",julie3607
40,"Busy, crazy but great people watching","Because the bike path and pedestrian walkway goes for miles, this is a beach trail that you can go almost forever. It can be super busy on a weekend, but that's fun too if you are not put off by ""all kinds.""",expectquality1942
50,Great way to spend the day,"We went here for one reason: to relax. The beach is wide enough to lie down, do nothing, chat with friends, go people watching. Of course you could always go swimming, have a small picnic or play beach volleyball. The area is large so it wont feel too crowded even if there's a lot of people.",Cybill Y
20,Dirty,"Beautiful beach but the amount of trash is very hard to take. The beach is lined with trash cans end to end, but people really don't seem to care or use them. Fines should be issued on the spot!! People just abandon all of their trash and don't even bat an eyelash.",Julie B
50,Gorgeous Day at the beach,"My family spent last Saturday afternoon at the beach and loved it. Weather was perfect, not too crowded and a great way to enjoy the beautiful southern California sun.",mrstats69

40,Popular Beach,"Beautiful, popular beach. Very impressed with how many different things there were to do there. Very well watched by the authorities. Great place to spend a sunny day.",theheatonfamily
40,The beach was pumping,We visited on Easter Sunday and even though it was not warm enough for us to swim heaps of people were in the water with some still fully clothed. The beach was really beautiful and actually quite busy which makes be believe that on a hot day you would probably be fighting for a spot. I loved that it was colorful and had a carnival atmosphere - just wish it had been warmer.,20grace13
10,Sad times for America - british perspective,"I was utterly depressed when I arrived in Los Angeles for the first time (from UK) :-(. The scale of homelessness is beyond belief! British people believe me!! This is the colour of capitalism.This beach was lined with homeless men along with their shopping trolleys stuffed with clothes,furniture and dirty recyclable bottles/plastic bags spilling from the top. Most of these men were mentally unwell. They were either lying under the ""hollywood"" palm trees drunk/high/soaked in urine or talking to themselves or poking around bare handed in bins looking for resalable garbage or food. The stench of sun dried urine and faeces eminates from the "" promenade"" before u hit the beach. The fear of being pricked by a used needle or stepping on human excrement or the thought of finding a "" floater"" in the sea runs through your mind along side images from Baywatch ( yes it was shot on this beach). I was scared! I could not enjoy the sand or sea with vulnerable mentally unwell men lying comatosed around me while people walk around like all is normal. And yes there were rich well to do people running around amongst all this. The cafes are like pound store equivalent for food and the toilets make glastonbury look ok!I am very well travelled and I have never seen such a disgrace in a developed country shame on you america! The american people dont know they are being played! It made me proud to be british ( which aint always the case!). Would love to hear other brits experience please!!!!",Nolaughingmatter

40,Nice Beach,"There is a lot of sand on this beach which is good cause it can get pretty crowded. So, if you don't need to be right by the ocean, you can find a quieter place to lie down. It's clean & if it's not a smoggy day, you have a beautiful view of the mountains.",Maxxxines
50,Classic Pier,"This is such an iconic place. Because of all the movies it's been in it's larger than life. It's so fun to stroll around the pier, and beach. There's always lots to look at and be entertained. It's so close to downtown LA it's very convenient.",Carol B

40,Nice beach,The beach is very well kept. It was cleaned daily and there are ample trash cans to keep it clean. I would give it another star if there public swings for young children and people weren't able to set up camp. They made it a little unsightly .,rdodge2

40,beautiful,"What a beach. So different from Australian beaches but has it's own uniqueness. You can get worn down walking across the sand - what a distance and so strange to have carparking right on the beaches.What I loved most is the atmosphere with the buskers, the street performers and those trying their luck on the equipment - gosh there are some truly amazing people out there! The sunsets were stunning and what a treat to be in that part of the world. Be sure to take the time to talk to some of the homeless there - they all have a different story and it is very much part of the town so ignoring it isn't an option - why wouldn't you want to share a meal with a stranger anyways.

50,Best Food in Mammoth,"I have been a skier for decades spending many winter days in Mammoth. Generally, I am underwhelmed by the restaurant choices in town. Then, I tried Jimmy's. It is located upstairs above the Red Lantern. The room is beautifully decorated. The service is impeccable. Not only did we have an excellent server, but the manager and the chef stopped by to say hi. But most importantly, the food was excellent. I had scallops which were plump and moist and deliciously seasoned. Every one was happy with their meal and all four of us ordered different entrees. The restaurant is slightly pricey. Dinners were in the $25-38 range, but well worth it.",Annette M

Safe also as there are lifeguards dotted along the beach.If you're not into swimming, it doesn't matter - the beach is perfect for a nice walk, jog or just pure relaxation and laying out.There are different outdoor exercise areas located near the Pier. And, again, if you're not in to them, it doesn't matter, there are plenty of people that just sit back and watch other people do their thing as some treat their work-out almost as a show!But, the most amazing thing of all about the beach and, a memory that will never leave me is the watching the sunset from the beach - it's absolutely spectacular.

40,Lots of sand,I grew up in L.A. and went to Santa Monica often. It used to be a sleepy beach town and not the overdeveloped tourist mecca it is now.When I was a kid I thought all beaches had tons of sand. It wasn't until I saw other beaches until I realized Santa Monica has about 10 times more sand then anywhere else. The good things about the beach are 1. The view is beautiful especially at sunset. 2. The bike path is great. 3. The pier is still fun and the only 1 of its kind left in the state. 4. Lots of volleyball courts. 5. Muscle beach. 6.

I snuck onto a lifeguard's tower for a cheeky photo! ;-D I was impressed with the cleanliness (bins lined up along what i would think would be the tide line), and everybody looked like they were enjoying themselves.

50,Clean & beautiful beach,Spent the day in the first week of December 2015 at Santa Monica Beach & the Pier. What a beautiful place to visit & so much nicer than Venice Beach. The beach itself was very clean. The water was crystal blue. Although we didn't swim as it was winter we did walk along the soft sand and the water was cold and fresh. It wasn't crowded at all and afterwards we went across to the pier to eat and browse around all the souvenir shops. There is something for everyone there.

Pier was beautiful in the day and at night. A must see. Felt safe day and night. Did walk down to Venice Beach. Wonderful walk, but wasn't impressed once I got there. Not like Santa Monica at all.

It's a vast expanse of sand leading down to the ocean with a good bike path running through it.

10,Dirty and dangerous,The place is dirty and full of homeless. The entire place smells like urine and there's trash everywhere. I wouldn't recommend going inside of the water either as I saw trash all over the sand. There's also lots of crazy people which I don't recommend if you are going alone. I was expecting to see the same images I saw on pictures all over Internet but what I saw was just a place that I won't be back again.,Carol K
40,Great beach,"The beach here is long and wide. There is a bike path that goes all the way from Pacific Palisades to Redondo pier. Santa Monica beach is much cleaner than next door Venice beach.

The beach itself is about average with a nice view of the mountains along the coast. There were many homeless people out and about in the park and on the actual beach and near the pier.

It had been cloudy and mild that day, so the beach wasn't crowded at all, but I'm sure that's not always the case.The boardwalk is a great little walk. I wish we'd had more time to go into the city and walk around there, though. We only drove down for the day, and spent all of our time in the water.",ekann01

Also a great place if you have kids that need to run around a bit and let go after having to behave themselves all day ;-)",Kiwigirl341
20,Walk on beach,Walked this one day with my family including baby. Sketchy crowd...several drunk men hanging out but didn't bother us besides s few comments. Much better than Venice beach.

30,"Nice enough, but nothing special....","There's an ocean and sand, so that makes it a beach. They've got a bike path, too, but it is inundated with skaters, strollers, joggers and so on -- not much fun for bikes unless it is early morning or late in the afternoon. Of course, the ""I'm the most important person in the world"" attitude of most West Siders makes the bike path even less enjoyable (how about NOT walking five abreast, taking up both lanes in both directions, people?).All in all, worth a brief visit, but there are other beaches in and around LA that are so much nicer....",Waveskiguy
30,Average beach,Very overcrowded! So hard to relax on the beach when it is crazy busy and you feel like people people are in your personal space. Great to go there and see what it's all about. Least I can say I've been there now!,kozmohiggins
50,"Perfect way for travelers to enjoy the air, water and sand","We travel out to CA every year for a long Thanksgiving week. This beach is the perfect place for our children (8 and 9) to get some exercise and to enjoy the air, water and sand. It's close to so many great hotels, restaurants and activities. The kids enjoy the traveling rings, racing the waves, the balance beams, etc. It's just a great place to watch people let along exercise!!!",Y2403JRstevend
40,Great Beach,Santa Monica is one of the great beaches in the L.A. area. even though it is a touristy place it still isn't as crowded as you would think and at night the pier gives a different vibe with the carnival all lit up.,aggietraveler1976
40,Something for everyone,"The beach is really nice. You can find something for everyone, or just people watch. They have plenty of things around the beach to do and it's a great place to just play in the ocean.",J M
30,Great beach,I have fond memories of visiting Santa Monica pier beach some 12 years ago in the summer. It was still worthwhile visiting in the winter - the beach is kept wonderfully clean and 'groomed'. The sands are a light golden colour and the view across the vast and empty Pacific Ocean is calming. Don't know if they still pattern the sands by pulling large imprinted concrete rollers.,Gavin H
40,The LA beach,"While it's not my favorite beach for swimming and sunning, Santa Monica is the one I show visitors because it's so quintessentially California. The pier is a little less tacky than it used to be, and there are things to see and do a few blocks away at the 3rd Street shops.",sabrinayb
40,less crowded than venice,Most people in Santa Monica on the 3rd Street Promenade or on the Santa Monica Pier good news for that is that along the beach there's not as many people in Santa Monica most people are in Venice,Stephanie C

50,So many ways to spend your time on a beach..,Santa Monica beach is one of my favorite place to spend my time with family. Awesome 35 mile bike path is really good if anyone like cycling. There are so many activities around the area. pacific park and the Aquarium at the pier also good place to spend the time.parking at the pier is expensive unless you want spend the entire day. I recommend to park at the public parking structures and walk down to the beach.,CharmLA
50,Best Beach in LA!,"Santa Monica Beach has to be my favourite in LA. I have been there a couple of times. The sand is soft, golden and warm. It is also so big that you shouldn't get bothered by anyone. Would recommend!",SN1
50,The Rings are by the Pier,"My daughter wanted to try the Traveling Rings here. In fact, she wanted to do this more than go to Disneyland so we came here without really knowing where they were located. We parked at Santa Monica pier and I figured if we rented bikes, we would eventually locate them. Well it turns out that the outdoor ""gym"" area is right underneath the pier 5 mins walk towards Venice Beach! We did end up riding down to see the skate park and basketball courts but returned to the Rings.During the weekdays, there are mostly tourists with no clue about how to do. But by afternoon, the regulars come out and flaunt their stuff. It's great just to watch them. They are extremely friendly and kind. One guy made sure my daughter had access to the communal talc powder for her hands. One woman taught her some simple moves. For my daughter, it was indeed much more fun than Disneyland.There are hanging bars and ropes and stuff. We were told on the weekends, there are crowds of acro yoga people and the line-up for the Rings goes on forever. So we lucked out dropping by on a weekday afternoon.As for the beach and pier, I prefer Newport Beach. The restaurant we ate over there was far superior than here. There were no shops at the SM Pier, but just along the way to Venice Beach which as others noted, seedy and definitely less wholesome. We didn't do the rides but noted that they weren't open until later in the afternoon when there were more people.",chakimama
50,The end of route 66!,One of the best beach in the world. The end of route 66! Many scene of BayWach were shooted here.Near by there is the Promanade on 3rd street a pedestrian area with a lot of shops and street artist. Great a Christmas with a giant tree and ice skating ring. Great wheater. Near by the pier where the route 66 end.Over there there is also an entertaiment park.,divinaRome
30,Not much here but lovely deep beach,What can I say. It's a beach. Nice and deep. Was empty (early December). Not much there in the way of places to eat or drink. There's a Perrys to stop at for lunch or snack. Plenty of crazies here between venice beach and santa monica pier. There is a muscle beach but don't get it confused with venices muscle beach. A walk of about a mile between santa monica pier to venice beach which is a lot livelier.,AndyHouse
50,fun for all ages,It had an amazing atmosphere of music and so many fun activities for young to old were available and friendly locals. The beach was a beautiful view from many delicious food serving restaurants.,strawberryipie

40,Crowded still beautiful,I dont like too much of a crowd on a beach bit would make an exception to this one. The crowd kind of increased the charm of this already beautiful beach with the mountains in the backdrop. Took a long walk during the sunset and loved it.,sriramagrawal
40,Best beach in LA,The beach is so good. It has a wide & long cycle & jogging track widespread on the start of the beach there is pier near by where you can buy drinks & food the beach is so good & peaceful. Must visit in afternoon & do not forget to witness the sunset it's truly amazing.,Sagar S
40,Walk around Santa Monica Beach,I walked back and forth this beach in late fall. It was quite windy and chilly that morning so I kinda missed the best experience. I would like to go there again earlier in summer when you have better chance for good weather.,Timo_FIN76
50,Sandy beach,So much space on this beach. People were swimming in the sea in November I was wishing I had my swimsuit with me. Great for all ages. Easy to park the car and travel to.,Nomad5522
40,Enjoy the Californian athmosphere,"This is a must do in California. You've seen it in the movies, don't miss out on the real thing. Liked the combination of show-off condo's and locals, mixed with tourists (lot of American ones by the way). And mixed with basketballing men, girls on skates and surfdudes on the beach. Nice!",Hanshja

50,Rent a bike and drive to venice,I rented a bike and drove from Santa Monica to Venice and the canals. It is a beautiful 2 hours ride and you can rent bikes everywere for about 15-30$ depending on the model you want. It is really an amaizing ride and I will do it again on my next trip to LA,3448483georgemcfly
50,Awesome happening place.,"This place is full of life ! The beach is immaculately clean and the sea is quite warm.The pier is the centre of entertainment with so much to do although the rides aren't that cheap. The boardwalk is so busy with bikes,skateboards,roller skates or just joggers.Bikes can be hired for the half or full day at a reasonable price complete with safety helmet and security chain.There are plenty of shops,bars,restaurants and cafés all along the beach front where you can buy almost anything.",sedgy22

50,Vibrant versatile beach,"Santa Monica beach is one of my favorite beaches in the world!!! When I was a teenager it was an excellent place to play volleyball and go bodysurfing. Over the years I continue to enjoy running, walking, swimming & bicycling here. It is one of the best walking beaches! I always look forrward to my walks from Ocean Park to Venice & back. Morning coffee in Venice is always a welcome treat. I have often seen dolphins swimming at this beach. There are many lovely seabirds & seagulls too. This beach is the beach I call home",Gulbe

40,A great safe beach,"Wonderful wide stretches of sand so plenty of personal space. Always patrolled, look for flags on lifeguard boxes, and generally sea is safe. Toilets and facilities near the boardwalk. If parking, no problem through the week but can be popular at weekends. Plenty of food options on and near the pier.",Emanpee
30,Beach OK,If you're from NZ or Australia then don't come here for the beach experience. It's fine if you're being a tourist just to say you've been there and very close to the pier. Did I swim here? Not with the pollution and population levels here - you'd be mad!!,kapiti2014
40,"There Are Beaches that I Prefer, But SM Beach is Fun and Pretty","It's a pretty beach, but not as pretty as some. It can be crowded, especially on holiday weekends. The pier is fun and you can take a long walk down to Venice Beach for a little ""weirdness"". Riding your bike is a nice way to do it. SM beach is also pretty close to the 3rd St Promenade, so you can walk to it easily. You can also walk along the pathways near the beach and look out at the ocean. It's a nice area, although there are a lot of homeless people at times. I seem to run into movie productions nearly every time I'm walking there. I do enjoy ultimate frisbee on the beach. The sand is always seemingly clean, but the water is always too cold for me to go swimming, even in the summer. Make sure you bring some kind of shoes (flip flops) because the sand is very hot in the summer and you'll regret not having something between your feet and the sand.",Outofdodge_10

50,Iconic beach---it's why you come to Santa Monica,"Iconic beach that’s big and wideSurf that’s gentle and mild--to strong and wild depending on the swellLocal flavored areas from Bay Street (dogtown & z-boys) to Sorento (real volleyball) to state beach and the palisades crew of beach volleyball.(Whatever happened to the sorento identity—was that only in the 70’s?)Water is warmish or coldish water depending on the seasonWater that’s sorta clean—of course, avoid after the rainsBeach and sand can be trashy after warm sunny day…Lots of trashcans and recycle bins---Use them!Gotta love the beach, love your beach, love our beach!",Summerasalifestyle

40,Beach was nice,"I expected the pier to be larger or more things on it? Don't know why. But it was nice and watching people fish off the pier. The beach was great too, being from Australia I've seen better but it's the atmosphere that does it!",Alannap10
50,Favorite,This is my favorite Southern California beach (childhood memories make me biased). Very fun hangout. Not far from Malibu.,Elizabeth A
50,The big american beach,"A long, really long beach kissing the ocean, a path for bikes and rollers, a space for body builders, just the ultimate image of southern california.....",Paul R
40,Good Walk/Run,"There is a designated walk way along the beach, which makes the experience nice. Pedestrians have their own side walk for about 2 miles, starting from the pier to the north, then it is shared path between bikes and runners. In fall (early Nov), it's nice to walk around, when it's not hot anymore. From the pier to pacific palisades, it is about 5 miles one way. Recommend to use sunblocks but insect repellent is not needed :)",Rachelle W
40,Beach day,The beach was beautiful and well manicured. A lot of people were exercising (jogging/roller blading/bike riding) on the wide concrete sidewalk. There were several homeless people and shacks near the edge of the sand.,Mark L
50,Ideal spot for a nice afternoon,The beach is very wide and long. You could walk for miles or spend a lazy afternoon laying on the sand watching the waves and people go by. Lots to eat nearby.,Luv2travel_RS
50,Great beach!,"Enjoyed this beach more than nearby Venice Beach. It wasn't too crowded, the sand was very clean, and seemed to be free of vandals. Left our bag of belongings while we went to the water without any fear of anything being stolen. Pairs well with the Pier for a fun afternoon",Cody C
20,Dirty,Run down and trashy and dirty. Skip this beach and go to Zuma Beach in Malibu-just down the road--much better beach.,AnnieTigers
50,Fantastic!,"A beautiful beach, with miles of beautiful clean white sand. Clearly popular, the beach goes for miles and there were people everywhere.With the pier and café and shopping streets nearby it was a really rocking place.Plenty to do if you don't want to go in the water, volley ball and other activities available.One of those spots you can spend as long as you like. We had a few hours wandering the beach and pier and loved it. If you're loving the water you may just want to chill all day.",KiwiKerry53
50,Loved it,"Much quieter beach where you can have your own space and lay out a towel. We left our bag with wallets, phone and camera on the beach when we went for a swim and felt quite safe in doing so.",ClaireKing92
40,Good time cycling around,"We like to rent bikes and just cycle along the beach from Santa Monica up to Venice Beach or beyond. The weather was exceptional and made for a relaxing, fun time with family. We did stop to take a dip in the ocean by the pier, but i would definitely recommend finding a better beach spot for cleanliness, which isn't too difficult--we were just being lazy.",Mansum
50,Lovely Beach,"Santa Monica beach is lovely. It has a very relaxing feel to with, along with a number of shops and entertainment options nearby. I was surprised at just how big the distance between the beginning of the beach to the water was!",wilch303
50,Really great beach!,"We enjoyed this beach -- specifically the section not too far from the Santa Monica Pier. Big and clean, it has waves that attract paddle boarders, a few surfers and those who like to boogie board. However, the water is definitely manageable enough for swimmers, waders and families. A paved bike path offers lots of fun for walkers, skaters and two wheel enthusiasts!",Lin M
50,Stunning,Huge beach with loads of room. Really good walk/ run/cycle (lots of rentals too)/ roller blade... tracks too. Could have stayed forever!,jmm73
50,Just lovely,A really lovely deep beach. Enhanced by its proximity to Santa Monica pier and all that has to offer. Car parking seems reasonable as well. Much nicer than Venice Beach.,frank19452015
40,What you see is what you get! Tons of sand!,Good fun for everyone in the family and so large that even on busy days you can find lots of places to sit or put out your towel. Be careful though of the water if the breakers are large. I would be careful with small children. Day we were there they were doing a little surfing. Probably OK for beginners as waves not that large and run not very long; but I am not a surfer! Beach and water is a fair distance from the parking lot so be prepared for a walk.,Ed G M
50,Love this place,"The beach is clean although it has lots of people (not swimming). There were big waves when I was there and I enjoyed swimming. The water was warm. I can say I took a quick dip in the Pacific Ocean, yes! Had a picture taking at the end of Route 66. I felt safe when I was there bec there were lots of police patrols on sight.Towels are expensive, the cheapest is USD 20. So pls bring your own towel when you visit this place. Don't be like me, unprepared bec I thought I will be there for sightseeing but the water was so inviting. No regrets at all.",Stella R
10,Another filthy place!,"Very dirty with pigeons everywhere! As a tourist, I was expecting something different...maybe my expectations were too high. However, I definitely will not be back anywhere near that place!",Serena A

50,Road Trip,My hubby and I stopped here during our road trip and was very pleased that we did this is a lovely beach. I paddled my feet in the Pacific Ocean and it was amazing the sun was beating down and the water was lovely and warm.,Hebe_7
50,Nice large beach with beautiful views.,"We were here in March so not many people on the beach and the water was too cold, but I think the Pacific is always a bit frigid, even down south in LA. Some beautiful views from the beach of the Santa Monica coast.",Harring10
50,"Great beach, clean, fun","We went to Santa Monica Beach at the Annenberg Community Beach House, and it was great. We had to pack a bunch of stuff down to the beach (with the stuff for the kids and for lunch, etc.) and there was a path basically all the way down to the water, which made it so nice. The waves were also not too crazy, so the young kids had a lot of fun. They also had soccer standards and volleyball nets, though we didn't use them.",Buckcade
40,One of the best beaches in southern California,"Santa Monica beach is a great beach for a multitude of reasons. Not only is the surrounding area absolutely beautiful, there's a virtually unlimited amount of things to do all within walking distance. The Third Street Promanade which is a ten minute walk is lined with unique stores and great indoor/outdoor restaurants and cafes as well as a movie theatre. On top of that there's usually live entertainment, usually music, at any given time to enjoy and you stroll the street. The beach itself isn't usually overly crowded and it's kept quite clean. It offers volleyball nets and has food stands and public washrooms. An added bonus is the Santa Monica Pier which extends out into the ocean and also has live entertainment, food stands, rides and shops. Another highlight is the weather which, even during the colder months the temperatures are fairly comfortable and it's usually always sunny.",Joe S
50,Fantastic,"A very large clean beach with good lifeguard coverageBaywatch here we come, sun is shining sea is cool what more could you need",Fred S
30,Love this beach,I grew up going to this beach. There is always something going on around here. Enjoyment totally depends on the day you go. Early mornings are nice people are running and walking. However holidays and weekends require real planning. It gets very crowded. (if you like that sort of thing),ShelleyTelly
40,Beach Rides Entertainment Restaurants,"Great safe and clean environment for family. Parking in the pier's lot is $12 for the day. If disabled free. Great shops , restaurants and rides and games for kids and youth at heart. Can walk to Venice Beach but a distance. If you get tired there is a metro car seats 5 you can ride back free. Just ask vendors they will direct you. It's a hidden perk provided.",Jaynee C
50,Beautiful beach,If you want to experience the LA lifestyle you need to spend a day on the beach/pier at Santa Monica. Clean beach with lots of places to eat close by. The weather is amazing! You can also walk from here to Venice beach further down the coast,Joe C

50,Loved it!,"First time ever coming here, my family and I had a great time even though we showed up late in the day...the pier has so much to see, especially the entertainers...the beach was a blast, water was just right to get in and get wet, and it was super convenient having vendors walking back and forth selling umbrella shades, wake boards, toys for the kids, fruit, and ice cream...cant wait to go back again!",Ernesto R
50,Glorious,A wonderful expanse of inviting sandy beach with that great cycle path.It was beautiful weather and this brought out the crowds.,DavidG897
50,Very impressive beach,The really outstanding feature of this beach other than of course its size is its cleanliness .... I can safely say that i did not see a scrap of litter on this no smoking beach .... well done Santa Monica,Mike R
40,Plenty of room to relax,"We had a brief visit to the beach. We found it to be free of litter, and this was probably due to the fact that there was a row of bins, with one roughly every 50 yards in the middle of the beach.There were a lot of people at the beach including couples, young families and groups of people surfing, but it didn't feel crowded and there was plenty of space. The sand was okay, it felt a bit rough with gravel in but sitting on a towel wouldn't be noticeable (we forgot to take one).A relaxing place to gather your thoughts and people watch. There was a little shop/stall just near the beach entrance where we bought water and ice creams for reasonable prices.",Pip-F1
50,Great beach for families,"Not difficult to get in and out of, parking was handy and reasonably priced. Beach was very well maintained, and the view was very nice. Crowd was more ""family friendly"". Waves were a blast to play in once you get used to the cold water (we are from Texas). Loved it, and would love to go back.",Lance P
40,Pretty big,"Santa Monica Beach is pretty large. Around the pier there are some services likes restaurants, volleyball courts, rolling tracks, etc. The beach itself is famous but we have hundreds better in Spain, so go just for the fun of being there.",Jac-and-Jek

40,Beautiful beach with lots of people,"Spent the day at the beach with my sister. It was a beautiful day in October, near 80 degrees. There were a lot of people at the pier, running, and riding bikes, but not too many sunbathers, which was nice. There was plenty of open sand. The waves were high, so we were getting sprayed a bit where we were sitting, which was also nice.",Christina D
30,Nice Beach But.....,The beach was nice and clean but this area especially the pier is very unappealing and rundown. There are homeless people laying around the grassy areas and you see all of this walking to the beach and pier.,Lisa S
50,Santa Monica Beach,"Fantastic sandy beach. Absolutely huge and never seemed crowded. Lots to see and do - including volleyball, children's play area, cycle or go-kart riding plus water activities such as para-scending, surfing etc. Beach is very clean, dog friendly and a very sociable place to be.",Paula H
50,One of the nicest beaches I have been to,"Okay, so after visiting Santa Monica Pier, the kids wanted to go to the beach. It was really nice!! They had people walking up and down the beach selling fruit, chips, and even beach umbrellas at cheap prices. $20 for a nice beach umbrella or you could rent it for $10 for 4 hours. However, the vendors only take cash, so make sure you bring some if you want to keep your kids entertained. They even sell cute little sand buckets and sand toys for the kids. The beach itself was gorgeous. We came down to the beach from the pier and the Veterans for Peace group have a really thought-provoking exhibit on the way to the beach. It was interesting for the adults - probably not for the kids, though. The beach itself was clean and trash free and the tide came up nice and close. The beach was sloped so instead of walking down to the water, you had to go down a tiny hill. I think it was to prevent the tide from washing the whole beach away. Overall, a great time was had by all. Now, if you need a regular shower, make sure you go to the OTHER side of the pier and they have some there. Otherwise, they just have the standard foot and minimal showers leading to the beach.",Sean Ryan

50,Sand for miles at Santa Monica Beach,"Always a great place to go for a walk at sunrise and sunset, Santa Moncia beach is simply a refreshing oceanside destination of the endless Pacific Ocean vista, the Santa Monica Mountains and the birds, seals, dolphins and whales cruising along.",Tom R
50,"Great L.A. beach, Not pretentious like Malibu or O.C. beaches, this is the People's Beach","Park in the big lot just north of the pier is easiest. Flat rate is $10 I think. You can spend the whole day here on the beach. The touristy pier is worth a stroll but there are better places to eat along the strand toward Venice. The walk on the strand to Venice and back is well wroth it. Better on a bicycle (rentals available all around pier) Leisurely the walk will take you about 40 minutes each way. Great cafes and restaurants as you enter Venice with all the wacky vendors near Muscle Beach and more eats along Washington Blvd at Venice Pier. The Whaler has a great deck with nothing between you and the ocean. Food not great but good place for a Bloody Mary mid stroll. If you do eat back in Santa Monica the pier food is mostly chains. Mexican joint at the end has mediocre food but great view and good margaritas. If you want a good old school burger and the best chili fries get a pitcher of Heineken and some grub at local legend Duke's Surf Cafe at the base of the pier underneath the carousel on the strand, Green awning.",kimo213
40,A Fun Beach,"This is a fun and popular beach. It is very deep and there is a good walk to get to the water. It is also adjacent to the Santa Monica pier, so you might want to stay longer and visit there, too.",Samuel M
20,Overrated beach,We wanted to be close to LAX due to our departing flight time but I wish we would have gone further north. The beach was filled with litter and the water was very dirty/green. The pier was fun for people watching for a bit but as the monolithic gap between the homeless and wealthy class of the locals and visitors began continues to widen we it found the people watching more depressing than fascinating. The morning of our flight we handsome time to drive up coast to see the breathtakingly landscapes and my ch less populated areas between Santa Monica and Ventura (where we had to turn around to get to the airport). I'm sure the economic gap is just as severe north of SM but it's much cleaner and less populated.,hmcmn

40,Nice Beach,"This beach was a great place to spend the day with our family. Our 6 month old enjoyed the sand and watching the waves. The day we were there was beautiful. The beach has pretty fine sand, there was a lot of trash though. They have a nice board walk that gets you pretty close to the water and a place to rinse off when you are done. We used the parking right off the beach, which cost $12 for the day. It was convenient to go to the pier and beach from there. We even walked up and over the freeway to hit a couple places for happy hour. This is one of the better beaches I have been to in Southern California.",AshleySchulte
40,Great beach,"Santa Monica beach is one of the better beaches that I have visited in the LA area.

50,"Sand, Surf, Sun","Ocean Park Beach is the best. It is one mile south of the pier, Station 26.I have boogie boarded each summer for years. The waves are small tomedium, and they break out a distance to get a good ride. The beach itselfis wide with plenty of space for your umbrella, etc. Great view of the SantaMonica mountains too. No rocks in the ocean.",busybeaks16

50,"Nice place to be, amazing sunset.","This place is fantastic for anything you may want to do, exercising, eating or having just a nice time. The parking lot is nuts, 12 dlls for the whole day.

50,California Dreamin,"Ok so maybe this isnt the best beach in the world and you'll probably never find me in the water and I hate how crowded it gets here, I must admit that there are so many things that are great about Santa Monica Beach.First, when I think of California beach towns, THIS IS IT! You have the casual and energetic atmosphere, gorgeous sunsets over the Pacific, stunning views of the Santa Monica Mountains, easy access of PCH, proximity to the Santa Monica Pier and 3rd street Promenade, beach volleyball, the ORIGINAL Muscle Beach, rollerbladers and dog walkers along the 26 mile bike path, corndogs from Hotdog on a Stick...and you never know when you'll catch a TV show or movie being filmed!OH AND THE WEATHER!

40,Awesome place but limited public amenities,Went from Venice Beach to Santa Monica by bus. Loved the vibe of the place but found it very difficult to find public amenities here. Ended up being allowed to use a restaurants rest room. luckily it was a healthily restaurant with awesome fresh made juices so it was a win win situation for me!

30,Good beach,Visited beach and pier early evening and it was very busy on a Tuesday. The beach is massive and very wide and the pier is worth a stroll with a small area devoted to rides. Not much else happening on the pier with the usual expensive drinks and souvenirs and limited food available. Best thing was watching the sun going down. Parked on the pier but expensive.,610georged
40,Santa Monica,"Was beautiful, and I enjoyed it very much. I think that the beach was well kept, and the pier was just a bit overcrowded. Worth going to see",Patty F
40,beach is beach,"We hired bikes to ride up to Venice Beach, good time but just remember to take your credit card, if coming from Hollywood using public transport try not to go there through peak hours as I think the lady walking beat us back to Hollywood that afternoon.

50,What a beautiful stretch of beach,It is clean and beautiful. I just wanted to jump in and body surf. There are life guards all around and the place is a safe as can be. I hear the ocean calling me,Diana W
50,Beautifully maintained beach,"We walked up and down a large area of this beautiful beach and did not see any garbage/trash/glass or anything that took away from the experience. The sand is fine, white, soft sand. There are no rocky shells like European beaches. There is miles and miles of sand and you need to walk a long way in the beautiful clean sand to get to the water, but the view along this gorgeous beach makes the walk down to the water worthwhile. There were quite a number of people on the beach but because the beach area is so long and spread out, it did not feel crowded. I walked away from this beach thinking what a fantastically maintained beach it was (and I'm from Australia where the beaches are excellent).",Belgo96
10,Would not visit again,"The Broken glass and garbage not 5 feet from the water's edge was really a downer! Children could easily get hurt and no one seemed to care. I'll take an east coast beach that is maintained over this ""iconic beach"" and ""must-see"" location!",Samantha N

50,Beautiful sunsets,My daughter and I visited here a couple of years ago and this summer we went back and brought my son and grandsons with us. Beautiful beach! Beautiful sunsets! The kids had a blast playing in the water and in the sand,DAtwood
50,Beautiful and Long,"Santa Monica Beach to Venice Beach and back is a very very long stretch of sand, sand and more sand. The views back onto the mainland with hills in the background were awesome beautiful scenery. Car parking is plentyful in the shopping areas close by but a bit of a walk back to the beach and then a further walk to the waters edge. The beach was clean and not too busy although I can imagine on public holidays if is quiet an attraction. We even say a celebratory Ex England Liverpool footballer walking on the beach. Santa Monica Pier is to be enjoyed with some fine eateries Such as Bubba Gumps and Soda Jerks. Waking along the beach with your feet in the water on a hot day as this wax is refreshing. The pier is also the end/ start of the famous Route 66, so make sure you get your photos in! A perfect visit one to be repeated.",MSA84
50,Same review as for the pier...great!,"To be fair, the pier is an entity unto itself deserving distinct reviews from the beach but for me it was part of a whole experience...a fantastic one.",xtrmike

40,"""Paved Paradise - Put up a Parking Lot""","As Australians we are used to long curving expanses of clean white sand beaches but we found it a shame that great areas of the beach here are under concrete and dedicated to the ubiquitous automobile. However after spending an hour and a half on a crowded bus along Santa Monica Boulevard to get there were not surprised people prefer to drive themselves.The beach is very clean, the water looked clear and inviting, there are excellent facilities for the public, and roller bladers and bike riders have their own separate paths so pedestrians can stroll safely.Hiring a bike and riding the length of the Santa Monica and Venice Beaches looked like a lovely way to spend a couple of hours - although we walked it.",SydneyTeviot

50,Great beach!,We rented a tandem bike and rode from Santa Monica Beach to Venice Beach and back. We stopped along the way to enjoy the scenery.

50,Best Sunset Views!,"This is my favourite place along the West Coast to sit and watch the sunset. There is always dozens of people doing the same thing I am doing & that is appreciating pure natural beauty. The water is beautiful, but rather chilly. The atmosphere along the beach is friendly and welcoming and is brings many walks of life. It's just beautiful. This is one of my favourite spots in Southern California for sure!",RPK89
40,Great sand and well looked after,It's great to see that beaches can be well looked after to provide a clean environment to enjoy the sand and sea. The beach is huge both in length and in depth to the sea with lovely golden sand. There are cycle and walk/run ways which are well used by the locals. Went mid week in September so relatively deserted.,Neale1810
40,Great beach,"Visited here on a Thursday afternoon around 2:00pm. We decided to lay out on the beach spontaneously, so we bought a big beach blanket from one of the shops on the pier and set up camp down on the white sand. Overall a great beach with great views and refreshing, clear water. Beach does get a little crowded, so I would recommend walking further down away from the pier for a quiet spot. Knocked off a star because there was some trash where we set up and a lot of birds flying around.",Sarah S

50,A dip in the Pacific,Visited here on a Sunday and although it was busy there was plenty of room for everyone. The beach is so large that there is even parking on the beach and on a Sunday the local Veterans place small crosses in rows to those who have been killed. It is a wonderful sight. The beach dips down to the sea and causes the sea to really rush in. Wonderful to watch but can be dangerous for the smaller paddler.,svenskmum

It was my first time visiting the year when I was there with some members of my family and friends.The place is full of activities, specially in the pier, where there are many shops, kiosks offering diverse options on food, artists drawing tourists' portraits, and people playing to get some money, among others.The beach is long and good for walking, although in the weekends is quite crowded. The water is beautiful and clean, but for a Brazilian, I would say that is quite cold, even in the summertime.There are options to park in the area.",JuPereira

50,Great to relax or to have fun!,"The beach and the water is clean. If you like the waves you have to try it and feel the power of the water. :) There are crowed in the beach, but you can find a peacful place if you want. The sunset is really nice from the coast and there isn't too much people at that time. There are lots of opportunities to do some sports or any atcivities. The only one thing which isn't so good, the toiletts, those are dirty. I always go to the beach if i would like to relax and I just hear the voice of the ocean and feel the sun! I highly recommend everybody especially if you are in the first time here. There is a really cheap parking lot at 4th Street near the Olympic Blvd corner. It's max 10 minutes slow walking to the beach.",czedlkata

30,The beach is okay.,"Nicely groomed, and certainly large, the Santa Monica beach (on the north side of the pier) is not particularly accessible from the hotels on Ocean Avenue or beyond. There is parking down on the Pacific Coast Highway, but road construction and lack of helpful signage makes getting there a bit of a challenge. Gets a crowd on the weekend. If the beach is a big part of why you're staying in Santa Monica, choose the Lowes or Shutters hotels.",frqyx
50,Fun day,"My son and I walked the pier and then hired bikes and did the Santa Monica - Venice Beach ride. $7 per hour for bikes, helmets compulsory for under 17s (and included in cost).

50,A Lotta Sand,"This has always been a quiet section of the beach, which will certainly change once the Metro starts disgorging riders into Santa Monica.There are public restrooms, a completely mediocre cafe, volley ball courts, plenty of parking spaces. It's the perfect spot for a restful day, bring a picnic or you can walk over to Main Street and get something togo and eat on beach. You can take a longish walk down to Venice, far more crowded and energetic (loud) with a sunset drum circle on weekends). There are numerous bike rental places so you can ride along the bike path (you can take a quick ride as far north as Pacific Palisades or go all the way to Palos Verdes ...or if thats too far, ride to Manhattan Beach and have lunch at one of the many restaurants).",Terri S

40,Wide Golden Sand Beach,"Wide beach, pretty much always sunny and warm. Water is considered cold by the locals, but I didn't find it as cold.

40,Nice Beach,What can I say? It's a beach in California. It is busy and nice. It has the original Muscle Beach (before Venice Beach stole it) which is fun. There is also cheap parking run by the local district (follow the signs) so don't be fooled and think you have to go to an expensive private car park.,Amy B

One in the night time so that we only could see from a far. Then the.next day we could stroll around the beach and touch the cool Pacific Ocean water. It was amazing to finally could touch the water of the biggest ocean in the world .,Donna Simatupang

20,An Absolute Zoo,"I was born in Santa Monica in the 1950's. I grew up in Venice but spent every minute of my teenage years and early working years in Santa Monica. What a wonderful city it was then. As far as cities go, it was a garden spot. Beautiful beaches, quiet neighborhoods, zero congestion, etc. Jump ahead 45 years. What a nightmare the city has become. The summertime congestion can raise your blood pressure to dangerous levels. They have built buildings upon buildings. They have built a sea of gaudiness on every available piece of land. It makes me want to weep. It makes me sick, knowing what once was and will never be again.Had to travel there the other day, a weekday, mind you. What a mistake. Where else but in a city run by dunderheads with no common sense, would you find the streets torn up, at the height of the tourist season and near the big attraction in town, the pier. A friggin nightmare. On top of that, throw in a city government run by ultra-liberals who refuse to deal with the homeless situation, even embrace it, and you have a place no one should visit, let alone with their families. The homeless are everywhere as you near the pier or the 3rd street mall. They are foul smelling, mentally impaired, sleeping on the sidewalks, and in some cases, dangerously psychotic.What was once a beautiful beach community is now a dirty, congested, city. Here are alternatives. If you like walking on a pier, try Redondo Beach, Ventura or Santa Barbara. If you simply want large stretches of white sand beaches, with ocean water clean enough to swim in, I suggest Zuma and Carpenteria. I would suggest the areas between Manhattan Beach and Torrance Beach but there is zero parking for visitors. Even though I was raised there, I cannot endorse Venice Beach. It's just as dirty and congested as Santa Monica.",mgard11

50,Clean and busy beach with lots to do,"The Santa Monica beach is very busy, but also very clean. The entrance to the water doesn't have the washed-up seaweed that you see at some other beaches. We were there on a Sunday and Monday. Sunday was very busy and Monday had much less traffic. The beach is very long. There are a few food trucks up the stairs from the beach on Ocean Avenue (tacos, Belgian waffles, etc). You can also head over to the pier for a snack or lunch. There is a path for joggers and bikers that runs beside the beach. In addition, there are some beach volleyball courts. Overall, a very nice beach.",Anne B

30,Seaweed galore!,"The beach itself was fairly clean of litter, though there was some for sure. There are garbage cans all over to prevent it and the don't stink - so that's good. There were people selling body boards and fruit on the beach, which was nice too because my son and I had flown into California so we didn't have any body boards with us. The peddlers weren't aggressive or rude at all - totally cool. The water did have a lot of seaweed but my 9 year old son didn't care at all! Parking was easy to get to a pain to get to as there was a line to get into the lot on a Monday morning. I can only imagine what it might be like on a weekend. There are bike rentals and places to play on balance beams, swinging rings, pull up bars etc. Just off the beach on the Boardwalk and that was a lot of fun. Venice Beach was a much better time in my opinion, but if you're in the area, definitely stop and check it out.",nickisnotgary

40,Santa Monica Beach Is Wide and Family Friendly,Santa Monica Beach around the Pier is quite packed but the beach is enormously wide and even in summer people can find a little sand to claim for their family.The nearby famous pier offers all the food and extra entertainment necessary just a few feet from the sand.The view of the Santa Monica Mountains and the high rise condos and hotels on the cliff make this one of the most photographic places in LA. People keep the beach clean and do a good job getting people onto the highway at the end of the day. This is not an easy task considering how the PCH seems to be a training ground for the Indy 500.,mcbobleonard
40,"Lovely Beach, but Could Be Better","Santa Monica Beach is lovely, clean, and wide--everything you would want in a beach. It is also right in Santa Monica, so you can lay out, get some sun, and then go shopping on the Third Street Promenade or head to one of the amazing restaurants in the area. One of my favorites is The Ivy at the Shore. I love the decor. Every time I walk in, I feel transported to another place in time. I love the lobster pizza, but they also serve a yummy lobster Cobb, and some of their signature cocktails are truly memorable. As for the beach, during the week it isn't too crowded, but on the weekends--watch out! It can be a zoo in the summer! Try to go on off days, like Mon-Thurs, where you can find a spot and practically have the whole thing to yourself.",bobominkin
50,"Great wide, white sand beach!","This is one of the nicest beaches around. From the Santa Monica Pier south it is much more congested than north of the pier. North of the pier you can find spots that you can be alone with the sand and sea with occasional walkers passing you by. South of the pier, the beach is a little narrower and there are volleyball courts, gymnastic rings, bike rentals, food vendors and a bigger crowd going south towards Venice. A great bike path starts north of the pier at Temescal Canyon and winds down the beach, through Marina Del Rey and points southward eventually ending in Torrance. There are various pay parking lots all along the beach and in off season pretty vacant. I love the north end of the beach.",ZumaDawg

You have shops, Starbucks, Apple Store, Coffee bean, Street Performers, fancy restaurants and just an over all chill place.Now if you are on a budget when in the area then go to the Santa Monica Mall and go to the food court upstairs. You have a variety of foods to enjoy at a decent price. U have mexican, Teriyaki, Italian, and even a Kabob place. After an awesome dinner you can take a walk down to the Santa Monica Beach Pier. If you love people watching the ocean then u will love the Pier. They even have a carnival with rides for the kids. They also have this cool mexican restaurant named Marisol's at the end of the Pier. Get your sizziling chichen or beef fajitas here with a nice Margarita to wash it down. That is my summary of Santa Monica Beach 3rd st. promenade, the mall and the Pier. Do it! You won't regret it.Oh, park in the mall structure too. Enjoy Southern California!Richard Marroquin",Salsarichie
50,A Better Beach,"Being a beachgoer in Santa Monica since 1947 I can tell you this is not the best beach....more polluted for one thing.If you go South about a mile to lifeguard station 26--good for people with kids--there is a wood path to the water, or lifeguard station #27, pretty quiet, it is a cleaner and better beach.

10,"Gross. Overrated. Go See It, But Then Leave.","So we got California, a place we describe as healthy and clean and eco-friendly. However, we got this beach that is covered with garbage. As you can kind of tell by the pictures people posted, the sand space is huge at this beach. For some reason everyone felt the need to be within 10ft of the water. Placing there belongings right beside strangers, with zero respect to anyones personal space. You are probably thinking ""So, what"" and deciding to scroll down-STOP! I have seen beaches across the USA, enough to have developed a standard that Santa Monica Beach did not meet. Do not have high hopes when you visit. Do not plan your day around chilling by the water. Keep in mind that I did go on a day that was ""hot"", so maybe at some different point of the year it is nicer. But, just lower the expectations-visit the pier-and drive north or south along the PCH to find a nicer place to relax and enjoy.",Diana D

40,Great beach for wandering,"As others have noted, this beach is big. That's a good thing because when we were there, a lot of people had the same idea and came to enjoy the sun, sand and water. As an added bonus, the Santa Monica Pier is right there and is a wonderful place to wander, people watch and just enjoy the day. If you stand at the street end of the pier, the beach on the right side of the pier was far more crowded. I would guess its because there was more parking on that side. Go to the left side and have more space. Be sure and walk past muscle beach, see the sites along the sidewalk and enjoy the actual old boardwalk while some still exists. If you are so inclined, be sure and visit the amusement part on the Pier itself. Fun place to ride the rides and a good place for lunch. Great beach close to everything.

50,My kids' favorite place in the world!,"We can't go anywhere in California without wiring in a trip to Santa Monica Beach. Our kids insist on it. It is the most fun beach that I have ever visited. They have parks on the beach with equipment I've never seen anywhere else. We were amazed at the people doing arial acrobats on the beach.The cement boardwalk is wonderful for biking, skating, skateboarding, jogging or just strolling next to the beach holding hands. Many people walk their pets in pet strollers or on leashes. I recommend bringing your own bikes or skates, but you can rent them all along the beach. It is great to have that option, but it can get expensive for a family of 4. We ride our bikes to Venice Beach and back early in the day. It is very close and a really cool place, but if you do it be sure to get back to Santa Monica with your children before dark. We regretted it when we didn't. You can pack a picnic and eat the beach, but if you don't there are plenty of dining options around.The ocean at Santa Monica Mia incredible! The backdrop of the pier with its roller coaster and Ferris wheel in front of the beautiful mountains is a very distinct and beautiful view. The waves are strong and my kids delight in riding them on body boards. They aren't too powerful, but indeed strong enough for lots of fun. If seaweed is a problem for you where you are at the beach, I've found that you can just move down a little and it will be gone. The beach is kept clean and there are plenty of lifeguards on duty all along it. There are lots of restrooms and shower stations, and seating. It's truly a great time. Remember if you will be there after dark to bring a jacket! It gets chilly in the evenings. But if you forget there are plenty of shops that sell sweatshirts all summer!",Crystalyn

But just some info if you search up 3rd Street Promanade it says open til 2am but the shops close at 9:00 pm for some and 10:00 pm for others - so if you plan to shop do it before those times.",SolangeM
40,Totally packed but clean!,"The beach is a must-do in Santa Monica even if you are just walking along the surf in your bare feet. Going down the Venice beach end is a little sketchy so we'd recommend walking half an hour up the beach toward Malibu where you can find a wee place to yourself (well, not yourself but a darn sight better..) the water is cold but clear and the sand is well kept. There are plenty places to wash the sand off you but beware of bicycles bombing it past you and mind that the sand can get HOT!",misspickle

50,Just Fab,"It is 3 miles long, covering 245 acres of sand along Santa Monica Bay. Residents and visitors enjoy broad stretches of sandy beach, rolling waves, meandering bike and walking paths, and inspiring views of the Santa Monica Mountains year-round Great For That Chill Out",amanda shellam

50,Santa Monica Sand,"The beach is a world class ultra deep white sandy expanses below the cliffs of Santa Monica. Lots of parking on beach level, or park above & walk the pier or stairs for access. Pier has food. Bathroom buildings on beach. It'sCali-chic...",David B L
40,California Dreaming,"So much sand before you get to the water. So much activity, beach volleyball, jogging, cycling, skating, exercising outdoors and just strolling along. It's just like you would envisage a Californian beach to be like, loved it so much walked the path all the way to Venice Beach.",our56
40,"Very Busy, very big, very nice beach",The beach at Santa Monica is very wide and very popular. Definitely worth a stroll and a swim (the water is freezing) if you are in the area. Plenty of parking and you can also check out the honky tonk Santa Monica Pier.,johncgore
50,Fun,"We explored the Pier which has rides at affordable prices for the area and a lot of places to eat. We also played at the beach for 3 days. If you move further down from the pier it's better. There's less people and less trash from them grabbing food by the pier and leaving their trash behind. The water was the perfect temp, but wear sunscreen! If you've forgotten a beach towel and/or beach toys they can be bought on the Pier for a reasonable price.",JustinaErp
30,Large but busy in summer,"The beach is huge and there is lots to see in the area (including Muscle Beach). However, the beach near the water becomes very crowded in summer and trying to exit the car parks and return to Santa Monica is tedious. Thus, walk or take a bus if you can.",MPW_Oz
50,Beach Fun,"Fun, volleyball and beach sports aplenty. Great walking and cycling path. Ample pay parking. Close to restaurants, shoppes and hotels. Had a drink at Shutters overlooking the beach and pier.",srezn1042
40,Nice beach,It's a nice beach. It's was a nice walk from our hotel. The beach is rather crowded and people watching ranges from hot people to fat people in thongs. The water had a lot of floating seaweed which the kids didn't like but they found a couple sand dollars which they did like. Overall it is very nice.,LostALot22

40,My Favorite beach,"This beach is not what it used to be, but I gave it a very good anyway. It was one of my favorite places to go (as well as the other places in L.A. area I shared.) I'd go here before ever considering Venice Beach. Go early and leave early.",VickiG95340
30,"Nothing much, but cool!","Nice beach with soft sand and very cold water. It's only worth the visit if it's hot and the sky is clear, otherwise it will look like an average beach. Lots of space to stay and places to eat, as well as the Santa Monica pier always offering something.The ""environment"" is cool and people seem always happy to be there.",RomuloPrata
50,Clean Large Sandy Beach!,"Nice sand and plenty of surf for boogey boarding and the like. Strong rip currents so be careful with the kids. Huge volleyball tournament going on while we were there. Right next to the beach is this huge area with all these people doing extreme workouts using things like gymnastics rings, parallel bars, ropes, etc.",Frank F
50,Love this Beach,Long and wide. Very clean. Great views. Best beach in Southern California. Great for walking also. Easy access.,Teresa M

40,Great beach ! Worth the visit!,"Water was quite cold but once you were in it for a while it got a bit warmer.The sand was lovely,soft and fluffy, there were plenty of bike rentals around the beach, in case you wanted to do my 26 mile cycle path and also you can read my excellent review on the 26 mile cycle path and last I'd like to say the beach is great for family's",Jeff F
50,Not a good place to experience the ocean,"Way too crowded. My children immediately noticed how dirty it was. While it was fun to see folks playing volleyball, climbing the ropes, swinging, etc, and fun to walk the boardwalk, we opted to spend very little time amongst the dirty diapers and cigarette butts on the beach. Getting to the parking was a pain.",Jean G
50,Parking possible at the seafront,"Very wide perfect beach with good swimming conditions, nice water temperature.Parking on the beach is possible at the pier location (full on busy days no doubt) and there is a nice toilet building on the beach near colorado street. There is also lots of parking a few blocks behind the beach. A shower is available near the pier.",Hermes_NL 🇳🇱
50,Redefining 'walking the beach',"Beaches don't get better than SM especially if the criteria is people watching. The boardwalk lets you take in everything from Marina del Ray thru Venice beach up to and past SM beach. Skateboard park is a highlight. So this beach isn't about your toes in the sand, it's more about all the peole and things you see along the way.",BarbKnowles
30,Busy beach,It's a busy beach and can get very crowded and is not the cleanest beach.Its enjoyable in the sense that there are live musicians performing just as you get down the steps. Fruits and tortillas are sold on the beach.,Pgs21
40,Had to experience a Southern California beach,We came here for an afternoon while on vacation in LA. Very large beach. The water was cold but it was a nice way to spend a few hours as we live far from the ocean. We rented bikes and rode from Santa Monica to Venice and that was fun. Had dinner at Bubba Gump along the pier and it was a great day.,Cheryl H
30,If you like dirt!,"Im spoiled. grew up in the luxurious beaches of south shore of Long Island and southern New Jersey, where the sand is white and creamy and not black and dirty like southern California.Other than that the polluted waters in Santa Monica bay offer excellent opportunity for eye, ear and throat infections.Having lived in Marina Del Rey for 6 years, with a 200 yard walk to the beach I know a little about what I speak.Otherwise a fun place. Plenty of characters to watch!!",Emmet R
50,Great beach,"Great beach, very clean and perfect to enjoy the sun and have a swim!It is a popular space but still great to visit.",Debbie S
40,WALK TO THE BEACH,Just less than a miles walk was the beach.Once there we all rented bicycles for $8 per hour and took the path to Venice beach.Great value and the ocean view was unbelievable.,PALMSPRINGSCOUPLE48
50,I visit every day!,"This is my home, I play, run, picnic, surf, swim, walk here everyday. This is not just a place to visit it is a true Southern California experience. Just go for a walk almost Anytime of the year and feel the sand between your toes. Go for a long run on the beach or ride your bike for miles down the ocean front. In the evening wait for that perfect sunset I have thousands of photographs.If you like the carnival go to the pier and ride the wheel or learn how to trapeze. Eat tons of that junk food you love. It's a great place to bring friends and family. There is somthing for everyone.",Bradley1965
40,Enormous beach but beware,"Went on a Monday afternoon with our Tweens. Water temp was nice (especially compared with the Northeast!) but it was windy, which I understand is not uncommon. The beach was huge. Our experience was marred by the arrest of a pickpocket right in front of us - seemed to be working with a family so I was bit nervous about our belongings.",TravelsFromHK
40,Long stretch of beach with a great pier,"Whether day or night, Santa Monica Beach was fun for our family. There is a pier that is especially pretty with all of the colored lights at night. On the pier is a huge ferris wheel and other rides, restaurants, and shops. Bubba Gump seaford is located on the pier. The beach itself is very wide. The water can be chilly, but we enjoyed it, along with many others that ventured into the waters this June 2015. What I really enjoyed was the cement path next to the sand where you could take over a mile stroll or more. There are bicycles for rent along the beach area and roller blades. Many joggers were out jogging on the path, each time I took my brisk walks. The sand is not pristine white, but is cleaned pretty well. We really enjoyed views from the ferris wheel and from the pier of the beach. We walked across the Ocean Avenue to the beach from our hotel, but there is parking that can get quite crowded. Santa Monica beach was so much nicer of a stay than we had in LA. It was only about 20 minutes for us to drive into East LA and see many LA attractions from there. I would recommend a stay at the beach if you venture to LA!!! Oh, and the restroom facilities located on the beach were clean when we were there.",Dom P
30,Very touristy,This is a very good beach for families with young children. The sand is beautiful but the beach itself had a lot of garbage on it. I could not find a changing room and the closest bathroom to the beach is very dirty and disgusting. The ocean also had so much seaweed making it difficult to enjoy the water that much.,kwnike13
10,Got there and got a ticket.....,My wife and I planned to have a romantic evening to celebrate our 17th wedding anniversary at the much famed Santa Monica beach / pier while staying in the Los Angeles area. No parking to be found since parking is apparently restricted after 8 PM for local residents only. We found a spot and walked 300 yards before being told by a Policeman that we would definitely get a ticket. I looked back and saw a meter boy walking to our car. He ignored me as I (calling uphill towards him) tried my best to beat him to our car. He won (Meter Maid Guerrero) and wrote out a $65.00 ticket. What an impression. What an anniversary. Thank you Santa Monica.,20BigAL14
40,Best appreciated from the ferris wheel,"We actually did not went to the beach but enjoyed a nice view from the famous Ferris wheel at the pier. It is such an iconic landmark! We arrived quite early to save the lineups at the amusement park, which has quite a retro feel. The options for the little ones are also great. Because the pier is quite small, it worked well to split the group in two. Great afternoon for everyone.",YULSYD
50,nostalgic,i've gone to this beach before in the past and it is just as beautiful as i remember it. it was the last place i went before i returned home to nevada. it was such a pleasant way to end my trip,アレサーンダラ ク
40,Beautiful Beach,"We visited the Santa Monica beach with some friends on a day with comfortable temperatures and clear blue skies. The beach itself is very wide and it's ideal for taking photos. The view of the ocean, beach with the Pacific Palisades in the background is quite a view. With regards to parking, there were a lot of parking spaces available by the pier priced at a reasonable price.",Traveler C
40,Go early to get a spot!,"Great beach and pier area with a fun park. However, by noon the beach was packed. Couldn't see sand in between people they were so tightly packed in there. Random people walking around selling: chips, fruit, umbrellas, boogie boards, and even Krispy Kreme donuts!! Go early to get a good spot.",Laurie M
40,Beautiful and busy,We didnt actually get off to spend the day at the beach but we drove though it. From the vehicle I could see the beach was clean and the area was family friendly.

40,Clean cool beach,Really a pleasure to stay here for a day. Very clean. Lifeguards on watch and restrooms are not far away. Remember to bring lunch if you plan to stay all day. Restaurants in the back does not serve a lot of takeaway.,Espen H
50,Beach-A-Go-Go,"Yeah, that's right! You can't beat the Santa Monica Beach for fun. It's lively, fun, energetic, and so much more!!!I love strolling along the shore with nothing else to do except; wool gather. After a long day A friend and I was hungry and so we made an evening picnic. That was fantastic and romantic. Get to Santa Monica for a Beach-A-Go-Go. It's twice the fun.",Alex T
50,My Home Beach,"(Note: This review isn't a medical cure for any disease or disorder. Please see your local family physician for advise for any medical condition)Here goes, I was walking along the North Sands of the Santa Monica beach one day (that would be just north of the pier). My right foot had swelling, as I was walking on the North Sands, (it must have been for over an hour) I felt all of the swelling disappear and the toxins in my body gone. The Santa Monica beach is among the most beautiful in the nation and one of my favorite in the world. I totally love it there and I consider it my home beach. Despite all the people it is so quiet and serine and I would highly recommend this beach. Not too far from the boardwalk in Venice, not too far from the Third Street Promenade in downtown Santa Monica. You will not regret it.",Erica B
30,There are better beaches,The beach close to the pier was very busy and not the cleanest. We saw cigarettes and some trash laying around. We were on the beach close to the parking lot immediately north of the pier. Should have parked/walked further from the pier or just skipped this beach and gone elsewhere.,tbga53107
20,Bad Beach,Not a patch on Aussie beaches. Sand is poor grade quality and not much of it. Densely packed. Like sitting on concrete. Not particularly clean. Certainly not inviting.,Nathalie E

30,On Route 66,"It is miles long, wide, sandy beach. It looks beautiful, but sometimes it is too windy, and the water temperature is low for comfortable swimming even in the highest month in August it is 20 C. Also most of the time ocean costs are rough. So it is surfers’ paradise than swimmers.",travelguru-su
40,Its a good place to walk,"If you want to take a stroll, the board walk is a nice place to walk and feel safe. The bathrooms are very clean and well maintained.",Finer C
40,Great beach!,"Whether you just want to sit somewhere chiling and people watching, or fancy getting active in the ""muscle beach"" section, Santa Monica beach is brilliant. A must see if you're in Santa Monica!",IrishLouise
40,Great day at the beach,"We visted Santa Monica when in LA and being from the Midwest we are always worried about crowds. We were there on a Wednesday during the day, but it was not crowded at all. The people we came upon were very friendly and courteous. The beach is very large and well maintained. We stayed near the Anneburg Community Beach House which was a great location since our vehicle was parked near where we spent the day. This allowed us to leave a lot of our belongings in the car and get them as needed. Overall I would definitely recommend Santa Monica for a day at the beach.",iroamaround67801

50,Beautiful and Clean,The water was a tad cold and there was a lot of seaweed but this beach was beautiful and clean. Few fruit vendors on the beach and the pier is right there so it is very convenience. Parking available as well.,Goldenbluize
50,Walking in Santa Monica,"Even in the cold of winter the beach walkways offer a view of the local LA street life. Stalls, body builders, restaurants and people flora. And only a block away is the Third Street Prominade mall. Classy and interesting with a full variety of posh retailers, food & entertainment along a stylish promenade.",Tim M
40,A great beach!,"Early in the morning, in the fog, surfers were riding the waves in. Later in the day, around lunch time, the fog had burned off, and the kids had a great time playing in the surf. It's a friendly beach, relatively clean, and the waves are big enough to be interesting, but not so big as to scare the kids.",kuwait08
40,"Great beach, very spread out.","For me, a beach is a beach. This beach is very large and spread out, always a place to lay out and tan. It's actually well kept up with little trash to be seen on the beach it's self. The weather is always nice. A good place for the family.",N B
40,Good but not Great but not Bad either,"I have seen people say the beach is not that good here, though they are usually surfers complaining about the break. Sometimes we have a good break and it is a good place to start.As for the beach, it is a good beach though visitors treat is badly. I see a lot of people leaving their garbage. Of course, people drink and smoke at night and leave litter. And the seagulls will steal your food if you don;t know how to protect it. Plenty of parking spots in the adjacent lots and main street is close.",hikingdude
40,Not so busy in Winter,"I can only imagine this place at it's peak as my visit was in Winter, it was quiet but still very vibrant. A must see for sure in any season and if you are happy to ignore the tackiness of the 'medicinal marijuana' being shoved down your throat or that of your 10 and 14yr old children. The souvenir t-shirt, cap, magnets, postcards and pretty much anything you could think of typical of a tourist location were a plenty but I am sure this beach had so much more to offer if you were to stay longer and of course in Summer. A picturesque part of our U.S.A trip I must admit and I would definitely return to see it's full potential.",Cathy L

30,"Nice beach, nothing special","It was easy to get to via public transport from our hotel in Beverly Hills. It's your average beach - nothing special but a nice break from the shopping and attractions. It was clean and felt safe. We chose a spot a few hundred meters to the left of the pier - the less busy section. Parts of the area around the beach, road and pathways were a bit dirty and not so nice.",Beccyjay

50,A happening beach,"Very entertaining and colorful with a seeming large cross section of people, representative of Los Angeles. Lots of the general public having fun on bikes, tandems etc. At the ferris wheel end near pier (western end) are a fair range of eating places to choose from...cheap to expensive. Clever people bouncing off large springy ropes, volley ball games, gym rings and LOTS of white/golden sand. Parking $10. Public loos a bit gross, pays to go beforehand.",qadeqade

50,One of my favorite beaches as a local,"I live in downtown LA and don't get to go out to the beach much; yet, I have perused through torrance to Redondo all the way down to Malibu. Santa Monica is always bustling with life, and perhaps my favorite spot. There's secluded workout zones, bike paths, and great eateries...but given all of this, there's very limited parking at all times.

50,Excellent Day trip while in LA area,"We have been several times and always enjoy it. The main attraction, of course is the Pier, with it's rides, Gump Shrimp Co. Restaurant, and the views, not to mention the nearby Aquarium and the ever-changing street show at the entrance! There are public restrooms in the park near the entrance, and on the pier. Gumps has cleaner ones, but may not let you in if you're not a customer (though we've never had a problem).South, off the Peir the boardwalk heads past the ""Original Muscle Beach"", toward the Venice Beach boardwalk. The first mile or so is mostly beach and hotels; there are also pedi-cabs to take you up and down the walk. A 2.5 mile stroll takes you past all the shops and street vendors/performers, down to the ""official ""Venice Beach"" and ""Muscle Beach"" area, that we see on all the TV shows like NCIS: LA, etc. The ""Original"" Gold's Gym is nearby, up Sunset Ave.(The Northern Stretch is a little seedy (but interesting!) and gets ""nicer"" as one heads south.)A 5 minute walk inland (N/NE) one finds the Famous Third Street Promenade, a very fun walking/shopping street, with shops and street performers roaming free! (bring a few 1 dollar bills along). Go at night, especially Fri/Sat! But it does close a bit early... 6-8pm is the sweet spot.Expect a trafic jam if you are driving to the Promenade, but there is cheap parking in several parging garages. We usually park there and wander down to the Pier, then back. an excellent afternoon through evening trip. Enjoy!",David W

30,Yes the Beach is Big but There are Better...,My partner lived here 30 years ago and the first thing he said was...what a shame! He remembered happy musicians sitting around playing music all day! Now all you see are vagrants parked around the beach area. Parking is around $10 and the cleanliness around the area not the best. For us it was disappointing...we have amazing beaches this is average at best!,Mary H

Some of the sidewalks in prime zip code broken, trash, urine, homeless people and areas with great need for infrastructure repairs. Overall an odd experience. ON one hand you have very upscale wealthy people, shops, hotels and real estate, and on the other a failure to house, feed, protect homeless people and no funds to fix the walkways and stairs to the beach.

A really lovely beach with beautiful clear water. Loved it.",Marie F
50,Love this place,"This is my favourite place in the world...so far! There is an incredible chilled vibe that only descends through me when I come here. The people are lovely and willing to help, as well as being unique and quirky. Hanging out down by the rope climb, parallel bars and rings allows you to observe some feats of physical prowess you would only otherwise find in a circus. You can sit for hours enjoying the sun and music whilst all these people practice their 'thing' in front of you for free. Very much worth a visit.",SHoweBathUK

You can check out all the vendors and shops. Watch the ones fishing off the pier. Street performers make it interesting and of course there's the never ending stream of folks to people watch. Interesting indeed. Then youhave the carnival right on the pier: ferris wheel, carousel, small rolls coaster. From a distance or from the air the ferris wheel appears to be coming right out of the water. The lights are stunning at night. Plenty of shops and food choices here and across the street. SoCali visitors should not miss the interesting and famous place. Check out Venice just to the south too.",stOOOge

50,beautiful beach,"I grew up between Beverly Hills and Santa Monica, so this was the beach I always went to.Because of the enormous depth of the beach, be prepared for a bit of a walk to the water. If you are staying somewhat away from the west side of Los Angeles, Take the 110 i.e. Santa Monica Freeway west till the absolute end. It exits just north of the Santa Monica Pier right on the Pacific Coast Hwy.. Also reachable from the west end of Wilshire Blvd. and Santa Monica Blvd. buses, but you will have to take the ramp down to the water.Taking the Santa Monica or Wilshire Blvd buses to the western end of the route will also take you here. -- With a fairly short walk to the beach proper.In summer, plan to arrive early to get a good parking space. Life guard stations are well spaced.The Santa Monica Pier is a tourist attraction of its own. The antique carrousel at the base of the pier has been featured in many movies. From the pier it is an easy walk all the way to Venice. This walkway has also been featured in many movies and TV series.There are the rare water safety problems, so if you plan on swimming, check ahead. Your hotel should be able to check for you.",Eurail

30,It's OK.,"Honestly, it isn't a patch on Hawaii or just about any Australian beach (Cable, Bronte), but it is way better than Pacific North West rock. To the North there is less development and activity on the beach itself, but to the South are lot of paid beach parking lots and then of course Venice and its medical marijuana and t shirt shops and associated 'colorful local characters'. I advise sticking to the North end past the Pier. Nice sunsets and views, and it seems quite clean, but that's about it. Just a beach.",Elwood_Seattle
50,Best Beach Ever for Bycicles,"One can surf in summer, real close to the beach. Water is warm, a bit sandy, but is still a surfer's favorite.

30,Santa Monica Beach,"Very large and expansive beach. Best choice is to enter from the pier. The water is always cold here so be prepared with a blanket and towels. Although they try to keep it clean, the beach is dirty due to ocean pollution. Is is best just to stroll anong the beach or go for a run on the wet sand. The dining along Ocean Ave is good. I would recommend BP Oyster House - the fish tacos were amazind (I recommend the tuna, but it serves somewhat rare).",DanoIII
50,One of the Best Beaches in Los Angeles Bay,"If you want to see one of the best beaches in LA, then look no further than Santa Monica Beach. It is beautiful, clean, has bathrooms, and shower facilities and there are very few people living on the beach like there seems to be at Venice Beach.It is close to the pier, so if you wanted to go and amuse yourself with the roller coaster or views, you can just walk a short distance.Also, downtown Santa Monica is not that far away and within walking distance.The beach is huge and there is room for everyone. If you have a huge party, you might want to get there early on weekends so that you can save a spot right next to the water.Parking is expensive and if you don't park right, you will get tickets that go up to $64.",J S
30,Vast Beach but not the finest,"The beach is vast and seemed not very crowded on the days of our visit. I am not a beach person so I was there just to check out the pier and surrounding areas; I am sure it can be a very fun place for a beach person. However being used to some fantastic Florida beaches (and admittedly some great ones in the north east) the beach seemed less than great; the sand is rather coarse, the water pretty cold and the amenities (which we didn't use) less than adequate. But hey it's a city beach and who wouldn't want a beach a few minutes from a bustling town?",travelover06

30,Crowded and full of homeless people,"While the beach is absolutely lovely, it is also crowded with people, many of whom are homeless. I stayed in the area, which two blocks, for a week over Christmas in 2014 and found the only time it's quiet with few people (I guess most are sleeping then) is early in the morning. I guess everyone, including the homeless, were sleeping in. One word of warning, the sun is extra bright in SoCal, as to be blinding. Make sure you're prepared for that.",Behrcat

It was pretty quiet and looked very clean - and the houses/hotels alongside it were really pretty and interesting to look at. Lots of benches and WC facilities, plus bike rentals and cafes.",Cathy S
40,A walk along the beach,"We walked most of the way along this beach, from the pier to where it becomes very bohemian, lots of homeless people, dogs and definitely people who have either been drinking or are on serious drugs, this part is a little edgy and I certainly wouldn't want to walk alone here or go there at night time. The rest of the beach was nice, with a fun fair, lots of people walking, runn, skateboarding, roller skating and be careful as it is all a bit frenetic and we nearly got knocked down a couple of times, interesting to see but not sure I would want to stay here.

50,My Daily Scene,"Living in Santa Monica, it's a privilege to visit this beach daily. It's a gorgeous beach with lots of shore line/space. I walk my dogs on the path every morning, run on the beach a few times a week, and lay and play in the sand and sea when the weather gets above 75. SaMo beach is absolutely beautiful and vibrant.Things to consider:Parking: There is plenty and the price goes up weekends and holidays. If you can, ride your bike!Food: Bring your own to picnic or plan to eat afterwards, perhaps at Tender Greens on Arizona. There is only Perry's on the beach which is not the best.Restrooms: The restrooms on the Santa Monica side are located near each lifeguard tower. They are typically very clean--but don't expect the same if you head to Venice Beach (or if it's super crowded on the weekends).Bike Path: Be advised there are TWO paths next to each other; One is a bike path, the other a pedestrian path. Both are lovely ways to experience the beach--just make sure you're on the correct one!Surf areas: Some areas are designated for surf or swim. Pay attention to lifeguards and signs. Also, if the surf is too rough, the lifeguards will tell you. They are always on point.",Neghar

40,Jump on a bike,Grab a coffee or tea and sit at the end of the pier watching the men fishing. Then jump on a bike rental (beach cruisers are fun) and meander up and down the beach. It's a super easy ride down to Venice Beach too and completely flat. We got our bikes from a small hut just to the left of the pier (if looking to the sea). The track takes you past muscle beach and on to Venice and the canals.We had jet lag so arrived quite early. There were a few homeless sleeping on the beach which was a little bit of a shock.

There are also a good variety of restaurants too, including several serving fresh seafood. My son and I rode the ferris wheel - $8 per ticket.

A lot of tourists and community people from there socializing. Nice streets, nice parking lots, great looking hotels and homes. The beach was beautiful there was a lot of families playing on the sand, getting wet, playing volleyball, tanning on the sand and bike riding. Parking is pricy here so finding a parking lot can be hard. Traffic is hectic too.Second time I went which was this year in April 2015 I went with my family and we just drove through the Main Street at night very nice atmosphere.

30,Better from afar for us Southern Hemisphere beach lovers!,Felt more like dirt than sand? Actually much preferred to sit on the balcony and watch the beach. Lots of rubbish buried in the sand as well.,LianeatLarge
50,All Day Parking isn't ALL DAY,"Loved this beach. However, when the parking machine/pay station says ""All Day"" parking, it doesn't mean ""ALL DAY"" parking. The first day we visited, we parked in a lot off of the PCH. It said ALL DAY parking on the machine and we didn't see any signs that said otherwise. We got back to our car at 8:15pm and noticed a parking ticket for $53. The note said no parking from sunset to sunrise. When I went back to the pay machine to see if it said that anywhere, it was flashing that notice since it was after 7pm. Something we didn't notice when we arrived. For all day parking, park near the Santa Monica Pier. The only times you can't park there is from 2am-6am. Lesson learned!",Jessica S
50,Beautiful beach,Walked along the boardwalk and got caught up watching some people on the rings and some others on some tightrope contraption. Very entertaining.Lots to see and do well worth a day trip down to Santa Monica.,Michael I
50,Awesome Beach!,"This was such a great day! Spent hours upon hours swimming in the ocean, getting as red as a lobster! It was such a blast diving in to the warm waves and being thrown around by their sheer power. The beach is huge, lots of sand and space for people to move around.The pier has lots of fun things to do, whether you’re e on your own, with your spouse or with the entire family or friends.I will always remember the ladies selling fruit on the beach shouting “Mango, mango, fruita, fruita!” to get people’s attention. Put a smile on my face.Truly had a great time here and would love to go back one day.",David Z

40,beautiful sunset,"went to santa monica pier later in the day but it was so crowded we couldn't get near it, so we went to the santa monica beach to watch the sunset. nice beach, fair amount of walking from parking lot to water but water was rough - they had a no swimming warning due to rip tides. couldn't find any shells. there are plenty of volleyball nets. there is a cement walkway that runs the length of the beach close to the parking lot. bathrooms/showers available. did not notice any food stands although there may have been some - it was end of the day maybe it was closed already..",bornnorb
50,Best beach,"I would go as far as to say Santa Monica beach was the best beach I ever seen, maybe I was caught up in the CA magic but WOW.

50,SANTA MONICA BEACH,Santa Monica Beach western Tip was very beautiful and the ride along the beach was really exciting. We understand that it is the western tip and it is famous for the Route 68 from Chicago wherein the first person who travelled from Chicago to Santa Monica Beach is famous and one of the favourite number printed on the T shirts.,VISWA2601
40,Nice and lively .,"It is like any other beach in California .. more on the lively side .. Can get very crowded at times . Nice sand , clean and well maintained ...

If u r around LA , worth the visit but I wouldn't go just to visit this place .",Sruj
50,A must see,"This beach is so many movies, it is a landmark and a must see. The water is ocean cold and the sand is fine and clean. They have free rinse off showers at the entrance and even a wooded pathway in case you have a stroller. The bathrooms are on the pier and the pier offers food and souvenirs. At the beach the vendors have umbrellas and fruits. Going back today to hang after a great time yesterday. 👍🏼",Celine_CT

50,Great beach!,Santa Monica is an excellent beach trip! The beach is wide and the sand is soft. We didn't swim but many people were in the water when we were there. The pier makes a great place to grab a snack or ride some rides or buy some souvenirs. Parking isn't a problem since there is a lot right on the beach and a large parking garage a few blocks from it. Definitely a great place to see the Pacific Ocean!,vhecht

40,Incredibly crowded,"We had a few hours before connecting flights so we took the C blue bus to Santa Monica. About one hour trip to get there as the traffic was a lot. It was also Easter Saturday so when we got there we were amazed by the masses of people. Big beach ans super crowded. I enjoyed the experience. Got some fresh air and sun. ATe some shrimps take away at the Buba gump Shrimp. Definitely a place to visit if you have 6 plus hours stop over,m",Swissmiss6969
40,Amusing for Kids,"Visiting the beach in early April is likely the best time to hit the pier, the weather is good and the crowds are still manageable. Best to get there early if you have young children who want to ride the rides.",451alexo

40,"Huge beach, a must see for SoCal trip",Great beach but very urban. Lots of homeless in area. It's a good place to see the quirkiness of the Pier although it's a bit seedy. Nice restaurants and shopping up on Ocean Dr & 3rd St Promenade.,DCgogirl
50,First time on the west coast!,"I visited California in January 2015. Santa Monica was my first ever experience with the Pacific Ocean... it wasn't warm enough to swim, but the sand was gorgeous and I collected many coloured rocks off the beach to bring home to my son.",Lyndsay M

40,A great beach,"What a great beach; we loved it. It is clean and expansive, and full of life and cultural diversity. There is a boardwalk down onto the sand which must be great for people with disabilities and elderly people. The signage around the beach shows that the local council cares about the residents.The beach is backed at one end by cafes and at the other by a collection of interesting (not flashy) homes -great for a stroll. And of course there is the wonderful pier! And many cafes and restaurants a few hundred metres away in the town. Definitely worth a visit, and near the airport which is great if you are in LA on a stopover",Ert53
50,Amazing beach!,I was very impressed with the Santa Monica Beach. It is huge-both deep (a long way from the sidewalk/bike path to the water) and long. We enjoyed a beautiful walk along the path.,SenoraNovi
30,Its got sand,By Aust standards a fairly average beach which has lots of sand but doesn't look exceptionally clean and has a steep entry into water. Quite a number of homeless people but they do not bother you. The pier and surrounds are of more interest.,Silvertoptravel

50,Run Santa Monico California,"We recently stayed with our son in Santa Monica. The house was one block from the Ocean Park Boulevard and about 5 blocks from the beach. Once you arrive at the beach you can run to the left or right. There is a cycle/running paved pathway that is shared with runners and walkers that is parallel to the beach. If you run to the left, you will get to Venice in less than a mile and the pathway runs out at about 1.5 miles. There is lots of trash on the ground and the beach houses are in need of repair. If you turn right after reaching the end of Ocean Park Boulevard the beach is pristine (the sand is graded every morning). You can cycle 4 miles (cycling is prohibited after 4 miles) or run 4.5 miles to where the pathway ends. When the pathway ends, you can see a good surfing break at Malibu about half a mile away. The break is to the right when facing the shore. There are lots of runners, walkers and cyclists even at 0630 hours. On some days, a Pilates Class meets and volleyball takes place. A great place to exercise.",Roderick L

50,Lovely Walk,"This beach is clean and a lovely walk either along the beach or walking to the end of the pier, When we where there we saw a seal at the very end of the pier stealing fish from the fishermen's hooks fishing there, we also visited the area where people go to train, the beach is swarming with walkers, runners, sight seekers, skate borders cyclists, basicaly all walks of life frequent this beautiful beach",Trackerh

40,What a great day at the beach!,Had a lot of fun on our 3 visits to the beach! It was truly beautiful and they provide so much to do outside of the water. I have never seen silks and outdoor swings and such so it was a real treat. Everyone was friendly and the beach was always clean when we went.,ChiReviewQueen

50,"Gorgeous beach, a bit cold in March!",We had a lovely walk along the Santa Monica Beach last week. The water was cold but it was so beautiful! I imagine it's crazy busy as the water gets warmer. We were there on a relatively quiet Monday (March 23). Highly recommend a visit here.,UKMay05
40,Too packed,"We went late April last year, weather was perfect. The equipment and all these play ground was really good and well maintained. Just on the main beach seems like too packed. Maybe go on a weekday.",Fannnn
50,So much fun at Santa Monica Beach!,"My boyfriend and I spent a weekend at Santa Monica beach in February. We lucked out and happened to be in town during an unusual warm spell! The beach was well attended by sun war-shippers such as ourselves. We rented bikes and cruised the beach from Santa Monica, through Venice and up to Del Rey. The road is flat and a beach cruiser is all that's needed. We loved it! We also wandered down the pier which was fun for a few minutes and loved watching a group of people that had come together on the beach to practice their acro-yoga (very impressive!) The beach is beautiful and sandy. We loved our time on Santa Monica beach and would absolutely recommend it to friends.",604Stephanie
50,the beach to go in Cali,this is one of the best if not the bets beaches to go to. right next to the Santa Monica Pier it's at the perfect spot. some say it can get overcrowded but if you go early enough (between 8am and 11am)you'll get the perfect spot you want and prking.,Maritza H
50,Great beach!,"Beautiful, large, clean and safe.The water was freezing cold ( March 15th) but not very crowded (bonus) and the waves weren't very high. We enjoyed walking the beach along the shoreline ( even under the pier)-just relax and enjoy the sound of the waves and the spectacular beach.",lizter3
40,Beautiful,"Went to this beach during the day and its pretty relaxed. At night it was more beautiful because the pier lights up with people,music, and entertainment.",natzeli m
50,Most amazing beach,"This beach ranks very high in the list of great beaches. There are vast wide stretches of white sand far as the eye can see with the mountains above Malibu pink in the distance and the azure blue waves crashing along the shore . Best of all the beach has not been invaded by the private beach nonsense that spoils so many areas along the Mediterranean with sections cordoned off by the hotels and inaccessible and vistas spoilt by hundreds of sun beds . You can walk for miles along the beach and catch the pelicans flying above. There are a number of Perry's cafes along the way and of course you can take a bike a few miles along the bike path and enjoy it all , Venice, Muscle beach, and the wonderful characters along the way . However barefoot in the sand means you might get some patches of oil on your feet. We discovered the best top tip for removing this ...mayonnaise . Yes it really does work!!!",Lynne G
50,What California is all about,"Would live here year round if i could afford it. Lots of great things to do and see at the Pier, super wide beach,. you can walk for miles",James2559

50,"Relaxing, fun, and very large beach","We could walk to this beach from our hotel, and it did not disappoint. There's a busy pier/boardwalk with carnival-style rides, a coffee place, a few food places, public restrooms, and assorted pushcart-style paraphernalia. On the weekends, the pier is packed with people. The beach alongside is huge, with clean sand and plenty of room for all of the visitors. There's also a bike path and walking path from this beach to several others on the coast (some 20 miles), which weaves right through the sandy area - very pretty. There is no admission cost for the beach, but if you have to park there, it is quite expensive (up to $36/day) but you could probably park in nearby garages, or even down the beach a bit, for less. It's also a great place to view the sunset.",IslandHopper011
50,Santa Monica Beach,"The beach area is lovely to walk , ride or skate. Great for families and the Santa Monica Wharf for a visit. We visited and stayed in Santa Monica for 5 nights and the weather was lovely n warm. A place for everybody!",bisky63_13

50,Great Beach,"If you stay more than 500 feet away from the pier, the water here is clean except for right after a rain. Shuffle your feet as you enter so you don't step on a sting ray. Dolphins, sea lions, and rarely, a gray whale may drop by. Beautiful mountain and island views from the shore. Very refreshing, especially now that global warming is making Santa Monica hotter than it ever was before.",Valerie W
50,Good,The beach itself is really good and stretches on for ages so it doesn't seem crowded. It is nice to sit down on the beach for sunset.,Jake S
50,Wonderful beach and everything....,"I took 2 hours subway and 20 mins bus from Long Beach to get here and it was just WONDERFUL worth the long ride!!!,the main road is full of little cute restaurants and bars, the sunset was so beautiful with musicans playing soft jazz near the pier,and the beach is actually really quiet the day we went, walk on the sand is comfy and the highlight was just sitting there with a coffee listening to the live band Denmantau playing bob marley...(they are on venice beach-theme park), I would definately go back there again.highly recommend if you ever visit L.A!!",DanielleLY
50,A must visit,This is a 'must visit’ area when you are nearby. The view over the ocean and the long wide beach is the perfect place to take a break. In the evening it turns into this beautiful quiet scene with the sunset.,OJdk
50,"Even when it's cold, it's beautiful!","We traveled there in March and it was a bit cold but yet, the sky was always blue, the sun out and the beach gorgeous. We did not go into the water but walking by the beach every morning was pain-less exercise!",LATRAVIATA5
50,Its is a great hangout spot,This beach is a great spot that we came to several times to relax and take in the sunsets. If I lived in LA I would come to this beach all the time because it feels like its not a part of LA. There are washrooms near by and you can get food and entertainment every where off the beach.,Byron Dwyer
50,Cleaned up!,The beach is wide and all of the vendors are gone. The view isn't great (no mountains) but overall a nice beach.,5Boysrus5
40,Great Place to Hang Out,"Great view of the ocean. I just went today to hang out with friends. We played football and volleyball at the beach.

50,Fun on the beach!,"Visited Santa Monica Beach on a Monday in the early afternoon and it was busy. Being from the middle of the country, going to the beach is a rare treat. The family loved splashing in the ocean! I thought the beach had a great atmosphere with the pier right there that had a variety of restaurants plus the rides. Parking was plentiful, however it did cost $12, and is right between the road and the beach.",redbird71
50,Santa Monica Beach - Always a Destination,"When we're in LA we always visit Santa Monica Beach. Relaxing walks along the wide, beautiful beach, views of the Santa Monica Mountains and those California sunsets keep Santa Monica and the beach on our list of destinations.",RikiUSA
50,Love Santa Monica!,Amazing long sandy beaches with amazing walkways and places to chill out whist people watching. The sea and sand is pristine clear and the Pier is great fun with its fun attractions and great views of surrounding Santa Monica. You can hire a bike and cycle along the cycle routes to Venice Beach or just relax on the beach. Weekends tend to get quite busy so parking can get a little crazy or just park near to the Santa Monica Promenade. Santa Monica is also the end of the iconic route 66. Santa Monica Beach has been used on many movies and American TV series including Baywatch! A great place to visit whilst youre in LA!,orlandouk
50,Nice beach,"Really amazing beach where you can enjoy sunshine. It is a great place for you to have a little rest. Enjoy the view of sunset if you can, that is a really wonderful sunset view.",MickyPiggy
50,Beaching good fun,"We came here because it was on our list and pitched near the pier.We planned to stay the day and parked at the end of the sandy beach. This is not a place for wheel chairs! We pitched next to the lifeguards and it was a busy day, but you just enjoy it. Water was ok with some surf for the kids. There is no alcohol permitted on the beach, don't even attempt to bring any.Please be aware the breeze is nice but sunblock! As you will burn very quickly. Our kids just wore tshirts even for swimming.The pier is interesting and it's where we ate in the early evening. There is lots going on.Plan for the day take plenty dollars and some body boards for surfing.But a parasol from Walmart.We went in August and the sand was very hot.You can go further up the beach for more privacy and space and there is parking all along but the pier is very popular.My tip is do your homework first and plan that way you will enjoy the day better.",Cannella2012
50,Great Beach,"Wow I have never seen a beach like it, it is so deep from the road to the surf, and so clean, We were really impressed. Great to stroll down from Santa Monica to Venice Beach.",ShaunW1968
40,Enjoy the sunset on the beach,We visited the beach after going to the Santa Monica Pier. It was full of people playing on the sand and surfing on the waves. A fun place to people watch,darylmarx
40,Nice beach,"This is a nice beach. It is very easy to get there. If you go by your own car, it is lot of parking halls few blocks before the beach. It is not very expensive to leave your car there. If you go by bus, the bus is going via Santa Monica Blvd and you can hop off the bus in the beach. The traffic is quite slow there, so you must take much time to go there. The beach is clean and there are not too many people in weekdays at June. If you are hungry there are lot of different restaurants nearby.",Hapaa
50,What a great asset for the people of Santa Monica,"The beach is awesome! Very big, not crowded when we were there although, to be honest, there would need to be some sort of invasion for it to feel crowded. It is VERY BIG! Cleaned each morning and people by and large respect the Beach Rules set out on posters. We didn't go in the sea so can't comment on that element but the whole feel of the place is positive. Great historic pier with carousel and other rides,too. Great areas for walking, running, cycling, roller blading, promenading, whatever takes your fancy. Loved it!",MikeLeicester
40,Good Beach,"You kinda can go wrong with Santa Monica beach. Its where Los Angeles meets the ocean. The pier is always fun, there is an arcade with skee ball, air hockey and video games. The pier also has a ferris wheel and other rides. In the summer months the beach around the pier gets really crowded. Do yourself a favor and pick out a nice patch more toward the south. The beach to the north side of the pier is where the surfers hang out. If you want to see surfing head over there. If you are really lucky you will get to see the pod of dolphins that live here. They get pretty close to the beach sometimes.",Jack S
50,First beach Ive ever seen and I loved it!,Ive never been to the beach in my life... Until now and Santa Monica beach is beautiful!!!!!! Would love to come here anytime! 🌊🌊,Maria R
40,Always lovely even when the weather is not,"Santa Monica beach holds many memories for me as my wife and Ispent many hours there when our kids were young and we lived inthe Los Angeles area for 3 years. I recently went back to Santa Monicaand did not want to miss the opportunity to take a power walk along thestrand.Bikers, walkers, talkers and runners filled the pathways and madefor an always delightful experience on the beach path. You can gofor miles and if you are lucky enough to catch a clear sky and Pacificsunset, it can be spectacular.The view of the beach from Palisades Park on Ocean Avenue isalso interesting and quite different from being on the beach itself.If you are so inclined the Santa Monica pier is iconic and fun butyou have to be a kid or have kids to truly experience the activitieson the pier.If you are in west Los Angeles do yourself a favor and take a strollalong the Santa Monica beach. It is worth the effort even if the weatherdoes not cooperate.",Traveling Coach
50,So relaxing!,"Loved it and the Pier! Very relaxing even in January! Too cold to swim IMO but some were paddling and surfing a little. Just great to walk around on a sunny day! Lots of restaurants nearby, too!",Annie055
30,Traffic and Parking was Horrendous,My brother tried to warn us but we still decided to go. Our exchange students wanted to go see the famous pier. After leaving Hollywood and taking an hour to drive 14 miles it took us another half hour trying to find a place to park. We ended up finally finding a place in two hour parking but we were so far from the pier that we stayed on the beach with the kids and let the exchange students go check out the pier on their own. I would have rather gone down by Huntington like my brother suggested where it is less crowded and parking is free.,Milanlan
30,Feet covered in tar from paddling on the water's edge,"We thought this was a beautiful beach with gorgeous sand, paddling along the water's edge between Montana and the pier. That is, until we realised our feet were literally caked in tar. This explains the birds unable to fly and the assortment of dead bird carcasses close to the water's edge. Absolutely disgraceful. What a waste of such phenomenal natural beauty and certainly glad we didn't swim today.",Muso22

50,Awesome tendy outdoors day trip,"Excellent area for cafes & restaurants. Easy to get to from anywhere including if you're staying around LAX its an easy day trip. Be prepared if you stay later than 4pm that is starts to get chilly. We hired bikes. We've over 55 & 60 and its a perfect way to get some exercise, see a lot quickly and get a feel for the place. You can cycles the boulevard for miles up to Venice, Manhattan & Hermosa beaches. You can easily visit the Pier and there's lots of street merchants selling trinkets of all sorts from crystals & clothes to food & jewellery. Quite a busy area so make sure your kids are in sight. The beach area is huge and there's lots to do. Highly recommend a visit to Santa Monica Blvd and beach area.",Suzanne m
50,Beautiful beach in LA,"I got one of those bus tours around LA, and had 3-hours to enjoy the beach and shopping.It was all sunny and beautiful. It's a good place to go if you are in LA and it's really close toThird Street Promenade if you want to have a good food while shopping.",May_Malek

The pier, the bike path, Venice - you can easily spend a lot of time here. The pier tends to get crowded, and there are quite a lot of people trying to sell you stuff, which can be annoying. Prices are quite high at nearby restaurants and bars.",Sral2214

They not only groom the sand everyday, they also clean the restrooms 4 times a day and empty 400 trash cans daily. This beach and the Santa Monica Pier are iconic to Southern California. A must visit for tourists to California.",t100baker
40,Nice small beach in LA,"Went there on Dec afternoon. Weather was good during the day however as sun set, temp dropped very quickly. It is a clean beach and did not have a lot of crowd. Ample parking available on beach for nominal charges. You can also chose to rent a bike and ride along the shore.",DKD
10,Comercialized to the max and prepared to pay overpriced food,"- Yes, it is a famous beach and everyone would totally die for to visit the beach. I do not think there is anything attractive about this beach. It is just like any other beaches. Nothing fancy, nothing interesting, nothing unique. Just...beach, thats it!- A little artificial for my liking.- A big amusement park built on the pier but it is not free entrance.- The whole area is super touristy.- One thing you need to take note is Santa Monica is a little away from downtown LA. It takes at least an hour to get to the beach if you are driving or catching a bus/train. Also parking could be a problem cos we couldnt see any available parkins.- There is a MacDonald nearby if you want some cheap food.- Once again, you are in America. Lots of homeless people..they are everywhere. I can tell you wherever you go, there are homeless people in America. So be prepared to smell some really stinky homeless people.- One part of the beach is filled with homeless people and then a few metres down you see rich yoga-enthusiastic, beach-buff, gym-junkie and etc at the other parts of the beach. Ironic aye?- We only bought some corn-dogs from the cheap take-away shops cos they seem to be the cheapest. There are restaurants like Bubba Gump or Route 61 etc but they were all filled with tourists.- It was a good place to visit but certainly not a place to stay longer than 2 or 3 days.If you think my reviews have been helpful to you, please click 'Yes' for 'Was this review helpful?'",TravelQueenie365
50,Take off your shoes and feel the sand...,"It's a great beach, you can just relax and take some photos, or you can go for a run, rent a bike, go surfing, lots of activities there. Lots of homeless people but it doesn't feel unsafe, just don't go alone at night.",majomaol

30,"Nice location, but pier slightly grotty","Santa Monica beach is very nice, and the pier is an interesting attraction, but it is also slightly grotty (reminds me of tired British piers). But still worth a visit if you are in the area.",PaulK1960
40,Good For A Short Visit - A tourist thing...,"As expected the beach was crowded with tourists, however it did not take away from the great view to the north where the mountains start. Perfect for kids who are experiencing the ocean for the first time and want to ""get their feet wet"" - warning it is COLD and well you have been warned. On grey days you may have a more solitary (still lots of people but it seems more of a place to get a great walk in) and walking north will be the perfect thing to start your day in Santa Monica. If you are staying in one of the beach front properties you have paid a price for the access, take advantage of it !!!It was fairly clean and people seemed to care about keeping it that way, at least during our visit. Like many beaches the hype and build up do not meet the expectation (i.e. oak street beach in Chicago) but again, you can say you were there, and move one to the many great things to do in Santa Monica.One plus, there is NO downside to the sea breeze, wakes you up, you feel better, connected to the world and ocean...and that is a good thing !!!",JulieTherese_11
50,Always nice to walk,I like Santa Monica beach because it is not so far from LA and is just very nice to walk around. Parking is cheap and there are nice places to eat. Try to go when there are less people and you can enjoy the peace. I love to go after it has rained :D But this rarely happens in LA so...,Pureum K

50,Great for everyone,This beach is clean and beautiful with something interesting for everyone. It's a great spot to do morning runs and a full workout including yoga if you like to get your fitness on while traveling. Finding a spot for enjoying your morning coffee would be another morning activity. There's fun for everyone mid-day with lots of sun bathers and beach volleyball tournaments. Only a short walk to all kinds of great restaurants and places to grab a drink. Walking down late at night feels safe and gives a great spot to get cozy listening to the ocean waves and watching the faris wheel on Santa Monica Pier.

We parked right at the beach for $8 all day. Parking was very busy (Sunday). Beach busy but not too busy with people of all ages. It's a sandy beach so people were making huge sand castles and sun bathing etc. up on a pier nearby there are many restaurants, street vendors and performers, as well as lots of washrooms and a funfair and rides. We used the indoor carousel ride with our baby, $2 for adults kids are cheaper-fun. Walk to the end of the pier for good photo ops. Walk along ocean drive or right along the waterfront for lovely views. Great place to visit if you are seeing the area. Downtown Hollywood is about 30 mins drive away.",happy_red30

40,"Santa Monica - Fun for the Kids on the Pier, Great Shops for Mum and Restaurants for the Family!","We stayed at the LAX airport for a one night stopover after flying from Vancouver and before travelling at midnight to Australia. We had half a day to fill in and so we cabbed it to Santa Monica Beach from the airport Hotel to have a good walk around, some fun and good eating. The temperature was about 22 degrees and sunny. Much warmer than the weeks before we had spent in Vancouver and Whistler and so this was a pleasant surprise. We were not disappointed.The cab both ways cost around $US100.00 but we did have a great time and it was much better than staying in the Hotel where we were staying which was not that great - see my review on Hyatt Place, Nash Street, El Segundo.First, we went to Santa Monica Pier. We had been there before but my 12 year old son really enjoyed it. We bought some souveniers on our last day o/seas which were fairly good quality on the Pier (caps and T-shirts and Hollywood and California branded rubber thongs). We listened to the buskers which were so good and stared at the ocean for a while. I had trouble getting him out of the games shop with so many pinball and other games he had never seen before.We then went shopping for me up to the 3rd Street Promenade and Broadway where there is a shopping mall with no cars. All the good shops were there that are usually in the US - Zara, Gap, Addidas, Footlocker, H&M, Victoria Secret, Nordstroms, Sears and many others. However, the prices were great and this week they were having the end of winter sales. My son was blown away by the Barns & Nobel bookstore that sells music, games, Lego as well as magazines and books. It is on about 3 levels and very well merchandised. A pleasant environment to relax and browes around or have a snack and coffee.We then went to an Italian restaurant on the corner of the 3rd Street Promenade that had a red awning on two sides and tables and chairs outside on the footpath so you could watch the passing parade. It was fabulous. They advertise home made pasta and I had a spinach ravioli which was one of the best I tasted. There were Italian wines by the glass and traditional Italian pizza for my son. We had an excellent lunch there and then cabbed it home for a rest before packing up on the next leg of our journey home to Australia.Apparently, Venice Beach is also relatively close to LAX if you stay over but I was told by the staff of the Hotel that it is not as nice as Santa Monica Beach. The last time I was at Venice Beach, I thought it was grubby and lots of drugged induced bike riders peppering the pavement. Santa Monica Beach is much nicer, cleaner and more fun. There is a great vibe there.We chose this instead of a day's outing to Disneyland or Universal Studios. We could have booked a bus pick up from and back to our Hotel at LAX but it was going to cost around $US320.00 per person (12 and up) for the days outing and then you would have food and other purchases on top of it. It probably only cost us about $US160.00 for the cab, lunch and tips. Our other discretionary spending is on top of that but you do not have to buy anything. We had fun and would do that again.I recommend a day trip to Santa Monica Beach especially if it is warm and a sunny or partly sunny day if you are breaking up a trip home and having a stopover in Los Angeles.",JacquiR-K
40,Not bad,"We have been here multiple times and many of our friends do not like this beach because its often crowded and the mix of people aren't what they perfer. We all agree that the pier can be fun. But somehow we always end up back here because of the familiarity of it and also because it has ample and near restrooms which is a must for us with young children, and also other beaches around LA. Its not always the easiest place to find parking and this time we drove around too but found one pretty far but still walking distance. IT was free after certain time so no need to rush :) Yes this beach gets crowded and there's a lot of people, both young and old but usually its pretty clean. There are others cleaner and way dirtier but its not too bad here. IT was cold that day but the kids still swam, munched on snacks, played in the fluffy sand, dug for bugs and little crabs and flew kites. It was nice and relaxing. What we do like is that the restrooms are nearby always on the way out plus washing stations are there too. That is important for our family because of little kids. It was clean when we got there but kinda sandy later but still doable. Its an ok beach if you are around the area, but we do perfer Laguna and definitely Del Mar our favorite. However, this is one of our go tos. Next time, we'll visit the pier again.",livelovex7

50,Even better than you've seen in the movies and on TV,"My family pioneered this town in 1875, so the beaches here and northward to Malibu are pretty much in my DNA at this point. While the beaches themselves have widened considerably over the past 70 years, they continue to offer that kind of soul-freeing experience that one gets when in the presence of considerable beauty. I think fall and winter offer the best sunsets and it's always fun to see so many people standing and watching it slowly sink into the ocean, the after-glow in the sky - and it's especially nice after a storm when the view of the coastal mountains are breathtakingly clear. In the summer the sun sets over them, and quickly. While the water is not Hawaii-warm (summer it may hit 70, but not likely, more in the mid-60s) kicking back on the sand, taking a soft-sand jog, ambling along the shoreline or just people watching or napping, this place is hard to beat. The only drawbacks are the lack of walkable good restaurants (there's not much food at all) and you can't enjoy a beer - while you enjoy the sun. Plenty of life guards in the summer and don't think that winter keeps the SoCal sun away for long. There's plenty of days for continued lounging on the sands of this once-quaint and now bustling burg.",Michael H
40,Beautiful paths,"Whether you are a walker, cyclist, runner or roller blader, you will love these paths. We walked and ran fron the Santa Monica pier all the way to the Venice beach pier.

40,Excellent on a sunny warm day.,"This was our first stop in our Family vacation, this year we decided to go to LA and do the tourist thing. We paid $6 to park all day, about 1/2 block from the pier. This place is beautiful and relaxing. You can have a picnic on the grass and enjoy the view and people watch. Bring your bike or roller skates and cruise the paved bike path. Take a walk on the pier and visit the little shops. We did not go on the rides but I'm sure they are pricey. We didn't know where to eat so we had lunch on the Pier and paid $80 for 3 adults and 2 kids. Overall I recommend this place for a family with kids to spend a nice afternoon by the beach.",Isisg81

50,Great for a Run,Phenomenal early morning run basically on the beach but on pavement path. The beach was clean and very nice. Somerestaurants to eat at aside from the pier area. Some places to shower and use the restroom. Highly recommend a visit here!,RSHAH26

40,"One of our most popular, beautiful beaches!","Clean, supremely beautiful and great for hanging out, long walks, runs, or rent a beach cruiser (vintage style bikes) and go.We like its proximity to the Santa Monica Pier, and Third St. Promenade action. Plan a full day to take it all in. The sunsets are breathtakingly beautiful here.Also try out the Venice Beach vibe & scene. That is a wonderful beach with relatively clean, bathroom, outdoor rinse off/ shower facilities, and patrolled by guards, security and there is a noticeable police presence for safety.",SoCalSiren
30,Just a beach,"Just a typical beach with beach stalls. Really forgettable. Theme parks are generally dated. Unless you are not going to disneyland or universal studio, its totally not enticing. Will not be back.",Briyano
40,Great Beach in LA,"Been to a few beaches in LA and San Diego, and this one is one of the best. Huge sandy beaches, with easy to navigate waves. The parking is the most ample and easy to get to at any beach Ive been to. The pier has plenty of food, facilities, and fun, allowing you to take a break from the waves. Wonderful place to hang out and enjoy the ocean!",Ryan L
30,Too big for my taste,Right by Santa Monica Pier this beach is vast. In summer it must be my absolute nightmare but in winter months it is almost deserted and perfect for long walks.,pinkhotstone
50,Just cool,"Perhaps it is a bit cliché to say that you went on the beach in Santa Monica, but the location is good, the beach is very clean and the location is great. What else to ask for.Quiet, pleasant location with restaurants and shops just close by. and if you are a bit on the sport side, well rent a bike or go for a run for Santa Monica beach to Venice beach.",Gaëtan P
40,A lovely day at the beach,"Had a day to spend wandering Santa Monica & it was so nice strolling along the beach. I didn't rent a bike, but would probably do so the next time.

50,Loved the sunsets,"Being a Queenslander we don't get sunsets over the ocean - spectacular, loved this every afternoon :) Beach was clean and so wide, water was blue and clear. I live at the beach in Qld but I loved this area. The nearby pier, the bike-track right on the beach, the swings, and the original muscle beach. We hired bikes and rode to Venice Beach. Nice friendly lifeguard - who let us have a photo with him on the tower when we were having photos done with a photographer, one of my kids got to hold the iconic red flotation device :) Definitely lived up to my expectations",4Fun2014
40,Nice Beach!,"Santa Monica Beach is a beautiful beach with stunning views up the coast towards Malibu and south towards Marina del Ray. The beach does get fairly crowded, which can be annoying if a person doesn't like tons of people, but there's a lot of room to find your own patch of paradise.",abq757
50,Spectacular,"travelled from Uk and stayed very close to Santa Monica beach, first ever time seeing it and we (family and girlfriend) will never forget it for so many good reasons. One night we timed it for the sun going down and it was one of the most magical, inspiring and spectacular sunsets were ever going to see. We have pictures galore that still give me goosebumps.The beach is very clean, the sea warm enough to body board or take a dip. I went out body boarding 3 days straight. The people keep to themselves but never get in your way, and it certainly never felt over crowded.This is a fantastic, well kept, inspiring beach.",Jason C
40,Beautiful sunsets,We loved being at the Santa Monica Beach late evening to watch the gorgeous sunsets. And the view from the Ferris wheel is amazing.,Taffr
40,Huge and clean,We took advice from reviews here and kept away from the pier and found plenty of space on this massive beach. Pretty clean as well. The sea was quite rough and slopes away steeply. We used the steps and bridges from Ocean Avenue to get down to the boardwalk and beach - handy.,Peter H
40,"""Great walk""","The beach itself is to me always cold even in the summer. However Santa Monie Beach is great for walks with you love one, plenty of restaurants and activity for young ones. What I absolutely love about this beach is watching the sun set. Find a nice restaurant on the beach and seat outdoor with a glass of wine watching the sunset. Priceless!",Kevin B

50,Beautiful walk,"Santa Monica Beach is beautiful for morning walks, jogging and biking. Some people swim, but water is pretty cold and very strong waves.",UnderTuscanSun
40,No Curfew Beach!,Santa Monica beach is a normally small wave beach with long sandy walks to both the north (Malibu) and south (Venice). There is no curfew (good for romance) but that doesn't mean you can camp. Just bring your blanket or bag and stay as long as you like. The police are friendly. This time of year (fall) the water temperature starts to get cold so you may need a wetsuit but you can still wade and play at the nearby pier.,Mitchel N
40,Quintessential California Beach,"What can I say, beautiful sand, the ocean and plenty of sum. It doesn't get any better than this. Only complaint was that the restrooms did not have any soap. Loved the paved walking path down to the Pier. Parking for the day was reasonable.",Unknown_Traveler

40,"Very Nice, but felt sorry for the homeless","Visited this beach fairly early in the day, there were loads of homeless people slleping on the beach and around the garden area above the beach, it's a shame that this has to be the case these days and I wish there was a solution to this problem these people need help.",MrChumlyWarner

50,Beautiful Breezy & Relaxing White Sandy Beachfront,"Took the LA sightseeing tour bus along Santa Monica Boulevard past the Houses & Villasof the Stars before arriving at Santa Monica Beach. The long bus journey was well worth it.As we walked onto the Beautiful White Sandy Beach there was a lovely warm breeze blowing towards us from the beautiful Blue / Green Pacific Ocean which filled the entire horizon in front of us. Bronzed Gods and Goddesses passed in front of our eyes from Right and Left, walking, Jogging cycling and skateboarding. Some were jogging along with over groomed Poodles and others with strangely attired dogs & animals. The famous Santa Monica Pier with all kinds of rides including a roller coater & Ferris Wheel was to our Right. We decided to go Left towards Muscle Beach. We walked for a long way passing a movie set. Past many forms of street artists who were truly brilliant. We passed the Zoltar fortune telling machine (Tom Hanks - Big) and visited the Venice Beach Ale House (to be recommended. There is plenty to see and do on Santa Monica & Venice Beach and further along there is the Queen Mary - Sorry I could go on and on.....",Michael W
40,Baywatch,"Just like a scene from Baywatch. Those lifeguard towers are just like in the TV series.

50,sensational beach,great clean beach with good facilities for chair and parasol hire. Pebbly around the water's edge but not so as to stop you going in. Great breezy climate and lovely soft sand. Not too busy with good life guard presence. Watch out for the waves though.,happylondoncamper

50,Lots to do--and places to park!,"The beach has great waves, volleyball nets, soft sand, and best of all--lots of fairly inexpensive parking right along the beach! I always park in one of the day lots that are $10 for the day right on the beach & are open from sunrise to sunset. It is easy to walk right out onto the beach, & depending on which lot you park in, the Santa Monica Pier is just a short walk down a paved path. I was impressed by how clean it was! As a Midwesterner, I was ecstatic to be able to go to the beach in October! I'm pretty sure it was already snowing back home. I even saw dolphins one day!",Lauren B
50,Wonderful place to relax,"I love sunbathing because it's not to crowded.It's also nice just to sit down and look at all the people at the beach. Sunbathing, swimming, exercising, jogging or just a picnic. Just enjoy the life on the beach!",Solvang446

50,Absolutely beautiful,"This beach was everything I was expecting and more. The sand was soft and warm(perfect to walk on!), the beach much larger than I expected but was amazing, the ocean just breathtaking. Also the wonderful walkway was just icing on this breathtaking cake! My only regret was we didn't stay at a hotel on this beach. Parking fee was something we could have done without($12) but everything has a price I guess! But this beach is a must if visiting LA or Santa Monica.",Nikki C
50,beautiful long beach,"Lovely beach with piers, walking, skating and cycling paths, coves, rocks, facilities and everything you may other wise need for a day on the beach. We rented bikes from the pier and cycled along the beach, which was really fun.",IlkeDagli
40,"Amazing beach, great and powerful waves, bikes + other things to do","We were here twice in 4 days.First time we at all (parents, 2 teenagers and two kids) at Big Deans then rode bikes hired at Sea Mist bike hire next door (includes tandems) down to the skatepark near venice and back. This skatepark is absolutely first rate quality according to our teenage son with a great bowl with smooth drop ins. The rest of us went to a quick swim then back on the bikes past shops, bums and cool cafes.If swimming be beware the beach to the water drops steeply and within say 10 feet you are in 5 foot deep water in this area.The 2nd time we played on the gymnastics area with people very helpful to us on using the rings and played chess at the public chess area. Again locals really friendly and helpful.We then went for a swim, this time within 200 mt of the pier. The drop off is not as steep and so about 20 mt out you are at 5 feet deep. On this day, again, the waves were very very strong and dumping. I would say they were some the strongest waves Id felt in quite a while and I can see why people get into trouble. There was also a reasonable rip out and slightly across the beach.Whilst we were there a bodyboarder got dumped by a wave and got taken to hospital in a an ambulance. So if swmming dive under the waves and make sure you keep your hands and arms out in front if body surfing.The beach is not in any way filthy but was a bit unclean with people leaving litter.The beach volleyball, although not tried, matches the reports and looked to be a lot of fun with some random games.The amazing visual things are the width of the beach, which is enourmous, the sea mist coming in mid afternoon and the sand was great for sandcastle building.Definitely must spend at least an afternoon here if visit LA.By the looks of the pier carnival Id forget it if you were going to the main LA parks.",big_family_4_kids

30,"Huge clean beach, cold water, parking a problem..",I went with family in May'14 and after almost 30 minutes of searching we managed to find parking space! We went in the daytime n the sun was scorching n we got badly sun burnt... so it was a big surprise to find that the water was so cold we could not swim in it which was disappointing... The beach is huge and there is quite a distance one needs to walk to get to the water...the beach was very clean which was a plus. I saw many people enjoying cycling on the tracks.Since we could not swim we did people gazing at the beach and at the Santa Monica Pier instead. Frankly I enjoyed more at the Pier than at the beach as it was crowded but fun.,Mona M

40,"Typically too crowded, but still one of the better kept beaches.","The closer you get to the pier the most crowded it gets, I enjoy going farther up the PCH toward Malibu and the beaches usually thin out and there is better, more reasonable parking, and it's still beautiful and well-kept.However, if you like the crowds, then by all means, hang near the pier, it's still a great beach, just gets crowded!",DoubleOIncognito
40,Lovely clean beach,"I was amazed at the size of Santa Monica beach. I was expecting a small beach both in depth and length but I was completely wrong. It's massive !I loved the fact it was pristine, beautiful golden sand with no litter or rubbish around. Plenty of space to park and plenty of room on the beach, so people are lying in rows like sardines. Also great views up and down the coastline.",Travellover6128
40,Grand beach,"A typically wide sand area marks the Santa Monica beach, which is cleaned & graded every day. My teenage son had a swim on this 72 deg Fahrenheit day & loved it, with its sizeable waves, but unfortunately short ride dumpy waves. Not sure if the beach is normally like that, but the waves are always going to be dumpers with a sharp rising beach edge. Great views & scenery along the beach.",Chris D

40,Expansive and clean,"Typical wide expansive beach which is well maintained. Most visitors seem to utilise the bike tracks, fitness equipment and grassed areas rather than the sand.",Hazelnutineverybite
50,Beautiful,One of the largest sand beaches I have seen anywhere. I am from Miami area and we have beautiful beaches but the size of this beach is amazing. And....one of the best sunsets in the world!,Flhappy
50,"A beautiful, expansive beach","What I liked: An iconic beach that lives up to its fame from the Baywatch era. Great restaurants around, pier is lively. Great family fun. Water is great.What I disliked: No shade whatsoever, so you have to take your own umbrella. Because of its popularity specially with the tourists, parking can be a problem, despite the huge parking lot. You may encounter seaweed by the shore, so you have to swim out a bit to get clear of it.",briskwalkers
50,One of the cleanest beaches I have visited,"For people in Southern England, Santa Monica can be compared to Bournemouth for the cleanliness of the beach, and the area. The area above the pier is a park running along the north side of the cliff to the entrance leading to the pier (which runs over the road). The steps down from the pier lead to the promenade, where Muscle Beach can be found (south of the pier). The sands of the beach stretch for miles in both directions.",BussPotter
40,Interesting,"We always enjoy the Muscle Beach. It's fun to try out the different rings/bars, rope climb, etc. Or simply watching others try it out is fun too. The beach is a stone's throw away from the Boardwalk. The beach is clean. The current can be strong so be careful and watch your kids closely.",SocaLakwatsera
50,So pretty,The Santa Monica Beach was very nice. it wasn't too crowded when we went in August. There is a nice view of the pier from the beach.,Leeza9

50,Wow. Super good time.,I liked the live entertainment and loved our tour. Would reccomend a sweater at night though. The tempurature dropped about twenty degrees in a matter of a couple hours.,Kristyn24
30,Sand Sand and more Sand,We took our kids down to check out the beach. The sand went on and on forever making it look really fake. I was grateful they had a path to and from the pier as the sand was incredibly hot and wearing shoes with wet sand on your feet is an awful feeling. There were a few homeless people and some guys that kept trying to sell us things as we sat on the sand watching the kids swim making it hard to relax. They need more areas to rinse off as there was a line up by the time we got back to the pier entrance and waiting with little kids that have sand everywhere is not a nice experience. Compared to Australian beaches it wasn't very nice,Brieana H
50,Beautiful Beach,Staying at the Fairmont Hotel entitles you to a private section of the beach. The hotel drives you to and from the beach and supply soft drinks. You can even order food which is brought to you whilst you relax in the sun.The beach is immaculate and very clean. Highly recommended,T0llie
50,"Huge, Urban Beach with Lots to Do",Santa Monica beach is a great place for all kinds of outdoor activities from laying on a lounger in the sun to participating in an energetic pick up volleyball game. Grab a bike and pedal on up to Venice Beach where the people watching is an Olympic event.,Boudecca

30,Just like every other pier,"I had high hopes for the pier at Santa Monica BUT I was a bit disappointed. It's just like any other pier, even those in the UK, and has tacky arcades and restaurants.The only reason I gave it a 3 rating and not a 2 rating is the big wheel. It's such an iconic Santa Monica landmark.",GDoherty79
40,Beautiful view! Weekend traffic on the Pier unbelievable.,"You won't want to miss a visit to Santa Monica Beach. It will give you a flavor of the California Coastal happenings. There are nice areas to sit and enjoy the views without actually going down on the beach. The pier traffic was almost insurmountable on the Saturday we were there. There are loads of restaurants in the area to grab a meal. Also, lots of great shopping!",DLSproul
50,"Lovely beach, great for people watching","We arrived in Santa Monica on Labor Day (Monday). We decided to have a walk along Santa Monica beach and along the Pier.There is so much to see and do, and a great place to just sit and people watch.There are pathways for cyclists to use and ample space on the beach to find your own spot.Muscle beach area is great to watch people flexing their muscles and trying out new skills.The area felt very safe to walk around, and there is lots to do on the Pier with the funfair, among other things.A ride on the ferris wheel is a good choice, as it gives you lovely views of the beach and hills.",Diane C

50,What's not to like?,SO beautiful for the health conscious or the carnival crazed. If you stay at the Loew's you walk right out your door to a shoreside heaven!,Mary S
30,Good for a bike ride or run!,"The beach is nothing out of the ordinary - full on weekends. We thought the pier was fun and had a few good treats but it's not like the one you find in Galveston for instance. It's small(er) but free, I'll give it that. We did find the area AWESOME for renting a bike and just cruise along the ""freeway"" for bikes - it's well worth the money and is entertaiment for hours in a row. Don't forget to get a locker - if you are exploring Santa Monica and Venice you may want to lock the bikes at some hot spots.",Pedro G
50,"Long beach, lots to do, great for people watching","We stayed at Santa Monica for 4 days and walked/cycled every day, you will thoroughly enjoy the whole experience. The beach runs for about 5 miles, walking is safe and fun. You can hire bikes for $8 an hour, bring a driving licence or photo ID and pay when you return the bikes. The rides are on cycle pathways and there are plenty of cafe's / restaurants / bars to eat and drink.The other point is the beach is very clean, you can easily walk bare footed.",jonip1966

40,Bring boogie boards,"We brought boogie boards from home, as well as an ice chest, blankets, towels, and beach toys. We bought a beach umbrella from a beach vendor and we really needed it and liked it. The waves closest and south of the pier are good for boogie boarding. Further south, there were people surfing. The beach is great for taking walks, jogging, and people watching. I didn't get much water time. I would never leave anything unattended on the beach. There are a lot of homeless people here, who seemed harmless, but some of them were walking in and around the blankets. Many pick up trash and recyclables which was nice. We played catch with some some homeless guys and they had fun. There is glass on the beach, so it's smart to wear sandals.",07travel

The mountain views are also amazing (if you can see them through the smog)! The parking was expensive though. But the bike paths looked nice (didn't get to take advantage). Lots of people walking the beach selling fresh fruits, umbrellas and boogie boards! We ended up taking advantage of all of it! Can easily go to the Pier and play as well.",Luv2Travelw2boys
10,Beach Turned Swap Meet,"Went here over the past weekend and could not have been more disappointed. My boyfriend and I live in West Hollywood and rarely ever get to the beach. Last weekend over Labor Day weekend we had a great time at Manhattan Beach, so we decided to try and have another beach day. We have been to Santa Monica a thousand times but we had never actually sat out on the beach.We parked south of the pier and went looking for a spot on the sand. We almost immediately didn't feel comfortable here. The demographic was mostly hispanic families with tons of children running around. From the moment we sat down we were bombarded with illegal immigrants trying to sell us anything from ice-cream to boogie boards to umbrellas to shovels and pales. It was awful. Not to mention when all the illegals decided to take a break, they all congregated around where we were sitting and just stood there jabbering loudly in spanish and standing aggressively close to us. They had no respect of personal space for anyone. So much that my boyfriend and I packed up and left because it was so terrible.The city really needs to crack down on this illegal Guatemalan swap meet that is taking place here. They are aggressive and inconsiderate. You can not relax on this beach AT ALL with them constantly walking by you only feet away ringing bells and shouting. I love Santa Monica but we will never go for a beach day here ever again. It is much more worth it to drive up to Malibu or down to Manhattan beach.",xBret

40,Surf and Sand,"Nice wide clean beaches. A bicycle and foot path which nearly reaches where Sunset Blvd. meets the Pacific Coast Highway and extends through Venice to Marina del Ray on down towards Palos Verdes. Plenty to see along the way including the Santa Monica Pier. Lots of places to stop and refresh along the way, or just meander, if you tire of basking in the sun or dodging the waves.",r-j-r662
50,"Huge beach, plenty of space for everyone","Surely one of the finest beaches in the World? Wide soft sand, plenty to do - or just watch the world go by. Felt very safe. Beach cafes offer very good value. Loved the Pelicans.",BobandJosie
30,This beach is huge!,We were on the beach a little north of the pier. The walk from the parking lot to get to the ocean was very long! There is so much sand here! The parking was really expensive. A few miles further north up the coast and its a few dollars cheaper. The ocean was really rough the day/time we were there but the kids still had fun.,AKO661
40,A really nice beach,"from venice beach to Malibu, there are so many things to do there.. the pier has a carrousel wheel, a small theme park and a lot other shops, there's even a nice aquarium there. great people, great times during the day and night.",mario_92551
40,Nice Beach and drive,"The beach is pretty wide and beautiful. The best thing about the beach is the hills nearby as it creates breathtaking views during sunset. I went there around sunset time so that i can relax and watch the sunset.The beach looked clean and calm. we walked all the way to the pier at the end where we saw some nice street artists and some good food. The atmosphere was great even though it was crowded. If you like, enjoy a funnel cake and if you have kids get them on the rides and games in the pier. There is also a small aquarium, but it was closed the day i went.The best time to visit is evenings and if you are with friends do not forget a volley ball as there are plenty of nets where you can play. Do not spend time in the expensive beach resorts, as when you are at the beach, the best thing to do is to be on the beach and soak up the sun and the ocean!The bonus is the pacific coast highway that runs along the beach. Drive through PCH(California 1) and enjoy the ocean.The only issue i faced was parking. Most of the parking spots charge you at least 10 by the hour so be prepared. The biggest time waster here is trying to park as there was some constuction going on, which narrowed the roads. They let you in to the parking lot without checking whether the slots are free. And vehicles are jammed together.But overall we really enjoyed this beach and the sunset.",Madhu_Nair

50,Lovely beach,"Went on a beautiful Saturday, and it still didn't feel as crowded as the Jersey shore. For a major tourist attraction (that was the reason for me being there) I was impressed. The beach was crowded but clean, there were people selling food on the beach, my mom loved the fresh fruit and I loved the chicken tomales some lady was selling for just a buck!Great thing about this beach is that it's nice and wide and on both sides of the pier so there were plenty of options where you wanted to situate yourself for the day.Definitely recommend!",Toni-ann C

We got there around noon and it was still quite foggy and couldn't really see much around us we were told that the fog would burn off later in the day so if you are planning a to go i would leave it till later in the day but we did go quite early in the year. The pier was lovely and you can grab a bite to eat there, didn't have time to go on the beach but it looked lovely and clean and i would of loved to visit it when bay watch was in its prime heyday.",jessimo
40,Santa Monica Beach,"We had a really good time at the Beach. A little crowded, but the pier was really nice, if you like to be where the action is. If you love shopping, remember to visit Third Steet Promenade while you are here, as it is right next to the beach.",KatjaThomsen

Is that correct.",Sandra N
50,Beautiful Beach,Easily accessed. Beautiful soft sand that extends for what seems forever. Many restaurants easily accessible along with various sport activities along the beach!,Charles R
50,Beautiful place!,"We were staying in west Hollywood and wanted to have a full day at the beach. Since we chose not to drive, we selected to grab a cab instead of the hoho bus (about 45 min instead of 1:30 hrs!) We knew the fare is steep but again in comparison to hoho bus it's about the same. I could actually live there! Great walk trail to Venice Beach, (had lunch there), we also saw 3d street promenade and the pier. About 50 bucks each way, (we texted the cab driver and picked us up!) and it took us approximately 9 hours to do all that. Food is cheaper in Venice, and the beach is less crowdy too. Santa Monica yet is a luxury place compared to the bohemian style of Venice. Totally worth it!",Aikasmy

50,Prototypical California Beach,"This is what people picture when they picture the beach in Southern California, or what some people picture when they picture California at all. The beach is HUGE, and the pier and the city of Santa Monica are nearby if you need dining, shopping, etc. The crowds are pretty big, but that is because the beach is awesome.",Jon P
50,Best beach in southern California,"I am 70 years old and through high school I went almost every day in the summer. Now I live 400 miles away so I can only go when I am in town. But I love it! The beach is very long (from parking to the water, I mean). In fact, approximately at the end of Ocean Park Blvd, there is a boardwalk so you can walk part way to the water on it instead of so much slogging through the sand. The waves break pretty far out so you can get long rides on surf boards or boogie boards. And there is shallow water for small kids. Just a great beach with lifeguard stations all along. If you arrive in the morning even on a weekend, you can usually find parking on the street a couple blocks away.",Jan536
50,"Fun, Family","Ok, its not like the beach in Hawaii, but on a hot day in LA, its still an excellent option. The pier is fun for some street performers, good restaurant options, artists, arcade, circus school. We always go to the end of the pier to see what the fishermen caught. The beach itself is busy, but its so huge there is room for everyone. Ok, so the water is a little cool even in August, but it doesn't deter the hundreds of kids I saw there this weekend.",LenaG1969

50,California dreaming,"We walked from Venice Beach to the Santa Monica Pier by the edge of the ocean along Santa Monica Beach. Glorious sand and plenty room for all.

A beautiful place to stroll along, swim, sunbathe, or just chill.",Malcolm H
40,Wonderful for an early morning visit.,My boyfriend and I went very early in the morning due to our flight arriving before 7 am. It was nice and even though it was early there were plenty of surfers and people running along the paved path. It was gorgeous but we were a bit disappointed with all of the trash along the shore. :(,VahnCairbourn
50,Beautiful place!,"Loved Santa Monica!! We were there at night as well as during the day. Walked the pier which was fantastic and during the day the four of us hired bikes and cycled along the boardwalk for over an hour past Venice Beach, which was really cool to see, and back again. Stopped at the markets along the way and had a ball. Highly recommended.",Vivian A

40,Classic California Beach,"Good place to relax on the sand. The beach is huge, so there's room to stretch out even on a crowded day. There are other fun things to see and do nearby like the pier and downtown Santa Monica, so this is worth staying for a while. The downsides are overpriced food and lots of traffic around parking areas. But, if you arrive in the morning and bring a picnic you won't have to worry about any of that.",Adam W
30,Nice beaches but heavy traffic,Really great place to be. If by car do mind the heavy traffic almost every day of the week. Being a tourist it is a bit of a hassle to fund a parking spot or to get around. Besides logistics: it is a nice beach really comfortable located just of the city of LA. Reminded me if the beaches close to Barcelona.,TomWildenburg
30,Another traffic nightmare in LA,"My family and I rented a house right on Santa Monica beach in early August. The house wasn't great, but it was on the beach with great views of the water, pier and mountains. The sunsets in the evening were beautiful. However, I never wanted to explore the area due to the traffic. Once you get there, you either need to walk everywhere you go or plan on a lot of time. Unfortunately I had to go grocery shopping a few times and the traffic was extremely frustrating. Santa Monica beach itself is HUGE. It takes 4-5 minutes to walk from the beginning of the sand to the water. And the sand gets so hot it burned my feet even though I had on sandals. When we sat on the beach, we stayed closer to the path because going all the way to the water with chairs, drinks, towels, etc... it was too much effort. I only got in the water one time. The bike path is great and we rented bikes at Perry's. It's the best way to get around. We rode to Venice Beach and into town. Be prepared to see a ton of homeless people everywhere.",travelbug90587

50,Loved it!!,"Santa Monica Beach is a must see when in the area. It is a beautiful location to watch the sunset from. It's large, clean, and has wonderful sand.

If Venice and Venice Beach are a bit more to my taste, Santa Monica is undoubtedly a must go place when in LA.",giampigiampaolo
50,"Nice, clean beach",We spent several afternoons at the beach. There are restrooms and showers evenly spaced closer to the bike path. The beach is wide and trash cans are everywhere. Closer to the water's edge was where the majority of people claimed spots for sunbathing. Peddlers came by periodically with fresh fruit or sand pails and boogie boards. Good time.,Bruna F
40,Clean and well maintained.,Beautiful and well kept. They seem to groom the sand. It was cold this summer and water was cold so didn't attempt swimming. Lots of surfer's,notaholidayToronto
40,Worth a visit!,"The area is well maintained ! The pacific expanse is wide and the water is blue!

50,Great Beach!,"My husband and I stayed in Santa Monica for two nights and basically just laid out on the beach the whole time. The weather was fabulous and the beach was HUGE! So much room to spread out. There are also some parts of the beach where some of the hotels rent out chairs for the full day to you. We paid $30 for the full day and they also bring food/drinks to you (but no alcohol). You can also leave your chairs and come back to them if you wanted. The beach was not too crowded where we sat even with all the people there on the weekend. The pier is very close too if you wanted to go get lunch or see what else is going on, but it was pretty crowded when we went.There is a restroom somewhat nearby after you get past walking like 5 minutes in the sand! There's also bikes you can rent and bike paths to ride along if you were interested. There were also adult size monkey bars and other equipment near the beach. If you want to shop, there were also a couple street vendors up at the pier, but there weren't too many shops like those you would see at Venice Beach. Overall, great Beach and GREAT view!!",shia027

It took us another hour and a half to get out of the parking lot.

40,"Beach-wise, the most famous dock of the world!","It's the one you Always see in the TV series and in the movie when shut in LA. It's impressive, as once you are there for the very first time, you seem to perfectly know the place... the dock itself with its peculiar underground, the little shops, the ferris wheel...The beach stretches for miles and it's free, and of course, you are facing The Ocean!!! So do not expect to find clear crystal water, on the contrary: icy, deep blue and huge piece of wanderful sea!!! Don't miss it!",CristinaFabSer
40,So relaxing...,"*I actually went July 2013, they make you put a date*I really love this beach. I didn't go there to swim or to tan, I was a tourist so I pretty much went there to go to Santa Monica Pier and to see Venice Beach. But it was so nice. It's busy, but really relaxing. I think it's worth going.",tk1323
30,Much cleaner and less crowded away from the pier,"Dropped my son off at UCLA so we brought our daughter here so we could have some fun at the pier, too. The beach is huge, but if you have kids you're going to be watching in the water, the beach drops quickly off into the ocean so it's very crowded up close and you can't see your kids from further back. It's not nearly as crowded and the beach is much cleaner the further you get away from the pier.",7Rutherfords
50,Clean,We found the beach to be clean. There was a wide variety of people there and all were very friendly. The water Pacific water was a bit chilly and the swim was exhilarating on the hot day.,Rob D
50,Butler service on the beach.,"Had a great time on Santa Monica beach using the butler on the beach service. Based at Perry's cafe. They provide chairs and umbrella and tables also options for towels, suntan cream, drink and food. Your butler sets it up on the beach and take it all down at the end of the day. You get a walky talky to call off anything, so don't even need to move for a drink. wasn't cheap but as staying in a hotel and didn't want to buy all the stuff for 1 day was great for us. So if coming down for the day and don't want to carry everything with you look it up on line.",Tina M
50,Fun Beach,This beach is very clean and I enjoyed the walking and bike paths along the water. It is great for people watching or to spend the day.,MistyLS
50,Clean and Beautiful,"This beach is all that it seems at first glance. You can swim and surf and the lifeguards are active and working hard. I was wondering why they were working so hard and we realized that we were in the ""surf area"" and were not allowed to swim for safety reasons. We headed down a little further and could swim. The weather was fantastic so what else can we say? Go and enjoy",mamablum

The beach is amazing, lots of interesting people to watch and the pier is just lovely, stroll along the pathway and watch the body builders in action. We really enjoyed the shopping there, a fantastic shopping centre with all the high end shops and a beautiful outdoor mall with lots of smaller shops, just lovely.",Kerryn B

40,To the beach!,"I grew up spending my summers at the beach, so I try to go to the beach at least once a year since I live in the Midwest where there are no beaches. The beach itself, was clean.

30,Just bike,"If you thinking to go to Santa Monica beach for swimming your totally wrong,even though you have to pay $12 regular parking fee the city does not care about cleaning the beach. you will stick your feet in polluted tar on the beach which it comes from ocean to the shore! and finally it messes up your feet, your, shoes and your car.it is only a good place for cycling.",Able2014
40,Great beach,"I like this beach.There are always people around doing all sorts of different activities. The Santa Monica Pier and Third Street Promenade is nearby. There's a biking trail from Santa Monica to Venice. Santa Monica has its own Muscle Beach as well. There are tons of volley ball nets and good surf spots too.Parking isn't the best, but there's a short term parking lot that allows you to park for 2 hours for cheap.",Tunaidi
40,Nice clean beach,"Great area to stay in whilst visiting LA. LA is close by and not the greatest place to stay given it the usual city downsides (crowded, small rooms etc). The beach itself isn't overly busy the time of year we went so it was great if you wanted a bit of space.",Harmeet S
50,Walk and bike,"Beach is not very good to swim but just to walk, bike and contemplate. They have this thin funny houses near the sea, reminded me some of the english houses, it is worthwhile to go there and also to be in a boat trip from the santa monica pier.",Anaya K
30,Beach is just ok,"I walked along the beach after leaving the Santa Monica Pier. It is very wide there, and very crowded on a weekend day. I think the city of Santa Monica could do a better job keeping it a bit cleaner. There are much better beach choices a short drive up the Pacific Coast Highway (PCH)!",Steve H
30,Fair beach!,"The parking was not bad its 12$ of u want to park near the Santa Monica Pier, the beach is a little dirty but nothing any one can't handle. Overall nice place to hang out and recap all u want to do and did. Pier Is something u should visit for sure.",Kinu2013
40,Great time!,"Sorry, this is a little late!!Stayed near the beach one night post-cruise. Walked from the hotel to the beach expecting to see what we see at our beaches in Michigan! All I can say is ""WOW""! This is a beautiful beach! Clean and family-friendly! The pier was such a pleasant surprise with all the rides and boardwalk gaming! Do not miss seeing Santa Monica Beach if you're ever close by!!!",NayRN

50,All you want from a beach,"Well, what to say, California is known, among other things, for its beaches – California, in modern days, spells beaches. The white sand of its vast expanses is the white gold of the state. While there are myriad beaches in southern California, all with their own fancy name and their own fame, Santa Monica Beach may be regarded as one of the crown jewels in the tiara of beaches stretching down the CA coast. It stretches for miles and is bisected by the famous pier with its amusement park, the stores and the restaurants and the food court. There is a pedestrian promenade along it up on the street level, there are many (fee) parking lots along it. There’s also a bike/walk path on the beach, and close to the pier you find an exercise/fitness park, free of charge. There are more than enough trash barrels on the beach, and thus the beach is clean – more or less; there are always some trashy folks, pardon the pun, who litter. The water is clean and not too cold. If you want to get away from the hordes of kids who keep sprinting past you screeching and spraying sand on you and your towel, move away from the pier a bit and you’ll have solitude.",Esty666
50,Must visit,Must see if you have time. Clean water. Must walk on sidewalk and see the vendors and performers and buy stuff. pay for parking. Rent bikes if you have time.,David W
40,A Real CA beach,Large and can be crowded but being from SF I love to just lay on the beach and people watch in SNSHINE!,CameraOn
50,So much fun,This beach is wonderful because the beach is so large there's plenty of room for everyone. The pier has rides and restaurants and on shore there are even more restaurants and entertainment on the 3rd Street Promenade. A fun beach with amazing restaurants like Gladstone's and Hummus Bar Express.,lindawJ811LW

50,Big enough for everyone,"Long, large expanse of white sand spotted with county lifeguard towers and close by facilities. The shore break is gentle enough to be safe for kids and the life guards are vigilant.The beach is clean, extremely well maintained. The bathrooms are new & all the stalls always have paper!It can get crowded on the holiday weekends but you can always find an isolated spot far from people by planting your blanket a short distance in from the shore line.There are Perry's restaurants and bike rental facilities to take advantage of the bike path.Several parking lots along the PCH do fill up but you can usually find a spot if you keep looking.Great safe family beach",anamshaz
40,Lots of Sand,This is a great beach close to the city. Lots of places to eat and drink. The pier is your typical pier with street vendors and the like so very entertaining and historical.,Tim L
40,Views Pigeons and Shrimp,"Had an eight hour layover at LAX and thanks to some CA friends was rescued and taken for a late afternoon excursion to Santa Monica Pier. Had not been back for decades and it still is a special place for people watching and getting reconnected with the ocean. Bubba Gumps was great for the mandatory cocktail and an awesome sunset view. Could have sat there for hours more even thought the only seats they had left were at the Bar. Mariasols at the far end of the pier was great for an early evening dinner. Frajitas. All the favorites and thanks to a couple of gentlemen singing for ""their dinner"", the music was also relaxing and enjoyable. Great service and although there were a few more Pigeons around then preferred, the wait staff seemed to have a way to get them to move. Would recommend both places for the food and views and drinks. Now the down side. I hit the rest rooms at both places and must admit, had I gone to the restroom first at Mariasol's ... I may not have ordered. I am of the old school that the restaurant can reflect the cleanliness of an operation and if nothing else the attitude of your management. They must get lots of use... but it was filfthy and no toilent paper as well. Bubba's bathroom was the opposite and seemed to be as popular. It just had a clean look and smell and all paper supplies were well stocked.Pier is still a must see. People watching actually changes from afternoon to early evening. And, always fun to watch the Trapeze artists in training and the incoming waves.",safariinsider
50,Kids loved it,"The water was nice and my kids loved playing in the water. The beach is really big. We walked to it from our hotel. There are a lot of homeless people, but no one really bothered us. There was trash on the beach and you have to walk really far to find a bathroom. However, my kids liked playing in the water and jumping in the waves so much that we went to the beach every day.",NMtraveler47042
40,"Way too exposed for me, but beautiful to see","Enormous beach both in length and width. However, completely exposed with no umbrellas in sight when I was there. The Pacific is also cold, so few people were on the beach. However, a great sight from the bluffs of Palisades Park above it and a great place to walk.",Mel B
50,Great place to relax after shopping,It was a LONG walk across the sand to the beach but well worth it! It was a beautiful day when i was there so I lay on the beach to relax after shopping till I dropped at the Promenade and Santa Monica Place.,Daryll G
50,"Neat beach, love the bike path and the pier.","The beach was not crowded when I went, a monday afternoon, there is a bike path so you can bike along and check out miles and miles of beach area. The pier is also very neat. Has a roller coaster and a solar powered ferris wheel. Worth a stop.",Daisy O
40,Much more beautiful than Venice,"After visiting Venice beach we came here. After the hustle and bustle of Venice I was glad for the change. The beaches looked beautiful and there were plenty of people set up for the day there.The original site of muscle beach is now a play ground and has some gym type apparatus for adults too like parallel bars, ropes and rings. I could've stayed here for hours watching the balletic and sometimes comical attempts to traverse the rings (not that I would even have been able to reach one let alone swing to the next!!) one woman was so good she made it look like she was dancing and twirling through the air ring to ring. Amazing.I'd definitely recommend taking the time to come down here.",travel_junkie05
30,Average,"Compared to our many Australian beaches, I do not consider this to be a particularly nice beach. It felt a bit 'grubby' and the water was not clean and inviting. No waves so don't bother with the surfboard. There are some shady characters wandering around so do not take anything valuable to the beach and hold onto your handbags ladies! Typical of many west coast beaches, the beach is very wide. It's quite a walk to the water. Near the water is packed with sunbathers and some areas have volleyball courts set up.",Laurie B

40,Lots of families,This beach and boardwalk area is BUSY! But it's a good excursion to see the sites and view the sunset. Many street musicians and 'shows'. Never really saw any dogs on the beach. Mostly families with kids playing in the surf.,flyby
50,Excellent for cyclists and skaters,Best bike path I've ever seen. Hundreds if not thousands of bicycles a day go back and forth. I've never seen anything like it.,Danny
50,Exciting,"My 6 yr old, loves it. It offers lotsa kiddie rides all for under $20 bucks. The atmosphere is great and you also get a few restaurants to dine in. You can take a walk a walk on the beach or you can swim or surf. Whatever you choose you and your entire family will enjoy @Santa Monica Pier! !!",Stacey N
50,widest beach around,the beach is so wide that you can be totally remote or totally in the middle of the action - walk to Muscle Beach or Santa Monica piers or for the more ambitious Malibu to the right and Venice to the left - like being in a movie with perfect weather and fun people to watch,A W B
30,Beautiful beach...accessibility difficult,"To get to the beach on foot you have to go up and down several flights of stairs and over a bridge. Once on the beach, almost a quarter mile to shore line.Would recommend Venice beach instead.",Kathleen Y
40,Great place to sit and soak up the sun.,"There were lots of people both in and out of the water for quite a distance. A very large beach with lots to see and do, from beach volleyball games to the famous pier. You could even take in one of the Cirque de Soleil shows if you wanted. LOTS to do.",JeanYHZ
50,Nice beach!,"I like this beach , at the morning time i running that , this wild beach,there are no umbrellas and sunbeds, because you need to bring a towel with you.",dania d
50,Is it heaven?,"Just 25 minutes driving from beverly hills. The best choice if you want escape from los angeles. The beach and the ocean is perfect. Plus, the pier is very fun. After you spend time at the beach part, you can go to third promenade street. I love the comfort of santa monica.",Emir A
50,Awesome place to visit,"We visited this place en route to the pacific coastal highway, it is beautiful, had so much fun walking the pier ! Also the walk along the length of the beach was magical. Good photo ops. Would love to visit the place again",Tonks N

50,"If I could live by the sea, it would be here","Our visit to Santa Monica was at the end of our holiday in Sept 2013. What a place to finish on!!We spent the the first day riding from Santa Monica to Venice Boardwalk (review on this coming soon). We would highly recommend hiring bikes, it was a pleasure cycling from the Pier, down to Venice, watching all the characters.The bikes were dead easy to ride, and riding along with the vast beach and the pacific on our right hand side was a toal pleasure. We inched ever closer to Venice, looking out for the characters we were expecting to see, and we weren't disappointed. The first was was a 60ish year old woman, in cycling shorts and a vest top, plugged into her iPod, more dancing along then jogging!! She seemed happy enough. And who wouldn't be on a Californian beach!There are a plethora of shops and restaurants, and bars. Hotels are as plentiful as the characters. Yes, Santa Monica may be known for the unfortunate homeless element, and there are a few of these poor people. However, most keep themselves to themselves, and do nothing to detract from area, in my opinion.The pier is awesome, with a Bubba Gump restaurant, bars, the well known ferris wheel. Highly recommend watching the sunset from the end of the pier, while listening to the buskers and singers.This is truly an amazing place in my opinion. I have not seen much the world, but Santa Monica is up there with my favourite places ever visited, and one of the few I would chose to live in.",RichardChubb
40,Beautiful,"This beach is so nice its vibrant and beautiful, we also thought it was very clean, lots of thing to do like a walk on the Pier and some very nice eating places along the promenade.The downside was we only had a day to spend there but it was enough time to dip our feet in the ocean and walk along to the shops and have some lunch.Would love to go there again for a week at least",Teresa C

Facing the pier the right side gets were crowed on the beach for some reason but it's a beach,enjoy it.",OttonKelly
40,Great place for morning walks on the beach,Great place for a morning walk to just wake the senses. A paved walkway is nice and goes right along the beach. Unfortunate side is there are usually homeless people that have camped on/near the beach.,jeffreybadger

50,Back Home on the Beach,"I visited LA after a year this time in April and this beach was as amazing as ever! I loved it! I have lived in Santa Monica for over a year on the 16th street and I used to be there on this beach almost every weekend and in the evenings! It was a wonderful feeling seeing the wooden pier plunging into the sea, the veteran's exhibition on the shore, the kite flying competition with the dragon kites in the sky, children with buckets making sand castles, the ice cream, the food, the vendors making portraits and yes, this time, making plaster of paris molds of one's face, people drawing miniatures on grains, the people, the noise, well everything! This is one of the most happening beaches on the West coast and an absolute favorite of mine! As the end of the pier, staring into the pacific with the birds flying is one of the most beautiful experience that I have ever had!",ZiaChaudhuri
40,Huge Beach - Weak Surfing,"Beautiful, HUGE beach. If you're a surfer, medium to poor waves. Parking good, easy to get to. Great views.",jbrannellyjr
40,Beautiful Beach,We walked along the beach . There is always something to see of interest. People exercising or doing yoga. There is also a section where there must have been about 40 plus people doing balancing acts. There was also a large crowd round a Michael Jackson impersonator. If you like people watching this is the place to be.,Steve M
50,The widest beach I have ever seen,"This beach is so expansive, it is probably impossible to ever feel crowded. We loved that there were beach volleyball nets everywhere, and Muscle Beach is cool with people doing interesting gymnastics. The water is very cold, so if you are wanting to play in the surf, this is likely not your best choice.",Kim D
50,Beautiful,"Sand and Ocean, what more could you ask. Beautiful views, soft sand and lots of people watching. As busy as it was, it also seemed very peaceful and inviting to just lay on the beach and relax.",Roblyn0718
50,Lovely,I loved watching people work out and use the swinging rings. Be sure to go around dusk to see the people bouncing on the tie straps. Pretty amazing stuff.,Thundanutts
40,Great Public Beach-No Beachfront Access from Hotels though.,"Santa Monica Beach is probably one of the best public beaches in America for several reasons. First, it's huge. Front to back left to right there is just a huge area of sand to play in. Even on a crowded day chances are you can stake out a spot. Second it is probably one of the safest. Lifeguard stands are everywhere and helicopters are always buzzing by, so in the event of an emergency a lifeguard will probably be within earshot. Third, it is well maintained--the sand feels great and there is a water spigot to rinse your feet and body off when you are done. The actual ocean has great waves and great sand to walk out onto. Fourth, there are volleyball nets set up everywhere.Finally, the proximity to the Santa Monica pier and Santa Monica make this beach special. Make a note, however, that all of the luxury hotels in Santa Monica are across the street from the beach so you have to walk across the street and over a bridge to get there. Not a long walk but if your vacation criteria includes a hotel with beachfront access/private beach you will not find that in Santa Monica.",Russell C
50,Beautiful Beach,"We r staying at the Loews hotel right on the beach, and this beach is so beautiful. Lots of good people watching. There are a bunch of yoga spots and places where people are doing balancing acts, and acrobatics. The beach is very large, and the waves are rough. But a beautiful shore line!",CAROL L

40,Santa Monica Mania!,"While many southern Californians travel to Vegas for the weekends, I travel the opposite direction to Santa Monica! I like to travel here because it is a short flight to LAX and a short ground transportation to get here. I like to hang out near the SM pier and usually walk or jog to Venice Beach and Marina Del Ray and back! It is very scenic in more ways than just talking about the landscape. After the beach scene it is a short walk to the mall and the bar ""Yankee Doodles."" After being in the desert all of the time this is my perfect getaway location!Jefferson Lee-Las Vegas",682jeffl
50,Amazing experience,"We stayed in Santa Monica and travelled to Hollywood and Beverley Hills. The whole experience was truly amazing, we had the best time! Santa Monica is vibrant. Be sure to visit the pier, beach and hire some skates or a trike in my husbands case and enjoy the atmosphere like we did. There's a lovely Italian restaurant on the corner by the Holiday inn which was delicious and the night entertainment is great too. Sit back, relax and enjoy and beware the no smoking streets! Dint rush to Marina Del Rey it's scary but the Hollywood experience is a must! Where else can you witness Batman being arrested by the LAPD! Hollywood baby!",swaddy1
50,"Nice by day, not so nice at night","nice family friendly environment during the day time , wasn't so nice once it became night time, alot of messy drunks hanging around, i'd advise once the sun sets and it starts to cool down, pack up and head somewhere else",Dave C

10,"Dirty, Noisy, Crowded, No Soul, Many Homeless","Rented a studio near the pier for a 3-month stay. Had two road bikes stolen within 10-days of arriving in Santa Monica, even with heavy duty locks, and the bicycles placed behind a locked, gated, area. Cancelled our lease after week 5 and can't wait to get out of here. The traffic, noise, and pollution are stunning. The homelessness here is amazing, with desperate people looking through dumpsters for recycles and food in order to survive. Shops and restaurants are expensive, but at least they are crowded... To be honest, I don't know why anyone would want to visit Santa Monica. There are so many other places to visit that are so much better than this living Hell. It looks as though LA and the surrounding cities are in demise as the state of California nears bankruptcy. Will never come back. We all are responsible for taking care of the homeless.

40,Review from a local,"The areas next to the pier (north and south within 200 yards in both directions) are a dump and way over-packed. The tourists and people coming from the inland apparently mistake the sand for a garbage can.As you go North of the pier, it gets quieter and cleaner (any area north of lifeguard stand 10). If you're going South, another semi-less crowded spot to go is south of the volleyball courts at Ocean Park and North of the start of the Venice Boardwalk.If you really want to experience beautiful beaches in So Cal, go to Malibu--Point Dume is absolutely gorgeous but it gets super crowded. Best to get there by 9am and leave when the early afternoon crowd starts rolling in.",DG81
50,"Sun, sand and ocean; what more could you ask for","Our visit to the Santa Monica beach was great. We were able to rent bikes and ride along the beach and get out of the saddle and spend some time in the sand. The beach was clean and easily accessible, wasn't so crowded that you couldn't have your own space and had great scenery while relaxing in the water. This is one of the better beaches I have visited in California.",Moe214
40,Darth Vader on the Beach!,The beach is great. Get there early and stake your claim at water's edge. Most folks are pretty friendly out on the sand. The parking lot and washrooms are another matter entirely. All in all the biggest jerks you will meet will be on ATV vehicles and they will be dressed in black with a riot helmet on with a mirrored visor. It is hard to put a positive spin on these goons for your kids. They ride their little bikes all around in the crowds and try and look in your beach bags and stuff. Really annoying. Bring binoculars and train them on the buoy past the end of the pier and watch the sea lions going nuts out there. Attention soccer moms..............please stop letting your kids run through the sleeping gulls and pelicans.,Ruben C
10,Near the Santa Monica Pier Sucks,Do not swim near the Pier . . go to Malibu or Zuma BeachOr go to HollywoodFailing that head to Las Vegas.,vincemc
30,Eh...,Not super impressed. But the pacific never really does. A little dirty for my liking but Fun for kids though. Worth checking out the pier if in the area.,seetheworldb4ureyes
30,Ok,Interesting for its iconic status but so many sketchy people about. People swimming below warning notices about the high level bacteria in the water. The guide books didn't mention that either.,FelicityKT
40,More cyclist,Did not seem to be many roller bladers around this time but many on cycles of all sorts. Last time I remeber lots on blades and few cycles.It was more crowded on one visit but there was a Circus on and some large tents where events were taking place so this probably attracted more people. The walk around the cliff tops was very enjoyable.,Kenneth P
50,Great Beach,Went to this beach during my recent stay in LA.

Very happening place and parking is not a problem even if its too crowded. There are so many activities you can go for. Don't forget to rent a bike as the beach also has a very good biking trail.",Tanzir M
50,Absolutely gorgeous!,"The widest beach I’ve ever seen – unbelievable! So huge, there is no such thing has not finding a spot to lay out. There is a nice paved biking/walking trail that runs right between the sand, which appears to last for miles. Lots of volleyball courts, of course.

50,Happy Place close to LAX,"At the end of a January trip to sunny California, I returned my rental car the afternoon before my flight back to the frozen northeast and stayed at the Custom Hotel, close to the airport. There is good regular bus service along the old Lincoln Highway from just in front of the hotel, to Santa Monica Beach. It's a pleasant walk alongside the beach, with good inexpensive places to eat. I could understand why Whitey Bulger chose to hide out there.",Eva121036
30,Not as good as it looks in the movies,"Travelling from Australia, I would not consider this to be a particularly nice beach. It felt a bit 'grubby' and the water was not clean and inviting. I also felt as a solo traveller that it wasn't a particularly 'safe' area for wandering around! Hold onto your handbags ladies!",Jacqui M
50,Get fit in the sun,"I loved having a work out on the beach and didn't feel awkward at all. Plenty of people doing pull ups and dips, climbing rope and hanging off rings.

40,"Great for people watching, seemed safe","Our family visited for Spring break. We stayed at the Doubletree nearby and walked to the beach. Great for people watching. Crowded on the weekend. Wide beach, different than Florida or the East Coast beaches. Lots of ""street performers"" out, many looked homeless but not ""in your face"" or scary for the kids. Driving to this part of town is ridiculous. Tons of traffic. Make sure you build in extra time for traffic and parking. I won't be back. There are much better beaches elsewhere.",Mary C
40,WIDE BEACHES,"We had heard and read about the Famous Pier and weren't dissapointed with what we saw. It has a real buzz of activity about it with milling crowds, shops and buskers.Being from Australia where we have the best beaches in the world, even we were impressed at how wide this stretch of sand is. Waves were a bit small on this occasion but the water looked nice and clean.Excellent for spending a couple of hours walking around and getting an appetite for dinner.",speaktruly

40,Lots of activity,"We took a bike ride along the beach. Being from Canada, we don't have such large beaches with so much activity going on. There was a gymnastic area, ring area, rope area, a yoga class going on, karate (or whatever that was...), bike rentals, bikers, sun bathers, a skateboarding area, and the list goes on. It was fun to check out and we all enjoyed it.",Tafierce

30,Spring Break 2014,"Pretty beach but watch out for the clumps of tar that stick to everything. The pier is fun, but they had odd hours when we were there, so we didn't get to ride the rides.

40,When can we go back?,"We got there too late in the day to enjoy much beach time, which is my one regret of our trip -- hope to get back. Looked like many pleasant hours could be spent on this beach. We did manage a walk and were impressed by what we saw, though by that time of the day (dusk), people were packing up their stuff and starting to leave. We had parked at Santa Monica Place and walked to the beach/pier, which seemed to be the easiest way to find parking. I like beaches like this that are close to shops and restaurants so if need a break from the sand/water, there is somewhere nearby to go to. The portion of the beach that was south of the pier was nicer, I thought, that the other side. That southern side has a number of gymnastic apparatus (the site of the ""Original"" muscle beach) which is neat to see how people use for their workouts.",clamc40

40,greaat to walk along this famous beach and reflect and compare to Australian beaches,The wide clean and raked sand. Watching people of all ages exercising from dawn to dust.

30,Differentiate between the beach and the boardwalk,"This is actually quite a lovely, wide beach and great for walking next to the water. The comments about the boardwalk and the 'characters' you see on it are all true. It gets old very quickly, but considering its location it's perhaps not surprising.",JustineYYC
30,some riff raft at beach,I really was not that impressed with santa monica beach. IT is ok but kind of tacky. Riff raff. Man outside with snake show. Belly dancer at end of pier with weird face makeup. A bit of a freak show. It is an interesting place to take kids but not a classy area. The beach is ok. I was interrupted every 5 minutes by people on the beach trying to sell mangoes. Nice idea but I did not want. I saw a lot of homeless people going through the trash. I cant say that I felt super safe there. It was fun going out to the end of pier though. yes the water was cold in march but beautiful weather to lay out in.It is definitely not a Malibu beach but I guess it is worth seeing so you can say you have been there. It is also the end of route 66 so make sure that you get a photo of that marker with the family.,p l

30,Average Beach Surrounded by Santa Monica Fun,"Let me establish right away that I come to this beach more often then any other beach in the area. And I really enjoy it. However, as a beach, it is not as nice as many others. There is the occasional trash on the beach, and usually it can be slightly to very crowded. Beaches in Malibu are much nicer, plus Redondo and Hermosa and even some in Long Beach.What makes this a stop worth visiting is everything surrounding it. The pier and the promenade plus the beach make for a great afternoon or even a full day, depending on how long you have. Being able to walk from the pier down to beach makes for a fun outing. With other beaches, if you go to the beach it's for the whole day. Here you can relax on the beach, walk the pier, grab lunch and do a bit of shopping all in one place. But if you are looking for a great beach, one that's beautiful and peaceful without anything else, then choose a different location.",Michelle R

Hard to believe we were in Santa Monica/LA it was so serene.",mnb22055

50,Nice place to hangout even when you are alone there,I was on a quick trip to Los Angeles and headed to the beach on a Tuesday afternoon.

The beach is quite huge and very good for long walks with your partner and fun activities for the family.,TouqeerAhmad

Clean, white, well manicured beach.",kellypea56
40,"Huge Beach, Quiet, Bike to Venice","We loved a quick trip we made from West Hollywood down to Santa Monica Beach. Public parking was ample and reasonably priced, although be prepared to walk. The beach is one of the biggest I have ever seen - and the walk from the roadway up on the ""cliff"" down to the beach is a hike. Plus, be sure you eyeball where the closest public rest room is located so you don't have to walk too far. This beach is fairly family-oriented and so wide that everyone has plenty of space for volleyball and quietly sunning. Be sure to rent a bike a ride the 2 miles or so down to Venice Beach. Venice is a completely different scene and hosts every kind of weird and wacky exhibitionist you can imagine - and is well worth the trip. Great shopping back up the stairs in an outdoor mall a few streets up from the beach - great place to end the day!",geonat1

It is a curving bay with views both up the Malibu coast as well as views south towards the Palos Verde's Peninsula. On clear days one can see Catalina Island and the freighters that go in and out of the Port of Los Angeles and San Pedro. The beach itself is clean and white. It is a large, wide stretch of sand with waves usually anywhere from two to six feet. There is the Santa Monica Pier for food, drink and entertainment. Parking is in lots along the beach and range from $5 to $20. While at the waterline, you can look back at the cliffs of Santa Monica for some very pretty views. The ocean water is usually too cold in the winter and still a little chilly in the summer. There is a bike path along the beach and various beach rentals. There are lifeguards here in the summer. This is a beautiful place to come no matter what the weather is and can be quite fantastic even on a foggy day. The beach near the pier can get crowded on weekends.",alanmhersh

40,Great beach,"This is a very clean and well maintained beach. It was not crowded and the sand is that super soft stuff with almost no shells or rocks. You can just relax, listen to surf and people watch if you don't want to brave water. And strolling along the path is great, with lots of people jogging, biking and doing all kinds of outdoor activity. I suggest paying attention to the wind forecast. In mid November, the temp was warm, but the wind was up so it felt cold. A light jacket might be a good idea. When the wind isn't up, it can get warm.",Heath H
40,Beach,Walked along a couple of times in the evening. Once to access the pier.Quite a bit of activity going on. Looked clean enough.Didn't really see it in the daytime. We needed more time there.Even in the night felt safe enough.,Allan P
50,So clean and white,This strip of beach is so clean and amazingly white I was gob smacked at how wide the sand is until you get to the water we just don't have that in Perth. The bike path is great definitely hire a bike take your time. It was very hot while we were there but we had lunch near by and we could look out over the beach for a bit longer great veiw you have to go there for sure. We didn't want to leave.,Pinkygirl29
40,Great place for a bike ride,"Rent a bike right near the pier and cruise along the wide, paved pathway to its end a couple miles away. The line of shops along the street, which you'll see from the bike trail, are all pretty grungy, but just cruise past the tourist traps and enjoy the view of the ocean. There are a lot of homeless people lounging about, and the smell of pot was wafting heavily in the air, so use your best judgment before bringing the family on down. It was just my husband and I, and we felt safe.",Capybara22
40,"Lovely, wide, clean beach","We walked along from the pier. The beach was lovely and clean - and really wide! My only disappointment was my husband didn't want to walk on the sand but the pedestrian path was so far from the sea you couldn't see it. The bike path was closer but we got shouted at when walking on that by a cyclist!There are loads of restrooms, very regularly spaced out. You can watch all the fit people working out on the equipment on the edge of the beach - most were quite impressive to watch!",AS185
50,Fantastic hire a bike and ride it!,"A bike ride along Santa Monica is a must do when visiting LA. It was cold and windy when we were there but still sensational! A lot of history along the ride too.Stop for a drink at Shutters on the way back - beautiful hotel, great location (be prepared for poor service!)",Filovestotravel71

40,Pretty damned nice; it always make me think how amazing it must be to grow up with this in your backyard.,"Walkable from my favorite motel. Cool big old pier with restaurants & stuff. This will make locals laugh I'm sure- I love just walking in the sand, though it's kind of hard to do.",Johnsparks
40,A Wide Expanse of Soft Sand,"As beaches go, this one must be up there with the best; when combined with the nearby beaches the soft, light sand stretches for miles and miles. It is also very wide, so there is lots of space for everyone to enjoy themselves. You can use the keep-fit facilities free of charge: swings and ropes, and surfing is safe in the right conditions. With the pier at the beach, it is certainly worth a visit.",IgelEye
40,Peaceful and beautiful!,"Santa Monica Beach is a peaceful and beautiful beach i have seen so far...!! It looks more beautiful during sunset in summer. Enjoy actual waters, shop at the beach and get your portrait done at minimal cost. Loved the experience!",ashmi_nigam

50,Bring a blanket and look at the sunset,We live close by. No competition all over the world. Make you wanna come back the moment you leave. Can get crowded at the weekends but if you want to see the hottest girls in the US this your place! Clean like a pharmacy and best waves for surfers. Do not miss!!!!,Carpediem7114

20,Depressing,"We found this to be a most unappealing beach. Although the weather was warm, the sun was shining and no waves, contrary to expectations, there was NO-ONE on the beach and we felt no urge to even walk on the sand. Poor LA - very sad :(",Trish M
40,you can have it to yourself in the mornings and evenings,I visited the beach in the summer and was astounded to find that in the morning and evening the beach is practically deserted. Enjoy running along its sands in the morning and dipping your feet in the water in the evenings. It is very clean and the perfect retreat from the city life of LA.,waverider681
40,Awesome place to visit,"I went with my fiance and the place is absolutely beautiful. The beach is awesome, only that your towel smells a bit fishy afterwards. Unfortunately we didn't stay for the sunset but I've heard that it's gorgeous. Will definitely visit again.",233angeliquer
50,Gorgeous,"I love SM and visit regularly. The beach is gorgeous with one of the most beautiful sunsets on earth.You have peace, life guards, not much for surfing, volleyball spots and you're near to the pier.",ragdias
50,WOW,Just like the movies! Incredible! The huge stretch from the road to the ocean is breathtaking and a bit tiring! But the quality of the beach was fantastic! A lot of public bins to dispose of rubbish and a lot of space on the sand to enjoy without feeling like everyone is on top of you. Can't wait to go back!,InMelbWeTrust

50,"Words cannot describe, must see for yourself","Whether it be dining,shopping, laying out or even going for bike ride or run, this is by far one of the best places in Southern California to experience it! PCH offers the Santa Monica Pier which is historic offering games and rides for everyone to enjoy. You can rent bikes or rollerblades and follow the paved trail to Pacific Palisades, Venice Beach, Manhattan Beach and even further if you have it in you. The weather tends to drop at sunset so make sure to bring a jacket or sweater to stay warm and cozy while experiencing the beautiful beach sunsets, which is a must as well!",Wrldtraveler365
50,Georgous Beach,I didn't get too spend enough time there. I was only there for a few hours but it was amazing. I would have never left. The beach was very clean and well kept. Everything about Santa Monica was great.,littlebuddy84
40,Lovely sparse sand to just gaze. Being from Australia you appreciate a beach with sand!,Clean and well kept. Lovely for a walk especially in the morning. But best time to walk the beach is at night to look back on Santa Monica Pier.,Loco84
50,Great beach,"Watching the world go by, great for sitting, chilling and soaking up the rays. Very clean beach with so much going on and so much to do and see. Baywatch was filmed here and it was great to see where it all happened.",Darsh73
50,fun at the beach,"If one can put one's inhibitions away at being the only one not in a bikini, the sandy shores and foaming waves of the mighty pacific are marvellous here. Had a blast.",langfam
50,Beautiful beach,We really enjoyed spending time at this beach and just wish our hotel had been located nearer to it (albeit it's quite expensive to do so!).This area and the beach itself is much nicer than Venice beach and you can easily spend a lot of time here. The sea is beautiful and clear and the beach is huge.We weren't too enamoured with LA on the whole but this is definitely a lovely area of it.,cheekyface27
40,Nice scenery ... lots of tourist and safe.,"It is like been in Australia - you feel safe and casual. Good restaurants, nice shops and great atmosphere. Police presence a real plus (well maybe).",TrevelerFB2008

40,"9/28/2013 the ""Glow Dusk & Beyond"" cultural experience","This was a very well attended event! There were throngs of visitors. Traffic was a nightmare! We parked a mile away and walked. We felt the installations we rather puny and too dispersed. It is a challenge to walk on sand as it, throw in the darkness element and crowd factor and you stumbled along, driven by the inertia of the crowd. At each installation, the lines were so l-o-n-g. The Javanese dance and music was interesting but you can barely hear it in the open.As we were leaving the Pier, I noticed a very tall man with shoulder length hair, a full beard, in a long linen robe. I couldn't believe my eyes -- he so much resembled ""Jesus""I gingerly followed behind him to observe. He took out a comb and started coming his hair in the shadows. I took photos from a respectable distance.Soon, others followed and a crowd gathered. A teenage girl pranced around ""Jesus"" and screeched like a monkey. ""Stop it!"" I yelled out to her. But she did it again. People just laughed. A pre-teen boy came up beside ""Jesus"" and stuck out his tongue whilst his friend took a picture. I cringed. I thought the boy was so outrageously rude. ""Jesus"" turned to the boy, frowning. Then ""Jesus"" stuck out his tongue too! It was hilarious. I like his sense of humor.A pre-teen girl came up and wrapped her arms around ""Jesus's"" waist. ""Jesus"" embraced her and petted her on the head. It was so tender and precious!!Who is this mysterious man? Does anybody know?Witnessing the humanity in this ""Jesus"" was a life event for me! Uplifting!",3Kells
50,Nice Atmosphere!,"Most of the times it is hard for a Brazilian, specially one from Rio de Janeiro like me, to talk about beaches located in other countries. That being said, this beach is literally a breeze to evaluate: it is very clean, with a nice infrastructure (the parking is literally on the beach, with many options around it), good sand extension and to top it all: the pier, which has an amusement park and many restaurants, so you can actually grab a bite to eat over the ocean! Ah, do miss the chance of taking a picture near the information booth, where you can see a sign for the start/end of the famous Route 66. I did!",JoeRFreitas
40,The Pier and the Beach are awesome.,"The Pier at sunset is amazing. We played on the beach, watch some decent volleyball, enjoyed the serious athletes on the different exercise stations and ate at a small bar. Love the place!",MTBTrails
50,Lots to see and do,"Did not swim on this beach, but it’s beautiful, with wide sandy shores. Exercise equipment and climbing ropes are permanently there, for the public to use.",Debstar36
40,Huge Sandy Beach,This beach is very wide and very long. Plenty of area to stroll and watch the surfers or just to sit and watch the passersby. It was much cleaner and better maintained than the last visit several years ago.,jegnm
50,Breath taking and serene,There is nothing to dislike about this beautiful scenery. Sand and water for miles and everyone just appears to be at peace. i have always thought of myself has a mountain girl but the beaches sure did capture me.,Jenniferhlv H
50,What a great beach.,"Water's too cold for us, but the cafes are great for morning coffee, the newspaper and people-watching. The long bike/walk trail is the best! We felt healthier just watching all those people exercising.",Mauri S
30,A long way to walk!,The beach is off the pier but if you drive and park you have a very long walk to the water-very flay with little waves so don`t look if you are into surfing-there is a bike path and walking track in the middle -plenty of toilets and change rooms.,Vicki J
30,Very large beach,"This beach is very large and runs for miles. It was very clean, but not many people at the day we were there.",vacationlady1
30,A typical beach,This beach is fairly average and you could see beaches like this anywhere in the world.If your staying nearby it is worth a look.I would not recommend for people to commute here if you aren't nearby as you will be disappointed.,renee n
50,Happening Beach,"Santa Monica beach is one of the most famous beaches in the world. it spreads on both sides of the Santa Monica Pier. Being a beach fan you can easliy spend a whole day here exploring the Beach , Pier itself. and surrounding attractions. there are many activities to do here including one of my favorites i.e paragliding. you can also see surfers and power boat rides. I saw locals playing many kinds of sports here.This part of the world is also famous for fitness freaks, so it is also one of the better places if you like people watching.One thing thought , i went in Late August & it was a bit Chilly for my liking. Take a windcheater with you if you want to make the most of your visit.Lastly this place is officially last point of Historic Route 66",Sharnjit_Sondh
40,Santa Monica Beach abuzz,"Santa Monica Beach, always cool and breezy, is always beautiful! The perennially foggy Southern California coast line was especially clear and sunny on my August visit. Lots of people, lots of sun and lots of fun for my family. Can't believe I left Southern California, but love Texas too!",MMcEnelly
50,The only thing that will bring me back to LA!,Wow this place is amazing! Nothing beats the vibe and culture there is a long the coast. Rent a bike out and ride down to Venice and you'll see all the sights along the way. Have a workout on Muscle Beach too!,jacklutrips
30,Okay,"There isn't much to Santa Monica beach, as a great expanse the beach itself appears quite bleak in places.Also even on hot summer days the pollution/fog creates a barrier to the sun meaning the rays don't fully penetrate below, making the beach a bit gloomy and somewhat chilly.",L13Y
50,Perfect!,"The largest beach I have ever been to and one that is just as you see on TV! It is kept very clean and runs for miles and has acres of space to sit, stroll or bath, perfect!",smedley26
50,Could spend all day here people watching,"Loved the vibe here. Don't miss muscle beach - incredible! We also hired bikes and got as far as Manhattan Beach. Parked easily and paid US$8 for the whole day. If you are coming from LA, traffic to get back to town can slow moving so you will need to factor that into your timings if you have something scheduled when you get back.",London_Travellers_09

40,Looks like a scene from Baywatch,"This beach was just like I imagened. Large manicured sand, lifeguard huts all the way across the beach a nice walk and an outdoor recreation area.It was mid-week when we visited so very quiet. But a pleasant area to visit. A lot nicer than Venice beach which isn't really worth the walk from Santa Monica.",Rowleyal

30,Middle of the pack,"Sure, it's a nice beach. It's very big and has a certain buzz, with the huge bike paths and the volleyball nets. It's certainly way nicer than the scuzzy, seedy Venice Beach. But if you're just after a nice, mellow beach to gaze out over the Pacific, head a couple of miles south to Manhattan Beach instead. It's much quieter, in a gorgeous area, and has some stunning food options.If you're determined to go to Santa Monica then set up on the northern end of the beach, basically anywhere north of the pier. It's quieter, more spacious, and there are stunning views of the ocean and the surrounding properties.",Scruff_UK
40,"Large, open beach","Located at the end of I-10, we stopped here to experience the beach at least once on our last Pacific vacation. The beach was nice and open with plenty of sand. Since it's the Pacific, the water was a little too cold for us to go swimming, even in late May, but that didn't deter our 2 year-old from trying. The Santa Monica pier is nearby and there's a very well maintained bike trail with numerous bike rental locations. If we had more time/older kids, we probably would have rented some bikes. There are some swings and workout areas along the beach.",notleo01
40,Nice family beach,"We visited the south side of the beach to the pier. We parked in a small car park (Lot 1 South) opposite the pier for $1 hour 2 hours maximum from 6.30 am -7pm, but we returned and ticketed again.Nice and clean beach. Lifeguards were on watch and there were plenty of beachgoers of mixed ages. It was to see many families having fun with their kids.We just chilled taking in the views for 3 hours. One of our son's ventured into the water the other was in a world of his own listening to his music.The only thing negative was the showers were either switch off or stopped working at approx. 6-7pm.",Blue30
40,Lots of activities and plenty of sand,"This beach is a fun place to hang out, walk and play in the water. There is a path for walking and biking, a pier with an amusement park, restaurant, fishing and vendors on it, and miles of sandy beach. We enjoyed watching people use the rings and climb ropes, but the highlight was watching the guys do tricks on the slackline tightrope. Very cool!",Lux5

50,A trip to see great friends,"Our families wanted to go to the beach and we choose to go toSanta Monica Beach. The sand was clean and surprisingly on Labor Day weekend the beach was not too crowded. The kids and I boogie boarded all day. The water was a little chilly but your body adjusted quickly, There were no rocks or garbage under the water in the area we were at. The Santa Monica Pier was very close which has a roller coaster, ferris wheel, and some other rides to enjoy. I would recommend this beach to everyone. There is a parking lot close to the beach and the cost is $10.00 for all day parking, otherwise you are on your own trying to locate free parking.",Luv2beonvacation

And the dolphin population is large as well. If you want to avoid the distractions of Venice Beach and spend some quiet time at the ocean, head in this direction.",zadkine
40,Sand without the crowds,"The beach is wide enough and long enough that it's easy to enjoy a day of sun, water, and sand with the crowd or a bit on one's own. The area is nicely maintained and very family-friendly. Lots of parking in the area, and a reasonable walk to restrooms and restaurants.",47IU24L

It is a nice place (and I'm glad we went there) but there is nothing more than on some other beaches. The view from the belvedere is nice.",GabSeg
30,Very cold,"After a long vacation in the USA, we wanted to have some relaxation near the beach so we went to Santa Monica. Unfortunately, it was windy. We assumed the water is cold. The shore itself didn't seem very clean. We changed our plan after all. Overall, going there wqs lovely. We enjoyed the view and the pier. We came by bus so we didn't have to pay for the parking which was a bit expensive. The water is cold. It's an ocean's water after all ;)",Hedddo
40,Nice beach,"I had the unrealistic thought that this could be a nice destination for part of a day, since my time in LA was limited. Was however not the case, since it takes a long time to get there for most people not living directly at the beach. The options you have are to either take public transportation or to drive. Neither one is efficient in a Town like LA, but we went with the bus. Took about an hour from Beverly Hills, even though it's not all too many kilometers away. The car traffic didn't move all that fast either and parking is very expensive in the area. Could be good to have in mind.About the actual beach. It is just Lovely. Long, Clean and Beautiful. Since it is so big and the places around it quite expensive, I'd recommend bringing things to eat and drink. The pier is not so cheap and it's a quite long walk to other places. (Considering how tough it is to walk in sand) I read here that the lifeguards didn't bother people drinking alcohol, which is not allowed, but when we were there the police were checking stuff like that from time to time. I'm not sure anyone got a fine, but I suspect the police might care more than lifeguards.Generally I'd say it's worth the trip to get a break from all the other touristic activities in LA. Especially for all us Europeans who find the Pacific a bit exotic. Allow yourself to have plenty of time and finish the day on the pier where you maybe can take a ride or do some other fun stuff. Enjoy and don't forget the bathing suits!",Paulina K
40,Cold!,"We paid the $12 to park at the beach and just left our car there all day. If you're up to walking, it's definitely worth it. We played on the sand, but the water was sooo cold! We only dipped our feet in, although lots of kids who didn't care about the temperature were getting soaked. We walked the boardwalk, and it was fun to see all the street artists and excitement going on. Some local fishermen almost caught a baby shark at the end of the boardwalk, so that was exciting! We then walked to the 3rd Street Promenade which was about a 15 minute walk away. They have a walking/biking bridge over the freeway which makes it convenient to go back and forth from the beach to the shopping area. We took a nap in our car, and continued on with the rest of our day. We did the ferris wheel and rollercoaster on the boardwalk at night, which made for some fun memories.",Chandra B
40,Very Wide Beach,"Loved riding bikes on the wide bike path, we rode down to Venice Beach and had lunch. The beach and pier are nice, lots of good restaurants near by and the 3rd Street Promanade was great.

Right next to it is Santa Monica Pier where there are many restaurants to feast yourself into while enjoying the beautiful view. This place is also family friendly since there are many rides and attraction at the pier.",TarsierReviews
40,Very cool with rides on the pier yet way to many bodies,"IF you want a little beach space you won't get it here. and best to have some one on the beach with your stuff or it can disappear without you even noticing cuz there are thousands of people everywhere! I suggest you go down a little past venice to Manhatten beach, warmer water, a lot more space and an amazing sunset. Over very nice but just way to many people....if you take a picture youw ill probley capture a few extra ppl in that picture.",Robert G
50,Stopped for dinner on the pier,This is my second time to Santa Monica and the pier. Always so much to do in Santa Monica. The traffic is the only downside to this beautiful paradise.,Michellebenetti
50,lots to enjoy,Miles of sandy beach. Rent bikes and ride through to Venice Beach - or stroll along the promenade. Join in volleyball or just take in the sun. 3rd Street shopping promenade is a walk away...this is a great area to spend the day.,debbietravels510
30,Grandson gets to go to the Beach,"Grandson visiting from Montana wanted to see the Pacific Ocean and have a day at the Beach. We chose to spend the day at Santa Monica, and it was well worth the parking fee and turned out to be a very enjoyable day. The Santa Monica Pier was very close by and offered up food and restroom facilities as well.The only big distraction to getting to Santa Monica from practically anywhere in California is having to drive the 405 Freeway. Its always a massive parking lot. Go early for a nice beach spot, take your sun screen and enjoy!!",biscuitmaker
50,Beautiful!,"Beautiful California beach! Took a long time to actually get to the water due to the beach being so wide but great experience. All California beaches say no alcohol but my party of 4 decided to chance it. We never had a problem, we had canned beer with a koozie covering the can. Lifeguard saw us drinking and never said a thing. Just act like an adult and youll be fine. Great day here!",Zachary S
30,Santa Monica Pier,"Pier is a nice arcade, sort of old, beach is dirty (garbage and dirty diapers). Though it is the original muscle beach wouldnt visit it again",Martin K
50,It is big,"Clean and big! You can bike and running there, you can have sports there. The beach is long, but but you can easily get to the restrooms. Plenty of parking lots with hourly parking fee or day parking fee.",Xiangjun D
50,Stunning,"Such a lovely beach, so clean and pristine. Plenty of toilets and showers and bins and its got so much going on....and also the pier!! A great walk from Venice Beach too!Shopping centre close by and lots of transport",Jen M
50,Kids voted this beach the best!,"The Santa Monica Beach was just wonderful. The kids learned how to boogey board. The waves weren't too rough & the water temp just right. The beach is very clean, never packed. You can rent bikes and rollerblades if that's more your speed. Parking can be a challenge on the weekends. The trek from the parking lot down to the water is quite a workout & bathrooms are a little far as well. Our family can't wait to go back!",CheleAMecca
50,No better place for a sandy visit...,"I have lived in Santa Monica for 25 years and I am never dulled by a visit to their beaches. Wide spaces, well maintained and guarded by Life Guards...watch out for the undertow, it could pull you out to Catalina. Enjoy.",Marcmarc
50,Well maintained--always beautiful,"This is one of the largest beaches in the area. Every time we visit, we find the beach clean and well patrolled. Great place to watch a sunset and enjoy quiet time (away from the pier)!",SabrinaC411
50,Go to this beach,If you are in the area don't miss the Santa Monica Beach and Pier. It is so pretty. There is a walking/bike path adjacent to the beach as well. And the Promenade in Santa Monica is so much fun!,elerado
50,Beautiful Beach with fine sand and great people watching!,"I loved the depth of the beach, the clean fine sand, miles of area to explore via boardwalk, bike trail and just wandering in the surf!",ColoradoKristen
50,Amazing,"In the fall, parking is a lot easier, but in the summer it can be difficult to find a spot, especially under $20.It is a great place to spend a day. You can rent bikes, play in the ocean, take a long stroll, shop, dine or even ride a Ferris wheel overlooking the ocean at the amusement park on the pier.There is a lot of sand, compared to some of the other beaches. A lot of area for the kids to run around in. There is also a trail, which if you walk long enough, will take you right to Venice beach, along many other interesting stops in between.If you are in the area, it is definitely worth the visit.",utopianidealist
50,AND DON'T MISS THE PARKS,"All of Santa Monica's beaches are spectacular -- but don't miss the incredible parks spread throughout the city. Many have ""tot lots"" for kiddies and all are immaculately maintained by a fleet of gardener/landscapers who are dedicated to keeping the parks beautiful and accessible for visitors of all ages.",MMPJMH
50,Santa Monica Beach Scene,"Annenberg Beach House north on 1 , past the Pier is a jewel. Great way to spend a beach day- sand and sea. But, also access to a pool! Umbrellas available - sea views east of the bike path so you can people watch in comfort. Back on the Beach offers cool drinks and good food.",FranChasen
50,Huge Beach,"This is the widest and longest beach I have ever seen. Beware that smoking, drinking alcohol, dogs and fires are banned on the beach, but if you're a human with no vices, you'll love it. The water is a little cold, but the beach is never too crowded since it's so big. I've even seen dolphins from the beach.",Suziselt
30,Better head out to Hermosa or Torrance/Redondo Beaches!,"If you want to avoid the tourist crowds in the summer and still enjoy all what SoCal beaches have to offer, if you want to stay away from the homeless and trash they left behind, or if you want to do what locals do, skip Santa Monica Beach and head south to Hermosa or Redondo/Torrance beaches!",Nanjingren
40,awesome,love this place! biking surfing volleyball gymnastics running and a lot of people watching!very uplifting and active place,geoff w
50,"Vast, beautiful and uncrowded!","Longer, wider and much less crowded than expected. We went there two days, no problem finding a good spot either in the morning or afternoon. Great surf for kids activities - not too large swells, but still some fun waves for body-surfing etc. Good parking, toilet and shower facilities",ErikJSO
40,Clean beach,The day I was there it was not too packed and the ocean was beautiful. There is a large parking lot right at the beach. It was a very nice experience.,rickdx
50,Loved the atmosphere,"It was a beautiful day so many people were in the area. Not crowded so plenty of space to hang around. The recreation area has swings, ropes to climb on, gymnastics bars, volleyball courts, gorgeous scenery and the sun",n w
40,Great Day At The Beach,Had a fun day on the beach at Santa Monica. The beach was fun (but very crowded). We parked in a covered parking garage at 2nd and Main and walked over. The Pier was neat clean and lots of fun. Even the restrooms were clean. Tip..walk farther down the beach for a little less crowded conditions. Food on the pier was very costly so bring some bucks...or pack a picnic!,Anita C
30,Crowded but Interesting,"We are from the South (Gulf Beaches) and it is quite different in California. The ocean is beautiful, the sand is tan, deep, and the walk from parking to the water is quite long (esp if you are carrying lots of things). There were A LOT of people on the beach, more than we expected. It was not a wild crowd, but it's not a quiet, relaxing day at the beach either. There weren't too many people in the water and the lifeguards are very involved in what's going on.",goldendiv
50,Fun in the Sun,A quintessential Southern California beach with many options to explore. We had dinner at Boa's and then rode bikes to Venice Beach along the board. So much fun watching the street entertainers. Then we rode back and watched Cirque du Soleil OVO (Bugs) that evening under a huge inflatable tent right next to the Santa Monica Pier. So much fun!,KCosta
50,People watch all day,"The entrertainment was great so much going on. Always something different wo watch. Nice long walk into Venice beach where the entertainment gets even more interesting! lots of side shows, stalls and bars.",Chris_M735762
40,OK,"Maybe we didn't visit at the best time, as the weather was cloudy and cool. Also, there were JCB's moving sand around on the beach which didn't add much to the ambience",AJW12
50,"nice, fun and lots of room","The Santa Monica Beach is very, very wide with lots of room. Unlike East Coast beaches, the Santa Monica beach is about a quarter mile of wide, flat sand, leading up to the shoreline. Plenty of room for everyone. Vendors sell papaya and pineapple slices, water and soda and umbrellas and cheap boogie boards. It can be very foggy in the morning but sun usually appears by 1 or 2 pm. When I visited, it was never actually hot... sunny and bright but with a very cool ocean breeze. Beach near Casa del Mar is nice but parking can be difficult everywhere in Santa Monica.",Travelr101
40,Great clean beach,"It was very crowded at the weekend but is a beautiful beach, overlooked by the famous Santa Monica pier",LesleyA036
40,Lovely beach,Great promenade and access to Pier with good activities/facilities for children. An enjoyable visit with lots to do. Old fashioned pier,Julesbrown56
40,Pier was good.,Even saw a tv star on the Santa Monica bridge. Other than that was a bit touristy and restaurant was very $$$$.,Susan A
40,Beautiful,"Beautiful place to visit. We went in May this year, so it wasn't as crowded. Go a little later in the morning to experience what the pier has to offer.",KeriandShane
40,"Great Large Beach, just crowded","Santa Monica Beach is a great beach that is really large as far as sand area compared to most, but it can certainly still get packed. Keeping in mind how crowded it is, one great tip is to set up shop on the south side of the pier. On the south side for some reason it always seems to only be half as crowded. You can also walk 3 miles along the boardwalk to get to venice beach. If you are traveling light it's and easy and enjoyable walk. Good beach, try coming on a weekday.",HanKelly
40,Love,I love the beach. I love the water but can you tell me WHY during a heat wave in California was the beach water ice cold! Okay I really do know the answer but I hate that when I come to LA I cant thoroughly entire the beach. Maybe its because I am from Texas heat! But is a family friendly environment although I did see a lady sun bathing nude! LOL! But I was in LA. Great restaurants and attractions like the Pier and the Aquarium. I also love the fact that they have a bike and walking trial connecting Santa Monica and Venice Beach. Very nice.,Kim H
50,Great place,"Great beach...very clean, lots going on..volleyball, street entertainers etc , bike lane etc weather can fluctuate down at the beach. We always go near 'Perrys' ..the other side of the pier..have also hired bikes here and cycled down to Venice beach which is good",ofey
50,Nice views,"Kind of the thing to do while in Santa Monica: walk the boards, people watch, gawk at the buskers, buy some ice cream, ride the ferris wheel...",cote_style
50,What a fantastic beach!,"This is a great beach for the whole family!Yes, the water is cold; that's the way the Pacific works, but more importantly, please wear lots of sunscreen! The sun here is very deceitful: you don't know you are getting a sunburn until it's too late. Where I live, in the hot desert, you can feel your skin burning, so you know to put more sunscreen on or get in the pool. On Cali's beaches, you feel the cool breeze from the ocean, and you don't really pay attention to anything but the waves, the sailboats, and anything else you might not have at home.We brought a picnic for our last visit, but with Third Street Promenade just up the way, remember to take a dressier cover-up, go have dinner, and keep your parking space because the parking lots fill up early... especially on beautiful days like this one!",dgn5cs
30,Good people watching........,"Huge beach -- especially for us East Coasters.......fun to watch the people on the rings/ropes, etc. Wasn't clear if you could rent bikes, chairs, etc. -- had to ask concierge about that. Beautiful beach.....",kewb1
50,santa monica pier,Beach clean but very crowded as well as the pier. Don't know if it was because of the holiday weekend. The pier is small but have some great restaurants.,bryneyes
50,Great first visit,"It was the 4th of July, but I had a great time. A lot of people, but it was a beautiful day. I'd never been to a California beach before, so I didn't know what to expect. The breeze was nice and I enjoyed just watching the waves.",jules_ann_cat
50,Nice beach,"Beautiful beach, nice place to spend an afternoon. Plenty of self-pay parking. It's nice to be able to head over to the pier for a bite to eat after spending time at the beach.",KentuckyOnthego
30,Jam Packed,"Too many people, I would much rather stay at the Pool at my hotel. the only benefit is the later at night that it gets, the beach seems to clear out so head out here later in the day.",Melanie C
40,Worth seeing,Great views and very lively. We hired a bike and rode along bike path. The fair on the pier would be fun for young kids,sohgood
40,Straight out of the movies,"Stayed in a hotel right opposite the beach and couldn't help but admire the view, it's every bit as good you would hope. It's super clean and lot's of beautiful people walking around the place, great for people watching.",Chris C
50,Love it,"Just a 1/4 mile walk to the water on hot sand.LOL. Very nice, safe and clean. Vendors walking around and be careful with the bike road, they think they have the right of way.",findkirk
40,Beautiful,"We took a bus from Hollywood to Santa Monica and it took about an hour stood up on a very cramped bus, however it was worth it. Santa Monica is beautiful, and the beach is lovely. Some great photo ops, and i def reccomend walking all the way along the beach to Venice Beach.",Sarah_11e
50,"Nothing beats the beach on a hot, breezy day","Walked the path and went on the Pier. Nothing beats the beach in SM. Love seeing the fisherman, skaters, cyclists and tourists.",Zach84Jake62
50,Love the beach,I love the beach. It was very clean and easy to walk bare foot along the shore without worrying about stepping on something. You do have to pay to park. Most spots are $12 per entrance but they did have temporary parking for a dollar per hour and thats what I did. So beautiful I would go back.,Sconn
50,"Avoid the pier, but otherwise just brilliant a block either side of the pier","Avoid anywhere near the pier and this beach is California at its best. We just loved how expansive it was, how stunning and how beautiful. We ambled along for miles, so happily, kicking waves. Just ideal.",FBendall
50,Santa Monica pier,Lovely dot and pier beach goes on for miles very clean with enty to do a must visit! The shopping is good to and a great boulevard to peruse,Alw656
50,Great urban beach!,"I grew up in Santa Monica and used to call Station 26 home. So much to do here year round. It's huge though. It can take a good 5 - 10 minutes to walk to the water from some of the long stretches of sand. Such a contrast from Malibu where you might have 30 feet of sand. You can't beat the climate! Mid to upper 70's in the summer and low to mid 60's in the winter. Water is chilly but good to surf and boogie board with a wetsuit. Perfect place to go biking or roller blading. Miles and miles of bike path right on the sand. My 12 year old daughter and I biked from Will Rogers beach (10 minutes north on our bikes) all the way to Venice Beach. So many places to stop by and just people watch. Tons of volleyball courts, eateries and shops that rent bikes and surfboards, and cool beach houses and super fancy hotels right on the sand. The pier is also cool if not for just nostalgia. Super historic pier with probably 50 films shot there. It's also the end do historic Route 66. Spend the day here and have a blast!",Don K
40,Awesome Baord Walk,Rent bicycle or a tandem and ride to Venice beach...thre's some amazing people watching to do there over a beer or galss of wine lol,Damian P
40,The beach is waiting for you,It's pretty good and convenient to fun stuff like the Ferris wheel and amusement park but sometimes too crowded..,WinePrince
40,Nice beach,Nice place to just wander around and people watch and relax. Close to Santa Monica pier which is a must to go and see,Debtrank
50,lovely,we had a nice long walk and enjoy it. the meter is missed up. they only give u one hr...so i would suggest parking somewhere else.,Mich H
40,Not Hawaii,"Not hawaii, but its nice. It is packed though which is not good at all. But it works as a beach, pretty view and everything that youd expect from a beach in Southern California.",Sophie A
50,Great Beach,"Huge uncrowded beach, clean lots of space, but the waters Cold!! Nice walk along the road for biking or skating, clean sand. Very scenic.",dinerdon
50,What Can I Say - It is Southern California Beaches,"It is an excellent place to hang out. Restaurants are close, Santa Monica Pier is right there. If you want to ""see"" people stay on the North side of the Pier. If you want the Volleyball, bathrooms, bikes, rollerblades, start on the South side of the pier. Has a Carousel for the kids of all ages.",Whitakerh
50,Very clean,"We parked on the beach car parks on the walk way. It cost about £6.00 a day well worth it, the beach stretched for miles, not a drop of litter, no dog poo, or sea weed. We walked to the sea, had a paddle in the ocean for the first time, walked along the water edge and onto the pier. had a fab day.",KiRo
30,Santa Monica Beach - Very crowded,It is a nice enough beach but very crowded. Weekends are crazy. Too much traffic and people. Water is polluted.,Azmina K
50,rides and surf,A fave for the little ones and grown alike...the stuff to c and fun to have is endless...ride the ferris wheel with time given. then go down to the beach and enjoy some water time then head back up to the pier...,Saue
50,Picture Perfect,"Gorgeous boardwalk, grab your signifigant other, grab some skates or bikes and go through this boardwalk on a beautiful day. It makes for a great day whether you are local or tourist. Add it to your things to do.",Ryan F
50,Wonderful,Loved the boardwalk snaking through the beach taking you from the pier all the way to Venice beach. Very clean. Very safe. Loved the outdoor 'gym' equipment. Lots of fun!,Jan H
50,What a great beach!,"We were really impressed by Santa Monica Beach. Beach was very clean with beautiful scenery.Walked along the bike/run paths all the way to the pier where we enjoyed the sights and sounds.Lounged on the beach, soaked some sun and swam in the ocean. Water was a little cold as we expected warmer.",Ben R
30,Cloudy Day at the beach,We visited in April. It was 60 F. The ocean looked quite rough. There were no swimmers at that time.,inthegarden
50,Muscle beach,"This is a must to visit, just watching all the healthy people exercising makes you want to get back in shape, Just watching all the different characters is a lot of fun.",Stephen N
50,Santa Monica Beach FUN :-),"Lovely Beach enjoyed the Bars, Restaurants Pier, Dance show, Shopping Centre and sandy Beach everything is nearby with so many things to do. All the tourists mixing and being friendly towards one another.",NicquiUnique
20,Lived here for 15 years,"If you are in search of a beach in LA there are far nicer beaches with cleaner water 30 minutes south of Snata Monica. The problem with Santa Monica in general are the thousands of homeless people it attracts. They sleep on the beach and well...do other stuff there too, know what I mean? Also when there is a mega sewerage problem it's usually with the main pipe in SM, so the water is dirtier there.The pier is great fun and kids love it, the ferris wheel rules.But if you want to seriously enjoy splashing in the waves I would suggest Manhattan or Hermosa Beach. They are pristine in every way! Have fun ;-)",SVHartmann
50,Cool,"Another cool beach to visit, wide expanse of lovely clean sand, easy parking close by, Good life guard coverage for those brave enough to enter the cool sea!",Tim C
50,Sunshine surf and smiling,"Amazing day with friends whilst visiting area. Plenty of space and parking, very clean with facilities and the sea was well manned by the guArds . Great for people watching if nothing else so you' ve got to do it once you've done the pier etc. we had lunch , shopped day before but easy to spend a whole day chilling out here.",Battie1
50,Beautiful,Really liked the laid back atmosphere at the beach. If you go to Will Rogers State Park you can park for $5 vs $12 at The Pier.,Melanie M
50,Clean and lots to do.,Loved the work out equipment and all of the visitors hanging around talking. During our last stay there was even a slack line activity that guys from Northern CA brought and were very generous showing how to use it.,Kelly W
50,A Beautiful beach!,"It's a beautiful beach with so many things to do...simplest of all is to just walk to Venice beach and enjoy the beauty while you are walking.We went there just to spend an hour or so but ended up staying till the sunset and had a lot of fun.Nice places to eat,good small shops and some good rides in the Pacific park.Riding on the giant wheel gives you a better view of the clean waters and huh waves.The beach is one the most beautiful beaches in California...Must go and see it",saumya_Mohit
50,Biking along the beach,"I had a hard time convincing my 16 and 17 year old kids that renting bike and riding from Santa Monica Pier to Venice Beach Pier would be fun. But it was fun and both kids could have biked longer but we had to have the bikes back by 6:30. You can rent the bikes right there on the pier and head out. It's only 2-3 miles long but the people watching and activities on the beach are awesome. You go by beautiful hotels and homes as you head towards Venice Beach. We got off the bikes and watched some street vendor, hippies and total characters for awhile. We did a little shopping and then kept riding. Once we got to the end of Venice Beach we turned around and raced each other back. We hung out on the pier for a little while and enjoyed being at the beach.",Kristy R
50,One of the best white sand beaches in the world.,"Clean, bright, great life guards. Santa Monica beach for some reason never quite makes the great beaches of the world - but it is. The city/county take great care to make this wide beach inviting (groomed every night much like a ski resort) - good vendors and bike path off the sand. Fun waves most of the year.",askworldtraveler
50,Relaxing,"The pier is having a bit of work done, but I wanted to take some photo's so I chose the ferris wheel to get photo's however this was not so easy as I was wanting to go on my own this wasn't allowed I ended up sharing with a lovely couple and their little girl but I still enjoyed it.The beach was quiet but clean as was the pier we relaxed as we walked along the pier and the beach.",Brett C
40,one end is lovely...,"The other not so much. Santa Monica Pier end I would recommend, felt safe and full of people. As you walk towards muscle beach you are faced with homeless people and groups of people sat drinking and smoking weed, and shouting, not so welcoming.",Tammy P
50,The prodigal son,"I grew up in Santa Monica. It's only after living in the Midwest, New York, and the UK, and coming back to SoCal after 28 years away, that i realize what an extraordinarily beautiful beach this is.",LordWallington

50,Huge Expanse of Sand,Santa Monica beach is wide. Super wide. A huge expanse of sand stretching from the carpark to the waters edge. That's a good thing as it is crowded when the sun is out but you can always find a place for your towel.,David F
40,Fun beach to spend a little time,"Fun beach to spend a little time. Clean beach, good strolling, biking and roller-skating. The pier is great! Great little carnival with rides for kids and full of people. This is an historic pier with a lot of charm. We had a good time.",David N
50,The Pier,Kids loved it \the guy at the start with the Mc Caw birdsand all the entertainment on the pier was fantastic,Matt D
40,"Very nice beach, family atmosphere, fun","I had never been to a beach in the Pacific before, I expected a surfer's place with giant waves, instead it was similar to other beaches I know, which is not bad at all. The good things: The view, the sunset, the pier with stores, restaurants and music, the roller-coaster and other rides which I didn't use but which add to the attraction, I liked the style of the beach, something vintage to it. Very clean, families, nice atmosphere, clean restrooms, people having fun.The thing I don't like is the parking is too expensive at 12 dollars. There is a cheaper parking but there was no space there.",DanArg01
50,Beautiful beach,"Great beach with lots of activities happening but still much room for just chilling! Loved the beach cafés, CLEAN washrooms and ability to rent bikes. If you visit you must rent a bike and ride the beautiful path along the beach. Rode from Malibu to Marina Del Ray, stopping along the way in Venise beach. What a day!",Chantal D
50,Lovely,What an absolutely lovely beach in fact the best I've seen in a long time. Go for a stroll before breakfast when it's desolate and at its most beautiful. Super healthy walk away from traffic in Santa Monica.,Lindyloo1
40,Beach Cruise,"Santa Monica Beach was clean and full of sunworshiping people. We rode bikes along the path and saw lots of people playing volleyball and making sand castles. Patrons ranged from families with young kids to couples on a romantic getaway. It would be nice if there were more food choices, but there are only a string of ""Perry's Beach Cafe's"". They offer a decent variety of American and Mexican food, but at a steep cost. A great California beach :)",Regina M
30,There are way better,Kind of disappointed with the beach. Thought it would be fun to let the kids play in the surf after visiting Santa Monica Pier but left rather quickly. The beach was dirty and the waterind of smelled weird. Maybe if we were farther from the Pier it would be better.,Eric Y
50,Great place to watch people,"All kinds of people! Beach was clean and the police were visible giving you a feel of security. It started to get crowded when we were leaving on Saturday afternoon, but the beach is huge and free just pay to park.",kimspony
40,Fun beach,"The beach is fun, there's a small theme park inside th beach. If u had watched baywatch before, their office now become a restaurant. If u going by car, the parking fee is $12 /car. Quite expensive :(.But overall the beach was fun ;)",Vania A
50,Awesome beach,"Went to Long Beach the previous day & this is 10x better, no Snoop Dogg impersonators here & didn't see a single beer bottle knocking about. The beach is huge! Takes like 5 mins to walk across the sand to get close to the sea, there are even showers & toilets/changing facilities on the edge for when your leaving so you can remove 90% of sand from yourself before getting in the car.",Jables89
50,Hot beach,"The sun was shining, it was relaxing and inviting. The beach was wonderful! It was neat seeing the kids play in the sand.",Lise G
40,Cool,"Nice to walk down to Venice Beach, watch the Beachvolley players an the small shops and artists in venice",Jake_Worf
40,Great white sandy beach,Good for a very nice bicycle ride. It is close to a lots of restaurants. The beach area it is really big and pleasant.,Paulo J
50,Rarely crowded,"Great beach with alot to offer. North of the pier is very quiet, south is more crowded due to hotels and easier beach access. You can walk for miles or ride and skate on the bike path. Rent a bike, swim among small waves, tan and surround yourself with beautiful views.",Duke97
50,My office in Santa Monica,"Every day during my stay in Santa Monica at the Rest Haven Motel, I would walk to the Santa Monica Beach, sit down on a bench overlooking the water and make my morning phone calls. I would tell everyone I was in my office, and oh what an office it was. A beautiful beach, with a pier and plenty of activity.",maruke57
40,Great beach if you can find parking,The beach is extremely wide and very nice. The parking by the pier was very expensive though. The roller coaster and ferris wheel are impresive for the pier. I had fun walking the beach walk and visiting many different small shops and street venders. The bike path was a lot of fun and bike rentals are very cheap! A perfect sunny beach day made everything great. I wish I could have found some street parking and not had to pay so much for a few hours at the beach.,Alan T
40,"A pain to get to, but well worth it - use the garage at the mall","The beach and water views are amazing. The boardwalk is a little beat up so if you are a woman I would not wear heels. We parked in the garage right by the mall and it was easy walking to the beach and all of the shopping near by. This is a great place to visit, do a little shopping and have dinner.The only downside was the traffic, we came on a Saturday and even though we were less than 15 miles away it still took close to an hour to get there and get parked.",Dave C
50,Fabulous,Every thing was great. Favourite bar for food and beverage Rusties. The beach was great walked it sat on it and very comfortable. Lots of good places to eat.,Grotto154964

40,Califronia mus a must-see,"I love SM Beach. The boarwalk is a little hokey/carnie, but cool. The beach is big and just minutes from Mailbu and walking distance to 3rd Street Promenade wher eyou can get a great meal, shop, people watch and just hang out. The area is a California experience for sure.",Nicole F
50,Beautiful Beach,"The beach is wide, sandy, generally clean, next to the pier. Have been coming here for more than 60 years.",sdsali
30,Really windy the day we visited,Clear blue skies and high temperatures but still needed jackets so beware. The sea was colder than I expected but it was April.There are loads of toilets and showers on the beach and it was fairly clean.Good parking was $8 per day and worth it.I expected that we would spend the afternoon on the beach playing and sunbathing but after an hour in the wind we gave up which was a shame,jsgm1310

30,From an Aussies perspective,Why would you bother. Says a lot about what the locals like sorry. It is mid spring the water temp required a full wetsuit except for the most enthusiastic kids. Like a bay beach no swell this day with a traffic jam to get there.. Hum,moriac

50,Wonderful place for a long walk on the beach,"I visited the Santa Monica Beach on a recent trip to California and had a lovely time. The beaches were long and wide, and it was a great place for a long stroll along the water. The Santa Monica Pier was there, and there are lots of restaurants and shops there (along with free public restrooms!). There is a lovely park (Palisades Park) right by the beach, which is nice to walk along as well. The only real challenge was getting to the beach, as it is a far bus ride from downtown LA. But it was totally worth it and a great place to spend the day!",SassySarahToronto
50,A beautiful place to dip you're toes in the pacific!,Worth going. Beautiful long sandy beaches. Pier is cheesy and naff but Santa Monica is a fabulous place to to see and visit.

A small number of amusement rides make it also a romantic trip walking the pier or a family visit to the beach. If you want to suspend a few hours taking in the sun and sights, Santa Monica beach is worth the trip or stop on your way.

50,Go here to try the traveling rings...,"Go here to swing from ring to ring like a monkey. There are two sets of traveling rings just south of the pier. Chalk is a must and if there is none sitting around the ring areas, you can buy a block for $3 by the strand where they rent bikes. In addition to the rings, there are ropes to climb, swings, parallel bars, and the best people watching. Fun for small kids up to adults.",Lukeoline
40,Not the place for waves,"Unlike the beaches in Sydney, Australia Santa Monica Beach is a wide expanse of sand that affords visitors the opportunity to kick a ball, play volleyball or other beachside pursuits without problem.The familiar life saving beach towers (as in Baywatch) dot the beach and it is a great place to people watch. There is a long cycle / footpath that follows it so if you are not keen on the very, very long walk to the waters edge you can sit here and take it all in.I did not see much in the way of waves whilst I was there but perhaps that is a seasonal thing. If you are in the area take the time to visit, it is worth it.",missskybird

50,It's fantastic...that's why I live here!,"Ugly days do not exist in Santa Monica, California. That is why I live here. A good friend of mine who travelled the world as a top executive in the music biz has chosen to retire here in beautiful Santa Monica. Actually, it’s been his city-by-the-sea of choice for a very, very long time. He is a smart man. He has long held my admiration for two things: an expertise in precise sweater folding and for proclaiming cities such as Paris to be ‘very nice…but not Santa Monica.’ I have another friend who is an artist who will never leave Santa Monica and claims that she can create her art nowhere else on the planet.Santa Monica is diverse. There is a little something for everyone. Artists live alongside business execs…and seniors rollerblade. We have a Pier and production studios and we feed the homeless. There is an aquarium and a cool library and high-end restaurants and taco joints and 99Cent Stores and organic farmer’s markets with live jazz and pony rides. We are home to Yahoo and MTV and great parks and playgrounds. You can cozy up in a B & B, check out Hollywood celebs at a 5-star property or stay in a family run motel. Bike ride, skateboard, Segway, walk, rollerblade or take the Big Blue bus to tons of fun, family destinations where you will hear French, Farsi, German, Russian, Japanese…you name it…being spoken among the many tourists that visit our coast every year, in every season.

40,A lovely beach until the smog rolled in,"We were in town for a convention and had an afternoon free. We took the city bus from our hotel near the airport (which was something of an adventure on its own) and it dropped us two blocks inland from the pier and beach.The beach was lovely and not too crowded - it was a brisk enough day to thin the crowds but warm enough to dip our feet into the Pacific. It seemed well-kept the day we were there and the scenery was gorgeous. And the tide was at a perfect level for us to find tiny live clams in the sand.Our only problem was when (I assume) the winds shifted and smog began to roll in, making it a bit difficult to breathe. I would check the weather the next time I had the chance to visit and see if the air was going to remain clear.",avidbeader

40,Nice clean beach,I went there with a friend. It is a very clean beach with a nice scenery. At the time we went there weren't a lot of people. What i don't like about it is the access road. You had to actually jump from a sand hip and then climb back to get near the beach or go back to the street. There were also some beggars on the beach whi refused to get some choclate from us and asked for money!,YJO25

20,Not Recommended,"My friend and I spent 3 nights in Santa Monica in late October. The beach wasn't the main reason for our trip. However, we did go to great lengths to find a hotel near the beach.It's hard to put into words but this beach is just too big and commercialized. Maybe Santa Monica is just to much commercialized and touristy in itself. It's probably great for people that live there, and a group of young people looking to hang out all day. but not for someone looking for a relaxing beach experience.The only other comment I wanted to make (and the main reason for this post) was be weary of walking under the pier near the beach. When I walked through, there were several homeless people sleeping and others walking around with bottles in paper bags. It was not very attractive. If you have kids, I would not venture under the pier. I felt more uncomfortable walking under that pier than I did walking down to Venice Beach.",JT L

We actually went to the Malibu beach first just to check it out - it doesn't compare.

Very nice place that I hope to return to.",RNH80
50,A Beach Day,Santa Monica is not to far from me. Its a great beach because when it comes to evening you get the best sunsets there. The walk is a little far from the car so you don't walk to forget anything or you have a long walk back. It is pretty clean though.,buddyone1

40,Lovely Beach,"Me and my friend didn’t actually have a plan to go to Santa Monica Beach. I think we did not actually know what was Santa Monica Beach other than it was often mentioned in the movies. So it took almost 2 hours from the hotel we stayed to Santa Monica by beach. Goal of the day was just to enjoy this day.It was a slow day for us.To be honest, it was just like any other beach. I live in a tropical country so beaches are very familiar to me. However, we have high temperature and our beach always feels hot. The salty air sticks to our skin and the sun shines too bright for its own good. I love the heat but I really hate summer beach. It makes me dehydrated. I am proud to say that we have beautiful beaches in Indonesia but well, we are talking about Santa Monica right now.So the good thing about the beach at the time we went to was that it was breezy! I loved the temperature. We just took a walk along the coastal line and just enjoyed the sights and sounds. The weather was good. I loved it because I didn’t need to use an umbrella or sweating profusely under the sun. The water was cold although I saw the kids went swimming. The wave was a bit too big but well, I didn’t go swimming so it was fine.If I lived there, this would be my favorite place to walk. I'd love this place. We waited for the sundown and it was beautiful! I have to say L.A has one of the most beautiful skies in the world (at least so far). It has a various hues of purple.If you have some extra time, I think I can recommend this place. (Not that I can recommend the restaurants - it's too expensive for a limited budget traveler like us).PS: I visited in February 2009. Couldn't we put our actual year? It's only limited up to one year ago.",crimson_ai
30,Nice beach,"But the beaches further up the PCH are much less crowded and significantly more pleasant. That said, proximity to the boardwalk is key if that's what you're looking for. Parking in and around Santa Monica can be a pain, so get there early in the day and stay until you're ready to leave. Great volleyball nets.",srmwrites
30,Nothing Spectacular,The beach itself was nice and clean. Palm trees while strolling along the beach. Didn't see any bikini girls rollerskating instead a lot of bums. Pier looked run down. Nothing like the piers at the Jersey shore.,sal p
30,No dogs allowed...,"No dogs allowed - which pretty much lets me out of using this beach or generally any beach when down in LA or SM. In fact, during a visit in May, I found Santa Monica to be quite dog-unfriendly, relative to Portland, Oregon, where I live. This may not be revelatory - as Portland is known for its dog-friendliness - including special restaurants (see Tin Shed, Portland). In Santa Monica, one cannot have a dog sitting at an outdoor table... the outdoor table areas are circumscribed with fences or concrete pots or some kind other of barricade. Neither Brutus nor Tinkerbell can be inside that barricade. It's a city ordinance. Oh well.",PatricksMom
40,"Great place to stroll, but no swimming","Gets a little tawdry by the Ferris Wheel and boardwalk area, but this is also where we were able to pick up a couple of post cards to send home, so it had it's purpose.

I see dolphins and sea lions -- I have even seen a whale (only once unfortunately - but it was close and very showy!) The weekends during the summer can be busy but during the week it is blissfully empty and peaceful. Enjoy nature and always watch as there is always something to see!",Joan K

Well worth it!On the beach is the Santa Monica Pier which I highly recommend as well. Walking along the beach from your hotel to the pier is a must do- (although if you have a foot full of blisters, for goodness sake don't wear flip flops!

The surf is up as well! There are great little restaurants hidden just beside the pier, eat well and have fun!",BrookeBoyd
50,Loved our day at the beach,"We spent half day at Santa Monica Beach on a 3 day trip in LA and loved it. We got there early enough on a weekend (11am) to get a good parking spot a little south of the pier. Within a couple hours there were lots of people - but that's kind of the fun of it. If you want quieter beaches head south. That said, there is so much beach that you'll find room. And the beach really is nice and beautiful.We rented chair, umbrella and boogie board from Perry's. I had heard that the water was too cold in So Cal, but it was fine. I got used to it in 30 seconds and had a blast on the boogie board. We caught a weekend where the waves were pretty huge. I kind of over-research on trips and even read up on rip currents which was convenient since I got caught in one despite vowing that I would be careful to my wife. The water was very strong that weekend and I found myself too far out and being carried out further and completely unable to paddle back in. I was thankful for the boogie board to rest on but still a little scary being powerless out in the water. A couple teenagers in the area were rescued by life guards before it got critical. I was able to paddle parallel to the beach until I was able to catch a couple waves that brought me back to the sand - where I rested and then went back in but not above waste deep.Anyway, too much info for some - but knowing a little about these currents was very helpful when i got caught in it myself. All in all, the beach was great. The pier was worth seeing too but crowded. Perry's rented out equipment that made it more enjoyable too.",ICNiT

50,Amazing beach,"Amazing, amazing beach - very wide, very clean, and lets you stroll along the Pacific ocean for miles (all the way to Venice Beach and beyond). Fun things to see (besides ocean) are Santa Monica pier and Muscle Beach (even if that makes you feel a bit of sudden guilt when you think how long it's been since your last workout...).If you're German and in a certain age group, and even if it's not Malibu Beach, you will probably be amused and weirdly excited to see that the lifeguards look just like they did in Baywatch and will keep waiting for David Hasselhoff to rush past.It's fun to walk along the beach early in the morning and see the mix of surfers, runners, bootcamp participants, and yoga fans all having fun in the sand.I was lucky to be able to hike along the beach until Venice for two days on my way to work, which seemed like a mini holiday (even if the office waited at the end of it).Highly recommended.

50,This beach babe loved it!,Coming from New Zealand I spend most of my vacations at the beach either here in NZ or elsewhere in the South Pacific. I also live 10 metres from the beach so I'm a beach afficionado and pretty discerning. And I loved Santa Monica!!! Up until now I'd only visited off peak and it was cold and remote. But this visit was peak season with heaps of people - and this beach is just so big and beautiful it coped with no problem at all. My children loved the surf and so did I. I loved people watching - families from all over Los Angeles having a ball. The hawkers add to the atmosphere and my son got quite excited at the delicious fresh fruit being sold so close to the waves.,Woodyfox

50,Nothing better than a day at the beach,"Santa Monica beach was breathtaking. Not real crowded, they were all on the pier. Parking right at the beach was $12.00 from 8am to midnight for cars. RV's and buses are more $$. Very crowded parking lot, mostly people who can't park straight or in one space. Beach was clean, waves were perfect. Felt safe. The homeless were all up above the pier on the grassy area with their pillows and blankets and belongings. Wish the Police Dept would run them off. Definitely a beautiful way to spend the day!",timsolady

40,Clean Beach !,First thing you notice is that miles and miles of clean sand beach with the pier somewhere in between. If you are dependent on GPS than be sure to punch in proper location like ocean av or 'pier' ; otherwise be prepared for a long walk. Plenty of parking but chargeable. My advice is that if you have younger children or averse to long walk; arrive at Santa Monica Pier. There are rides for children on the pier and other amusement games for payment. Bathrooms are available on Pier but always crowded. There is one restaurant( I think serving Mexican food) on the pier but we did not eat; so cant comment on that. There is board walk and Cycle track near the beach. Cycles are available on rent. A good place to take a stroll on sand and to frolic in the sea. Board serfing is also available . Nice place to spend half day with family & friends.,shasidpra
30,What?,"Want to show off your monkey bar skills? Or see how fast you can climb a rope? Well then come on down to Santa Monica Beach. Just don't get into the water because my friends & I found black oil-like substance on our feet. No matter how much rubbing, wiping or scrapping, it wouldn't come off! It destroyed my sandals. Also the beach could use some cleaning. I mean, seaweed with flies around it? Yuck.",ElectricTwist

40,Huge,"The beach is simply stunning in its hugeness. This is the essence of iconic Californian beach life. The water is however often very dirty and therefore it does not provide a very nice swimming experience. The bathrooms/changing rooms are not nice, but perhaps that cannot be expected with the large amount of people using them every day. The beach in itself is however beautiful, and if you are lucky you can see dolphins swimming by a few meters out.",stefanerics

We thought we'd rent an umbrella and beach chairs but nothing. You have to buy and bring everything yourself. On top of it, the ocean water was chilly and dirty of lots of seaweed and wood pieces. My kids wanted to enjoy the waves the way we see on tv, but they got discusted and annoyed by the weeds. They never went in the water for a second time.We learned that it is the case for all California beaches. What a disappointment.",EscapeFromRiyad

40,Santa Monica Beach is My Favorite in Los Angeles,"While I do visit and like other beaches in Los Angeles, Santa Monica Beach is my favorite. Growing up in Los Angeles, our family visited this beach for picnics, wading and swimming most frequently. Santa Monica Beach is also in close proximity to the Venice Boardwalk, Venice Beach, Santa Monica Pier, Third Street Promenade and Marina Del Rey. Bicycle Paths and places to rent bicycles are also nearby. The nearby Venice Boardwalk is a great place to ""people watch"" because you'll see all kinds of people. This is the beach that I recommend to Out of Towners because there are so many more things to find to do beside swimming or getting a tan.",cgmeigs

30,Nothing Special,"The beach itself is nothing special, though the characters along the walkway are probably the weirdest, and most interesting people I've seen in California. It can get a little bit scary, especially at dusk and at night. The water was wayyyyy too cold, though I did go during the winter season. I've heard it doesn't get much warmer in the summer, so if you want a beach to swim in, I would recommend going somewhere along the US's southern coast from about Texas to Florida!",SamP14
30,Parking SUCKS,Never got to go to the pier since we couldn't find parking...had to go about 3 miles down to the regular beach. This was very disappointing since I drove a long way there.

However, I would recommend going to a less touristy beach if you really want to enjoy it, and not be overwhelmed with tons of people. The water in the Pacific was cooold! A little too cold for me for swimming. However, there were plenty of people enjoying the very cold waters. A nice beach, but I'm pretty sure it's not LA's best beach.

I stopped in a mexican restaurant, but alas it was too expensive, a full meal runs about 15.00 and no lunch specials. Boo. Inside the bar is interesting though. All the other restaurants are the same except Taco Bell. I thought carnival food might be cheaper, but even churros run four dollars. Sigh. Its the Pier. Other than the expensive food, it is a great place to go and spend a day. I went down to the beach and walked along the sand, enjoying the salty air and waves.

Go on the weekends to see the acts. There is the beach itself. For a different unique view go under the pier and bring your camera. Now depending on your lifestyle there is swimming of course, biking which if you go south will take you to the freakiest part of LA, Venice Beach which is the ultimate in crazy person watching. If you like to walk, bring a hat and sunscreen because you will be out in the sun. There are other activities from vollyball to rollerskating, but head to Venice Beach to see the skateborders. Some really talented people are riding the rollers. There's so much to do. But you'll have to work on finding good food unless you like boardwalk fare.",daytripperNewYork

20,I didn't like it,"I don't want to be rude, and I see that I'm the odd one out here with my review (something that would usually make me suspicious) but I went for the first time yesterday and I didn't like it very much at all.My experience was immediately upon entering the 3rd street area (looking for parking to walk to beach) was a very aggressive driving style, witnessed a number of road rage incidents. Then arriving to the beach just before the pier was the largest number of people sleeping rough that I have ever seen in one place. This does not make for a relaxing day for me. It reminds me of the state the world is in and i spend a lot of time wrestling with whether or not to give money, will it do any good etc... Later in the day one chap took to following people up the road adjacent to the beach demanding and shouting that people give him cigarettes. It was just unpleasant.The sand was clean. There was no facility for hiring a lounger, parasol etc...We decided to walk along the front towards Venice looking for a place to eat. We were looking for somewhere not burger and fries but not to the other extreme (Shutters). We didn't find anywhere.The pier was OK. My daughter enjoyed the rides. Lots of birds circling ready to steal your food. Push bikes everywhere, some ridden very badly, lots of opportunity for accidents I felt, and sure enough we witnessed a few. I didn't feel the pier area was particularly clean and well kept.The view reminded me a bit of Bournemouth (not a bad thing)When we finally left, having paid to park, my husband was programming the sat nat so that we could get out of there via the fastest route possible, we were hassled by someone who wanted the space honking his horn aggressively. Just as we were leaving we then found ourselves on the receiving end of another aggressive local ( it was one from each lane of the parking lot at a time to get out, which we adhered to?)We got back to the hotel and found someone had put a massive dink in our new car door. This will serve for some time to remind me of our visit to Santa Monica beach.",SophieG1

Two luxury resorts sit on this stretch of the beach, Shutters on the Beach and Casa del Mar, both very expensive. North of the pier is Will Rogers which is part in Santa Monica, part in Pacific Palisades. North of the pier is also very nice, with beautiful vistas of Malibu and the Santa Monica range.

30,Its sand and water so its technically a beach,"I grew up here on this beach and the beach is great, the problem is the water. The Santa Monica Bay could rival the best tropical locations in the world if you could see more than 5 feet below the waters surface. It such a shame that our bay is so polluted and has always been that way since I have been going to the beach for the past 40 years. I currently live in the most souther part of the Santa Monica Bay and our loacl beach at Malaga Cove has some of the best water clarity and quality in all of the bay and the Los Angeles area, but on a great day that means that you may have 10 feet of underwater visibility. Sad but true. The Beach, another legendary myth of the Southern California Lifestyle.

For the muscle type people you have various frames and things to use to pump up your muscles. Life guards are all on duty. Lovely waves.

I would never leave anything on the beach to go into the water or to take a stroll on the beach. In fact, I would never get into the water because it is not clean.

50,Love it!,"We all adored our visit to Santa Monica beach - so much so, that we made an excursion to return to it at the end of our 1500 mile road trip; for one last lingering look! Cross the road at the end of Santa Monica Boulevard & the most amazing Ocean views unfold in front of you. Clean, tidy, well-populated but still surprisingly spacious & peaceful. Our teenage daughters loved the original Muscle Beach & re-lived their child-hood playing on the bars & rings - all inhibitions lost, just pure enjoyment - priceless! All sorts of contraptions whizzed through the beach sidewalks from segways to tandems - eveyone smiling & having fun. Plenty of opportunites around to hire stuff by the hour & all sorts of culinery delights abounded but in a tasteful way - definately kept more upmarket! Some of the best photos from our road trip are set on Santa Monica Beach - splasing around in the Ocean, whizzing around the Ferris Wheel on the Pier or simply walking in the sand. Fabulous sunsets to boot! Wonderful place, which I'm sure we'll all clamour to return to :)",Zymotic

50,"Big, Broad and Beachin'",Santa Monica Beach has long been a favorite of mine and has been a popular destination for more than 100 years. This is the perfect beach to chill out on. It's wide and lengthy allowing for plenty of space to relax on. Sand quality is good as is the water (unless otherwise stated by local beach authorities). You can surf here and plenty locals do just that in the early morning hours.,Joakim L
40,Nice find,"Were in town for another activity but this was a nice place to catch some sun, run your toes through the sand and water and people watch.

30,an average beach,"It's an average California beach, but I wouldn't recommend swimming there. It's not a place you can really enjoy at night either. During the day it's usually pretty busy, but there's nothing that stands out about it. It's a perfectly fine beach.",Puppetgirldotnet
50,Relax on the sand,"Just go by the sunset, beautiful sky colors. The parking on the Pier is not that expensive (2$/hr up to a max of 6$ per day). Don't even think trying the Ferris wheel, doesn’t worth the price at all. They pick u up for a fast 3 or 3 turns and throw you away...",Red B

Plenty of parking, clean restrooms, outdoor showers. Have lunch at Perry's - any one of them! Rent bikes there, too.",Plumeria D
30,Crowded in the Summer,"For a secluded, more beautiful beach during the summer months, drive north to Will Rogers, Malibu, or Ventura County. This beach seems to attract a lot of tourists in the summer. A wonderful place, however, to walk along the sand on a clear, cold winter day. The crowds are nonexistant in the winter making this beach great during that time of year.",VanessaCalifornia
50,Nice for strolling,"We had to grab photos on this iconic beach - we're allowed to be tourists ok?. We had to see Pacific Palisades theme park, and strolled safely from Venice Beach towards Marina Del Rey on a gorgeous sunny day. You can hire bikes at the wharf if you want, and there's the most gorgeous old carousel at the wharf too. On the main road, and on the walkway along the beach, there are fine dining places, coffee stops or those weird American corn dog things ...and craft jewellery and eclectic clothes stores. If you're in LA, catch the Star bus from the wharf to Beverley Hills, Hollywood and even Universal Studios if, like me, you don't want to rent a car and drive on the ""wrong side"" of the wrong.",velkytatry

40,Very pretty,"LA can be not-so-pretty, but Santa Monica Beach is an exception. The beach is quite stunning to look at. However, by Australian standards the surf is small and once you are in the water the sand is more like mud.

40,Sunbather's delight,"Went every day for a week in July. Got my summer tan! I like SMB since it is HUGE and so even when a million visitors are on the beach, there's still plenty of room. But I would say the sand is nicer than the water. Keep a chair/flag/umbrella near you because beach patrol drives a huge SUV down the beach and you want to be visible from afar. Up the coast (Oxnard) a few years ago a sunbather was accidentally killed this way. Now don't freak out! I love Santa Monica Beach and hope to move back to west side of LA soon (left this year for work reasons).",WestwoodTrekker

50,Gorgeous!!,"This is one of the most striking beaches you will ever find in an urban setting .... certainly anywhere in North America. As a kid, I used to love the beaches of the Gulf of Mexico. And while the best of them are very nice, they don't compare to the beaches of Venice, Santa Monica running up through the Southern California Coast. The only downside is if you like your water warm. The Pacific can be pretty cold, even in Southern California. That said, it doesn't stop hundreds of surfers and swimmers from venturing out in the waters.Sunsets are magical and the constantly changing shades of the water and sky during the times of day make for a perfect place to unwind and take in the best air in all of LA.",Mrblurge
50,clean and clear,"i love santa monica beach and the pier. smells nice,like seaweed not the other kind of weed-that is found so many places. the pier is really recommended. when i moved to santa monica in 1982 the pier was way out into the ocean. i would say double what it is today. early 1983 there were terrible storms that wiped out ,i think every pier up the california coast. i was in santa cruise when the storms blew in and that one was broken too. when i got back to santa monica after 9 days of storms, all the pilings from the damaged pier were thrown up on the beach. i took pictures of the beach at that time. quite a sight. so come one and come all. the pier is 1/2 its real size but is a great attraction",joyce t

The canyon provides a unique view of the Catalina Island (in clear days), Malibu and Venice beach lights at night. It is walking distance from the main shopping center and restaurants. A place not to miss if you visit LA for the first time. The beach is usually crowded during weekends. Nice for running & riding a bike. You can rent bikes near the pier.",EyedocMCO
50,the beach most people associate with Southern California,"Santa Monica beach is a wide expanse of clean sand running miles up and down the Coast. It extends up to Malibu and down past Venice in the South. You can do beach activities, bike along the path up and down the length, hike it, people watch and 'chill'. It is a very wide expanse of sand and a far different personality from smaller beaches in Hawaii or other tropical spots. For the most part the beach is very clean, well guarded by life guards and police but still not a place to be at nite. For a metropolis area beach, it is probably as good as it gets.",Chingachgook

There are lots of street acts who entertain there so you're never short of things to see! Bubba Gump is great for looking around and I picked up a really cute t-shirt and some nick nacks for friends back home.

Walk North to the pier and then to Malibu. Go South to Venice Beach and on. You can rent bikes and I saw some people on segways. I had not been there in two years. They have completely rebuilt the bathrooms. Very nice.",ConnieG26
50,Great place away from the chaos!,"After spending time in Beverley Hills we decided to head down to Santa Monica for 2 nights to relax as we hadnt stopped so far and were exhausted. We caught a taxi which costed us roughly $50 and there wasnt too much traffic luckily!We ended up staying at the Loews Santa Monica Beach Hotel which was located roughly 200m from the pier and main streets which was very convenient! We felt very safe and relaxed around this area which is always good! The hotel was clean and rooms were quite large but of course you have to pay the big bucks to get the rooms with the good views! The internet has a a beautiful pool with great views and pool staff are on hand to take food and drink orders or to grab you an umbrella for some shade! The hotel has free internet in the lobby or roughly $10 for 24 hours in your room.We decided to do a Malibu Stars Homes tour which was fun. We booked that through one of the companies located along the pier. Hilarious guide and a good way to sit and relax for 2 hours and get some good views of the coast!The best part of the trip was to hire a bike and ride along to Venice Beach and then back again down to Malibu. It was a beautiful sunny day when we went and it only took us a few hours. We stopped for lunch at a small little pub near the wharf at Venice Beach for lunch. You must try the Kosher Hotdog with Avacado. To die for! Be careful when hiring bikes near the pier as one of the companies their wanted to take our credit card or passport to hold onto. We ended up using the company in front of the Loews Hotel/gym equipment on the beach. You cant miss it, really lovely guys and great price.This was a fantastic place to relax and enjoy some sunshine away from the big smoke yet still close enough to the city if needed!",Angie D
40,Nice spot to enjoy the sun,"Unfortunately we hit a cloudy day our first day, but the second day was perfect. Nice breeze off the ocean, and the sand was nice. It was about as clean as you could expect. The water seemed cold at first, but we got used to it and took a nice dip.",Heather O
30,It's the Pacific Ocean,I don't surf so I went in for a swim ... of course it was in september so the sea is very rough ! The negative points are that it is a long walk on the sand to get to the ocean and also be sure to bring little shoes you can wear in the water because there is a lot of stones and it hurts really bad your feet. Don't go too far if you don't want to drown because the waves are rough and go in only if you are a good swimmer (I am talking about September).,Tatiana016
30,The Beach is crowded and I still prefer Florida beaches BETTER,I went Labor Day weekend and from what I understand Santa Monica Beach is not the best beach in the area but it was nice. The beach is very crowded but we managed to get a little spot next to the shoreline and froze...it was so cold and windy we ended up moving our towels back away from the shoreline. The current was rough and the water was very cold. I walked in to where the water covered my feet and walked out. Not too many people except for young adolescents were playing in the water. Maybe on a warmer day I'd stay longer and tan.,tomuchpriss
40,Wish they had beaches like this in the UK,"Huge big expanse of a beach. about three hundred yards wide, and taken to its extreme, 23 miles long. Very clean and organised. Signs everywhere saying no alcohol, no litter, no undressing/dressing, no this, no that, no the other, but actually it works. Very patrolled, with life guards and police and lots of helicopters and light aircraft (which becomes a bit irritating) so you feel completely safe, and also you can happily leave your stuff on the beach to go for a swim and it'll be there when you get back. Guys come round selling mangoes, watermelon and drinks as well as beach equipment and the like. The sea itself is wonderful: warmer than the English channel but colder than the Med, with big rollers coming to frolick around in. I was told that there were one or two nasties such as jellyfish and stingray, but didn't see any myself.Finally, being LA, I guess I was expecting lots of steroids and silcone, but the beach was surprisingly full of ""normal"" people.",Putneyblue747

Swimming is great and waves are fun. Only surprise....man was the Pacific ever cool at 68-70F. I think that you can get a script for that though...,Canuck
50,We had more fun than we knew we could.,An amazingly perceptive 7 year old chose this as his birthday celebratory point- we all had such a good time. Relax and enjoy the crowds and traffic are part of the experience.,learningbarefoot
50,Beautiful place.,"Everyone should visit Santa Monica because its such a beautiful place. Its romantic, fun and just gorgeous.",princesspm
50,Beautiful and relaxing,My wife and I went to the beach and we had a very relaxing time. Rent some chairs or a bike and just enjoy yourself. We love the beach and we will be returning to Santa Monica Beach.,traveler2151
50,Beachside bike ride was awesome!,"We enjoyed this beach. There were LOTS of people there, especially on the side that is north of the Pier. South of the pier it didn't seem as crowded. My kids loved picking up the little seashells. This is the biggest (I mean, widest) beach we've been to. It's huge. It's a long walk from the sidewalk to the water. We particularly enjoyed walking to Perry's Cafe (just south of Hotel del Mar a little bit) and bike rental for 2 things. One is - they have really good food and it's right there on the beach. Second thing is the bike rentals. This was one of the favorite things we did in Santa Monica. We rented a couple cruisers, one with a bike trailer for our 5 year-old and two 3-wheeler bikes for my 10 year-old and my mother. It was so fun and relaxing to ride along the beach. Tip: Don't attempt this on the weekend. The trail is so crowded you're asking for a wreck. We did this on a Tuesday morning and it was perfect!",KAHLJH
40,Great beach!,"A wide, long beach with so many good spots to choose from! We went before noon so we found reasonably priced parking right next to the beach (and within walking distance of the pier). There are lifeguards, bathrooms and services (cafeterias etc.) The wind from the sea makes the beach pleasantly cool even when it's sunny (make sure not to get burned!) The waves are great and so is the sand.One more plus: very easy access by car.",SusannaSofia
40,Relaxing in the California sand,"My fiance and I had a nice and relaxing experience at this beach. The pier provided a beautiful view of the ocean and has a restaurant and rides (Pacific Park) if you're traveling with kids. You can park on the pier (for a fee of course) or closer to the beach. We found the sound of the ocean waves very soothing and relaxing. However, the water was cold as ice for my taste! I couldn't adjust to it long enough to stay in and take in some waves. I do have two negatives. The first is the parking. Depending on how late you go, parking will be a pain to say the least. You would think parking for a state, open to the public beach woud be free but forget it and there are signs posted stating 'there's no free parking ever'! You will have to pay at a parking lot of if you park on one of the surrounding streets there are meters everywhere and they patrol/check them OFTEN! The second negative is there are no restrooms on the beach....only port-a-potties! The restrooms are currenlty in constuction so we had to change and 'use the facilities' in the nasty portables! There's no way to wash your hands so bring plenty of hand sanitizer. Overall, I would visit again and by then the restrooms will be finished.",T_luvs2_travel2011
50,Beautiful part of the world,"Santa Monica beach is a really lovely area to visit. Family friendly beach areas that are fully supervised, teamed with a family friendly fun pier with great eateries and Pacific Park amusement centre that has a trapeze, roller coaster, ferris wheels and plenty of other rides and games. There is a fantastic huge play area beside the pier with lots of swings, slides etc to keep the whole family amused. The pier is also fantastic spot to capture an amazing sun set. Having the sun go down over the water is always a bonus, but combine that with it going down being the Santa Monica mountain range with a lifesaving tower in the foreground and LA's smog ( a surprising bonus for great colour in your photos) and it usually an absolutely stunningly magical time of the day, photographically.",Aly0808
40,Great beach with history,"Loved the beach, loved the pier, and it was great for the entire family. The history of films, TV Shows being recorded at the Pier gave it a nice touch.",AthenaP1
50,A world class beach,"We rolled in to Santa Monica from LA, about a 20 minute drive down I-10. We followed signs for Pier & Beach parking, and ended up in a surface lot by the muscle beach. No credit card accepted and it is $8 flat rate (cash) for the day. The muscle beach is a neat attraction, with people doing exercises without weights: Swinging from rings, chin ups, climbing up a rope. The beach itself is massive, I'd say close to 2 football fields from the road to the ocean of sand. Sand is golden in colour, fine but not quite powder. The entry to the water is shallow, which you should be careful of with small children. The waves roll quite far up the beach and this current will knock your little ones down and drag them out to sea, the current going back to the ocean is also strong. Water temp was cool but refreshing. It was windy when we went and there was great surf just ~100' off the beach, great for boogieboarding. The sand by the water, previously occupied by high tide, is perfect for sand castles, just scoop, mold and voila, no extra water needed. The beach is incredibly wide too, and you can walk down the paved area to Venice or Malibu, I saw some folks on a Segway tour that were doing that. The wind made it tough to set up an umbrella to get some shade. I would bring a beach tent you can weigh down or a solid gazebo. The pier is nearby and offers some amusement-park like attractions, but it is pricey.",findcoop
50,Beautiful! A must in LA,"Forget about the glitzy Hollywood trash. When you are in LA, head down to the beach where all the beautiful action is. No trashy tourist stuff, just wonderful sand, great bodies, and excellent shopping. Get the bus to Santa Monica Pier and walk around. Enjoy the carnival atmosphere and then take a leisurely stroll along the beachfront, past the hunky men on the muscle beach, to Venice Beach. Just make sure you keep your valuables close to you and don’t get conned into buying any CDs from “music gurus”.Don’t forget the wonderful shopping in Santa Monica, and the best bit is Montana Avenue. It’s a bit of a walk from down-town Santa Monica, but worth taking the short (5min) bus ride. The High Street style shopping experience is just amazing. Great food outlets (try Nothing Bundt Cakes), great home wears, excellent fashion stores, and a great 1950s library to top it off at the end of the street.",SteveStefan
50,Boshboo GQ-Modell on the beach,"An excellent place to relax or exercise, I prefer inline skating in the evening.",Boshboo
50,Best beach in LA area?,"Wide open expanses of clean beach. Waves, frisbee, tanning, people watching; all good. The only thing I noticed is being european is that there are no chairs or umbrellas to rent on the beach?? So in that respect, stay close or come by car. I'm guessing it's hard to lug a deckchair on a public bus. Plenty if metered parking at many areas along the beach. Recommend having a nice morning there or of course; sunset.",Antony T
40,Peaceful and beautiful,"This is one of the classy beaches in the area. It has a small amusement park and a few vendors, but mostly it's just an impossibly wide beach (probably 75 yards wide) with a bike path, volleyball courts, tons of surfers, and a very cool outdoor gym area. The water is cold, so you won't do more than dip your feet into the surf. But the people watching is fantastic. We used the gym equipment (free) at Muscle Beach and watched people working out with their personal trainers. Very fun.",allen1000
40,nice and beautiful!,"i went to santa monica in september 2010, it is a lovely place, the sea is really cold and i had to make a really effort to get inside. There werent many people in the sea, but there were a lot walking near the pier, i really loved Santa Monica beach and i would like to come back some day and wacht the sun hiding by the sea!!",aroundtheworld---654
40,Very nice beach,"I went to the Santa Monica Beach in January when it was about 85 degrees outside, and I was very impressed. I am not usually a beach person, but the Santa Monica Beach was very clean, and the pier added to it's charm. I highly recommend it to anyone visiting the LA area.",WanderlustV
50,Loved Santa Monica Beach!,"We visited Santa Monica Beach on the first weekend of October. The water was getting cooler, the waves were large, and the crowds were small. The beach was not dirty at all, and nothing besides sea weed was washing up onto the shore. This was my first view of the Pacific Ocean (so obviously my first time in the Pacific), and I loved it! There weren't too many people on the beach, and only about a fourth of the people on the beach even braved the chilly waters. Once I set foot into the water, I got used to it right away and it didn't bother me at all. I would recommend this beach if you like to swim, or even just to sunbathe.",pilotgirl21
40,Biggest beach I have ever seen,"What more could you wish for when it comes to a beach? Santa Monica Beach is huge, clean and nice, there is plenty of room to relax, people watch or just enjoy the warming Californian sun. Water a bit cold though (June). And remeber, you are just a step away from the vibrant boardwalk!",sun010
30,It was okay.,"The beach was not too clean. I almost stepped on glass and I saw a panty liner in the water *Yuck*. However, I like the atmosphere of the beach. It had a fun vibe and the nearby pier and little shops and stands were great. Just make sure to take a bath after you get back to your hotel (you should do that anyway even if the beach is clean).",CaramelSmoothie
50,Loved Santa Monica Beach,"My family loved this area. The Santa Monica Pier was so nice and relaxing with the beautiful water and the mountain back-drop. We shopped at the 3rd St. Promenade which was very nice with great little restaurants. We didn't swim but it seemed very clean to us. Don't forget to rent a bike or drive 4 miles down to Venice Beach. True it was full of weirdos, some I really didn't like around my younger daughter but after you get to the beach itself the sand and water was absolutley beautiful.",Angela71362_8
20,"the good, the bad, the ugly","I was warned this was not a pleasant beach and in all honesty it is. There was litter all over the sand, and all kinds of things washing up on the beach. Plus some parking lots are only open sunup untill sundown. the Pier is the better attraction. arrive at sunset for a romantic night youll never forget. (Guys this is a perfect place to perpose! wait for the sun to go down and find an area with a musical street performer, for a few bucks you may even get them to perform your favorite song) For families the amusment park and games are entertaining. Dont waste time looking for santa Monica soverniers nothing original that you cant get at the airport or anywhere else can be found. In the end visit down the road at Venice beach for swimming during the day and spend the night at the Santa Monica pier.",Passenger36868
