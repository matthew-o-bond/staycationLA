50,History cold war radar site,Some uphill hiking required as it is on top of a mountain range over looking the Los Angeles valley. You would be best to go on a dry sunny day as the trails are not paved,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/218gordond
30,Cold War Central,"Back in the 60s when Russia was perceived as America's biggest threat, this place and others like it in other places in the US, are reminders of a missile war whose time never happened. Can park at the base and walk up to the site. Great views. Interesting. Easy walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PlatinumHoney
30,Tour A Piece of Cold War Classified History,"Ever climb on top of a missile silo? The Nike missiles have long since been removed, but it is still cool to come here with kids or maybe take a date on a hike. Either way, you can bring a picnic as there are tables and a bathroom facility. After climbing to the top of the observation deck taking in Valley views, Downtown LA (DTLA) view along with Santa Monica (SM) and Malibu views you can read all of the signs that explain how the site operated during the cold war.If you are really up for a workout this is a great jumping off spot for the rest of the SM Mountain range. There are nearby canyons with caves to explore. Quiet meditation retreats complete with Buddhist Prayer Flags, as well as enough fire roads and single track trails to fill up multiple days. Hike all the way to Topanga Canyon and beyond.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/844jasonw
50,Great piece of history. Views!,"San Vicente was an ideal location for NIKE missile radar. On a peak 1,950 feet above sea level, it provides vision in all directions. A NIKE-HERCULES missile with nuclear warhead on display with steps to climb on top. Great views!!! This site is a perfect stop for Cold War / Soviet history buffs. It's a challenge to drive/bike/hike to the site, watch for falling rocks. Great bicycle paths/walking paths. But it's draw is the missile display, views, and active micro-wave tower. Restrooms, drinking fountains, bowls for pet water. Highly recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/queenmalley
40,Cool Cold War Base,Went here with a group of Cub Scouts and hiked around. There is not a ton of things to look at and read about - like in a museum. This is mostly an open area in the mountains with a few signs and a couple old structures like the guard tower.It was still a lot of fun to go see and do but you can be done in 30 min. Add a fun and easy hike along one of the many paths and you can have a fun 2 - 3 hours here.There is a bathroom and water fountain but no food so pack accordingly.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dbartoletti
40,Cold War Relic ...,It's great fun to discover this pretty hidden out of the way site and then get to explore the area itself and around it. We drove up but there are also hiking trails that get you there through the hillsides. Nice views up top and pretty scenery all around. Enjoy.m...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dblmed
40,Abandoned Site but Beautiful,One can hike but We went all the way by Car. One could do small hike to the site. Nice to find Picnic Benches and clean Bathrooms up there. Tower (Observation) has about 60 Steps and is worth the climb. Children will enjoy it also. Abandoned site with beauty and history.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sorabh
