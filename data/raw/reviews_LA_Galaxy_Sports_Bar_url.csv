A group of people came in drinks their Bintang, very rude, showed no respect.There are a number of TV's showing, football, rugby, plus a number of other sports.The place had a very good vibe about it.If you are looking to watch your fav sport, do yourself a fav and drop into the Galaxy Sports bar",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trotter101
