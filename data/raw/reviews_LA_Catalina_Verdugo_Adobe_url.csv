40,Nice Grounds.,"We take part in the Passport2History program and this is one of the museums. Unlike the others, this is open by reservation only. It wasn't too difficult though, you just call and the woman who runs it sets up an appointment. She didn't sound too happy that it was only my toddler and I, but she was able to schedule us with another gentleman who also wanted to see it.Probably the coolest thing here are the grounds. There are nice paths and bells, and bridges that are great for a toddler to explore. The adobe itself was cool, but probably the smallest adobe that we've seen thus far. There were only about 3 rooms to see. There was some cool stuff in there... but as far as available adobes go, I'd rate this more an average 3 stars... but combined with the grounds, it for sure gets a 4.

40,"A Piece of History in Glendale, CA","It is a California Historical Landmark Adobe Home built in 1828 by Teodoro Verdugo, the grandson of Jose Maria Verdugo. Mr. Verdugo, a Spanish Soldier, received the original property grant back in 1784. The grant stipulated that the land be used for farming and to raise livestock, and to live peacefully with the American Indians. It is a ""step back in time"" and reflects what life was like back in the 1860's. It's completely furnished with authentic artifacts from that period. I had a very interesting and educational visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobertL873
