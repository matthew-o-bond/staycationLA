50,Majestic!,"I came to the Theater for church (Hillsong) and was blown away by how beautiful this theatre is! The intricate detail on the ceiling is stunning. In Downtown LA, its walking distance from LA Live",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MatchstickLive
10,THE WHISPERS WERE AWESOME!! FACILTY SUCKS,"This is more of a club, than a theater and a SMOKY one at that. I don't know they get away with violating smoking regulations, but they do. I haven't been around that much smoke in years, and I know people can not and should not smoke within so many feet of the doors of a facility. My throat is still messed up from all the smoke. I left thinking that though the Whispers are always great, that this facility is far less classy than they are.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TLB918
40,Its a historic venue that is used for clubs and dancing,I came to the Belasco for the annual Bondage Ball. It was my first time going to an event in DTLA. So I took the metro it was about a half mile walk. I do admire they had respectable security guards and no one was acting stupid ( I appreciate that in a club) Anyway once inside you see the charm and vintage feel of the theater. They have bars all over the place. Since the event advertised multi floors of dancing and it was right. So if you get a little tired of one room go the other one. The other detailed I loved of this place was the AC. It was pumping and I was comfortable all night.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chainsawmadman
20,This is a Club not so much a theater,"The main floor is almost entirely standing room only. There re a few seats but those are mostly for table service. The upper level has theater seating. The main floor is not really suited for those trying to watch a performance. It is crowded, difficult to see even on the big screen and very warm inside. The security line was extremely long and slow. They confiscate chewing gum. I would recommend this for those interested in a dance club but if you want to actually see the show, get seats upstairs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DaydreaminginDenver
