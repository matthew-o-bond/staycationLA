50,"Mama's, let your babies grow up to be Cowboys!","A beautiful experience, full of excitement, and learning. Our two guides (Cowboys) were kind, talented and patient. I rode Jesse, the outlaw (takes one to know one), and survived! The trail was lush and picturesque. I would go back for the whole experience again in a heartbeat.",EAKproductions
