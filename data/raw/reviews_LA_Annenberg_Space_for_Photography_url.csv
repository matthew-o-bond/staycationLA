50,They have a huge 6k movie screen,"This place, first of all, is free. Great photo exhibits as well as films regarding their exhibit. Parking on Sundays is $1. You pretty much have to park there as it’s close to the big mall in Century City but it’s a big walk. They showcase artists, musicians, athletes, etc. huge photos on all the walls. Must see",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Go580299
40,Fabulous space,Great exhibits. Well curated interesting shows. They have an excellent gift shop. It is a nice place to stop after Century City mall,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shazjhb2016
50,"Thoughtful, skillful presentation of coherently-curated special exhibits","I have visited the Annenberg Space for Photography many times over the years, often bringing friends and family with me. It has never failed to surprise first-time guests, first with its modest size (I guess the name makes it sound like a full-fledged LA-scale museum) and then with the remarkable quality of its exhibits. There will be only one at a time, mind you: they change the entire place to best serve each exhibit in turn, and each exhibit might only run for a few months. If you see something that interests you at the Annenberg, plan your visit immediately or you might miss it.And whatever it is, if the description intrigued you, don't miss it. I have been moved to tears of grief, transcendent awe, open laughter, a deeper appreciation for life in all its glorious complexity and nuance. Each exhibit is different from the previous ones. All of them, the ones I've gone to, have been amazing.One challenge: getting there and finding parking. Give up. Just park in the parking garage underneath the big building that looms over the modest Annenberg Space for Photography. I don't remember what they charge, but just pay it. There is no cheaper parking within a reasonable walk anywhere in Century City. Still, the weird parking is 100% worth it. (and the garage itself is perfectly fine, btw, don't worry)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AngelenoNic
50,Favorite photography gallery in L.A,"Since the first time I came I always keep a close look on what's going on in the gallery.. always incredible exhibitions, everything is very well-explained. Love this place!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Stavi2014
50,The Most Hidden Gem in Los Angeles,"If you visit this iconic facility on the weekend parking is free. Hard to imagine but it is TRUE. The photograph exhibits change throughout the year and admission is free. A bonus beyond belief. The exhibits are interactive, a video recaps the subject matter and the photographs are beautifully displayed plus the narrative is enlightening and powerful. Don’t go solo because you will want to share your experience with someone. And across the street at the Plaza are dozen of restaurants and eateries.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cafegirlreva12
50,Photos that take you places!!,"We watched the ""walls"" photography exhibit.This is an amazing platform which brings the perspectives of multiple talented photographers into a single place.They had a short video presentation with insights of the photographers as well.Please do visit. Entry is free and parking is validated. Plan to spend couple of hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/252adityan
50,continues to be a grand experience,"current exhibit is ""walls"" this place always challenges the visitor. it is not just a place to see pretty photos or obscure art. it generally includes exhibits that focus on photography and society. the space is excellent. staff helpful. there is a central gallery where they show videos about the exhibit, and they are always provocative in some way, asking the viewer to engage with the art and artists, as well as the subjects.parking is entered from Constellation Blvd off Ave of the Stars. museum validates. it can be confusing for the first-time visitor, because the museum is basically in a huge office complex area, but staff will guide you. on the plaza level, where the museum is entered, there are restaurants open on weekdays.for architecture fans: as you approach the museum, consider the Century Plaza Hotel and the twin Century Park Towers, all by Minoru Yamasaki, who is most famous for designing the World Trade Center towers. The twin towers are an engineering marvel, if you look at them closely.also, if you are into shopping, the century plaza mall is nearby, with many high-end stores and some good restaurants.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/812jeffreyk
50,"If you like great photography, you'll like this place!","Free entry to great photo shows with varying themes. Staff is welcoming. Introductory videos to help you have better experience. Parking available. Shows are so good, I sometimes go twice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travelmabelle
50,Gives you a new perspective of what walls are for ...,"This is my second visit to the Annenberg Space for Photography. The title of the current exhibition (open until December 29,) is ""Walls: defend, divide, and the divine."" I saw some ads showing pictures of the Berlin Wall and I wanted to see them; they brought back some memories from my younger years behind the Iron Curtain.It turns out that the curators had a much more ambitious plan for us. We got a taste of all kind of walls from the Great Wall of China to some grave South American prisons, including the existing and future walls that separate us from Mexico or walls of the Middle East, separating Israelis from Palestinians.Note that in the video center you can watch a (high-resolution) show that goes through all of the exhibitions' pictures with a short narrative. If you prefer a more individual, personal experience, just walk around and examine the pictures at your preferred pace. The experience is both educational and meditative. I can highly recommend it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cosmopolitan736554
50,Small but fabulous space with GREAT exhibits!,I've been to two exhibits here in the last year and have loved them both!! The exhibits are incredible well prepared and presented and when you consider that admission is free and that they validate parking to $4.50 it's a no-brainer to go.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dijou
50,The Best Photography Museum,"The exhibits are always changing, but each of them ( and I visit there frequently) are excellent. If you are interested in photography it is a Must! You need to park your car at the address location ( which is a large office building), go through the building to the museum which is located in the courtyard. Don’t forget to ask for the parking validation at the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tirzahaviv
50,Annenberg Space for Photography,What a wonderful treat! The exhibit was really inspiring and dramatic. No expense was spared in the presentation of these photographs,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sairam2113raj
50,History of Hip Hop,"A very pleasant experience of seeing an impressive exhibit on the history of hip hop completely for free. The only minor difficulty was figuring out where the parking to the exhibit actually was, but this was quickly resolved. Overall a nice concept and nice place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vdshkolnikov
50,Visual History of Hip Hop,We went to the Annenberg to see the visual history of hip-hop exhibit. It was phenomenal. My son enjoyed seeing the visuals and listening to some of the hip-hop music from the headphones. Well done historical narrative and photographs of hip-hop.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kgo669
50,Worth the visit,"Visited on a Sunday morning for the Hip Hop exhibit, and thoroughly enjoyed it. There was ample parking in the garage (which was validated at the front desk), no admission fee, and while it was crowded, we were able to take our time to see all of the photos and memorabilia, as well as the short film in the center of the space. We were here for about 90 minutes total and were able to walk across to the mall for lunch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amart71
50,Love the Annenberg,"I've seen two exhibits: Who Shot Rock n Roll, and an animal exhibit. Both were amazing. The films were also fun. Free admission and cheap parking, also 2 blocks from the Century City Mall. A great afternoon. My only complaint would be that the space itself is a bit small - I found myself wanting more material in the exhibits, but what they provide is awesome.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leecI8243FE
50,Well worth the visit,This was a great experience. There is no entrance fee and parking on the weekend with validation is only $1.50. We saw the exhibit about the photos taken through the evolution of Hip-Hop. There was a great 20-minute documentary included as well. You could also have a free audio tour for the exhibit. I would definitely allow at least an hour for this museum. It was well worth the trip.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BDarst
40,Free admission and validated parking,Nice little museum at the Century City towers. A place to visit if you are in the area. Just across the street from the Century City Mall.Changing exhibits. Saw “The Visual History of Hip Hop. Many portraits of Hip Hop artists. There is a short documentary that included discussion from many of the photographers who’s artwork was displayed.Loved the contact/proof sheets where you can see the evolution of the perfect shot.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clairef246
50,Impressive exhibitions here! Worth a visit!,SO glad I finally visited about two years ago and have been wanting to go back ever since. I saw their Sink or Swim: Designing for Sea Change exhibition on climate disaster and design solutions for the various problems associated with flooding etc. Absolutely blown away with the quality of the exhibition.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K1737YZjohnh
40,Changing Exhibits,"This is a free exhibit with great photography. I wouldn't make a special visit, but if you are in the area--especially if you work near here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cookpias
50,Small Space Big Ideas,"The AS4P is a rather small space filled with great photo exhibits. The photos, beautifully shot, reflect the ideas, culture and lifestyle of the birth of hip hop. Your visit likely lasts only an hour at best but the outdoor spaces are beautifully landscaped and you are a short block away from the Westfield Century City mall. On weekends your validated parking is only $1.50 so it makes it easy to catch a nice meal at the mall on your visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BoboTravlr
50,A great space for photography,If you love viewing photographic art or the work of other photographers this is the place for you. During my visit they were displaying work from a number of photographer that told the story of Hip Hop through photography. It was excellent!! A brilliant place if you love the medium or not.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/an-old-pup
40,Good but small photography museum- but it's free! Located across street from Westfield,"Really nice space for photography exhibits. Not too large, but big enough to host a substantial exhibit. From what I could tell there is just the current exhibit and no permanent collection, so check the website to see what's showing to see if you'd be interested. Currently it is a photography of hip hop which was really interesting and they do a good job of making it immersive and themed. Really cool huge photo on the outside with luminaries of hip hop and then inside they give you a laminated page to detect who's who from the hundreds of faces in the crowd. Frankly it has become an immersive hip hop museum. The Saturday I was there there was a young and diverse crowd- I'm sure this show is bringing in some people who otherwise wouldn't have been introduced to the Annenberg.Free entry, which is very rare and welcome. I believe parking might be free on the weekends. Or if you are at Westfield Century City it's literally across the street.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SanFranciscoTravlr
50,Great Place for Photography in LA,This is a great spot for photography. The Annenberg Foundation has invested in its future and the future of photographic preservation. Check out the calendar to see what show is on. Well worth the trip.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alexander_Designs
10,Disappointment,Many of our friends urged us to go to the Annenberg photography museum. We checked the website to confirm opening times and days of the week. We arrived at the parking garage and were told that it had been closed for several weeks to install a new show.They need to publicize the fact they are CLOSED and when they will reopen. This isn’t the easiest place to get and is pricy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/123texastraveler2016
50,Annenberg Space - Photographic Excellence,We try to attend each of the special exhibitions at the Annenberg Space - because they are very current & display Photographic Excellence. The recent Cuba exhibition was outstanding & the current Joel Sartore exhibition documenting Animals is breathtaking. The Annenberg Space provides a no cost entry - Super accolades!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dblmed
40,"Small, but very cool!","Though not on the ""must do"" lists, we stopped here on the way to a campus visit at UCLA. The Photo Ark exhibit is very well done, and we especially enjoyed the movie, as it gave a behind the scenes look at how the project was produced.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/weberas13
50,What a great spot!,Went to see Joel Satore's Photo Ark. The fact their exhibits are free is icing on the cake!! Beautiful space and great exhibits.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dianebQ5995ZE
50,Art AND Cinema photo op!,Small exhibition space but very interesting exhibits. We were here for the Photo Ark exhibit. Gorgeous photos. It is small inside though so if possible come during the week and not on the last day of an exhibition (we learned). There is a large part inside dedicated to screening video so we saw the documentary about the exhibit (also VG). And did you know? This art space is in the shadow of the Fox Plaza building (aka Nakatomi Plaza from Die Hard). Whoah.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LAWoman_2011
50,Amazing!,"I took my daughters (12 and 14) to see the National Geographic Photo Ark exhibit and we had such a wonderful time! The space is well laid out, easy to navigate and in a beautiful space. One of my daughters is hard of hearing and they had hearing assistance devices which helped her access the documentary they were showing. We will definitely be going back here to see more exhibits in the future.....FYI - parking is in the building and they validate so it was very inexpensive. And the museum is FREE!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mercedesv714

30,Unique exhibitions,Unique exhibitions. The intro films (usually 20 mins) are a must. Small and manageable museum. Parking is easy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/conniemccreight
50,worth it. #Free,saw an amazing National Geographic exhibit here. Small venue which really gives you a taste for an artist. Urges you to research more and dive into what they were showing. Being free and having a fast moving line even on busy days I would say very much worth the visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Geebee06
50,Beautiful space with quality exhibits,"This is one place to put on your list of things to do while in LA. Free admission gets you access to an attractive gallery that includes world-class photos and a small theater. When we visited in December 2018 we saw Joel Sartore's Photo Ark. The exhibit included a fascinating short documentary of Sartore's work as well as, of course, photos of animals from around the world.There was a photo booth that allowed patrons to take photos with their favorite animal superimposed. Fun for adults and children, and because of it's size, you can get through it with small children before they lose their patience. Highly recommend!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LHD1967
50,Photo ark,Great documentary on Joe Satore. Fabulous photos but not enough! Very photographic site. Parking discounted and entrance free,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lindatA8671PO
50,Fascinating and Unique Place,"Unfortunately, the exhibition we saw is ending soon in January 2019 and I don't know what comes after it. However, I think a lot of effort went into the curation of this one, so I expect the same, exceptional quality. Finally, the visit is free; if you are in the neighborhood it is a place definitely to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cosmopolitan736554
50,World Class exhibits!,"Free entrance to a beautiful photo exhibition that is constantly changing. Parking in the garage for a very nominal fee. Clean, safe, modern campus where you can take lots of pictures of the soaring skyline. The photo exhibit is always fun and moving. Good for kids, if they are patient and calm.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A1742TFscotts
50,Absolutely wonderful every time!,Annenberg is a free venue with free parking...they have the most unusual interesting thought provoking and timely exhibitions...this is a phoptographymuseum and there is always a 20-30 minute film which accompanies and explains the why and hows...my husband and I have been going for years now and have yet to ever be disappointed...inthe back room depending onthe exhibition sometimes it is turned into a Cuban bar or photo booths...and they usually have a virtual reality headset you can try on and experience...another dimension to this great space...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/84trudig

50,We really enjoyed this place,"There are rotating exhibits throughout the year with the current exhibit being The National Geographic Photo Ark, let by photographer Joel Sartore. Joe is trying to capture every living species of animal on camera. There was a 15-minute movie on Joel about his quest with footage showing how he captures his subjects. In addition were many photographs on display of his subjects.This venue is located at 2000 Avenue of the Stars in Los Angeles CA. We drove to the location and parked in the garage right on the property. Admission is free and they will validate your parking for a charge of only $1.50 for the entire day. This place was amazing, well put together and very affordable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SFtravelbugs

Extraordinary exhibits ignite the imagination & stimulate the mind. Truly one of the city's gems...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/have_time_wil_travel
50,Always an Amazing Experience,"I LOVE the Annenberg. I've been several times (Digital Darkroom, No Strangers, Life, and more)... It never disappoints. The photographs are stunning, but my favorite part is always the video accompanying the exhibit. I'm so excited for the Joel Sartore exhibit coming up and am looking forward to the lecture series, which I haven't yet been to! Highly recommend this museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/globetrotting-elissa
50,Always a good show,"The Annenberg is a smallish space, but they use it well. The shows are always interesting. Go on a weekend, the traffic will be much easier to deal with. Parking is validated, but the guard will require you to open the trunk of your car. There is a cafe, some restaurants there, and the Intercontinental Hotel is across the street ($$$$$$). Admission is free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeanjeni2003
50,"Not an Ostrich, the latest exhibit - is a must see!","I love all their exhibits and my favorite was No Strangers. But the current one , Not an Ostrich, features photos from The Library of Congress and it is like history lesson for America. The video go me choked up with both pride and shame.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suzi355
50,Photo Exhibit From The Library of Congress....AWESOME,"Many of the photos at the exhibit are rarely seen. Be sure to take the time to watch the 20 minute video. You also have the opportunity to do a ""story corps"" recording for the Smithsonian. Recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/logjamb
40,Not an Ostrich Exhibit,Really enjoyed all the photos from the library of congress. Venue is small and was very crowded. That was the downside. But it was free and parking was only $1.50. Can't complain about that! Definitely worth seeing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoeyDog

50,The Best Photography Exhibitions in the best space,"The Annenberg is hands down the best curated and most alluring space for photography exhibitions in California. They must have a HUGE budget. Each exhibition is accompanied by an incredible professionally produced documentary that runs continuously, and they will even validate parking, so along with the free admission, it's a lovely way to spend an afternoon. Shows I have loved included the National Geographic 100th Anniversary, Helmut Newton, Refugee....actually, I drive 2.5 hours, and have never left feeling unsatisfied.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WesSDCA
40,Well worth visiting if you are in the area,Interesting excerpts from the Houses of Congress Library and a very informative film on key moments in the history of the US and how photography captured and influenced these (probably of more interest to non-Americans). Not sure I'd make a major excursion just to see this but we were staying in the area and were really pleased we visited. If you are trying to strike a deal with teenage children then the proximity of the very good Westfield Century City shopping centre could be a good bargaining chip.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TomGSt_Albans
40,Compact Photo Gallery - free but beware high cost of parking,"This little gem of a gallery is tucked in between high rise office buildings in Century City. It will be a hike from any garage you can find. Be prepared to pay up to $35.00 to park. Maximize your stay by eating at a nearby restaurant that might offer validation -most of the reasonably priced spots are only open for lunch. Or park at Westfields Shopping Mall in Century City, shop and eat there, then walk over to spend 20 minutes or so in the photo gallery.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/highlandbride

50,Wonderful presentation of National Archives Photos,"This is a wonderful place. We were there for the exhibit of 500 photos from the National Archives and they are memorable. Lots of large blow ups and lots of classic photos shown in shuffling electronic frames.The only negative note is the anodyne film introducing all this in which American history is laughably displayed. Some of the greatest photography in the collection is about the abuse of labor, the great depression, and war -- but it gets an issue avoidant bland treatment.The museum is adjacent to a lovely park like space with lots of places to sit. If you come on a weekend, bring a picnic as the cafes are closed and it is a great place to eat before or after visiting the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Janettravels44

10,Disappointing To Say The least,We went to the Annenberg to see the exhibit of photographs from the Library of Congress. (We found out about the exhibit from the AAA magazine.). We were very disappointed to find out the exhibit was nothing but a slide show and not the actual prints.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SteveTignor
30,"Average little museum, I don't understand the hype?","Its a beautiful little museum w Free admission, It takes maybe 10 minutes to walk all the way through it you are a casual viewer. If you like to read the plaques, maybe 1 hour to complete. Exhibits change often and the staff is friendly.Parking is not easy and you will need to pay and park underground of one of the nearby Skyscrappers. There are no signs once you leave the parking garage to get to the museum, you just have to find your way outside first and then eventually you will find the sign leading up the hill to the small museum.If you are visiting Los Angeles, definitely not worth the trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashleysK4355MG

50,A must visit!,"Whenever I visit my brother in Los Angeles we usually go to the Getty Museum or LACMA, both of which I love. However this time I found the Annenberg space for photography on Trip Advisor and since he had never been he was interested in going also. What a fantastic exhibit. The video explaining the exhibit was excellent and the photos included in the exhibit were outstanding. I only wish that there would’ve been room for more photos. As a bonus there were several restaurants in the same complex so we were able to have a wonderful meal at the completion of our tour. Don’t hesitate to visit this museum. You won’t regret it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/687jeannec
50,Small but Excellent,Enjoyed catching the current rotating exhibit shown in the Annenberg Space for Photography. Visits take at least a full hr. They offer free audio tour devices covering about 14 selected exhibits along the self tour path (must trade ID for equipment). There's also a 15 min documentary video in the center area open theater. Don't forget to get your parking stub validated (parking cost is outrageous otherwise - I paid just $1.50 at the kiosks by escalators when headed back to car).,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jolangfo

50,Really worth multiple visits,"First visit to the Annenberg Space for Photography for the exhibit ""Cuba Is."" We were missing out on this incredible venue. Traffic was easy on a Saturday morning. In-house parking was $1.50 with validation. This is a beautiful complex with great landscaping, and seating in the open air. Great place to chill, especially on a weekend. The Annenberg is actually in two parts within the complex. Apparently, they schedule about 50 exhibits a year. I'm looking forward to seeing more of them.""Cuba Is"" is a well-curated, well-documented exhibition. Very helpful labels are in English and Spanish. The photos seem almost personal, often tragic, mostly sad. The video documentary on Cuba, today, is fascinating, educational, and personal, introducing the viewer to interesting people, both photographers, and their subjects. I particularly enjoyed the combination of photography, videography, and music.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/randylee223

50,must-see on the west side,"this space is a bit difficult to find at the outset, but worthwhile. you park off constellation blvd in century city. thereafter, the signage is poor. head up to the plaza level, from which you enter the museum. it has two parts. parking is validated. museum, itself, is free.currently, the exhibit is on Cuba, a gem of a presentation, part of Pacific Standard Time/LALA. this is a comfortable, small exhibit space with friendly staff. it is well-organized.one of the nice aspects of this museum is the division into two sections. you walk across the plaza, which is a nice break outdoors. you can get food and sit in the sun, if you wish, as part of the experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/812jeffreyk
50,"""Cuba Is"" is great",We stopped by in the early afternoon last Saturday to see Cuba Is. This was a great exhibit. Multiple photographers capturing life in Cuba. It was fun recognizing places in the background having visited Cuba earlier this year. There is a 20 minute movie that i hope to find on youtube or Vimeo as I would have liked to see it again. Admission is free and they validate parking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/craigcN9891HF
50,Always Outstanding,"i have never seen any exhibit that was not excellent including the current CubaThe museum is free, small, validates toward parking and always gives a meaningful exhibition of photography accompanied by a film about the subjects and photographers.Good for all ages",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joanneg28
50,One of the top 10 things to do in Los Angeles,"I just came from the current ""Cuba Is"" exhibit. Fabulous....felt like I had visited the country. As always there is film along with still photos. They have added a second space just steps away. Several good food options are also on the plaza (at least on weekdays). This great venue is FREE. Parking with validation is $3.00 (a real bargain in one of the most expensive places to park). Always check hours & dates as it does close when changing exhibits. I have never been disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ManhattanBeach
10,Cuba is,Great show but seriously disappointed as an international tourist to not be able to pay for coffee with cash .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/992sydw
50,A Must-See Destination of High Quality Photo & Video Exhibits,"First, the Annenberg Space offers totally FREE admission all the time, and advance reservations are NOT required. Second, they validate your parking right under the building. Third, the curators do an absolutely amazing job with the selection of the works and the display and content of the work. This is one of the cultural gems of LA in my opinion. Not only have I learned more about the art of photography from exhibits such as the past exhibit of Helmut Newton, but I have also learned more about the world in which we live.If you are in LA, this should be top of the list for any arts-appreciating person or family. I have taken my friends' tweens here, and they were actually moved by the exhibit. Further, the exhibit we saw provoked intelligent questions from the tweens. Enough said. You must visit the Annenberg Space.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T5193HZmelissad
50,Music and Photos,"I came here for the KCRW free music event. Really enjoyed the food trucks and being able to browse the photo exhibits in-between music. Cuba exhibit now. I hear it's good, but haven't seen it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mapman62
50,Architecture and Art,"One of the finest venture for not only photographers but anyone interested in photography or applied arts.A great piece of architecture right in front of my architecture and design studio on the penthouse across the street.Food, wine and the best restaurant in town in the same block.Must visit. You will be happy you did.Enjoy a glass of wine in the restaurant below.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Getaway730435
40,Something new in Century City,Never knew this was there until friends decided to make a plan to stop in after a birthday lunch out and view an exhibit which was wonderful about living in Los Angeles. Lovely photographs and a 10 minute film that runs on a loop. The walk however to find the place wasn't well marked and then they made us walk about 1/2 block to get our ticket validated over in another building.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/385eileenz
50,Well Worth Your Time,"A compact exhibition space which featured wonderful work by Lauren Greenfield titled Generation Wealth, a nuanced collection of mostly portraits chronicling the adulation of celebrity, consumer culture and money's profound influence on individuals around the world.Based upon the thought provoking curatorial displays done in conjunction with this show, I would strongly recommend taking the time to check the Annenberg's schedule & making it a part of your time in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pookala
50,Greenfield’s exhibition on capitalism and the rich in Los Angeles.,"I really adored this photography museum. I saw the Lauren Greenfield exhibition, her photography showed the many faces of capitalism and the ultra rich in Los Angeles. The exhibition was informative, fascinating and touching. I found the exhibition quite large with a lot of information. If you have the chance to see the exhibition in two separate days, I believe you will be able to take in and appreciate much more. The entrance is free, so that should not stop you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/whyitripped
50,A Great Space to appreciate photography,"We went for a particular exhibit, The Culture of Wealth, which was just fascinating; very well curated and displayed. I believe that they feature one photographer and/or theme in their changing exhibits and I would expect all exhibits to be as comprehensive and informative as the one we saw. I will definitely make it a habit to check out what is happening here whenever I travel to LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ebk16
50,Stumbled upon this gem-what a great experience,Found this museum by chance and wished we had allowed more time. An excellent exhibit on the influence of affluence on society by photographs. So interesting. And gives you a lot to think about.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mommal2014
40,Picture Yourself Here!!!!,We always enjoy our visits to the Annenberg Space for Photography. Particularly enjoy the lectures that are held at times to enhance the photography exhibit. The Annenbergs are to be thanked for offering this wonderful opportunity to residents of Los Angeles to enjoy some of the most outstanding photography exhibits and lectures......it is offered with no charge.. Call or check the website to determine when lectures are to be held,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lovevacationtime

Never too crowded, great Sunday outing, outstanding for out of town guests and family, superb location and FREE!! Motivational and inspiring!!!!Interactive exhibits and videos give you insight to the photography process.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/livingthislife
50,BEST SUNDAY OUTING,"Ok. It is FREE. It is in a off the beaten path location , between office buildings in Century City. It is perfect on a Sunday when there is NO ONE at the office buildings. The outdoor lawn adjacent ot it is specatuslar for lounging . The Space itself is full of inspiring photography. There are books of Photograpyh art on the shelves to peruse. The video theatre is super, and gives context to the collection currently showing. I like to take out of the area visitors here. This is a gr4eat spot to take teens for a family outing. the subject matter is fodder for conversation.My kids are all adults now. We still love to go here togehter.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rng17
50,A marvelous museum of photography,"My girlfriends and I visit museums for our birthday celebrations several times a year for art and lunch. This is a gorgeous museum with very compelling photographic shows, often along with documentary presentations in a very comfortable environment. The gift shop is great as well, and the outdoor area is a beautiful place to picnic on a sunny day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elainesokoloff
40,Nice exhibition space,This is a good place to pop in and see some photography and film. Some good restaurants and cafes within walking distance.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrsirin
40,Nice site to view some great work,"The Annenberg had the DENTITY: Timothy Greenfield-Sanders The List Portraits show when we went. The portraits were large and intimate. We also enjoyed the video interviews that were presented in theater. It was a bit surprising to find this was a one -person show, but still it was nicely done and a very large collection.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Begreen
30,Interesting short stop,Took the kids to this exhibit for about 2 hours and then left. Learned a lot and saw some very interesting photos.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CaribbeanFan79
50,Must do!,Always first class and you can park at the Century City Mall close by (small fee with validation). Just go!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LocalLALALocal
40,Nice way to spend an hour on a rainy day,"In LA on its wettest day in some years, we abandoned all hope of sightseeing and looked for an indoor activity. As a photographer I was drawn to Annenberg. It turned out to be a very modern facility in Century Plaza. It seems to be dedicated to single themed exhibits - on this occasion a series of portraits by one photographer called 'Identity'. On there own I would have struggled to maintain interest, although they are beautifully shot and in an unusual (or rather very old) method (which may not be of interest to the layman). However, the portraits were very much enhanced by a thought provoking film which perfectly accompanied the exhibition and gave real substance and context to the viewing experience. Overall we enjoyed ourselves. On this evidence, If I lived in LA I would keep an eye out for exhibitions at the Allenberg as they seem to know how to put a show on.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rkyprian
50,"Fascinating, classy learning experience","Love this place. And they always have such interesting, thoughtfully curated presentations. Never disappointing and you can go back over and over again and never be bored. And the Broad bores me, so I have a low ""boredom"" threshold!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MANGOphoto
30,"OK, but not what I expected",I was looking for a different kind of photography exhibition but the current exhibits weren't of interest to me.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/flyboy1946
50,Inspiring Exhibit - Visually and In Substance,An outstanding stop in Century City if you have an hour or two. Free admission and validated parking.Don't miss the movie. Seeing the movie first helps to frame the exhibit.We will bring visitors here when the opportunity arises.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoshPhD
50,Great exhibits,The exhibits are first rate and change often.I was surprised at the wonderful variety of exhibits and look forward to visiting again soon.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SMOgal

Very good programming, so many inspiring photographers have gone and share their expertise and experience with the audience. All free! Just make sure you reserve online for the more popular speakers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joyfulsteps
40,A plethora of photos,"I have been there at least two times. Every visit is an experience, much like my travel experiences. The exhibits transport you to other lands and cultures. This is a valuable and important ""Space.""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/notfromla
50,Great smaller museum,"Smaller, rotating exhibits with movies and other audio portions to truly give you a feel for the art/photography and the photographer's vision. Since the exhibits are changed out every three months or so, also a great place to re-visit to see a new exhibit. Have seen many really interesting, focused exhibits at the Annenberg. Can go at lunch time and see quite a bit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NEvisitorfromCA
40,fantastic photography!,Visited here for the Life exhibit by Franz Lating in February. Had not been here before. Very nice exhibit and space!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dziran
50,Free and Fabulous for Foto Fans,"Tucked into Century City's office buildings, the Annenberg isn't the most obvious museum space, but it's one of the most focused and effective. Free admission grants you an immersion into worlds captured by exceptional photographers in exhibits that often deliver powerful political or cultural commentary. And you can walk to nearby Westfield Mall afterward for a bite and discussion.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VeryValli
50,Great night out,Always a treat. Showcases some of the world's best photographers. Sign up early for chance to listen to the amazing stories behind the photos. A great way to be transported around the world through some very magical eyes,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/roxyrae
50,Photography Exhibitions with Changing Topic in Depth,"This is a wonderful space. It has a few exhibitions a year. Each exhibition focuses on one topic with great photography and a constantly running short film on the subject. The subject range is as diverse as Who Shot Rock & Roll (great Rock photos), to Celebration of 125 Years of National Geographic Photography, to Refuges, to . . (you get it.), The space is small, so depending on your depth, it will take 30-90 minutes. It is free and there is parking less than $5 in nearby garage. (Clean your truck . . they check it so you can enter the garage!) The photos are captioned, there are not audio tours. However, the small back room, typically has headsets for each photo. It is a relaxing space to wander at your own pace. For those of us that have become casual photographer . . now that we all have cameras with us ALL the time, it is nice to see what really creates a captivating photo.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IreneDJ2
50,Exhibition on photos of refugee,"Wonderful layout of photos of refugees around the world- including new Americans- until August 21st. Brave, heart wrenching, and hopeful faces and stories.

I enjoyed the exhibit and hope to see more in the future.Parking is available in the underground lot (I think it's free or seriously discounted with a validation from the Annenberg).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StaziaW1
50,Extremely important photographs that will move you!,"We recently went to the ""Refugee"" exhibit. We were deeply moved by the photographs taken of people in many different countries who are living in terrible conditions in refugee camps. The pictures told amazing stories of resilience, suffering, and humanity. Viewing the pictures expanding my understanding of the refugee crisis throughout the world. The museum is free and exhibits are rotating. Check the website for more information.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P9218BCchrisb

50,Emotional. Beautiful.,"The Refugee exhibit was fantastic. The stories and views of the photographers pulled on my heart strings. The one quote said ""never take for granted being able to go home."" For these people will never be able to do that again. After vacationing here for just a few days I am ready to go back to the comforts of my own home so that is a concept that breaks my heart. What a brilliant way to shed light on the world. Next door at Skylight you can follow up with them as they settle into their ""new"" lives. Well worth a visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/151taral

Admissions to gallery is free. Recommended.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OBD2142
50,Innovative and superb photography museum,I try to never miss an exhibition here my favorite museum in LA. This space is all about photography and doesn't care about museum convention. They always have a well produced film to compliment the exhibition. The current exhibition on refugees has lots of interactive content including a Virtual reality experience designed around students in Columbia. The space has expanded to include an annex across the way where they have lectures and exhibits. Free admission and they even mostly cover the parking. One of my favorite places in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JKPImageFusion
50,Great Exhibits,"This gallery is a hidden gem. Located in Century city, They have had exhibits on rock and roll, Photography, and much more. It is best to make a reservation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lshaw3010
50,Tremendously Engaging,"Wonderful photo exhibit on display now depicting refugee crisis, done with photos from several different photographers in different regions of the world and a documentary film telling the story of these photographers as they collected their photos.

This space is kinda hidden away in Century City--we came on the weekend to avoid the business crush/traffic during the week.Smallish space with an awesome exhibitWe finally made it to the Annenberg for the ""Refugee"" exhibit. Amazing, inspiring and emotional. If you see anything this year, see this exhibit and visit the space here.Yes yes yes",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Summerasalifestyle
50,New Event titled Refugees,"The Annenberg opened a new event titled Refugees. I went on opening day and took a friend who has never been to the Annenberg and it is amazing photo exhibit which will be there until August 21, 2016. I recommend everyone to try and go see this Exhibit. The Annenberg Foundation does so much to give to the arts. We are applaud you Annenberg for giving back and allowing us to take advantage of the work you do and letting us enjoy it. Thank you",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dqueen1

50,"Great Photography, Cool Space & Free!","Wonderful place to stop in for an hour or so and take in the then-current exhibit. It is a little hard to find, especially in a rain storm, but don't give up. Great attraction, and not just for photographers in your group. We also enjoyed the reference library/reading space towards the back of the building with lots of free books/info to peruse in a very peaceful setting. Definitely worth a visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/weathermankc
50,A Jewel,The Annenburg Space for Photography does an incredible job of showing the beauty and power of photography. The exits change every few months so it's worth many visits.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CaFrancophile
50,Great to do with the out of town guests,These people are smart. Each show I have visited has been worth the trip. Very thoughtful curating takes place at Annenberg Space. I took the in-laws and they loved the show. The parking is tricky...but that is true of any building in Century City. You miss the entrance and you have to drive to hell and back to get in again. Go to their website to confirm the best way to approach the parking lot.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TracyHawaii
50,Amazing way to spend our last morning in LA,We were fortunate enough to visit when Life: A journey through time documentary and photography exhibition was on. Breathtaking photography and an extremely interesting and moving documentary by Frans Lanting from the big bang through time. This is a free exhibition with free audio handset tours too. Excellent way to spend an hour and soak up culture in a nice part of LA. Parking is under neath the building only $3 but you must get your ticket stamped in the reception and the exit barrier machines only take cards not cash.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/evans2012
50,One of my favorite spots in L.A.,"This space is like the Goldilocks of museum/art spaces. It isn't too big and it's not too small, but it is just the right size to feel like you saw something great, were able to take it all in and not be too overwhelmed. The exhibits which are all photo exhibits are always truly fantastic. They tell a great story and help bring awareness to global and world issues through visually stunning pictures. The cherry on top?...its FREEEEEEE! Run, don't walk to this gem of a cultural space, I think you'll be happy you did.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ducduc

50,A must for a LA visit,"Although I have not been to LA for 2 years, this is a must stop on every visit. Besides the spectacular changing show, the visit is free except for parking which you do get a validated rate.All I can say is GO!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MisterKenn
40,1st Visit to Annenberg Space for Photography,This was our 1st Visit to Annenberg Space for Photography. I didn't even know it was there until I saw it was mentioned by another photographer. The We went on a Sunday at 11am when it first opened and I would highly recommend going on that day of the week. The parking lot was empty so you could park on P1 near the elevators. You don't have to fight the normally heavy traffic in Century City nor the business people in the plaza. The exhibit is laid out well and nice visually. We were disappointed there was only one photographer exhibited as we expected to see more in a large gallery. The video presentation was nice and we enjoyed all the books in the library area. Afterwards we went over to the Skylight gallery. Would definitely recommend if you are in the area and a photographer.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/439garyt
50,Wonderful,"This was a great little space for anyone at all interested in photography. The staff is incredibly friendly and their love of photography is infectious. Both the Frans Lanting “Life” exhibit and the Pearls of the Planet by explore.org installation at the Skylight are excellent. It was a little confusing for an out of towner to find the spaces, but it is well worth searching out this delightful space for an hour or two when in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dupetersentravel
50,Great find for exceptional exhibits,"We just came back from seeing another exhibit at the Annenberg and are so glad that we didn't miss this one. Frans Lanting is an award winning photographer whose work is fascinating and exciting. If anyone can inspire you to pick up a camera, it would be him. This exhibit is for any age and is free admission. Our other favorite was ""Who Shot Rock and Roll"". The photography surrounds a center area that has 2 screens displaying the background of the exhibit. The parking seems a bit intimidating (only $1 with validation), but just follow the directions and work your way to the Annenberg.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/greeneyes7449
50,Petite Gem,"This place puts up the best photography exhibits. All in a small venue. And, it's all free other than for the parking unless you come on the weekends. Highly recommended. You only need a couple of hours; of course, feel free to linger too. And, don't forget about the annex across the courtyard.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wing49er
50,Great Photography,"My wife, son and I recently went to this Los Angeles attraction. The center is free and the photography is absolutely first-rate. We saw a fantastic exhibit of Frans Lanting's wildlife photography and it was simply stunning. I heartily recommend this place to anyone visiting Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/irawine
50,A elightful surprise,"Set behind Century City's twin towers is a FREE jewl box of photographic art, elegantly and tastefully presented, with supporting film narratives. Absolutely worth the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SteveVienna_Austria
50,"Must see, even if you are not in to photography !","This photography exhibition is truly beautiful. Titled ' LIFE', a monumental work by Frans Lanting, is not only a visual treat but a stimulus to learn more for the curious mind.It is accompanied by a 22 minute video in photographer's own words explaining his journey and the passion for the medium. The video can make us aware of Lanting's arduous yet breath taking work of a life time; specifically depicting the time-line of evolution through his photographs.Also the video specifically serves well as a prelude to viewing the mounted pictures, thus enhances the experience.The exhibit itself is well curated and beautifully presented for all to enjoy and a must for the student of evolution for that additional visual treat.Museum staff is very pleasant and helpful. This exhibit will run till March 2016. Needless to say, I will be visiting this once more.The parking when validated costs mere $3.50 / 3 hours on weekdays and $1 on Sat/Sun. The museum is closed on Mon./Tue.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/laymya
50,Fascinating exhibit space,"If you're into photography this is a must. Even if you're not, the exhibits are worthwhile. And it's free !!We went at the recommendation of the doctor we were visiting whose office is nearby. He told us all about it. The exhibits change every few months. At the moment, the exhibit ""Life"" is a set of photos by National Geographic photographer Frans Lanting. He captured beautiful images of life as it's evolved on earth. I won't explain that statement, you need to see the exhibits.Don't just look at the photos - be sure to watch the video. A visit should take a little as 30 minutes to 90 minutes. Not much longer. But spend a few minutes at the gift store. Prices are just ok. Not a surprise for a gift shop. But the selection is fun.There is another part of the space on the other side of the square. It was closed for a private function so I can't comment on it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RichardMFromToronto

30,Watch this Space! Between a 3 and 4,"LA has finally gotten a photography space, and while not perfect, there is quite a bit to like about it.On my visit in Dec 2015 (my first) National Geo photographer Hans Lanting was on display. I am into photography, more people-oriented and less so nature and natural scenes, but this was wondrous. Credit Lanting, for sure, but the photos were very well presented in this relatively small space, plus good use of film especially in the projection room. It is a puzzle why the center didn't simply build a larger facility, though part of Lanting's work was also presented outside in an arresting row of small billboards viewed as you walked toward the entrance. There is also a separate small facility adjacent which was at this time filled with Arctic...scenes, not quite sure the logic of this show, which had some striking film but seemed to be confused as to whether it was a small exhibit or a kid-friendly experiential space.As I haven't seen other shows here it's hard to generalize curator choices: but I would say go with an open mind rather a judgmental one (though you would want to check the website for what's on), knowing that the space is quite small (will NOT compare for instance with the old ICP in NY) and therefore you can fit it into a day with a visit to the Broad and/or the County Museum. There's no admission cost, parking is free or nominal ($1 on weekend), so if there's a good show on you will consider yourself very very lucky.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cicada88
50,Great lecture series,Tough to get tickets. Set your alarm and log in a few minutes before and be prepared to click the second reservations open up for the most popular lectures. Free tickets. Fascinating lecturers.Head across to Hinoki and the Bird for cocktails or a late dinner afterwards.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Culinary-widow
50,Excellent Photography Facility,"This relatively new photography gallery is best known for special exhibits. There is no ""permanent"" exhibition. Every few months or so, a new photography exhibit is brought in. All are of excellent quality, highlighting the best and latest by world-renowned photographers. Skylight Studios is a related facility on the grounds, and provides a venue for special events and presentations associated with photography. When visiting, try to catch an exhibit, as well as one of the lectures / presentations.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheBrasilian
50,Special Photo / Digital Museum ....,"Thanks to the Annenbergs for another amazing cultural edifice in LA, and it's Tops! Nestled in Century City, between the towers, this small photo museum packs a major wallop in impact. Never crowded and world class themes. Saw exhibition, Life, & it was spectacular.

Parking is reasonable and there is no entrance fee. Give yourself one hour tops to view the museum. And give yourself another 15 min to enjoy the surprisingly beautiful grounds,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StaceyAN
50,Great Place!,"All photographers must go! We read about this on tripadvisor and planned a day around attending this place- so worth it! The museum is in a huge business complex, so we thought we were in the wrong place but when we got to the museum the collection on ""Best New Photographers"" was tremendous! The collection was small, but we took our time and spend two hours there! There is no permanent collection, so you are able to spend a lot of time with each work that is displayed. I loved that it was contemporary photographic with a strong social documentary focus. And it was free (and not crowded on our weekend day), cannot recommend it enough, a highlight of our trip!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CosmopolitanGirl8184

50,A fantastic and free ! museum,"This ""space"" for photography is actually not a museum. They don't own any of the photos displayed in an often and frequently changing calendar. Some works are expressly done for a particular show and some are already existing works that fit the theme of that particular exhibit. All exhibits are accompanied by outstanding videos which feature the artists and their discussion of their techniques and world view.Highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brooklyngirl43

50,I love the annenberg,This is by far one of my favorite places to go visit. All of their exhibits are outstanding. They feature different themes and photographers. I like how they have a video presentation with the photographers giving their view about why they take their pictures. It is free and I don't know why a lot more people don't take advantage of it.

50,Photography At Its Best,"On my recent birthday, my family joined me in visiting the Annenberg Space for Photography. As always, I was in awe of the photographs on the walls, the video that played on the current theme. I interacted with one of the electronic devices and learned more about one of the photographers and her presentation. Parking is nominal on weekends but you need to make certain you get your ticket stamped and that the payment machine is working correctly; if not,the staff at the museum will fix the problem, which happened once. Our visit was leisurely and we included a visit to the nearby Skylight Studios, which currently has a gravity room.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tapbelle

40,Inspiring place to see great photography,"I made it a point to seek out the Annenberg Space for Photography when visiting L.A. recently after reading rave reviews on this site. I am a hobbyist photographer and art lover in general. It was a difficult place to find but once I got there I found it very inspiring! There is an introductory film that highlights some up-and-coming photographers as well as other photo-related trends and projects. I spent about a half hour viewing the gallery, another half hour watching the film, and an hour or so in the free reading room. In the reading room, I paged through some of the interesting books and resources available to visitors. It was a rejuvenating stop on my sightseeing tour of L.A.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SMLove226
50,A beautiful place where photography is taken seriously,"We visited at opening time on the second day of a new exhibit. At 11 a.m. on a Sunday morning there were only a handful of people there, which surprised us quite a bit. We watched a couple of videos by photographers showing their work and what it means to them. Also studied works displayed in a couple of galleries.By the time we left the crowd had picked up, but it was anything but crowded. Admission is free and they validated parking for us.

50,Great photography exhibit space,"One of the larger photography centric galleries I've visited. The exhibits are thought provoking, with a high caliber of talent and storytelling.

50,Sink or Swim: A World of Concerns,"The Annenberg Space is not really a large gallery space. The issues behind Sink or Swim are massive. Somehow the two come together in such a wonderful was that the story is told visually and verbally in such a seamless manner that you learn a great deal, experience the threat that the water on our planet can present and the work that so many great minds are doing to ameliorate.The experience does not take long to experience. What takes quite a while is trying to figure out if the planet will give us the time to find a way to survive.Thanks Annenberg for presenting this important message through the various media you have used.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tshubert

50,What? Free!! Incredible Exhibits - Total Worth IT!,"These days there are not many places with ""free"" admission. This place is not only a great place to visit but very informative and inspiring. It is nestle in Century City. Depending on one's interest in the exhibit expect to stay about one to two hours. The parking on Saturday and Sunday is $1.00 with validation. They have a 15 to 20 minute video which speaks about the exhibit. I have been to the current exhibit twice. The first time with my teenage son and then with my two teenage nephews.

50,First-rate photography exhibits and learning experience; must see!,"Aside from the awesome photography on display at the Annenberg Space, there is a story to be told by the depth and range of the exhibits. I have been here a few times and I never cease to be amazed by the impact of these exhibits. I think it’s the best combination of art and photojournalism in picture displays.The current exhibit, called “Sink or Swim,” is an absolute must for anyone wanting to see: (1) coastal life perseverance by people in hard-up locales, and (2) how the most creative architects have channeled their energies into making adaptive dwelling units and community spaces. The message has positives and negatives, but the bottom line is that a huge percentage of the Earth’s population lives near the ocean and therefore must coexist with lots of water. The movie, the photos and the commentary are all top quality presentations. Set aside an hour or so to watch the accompanying film (always excellent) and see all the images.Hope these notes help:* The museum is free.* The parking garage is off of Constellation or Olympic. Pull a ticket and bring it to the museum to have it validated. During peak times it’s $3.50 for three hours. After 16:30 and on weekends it’s $1.00 flat fee. That’s a great parking rate for just about anywhere in L.A.* There is a pretty cool reading room adjacent to the main gallery where you can browse photography books and magazines.* The Annenberg Space is surrounded by giant offices, so traffic and parking are a breeze on weekends. During the week = major congestion. I recommend going on a weekend; there’s hardly anyone there.* The adjacent grassy park has quite a few tables and chairs for hanging out and enjoying food/drink from the nearby eateries (which might be closed on weekends, however).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JimL239

The Annenberg itself is spacious, beautifully designed with comfortable seating for the multi-media parts of exhibits, and film presentations.You can also walk to some well known restaurants from here including Top Chef judge Tom Collichio's Craft, and the legendary Century Plaza Hotel is a 5 minute walk away.

I've found every exhibit to be carefully selected and to be an important learning experience.The Annenberg is free, which blows me away. This gives no one an excuse to miss this wonderful place!Don't miss seeing the documentary on the exhibit. It's so fascinating to get the behind the scenes stories regarding the photographs.

40,Top notch and free,"Not being a country music lover, I wasn't expecting too much from a visit to the exhibit on country music photographs. What a pleasant surprise to see wonderful photographs intelligently displayed in a beautiful space, plus a top notch documentary. We get to Los Angeles once a year, and I will definitely return to the Annenberg for other exhibits. And you can't beat the price. We went on a Sunday, and this was a perfect way to spend a couple hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/squillaba
50,A great gift to LA,"So appreciative that the Annenberg Foundation built this fabulous free museum to showcase photography. Every exhibit is astonishing. Do not miss the videos that accompany the exhibits.The setting in this beautiful architectural space is also worth a trip. A short walk from the Westfield mall, no tourist should leave the City without appreciating these wonderful works of photography which are showcased in a very accessible and entertaining way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ValLosAngeles
20,Trite and boring,"All is vanity, unfortunately I didn't care. Lacks any kind of interesting challenge to the art. Mildly amusing and astonishingly sanitized. Why would you want to waste your time........",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cross8868
50,Through the eye of a view finder!,"This is one of my favorites places in all of LA. It is mostly free, FREE, just have to pay a small fee for the parking. If you enjoy photograhpy, looking at it, learning about how a particular shot was taken, or learning some of the back story on the subjects and about the photographers themselves, you don't want to miss visiting the Annenberg. The exhibts have mostly all been tremendously interesting, at least the ones I was lucky enough to have seen. It isn't a huge place. But if you have an hour and a half, it is the perfect size for taking it all in. Check their website for details, hours, address, parking and of course info on the current exhibt. Wish there were more places like the Annenberg around LA. Have fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JulieChambers
50,BRILLIANT and FREE!!!!,"The Annenberg Space for Photography is one of the most wonderful places to open in Los Angeles in years. It celebrates the magnificent art of photography in ways you could never imagine. The space shows 3 to 4 exhibits a year...it just concluded the National Geographic exhibition with incredible photographs through the years - including the Afghani Girl - that iconic cover that we all know. The space runs a short film explaining the exhibit and it is free to the public Wednesdays through Sundays, closed Mondays & Tuesdays. I highly recommend this for locals and visitors alike.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DonAdelle
40,Something a Little Different,This smallish museum is located in a complex of office buildings. Admission is free but validated parking is a modest $3.50. In July 2014 show and films were about country music performers and their photographers..,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SockFour
50,"BEST KEPT SECRET IN LOS ANGELES, AND IT'S FREE!","It all started when I saw signs on light standards on Olympic Boulevard that said, ""Who Shot Rock and Roll?"" After driving by them for about a month, I wondered, ""Who DID shoot Rock and Roll, and what does that mean? So I went home and googled it. OMG! It was the Annenberg Space for Photography, hidden among the tall office buildings in Century City. They offer periodic FREE photographic exhibitions that are beautifully curated with state of the art multimedia presentation as well as evening events. There is usually a very interesting and informative short movie with each exhibit. I've been to three now, Who Shot Rock and Roll, The Power of Photography, National Geographic: 125 years, and the newest one, Country: Portraits of an American Sound.. Each time, I have taken family and friends with me, and no one has ever been disappointed. My suggestion: Go early, allow a couple of leisurely hours there, and then shop and have lunch in Century City. Tom Colicchio's Craft is practically next door...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kathiek611
50,"Great building, interesting layout-Enjoyed!",The exhibit of Folk & Western artists was well done and the video with Kenny Rogers was excellent and just the right length. It was fun to pick out old favorites and hear them on the jukebox. Parking was just $! on the weekend and very convenient. The mall is close by with the well stocked food court.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/19022013
50,Unexpected place to find art,This little space is in the middle of Century City - hidden amongst the office building. I saw an amazing Helmut Newton Exhibit here that was very comprehensive. I look forward to returning when they have something else relevant. I believe that they are currently showing an exhibition on country music that did not appeal to me.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelingworkingmom
50,If you love photography...,Then go here. I have seen excellent shows here. Well worth the time. The parking is right down below and though you pay it's very easy to deal with.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janew79

On the weekend there are No traffic hassles, but get directions on parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suz91101
30,Take away the hyperbole,"If you read the reviews here, you'd think this would blow your mind away. Its fine, some interesting video presentations on photography, but its just a bit limited, and if you read what's here, I think you could end up with too high expectations. Fine way to spend an hour if you've time free in Century City though",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Waldea
50,Great exhibits,"Annenberg is one of these little gems that we have here in Los Angeles, tucked away in Century City.Check for the most recent exhibit, I think they change about every 3 months.Fantastic way to spend the day, and afterward we walked over to Westfield Shopping center for lunch and coffee.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shanas758

50,Amazing experience,"We visited the exhibit, ""The Power of Photography: National Geographic 125 years"" - and it was a truly eye-popping display.

50,Best Free Thing In Los Angeles,This is a fabulous gallery with rotating exhibits. We've seen three different exhibits over the past 18 months and have enjoyed all of them. Most of the exhibits take about two hours to experience everything. There is usually a short movie that goes along with the exhibit.Tip: Don't wait for the final weekend of an exhibit or you will have to wait for quite a while to enter.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BThomas2218
50,If you love Photography you must go,I collect photography and am in love with this beautiful space. It'd not an all day museum visit - more like one hour of the greatest stimulus! Go!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sanukphoto

Parking with validation, under the building is $3.50 during the week and $1.00 on weekends.The venue is set up to be viewer friendly. Kids and adults will enjoy the exhibits.

50,Good Venue for Art and Photography,"Last Sunday, I visited the Annenberg Space for Photography and caught the last day of the National Geographic photography exhibition. Fantastic display of photography from around the world. Extremely well organized and beautifully displayed. Absolutely amazing photography !!! The exhibition became crowded, however, after a short time, due to the relatively small area of the exhibition. I have heard that it is much less crowded during the weekdays. There was no charge to see the exhibition and parking was only $1 ! I will definitely look for more exhibits at this venue.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alanmhersh
50,Definitely worth a visit,"We were able to enjoy the National Geographic photo exhibit during our stay in L.A. The building and grounds are beautiful, parking was easy and the exhibit was really just the right size. I wish we hadn't had to endure the large and noisy school group that was there that day but it was still a wonderful trip and I look forward to seeing another offering in the future.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JenK992
50,Definitely Worth the Trip. Easy Parking (sort of...),"I heard the National Geographic exhibition was terrific. I decided to head there today because tomorrow is the end of the exhibit. The physical gallery is small...but the display was beautifully executed. I've heard about other fine exhibits they've had. I would return. This exhibit showed so many fine photos on well lit high definition televisions.Because it was the last weekend for this publicized show, it was crowded. I suggest going to a show earlier in the cycle. I waited 25 minutes to get in....and it was cozy in the galleries.Parking is easy and accessed off of Constellation Blvd between Ave of the Stars and Century Park East. It took a while to get in as security was checking everyone's trunks. I was also told that someone who had their dogs in the car was told to leave. Lucky me today because I didn't have my dog with me. Don't bring your pets. They aren't allowed in the parking structure. Make sure to get your ticket validated at the gallery. On the weekend parking is only $1.00. It was very confusing when I was leaving because I couldn't find a pay station as they have in malls. (I was told to pay at the pay station.) The machines at the exits take credit cards.There is no entrance fee to the photo gallery.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OBD2142
50,National Geographic,Seeing the amazing display of 500 photos was overwhelming. The fresh way of displaying these photos made the experience so much more enjoyable. It is wonderful that the museum is free and even validates parking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/280melissab
50,Exhibits always worth the effort,"We have been to many exhibits here, but the 125 Years of National Geographic is our favorite so far. They have managed to fit thousands of images into the tiny gallery by using monitors, film, and interactive touch screens. If possible, try to visit during the week when it is not as crowded. One of the very few free gallery/museums in the city, they even validate your parking down to $1. Only through April 27, 2014, so see it if you can!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mah_Murrini
50,Favorite art destination in LA,"I've been here twice now for different exhibits, and both times were amazing. See the national geographic photography 125 year anniversary exhibit before it's too late!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R3ctivision
50,Priceless experience that only cost $1,"This is a wonderful place for everyone from professional photographers to people who just like to look at pretty pictures. The staff was very friendly, the building and surrounding areas are beautiful, it's FREE to get in and validated parking is only $1 in the garage!! You couldn't ask for a better weekend activity.I recently attended the exhibit celebrating the 125th anniversary of National Geographic and thought it was amazing (runs through April 27th). They've displayed so many iconic pictures on walls and LED screens, as well as included some short films and interviews with the magazine's photographers. I'm looking forward to visiting again and seeing other special exhibits here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MayaD888
50,Wonderful!,"Went to see the ""125 Years of National Geographic"" exhibit ... Stunning! The layout and interactive displays were great, and the location of the museum is perfect.

50,national geography exhibit is a must see,Loved this incredible exhibit of photographs spanning so many themes with unparalleled imagery. The documentary movie is exceptionally informative and the exhibit is presented in such a riveting and unique way.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/looshi
50,Just Do It! Visit this wonderful place,"Whether you are a photography enthusiast and hobbyist like me or an indulgent partner of one like my SO, do plan a trip to the Annenberg Space for Photography. First it's free, and the parking in the underground garage is only $1 (with ASP validation) on weekends. More important, it is a place focused entirely on the essence of communicating through photographs -- and they do it very, very well.Do NOT miss the current exhibit -- through April 2014 -- celebrating the power of National Geographic photography over its 125 years of publication. Rather than a static display of a few dozen matted and framed prints, this glorious multi-media experience features more than 500 top-notch images by the very best professionals on several multi-panel flat screens programmed to change just about the time you have absorbed each one of the 2-4 on that display. You can cruise through, or -- much more likely -- you will stand mesmerized in front of one panel, soaking in each beautiful or disturbing or funny or moving image until you realize its cycle has begun to repeat.Just when you think you have had enough standing, you can choose to watch a video featuring six of the photographers, their images and what drives them to travel the world to capture them. A second, shorter video shows how and why ASP and National Geographic created the exhibit as a multi-media experience.This was my first visit, so I can't vouch for past or future exhibits. But I plan to come back, and probably many times!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oscar505
50,Magnificent National Geographic Exhibit,"First of all, the Annenberg Space for Photography is a great venue and easy to get to. Abundant free parking and easy navigation from parking to the exhibit.No admission fee, donations welcome!Upon stepping into the darkened exhibit room, it all seemed overwhelming at first, but the magazine covers drew us in until something just grabbed each one of us in some emotional way. They mix video with hardcover photos and the experience is worth every minute of your time. You can't help but walk away in some state of change.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/goadventures

50,Fantastic photos,"The Annenberg Space for photography is an intimate state-of-the-art setting that showcases photography. The current exhibit is on National Geographic and its photos on war, animals, people, nature, etc. The National Geographic exhibit is the best exhibit that has shown at Annenberg to date. There are 30+ LED monitors, photographic essays, and videos. It takes about an hour to go through the exhibits and watch the video. Entry is free. Garage parking is $1 (after 4:30PM on Wed-Fri, all day Sat-Sun) or $3.50 (before 4:30PM on Wed-Fri).

40,Helmut Newton Exhibition July 2013,"Saw some of Helmut Newton's most famous, iconic high fashion photography spanning his illustrious career in this rare exhibition. The loop movie and video clips added depth and historically dimension to the whole show. It gives you an idea of the fashion development and the climate Newton was working with then. Lots of stilettoes, fierce make-up, gelled- big hair, big shoulder pads and very tall statuesque models.The Annenberg Space of Photography does great work to showcase quality work.The drive into Century City can be daunting with all that traffic though. The view is stark, clean line, highrise office building with lots of open spaces in the courtyard. Bring a warm wrap. It gets rather chiilly when the wind kicks up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/3Kells
50,Spectacular photos in a stunning setting,The photographs currently exhibited in the space are exceptional. They also have documentaries you can sit and watch which are well worth the time. This exhibit can be visited more then once (it's free) so you can appreciate everything it has to offer.There is a wonderful gift shop down the hill from the Annenberg called skylight Studios. It has above average items as well as a book signed by Steve McCurry.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travchef
30,the Annenberg,"Interesting location and set up. Unfortunately the day I went there was a nude display and not appropriate for children. However, the location was very engaging for those who enjoy photography. The artists vary and so does the theme. Parking is underground and distant.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelingranmaFresno
50,Awesome exhibit,The Annenberg Space for Photography is a must visit for all people interested in photography. It hosts different exhibitions and is small enough to not be overwhelming. The displayed pictures are supported by videos (in the case of the current exhibit - a biography of the artist and snippets of shots his wife made giving a glance into his private persona).,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Xabbu
30,Unusual,"The Annenberg has a very difficult space for hanging photographic exhibitions, and the parking is difficult for first timers. They do some interesting exhibitions, and some of the documentaries they make in conjunction with the exhibitions are excellent, such as the one they did on war photographers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fotodaze
30,Interesting Photography,"This is in a small building in Century City. It is hidden behind an office building, so we had some trouble locating it. There is no close parking. I would not make it a destination, but it is worth a visit if you are in Century City to visit the mall or have an hour to spare while doing something in the area. The collection was interesting and well laid out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MargieLA
50,"Brilliant, and free to the public","This one of those hidden gems that you won't believe when you get there. Stellar photography exhibits that rotate about every three months. Presented in a way that only the Annenberg Foundation can. And unbelievably, free to the public. Most people don't go to Century City for leisure, but this is definitely worth the trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/131Joanne131

50,Spectacular Views Inside and Out,What a wonderful treat! The exhibit was really inspiring and dramatic. No expense was spared in the presentation of these photographs. The view of the Century City Buildings standing on the steps of the Annenberg is really breathtaking.

The location is so lovely, overlooking a surprise mini park in the midst of all the concrete and glass",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janieB1123
30,space not suited for photography,"it was a movie theatre space converted to a photography space....the largest room here is devoted to showing videos, hosting speaking engagements and music concerts...the 'photography' exhibition space is relegated to hallways where one must stand just a few feet away from the images...lighting is sub-par...photographs are even displayed near the bathrooms...parking in the structures and finding your way around the complex can be a nightmare...they could have found so many better buildings to house a photography space, which would allow better accommodations and mostly importantly - better viewing!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheOriginalSamiam
50,Great for Photo Buffs,This viewing space has photo shows that change every few months. Some are good others great. The location is a small stand alone building in Century City right between all the tall office buildings. No charge for admission and discounted parking. Plenty of places for coffe and lunch in walking distance. Takes less than 3 hours so plenty of meal time left. Very nice experience and free!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlanB911

No matter what the exhibit subject matter is, the quality of the photography, the multi-media presentations, the curation of the shows is top notch down to every well thought out detail.This is a place I will always return to time after time for each new exhibition. Their stunning multi-media video presentations always have the same effect on me. Jaw dropping awe. At times I have watched the video presentation for some shows a second time to just let it soak in.Just when you think it can't better - it does ... Admission is free!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B0hdana
50,Bite-sized exhibitions!,"All too often a visit to a large gallery or museum becomes tedious, as the scale and amount of art on display is simply overwhelming. Add on miles of trudging around and generally poor and expensive food, drink, and parking as well as high entrance fees and it can be a mixed experience.Hats off then to this great little facility which resolves all of these issues. With validated parking costing $3.50 max (and only $1.00 at weekends), several good value cafes and restaurants adjacent to the gallery, and the exhibitions focussed and concise, this hits all the spots!We went to see the spectacular ""No Strangers"" exhibit, a stunningly vibrant look at cultures around the world, which, despite all unforgettable appearances to the contrary, simply highlight how similar we all are worldwide. The photos were superbly printed, and the accompanying video informative and entertaining. The free audio guides are another welcome plus. In all, in a city full of things to see and do, this should be up there as a must see. Oh, and did I mention it's free?! I'll certainly be back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/526CharlesM
50,Who Shot Rock and Roll,Unreal exhibit - Who Shot Rock and Roll! This is the only place on the West Coast that will be hosting this exhibit. 50 plus years of Rock and Roll photography.

You are soaring in their universe and it's awesome.If you go on a weekend the parking is under 2.00--the museum is free--head phones and all.The space outside the center is a mesmerizing view of the city.....wow-- thank you,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoyS400
40,Great exhibition space and exhibits,"We went this past weekend for the ""Who Shot Rock & Roll"" exhibit. We had been to Annenberg before, and love the small setting. The space does not leave you wondering for hours like a huge museum.The Rock & Roll exhibit is great, and I highly recommend it. You should plan for an hour to an hour and a half for the entire process. You can pace yourself through the exhibits and then take time out to watch the video. Be sure to have your QR reader ready on your phone to listen to the actual photographers discuss their shots.Finding the place can be a little hard, but follow the small signs for parking and follow everyone else to the exhibit. On the weekends you should allow at least 30 minutes to wait in line, but thankfully Century City is deserted at that time so you won't have traffic.You will find yourself looking to come back for their next exhibit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lfcox
50,Who Shot Rock-N-Roll?,GREAT exhibit! Tons of wonderful photography and anecdotes of that specific moment in time. Please note: Allow plenty of time on weekends for the queue outside and for the 35 min documentary & slide show inside. The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful too!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LilHonu
50,Music fans and photography fans - it's a hit!,"Along many of the lampposts down major streets in Los Angeles are banners advertising an exhibit entitled ""Who Shot Rock and Roll"" showing at the Annenberg Space for Photography. Now through October 7, the exhibit is about the men and women who photographed iconic figures in music.I didn't even know L.A. had an Annenberg Space for Photography. We'll, the ASP has been around since 2009 and is located in the heart of Century City. We went on Labor Day and the streets were pretty empty. We parked underneath the building. Be sure to get your parking ticket validated so that you get a nice discount on the parking. We were there about 1 1/2 hours and it cost $1.00.Once at the exhibit, they had a table of fruit, cookies and lemonade for free. Not sure if it is always there (I doubt it), but it was nice to grab a little snack.Admission is also free and that is always the case.Inside there are walls filled with terrific photographs of various music artists from the 50's and 60's like Elvis, the Beatles, Hendrix and the Stones, up to more contemporary artists like the Ramones, Amy Winehouse and Madonna. Bring your cell phone and be sure you have a QR reader. There are a bunch of those QR code thingies all over the exhibit and you can pick up additional commentary by the photographers themselves by using your phone. Pretty cool.There's also a 25 minute film that is worth sitting through which describes not only the world of the musicians, but how the photographers are brought into that world. Some of the photos you will recognize as the basis for various album covers, others show the musicians in private, never before seen moments.Well worth the 1 1/2 hours. You could go through the exhibit faster, but why hurry. Enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jtlerman
50,Fantastic! A MUST for Photography Lovers.,"We come for every show and never are disappointed. The video presentation is interesting, informative and typically 30-40 minutes. Afterwards, you walk the hall and see everything that was in the video. You need about 90 minutes to enjoy this small, but impactful, museum. Century City Mall is across the way, or walk over to the hotel for a drink and people-watching. A short drive two blocks is Rodeo Drive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/whocareswhoiam
50,"Remember, this is Rock and Roll( and punk, R&B, country and others) from a PHOTOGRAPHY point of view. Highly recommended.","This musical Rock and Roll history museum/exhibit was a joy to visit. It was free which was great. The first thing to hit me was the various forms of music formats from reel to reel to CD/DVD. Depending on your age, one will recognize some or all..lol.There are so many iconic photographs that will have one saying, “oh yeah, I remember that"" and the exhibit spans early 1940s to 2012. There is a video(about 40 minutes) and it is fascinating. All music genres are presented from the photographers' POV and the people/celebrities are in it. You will be glued to it from beginning to end.There is paid parking in one of the worst- congested parts of L.A. county. Take public transit.Outstanding and refreshing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/areacode323

50,My Discovery For the Day: Maggie Taylor,"As a photography hobbyist, I couldn't pass up the opportunity to visit this gallery on a recent Saturday afternoon. (Admission: free) Their ""Digital Darkroom"" exhibit was amazing, especially because it introduced me to the work of Maggie Taylor, who does something called ""fabricated photography."" She takes old photos and scans them into a computer to come up with dream-like images that are more like paintings than photography. Gorgeous! I especially liked her ""Girl With A Bee Dress."" Great gallery with a smiling, friendly staff. I'll definitely be visiting again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/492HappyTraveler
