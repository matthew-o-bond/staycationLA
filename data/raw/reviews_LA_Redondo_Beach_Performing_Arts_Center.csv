50,Great Performing Arts Center,"The Redondo Beach Performing Arts Center, actually located in Manhattan Beach is wonderful. The various shows they put on are all great. The seats are pretty comfortable and parking is free. The pricing of the their shows is very reasonable and you will have a great time. Everyone that works there is kind and they really will help you find your seats. The theater is not huge so there is not a bad seat in the house.We have been there many times, and they are kid friendly. Our last adventure was to see the Redondo Beach Ballet Company put in the Snow Queen. It was magical. We have not seen a bad play, musical or ballet there.They have tons of parking and there are wonderful places to dine near by. They also have a park right next to the parking lot, if you get there early and want your kid to blow off energy before the show. You will really like this place. We will be back again and again.",elizabethlascheid
40,Adventurebuddies42 goes to the Redondo Beach Performing Arts Center,"We have seen many shows here but recently the Christmas Journey. It is clean, nice, restrooms, seats are comfortable enough, very spacious. There are many great shows offered here.",The Adventure Buddies
50,This venue is a great place to see musicals.,Manhattan Beach has a wonderful Preforming Arts place where very good performances that cater to may sorts of things that are good for young and older people. It also provides tickets through Gold Star discounts which increase how many people attend. So if you want to reduce the cost you can go to Gold star. We have been to this venue may times. I I highly recommend it.,Caroline A
50,Many fun experiences all year round.,I have been to speakers nights here that are so excellent with prominent speakers. I have been to musical andballets. I am looking forward to the upcoming performance of the LA Ballet company in December. If you are visiting check on line for a show or a speakers night.,Judy201564
50,Great small venue,Attended a concert there and sound was good from the upper section we were sitting in. Venue is small enough that there are no bad seats that we could identify. Restrooms (at least the ladies room) had a good number of stalls to accommodate the crowd size. Free parking is a real bonus. And easy entrance and exit.,janad63
40,Not a bad seat - good parking,"This was my first time attending this venue and I was really pleased. We had great seats but there really isn’t a bad seat in the house. You could purchase he cheapest seats and still have a great view of the stage. Also, parking is quite easy and plentiful.If you’re seeing productions by Encore Production Company, just know they’re more of a community theatre company than semi-pro.",FunintheOCsun
50,Best venue in the City,"I’ve seen everything from a National Yo-yo Competition to a full blown production of Dreamgirls. The acoustics are great, easy parking and close to Hermosa, Manhattan and Redondo Beach. I recommend this theater for any of your interests. Even some you didn’t know you had.",BorgHouse
30,"Decent venue, Awesome performance","We were at this venue to see the Hot Chocolate Nutcracker. First, let me begin by saying that everyone (including infants) must pay for a seat. Therefore, I bought a much cheaper ticket off of Goldstar just for one infant to sit in any seat. However, since we were a party that wanted to sit together, we were not able to buy from Goldstar. They only seat in groups of 4 and, you are not guaranteed to be sitting near each other for multiple groups. Nonetheless, we got our tickets about a week after they went on sale for the 7:00pm show and the good seats were just beginning to disappear.SeatsWe purchased front row terrace for the kids and second row for the adults (AA/BB 49-54). I suggest front row terrace if you have kids since the orchestra seats only have 1 column to exit on each side. Therefore, if you want to sit towards the middle, you have to step across multiple people just to leave to go to the bathroom. This is a small theater so majority of the seats give a good view but, you never know if big hair or tall hat will get the seat in front of you.Parking:We got there about 45 minutes before the performance started and there was plenty of parking left.Performance:It was not clear which line to wait in to get to your seat but, luckily the two lines were short. Once the doors opened they tried to quickly seat everyone for the performance but sitting in the terrace section you had to watch a few people pass by trying to find their seat even though the performance had already started. The line for the bathroom during intermission was crazy so I suggest getting there early enough for everyone to use the bathroom before the performance starts.Overall everyone had a good time and enjoyed the show.",Exquize
10,"Nice venue, RUDE and unorganized staff","Attended an amazing performance last night. However, the evening was overshadowed by the unorganized, unprofessional rudeness of the staff. Having never been to this venue before, we consulted with an usher at the entrance for directions to our seats and he pointed us to where our seats were located and directed us to walk in that direction. A few feet into the auditorium another usher said ""let me see your tickets"" and grabbed them abruptly and said ""your seats are on the other side you need to enter from that side"". My wife and I walked out and tried to find out how to get to the other side. We consulted another usher and she said there isn't another way around and told us to go the way we were going and asked us who directed us to go another way. It's a small auditorium and well before the performance was to start and people were walking around the auditorium everywhere. Finally, we simply ignored the other ushers and walked the 50 feet across the auditorium to get to our seats in the 3rd row of the orchestra seating area.2nd, they serve drinks before the performance and no announcement is made about when people should head for there seats. Was not an issue for us, but seemed an appropriate thing to do.3rd, No announcement was made at the beginning of the performance prior to the artist coming out about taking photos. Again, not an issue for us other than being interrupted several times by the staff walking in front of us during the performance to tell other attendees to stop taking photos. In fact during the first song, a staff member was having a long discussion with someone directly behind us and we could barely hear the performer. Even after the intermission, the staff were interrupting our view of the performance by walking in front of us and stopping people from taking photos. At every other venue we have attended, those announcements are made at the beginning of the performance which they failed to do. It is annoying when people take photos and I agree with that policy, BUT tell people about it prior to the performance.We traveled from Ohio to see this performance and were extremely disappointed and disgusted with the unorganized procedures or lack there of instructions at this venue. It's a nice small venue with an intimate seating arrangement. They really need to work on their professionalism.",Dale B

50,"""A Christmas Journey"" Program - December 2016","This annual Christmas musical presentation is put on by Journey of Faith Church. It is probably one of the very BEST Christmas Holiday programs in the Southern California area. The show features actors, dancers, singers and musicians representing a wide variety of musical styles. Professionally written, scripted and choreographed, this event is both thoroughly entertaining and inspirational, and best of all, admission is FREE.",Jonaleen A
50,Excellent Moderate-size Theater,"We've attended numerous theatrical performances over the years at this theater, which has been substantially upgraded over the years from the high school theater it once was. The moderate size means that the seats are all reasonably close to the stage, and even when full it doesn't feel particularly crowded. Technically it has all the capabilities of a full-up theater (stage size, lights, sound, orchestra pit, etc) so can support large productions. The lavatories are also big enough that you don't have to worry during an intermission that you might be late for the second part of a show. There is ample free parking within reasonable walking distance.",00Bruce00
40,Very good venue,"I have seen many performances at the Redondo Beach Performing Arts Center, most recently Hello, Dolly which was fantastic. It's not difficult to get great seats and there is a large parking lot. The snacks and drinks offered are okay but not great.",Stashu25
50,Jersey Boys Meets Mamma Mia,"The two tribute groups perform a great show (and you know the words!) that is a real treat! The evening started with ABBA Fab until intermission and then the December 13th (Jersey Boys tribute) group hit the stage. Before they were finished, the ABBA group returned and the two groups took turns doing several more well known songs.Many were on their feet and some were dancing in the aisles.The seats are all good with the priceier seats toward the front and the 1st-come-1st serve General Admission seats at the rear 3rd of the auditorium.The show is rated for all audiences and was well worth the price.Nothing like a truly enjoyable evening of music and the opportunity to sing along.Enjoy!!! (We certainly did!)",Steve H
40,Nice Venue,I attended my nieces dance competition here today. Easy to find with convenient & sufficient parking. Very nice facility that is well maintained. Very nice size theater & really appreciated that the rows were decently spaced which makes it easier to get by someone & gives you some leg room. Stage visible from all seats. Would like to visit again for a stage play or concert.,CharlaAV711
40,A lot like Old Broadway,"This place is real! Acoustics are good. Seating is good. Productions tend to be exceptional, certainly compared to what's going on in the vicinity. Perfect location to grab some culture without having to drive downtown.",Primo54
40,"Easy, free parking","Six of us tried this venue to see a production of ""Damn Yankees"". We were impressed. There really aren't any bad seats. There is a large lobby and very large parking lot right in front of the venue. The sound and lighting were good. All in all a comfortable place to see a show.",MaryLouise H
50,Excellent venue,"Been here many times, usually for some musicals but also for other productions. It's a very nice theater and good seating.",UltimateWines
40,Good local theatre,"As a South Bay resident for over thirty years, I’m somewhat ashamed to admit I’ve been driving past the Performing Arts Center for years now with only a mild sense of curiosity. Mind you, I love live theatre, and am quick to book tickets at the Pantages or the Music Center, but for whatever reason I just never think of checking out the local theatre scene.And then Goldstar sent us a promo for Ragtime, a musical I’ve been wanting to see for years.What a pleasure it is driving less than ten minutes to a venue, then finding plenty of free parking. We arrived about 30 minutes before showtime and the line at the Will-Call window was already about eight or nine people deep. Predictably, the line moved quickly and we had our tickets in no time flat.After recent theatre experiences at elegant or fashionable locations such as the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion or Orange County’s Center for the Performing Arts, I have to say that our local center seems a bit plain wrap—both in the lobby and within the auditorium itself. Staff was certainly nice enough, albeit a bit underprepared and we waited close to ten minutes at an unmanned station for borrowing hearing devices. Though the floors are unattractive concrete, I loved the uber-wide aisles between rows which allowed passers-by plenty of access to seating without treading on anyone’s toes (or falling into alien laps, which I once nearly did.)The auditorium itself boasts more than 1450 seats. We were just slightly forward of mid-theatre and sound quality was very good, and with my less-than-optimal hearing I appreciated the help of the hearing device which upped the volume of dialogue to the perfect degree for my needs. Seating was comfortable, though visibility was impaired due to inadequate staggering to the point at which gentleman in the row before me spent the whole of Act I doing his impression of a metronome trying to view the action. (He didn’t return for Act II, which gave me a clear field for the rest of the show--and no, I didn’t pay anyone to drag him off.)As for the play itself, I was pleasantly surprised. Although lacking the wonderful richness of Brian Stokes Mitchell’s voice and bit of scenery chewing on the part of one of the supporting actors, it was an engrossing and well-presented production with some fine singing, good acting, effective scenery and really lovely costumes. A thumbs up to 3-D Theatricals for presenting such an enjoyable night of theatre.",Gail G
