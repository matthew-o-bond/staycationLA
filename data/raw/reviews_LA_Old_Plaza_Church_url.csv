50,Spanish Architecture,"After our short walk across Alameda St. from Union Station, we always stop and admire this beautiful church as we pass by. It's situated just a few steps from the entrance to Olvera Street in El Pueblo de Los Angeles. We were surprised that is isn't a Catholic Church but is Methodist. The Spanish style architecture is really stunning, and the church is well-maintained.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/socaltravelers2016
40,Beautiful Methodist church,"This is a beautiful church on the corner of the plaza and Olvera street. With the historic Catholic Church across the street, I was surprised to see this. I was even more surprised to discover that it was a Methodist church since its inception despite its location in the historic Mexican center of city. We met a very nice lady at the front of the church who told us of the church's history. While the exterior hints a Latin architecture, the interior is very Methodist including a beautiful stain glass at the entrance which is accentuated by a mirror when you enter. Take time to visit this one and it will show that true history is way more complex than we ever give it credit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GroverR
50,Being Catholic is part of my Mexican culture..so I,"make it a point to visit every Catholic church I encounter in my travels! Before I browse inside any Catholic church, I will recite a few prayers and thank the Lord for taking care of me. I did not go in this little Church on Olvera Street in old LA, but I did stop in the patio where they were selling food and religious objects like rosaries, saints, and the like. I bought a small rosary and a bracelet as I know I am supporting my religion with my purchase. The food looked good but I was not hungry at this time. The church still looks the same as it did centuries ago with the original architecture..Worth anyone's time",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/840martae
