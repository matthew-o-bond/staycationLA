50,Perfect intimate setting for a show,"We saw the Lea Salonga concert here last night. This is a small venue on the CSUN campus that seats roughly 1,300 people. It is quite a ways from dtla so plan your travel time accordingly. When we arrived there were two parking options: $15 for valet; free parking in Lot B1, which is a five-minute walk away. My wife was in heels so I dropped her off in front and made the long lonely walk myself from the free lot.The space itself is perfect for intimate concerts. The sightlines are great. The acoustics are magnificent (thought it helped that Lea Salonga's vocals are perfect). High ceilings, modern bathrooms, comfortable seats, etc. I will add a note about the staff - they were courteous and professional as a group. Because I had to park a ways, I ended up being late for the start of the performance and had to wait to be seated. However, the staff was kind enough to let me into the space and stand in the back so I could still view the performance while I waited for a break in the show to be seated.Overall, the venue enhanced, and not detracted, from the performance. Worth the drive to Northridge.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chumleyjones
50,Beautiful costumes nice theater,Younes and Soraya Nazarian Center for the Performing Arts is a nice place to see a show. I saw Wynona here years ago and Shen Yun tonight. Even in the nosebleeds you have a great view,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/socalguy7979
30,Maybe I was at a different theatre...?,"Two years ago, we had occasion to attend a performance of Martha Graham’s Dance Company at the Valley Performing Arts Center (or VPAC, as they were then billing themselves. The theatre is now known as The Soraya). While the theatre looks nice and new, bright and shiny, I left feeling it wasn’t my favorite venue—or perhaps it was simply my seats weren’t in the right location that night. So, on our second visit (May, 2017. Admittedly, I'm quite delinquent insofar as posting a review goes.) I made sure to get seats which WERE in the right location—or anyway, so I’d thought: smack-dab in the center of Row G, Orchestra. And I had trouble seeing. OK, to be fair, I’m no giant. I’m actually just an inch below what’s considered average height. But in my many years of theatre-going, I don’t usually have trouble seeing unless I’m seated behind a Pro Basketball Player or someone with a wild mane of hair. Our last visit, the guy sitting in front of me wasn’t terribly tall-- yet I was missing out on a lot of action on the right side of the stage. Not good when it’s a dance performance.The theatre itself is an attractive addition to CSUN’s campus and to Northridge in general with its glass sides and bright interior. Since the usher made a point of telling us to enter Door 1, I’m thinking that it might be a good idea to actually label the doors as such (or if they are labeled, perhaps more prominent labeling is in order). The auditorium itself, I thought, was very pretty—with the wood trim around the sides of the room having sort of a basket weave effect. The floor plan is interesting with seats at four different levels. Parking is easy, and though it's a bit of a walk from the theatre, shuttle service is available for those requiring assistance.Both times we’ve attended VPAC have been dance recitals, so I’ve had no opportunity to test out acoustics—however, with the vision issues, I’m not too terribly enthusiastic about there being a next time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gailg306
50,now called Soraya,"The center has changed its name to Soraya and is located on south side of the campus of California State University at Northridge (CSUN). There is parking available just west of the center in lot B1. Apparently, the parking fee is included in the price of your event ticket. It is a fine facility. The bad news is that signage is not very good inside the theater. The good news is that there are numerous ushers throughout the facility who are eager to assist you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ransom007
50,Great concert and performance venue.,Very good sight lines and acoustics. Have been there numerous times and have seen great shows. Only downfall is when audience members have their cellphone screens lit up and/or are taking photos. Very distracting and rude!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anyonebutme
50,Great Acoustics,"I have visited this theater many times since it's opening. Most recent was in May to see Man of LA Mancha. Even though I had to sit mid nose bleed section, the view of the stage was great. No problem hearing the dialogue or music. Looking forward to returning.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/997tanyan
50,Great performances,"Easy access and free parking make this a very welcome place to visit. It's not cheap, but the performers are world class,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Banerman
50,Excellent Symphonic Experience!,"This native of the San Fernando Valley is a bit embarrassed to confess that this was my first visit to the Valley Performing Arts Center. Waiting until just a few days before the concert given by the Colburn Orchestra, balcony seats were the only option. So my expectations weren't high. And being a professional singer, I am a critical listener. The Colburn Orchestra gave me an excellent symphonic experience with their mastery of the music, reminding me that there is nothing, nothing like live music. But I wouldn't have enjoyed my experience as much had it not been for the acoustics built into this gem in the San Fernando Valley. Bravo!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Towanda4Snix
50,Culture in the Valley right in the back yard!,"This venue has great acoustics, and some great events happening. In the last month I have been here 3 times: to see Manhattan Transfer/Take 6, the Maria Schneider Orchestra, and most recently The Nile Project. The building design is reminiscent of the Dorothy Chandler Pavillion downtown, and that's no accident as this is associated with the Music Center complex. A lovely walk through the historic orange grove at CSUN with a duck pond along the route gets you to the VPAC. There is a little teeny cafe upstairs, coat check downstairs and lots of local restaurants less than 5 minutes away in Northridge to eat before a show, mostly casual dining and family dining or fast food.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AussieAmy2014
50,Sensation place!,"The shows featured here are outstanding! Pricing is reasonable, the location is convenient, and the venue itself provides the perfect performance arena.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelRobs
50,Excellent venue.,"Attended a Jewel concert. The Center is a beautiful design both inside and outside. It is beautiful building. The inside is also really well designed and the theater seating is very comfortable. They had numerous outlets inside that served food and beverages, including alcohol. There was also an outside bistro that was near the roof with a good view of the valley. The sound for the concert was excellent. Very crisp and clear. The entire staff was helpful and friendly!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/berniek1949
50,World Class Performance Venue in my Backyard,"If you want to experience music, dance or plays in a no hassle environment, this is your place. From parking to concessions, no hassles. I've been a season subscriber for five years.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/billybooper
50,A Night at CSUNs VPAC,"My daughter and I thoroughly enjoyed our evening at the Valley Performing Arts Center. The musical, Dreamgirls was incredible and the theatre was well designed, beautiful with great acoustics and sight lines. We look forward to our next visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/54jh2013
50,Absolutely Fantastic People,"I'm a musician and I just worked at the Valley Arts Center last weekend. I've been a professional musician for over 30 years and the people working backstage were possibly the nicest and most helpful I've ever encountered. Of course I can't remember their names but they really were fantastic, above and beyond the call. I know this review almost certainly won't make any difference to anyone considering attending a show here but I just had to say something publicly about the wonderful people that work there",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X8877PNmikek
50,A Hidden Gem in the Valley,"Los Angeles and environs has many performing arts centers and venues but this was my first visit to VPAC. What a pleasant surprise to find an architecturally stunning venue. Readily accessible off the 405 freeway, parking was a breeze and only $6.00. A short walk to the great hall where an outdoor bar was serving drinks - a must in the heat. Inside another bar/bistro served light snacks. While the presentation of these eats was less than sophisticated the food itself was tasty. Staff were courteous and the seats in the loge provided an excellent view of the performance. Highly recommend folks check out the calendar of events and enjoy this gem.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/361madgec
40,"beautiful venue, striking architecture","11.7.2014 - The Toure-Raichel Collective concert.This was our third visit to this beautiful venue. And we look forward to our visit each time.In off-peak traffic it takes about a little over 35 mins. drive from Pasadena.Call ahead to procure ""Rush"" discount tickets. But the downside is having to buy the tickets 1 week before the performance with proof of Student ID at 2pm.Otherwise, full-price ticket are available only through Ticket-Masters.This is a ultra-modern building -- very clean lines, very spacious and airy with lots of glass surfaces and natural light. Check out my photos.The Toure-Raichel Collective performance was rather low key. Idan talked too much though -- we would rather hear Vieux or especially Idan sing. Disappointed they didn't use more traditional Mali instruments. There was banter back and forth between Raichel and Vieux about what to play for the next number. They waffled back-and-forth. Audience don't need to hear that. Have a set program so there is continuity and flow of energy fellows!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/3Kells
40,Sit in the Parterre section,"The long awaited Performing Arts Center is here--on the campus of Cal State Northridge. The quality of performers is attractive to those of us who travel from the Valley to downtown venues. There are excellent dance companies, music groups both classical and pop, lectures and plays. The hall is quite stunning from the outside, with multi-story glass walls. The Parterre section has the best sight lines. In Orchestra, the rake is too flat to be able to see around the people sitting in front of you. The ticket prices are reasonable, much less than the Music Center downtown. Parking is easy and affordable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kathleene_12
