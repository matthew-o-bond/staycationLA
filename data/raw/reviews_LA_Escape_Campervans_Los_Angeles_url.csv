10,Stay away - junk vehicles and high price,"Our Maverick van is a 2015 GMC Savana with 110k miles on it. It’s so beaten up inside out that it looks older than any rental vehicle I’ve ever seen. It’s hard to get used to if your own car is made in this century. Fabric seats are dirty - my daughter wouldn’t put her jacket down on the seat. The original entertainment system is gone, replaced by something that looks out of place and doesn’t even work. Acceleration is very soft - couldn’t maintain normal speed if/when there is a slight uphill climb. Getting over Cajon Pass on I-5 north when leaving Los Angeles was painful. If not driving straight at constant speed, you’d hear the kitchen in the back making noise as utensils thrashing around and plates bouncing up and down. The bedding kit provided with extra cost is minimal. There were a comforter, a cushion/mattress cover and 3 pillows; no sheet.With this kind of equipment, the price is high. Cheaper than RVs, yes, but way more expensive than renting a regular car. Our price was roughly $150 a day plus fuel. The economy doesn’t make sense. It is more comfortable and flexible to rent a SUV and stay in hotels/tents. There is no heating or AC in the van when turned off, so inside temperature is the same as outside temperature, hot or cold. BTW this heavy van is not fuel efficient. Going from LA to Las Vegas almost took $100’s worth of gasoline- more expensive than a one way air ticket - and maybe more pollutions.Staff is friendly overall, but I will not rent from them again.",Dr. Y
20,Be aware what you are getting yourself into,"We had high hopes and expectations for this road trip with the campervan but unfortunately this didn’t turn out to be a pleasant experience. We accidentally scraped the roof sleeper and were asked to pay a few thousand $$ upfront before we can move on with our trip. We ended the trip 2 days early as one of our kid is sick, and they still charged us for the full amount even though we returned the vehicle earlier.The people at the office is friendly, however, their policy is not reasonable to say the least.",Zhu Z
