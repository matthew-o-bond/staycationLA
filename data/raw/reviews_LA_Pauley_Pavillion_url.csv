50,USC v. UCLA was a blast!!!,"While visiting campuses with our daughter, we were fortunate enough to take in a basketball game at Pauley Pavilion on the UCLA campus as they took on cross town and PAC 12 rival, USC. A great game!!! Though both teams are in the middle of the conference standings, the basketball was great, a contest decided in overtime where the home team squeaked out a HUGE WIN!!! The venue was outstanding - concessions and bathrooms were accessible and clean. Seating was comfortable and the game was easy to watch, even though we bought seats in an upper section. The UCLA band, dance/cheer team and, most importantly, the student body were awesome, lending their energy to the cause. We came away loving the visit and taking a little love for the Bruins with us!!! No doubt we were fortunate in our timing - a rivalry game is hard to top! If you get the opportunity, this is a great place to take in a big game!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NHJimmy
50,Classic College Basketball Venue,"As a college basketball fan, I was excited to visit Pauley Pavilion to attend a UCLA game. It is a really good environment that was lively even thought they lost the game.If you have time, get to campus a little before the game (parking in the garage right across from the arena (parking lot 7) was very easy) and visit Coach Wooden's office and the UCLA sports Hall of Fame in Alumni hall next door. Worth the visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dctravel
