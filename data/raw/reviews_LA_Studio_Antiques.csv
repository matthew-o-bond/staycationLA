40,TOO MUCH STUFF! Is that a thing?,üëçüèª If you like to pick. Not so much if you want organization. VINYL! Nice people. Near LAX. Good place to kill time waiting for planes.,gimbler
40,Antique Store El Segundo,"We were taking a trip to finally see Randy's Donuts, the giant Donut in El Segundo, so I looked up other things to do around here and found out about Studio Antiques.Honestly, this places floats between a 3 and a 4... it's not huge, and feels more average than awesome... but I decided to give it the benefit of the doubt and go with 4 stars because it is unique in that it feels more like you're a picker. It isn't organized or displayed particularly well, but that kind of makes it fun because you can go through stuff. And the gem is in the back where they've created a pickers section that are rooms built of junk. I didn't find anything too cool... but it was art! So that has to be respected.The prices were good, and I bet they get new things in all the time, so maybe they just didn't have things that interested me as much this time. Unlike many large antique malls that warrent their own trip... I'd say, this isn't worth a trip by itself, but if you're in El Segundo, for sure check it out!",Michael T
