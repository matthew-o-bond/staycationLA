50,"Fine Architecture, Stunning Choir, Caring Ministry","It's a magnificent Gothic revival building in the British cathedral style, a spiritual oasis in a very large and sometimes cold city. If you are looking for a church that does the high Anglican service ""Right"" St. James in the City is is waiting to welcome you. A magnificent mixed voice choir under the direction of James Buonemani offers a full slate of cathedral choral music at Sunday service, Evensong,and the major and great festivals of the church. Christmas and Easter are especially beautiful as St. James rolls out traditional choral anthems, and mass settings that will have you wondering if you haven't been somehow transported to one of the great cathedrals in the United Kingdom.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brodie52
