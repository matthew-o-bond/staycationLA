50,A great hidden(ish) treasure in a small city,"This brewery feels like a home away from home. Its an intimate lil brewery w great beer. It has its year round offerings as well as offerings that are only available for a short while! Its like a treasure trove!I would recommend this to anyone in Alhambra. Even if you don't like beer, try a small pour of tiki on the beach! It is a fruityish easy drinking beer!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adr323
40,Fruity and Light Beers -- Really Nice People,"Micro brewery with a small tasting room. No food. Mostly fruity pale ales or sour beers, all with a Hawaiian flair. Tiki on the Beach, Surf Shack Akala and Spa Water Saison were worth trying. I was not as fond of their darker beers. Friendly, and informed beertenders who know a lot about beer â€“ their beer and other peoples too! Street parking or nearby lots. Worth a visit. You know what is really strange about Ohana? The city council refused to allow any seating in the tasting room. How dumb is that? Hope all you local people vote those bums out of office in November.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RussellJW
50,Great Brewery with amazing Beertender,"My wife and I stopped in on Friday May 25th during our vacation from Seattle. We loved it. The beer was great, and the beertender working at the time was amazing. We enjoyed talking to him about the story of the brewery and the beer scene in LA. I definitely recommend this brewery.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bengF9488HY
40,Tasty beers and overall good experience,Low key place with just the founder serving us. Very kind and knowledgeable about his beers but wasn't exactly a happening or exciting place to be. Would definitely go again but maybe would need to bring more people with me.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seamles
50,Fill the jug,"I stopped by on Xmas eve because it was the only place that was open on Main Street, all the other bars were closed. This is a place you can only sample the beer or get your jug filled with premium beer made in DTLA. Nice people and good beer go hand in hand, thanks for the buzz.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Creeping_Death_LA
