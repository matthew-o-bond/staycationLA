50,Best BBQ I've Ever Had,"On top of being a champion Pit Master, the owner Renea is an incredible host and a phenomenal teacher. I have attended several of her BBQ classes and keep bringing friends and family to each one. Wherever I travel I have to try BBQ, and this is THE BEST BBQ I'VE EVER HAD (honestly, my mouth is watering as I'm writing this thinking about when I can go back and have more). The best part is that she showed me how to make it!And don't be turned away if you're a vegetarian either because I have vegetarian friends who also love coming here because the classes involve several equally delicious sides, and even non-meat options like Veggie Meatballs!Her classes range in time depending on the dish, but there is always entertainment or something to do. Some meat might take an hour or so to smoke, but that time is then used to make the sides. So it's always timed perfectly with some appetizers to get you warmed up and drooling for the main event.Renea does a fantastic job of collaborating with other groups to create amazing events, on top of classes. She's hosted some non-profit events and very romantic date nights.Renea is a very humble owner as well. She loves winning competitions and bettering herself and she knows that the best way to do that is to get helpful feedback and improve from there. In her classes, she really wants to know honest opinions so she can know how to give her guests the best experience possible.I haven't even mentioned yet how beautiful her home is. As soon as you enter the front gate you'll be blown away by the path leading to the house. You might even see some of their horses. The classes are held in the back yard where there are plenty of smokers to learn about as well as a custom-built brick pizza oven.I will continue to attend every class possible and you should too. :)",Riley
