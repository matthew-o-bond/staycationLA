50,Rubel Castle,What a great tour. Great underappreciated experience. Excellent national area. Docents are right on.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GaryDeanV
50,Hidden Gem,"It would be impossible to attempt an accurate description of this place but we were amazed with everything once we walked through the gates. Everywhere you look there is something to enjoy, it's tucked away in a residential neighborhood which was also unexpected. I'm a native Southern Californian and never knew it was there but my friend and I thoroughly loved the place and learning about the owner.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LadyDiButterfli
40,One of a kind,"Really an amazing, one of a kind place to see. It is quite remarkable to see what someone can do with some ingenuity and mostly all donated material of all types. If you were a kid who liked to build forts as a kid, you will appreciate this rare find. Our docent was fantastic, telling stories that only he knows through his friendship with Michael Rubel. Worth a little trip just outside of Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/294jons
40,Eclectic find off the beaten path in the middle of a Glendora neighborhood,"Eclectic find off the beaten path in the middle of a middle class Glendora neighborhood. Who would have ever known something like this existed? Tours are by appointment, so be sure to check at Rubeltours.org before just showing up. It’s definitely worth the $10.00 entry fee but 2 hours (of mostly standing) was about 30 minutes too long. This castle, now operated by the Glendora Historical Society is everything from funky, dirty and full of junk, to some incredible treasures (like the bell tower and other antiques throughout).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JanN216
50,Awesome fing in the heart of Glendora,This is not a traditional castle. It was created by Michael Rubel and has everything from Old gas pumps to train cars! They offer guided tours but not all the time so be sure to check for times and availability. They ask for a $10 tax deductible donation for the tour which lasts about 3 hours. The overall size is not very big but there is so much to see and your guide will have a ton of stories about Michael and how the castle was built. Great way to spend a day with family and so cool to be local!@STAGGSCROSSING,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/staggscrossing
50,Amazing place to see,This man's home now belongs to the Historical Society. The history and the antiques are truly amazing. A must see. Not for young children. Would definitely go back again as there is so much to see and learn about this castle.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HeleneV245
50,Things of the Past!,A terrific and unique place to visit. There are many antiques that will remind you of the past. It is a place where your imagination can run wild....Rubel Castle is an interesting and wonderful treat to enjoy in Glendora!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MountainViewMom
50,Who knew this fascinating place was here?,"Check out the Glendora Historical Societ website for more information about this gem (hidden in L.A.) and tours (otherwise not open to the public). Also, watch Huell Howser's tv episode (he actually did two) on youtube to get a better sense of the place. Then visit it -- you'll see a marvel of construction and engineering, see all kinds of historical relics (and junk!), and hear incredible stories about Michael Rubel and his adventures in building it. This is not a hokey tourist trap; you will likely be overwhelmed!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/random55555
40,Fun visit,I took a free tour over spring break and really enjoyed it. I learned a lot about the unusual owner. Lots of fun things to take pictures of. It isn't too much walking so you could probably do this with older kids. Email to make sure that a tour is available!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alli_sun_t
50,Awesome!,"An unforgettable and awe inspiring place. Dreams do come true, but you may have to work hard at it--and get a lot of help from your friends!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/beckyk735
50,A must see!,"What a find! My husband and I were searching for something to do on the weekend and we came across Rubel Castle. It was perfect, as we only live 18 minutes away from the historic site. We thought we could make reservations and go. WRONG it was 5 months before we could get a reservation, but it was well worth the wait. We were fortunate enough to have Richard Macy as our Docent (whom will be 80 this year)! He was a close friend of Michael Rubel, and shared with us with personal stories, and knew all about the castle history. The castle and grounds were amazing. Nothing like I have ever seen before. I need to go back because there was so much to see, I missed a lot! My husband and I have been fortunate to be able to travel around the world, but who knew we could find such a treasure in our own backyard. Before you go, watch the Huell Howser you tube video on the castle.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traceyw537
40,Amazing!,"What a find! Built out of whatever Michael Rubel could find over the course of many years, it is a truly unique place. In building, Michael Rubel just did whatever he felt like. You will find a caboose, a drawbridge, a clocktower, and a graveyard with no on buried there. I was truly anticipating every turn, not knowing what would come next. My only criticism (which gives it 4 rather than 5 stars) was the guide. He was very knowledgeable, but had a bad habit of going off on a complete tangent with stories that were totally unrelated to Rubel Castle and full of unnecessary details. When he stuck to telling us about the castle and its history, he was quite interesting. We were told the tour was supposed to last about 1 1/2 - 2 hours, but ended up lasting nearly 3 hours, because of all of the irrelevant stories.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mom_of_Alex
50,A hidden gem!,"My friend and I like to find interesting historical places to visit. Just when we thought we had exhausted all Southern California options, we found this place. 2 hour tour with Docent, there was so much to look at in every direction, it was incredibly interesting. Our docent, Richard, was a personal friend of the late, quirky Michael Rubel and told us fantastic stories! $10 for 2 hour tour. Glendora Historical Society operates the tours which are only offered a few times per month and reservations are required. Visit the web site for more information.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MeTravel2
50,A hidden gem not to be missed,"Hidden in the suburbs of Glendora is a treat to behold. Behind the high gates of Rubel Farm is a mans vision and dream come true with a ' devil may care attitude. Constructing rooms, walls and bell towers. Old engineering equipment and the likes. Rather than taking a group tour - treat yourself to a memorable private tour with Richard Macy - his is a treat as much as the place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Brandon1968
50,"Eclectic, historical, and fascinating secret hidden in Glendora","I visited the castle this year for the first time since I was a child. I gre up knowing that Rubel's Castle was a magical place where children can imagine a magical life. Now as an adult I thoroughly enjoyed the docent guided tour, California Gold video of the history, and the artifacts housed there by the Glendora Historical Society. Bring your wallet and enjoy some souvenirs from the gift shop. Look for unusual building material like motorcycles built into the walls. See the gardens, train caboose, horses and garages where the family entertained guests. Once you enter the gates and cross the draw bridge you will have plenty to see. There is a fair amount of walking, but the tour is worth it! Call ahead to book a tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/susanjB8213RE
50,"OMG, this place is amazing!","I honestly don't know why they don't show you more interesting photos of this a,azing place online! We nearly didn't do the tour, but the guy who responded to my email was so nice, that I booked in and we're all SO GLAD that we did!This place is absolutely incredible, and our lovely guide (Jim?) was an absolute wealth of knowledge, because not only did he grow up in the area with Michael Rubel, but he knew him and helped to built this absolutely amazing place!They have some people who live in apartments on the premises, and I'm SO envious of them! It would be an absolutely AMAZING place to live! And they only do tour on some days of the month, so the rest of the time you'd be living in this amazing castle undisturbed!Honestly, the castle itself, the drawbridge, the clock tower, the work rooms, just evything about this place is incredible. But still not as incredible as the stories that these guides know about the crazy genius of Michael Rubel. Such an amazing man and such an incredible life!Seriously this place was one of the standout activities that we did during our 5 weeks away, and we did some amazing stuff in LA, Vegas, Palm Springs, San Diego, etc. This beat just about everything hands down, yet it so unknown.This should be a top attraction in the LA area, especially and $10 per adult and $5 per child! And even though the tour said 90 minutes, we were there for 2 1/2 hours, and were wrapt in the stories the whole time! The Glendora Historical Society do an awesome job of running this incredible place in the suburbs of Glendora!Go, you won't regret it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dromomaniac
50,Incredible Find!,"Incredible find in the middle in suburbia with tons of heart and soul. Rubel Castle is more than just an highly reinforced structure filled with rocks and tons of cement, it's about the journey of Michael Rubel, its founder and reason for its very existence.The stories of Michael Rubel are truly larger than life and hilarious. You'll find that Mr. Rubel was a whimsical man with so much wit and charm. The history alone is worth the trip.For those architectural buffs, you will be amazed with the layout of the building, towers, (real working) draw bridge and creative designs.I would take this tour over any of Hearst Castle any day.Tips: Reservations are highly recommended. Don't forget your waivers. Please don't be late (that's just rude).Extra Tip: For those expecting a fancy pants, high end castle. Check you coat and top hat at the door. This is not that kind of castle. Nonetheless, it's a great structure in and of itself, made purely of recycled materials-- only adds to its charm!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stuffany
50,You will be AMAZED!!,"Oh wow, who knew this was in my own hometown when I was growing up!! The dream of Michael Rubel, the castle was started in the 1960s by Michael and his friends who used to have a fort on the land when they were kids. Michael was a guy who could charm just about anyone out of anything and who shared his dream with whoever was interested. The result is one of the most unique attractions I have ever visited. The “Tin Palace” on the property was a former citrus packing warehouse and when I was growing up I used to visit Michael’s mother there with a church group; it was the forerunner of what would come with the castle. The castle is built out of local stone and just about anything else Michael and his friends felt like sticking into the walls (old bottles, motorcycle parts, etc). There is a portcullis, a secret escape tunnel, a tiny house made out of bottles, a railroad caboose, lots of old and unique cars and tractors, a graveyard with no one buried in it, and a one of a kind clock that was ultimately the catalyst for a visit from Prince Philip, who later returned with the Archbishop of Canterbury (or so the story goes). Every inch of the castle and the property is a new curiosity to behold. Several people and a couple of horses still call the “pharm” home but the property is under the stewardship of the Glendora Historical Society with tours offered about a half dozen times a month at a cost of $10. Our guide, Richard, was not only fantastic but is the longest serving guide at the castle as he was a friend of Michael’s and offered to give some curious folks a tour thus starting a long tradition. Not only is Rubel Castle a local treasure but it is listed in the National Register of Historic Places.As I said, I grew up in Glendora and believe me, THIS is the place to visit if you are looking for some local culture and a kitschy, off-the-beaten-path curiosity to tell your friends about. You will be amazed!!!There is a geocache on site for those who are into that sport.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fincaran
