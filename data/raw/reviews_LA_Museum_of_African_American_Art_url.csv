50,A Rare Museum With A Lot To Offer,"This is a small museum located on the top floor of the Macy's building. They have a pretty good collection both temporary and permanent. I was there on a Friday and they were actually closed for installation of a new exhibit. When I told them I was visiting Los Angeles and couldn't come back another day, they welcomed me in anyway. There are many incredible pieces in there. A lot of history. If you are an art lover or even history portrayed in art you will like their collection.After I looked at the new exhibit I was given a short tour of the working areas and then shown the permanent collection. Overall I spent almost an hour looking at the art pieces. Afterwards they pointed me towards a few other museums to check out.This place is definitely a must see if you like African American art. The people that work there will make you feel very welcomed and right at home.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Briman747
