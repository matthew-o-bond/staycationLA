40,Lovely Thursday Morning Stroll along the Waterfront,"This isn't the best Farmers Market I have ever been to, but it is certainly one of the most picturesque. The market is located at the back of Veteran's Park, along the waterfront. If the sun is out one can expect it to be fairly busy.I always walk the entire market, and then on my way back, pick up the items I need. One downfall of the market are the prices. While I understand the items are straight from the farm, apples run $3.50 lb. The fresh strawberries are reasonably priced and always perfectly ripe; they make an excellent strawberry pie.When fruit is in season, there are fruit samples. The Karmel Korn lady gives out free samples and the Karmel Korn is delicious. There are a number of food vendors, fresh flowers, plants, and even a knife sharpener.Whether you buy something or not, it is a lovely hour activity.",luv2trvlRedondoBeach
