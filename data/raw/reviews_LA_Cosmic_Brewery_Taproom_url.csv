50,Dogs and Beer,This place is fantastic. They have alot of different styles of beer so you have plenty to choose from. Its family friendly and they host dog adoptions all the time for handicap dogs and cats. They have one beer designated for the night in which 100% of that beers proceeds goes to help that dog rescue. A hidden gem.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dogsnbeer
50,Self-Serve Convenience,"We stopped in on a Sunday afternoon while visiting several breweries in Torrance. They have a self-serve system whereby you get a card, you slip it into the dispenser, and then take either a taster-size or a full pour. When you're ready to leave you turn in the card and cash out. The staff was very friendly and quite helpful. The beers were great, too. A must see when in Torrance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Billyjoe52
