50,Walk back in time,Mostly as it was on my first visit on the mid-80s. Some nice places for a drink and bite to eat. Also nice for a walk.,StanSF
40,good destination,nice place to watch seals and walk. parking is available on the pier.it is safe to walk with 3 years old if you consider watching the sea and seals by the bench .(still needs to be careful),müge
50,A great place to eat and to see. Beautiful. Lots of nice shops and restaurants.,We ate at Kincaid's and it was excellent. We had the fish and chips and a great view at our table. The service was excellent.,Wendy Guyton
50,Great place to watch sunsets,"We visited the pier a few times while we were staying in the area. There are some shops and restaurants, and it's a great place to watch the sunset. There are sea lions that swim around the pier and you can hear them from almost a mile away:) Worth a visit if you are in the area!",Sarasutter
50,Great Variety,"If you aren't into diversity, you won't like it. It's a close to being in a foreign seaport as it gets. Outstanding Quality Seafood at several locations. Long clean beach. Often see Sea Lions, dolphins, occasionally a whale or two.LOTS of parking, lots of walking on a semi circle pier. Shops all along the peir. Alcohol served at some of the restaurants. Two levels of places to stop at. As good of a people watching area as there is. The diversity of the people you see is simply amazing. Large marina attached to the Pier. Bike path goes for 22 miles in the South Bay and it is near thrSouthern end at Redondo. You can surf, play volleyball, just lay out in the sun right next to the pier. You will also see many many fisherman using the pier at all times. Pelicans frequent the area, most of the time. Very safe secure area.",Judpma012
50,Clean Public Beach,"This was a good experience for us. Parked for $2, stayed for sunset, walked around and had poke by the pier. People are nice and there were no homeless people around . Police surveys the area quite often, for meters and everything else. You can rent bikes etc. Pier is long and free for going there to fish. We saw a lot who are fishing. Not bad to spend a couple of hours- not to mention a lot of restaurants in the area.",LoveLiveTravel1976
30,Beautiful beach area,"Love walking the boardwalk and pier. Could have more shops. One thing for out of towners, make sure to feed the meter. We didn't see a sign and everyone else around us had expired time on meters. We came back to find a ticket on our car 15 min before leaving. Told by city police that there is a sign regarding locals having a sticker for free parking.we failed to see the sign and one of the beach goers we asked initially couldn't give us any advice. Next time pay their meter or have a $50 ticket.",CJG
40,Lots to Do- Good Value,They have everything here fro an arcade to a 360 degree bar overlooking the water. You can pick your own oyster to harvest a pearl and have it put into your setting of choice at a few of the shops. The pricing is good al around and you can even fish off the end of the pier.,SoCalTig
20,Tired pier which could be so much better,"Redondo Pier is lacking in what it could be, mainly accommodating take out huts and tat shops with a few restaurants / bars mixed in.It really feels underutilised and rather tatty compared to similar piers in adjoining towns which is a real shame.",OnTravelsAgain
50,HUGE Thumbs Up from NYC,"With many pier options, we were not sure which to visit (on limited time). The Redondo Beach Pier has it all - plus plenty of opportunities for seal sitings! It’s clean, safe and great food options. Will definitely visit again.",T Del Monico
30,Adventurebuddies42 goes to Redondo Beach pier,"We live near the pier. Although we do go a lot we would say it’s average. Older restaurants and shops along the pier, old arcade and games. The parking lot at night has had some issues regarding safety so be careful. There are paddle boats and bikes you can rent to see the sea lions which is fun but be careful the sea lions have a lot of flies and if you get too close they stay with you until you paddle quite a bit away! Various restaurants and activities average cleanliness factor.",The Adventure Buddies
40,Nice place to explore,"We stayed at the Crowne Plaza Hotel and would walk to this area. Many locals go to this area to fish and there are several restaurants, bars and quick snacks. We made a stop at the Bella's Geleto and walked the area.",SS_Forever
50,Very enjoyable,We spent a lovely warm day exploring all the shops and restaurants of the pier. Incredibly interesting and perfect for casual visiting.,Marilyn A

40,Waves of beauty,"This is a uniquely shaped pier with good parking and tasty restaurants from local to fancy. Variety of local shops, beautiful views, live, fresh fish and seafood to eat, paddle boarding, whale watching, and even a gym close by! It also edged up to veterans park, a nice green space for picnics and watching the waves.",runnermaryc
50,Family Getaway,Wife & son playing at the beach while my daughter & I fished at the pier. Had an awesome seafood dinner with ice cream to cap the day. Such a wonderful time with the family & it all happened in one place.,Faustino S

50,Passing Time,"I reserved dinner at Chart House and decided to stop by the Pier to pass time. Since we were 1 hour early for dinner. We have been to Redondo Beach Pier before, but it's been several years ago now.. Still pretty much the same, bars are lit and busy, restaurants are still vibrant. Lots of people just hanging out and having a good time..",JustAretha
50,Something for everyone,"I live in the South Bay where there are three cities and three piers. Each Pier has it's own character and demographic. For me, I gravitate towards the Redondo Beach Pier for its charm and character plus for it's old and new restaurants, bars and cute shops. There's something for everyone. Sports bar to fine dining. Live music and Karaoke. The beach and sunsets.",V S
40,Great sea food,Walked along here lots to see and do very busy on weekends but quoted in the week lovely harbour and places to eat,David A
20,Disappointed,"We walked the pier around 10 am and there were not many stores or restaurants open. Many of the buildings are old and run down and I don't know that I would eat from some of the smaller shops based on what you see... The farmers market was fun (every Thursday) but other than that, a bit disappointed as we chose a hotel to be close to the pier.",ndmom11
30,"Long sandy beach, complimented by the Pier","Visited both the pier area and the beach at the end of September. Plenty of renovation/redecoration work going on so not sure if this was the reason why a number of shops were closed. Pier has a number of places you can get food and drink but didn’t have time to try any. Had a relaxed walk around the pier and beach so if you have time would recommend you give it a try try. The long sandy beaches is spectacular and the place looks very safe for youngsters. Parking plentiful and relatively low cost for a beach area. On the Thursday we attended there was also a farmers market, and this is worth a visit.",Robert H
50,Excellent food and Pier,I loved the layout of this pier. It was iconic! Fresh seafood was everywhere. We ate at Crab House - twice! The food was so fresh and loved the service and atmosphere there! The little shops were quaint. Will definitely go back.,@vlee7722
30,No sea lions,"Visited in hopes of seeing sea lions but didn’t see one at all. I will say it’s rough getting around this area with a wheelchair, lots of paths that lead to dead end huge curbs, so would have to turn around and go all the way back the way we came. The views of the ocean were pretty.",Dalezava
30,Hmmm Looking Run Down,"We took a walk from from our hotel to the pier, the pier area and shops appearance etc seemed dirty and run down. We were there just after Labor Day and some businesses weren’t open or maybe unoccupied. We did enjoy our meal at Tony’s on the Pier especially the Red Velvet Cake. We continued our walk around the pier and saw people fishing and having a good time.",Barbie D
30,Nice beach (smaller so it seems more crowded),"Came here for the first time, on a Sunday of a long weekend. The beach is narrow from the water but we found a decent space to settle in. Kids had a blast paying in the sand. The sand is a little more grainy, compared to Huntington or Santa Monica (the only other 2 beach and piers we’ve been to thus far in Cali). Overall though the beach is good.The pier is nice too. Lots of restaurants and shops to browse around. The restaurants seem to serve about the same food items, but it’s convenient and decent taste. Okay price.What’s really nice is the parking lot is right at the pier and cost is good.Overall good place for spending the whole day bumming around on the beach. 😉",dinfamily2009
40,Worth a wander,Worth a walk along the pier and the surrounding areas. Places to get food and drinks and shops. Lovely views of the Pacific and lovely seafood available on the Pier.,Tatiana747

10,Run down & smells like stale oil,This place is a dump! It's an embarrassment to the city. It smells like stale oil from all the fried food. It's super run down and dirty too.,Iz G
50,I know locals aren't supposed to like it...,"But I love this place! I get it, the restaurants may not be like the ones on Pier Ave up the beach, but this is my favorite pier in California! Its a great place to walk, jog, people watch, take photos, just watch the ocean roll by underneath the pier (how many piers have a place where you can watch waves roll directly toward you and crash onto the beach?). Not sure if that makes sense, but if you walk out on the pier you'll know what I mean. Anyway, I find this place magical and love it.",Erin G
50,Great place to stroll and enjoy the scenery,This is a beautiful location. It is a great area to walk and enjoy the ocean breezes and views. Take a stroll and enjoy.,RunningOnAndOn
50,Great chilled beach vibe,"This is our second time staying near the Pier, we love the vibe, the food places and the view. In Sumner they have concerts on the pier.",DiTaylor65
30,Visiting the area? It's worth going...,"This is a nice place to take people from out of town because you can look at the ocean, maybe grab some snacks at some of the seafood shacks, see the live crabs crawling in the tanks... it's cleaner than I remember from years ago when I visited as a child so they're keeping it up well. Lots of fishermen - people-watching overall is great.",Mary V
20,Interesting Clash of Cultures and Heritage,"When you first walk on the pier you will notice photographs of the early days before 1900. Check out the women's bathing suits which don't exactly resemble those of today. AS you walk out the pier, you will find all kinds of shops from gem stores to souvenirs to suchi, burritoes, gelatos and pizza. You will also find dining spots that have been there for decades such as Nick's Seafood. At the end of the pier are the fishermen, well worth watching. WE were intrigrued by the whole scene.",Pfitzgerald1946
50,Great food,Lots of great seafood to try at almost any price range. For a fancy meal in a relaxed environment try Tony’s. If you like picking out your fish before you eat it then try Quality seafood.There are also several cute souvenir shops. In the summer there is live music too.,Melissa S
30,Not our thing,We visited the Pier on a very hot weekend so it was hectic as can be expected. The paved walkway along the beach was more to our liking but the shops and food are convenient at the pier.,dimar992001
50,"Yummy food, lovely meander","We thoroughly enjoyed walking the Redondo Beach Pier, which features lots of restaurants, ranging from cheap to pricey. Ice cream? You bet. Fishing? Yup. Even a few bars and coffee shops. It has everything, as well as access to the beach for strolling.",amershon
50,Relaxing Beach,"Each beach cities has different characteristics, and this beach is a relaxing local beach. Not much tourists, not much surfers, nothing special, but this is always good choice to visit to have a relaxing beach walk and some seafood and snacks.",Byron G
50,It's a Bird's eye view,"Walk the experience of the Redondo Beach Pier, feel and breathe the ocean air, view bird life, see dolphins swim, catch a glimpse of a whales tail, watch the waves coming into the wide stretch of sandy shoes...all that and it didn't cost a cent! Now that's an experience I had at Redondo Beach Pier let alone the magnificent 360 view",Ozzie2Trav
20,Tacky but nice looking pier,Lots of tourist stuff which makes it tacky but the pier itself is actually really nice to walk around and often you can see pods of dolphins close up from it.,D P
30,Restrictive rules,"Should be great, but the pier and restaurants along the pier look tired and unappealing. Very restrictive rules include no dogs anywhere on the pier or in nearby parks (even on leashes).",Tom F

50,Nice place for a walk,Walking along the pier and beach was refreshing with the sun and slight breeze. It is a safe place to be. There are several restaurants and shops.,Rickeys-Travels
50,Wonderful the way it its,"I think this is a great pier. There are a ton of food options on the waterfront along funnel cakes, ice cream, desserts, drinks, etc. There is a lot of open space and tons of things for the whole family to do (including an arcade). It’s not a super fancy, high-end pier but I like it that way. Some people on here are asking for a refurb but I disagree, I like it the way it is.",Rafa
50,Neighborhood Pier,"This pier is not so crowded or busy as Santa Monica or other types of piers.

40,Lovely scenery,"Went here on a Monday to have lunch with my husbands family. It was a nice cloudy day. Not too crowded since it was a weekday. We enjoyed bird watching and the fresh air. There are small shops for souvenirs, food stalls and people fishing. Parking is $2/hr. Enjoyed our lunch at Quality Seafood. Would love to comeback here and maybe try biking.",Gee Selle
30,Nice for an afternoon lunch,"Stopped here for a nice afternoon lunch and stroll. Enjoyed our lunch at quality seafood. Bars for lunch too and some basic souvenir shops. Easy parking. Agree with some other reviews, place could use an update and refurb.",dinerdon
40,A fun place to visit and explore,"Whether you need something for the beach (towels, hats, sun screen), want to buy a souvenir, or are hungry for lunch or gelato, the Pier has it all. Check out the shops and restaurants and fish off the top level or check out the boats and more shops on the bottom level. My young grandsons enjoy a walk around the pier.",gr8fish2017
50,Fun area to explore,"We’ll definitely be coming back! My children and I enjoyed exploring the shops in the pier, looking at boats and watching the waves roll in. We liked that this pier didn’t have franchise type shops and restaurants. It was a more local and authentic experience!",Amy F
50,Beautiful and clean pier,I’ve very extensive pier with many nice restaurants and shops. My wife and I enjoy stopping here every time we are in Redondo Beach.,TJP7301
40,Nice place to get away and enjoy the great ocean view,"Redondo Beach Pier is one of the old piers along the Los Angeles County coastline. It still retains some of the old charm with nice restaurants over the water and some quirky shops on the pier. The large expanse of beach is to the south of the pier and you can have nice time strolling around the pier which has some great vistas of the ocean and the coastline, especially to the south, towards Palos Verdes Peninsula. You can sometimes see shorebirds on the pier and sea lions in the water. It can be a real treat. There is a good size parking lot adjacent to the beach. Visited the pier during winter, so there was not much crowd, but there are plenty of nice places to get a drink or food. Although I did not stay that late, it would be a great place to see the sunset and watch the sun sink into the Pacific Ocean.",geotech522
40,Scenic stroll,"After dinner at the Chart House we strolled to the pier. It is now my new favorite pier to people watch. Food, shops, music and ocean views. Be sure to check it out when near Redondo Beach.",KarenK518
50,Great day trip in Redondo Beach!,Was in LA area for a day before heading to Hawaii. Was recommended by a friend to come to Redondo Beach as I had an early flight and didn’t want to hit traffic or be in a place full of crowds. So glad she recommended this as Redondo Beach is perfect for what I was looking for. Parking is only $3/hr and there are a ton of things to see and do on the Pier.,Diana
40,Pleasant pier,"This is a very pleasant place to spend a couple of hours. There are the usual shops with souvenirs. And there are some nice places to eat. We recommend Tony’s on the pier which has very good seafood. There is plenty of parking and not too expensive. The best time to visit on weekends is probably between 8 and 11 AM before it gets too crowded, specially during the summertime. And after you spend some time at the pier, you can take a short stroll are a much longer walk on the Running parallel to the beach.",vincemc
50,Great Place,"Good Food, Good Shopping, Beautiful place to be. I would highly recommend if vacationing in that area.",ay0unkin
40,The Pier,"The Redondo Beach Pier is a fun place with the usual touristy shops, but also there are many places that have very good food. Tony's is old school. Kincaids' is upscale. Don't miss all the little restaurants on the boardwalk. The Slip Bar is very good. And of course there is the famous Naja's with hundreds of different beers available and I think over 70 on tap.There is fishing off the end of the pier too.",Tpart2
50,Breathtaking!,"I loved everything about this iconic pier. There is plenty to keep people of all ages amused with shops, restaurants and bars while parking was easy and plentiful though we did go in March so it may be a bit more difficult in the height of summer. From the head of the pier on a good day you can view seals and dolphins in all their glory against the backdrop of the fabulous Pacific Ocean. There are plenty of seats to rest on, photo opportunities at every turn. For a great family day out I highly recommend Redondo Beach Pier.",kencat1966
50,Birthday brunch,After brunch we walked the wharf. It was COLD & windy this day.Quick tour & ran back to our car.Nice wharf!!,alma v
40,shopping and food,We were able to see Dolphins and seals from the Pieir which was cool. There is quite a few places to eat and shop on the Pier as well.,Kevin C
50,Old and the New,We just loved hanging around on the pier. Just to sit on the International Boardwalk and take in the crashing Pacific waves or to take a snack at one of the many street food kiosks or search for souvenirs or beach and sportswear in the shops. Ambling on to the newer pier to watch the fishermen and the gulls and the occasional pelican and listen to a sealion 'barking'. I could go on. Definitely a place to make memories and to return to.,Vonnilew
30,Fresh seafood market is unique,"The pier does not have a huge appeal to me because it is a bit on the shabby side. The seafood market downstairs is unique with fish and shell fish that you can pick out and have cooked. Chinese, Mexican, some pubs, some junk food. There is a bit of everything but nothing terribly nice. There is even a new age place that does readings. You can also purchase passage on vessels going out to sea for whale watches and other adventures.",mlaustin
50,"Lovely views, great people watching, interesting events, decent restaurants","The Redondo Beach pier is about to be renovated, so it can be a bit scruffy in places, but if you want gorgeous sunsets, etc., it is one of the best spots on this coastline for a walk.",TravelersHigh77
40,Beautiful scenery,"We walked the pier and grandkids loved climbing on the rocks. We could hear seals but weren't close enough to see up close, saw many sunbathing on a buoy. Water was crystal clean could see right to the rocky bottom. Great place to take a walk and enjoy the California sunshine!",REW135
40,Nice views,Interesting place to enjoy a stroll. The harbor seals are quite vocal. You can get right up on the pelicans,kdbauder
50,Great sea air,Great place to visit to get away from the busy day to day activities. Ocean views of many boats and a red buoy. Beautiful harbor view. lots to see and very relaxing,That Dude
50,Game night,"Do you ever have those days when your in the mood to play Pac Man or skeeball? I sure do which is why I love coming to Redondo Beach Pier Fun Factory arcade. Let's take a step back in time to the 70's and play some retro arcade games. Perfect for a date night, a friend's game night or even family time it's a place that offers retro fun for everyone. How about taking a ride on the Tilt-A-Whirl? On regular days it's $2 but on rainy days it's a discounted price so why not come out and have some fun!? One thing I really love about Redondo Beach Pier is it's ease of parking. Paying at the meeter is very simple and easily managed with the feature to receive text notifications of when time is running out and if you would like to add more time. There is no more need to run back to the meeter just simply reply to the text and add more time without ever leaving your fun. This pier has a lot to offer from nice dive bars,great food options, fun attractions, shops and finishing.",Staycation Vacations
50,Our pier overlooks the most incredible part of the Pacific Ocean while also offering lots of activities!,"Redondo Beach pier is a great place to look over the ocean, watch surfers, get food to eat at one of the restaurants, enjoy cocktails with friends/family, go shopping, go fishing or shopping! Also checkout the International Boardwalk while visiting the pier or the harbor for a harbor tour and sunsets are quite impressive as well...there's lots to do so enjoy :)",Jeff Ginsburg
40,"A calm, relaxing, breezy, scenic stroll along the ocean","Redondo Beach Pier is a laid back place that is just great for a wonderfully scenic stroll alongside the ocean, in addition to dining, shopping and entertainment. Apart from the pier, the beautiful beach stretch offers many outdoor activities including biking, jogging, kayaking, paddle boarding, surfing, swimming, boating, fishing and so on. The Pier also features a panoramic marina.The Pier has a long history dating back to 1889. However, by the time it marked its centennial in 1992, it was already into its seventh version! While the present pier is made of concrete unlike many of its predecessors that were made of wood, it still incorporates design elements that are a throwback to earlier times.Redondo Landing is the gateway building to the Pier – it also showcases some black and white photographs from history captioned “Living the Beach Life”. Among some of the interesting snaps are ones that show the extreme measures ladies had to follow to ensure they did not fall foul of the ‘modesty’ regulations of the 1920s and 1930s!The boardwalk at the Pier also has a bust that commemorates George Freeth who caught the attention of millionaire Henry Huntington. Of Hawaiian and Irish ancestry, Freeth’s specialty was the then novel sport of standup paddle board surfing. He was advertised as the “The Man Who Can Walk on Water”! Freeth is also credited with introducing the sport of water polo and for being the first official life guard on the Pacific coast.Multiple dining choices, casual to fine dining, are available at the Pier. Tony’s on the Pier is amongst the oldest ones. El Torito dates back to the early 1970s. Maison Riz offering French and Japanese cuisine is one of the more recent additions to the Pier. Most of these restaurants offer panoramic ocean views as well.Some worthwhile shopping options include fresh water pearl jewellery as also sea shells shaped into cute collectibles.Realizing that the Pier was getting dated, a plan to revamp the Redondo Beach waterfront was conceptualized to take it back to its glory days. However, that plan has now stalled and the Redondo Beach City Council has withdrawn its bid for the project that was supposed to be a joint development with the California Coastal Commission and a real estate developer.This is possibly because the majority of Redondo Beach residents voted against this development fearing its environmental impact and citing other concerns. With the beachfront revitalization plan having been derailed, the Pier is now back to its glorious past-uncertain future status.One wonders what the future will bring to Redondo Beach and its historic Pier – for the moment though, it remains one of the best places for a calm, relaxing, breezy, scenic stroll along the ocean.",TMenon
50,Day out!,"Came here because my teen daughter is a big fan of the old show The O.C. While the show was set in Newport Beach, scenes like the life guard station and the cafe were shot here at the Redondo pier.Pleas note, that parking is plentiful but you need coins for the old fashioned meters.",2flyby
50,Attractive walk,"We walked here and enjoyed the attractive mix of shops, places to eat, and the fact that the pier is more than just straight.",Jim & Bea
40,Better than it was,They have updated a lot of the pier and its easier to walk around now. Bathrooms are always a little gross and some places are still run down. Fun place to visit. Beautiful views,J6063CWjamess
40,Not what it was,"This pier keeps losing its luster. It used to be full of unique shops and restaurants but now it's mostly overly expensive eatery's and cheap shops. The pier is neat and you get good views from the horshoe shape but the overall King Harbor experience is slowly declining. The food places are very expensive for average food. There's a few decent bars but you can't take kids there. It's just not what it was 20+ years ago. Each time it gets damaged and they rebuild it, it gets a little worse.",Brian V
50,Fantastic,"The Pier is awsum. A wrap around so you don’t miss anything. It has everything, bars, cafes, restaurants and stores to cater for everything. Highly recommend a visit",Tracey30B
50,Awesome,Redondo Beach pier is always an excellent time families from all across the world always find a way to make it to check out this worst Historical location. They have a variety of food courts and shopping locations located throughout the pier if you're visiting don't forget to check out the arcade or if you're into Athletics bring a skateboard or a bike or rollerblades they have a strand that you can bring your bike and ride along with other items pay attention to your surroundings It can get a little hectic sometimes,Peter M
30,Beautiful Sunset & Great Seafood,"Gorgeous sunset over the boats in the water. Make sure to go to Quality Seafood (largest fish market on the west coast) and get oysters on the half shell.The pier itself isn’t that impressive though, pretty touristy. I’d recommend checking out Hermosa Beach and Manhattan Beach over this area.",Emily H
50,Nice place to walk around,Quite scenic. Beach shops and food outlets. Good restaurants. Convenient parking. Fishing off the pier is permitted though watch for warnings.,CalgaryWoman
30,Not a Quaint Place But Has Its Own Character.,"Definitely not a quaint place but Redondo Beach Pier area does have its own character. Hermosa Beach and Manhattan Beach are just beaches and piers, but Redondo Beach Pier area is like a community of shops and eateries, many of them are run by Mexican Americans, it is very local. You see people fishing on the pier, on the rocks, on the shore, something you won't see in Hermosa and Manhattan Beach. Most of the eateries there are diners and fast food places, no gourmet food offers. if you are looking for a quaint place to visit, Redondo Beach is not for you.",2CanadianTravellers
40,Huge pier,Great place to take a stroll. We went at night so we didn’t get to see the sunset but I’m sure that if we had it would just have made our experience that much better.,Gabby
30,Concrete,"If you have never seen a pier before you might enjoy this place, or if you want an evening or afternoons stroll by the sea, this could be a good choice. But compared to Santa Monica there are limited attractions and it is a bit of a concrete monstrosity. The high point is Kincaids, an excellent restaurant.",SB01
40,Beautiful view,It’s worthy place to visit if you are close by. Also I definitely recommend to grab a Gelato ice cream and have a seat staring at the sun and fisherman’s.,RenatoCarneiro
50,Fond Memories,"Have been coming to Redondo Beach Pier for years and have nothing but fond memories. Lots of fresh seafood with lots of choices for something else if fresh seafood isn't your thing. Quality Sea Food has lots of live choices as well! Steamers from the east coast are so good. Crab, lobster and clam chowder are also all fresh and delicious. Even have a gaming area for the kids and the churros are off the hook. Used to be super cheap but as the times go, prices have crept up yet still reasonable for the fresh air and seafood selections. Love the live selections, especially the steamer clams and live sweet shrimp.",AKTraveler

30,Due for a refresh....,"So this is my pier.... I love my pier...but it is dated and due for a renovation. There are some spots that have been around for years. First is Quality seafood...fresh and live cooked on the spot - probably the busiest of all the seafood outlets. Tony's is a favorite - a long time classic...and Barney's Beanery (bar) is a good spot to catch a game, Kincaid's, Samba Brazilian food are some others worth consideration . However most of the eateries here are mom and pop fried food stops which have been dilapidated for years. There has been a good amount of bicycle theft so we do not leave our bikes out any longer unfortunately even when locked up.This pier is home to the only sport fishing in the LA bay area. This is where you would leave to go out for half and full day trips.Of all the piers this is the best one to fish from....lot's of space to spread out compared the other local piers.Parking is pretty good too and not too much of a fight...even in busier times of the year.For the last few years proposals have been made and shot down to reinvest and update. It seems developers cannot sync with the people...and vice-versa. It's kind of sad because there are always folks who are afraid of change (aka progress). Change will come...it has too in order to keep this place relevant and operating successfully.",John R
50,Quick getaway,Love this Pier. We like it over all others. Great atmosfear and good options and pricing.Tony's on the pier is a must stop.,MJTAS

Beach had seaweed and a lot of screaming kids having fun. Looked like a day camp of some sort for youths. Near the pier so you could get a bite to eat. Very close to a paid underground parking lot which was really convenient.",KkFiff
50,Love the place,"Excellent choice to go for a walk with the family, excellent view, not very crowded, parking space available",GiaHSS
10,Gross gross gross,Redondo should be ashamed. This is just gross. It is so rundown and smells like old cheap cooking oil and rotten fish. All the restaurants in the middle serve frozen deep fried crap. Took a friend from out of town and we both were appalled. There are two restaurants at the right end that are okay if you go at night so you don't have to see the surrounding area.,Iz G
40,Lots of places to eat and shop,Lots of places to eat and shop for a variety of beach food and items. Plenty of tables and benches to sit and people watch as well. Several people also trying to catch some fish.,m s
50,4th of July fun!,While on this beach we were so grateful to see 5 dolphins gracing the ocean! It was a first for our kiddos. Fireworks in the distance made this an amazing 1st time beach experience for the kids!,slgreen09
50,Strolling the Pier,We love to stop and have lunch at Kincaids and then stroll along the pier. Love watching the ocean and all of the people strolling and enjoying a beautiful California day.,IndySig
20,Not what it used to be!!!,"In the early 20th century, the Redondo Pier was one of the biggest draws in California. Today, the place needs to be renewed and updated. It has maintained the same basic look for decades and its age shows. Redondo residents need to vote to allow the city to upgrade this well known attraction and make it the jewel it once was again! A historic and nice area that could be improved upon with little effort.",CD1970
50,Good for families,"Great way to see the ocean for people who are too timid to swim or play in the water. Watch fisherman, swimmers and surfers. Good places to eat lunch or dinner here.",James

Boat tours galore! went on one boat tour was only 20 dollars each and we had dolphins following our ship. A beautiful and fun sight to see.,H6151ZNeds
40,A jury on our piers...,"We like the coastal attractions that still have an air of their history -- The Redondo Beach pier has not been scrubbed clean and sanitized into a theme park-like attraction. Modern food places and attractions sidle up against older merchants with classic wares, at many price points for the diverse visitors.Highly recommended!",Marlin O
30,Nice view when you are on the pier but that is about it.,"You get a nice view when you walk to the end of the pier, but don't go there to eat or shop as much of the retail and restaurant space attached is empty. There are 2 seafood markets where you can eat and a few bars and small restaurants but some looked dicey. There are a few trinket/t-shirt shops as well if you need a gift that says Redondo Beach but that is about it.",Momof2Virginia
50,Crowded,Nice place to hang out. There's covered parking. Be patient because you will have to drive around a few minutes to get a spot. The pier is awesome. Fishing is allowed and great food all around. The beach area is crowded. But is very cool. Loved it.,Leta B

40,Nice place,"We spent an hour or so walking around Redondo Beach and the Pier. Caught a few minutes of the sunset. There are plenty of places to eat and shop, and the pier is clean. We didn't eat anywhere, only walked around. For the beach itself, we prefer Santa Monica, but Redondo Beach is a place to check out if in the area.",BaseballFan5
50,An hour or two,"Don’t think this is gonna be someplace that you will be able to spend an entire afternoon. You can go and have a meal, walk around 3 or 4 stores and then hang around the pier. There’s a boardwalk you can walk as well. There’s underground parking for $2 per hour.This is not someplace that you could spend a whole day, but you could probably enjoy an hour or two.",FunintheOCsun
30,Great views of the Ocean - Cheap shops,"The Pier is dated. Shops have your typical novelty items. Nothing upscale for food. Plenty of cheap eats, nothing looked great.If you're in the area, it's a fun use of time. I wouldn't make it a destination or go out of my way to get there.",Samuel F

For the kiddos there is Arcade galore in the bottom floor, let’s not forget you can rent fishing poles and buy bait right in the pier!",Yesenia F
50,This pier is not your typical pier.,"This pier comes from 2 directions and houses many shops and restaurants. The pier is wide and a great place to watch the sail boats that are nearby. Adjacent to the pier, there is a lower area that houses many places to buy and eat fresh fish as well as an arcade which is fun for young families.",sherry19112016
20,"Touristy, old","I guess if you have never seen the ocean and are into tourist traps, this might be interesting. The beach nearby is good and you are likely to see dolphins (and seals on the buoys), but most of the restaurants are old and tacky, there are far too many shops that are selling touristy junk, and the place is not clean at all. The live seafood market sucks its water that it uses to keep the crabs alive from the very back corner of the area where the boats dock and the water is extremely polluted with gasoline and oil. One of the big attractions is a giant cigarette boat that has rows of seats for what looks like about 100 people. There’s an old indoor amusement park with Tilt-A-Whirls, etc. You get the picture.",Julian Q
20,"A pier that is rather tacky, smelly and not at all attractive.","Having already visited Manhattan Beach Pier and Hermosa Beach Pier I was very disappointed with the Redondo Beach Pier... Not really much of a pier at all, it was dirty, noisy, smelly and so unattractive I didn't even take a single photograph. Go to Manhattan Beach instead it's fabulous compared to Redondo Beach Pier.",Roberts69
40,"Walk, Have Fun, enjoy","I loved the ambience and the atmosphere here, from our early morning walks where it was quiet and you could enjoy the lovely views, to when later in the day it got super busy and people where having fun.

40,"Stroll the Pier, feast on Yummy food, and enjoy the beauty of nature","First off, I have grown up in Redondo Beach, and I love visiting Northern California and Oregon Beach towns, because they are timeless. I do not subscribe to the theory everything has to be new. I love the cobblestone streets in Italy and Germany. I love the thatched roofs in England. And I love the Redondo Beach pier.Nothing tastes better than a freshly made corn dog and a cup of freshly squeezed lemonade from one of the original Hot Dog stands while you sit at a table near the dipped ice cream store. Seagulls can be seen drifting in the wind. There are kites blowing in the wind from the nearby kite store. The smell of the homemade churros entices you to buy a churro. Splurge and enjoy as they are crisp and so yummy. And, don't forge the homemade potato chips not too far from the dipped ice cream.The pier allows us to remember the simple things in life---the sound of the waves, the cries from the seagulls, the sunlight glistening on the water, the clanging of the buoy, a sailboat drifting by, a flopping fish that has just been caught by a fisherman, and surfers trying to catch a wave. And lets not forget the incredible sunset that can be seen off the end of the pier. Life is Good.Who needs a fancy mall, when you are surrounded by beauty.",luv2trvlRedondoBeach
40,Good place to visit but gets busy,"The Redondo Beach pier brings a very diverse group of people. Many places to eat and drink and those gifts everyone likes to buy when they go to a local place like this Beach City.Good thing is they do have a police sub station on the pier so sometimes it might not feel totally safe for a family , but never had a problem. The ocean view is great and you can even fish from this pier at specific points.",Michael S
50,We Love Redondo Pier,"We come often, their is so much to do as a family!You can just spend the day at the beach or visiting on the pier. You can choose from every kind of food and every price range.No matter what you do, the pier is great for children and families. We have made this a regular get away and we’ll continue to be can!",Psi4power
50,Secret get-away pier in southbay,"Of all the piers in the southbay area, I would rate Redondo Beach Pier the best.Parking is easy and relatively cheap. 2 hours for $3.50 or so. And right by the ocean!Pier has lots of restaurants and activities you can sign up, from paddle boat to whale watching etc.Pier has free movies, free concerts etc! And sea birds and pelicans etc are constantly hanging the human while many of them are fishing in a section of the pier.Seals, dolphins, whales are frequently spotted from the pier.And of course, enjoy the sunset.I hesitated to write this as I want to keep Redondo Beach for the locals like it always have been. But when I think about all the beaches and piers north and south of LAX, in terms of food, activities, safety, parking etc, Redondo Beach Pier is the best in my opinion.",AngyChin
10,Do not go here,"We were looking for r a way to spend time walking and enjoying the fresh air before flying home. Previous trips we have always gone to Santa Monica or Venice beach which are both 5 stars. Redondo is dirty and smelly and a rip off, the arcade is dirty and the whole place is terrible. We left after one hour and headed to Venice. The information I had read advised there were parks and lots to do for young kids and families. I hope the planned update helps this place but for now....avoid!!!!",Palmspringsforever
40,Time warp,"The pier takes you back in time. The arcade is leaving at the end of the the year where else will you be able to play ms paceman, win a mystery box, ride the tiltawhirl, play unending $.25 games, etc. plenty of food choices including the fish market. Great family place.",JOHN W
40,Super spot to spend a few hours!,"Loads to do and see here, lots of little shops, restaurants and bars to enjoy. The crabs and lobsters on offer are excellent. There's also great little touristy shops where you can pick up a gift for home. Well worth a visit.",Dec Brennan
30,Cool but dated,Redondo Pier is cool but seems to lack in capitalizing upon it’s potential. The parking is easy and it is an interesting walk but alot of the structure is in disrepair giving it a seedy appearance. There are cool restaurants and some decent gift shops tucked in here and there. A seal was swimming below barking at fishermen hoping for morsels. Worth the visit but I left feeling like it could be so much more.,LockwoodNH

50,fun tourist and wildlife watching,"So many seabirds plus marine mammals and plenty of fishing boats (plus tourists) to watch from shady or sunny areas, depending on your preference. You can watch the sketchy herons ogle the people fishing as well. Good for kids as well as people with limited mobility since there is full accessibility.",kcdenman
30,Nice for a short visit,"A good place to pop in. It's nice to spend an hour here to wander around. There are tourist shops with some cute stuff. There is fried food and ice cream. There is a nostalgic, old school looking bar there, we didn't get to go in. There are many people fishing off the pier. It had nice views over the water.",Jessica B
40,something for everyone,"From the old style, boardwalk arcade with games of fun and chance to fast food, boardwalk treats and fine dining, this location is great from families, couples and just about everyone. Handicap access is in place for almost the entire area. Fishing is permitted from the pier in certain locations. This location is wonderful for people watching and relaxing as well. There is a parking deck at the pier that starts at $3/hr and may range upwards to $6/hr during peak periods, holidays or special events ( check website for rates) I would recommend this location to all.",Jerseybob175
40,Lots to do and see,"Stayed at the hotel across the street for a long weekend. It was nice to be able to walk across the street to visit the pier. There are many good bars, restaurants, and shops to enjoy. There is even an arcade for the whole family. From the pier you can see all kinds of human and wildlife activity. We saw paddle boarders and sightseeing boats. There are a ton of sea lions in the area, and we even saw three dolphins swim right up near the beach to frolic in the shallows. Early March, but the weather was beautiful and the beach & pier were not too crowded. You can rent paddle boats, charter a glass bottom boat to show you the ocean wonders, or rent fishing gear to catch fresh fish from the pier. If you don't want all that work, there are at least two fish markets where you can buy fresh fish, either cooked to order or wrapped to take home.",USAPappa
40,Great attraction,"50 years ago my wife and I were living in Redondo Beach as newlyweds and the pier was one of our favorite places to visit whether to watch the sunset, have ice cream or eat at a seafood restaurant (Castagnola’s). Returned for a visit after 45 years and enjoyed our selves every much as before even though it has changed a little after suffering major damage in a storm a few years ago.",Steve T
40,a lot has changed over the years,"Been going to the pier/boardwalk/King Harbor area since the 60's through early 90's. It used to be quiet and peaceful with not too many people around. Recently went back over Labor Day weekend at night. So Cal was having a massive heatwave and it was hot and humid, even at the beach where it's normally more mild. There were all kinds of people & kids all over the pier area. A different scene for sure. Some came from as far as Adelanto. Though I prefer a quieter scene without commotion, I gave this a higher rating (for other travelers) because some piers are just that, piers and nothing else. They have a lot of businesses here and a parking structure.",NativeAngelena

20,Shabby chiq,"Walked here whilst in the area for work. It’s pleasant enough but unless you just want to sit and people watch there’s not much else here. It’s hardly what I’d describe as ‘beautiful’, it’s just a typical California coastline. Having said that the beach is sandy so would be ok to sunbathe in summer months. The pier is quaint with fisherman catching small stingrays but I thought the cafes on the pier were very overpriced. I wouldn’t recommend making a special visit to Redondo unless you just happened to be staying locally & needed to kill some time! It has the feeling of a ‘dying’ resort.",Nick S
50,Don't miss out,"Piece in the local paper on the passing of Warren Miller, skiing's original film maker, and his impact on city council when the California Beaches were under attack from developers.

50,FAVORITE LA AREA BEACH,"A lot of attention is paid to the Santa Monica and Venice beaches and for very good reasons. Each has a great sandy beach in common yet their own feel. Redondo Beach has a great sandy beach as well as its own feel and should not be missed if visiting the area. All three are equally great for people watching but each is unique. Along the Redondo Beach pier are numerous restaurants, places for libations, souvenir shops mixed with fresh seafood vendors, fishing boats, some for charters, glass bottom boat tours, locals fishing and ample parking. Take the time to at least check it out.",Itza S

Many boat excursions available, dock fishing and family friendly activities. If you are looking for a spot with a lot of action, this is not it, however if you are looking to get away from large crowds, I would recommend this pier.

40,Great people watching,"The pier was busy but nothing like Santa Monica or Venice Beach. Here it was quaint with nice restaurants and bars. You could watch people fishing, cyclists, and runners, a very active pier. Not as pricey as the beach areas north of the airport.",grubs

40,"After so many business appointments, it was nice to get a cup of coffee and gaze out!","Very nice. I was doing many business appointments and had a short break between and drove down to the ocean. It was a beautiful day so I had a cup of coffee and enjoyed a few minutes gazing at the Pacific! A very nice break from hotel room, driving on the freeway and meeting clients.",FundDude
50,"Sunshine, fresh air and and a beautiful view!","I have lived in the South Bay for over 65 years and I never miss a chance to visit the Redondo Beach Pier. While it has suffered in recent decades after a devastating fire in 1988, which resulted in the loss of many popular dining establishments, it is still a destination for me and my family. Whether to celebrate a birthday, holiday or just for an old fashioned walk at the beach the pier has become our place to go.",mike w
30,Quaint,Lovely walk around pier older and full of charm. Quaint shops and places to eat. Plenty of sea life and HUGE seagulls!,Allison V
50,Another of many gorgeous California beaches,"This is a happening place not far at all from DTLA. visiting our Tifanee & James and they lovegoing to Redondo so took us for a GORGEOUS sunset, full moon and dinner - walked and walkedso many restaurants to choose from........loved the views of Pacific and Mountains and oh that MOON",jeannette y
30,Ageing - But Still Nice,I walked down here for a look around and its a bit of a tired old pier but in a great location and on a nice day there are plenty of people around,Glen Bethel
30,Looked better from afar - needs a makeover,We rode our bikes to the pier then got out and walked around. I have to say i felt like it was very old and carnival like - they had a few cute shops but there was no healthy food to be found. It felt like it was really nice years ago but since it is a landmark there were alot of people there and when it lights up at night it does look pretty cool.,doroe24
30,Redondo Beach Pier,"The Pier at Redondo Beach seems like a good idea and photographs well, but in practice is not really very exciting. Not worth going out of your way unless you are here anyway or want to use it as a fishing platform. Can park underneath at $1.50 an hour and go for a walk round the loop. Seagulls watch you, sea lions honk from their resting places and there are lots of little silver fish glittering down in the sea. Fishermen are there, but so are lots of notices saying the fish are polluted so inedible along with local mussels. Supposed to be dolphins but they were absent during our visit. Lots of cheap food outlets, we had a nice crumbed fish, shrimp and chips for $12 or an expensive restaurant at far end of the car park that is nothing like as good as it thinks it is (we tried it once) Otherwise just good for a walk in the fresh air just to say you have been here.",JRNSydney_Australia
50,Great place to just hang out,"This pier has something for everyone - restaurants, kites, shopping, beach and ICE CREAM! Love to take my grandkids there.",VickiA63
40,Wonder how much change is going to happen soon?,I have walked the R.B. pier numerous times often after enjoying lunch OR dinner at The Chart House or Tony's On The Pier. They have plans of doing a major overhaul of the pier. It was destroyed some years ago from a vicious storm. It's presently a great pier....,sdrnek22
40,Great beach area,This is one of the last real California beach communities - beach area is really nice as are the restaurant around the area. Safe and easy to walk to from Redondo.,SCORPIOSFNM
40,Neat place to spent the day,Another great place to spend the day walking around people watching and enjoying great food. There are lots of little shops and restaurants to pop in and out of. Get here early as parking fills up fast. We will be back. Need to explore more of the food options available.,Jeep_guy_YYC
50,Beautiful area,Redondo Beach is one of the last holdouts of a great California beach community. Far less pretentious than ManhattanBeach And more friendly than Hermosa.A great throwback and fun place to be.,mfcMinneapolis
40,Really nice - even out of season,"We parked fairly early in the morning at Redondo Beach Pier and strolled along it just as everything was opening up. In early September it did have an ""out of season"" feel at that time. However come lunchtime when we returned from the beach, the restaurants were quite busy as were the shops selling tourist items. All very laid back and safe.",BobandJosie

30,Just stopped by for a quick drink with old friend,"Went by the pier for a quick drink with friend who has not been here for years. Very crowded on the weekend and it has gone down hill a bit. Of course the beach and ocean is nice. But honestly the south side of pier sometimes looks like a homeless camp with a lot of litter and just a general disrespect for the area.Safe from our perspective but wouldn't go if a women alone especially after dark , their is a police sub station on pier but police presence is minimum.",Michael S

40,A charming pier,"This is a charming pier with lots of restaurants, bars and souvenir shops. It offers great views of the beach and ocean. I enjoyed watching the pelicans fly and swim around.I also hung out on the beach. It was clean and not too crowded. Crashing around in the waves was fun.",Matt
30,Always nice for a walk around,"We live close by and often go for a walk on the Pier. Like the fisherman, pelicans. It is a small piece of nature in a busy urban area. Pretty good restaurants. Stores selling kitsch. Fun factory for the kids to play in. It is a fun outing for a day.",DFL
50,What a view!,"This Pier is full of fun and views! Take the whole family for a fun day. Lots of restaurants, farmers market on Thursdays and a great walk on the strand.",gkirma
50,Fun weekend activity,"If you love the ocean, just sitting and eating at one of the restaurants on the pier overlooking the beach and the ocean is fantastic on its own. For more action, you can rent a stand up paddle board (and get a free lesson at the start), or a kayak, or paddleboat. They even have group outings with stand up paddle boarding at night with LED lights under the boards so you can see the fish underneath you. The very large arcade is lots of fun with both new and old games -- Skeeball, full wall PacMan, etc. Something for everyone.",Joyce S
10,"If you love LOUD crowds, this is for you!","Our group of 5 went for a walk to see the sunset from the pier, and it was everything else except romantic! Low class, loud and obnoxious people and children EVERYWHERE, the smell of seafood cooking, either boiled of fried, was overpowering, no place to sit at a bar and enjoy a drink. I felt like having SOMETHING, so I ordered a funnel cake. After a long wait and $6 later, a small, hard and overly oily thing appeared, the worst one I ever tried, and all of us who tried it, regretted it later due to the grease coming back and heartburn. We were happy to return to the parking lot and get out of there!",FREQ_DINER10
50,Lovey place to visit,Would recommend a visit if visiting Redondo Beach some average shops for peoplelooking for presents to take home. Some fast food restaurants and a few seated restaurants a little of something for everybody. A lovely place for a stroll surrounded byby a harbour and a lovely beach.,RobertMac2017
50,Still the best pier ever,"It had been many years since we had been in Redondo, but I grew up here. We very much enjoyed our time on the pier! Lots of shops and eateries as well as beautiful views, a nice walk, and fishing as well.",Donna Y
30,Carnival on the pier,"It wasn't Venice Beach by any means, no street musicians, etc. Lots of bars, lots of restaurants and an arcade area. Not really my thing.",denise b
40,Be choosy when you choose to go,"The Redondo Beach area is one of the nicer destinations for a beach in the Los Angeles area. Having said that, its size and charm can work against itself when it is overrun with people. Go on a weeknight or a weekday better. When half of humanity comes down the parking spaces are overrun and the pier gourged with too many people, Rowdy or otherwise. There is an excellent place for fresh fish of all types and kinds, some of which is still alive when you pick it. The picnic style concrete tables they have for you works well when the place is not jammed. I cannot speak for how it would be when the place is filled to the brim.As to the pier itself I understand there's still good fishing to be had. So there is an authenticity to all the people dropping their lines at the edge of the pier. The pier is slightly worn, with nails slightly exposed, which adds to its charm.There is a pleasant scale to the area when it is not abused with people that exceed it's natural capacity.",MomoBobo
40,Lovely Sunset on the Pier,"Another interesting pier in Southern California. Absolutely charming sunset at the end of the pier.. Hundreds of fisherman catching fish, typical tourist shops, great food, reasonable parking. Win win for everyone",crazistevoh
10,This Pier Could Really Use a Face Lift!,We discouraged our family visiting from out of town from visiting the Pier area because it is dire need of repair and smells like rotting fish and urine. Really wish the residents had agreed to the redevelopment. What a missed opportunity. :(,cee2shiningcee
30,highs and lows,"Redondo beach pier has changed over the years in some respect, they have some trendier restaurants-R10 social house and they also have cool dive bars with craft beers, the problem is the crowd-people who get totally wasted and become violent. I don't feel safe as I've seen couple of fights break-out and now rarely go to the pier. It's unfortunate because the concert on the pier is a fun activity in the summer.",MsTravelBug1970

40,Interesting for sure.,Lots to see and if your into fried food this is definitely a spot for you! Almost all the food joints are sea food and there's a couple bars here and there. We were there at 9pm on a Saturday and the place was very lively with lots of people fishing on the pier and walking around.,j_cezar01
30,Not impressed.,The pier and shops and restaurant were your typical tourist traps!! I was not impressed except for the beautiful sunsets we watched from the end of the pier.,dixijewl

40,Great place to walk around on a beautiful sunny day.,"I love walking around the pier during the day light hours, looking at all the Pier has to offer. They have lots of quick eatery places or fine dining restaurants. You can have burgers, great steaks or fresh cooked delicious fish. It's all at your fingertips. I love to eat first, then walk off my dinner by walking and checking out everything else on the pier. There's shops and more shops, a lot of souvenir shops, ice cream shops and coffee shops. You can also watch the locals catch fish off the pier. It can be a complete fun day on the Pier and plenty of parking in the structure. Plan a day to go see the Redondo Beach Pier. Lots to see and do!",Surferjohnc
20,Needs improvement,"There are numerous reviews here that praise this pier's beautiful view of the ocean, upscale restaurants and pleasant atmosphere. These reviews definitely support the adage that perception is everything. The reviews extol the impressiveness of the Redondo Beach Pier and nothing could be farther from the truth. (In my opinion) The pier is in dire need of refurbishing as it is rundown and definitely shows its age. The last upgrade for the pier was completed over twenty years ago and many of the improvements over the years were due to severe storms and a large fire that demolished the pier. There are three seafood restaurants on the pier and the food at all three is very good. The pier itself is kind of dinghy looking and the parking area is not sufficient to accommodate weekend and sometimes evening parking. In the early evenings and weekends there is an element that frequents the pier that at times can be disruptive. If you dine at Kincaids, that restaurant is away from the busiest section of the pier and offers a totally different atmosphere.",AnthonyD1947
30,changed,"grew up here, so seeing the pier changed so much and commercialized was a downer, as usual pay parking everywhere, kinda dirty looking, not as clean as it was, more like a tourist trap, sad...",Fred V
40,Take the Walk,"The pier is like any other pier, a nice walk. If you like the ocean and views then be sure to walk the pier. There is a coffee shop and mini aquarium for a small donation at the end of the pier. The bathroom is not available. There are not to many places to sit however, the views are nice. My only dislike would be the shop and aquarium could use a face lift. It looks very shabby and unclean.",JadaLCofield

40,Something different.,"Santa Monica pier may get all of the glory in Los Angeles, but Redondo beach pier has a few diamonds in the rough. Quality seafood is the best place in ALL of LA for fresh seafood and they have the broadest selection.The Pier itself has a few cool bars, and you never have any issues parking. If you don't want the headache at the Santa Monica pier this is probably more your speed.",jeromer24

40,I visit the pier...,"...almost daily in the summer, and weekly in the winter. I live close by, so the pier is usually where I begin and end my beach walks.

It's a great place to catch a sunset in summer or enjoy the fog and marine layer in winter.",Julie S

50,Lovely place to stop and see the ocean and fisher-people!,Great pier with robust tourism activities. Especially impressed with all the seafood opportunities. Must be 5 different locations where you can get steamed seafood fresh while you wait. One location offered the biggest lobsters I have ever seen @ $25#. Lots of fishing occurring- very fun!,Thomas S
50,4th of July Weekend,Went to Redondo Beach Pier while visiting LA over 4th weekend. So many restaurants to choose from. More choices than Santa Monica and way less crowed. We ate at Tony's and did not have to wait more than 5 minutes to get in. Pier has metered parking at $1.50 an hour which is great compared to the $20 you pay at Santa Monica or Venice and beach is not crowded.,Karyn H

50,Great horseshoe pier - nice walk and a lot of cool bars and shops.,"Take a good long walk around the whole pier and harbour area: it's worth it. The amusements downstairs are great, nice and noisy, and the bars on the upper pier and excellent.",Andy W
20,Tacky tourist hole,If you you like kiss me quick tack and slot machines this will be up your street!There were a few restaurants selling lots of sea food such as crab & prawns that looked popular but also looked very low key joints with their plastic cutlery and paper plates.Was a shame as the pier itself was really nicely made and the only redeeming feature of Redondo for us were the sighting of 9 dolphins in the harbour.Other than them it would be one of the last places on earth I'd want to visit again!,D P
40,Cool place,"Great little pier, much nicer than Santa Monica pier and all the people.Really reminds me of an English seaside place only with better weather.Some good food places around and just a really nice vibe.",Gibbo1969
30,"Great location, somewhat entertaining","As far as piers go, the walk around this one will give you some great views and it's quite large. There were plenty of dining options, most of which seemed pretty well priced but the cleanliness was a bit of a concern. I imagine some of the actual restaurants are just fine but the little eateries along the pier were certainly suspect to me, they may have been just fine. We had multiple trips to the pier as we were riding our bikes up and down the bike paths in the area. Early morning, it's dead, just before lunch and well into the evening, it's lively and has plenty of shops and activities. It's worth going to, nothing over the top.",Jason C

10,Low rent area and smelly,"Was mis directed here but stayed for a look around. Plenty of things to see and places to eat, but the overwhelming smell of seafood was a bit off putting. A lot of lower end fast food places and bars. Not my style but if you like seafood and shellfish worth a visit.",Paul B
30,Nice view. Expensive food.,"Plenty of parking for a few dollars. Nice views here. Food here is SUPER EXPENSIVE. A lot of gross looking men drinking everywhere here. I would not recommend this pier for more than 2 hours if you have kids. The beach here is nice though. Super windy though. Manhattan beach is Far better, and just up the road a few miles.",freewaymaster
40,awesome place for fresh seafood!!!,this is an awesome place to go for some cheap seafood!!! just pick out your choices and have the vendors cook it for you! reserve a spot on one of the tables nearby( I recommend the 2nd floor) and wait for the food to get done! after eating one can then go around the pier and walk...watching the numerous folks fishing off the pier...it gets crowded yes but it's definitely worth the trip !!,Joe Alejo
40,Out of the way Pier eats,"First timer ordered bowl of lobster bisque, very generous serving to share with my husband. It is a order and pick up yourself restaurant. They have tanks of crabs and fish. In addition i ordered 1 lbs of grilled large shrimp, the Cole slaw is delish, dill is added gives it a great taste. My husband had fish and chips. Very fresh and good eats. You just wait your own table not a problem for us.",Eva9630
40,Long & interesting,"It's like a pier shaped as a V. Lots of fishermen, lots of pelicans. It's a fun place to go to escape the heat and breathe in the beautiful ocean air. There are restaurants, counters, and people selling touristy gadgets. It's a lovely place to sit and relax.",Nellie F
40,Nice place to people watch,I wanted somewhere interesting to spend the evening on a business trip. Great for people watching and had a wonderful king crab leg for dinner. Shopping was disappointing for me.,zoyapunk
40,Beautiful,I went with my family because we got a beach house nearby and it was really beautiful. The actually beach was really pretty and there was no visible trash. The pier seemed a bit old so that scared me a bit. They have a lot of fun tourist gifts and attractions. I bought the softest blanket ever there and I do not at all regret that purchase.,Zosen D
40,Lovely pier,"The pier is a mix of shops and restaurants with a nice mix of old wooden pier and new concrete pier (rebuilt after a storm destroyed much of it).

40,Seafood by the Pier!,"What I like about redondo beach, that the pier is quit big regarding HB and Santa Monica piers, there are many places where you eat seafood and crabs which are good and quite cheap. The beach itself is a lower class than HB and Santa Monica .They have a public parking which is $2/hour.",Hany G
30,"Crowds, noise and activities","Redondo Beach Pier is a lively, boisterous party atmosphere.

50,The most relaxing beach in the area.,"I have been to all the beaches in LA county and I have to say Redondo remains local, relaxing, and beautiful. Its so nice to be at a beach that isnt overcrowded with tourists. Even on the weekends, you'll find it much more calm then Santa Monica, Manhattan beach or Hermosa. There is a wide variety of food, and great places to grab drinks with friends without having to move your car. I have always been able to find parking here as well. The more south you go the more serene it gets. If you come here on a weekday, its all yours!",KnarikBrewster

20,Needs an update.,"The Redondo Beach Pier could use an update. It has an odd, 'relic' feel to it.There were several restaurants, mostly casual, with maybe one or two finer dining options. Many of the restaurants offered outdoor seating options.There was also an older arcade, with many broken game machines. The arcade crowd was mostly loiterers, and it wasnt exactly kid friendly.I wouldnt go out of my way to visit the pier.",mrsiss

40,Great Beach Pier,Redondo Beach Pier is a little more chill than most of the other really popular ones in SoCal like Santa Monica or Venice. This pier has all of the other necessary things though as the others such as the great food and deserts! I love the funnel cakes here and there is always something exciting going on here on the actual pier itself. Live entertainment sometimes depending on the timeframe that you are visiting. Keep in mind that the weekends are going to be one of the most busy times so having plenty patience with the crowds and finding parking is necessary! I enjoy every trip here!,BugattiBoi88
40,Nice and cool beaches! Jun 2013,"Certainly a surprise to me to see the beautiful rolling hills estates and the wonderful beach pier in this area!

40,Different... In a Cool Way!,"This pier and boardwalk area is different from the other beaches we visited in California. There's a small marina and a really cool fisherman's market with all sorts of sea creatures to eat. You can purchase seafood by the pound to take home or they'll steam, grill or fry it for you to eat there. The eating area is outdoor and cafeteria style but it does face the marina and there are strolling musicians. There's an arcade for kids with a tilt a whirl. There are also a few other restaurants, bars and small gift shops. The beach area is separated a bit from the pier restaurants and shops. There is also a boardwalk for walks. In general, this beach is not as upscale as the other ones we visited, but the fisherman's market makes it interesting and unique.",Hillary160

40,Take A Stroll On The Pier,"Neat layout for a pier, it's in a big semi circle with lots of little shops and restaurants on multiple levels, my girls are very much addicted to the (pearls in the oyster) places, there are 2 of them close to each other and not terribly expensive, they crack the oysters open after you pick out the one you want (had the most luck picking out the most ugly shell they could find) both my girls got black ones, the wife got a very pretty bluish green that the people had never seen the likes of, so they said. you might see seals, people catching mackrel and such, one day there were these big birds sitting on the roofs that had bright red eyes, they looked evil LOL, it makes for a nice relaxing fun day.",robino154
40,Fun place adjacent to redondo beach,You can see some people fishing when the sun shines. Nice restaurants serving local food. Ice cream shops. This would also be a starting point for whale watching tours. Nicely decorated and colorful place.Some shops also display live crabs. Poor crabbies 😣,Virag S
50,Amazing beach and bars,We were on a business trip and had an afternoon to kill. This is the pier seen on many TV shows as it's absolutely beautiful scenery. Bars down the Main Street offer everything you could ever want! Huge beach and amazing sand to relax.,Mike E

40,Nice & touristy,"There are a few shops & bars, loads of people fishing & a fish cleaning station and restaurants where you can choose your own lobster, crab or fish from those squashed tightly into the tanks underneath the windowsills if you don't want to catch your own. If that's still not for you, you can just wander along & people watch. 🦑🦀🦂🦐🎣",Sarah E
50,Spring is like Summer,A spring day is like summer at the RB pier. Grab a hot dog on a stick and lemonade and then head on over for fresh made churros at the pier bakery. Fewer crowds and distractions make for a pleasant stroll and terrific views of Palos Verdes. Parking is free on Catalina or the Esplanade streets and of course there is also inexpensive paid parking in the structure attached to the pier.,BoboTravlr
30,A little old...,"Redondo beach is a nice place, far away from the crowds of other LA beaches, however this Pier is a little bit old, even their stores and restauarants. Good for a walk, but if you are not nearby it do not worth the travel.",brucemsn

There is an awesome fresh churro maker. There's plenty of parking for low or no-cost. You can always see people fishing and just strolling the pier.,Laurie W
50,Home away from Home,"I come to Redondo Beach pier any chance I get. It is filled with so much to do and 2 of my favorite restaurants, El Torino and Tonys on the pier. I heard they will be remodeling the pier in the future. Rumor has it that it will be so much larger and may even have a small amusement park like Santa Monica. I learned to surf from Dewey Weber who has passed away years ago. The beach is my serenity. The pier has easy access underground parking. Great place for anyone. The gift shops are filled with treasures from the sea. My favorite is the Mermaid gift shop as I love mermaids. Go and enjoy. They have rentals so you can surf, body boarding etc.",Jodee68
50,GREAT TIME,wonderful place to go and get away from the busy city and relax great food and beautiful sunsets and arcade for the kids,John L
40,Great pier with restaurants and perfect for sunset views,"The pier is a great spot for sunset views and a leisurely walk to take in the sea breeze. Redondo Pier is multi-levelled. It has many restaurants (of course, mainly seafood), cafes, pubs and bars. Plus gift and trinket stores. A great view out to sea.The Pier arcs out over the beach, so look backwards to watch the waves break on shore and at disk see the lights of the restaurants. Look seaward for a perfect view of the setting sun.Tip: T's a great local seafood hangout underneath the main pier. Paper table cloths, on big concrete tables and chairs, great micro-brewed craft beers, fresh cooked lobster, an array of other seafood and our favourite - clam chowder in a sour-dough bread bowl. All at reasonable prices.Combine it with a walk to Hermosa Beach pier, restaurants and pubs (although you will need to walk passed a big power plant, but it doesn't billow smoke, its just unsightly). The beach esplanade is worth the effort.A nice, pleasant afternoon or morning or mid-day out.Go try it.",JGSingers
40,I had more fun than I though I would!!!,"I have been Hermosa Pier. I have been to Manhattan Beach Pier. I have been to Santa Monica Pier. Thinking the Redondo Beach Pier would be very much the same, but I was wrong. Took my parents to visit the Pier thinking we would be there for an hour, and ended up staying the afternoon. We parked in the metered parking deck. The first half was typical Pier- lovely views of the beach, restaurants, tourist shops. Delicious fresh churros. We kept walking and ended up at the marina -- with MORE shops, fresh fish shops and arcade, Water sport rentals and a glass bottom boat tour of the harbor. Overall it's a little run down, it could use a sprucing and some fresh paint but the beautiful day did make it a more pleasant visit. A great place to bring out of town visitors on the cheap!",L P
30,Nice walk,A few souvenir shops with over priced item but it is expected. A few good restaurants are onsite. Lots of opportunities for fish and seafood lovers,WombatBen

50,Expansive pier with tons of food and shopping,"Have been to many piers in my life, but nothing like this. You can walk forever. Many great shops and restaurants.

40,"Ocean is gorgeous, delicious food choices, good walkways, small shops, little amusment park","Redondo Beach Pier great date area, and family area. The only problem is parking. you have to pay when you arrive, now and they charge you more to add parking fees to the app. Variety of eating places, from stand eat outside to sit down romantic dining. Beach for swimming, small amusement arcade, little shops of trinkets. fun!",magolden200
50,Relaxing,"We went to the Pier to watch the sunset. There are plenty of places to eat and shop also. Parking is reasonably priced and located in an underground garage. You park. Pay with your credit card at a kiosk and choose the amount of time you want to pay for. If you give them your phone number, you'll get a text telling you time is almost up and it will allow you to add additional time from your phone for the hourly rate plus a 25 cent service fee.Since we were there to watch the sunset, we just strolled along the pier stopping to look from different locations. People were fishing off of the pier and seagulls and pelicans were all over waiting for a treat. They were quite docile and up close. We had an enjoyable experience and would love to do it again.",Pittakos

40,Very Beautiful Location. Places to eat.,"There are a number of places to eat there that are nice. Pier is a little run down, but its a pier on water. I have found a number of places to eat and drink and hang with the boats, that are fun. Funky, but not not over built and easy to park and walk around. The location is wonderful and when I take photos and put them on facebook everyone just loves it. They have Friday Cars Shows in the Summer next to the pier and just a nice place to be. Very easy going. This is very different then San Pedro or Long Beach. Less commercial and less crowed and built on a beach with fantastic views.",Alan S Torrance

30,People Watch,"We go to the pier a lot to get out of the house, people watch and see what the folks fishing off the pier are bringing up. Every so often we will visit the stores or restaurants along the waters edge. Did just find out that the pier is undergoing plans for renovation. It will be sad to see the old one go but the new plans will have much more thing to do for the tourists.If you are down at the pier I suggest renting bikes and going down the strand. Lots of shops and nice beaches between piers, not to mention the social aspect of it. Can spend a day easily doing this.Have fun.",Karrrbear
40,Enjoy a beautiful day at the pier,"Spend a day at this pier. Lots to do for all ages. Walk, ride a bike, sit and relax to watch swimmers and fishermen.

50,"The Strand is great for running, biking and shopping.",Good seafood options available. Lots of shops and entertainment. No bikes allowed on the pier BTW. Great during and after sunset.,MRRShore
50,Coolest pier,"Im not sure you can call this a pier as it is so cool i think it deserves more credit! We went on a misty wet evening, which barely even mattered since the urge to see more of this cool walk outweighed the cold. You can entertain everyone here. Cool retail stores if you want a souvenir or need a sweater. An arcade that has so many old school games we gor caught up for over an hour. There is also so many restaurants you can choose your cuisine. Obviously the fresh fish was the main focus and you can buy and have cooked before your eyes delicious seafood and sit where you can see the boat docks. It was somewhat dead when we cane but i expect this place is hopping in good weather/ another season. We will definitely be back when things are more lively and the weather is better.",Thedriveagain

Sometimes there's live music too.,Luc1952

Great parking (which was FREE for December (not always FREE).Looks like they had some decent seafood restaurants there but I went between Breakfast and Lunch so I wasn't hungry and most were not open. Interesting place to take a family and get out to see the Ocean. T-shirts, souvenirs, and ""California knick-knacks"" were on sale.Definitely a good family place to stop at.",PROF_CONSULTANT

50,Fun shops and places to eat,We went down late in the evening to grab a souvenir for one of our girls. We ended up walking around the pier and the other shops. It was cool to see all the little cafes you can get fresh seafood. We didn't partake because we just ate and it was late. Next time we're down in Cali we are going to eat all the seafood we can. All the boats were docked right there and we could hear seals in the distance. It was so beautiful there that night. They also had a large arcade but we didn't play as we were on a mission for souvenirs before closing time.,hrdlcrw

There are several places were enjoying social moments, buying souvenirs or, if weather allows, get everything you need to enjoy the ocean side and swim! Space for kids available, with video games and more. Good spot for sunset and fishing just after the sun said good bye. Parking available, not expensive.

50,One of my favorite spots,"I love this pier. Tony's on the Pier is great for a sunset margarita, fresh seafood for sale, pick your own pearl, boat excursions, arcade, live music, you name it- you can probably find it here. It is a wonder place to walk around and admire the ocean. Sunset is my favorite time to be down here, but anytime is a good time.

50,Good Place to Watch the Sunset,"Just like most pier in California, this one is fun to visit, eat, people-watch, and watch the sunset...which I did all of the above when I went.I enjoy solo traveling and really enjoyed people watching and didn't feel 'alone' or awkward. There are plenty of shops to go to and the fresh seafood restaurant choices are plentiful.I ate at Quality Seafood, Inc. and was a little bit disappointed. First of all, the person behind the counter was rude and gave me conflicting information in terms of how they prepare and clean the fish compared to what the cashier told me. The man acted as if I was bothering him for asking him to clean-up and cook the seafood I had ordered from this joint. Then they overcooked/overfried my fish and my calamari and there was no seasoning at all. I should have walked a little bit further and gone to Captain Kidds Fish Market instead, which was the place that was recommended to me by one of my girlfriends who went there recently. I'll make sure not to buy my seafood and eat at this Quality Seafood, Inc. again. I've been in Customer Service industry for over 18 years and I've always treated my customers happily with a smile. Not once in my work history have I treated a customer as if they were a nuissance.At the end of my meal, I walked-off all that seafood that I ate and watched the sunset. As always, the sunset was gorgeous and loved the silhouette of the pier lights and the people fishing. I was so bummed that my phone battery died and was unable to take photos *sigh*.",Flamenquera
40,"Great place to walk, shop, nosh and enjoy the ocean views","We spent a weekday afternoon walking on the Redondo Beach Pier. While it wasn't packed with tourists, it still had a large selection of arcades and shops as well as all kinds of snacks for sale.

40,GREAT MORNING,"The one place I always look forward to when I visit California is Redondo Beach. The people are for the most part friendly and the place is as clean as it can be with all the people that hang out there. I parked close to the Strand & walked around for about 45 minutes just taking in all the sights and smells. I have never seen anyone catch any fish from the pier but someone must catch fish as there is always people fishing there. The Strand is awesome for people watching as there is always a wide selection of ""different"" people out there (some are further out there than most too). I feel safe in that area as well as I traveled alone this time. The fish market near by was quite interesting price wise. I was shocked at the prices for king crab ($47 a pound see photos). Needless to say I did not buy any sea food there. Lots of shops in the area and little eateries and even a Starbucks. Parking is not free anywhere and it is also not cheap. I was lucky I happened to have a bunch of quarters in my pocket too. This is a must see if you are in the area.",mikefred

Lovely fresh fish of every kind.I have been told that they are pulling the pier down next year & building a new one, let's hope that they can keep the atmosphere that the original one has with all of the little shops & restaurants.",Geraldinecybil
20,Tired and falling apart,"I first visited Redondo Beach Pier in 2001, then it was just the pier with a few concessions and a restaurant. Much has changed since then and not for the better.It is overcrowded with tacky shops and and an office complex which overshadows the entire pier. The car park looks to be in very bad shape with concrete falling away from the rebar. When compared to the other piers along the coast, well really, there is no comparison.You either leave things alone or at the very least make them better, Redondo has done neither and, in my opinion, has suffered by poor planning",Dobeadoo
30,We got engaged on Redondo Beach Pier,This pier has always had sentimental value for our family. We were engaged here and would bring our children here often. Our last visit was on our 31st anniversary this year. I was slightly disappointed in the condition of businesses here.,Hairup
50,Gorgeous,I love the water so this place was right up my alley on the beautiful Pacific Ocean! I went during the week so there wasn't a lot of foot traffic but it was clean and just beautiful! Parking was easy. I can't say enough this is going to be my go-to spot every time I come to Southern California!,480arlenes

50,Redondo Pier has a international favor,"Since I live near by, I'm a make use of the Pier often, do my early morning walks, or a midday stroll, love the evening breezes and sunsets ofcourse. What is always exciting is the energy at the pier from varied folks fishing, to just visiting, an there are quite a few shops that have nice items to buy for oneself or as a local gift. Must not forget the Fish Market that's on the ground level, it's quite a festive scene on those holidays and weekend. I love the fact that you can request your lobster cooked and enjoy it there on site, there is also, crab, clams and various other sea type to choose.",Longlegponi
50,Beautiful fun!,As a family with teenagers and younger kids we walked the pier and shopped the shops and had seafood in a gorgeous setting. I highly suggest the fish market restaurant and for sure a souvenir from the little shops. It was fun to play in the ocean and watch the locals skateboarding and listen to the waves crash. Parking was easy and seeing the fisherman cast right off the pier was great!,Stephaniest3
50,Beautiful view.,My daughter & I started out in Redondo Beach and we stroll all the way to the Pier. We walked and ate at the pier and we took a Uber back to the hotel. Had a fantastic time.,ritz1991
40,Eating and fishing from,Brunch at El Torito was a nice experience and was at a reasonable amount for the atmosphere. Also fished off the pier which is clean and well kept. A great place to visit!,Steve Y
30,Great Scenery But Could Use An Update,Every time my wife and I are in Redondo Beach for a few days we always end up walking down to the pier. The past few times we have found ourselves making the same comment. This place needs a revamp and reinvigorated. I can remember when there was music playing from some of the bars and there were always a lot of people. On this trip there was hardly anyone there and it was the week before Labor Day weekend. The places we used to stop and have a drink at were closed. I guess there are good times to be had for kids and the souvenir shops are always good to browse but the excitement needs to be brought back.,Barry B
20,Needs a makeover!,The newer section of the pier is nice but the older parts and the lower section are very dated and in need of repair and updating! I believe it's in the works for the waterfront to be revamped and it really needs it. This real estate is too pricey to be in this poor of shape. The restrooms were atrocious! Looking forward to some progress on the remodel!,janad63
40,One of the most active piers on the SoCal coast,"Neat pier connected to the marina with lots of strolling areas, restaurants, both fancy and walk up, curio shops, paddle boat rentals. Watch the fishers lining the south rails. Saw a number of catches. Just a good fun place.",Bill H
40,"Good selection of restaurants, a few activities, nice place to spend a day","We've been going to this pier for 25+ years. If you really think about it, southern California does not have a lot of piers like this (Santa Monica Pier has an amusement park on it but rest of it is pretty limited, Santa Barbara's Stern Wharf is nice but smaller.)You have a variety of restaurant options from $ to $$$. One of our favorite restaurants, Pacific Fish Center, is located here. The oyster bar/fish market on the ground level is also quite the experience as you can try 20+ oyster varieties (you can buy them one at a time).In terms of activities, there is fishing, paddle boating, some sightseeing boat tours, an arcade (with one spin, whirl ride and some carnival games). It is also next to a very family friendly beach with usually pretty small waves.Parking can sometimes be tough as the garage tends to fill up, especially on Holidays but if you are patient, you can always find a spot.",hoonieskang
50,Childhood memory's,This will always be a favorite spot and will always be close to my heart. I have been to many piers this is by far the best.,Kathleen H
40,"Touristy for sure, but a nice walk","I was staying near the pier and decided to take a walk and see what there was to see. There are a variety of restaurants and bars, small retail shops that offer everything from pearl jewelry to souvenirs, and a shop where you can rent pedal boats, paddleboards, or book boat excursions. There are also a few places where you can buy fresh seafood by the pound, or get it cooked to order. I didn't eat anywhere but food smelled good. It was Sunday of Labor Day weekend, so it was crowded, but there was live music on the pier and loads of families, couples, etc. I went past the pier further south to the public beach there and it was very nice, with a long sidewalk along the top of the beach with bike lanes.",WriterGirlCleveland

The Redondo Pier did not disappoint with multiple shops to browse and lots of eateries for a quick bite. Best part was the beautiful California sunset we saw and that the kids got to stretch their legs and enjoy the fresh air! Plenty of restaurants at the pier with great views.

40,"Good, but can be better","Went to Redondo Beach Pier on a Saturday at 11am. The pier was relatively quiet. Since it has been a while since I've been here, I noticed a few new restaurants with Korean writing on the signs, particularly the shops that sold crab. A few restaurant spaces were empty, but I noticed new signage on a couple fast food places. Had a fish plate, clam chowder, and my son had a corn dog plate, the food was hot and tasty. None of the souvenir shops interested us.My five year old son was interested in seeing all the fishing on the pier. Temps were in the low 70's, so it was a nice day to fish. Parking and pier were adjacent to the beach, so the location is convenient. Public restrooms by the parking lot were dirty. There is a bike path that passes through the pier and along the beach. Parking is $2 an hour, which I thought was a good deal. Also, there are plenty of covered spaces.It seems like the pier has seen better days, but I like that it is quieter than the touristy beaches of Santa Monica and Venice.",GiantsFanLosAngeles

Sometimes in the summer months they have concerts on Thursday evening and Saturday afternoon. Get a coffee or ice cream or gelato and enjoy. You don't have to spend any money if you don't want to. Some of the restaurants have happy hour at 3 or 3:30. Pretty sunsets. I like to watch the fisherman.,R0ckettWriter

40,Great seafood,"This Pier is small but it is much classier than most that you see and not as crowded. Because it is smaller there is not as much to do as, say, Santa Monica, but it is much classier.

The beach is beautiful and the sand doesn't stick on you as it does here in Galveston as I am from Houston Texas. Keep in mind the water is very very cold compared to TX beaches, and there is a lot of seaweed and kelp that washes up, but overall it was very nice.",piscesdiva30

There are nice views, cruise tours, fishing, lots of restaurants and bars and seafood market over there and as a destination with lots of people, the price is also a bit more pricey compare than local area and it totally worthy it. Imagine just take a walk with your pet or friend and family or fishing in the afternoon by yourself. you are embracing the great scene and atmosphere with winds, besides a brunch of choices for dining options, fresh seafood, they also got live brands at the bar at night time so basically you are welcome to visit at anytime and you could discover this place in different way of beauty. One more thing there is public parking and you have to pay before you leave the parking and walking down the pier, so calculate the time before you set off then you don't need to go back and forward.",Elle Lao
40,Farmers Market,"The Farmers Market occurs here every Thursday at the Veterans Park right next door to the pier. Booths have a lot of variety, the most popular items are the snow cones, cakes/pies, fresh seafood, popcorn, and honey sticks (each for only 25 cents!). When you are through shopping you can enjoy your food at a picnic table overlooking the ocean or by the playground to watch your kids run out their energy!If you want to explore more, the pier offers fun for all ages. Go chat with a fisherman, play in the arcade, shop to your hearts desire or enjoy a cocktail at Tony's on the Pier (order a drink with a souvenir glass!).

Quite a cute little place for a quick stroll.",193moniquecs
50,Lots to do great place,"We really like this place because there is lots to do. It's a great place to take a walk, whether on the beach or pier. The pier has lots of shops and activities everything from fishing to getting prescription glasses. They have glass bottom boats for only $10.00 per adult or less per child you can rent kayaks, pedal boats, stand up paddleboards. They were lots of people fishing and catching (mackerel) mostly, some 4 or 5 at a time. Everyone was having fun and even on Friday June 25th (we got there at noon) and I didn't feel to crowded. That was the pier, the beach was a little more crowded but still enjoyable. Lots of people sunbathing and playing in the ocean just enjoying the day (mid-70s). The pier and surrounding beach communities offered local fish restaurants and markets with same day catch and other fresh fish cooked to order or takeout for cooking on beach. We chose Captain Kidd's fish market and restaurant. Review coming :). This was a great day and spent around $70 or $80 dollars for 2 at a restaurant , ice cream and other activities way less than the big crowded amusement parks parking can be tuff if you can park on PCH and walk a block or two.",Eileen S

40,Old Fashioned Pier We're Still Fighting For,"Easy, laid back pier. Currently there's a fight with a developer (CenterCal) that seeks to transform the pier into a high end shopping center with highly designed walkways that offer views between corridors.Currently, it features restaurants such as Tony's, Kincaids, Barny's Beanery, and El Torito, as well as a number of smaller and fast food choices. It's simple, not glamorous, some small shops, many fishermen, lots of Pelicans and Seagulls.Crowded on weekends and hot days, mostly with families. I live in the area and take walks here daily. It's an old pier with a lot of history but it's not a gentrified experience. If you're seeking that, probably Laguna Beach would suit you better.",lorriek260
50,Always a crowd pleaser,The redondo beach pier while dated is always a fun place to visit and enjoy the seashore. You might be tempted to overlook old standbys like Tony's or Hot Dog on a Stick but don't because you'll miss out on a great dining experience.

40,Nostalgic /Class Reunion,I grew up in the South Bay and would ride my bicycle often to the beach and the bikepaths of the beaches. So much has changed!

Compared to Dana Point Wharf and Balboa Village in Newport, which are comparatively upscale, the Redondo Beach Pier is where you can experience the vibrant pulse of a diverse urban community sharing the sun, sea and surf.The overall design of the Redondo Beach Pier complex is well thought out. A parking structure sits underneath a series of shops and offices that connects two piers that jut out into the surf. The ends of the piers are connected with a boardwalk - perfect for couples and families taking a casual stroll.",tjcnewyork

Some places looked abandoned and there were hardly anyone around. Couple of stores were open, 3-4 but that was it. Not worth the stop or time there.",K2service

It has a nice mix of coffee shops, bars, restaurants, arcades and other places to eat and relax at. it has food from fancy (Kincaids) to cheap diner style places which makes for food for any type of budget. There are tourists and locals which is always a good mix. The best thing to do here is simply enjoy the view, enjoy a drink, and watch the waves.",Brix510
40,I miss the old Redondo Pier,"I grew up in the South Bay & during the summer went to the beach regularly & loved going to the pier. Old wood walkway that you could see the ocean underneath the open fish market as you walked onto the pier not over by the nasty looking boat slips as it is now. It was ""fancied up"" many years ago but is becoming shabby & trashy. Nothing will stop me from going to the beach but I can bypass the Redondo pier & not miss a thing",ConnieL1950
40,Interesting restaurants smells of fish,Some interesting restaurants some high end and some mom and pop seafood snack bars. When walking the pier be careful of all the fishers. They don't watch where they swing their poles. International Boardwalk area smells of the fish stands.,ScottC4746

40,Get a peddle boat out to see the sealions,Have been to the Pier often on past visits and wanted to go thistime to see it before any major changes. I hope they wont take away the quirky character of the Pier when the do refurbs. Took my grad daugters out on a single peddle boat and it was worth every penny to see the sea lions on their island.,Minamon
50,Awesome,Great place to visit. The pier is interesting as you can get up and close to the brown pelicans. You can watch fisherman catching local fish. You have a good choice of shops and eateries. Walk along the whole pier and it's such a pleasant walk. There is a fish market there with lots of choice of food. Plenty of parking close by where you pay up front for as much as you need but can also top up times direct from your phone if needed.,Catherine G

50,Iconic destination,"I've lived within a couple of miles of the pier all my life and seen it go through many changes. If you're in the Redondo, Torrance, Manhattan Beach, Hermosa Beach area, you must visit the pier. There are lots of great restaurants, lots of fresh fish markets and tourist shops. Not to mention the fishing you can do at the end and around the pier. The best is the beach and the views. Highly recommend a visit.",Renae T
50,Great area to walk,We enjoyed waking around here. The beach nearby was too cold to get in the water but was pretty. There were plenty of cute little shops and places to eat and drink. We meant to come back but didn't. We will definitely visit again!,CrystalAnn
40,Great outdoor amenity.,I love visiting my friend in Redondo Beach and spending our mornings walking down by the beach. We often walk to the pier and back and enjoy the sea air and watching the surfers.,Lisa M
50,Nice area!,It was a coolish January day but certainly warmer than what I'm used to in Jan. My friends and I were able to sink our feet into the sand and get a little wet. The beach is clean and the area is nice. It was my first time seeing the Pacific Ocean from the ground. It was cleaner than the Atlantic it seemed. Can't wait to go back when it's warm enough to enjoy.,Beccah0206

40,Dated - needs a face lift,There is a nice view from the pier up and down the coast. There are some good restaurants and bars on and around the pier with lots of good seafood. There is a pretty big arcade downstairs that's great for kids. My wife and daughter love to walk around it and watch the birds and fishermen and the boats coming in and out of King Harbor. Lots of nice souvenir shops - I like the whirly-gig shop! Lots of colorful options to chose from that will look good in the yard! There always seems to be plenty of parking and it costs a little to park - and they often have free parking during holidays.,Dano
30,What you would expect - on a cool windy January day,"Had a slightly out-of season feel to the place, but I suppose that is to be expected in January. From personal experience presents much better when the sun is shining.",BobandJosie

40,Nice Place to Visit in So Cal,Lots of shops and restaurants of various kinds connected by a pier and boardwalk. Apparently a favorite spot for fishing as well. There is a nice wide sandy beach adjacent to the pier and the parking garage rates are very reasonable. I went in January 2016 and only paid 50 cents to park for an hour! That's dirt cheap in So Cal.,Granddad Green Go
50,Come hungry !,My wife and I visited over the Christmas holiday and we're shocked at all the people out enjoying the weather and beach . But the most important part was the fresh seafood there are a few stalls that let you pick your crabs or lobsters along with fresh oysters . Then they will steam it for you and all you do is grab an empty table and enjoy . As you walk along the pier stop in at Najas and have a beer they have like over 70 on tap and the day we went a live reggae band . They day could not have been better.,Ken R
50,Beautiful sunny Ca.,"Incredible location. Beautiful view to the north of Santa Monica all the way up the coast to Malibu. Southern view of PV looks like the Mediterranean coast.

30,Off season visit,"Typical food and souvenirs. Great classic arcade, plenty of food options and a few kitschy shops to boot.",Tom M
50,The pier and beach are lovely.,"Redondo beach and pier are both worth a visit. Nice quiet beach, with a small shady park over looking the bay which was perfect for a picnic minus the sand, and had a lot of what looked like local families enjoying their weekend, camped out under the trees. There were flocks of bright green parakeets in the trees and down on the beach we watched huge in-elegant pelicans catching fish, which was incredible to watch.The pier its self is your average seaside fare with shops and restaurants, with a nice walk and viewing area so you can sit and watch the boats come in. Nice public artwork of local marine life dotted about too.Great if you want somewhere that isn't too crazy/touristy, but still want to feel like you're on holiday!",Isla R
40,Great for Date Night!!!,The benches on the pier are plentiful and great for gazing at the stars and watching the waves. It is one my favorite places to just sit and chat for hours. There are also sufficient options for dining or just grabbing a quick snack.,jamesmcfarland2015
40,"Redondo Beach Pier, worth checking out !","While visiting my sister in Redondo Beach , we stopped by the pier for lunch. Cool shops with unusual beach theme gifts, shirts, glassware etc.A few good restaurants, great place to stop for lunch. The beach is really clean, note no dogs allowed on their beach. It looked like people were having a good time catching fish on the pier too.",vacationcindy2222
40,An ocean-side stroll,"We stopped by the pier because I wanted to stretch my legs and take a look. Being from the middle of the country, I haven't seen much of the Pacific so I'm curious as to what's there. This was a great place to stroll and look at the ocean, a few seagulls, a pelican or two, and people watch. I was amazed by the seafood markets with very fresh and large selections. I hope to get back and check out one of the restaurants and have some of these sea creatures prepared for me.",Joe_Cool68510
50,My back yard,"I live close to here and I always love having a walk around. There are Pelicans strutting around amongst the fishermen and pedestrians. They seem to enjoy having their photos taken. Restaurants for all budgets from El Torrito to Kincaids(the best). Downstairs there is a lively boardwalk with lots of boats, casual family fish restaurants.Busy on weekends but don't let that discourage as there is room for all.",jenniferCalifornia
40,Sunset walk,After dinner at Kinkaids I had a walk along the pier. The sunset was awesome. Lots of activities in the area: definitively worth a visit,Thor Anders A
50,Watch the Sunset,"This is a lovely place to walk. It is well maintained and offers fabulous views of the ocean, beach and palm trees. There is a convenient parking lot. With bike lanes , it is easy for everyone to walk or bike. The pier has a unique design. There are many shops and restaurants. There were families fishing. It is definitely worthwhile to stop here.",travelingrm
40,Beautiful morning strolling the pier,"Being a Saturday morning the walk along the pier was fascinating and with beautiful views of the ocean. Lots of shops, restaurants, and things to do.",James H
40,Great place to while away an hour or two,"During our first visit to LA, we tried to get to Redondo Beach via the metro but please be warned, even though there is a metro stop called 'Redondo Beach' it is NOT near Redondo Beach! There is a bus stop nearby with buses that go to the beach, but the next bus wasn't due for an hour so we decided to walk. Somewhere along the way we took a wrong turn, but no matter as we ended up at Manhattan beach, so spent the morning their instead.A couple of weeks later, while in LA again we made our our second trip to Redondo Beach which was much more successful as we drove there. November is clearly off season but there was a farmers market for locals we strolled round before making our way to the pier. It's a little jaded, but has a certain charm and we spent a couple of hours watching the wildlife, sitting in the sun and wandering around the quaint shops. You have the feeling of 'stepping back in time' there - it's sleepy and gentile and a great place to spend a couple of hours.The Pier and area around is about to undergo a multi-million $ refurbishment so it will be interesting to see what happens.There are car parks very near by of if you don't mind a 10 minute walk along the beach front path, there's free on street parking.",Cerris1
40,Redondo Beach Pier,The beach is clean and no litter. The beach is raked daily and not over crowded. They have cute little shops nearby and good restaurants but a bit pricey.,Jane05661
30,Decent well-kept public pier. The secrets are under it where the fish market hides.,One of the better pier arrangements in Southern California. Plenty of dining and ocean activities to entertain. Lots of boat tours and just sight looking is enjoyable. visit the public areas above the park where some of the memorials are worthy of a look-see. Plan on a few hours and buy some sea foods to take home. Fresh and reasonably priced. Walk around awhile before you buy and bring an ice chest to keep it cold on the trip home. Do lunch on the pier too. Sunscreen needed!,Bobb L
50,Great views.,Love the walk and the beach of this peer. You actually feel like you're right there along amongst the surfers.,mack0168
50,Perfect for night photography,"I have been to this pier many times for birthday occassion, seafood market and night photography. Also had pier fishing and sunset view to capture the sun set at the horizon. Parking is very convenient with handicap access",butchrey
50,Beautiful views,Great place to watch the sunset and grab some fresh seafood. There is a stand up paddle board place on the pier I really want to try next time. A place called Jade Snow that has the best shave ice ever with fresh fruit. Plenty of parking too and the machine can text you when your time is low.,Guide495115
40,Beautiful Sunset!,"If you like seafood and small shops, this is the place to be. Most of the restaurant have a gorgeous view of the beach. The pelican's are huge and there are a variety of birds that fly by. People would actually fish on the pier and the sunset is absolutely beautiful. Parking is a bit tough if you want free parking. You might have to park blocks away and walk to the Redondo Beach Pier.",Xoxo
40,Pleasant stroll,"Plenty of fishermen were busy as dusk fell. It was a pleasant stroll around the pier, though frankly, we were not atteacted much by the low-grade looking outlets, both food and trinkets",DavidG897
40,Longest pier in town!,"The Redondo Beach Pier is one of the longest piers I've been on. It doesn't just go straight out into the ocean but semi-circles out and around. The pier if very clean too. Some parts are for fishing but most folks seem to be out there for the fresh air, shopping, restaurants & bars. Because it is cement, it is easy for walkers, strollers and wheel chairs vs. the wood slat piers.There is a multi-level parking garage there, which I don't recall how much it cost. Likely there is validation for shopping or dining at one of their businesses. Restaurants range from reasonable to expensive. My favorite is on the lower level by the marina where you pick your own shell fish and they steam or cook it to order right there. I take my Mom when she is in town because she can get her oysters on the half shell and I get my steamed soft shell clams from the east coast.Other attractions from there is a harbor tour and a speed boat ride.",lkstumm
40,Redondo Beach Pier,This Pier is situated at the Northern End of Redondo Beach. The view from the Pier is excellent. There are many Restaurants offering variety of Sea Food. Many people set up Fishing Rods to catch fish,Sunilvk64

40,Very slow and half the size when I was here as a kid,I grew up near by and it was much better before the fire took out half of the pier. I still loved to watch the fishermen on the pier.,NitroDog
30,Not bad,Visited in October 2015 - not bad. Nice pier with several restaurants and shops. We visited during a week night and it was very quiet.,Michelle D
40,"Good place to find something to eat, drink, buy etc.","After a few hours on the beach, this is just the place to retire to for a wander around looking at the shops and maybe settling down for a snack and a drink.Late September - even though the weather was very hot it had an ""end of season"" feel to it. Some items are a bit pricey for what they are.",BobandJosie
50,Lots to do!,"It is a great place to spend the day or evening. Lots of opportunity to rent boards, paddle boats, or go for a boat ride. Lots of food offerings. Many places to fish and enjoy the water.",sherryelmo

30,Beautiful views,"Visited here today and had a lovely time strolling up and down the pier, taking in the sites and enjoying the breeze. Lots of cute shops to see and a variety of eating establishments. Be sure to bring quarters to feed the meter as the businesses are reluctant to give change.",Crystal L
40,It's a beautiful pier. So go already!,"Yes it's a pier. If you've been on one, and so on. To me each pier is a pleasure to be on. It reminds me of my childhood, fishing with my dad in Florida. Yes it smells like the sea and fish at times. I could stand there all day and enjoy the waves braking against it. When your tired of the sounds, wind and smells just walk a little bit and enjoy some food and drink nearby at one of the wonderful establishments. It's a great experience you shouldn't miss.",AJVaughnDOTcom
50,Never a Dull Moment!!,"There is always something to do there. You have ice cream, attractions, arcade, rides, paddle boats for the kids. Bars, restaurants, romantic restaurants, whale watching, gondola rides, sail boat rides, stand up paddle boards, dive bars, fancy restaurants, not so fancy restaurants, the in between restaurants, restaurant row, with over 13 restaurants to choose from, even 3 different fish markets to choose from, one very clean, and two that, you will get dirty there. Souvenir shops, etc.In the summer, they have evening concerts two nights during the week. They have car shows on the weekends. Check the city's calendar for the currents events happening, because there is always something going on.",Cucharina
40,Redondo Beach Pier,"Since being redone, its lost a lot of its appeal. If your in the area its a must to visit for first timers. The Pier offers a variety of foods, beverages and spirits. The view is awesome from Old Tony's be sure to have a Mai-Tai as, you get to keep the cool glass. Be sure to pop into the Arcade on the lower deck, its always fun playing video games. The boat rides are always fun, as they offer fast or slow boat rides depending on your preference.",885jt

50,Redondo Beach Pier Seafood is amazing!,"The pier and marina are awesome. But, what is really great is you can buy fresh seafood from fish to crabs right in the marina. The place we went to was Quality Seafood and we picked out two crabs and a Pomfert fish. They steamed them for us and then we ate them in a outdoors dining area. The price was fantastic and the seafood was amazing. I highly recommend this especially for those travelers who like to get off the beaten path.",Dave D
50,Wonderful place for the whole family,The pier was a lot of fun! Lots of shopping and places to eat for the whole family. Easy access to the beach.,cat p
50,Great Place to walk,"Definitely recommend to all family members, even business travelers - it's great escape from all those Internet-slave-caused stress.",Thomas F. Aisingioro
30,Touristy spot but not without entertainment value,"The Redondo Pier is a fairly complex structure built over the water, especially compared to the simple structures of the Hermosa and Manhattan Beach piers.And all that room means the Redondo Pier has far more restaurants and snack places on the pier structure. But most of the choices seem overpriced and designed to attract outside tourists. And the fact that so few South Bay residents visit a spot that's so close tells you something -- that food quality and fair prices are in short supply here.The location itself is lovely -- right next to the breakwater. You can also rent kayaks and ski-dos or do a whale watching tour. The pier does get a fair amount of visitors who fish from the pier. But there is some concern about that. All the fish bait that's used sometimes attracts sharks to the area -- 100 yards away is a popular swimming spot.So even though we live in the area, we avoid swimming and eating at the Pier. For the same prices, you can get far better food and ambiance heading down Manhattan Beach Blvd. to the Manhattan Pier area.",TimT_10
40,Casual Beachside Couples and Family Treat,"The Redondo Beach Pier brings back fond memories of childhood. The Pier has something for everyone and is quite charming with its diversity of resturants, beachside seafood ""shacks"" (in a good way), arcade, boat rides, bands and more. This weekend, September 25-27, the Lagoon which is right next to the Pier, hosted Lobsterfest....we were in bliss and had 4 lobsters, corn, potatos, craft beer and a fabulously delicious and relaxing time. We will definitely make this place a regular weekend spot.",Precisio

40,Enjoyable little side trip,This area is so much better than Venice Beach. It was fairly clean but had a bit of trash laying around. The homes in that area make the trip worthwhile. Some great and weird architecture to see. The beach is really wide and the sand was clean and beautiful. Glad we stumbled upon this area.,SVinLV
40,Soo goood!,Great! Needs to be a bit more cleaner. But the veiws and people arr all very friendly. Great placw for fishing as well as a great place to just sit and relax :) there are some locations of this were I actually fwlt like I was on the O.C t.v show! :),Alice E
40,Different style pier compared to Santa Monica Pier,A nice place to walk around a sunny day after eating the fresh seafood at the nearby Quality Seafood place! ^_^,Dwong2010
50,Good Diving,I was in Seattle diving with Seattle Dive Tours and this was our second stop. You suit up across the street and have a fairly easy entry down a short flight of stairs and into the water. Stay away from the fishing pier and descend down a slope. The wildlife is plentiful with plenty of macro and fish life. Eelgrass beds and multiple man-made structures make for an interesting dive. Definitely a dive to do in Seattle.,Charles R
20,not what it was,the place is full of lower class people. It usually smells very fishy. the resturaunts and stores are the same ones from yesteryear with no updates. it has not been changed or updated since it fell apart and fire of the 80's. what once was a great place to hang out no longer is,Marcthornton1
40,Good,This is a beach that's close to go to in L.A. They charge you $2 a hour to park and have a nice pier where you can walk around or go fishing! They have restaurants also to eat and shops to look at also! The beach is small but you can go swimming there also,Elizabeth L
40,Nice Clean Beach,Clean beach with lots of room to layout your umbrella and towel. It's great to ride your bike for a scenic tour of the area and ocean!,ELIZABETH P
30,Just Okay,"I visited this pier after eating at Tony's on the Pier (see that review), and it is nice to walk over the shore, but the pier was a bit run down. A lot of stores that sell random tourist items. It looked like it was under going renovations when I was there. That said it was still neat to see. Just be aware of the people fishing as they are not always paying attention and you could get hit with the pole, or a hook caught in you.",SithTRR
40,Nice pier. Naja's Bar was fun.,"Nice clean pier. They only reason I didn't give it 5 Stars is because there were not enough ""fun"" bars to go to. Miss the old Kegs and the friendly people running it. The two people working in the ""Slip"" the night we were there spent more time on their cell phones than tending tables. There Quality Seafood market/restaurant was yummy, but I'd rather walk an extra block and eat at Cap'N Kidds.",Lisa B

30,"Food, shopping, fishing, and, of course, the beach!","Great for a nice walk or a good dinner, plus you can also fish there. Although after the major fire decades ago, they never rebuilt Cattlemen's Restaurant (They had the BEST steaks!), however Old Tony's is still there and they do have great seafood (my sister and brother-in-law LOVE about the Mai Tai's!). There are plenty of other food establishments and also plenty of shops (plus a fee-parking structure). Its a good place to visit either before or after your time on the beach.",Steve H
10,Crabs stacked 6 high displayed in tanks :( Filthy beach,"The peir was OK, but 2-3 restaurants had these poor crabs so crammed into tanks ready to be eaten that we all found it too upsetting to be there. Also the beach is absolutely filthy. I have never seen so many bins on a beach in my life but no one uses them. Total laziness. Someone even left their dirty nappy on top of the bin. Yuk. Sort yourselves out Redondo. We ended up driving to Santa Monica beach even though Redondo was 3 minutes walk from our hotel. Pity.",Georgina W
40,Nice stroll to enjoy the good weather.,"Clean, tidy and a nice place to take a slow stroll either to enjoy the sea views, the shops or even just to watch the people fishing off the pier.",Oggy-5DayGuides.Com
50,Love to go there~!!,"Nice to walk, shop and have fun. Clean and safe beach! Great place to visit. They have great places to eat as well!!",travelusa1973
50,Great location to view the sunset,Went to the pier one evening for sunset watching. The pier was large with many restaurants. There were a lot of people fishing near the end of the pier so that was entertaining to watch. It is a great place to enjoy a sunset as parking is very close.,Avg_traveler_man
50,lovely,"I loved the place. Touristic but not crowded. The pier is beautiful, it has a lot of pelicans and nice restaurants. I ate at one that the food was awesome but I do'nt remember the price, anyway, if you are not used to the American' portion size, ask for the kids plate (as I do). You save money and it is more than enough. Moreover, walking in the sand is always a good choice. And nearby the houses are pretty, worthy a tour.",EstelaAltoe
40,Great walk,Fun place to hang out. Nice views and fun places to stop and shop along the way. It was really clean and safe.,Fl0rene
50,We had to pinch ourselves to prove we were actually here!,"One amazing experience....from live sea life to fresh seafood, to cooked fish and chips plus a great walk, cafes, touristy shops, walks, beach frolics, make a wonderful way to spend an afternoon at the famous Redondo Beach.",JennyWren6398

40,"Nice to stroll around, watch the see, the people and have some snacks","Great place to wander around to enjoy the ocean. There are plenty of small souvenir shops, places to sit, lots of quick snacks for sale, great fish places, you can see people clean fish, see the little boats in the harbor etc. Of course it is next to the beach and the Pacific ocean is an impressive piece of water that always has something to discover. I personally like the people watching the most. Did do my run at the boardwalk, the trail at the beach and at the pier and I enjoyed the breeze and the different new things to discover during my 8 mile run. There is a parking garage attached to the pier",DdeKerf

50,Whale watching not whale swimming,"An older pier. Locals and visitors alike use it to fish. You can watch the local fish tavern fish out the crab you choose or, in season the lobster. From there , walk along the beach or rent a bike. The bike rental is next to the Pier, next to Captains kids. The Farmers market is held next to the Pier every Thursday and there is a nice park with swings and a great sandbox for small kids. I read that one of the visitors swam with the whales. Although it is always possible, but if the whales were to come this close to the beach, they would get stranded which sometimes happen with baby whales in winter whale season is from late September to late April. It is dangerous to come between a whale mother and her baby as they can get separated. But you can book a boat tour during the season to do some whale watching. And who knows, maybe a whale will come up alongside the boat or a dolphin.",Sabine161033
40,Something for everyone,"Rent a pedal boat,kyak,or take a glass bottom boat ride. Have a cold beer at a bar with 150 choices.Pick your lobster and have it boiled up for you.Arcade for the kids. Redondo Pier has it all. Too many choices to fit in one review. Check it for yourself",Gail M
20,Sketchy and crowded,"The pier has really gone downhill in recent years. While it still has character, it's age has started to show and needs several repairs. The shops and majority of restaurants are touristy and unmemorable. The quality of characters hanging around has also sharply declined. While we used to love coming here, we will likely not be back.",kmack143
50,Round pier was different,"The pier was a bit run down but it has character. There were a lot of places to eat and the food we ate was delicious. We didn't stay long because we were not feeling so great after being robbed at the Best Western Plus hotel located at 1850 South Pacific Coast Highway, Redondo Beach, CA. If you are going to Redondo Beach I do not recommend staying there as ""someone"" unlawfully entered our room and stole my engagement ring. No forced entry suggests it was an inside job. I checked the Redondo Beach Police Department website and found the exact same thing happened to another person in April 2015, unforced entry and jewelry stolen. It's too late for us but not for you. Please be careful.",Wanderlust284

50,A Historic Landmark with great area dining and shopping,"In my lifetime, I've frequented this landmark after 2 fires and 3 hurricanes. One of my top-20 locations in the world to eat has been ""Tony's"" on the pier and the adjacent Charthouse. The seafood in this corner of L.A. is incredible. Shops nearby and on the pier are a good destination",GVish
40,Not a well maintained pier but it has character,"If you like fresh seafood where they cook it right there for you, then this is the right place to go. If you want fancy and new, this is not the place for you. Lots of places to go but nothing outstanding. It seems like a run down place even though it has so much potential.",johnwtmb t
50,"Wonderful bar at the end, lots of places to eat in and around.","My husband proposed to me on this pier, there is a circular quirky restaurant bar at the end. There were seals swimming all around and there a light shining into the water so you could watch their antics. ( nighttime) brilliant place to go. Romantic, beautiful ambiance.",Livelovelifelaugh
40,Cool fresh air,Refreshing place perfect for family and friends alike. Easy parking and lots of restaurant options from seafood to steaks. Lots of interesting characters too. One guy gave us a trillion dollar play money on July 3rd (wishing us a happy 4th). Would definitely visit again anytime I visit in southern california.,Jon T
30,Just Ok,"We walked along the pier and it was ok. A lot of fishermen along the way. Construction going on at the end of the pier so was a bit of an eye soar. I've been to better piers before so this one was just ok. It does have a lot of restaurants and bars. It also has a large arcade for kids/families, it just smelled very musty inside like there is no real air flow inside.",dgf40
50,Fun!,Just a fun pier to walk around. Nice shops and lots of good eats! After walking around the pier we headed north to Hermosa beach. It's was a nice walk.,sailregmel2016
20,Old and dried up!!,"You can tell, about 10 to 15 years ago, that Redondo Pier might have been a great attraction. Ummmm…. not so much currently. We were staying in the area on business and had some down time so we walked to the Pier. It filled our time, that is about all I have to say that is positive.",lobima4203
50,Fantastic for a walk and watching a sunset!,"The seafood available here was incredible, I was fascinated just walking along!

40,"Great Pier to Walk and Check Out Shops, Eateries, etc.","Whenever we are in the area we like to hit the Redondo Beach Pier a couple of times - just to walk up and down, maybe check out the fresh seafood to buy, perhaps have brunch at one of the eateries on the pier - always fun! Lots of seagulls, sea lions, interesting people, beautiful views, etc. I like the beach design decor throughout the pier area. Parking usually available, restrooms also.",Jean L
40,nice all inclusive beach pier,"A nice place to spend an afternoon enjoying the sun and surf. Plenty of parking when I dropped by. Like any beach location in Southern California, go early and avoid the weekends. I like that it is underground parking so your car is out of the sun. Relative to other places along the coast here, parking is relatively inexpensive. You pay at the machine. You can also type in your cell phone number so you get a text alerting you that your time is running out. It sure beats looking at your watch every 15 minutes. Lot of places to get some food from the sit down to the take way. Plenty of places to sit. Shape of the pier is not your usual straight in and out. It wraps around so fishing is limited to one side while the other more spacious side is cleaner and more tourist friendly with seats.",619Joey
40,Nice little pier,"Nothing like Pier 39 in San Francisco, this place has everything you might need while spending a day on Redondo Beach: affordable food, good drinks (see ""Tony's""), and the usual souvenirs (some even not that usual). Have a chat with friendly people, or even try fishing.",airbourne79
40,Line fishing spot also,"The pier has quite some nice looking restaurants and little shops. Especially at the boardwalk around the small marina there are some authentic looking fish restaurants. Parking was easy in a big parking garage for 4,50 per three hours. Quite some line fishing activity too with the fishermen cleaning the fish on the spot.",Hermes_NL 🇳🇱

50,Fun place!,"I haven't been here for 20 years and was very impressed with the renovations! Most of my favorite places are still here but the prices have gone way up. There is something for everyone from the large arcade, the specialty shops, many restaurants and pubs to the available harbor cruises! The adjacent beach is nice also. Bring your walking shoes as there is a lot of ground to cover to see everything!",Doozer2015
50,Fun place,"We had a great time visiting the pier. We stayed at the Portofino hotel, so it was a nice little walk. Enjoyed the shops and people watching. Went to Tony's (downstairs) for dinner and really enjoyed the quality of the food, and the service as great.",David L
30,Glo-sticks,We went at night and guess what: it's a pier that sticks out into the sea.A few restaurants for quick and easy food at the start but nothing flashy.The highlight (literally) was all of the people fishing off the end of the pier with 'glo-sticks' on the end of their lines do they could see their cast in the water.It seemed to work as almost every cast brought back a fish.Something to do in the evening at Redondo that isn't expensive or to taxing. My guess is it's much more lively during the day.,IanCON2013
50,"Offers fine dining, Shopping, walk to beach and fishing.","From Mexican food, seafood, cocktails, corn dogs, to shopping, you can rent paddle boats, go on a boat cruise, rent bikes, buy an oyster to make your own necklace or earrings, walk the boardwalk, rent a paddle surfboard or just enjoy the beautiful view this has something for everybody!

50,Plenty of variety here,"When you get tired of the hotel room, hit the pier.Bars, restaurants, shops, you name it. I live in the midwest and was fairly well entertained just watching the people. Saw some stuff that I'd never before seen, or even imagined. lol",hellwiththis
40,Very nice pier,"We visited this pier twice. First time was during the day, and it was beautiful. Lots of people walking around, eating great food, and enjoying the views. There are several restaurants to chose from. We went back for supper on a weekday night. The weather wasn't the best, so there were not a lot of people there. We did feel a little uncomfortable at times...safety wise. But, we would definitely go back during the day and take in all of the beautiful sights.",amy m

50,Awesome Family Stroll!,"After visiting the very over rated Venice Beach, we were very pleased with the more laid back n family friendly atmosphere ofRedondo Beach Pier and Boardwalk. My kids loved looking in the water and saw a stingray and some fish. The fresh fish markets were pretty cool, I tried a shrimp basket which was probably the best shrimp I ever had! The arcade looked like lots of fun but unfortunately was closed even tho we were there during the ""Open"" hours?? Kids were a little disappointed about that. If u don't like seafood theres a range of other choices at the Boardwalk! We look forward to going back and renting a paddle boat or taking a tour on ""The Looking Glass"" boat ride.",Jennifer B

50,Beach Cities' little secret,"Unlike Santa Monica beach, Redondo Beach is not as ""touristy"". Only the locals and friends of the locals know about this secret beautiful beach.Beautiful butterfly shaped pier has great restaurants along the way. Eating fresh live seafood and green tea ice-cream is a must for me!During the summer, there are also free concerts on the pier! I just bring my picnic chair or blanket and enjoy the music and the breeze.The wide pier also allows everyone to have a nice walk without feeling overly crowded. I don't fish but I am always curious what people caught.There are also constant birds and pelicans hanging around the pier walking amongst the people. Occasionally you will see seals playing and hunting, and sometimes whales migrating too!You can also rent paddle-boats, take a boat cruise etc at the pier. There is also an arcade.Just an awesome place!",AngyChin
50,Nice place to take a walk,"Take a sweater at night. The beakers and the sea air with waifs of fish markets and fishing, makes this a true pier. The shops are what you would expect sea shells and pearls. The soft serve Ice cream vendors selling bait and the gaggle of fisherman lets you know we still can get fresh food off the hook. I like to walk this place, play a little air hockey and people watch. Parking is plentiful if no events are going on it's about $2.00 hr. will worth the covered space. Worth the views and the sunsets.",Pennyharvest
20,Honest Appraisal of Redondo Beach Pier,Redondo Beach is a great town. There are however only three reasons to waste any time at the dilapidated Redondo Beach Pier: 1-Drink or eat at Old Tony's 2-Have a drink at Nasha's or Barny's Beanery 3-Make a circumvention of the Pier a part of your walk along the beach.,Harry A
30,"busy pier, with fun games and food.",We stop here sometimes and eat at barny's beanery. This is an old pier but has a lot of newer places to eat. There is an arcade with retro games that even the adults can enjoy.,michael b

50,Road Trip Stop,"We were driving from Santa Monica to San Diego and decided to stop here to stretch our legs (not that it's a long drive) and get lunch. So glad we had a chance to experience this pier. If you make your way to the top-most level and walk towards the water, the views are so relaxing and it's very peaceful (we were there on a week day). I imagine this is a lot more traffic on weekends. The options for food are plenty and you can order fresh fish from the popular Fish Market that resides at the pier. There is an arcade, paddle boats, and paddle surfing for entertainment. Glad we were able to visit this pier.",Traveling with T

10,Avoid the beach - BLACK TAR covered feet...,"The view from the beach and pier are spectacular - But after my wife and I took an hour walk on the beach our feet were covered with BLACK TAR... What made this very strange is that nothing was evident from the sand or waters edge. There was no obvious problems with the sand - No discoloration, no smell, no black color. Stopping on the sidewalk to get the sand off our feet we discovered the sticky black goo. We tried to scrape off the worst with small sticks but we were a mess until we got back to the hotel. There is some BIG problem on the Redondo Beach from the pier south. BEWARE !!",MtnManMDP
50,Cool place with a lot of beauty,Visited the pier to enjoy a Sunday afternoon was not disappointed. Very nice beach and relaxed atmosphere that offered shops and food places making it a great outing! Can't wait to go back. Park underground as it is easier to find parking there instead of street parking that is coin meter only.,Josco
50,"Fun, Sun, Food, Games, Inexpensive","Since the Redondo Pier was re-built after the hurricane a few years ago, it has become a mecca for young and old, families and singles, for one hour or all-day. Most visitors don't know about the Penny Arcade fun house underneath the parking lot (although most games cost a whole quarter !). Kids 4 to 74 love it !! The pier itself has souvenir shops and lots of eateries, including the best ice cream cones, a shack to rent fishing poles (you'll find at least 10 fishermen any time of day trying their luck), and old-timer Tony's bar and restaurant with it's fabulous elevated viewing room for romantic (but noisy) evenings watching the sunsets and drinking a well-alcoholed Firehouse cocktail - and you take home the glass. ( I stopped at a dozen).The new portion of the concrete topped pier is great to stroll on, listen to the occasional live band, watch the friendly birds and docile pelicans or the omnipresent porpoises and sea lions below, and then head down to the fish markets downstairs. Anything you want live from the ocean is there - unique varieties of fresh clams, oysters, crabs, lobsters, shrimp and all kinds of fresh fish - although the prices are not cheap. But the cost of a luncheon or dinner plate of fresh seafood is reasonable and for some reason it tastes extra special eaten on a picnic bench in the fresh air. Then ... there are the boat tours, for whale watching or just sightseeing outside the harbor, paddleboarding, paddle boating, and a wide lighted path that will walk you in 3 minutes to the Cheese Factory or the Crab Shack for an indoor sit-down dinner or dessert. Runners love to run along the harbor route and strollers just amble and enjoy the scenery.Caution - the underground parking lot gets gridlocked, often. Either park up top, a right turn into the first driveway before the entrance, or park on Catalina Ave and walk. You'll be glad you did. Oh, and did I mention the wide, beautiful beach - or the adjoining Veteran's Park with picnic tables and a full kids' playground? You gotta go, check it out.",David G

30,Redondo Beach Pier,"It's family oriented but does have a cople of great places I like for adult beverages, Tony's for food, drinks and view and Starboard Attitude for beverages and music.",Sugarplum skies
50,Best pier in the Southbay,"Restaurants, views, shops and ample parking make this the most family friendly pier in the Southbay! Classic dining try Tony's on the Pier, upscale dining at Kincaids and casual dining Barneys Beanery. Favorite shop the Redondo beach kite shop. Look for Spring and summer Kite flying event",Beacheyedoc
50,One of the Best Piers in this Area!,"We were pleasantly surprised by all the GREAT SHOPS, GREAT RESTAURANTS, and things to do and see on this pier! All the shop owners we encountered were very friendly and helpful! It was a busy 3 day weekend on the Pier and we wanted to try the glass bottom boats, but didn't have cash with us, wish they would take credit cards and we would have been on it! Will definitely return next time we are in this area and would highly recommend to anyone visiting this area!",GraceMountain
50,beautiful,"Down to earth, happy, friendly people Lovin life here. Love this place. Great food places to eat at. Definitely come back!",Daniel A
30,"Very fresh seafood, and a little taste of pelican","Our son just moved to Redondo Beach, so we took in the sites and visited the pier. I want to compliment the city on the ease of parking, but the restrooms are sketchy at best. We browsed the gift shops, and had some photo opportunities with the local pelicans that hang out at the end of the pier with the fisherman. The usual boardwalk food and treats, and you can choose your own live crab at one of the markets-restaurants on the pier.",Donald988
40,Sort of a fun place but the bathrooms are...,We visited the pier and had a good time. It was fun watching the fishermen and pelicans that hung around for food. Fun food places to eat...Great FRESH seafood but also liked the fast food and other restaurant options. Gift stores and ocean activities such as Stand Up Paddle or Kayaking were available. It's always nice to be on the ocean. The only neg. is the bathrooms were really pretty raunchy...,FlipFlopWanderer
40,Redondo Beach Pier,"Redondo Beach Pier was okay, nothing all that interesting. I did get a really good latte from Kona Coffee. At night almost everything is closed though.",Anne F
30,Fresh seafood but the worst toilets !,"Its a nice walk and there are some great seafood places, there is an arcade to amuse the kids and is in need of a bit of a spruce up. Unfortunatley it also had the worst public toilets I have been to in the US. The smell and lack of cleanliness put me off eating there!Hermosa and Manhattan beach were far more appealing.",nickic310
50,"Casual, Hometown Pier","That's what I like about the Redondo Pier ~ it's for the residents, not tourists. This means less hype, less sales tactics, and less flashiness.It's a casual, fisherman's delight with quite a few shops, even a great seashell shop that are hard to find in Redondo anymore!There are quite a few eating options, too.As you enter the pier from the main parking lot, you can find a great tourist shop to your left. It's not just for tourists though! We've found some fun gifts for friends and out of town guests there.The lighting is beautiful before and after the sun is at it's highest point, so bring your camera!",LivPurple
30,Not bad,Ive always loved the name Redondo and named a building we did in Calgary after this Beach. Its somewhat disappointing. The pier is a bit run down and the shops also are sub par. We did eat at a great restaurant which I will review also. The vibe during this time of year is better at manhattan Beach.,manium
50,Must See if your in the area,"This is a must see if you are in the area, Redondo beach is lovely and everything surrounding it is fab. Make the effort to come here if you are not far away as you won't be disappointed i can guarantee you that.",McPherson9
40,Sunset Pictures,If you have good weather go here for the classic sunset picture. The pier is also used by fisherman and the odd pelican can be found looking for scraps!Good local fish spots are found on or around the pier as well,Bill T
50,A must go beach,"Lots of restaurant selling all sorts of seafood. Love it. There are many activities such as submarine tour, standing paddling, kayaking and etc...... Very relax.",954hungg
50,I love the Redondo Pier,"Hi all~I'm a native to Los Angeles and I love going to the pier on my time off with family, friends, or just by myself. It's a great place for a date. I came here a long time ago and loved it at first sight. It has something for everyone. Scenery, food, shops, games, and much more. Don't forget your camera either. I always go and take great pictures. The shop owners are friendly and I like chatting with them when I go shopping. Go explore and have fun:)",Shawna T
40,Lovely walk,"Lovely walk around pier, lovely outlook, plenty to see, lots of eateries. Even old power station was made to look reasonable pleasant",Steve W
20,Not much,"Although this was a nice walk, there was very little activity on the pier. I'd say less than 15 shops and restaurants total. We did have lunch at Old Tony's which was very, very good!",Marsha857
40,So much to do,"Shops, restaurants, people watching, ocean views, bird watching…we could spend hours here. You can find expensive or inexpensive dining. While there are a lot of people, I never feel that it's so crowded you can't find your own space. Bathrooms on the pier were decent and clean.",chgo919
50,Beautiful!,"Love the walk to the pier great restaurants and shops, in the summer fun watching the bands playing music, watching the Dolphins, birds, surfures, volleyball, fishing, boating........ so much to do it is fun place to visit.",Beachvacation2015
40,Lots to do,"I liked it here, there are lots of shops and places to eat, beware seafood in this area is beyond expensive which I thought was odd since its local. I live in the prairies in the middle of Canada and we can get live lobster shipped to us for half the cost. Dolphins often frequent this area as well",ScarStar
50,The weekend before Thanksgiving,"If you want to avoid the crowds, the weekend before Thanksgiving is definitely the time to go to the pier. This was a really peaceful spot that weekend. Food vendors were open and the pier was all ours. It was blissful!",lbrock62
40,Lots of restaurants and bars!,"This is a lovely long Pier with shopping and restaurants to enjoy. Everything is within walking distance and the atmosphere is bright and friendly. Lots of people fish along the pier that has benches to stop and sit to enjoy the view. Even at night it is brightly lit. There is a wonderful stairway that has a pretty tile mosaic on it. We saw a couple with two parrots and we got to pet them while we were there! Bring your credit card, there are some great little shops with unique items to buy!",V-Retz
40,NIce Pier,"We went here to eat lunch. The pier has three parts and quite a few places to eat, we ate at Barneys Beanery, was really good. There are other sit down and walk up eateries. A few gift shops, displays and a great view. You can stroll the strand or just sit and watch the world. Fishing has a place here also. The crowds during the week were minimal. Easy access.",923JimM923
50,Oceanside Stroll,"Perfect place for a walk with family to enjoy the ocean and beach views. The pier is an easy walk and handicap accessible. Great variety of fresh seafood, lots of restaurants.",Kathryn T
40,Great Place to Shop for Souvenirs,Great Atmosphere to shop and dine and have a quick beer! Good variety of shops . Parking is convienient and covered.,Brian S
50,Best of the Southern California piers,This is my favorite of the LA area piers. Interesting and unique triangle layout provides several views. Love the proximity to the marina and shops and restaurants. Very quiet and uncrowded on a Saturday morning before 11am.,Mrs B
40,Must visit if you are in the area,Amazing pier with lots to do. Lots of shops and restaurants. Great views of the beach. You can even fish out at the end. A must visit if you are in the area,Nattysimps
40,Right in my front yard...,"Lucky to be a local, the pier is just 3 blocks away. There is plenty to do at the pier besides marvel at the sunsets. You can sail, kayak, paddleboard, lay in the arcade, at the freshest seafood, and my favorite...enjoy a Mai tai at Tony's on the Pier! The bike path weaves its way through the pier and marina, so you can easily bike(bike rentals in the marina area) up the coast.Enjoy!",bchgrrrl
40,Interesting place,We liked walking around the pier looking at the displays and out to sea. Some of the restaurants looked interesting but there were always huge crowds of noisy people around. We enjoyed it more earlier in the day.,MJH048
30,Ok if you're passing through,"This is a fairly ""normal"" pier, a little scuzzy around the edges with lots of junk food, tourist trinkets, and a few good restaurants. Still, it's a nice area with a good beach.",UltimateWines
40,The largest Pier in South Bay,"A place that offers a little bit of everything from live bands at the Starboard Attitude (21 and over) or sit at Tony's on The Pier in the ""Crowsnest"" and enjoy their Siganuture Drink and wach the Sunset and then go downstairs and dine or go over to Kincaids and sample one of their $175 a glass Cognacs. If you are budget minded then head down to the International Boardwalk where you can get Keg Beer for $2 bucks, Free Peanuts and a dinner for under $15. It is all there and easy to park with validation. Have Fun!",Carl B
30,"Fun for kids, but not much there","Fun pier to walk around. Arcade for kids that opens at noon, and some great restayrants like The Beanery. If you wanna try some fresh seafood, try Quality Seafood. It's about as casual as you get. Def bike up the strand to visit Hermosa and Manhattan",Erin L
50,Beach I,This was a nice laid back beach. Volleyball was great!! You could rent bikes and ride alongside the beach. The sunset is awesome. Make sure the bring a light jacket because it gets cool in the evening.,Tammy B
40,water sports,"A person could spend a day at this beach and pier. There are several restaurants, a fresh fish market, and a few shops along a boardwalk. Water sports seems to be the main draw - paddle board and kayak rentals, glass bottom boat tours, and deep sea fishing.",alison h
50,Gorgeous and clean!,Beautiful beaches that were completely not crowded. Spacious warm sand. Right on the ocean with lots of restaurants and bars to go to. Loved it!,katyb1980
40,By The Seaside,"Not at all like the Santa Monica Pier. It is a great place to out to watch the sunset, enjoy a meal or simply spend some unwinding.It does attract a wide variety of clientele. Not unlike most attractions in LA. You may meet some colorful characters and receive inspiration for your next tattoo.There is an old style fun zone with new and old games and a tilt-a-whirl. The ceiling is a bit low, so it is a bit noisy. The lighting is a bit low. I would not allow young teens or pre-teens to go escorted. But, overall fun can be had by all.When it comes to food, there is a wide variety. There are a number of fast food places, family places and higher end. Fresh seafood is readily available. The fish markets offer eat in or buy to prepare at home. Tony's is a long time local favorite featuring fish dishes. Kincaid's upscale steaks and seafood. El Torito is a Mexican food chain. Capt Kidd's just north of the pier is another strong local favorite.The pier constantly has fishermen and women in residence. Sometimes they will land an interesting specimen from the deep for examination.",LifesaSnap
50,Beautiful and Alive.......,"This is a pier unlike any other in the area. Most piers are a straight line, you go up, see the fisherman and one restaurant and back and you are done. This is a triangular shaped pier with a hole in the middle to look at the clean waters and the seal that swims around there.This has a variety of shops, fast food of all genres and larger restaurants and bars then underneath in the back is a funhouse for kids and young at heart adults full of games and a whole lot more shops and restaurants to check out. My favorite part was on the pier where the fishermen are throwing chunks of fish to the huge pelicans that sit of the roof of one of the snack shacks staring down at everyone walking by just waiting for their treats. Note: you have to pay for parking but it is minimal.",LaPuenteCA
30,Kitschy but good to bike or walk around.,"The beach is beautiful. The pier is definitely targeting tourist and not really my cup of tea. If you want an enjoyable walk or bike ride, I recommend the beach, but I skipped the pier.",Lisa J
30,Just average,"Just a pier with the usual souvenir shops, fast fried food, some restaurants. I have lived in this area for years, unless we have company from out of toen, we don't frequent the pier. Not a lot to see or do.",ncjc2013
40,LAID BACK WITH LOTS TO OFFER,"I've lived at the Redondo Pier for 30+ years and it is a wonderful place to live, to visit, to dine or just to hang out. There are good restaurants - Kincaids and Tonys that are on the Pier, Blue Water Grill and Joes Crab Shack that are also on the water and within walking distance of the Pier. And for one of the best breakfast spots in the area there's Polly's On The Pier - good menu and you always get plenty of food. Then there are the smaller, widely varied cuisine spots that are on the Boardwalk. If you like to fish there are always plenty of fishermen casting their bait from the Pier. Also several boat operations will take you out for a ride or for a bit of fishing. Then the usual shops - hats, pearls, tee shirts you name it. If you want to bicycle there are bike rental shops. And there is a bike path that runs all the way from Redondo to Santa Monica for your pedaling pleasure. If you just want to toss out a towel and roast in the sun the Pier is the place. The Pier is a family oriented spot but everyone will be comfortable all the way from the beach stroller to the diner to the surfer. A good way to spend a day, an afternoon or an evening. There is plenty of reasonable cost parking immediately at the Pier and several bus lines serve the area.",LHANN2013
50,I live here and it's incredible!,"I feel like I'm on vacation everyday really. My favorite things to do here are just riding my beach cruiser on the strand (boardwalk that runs parallel to the water). I suggest catching a sunset on the upper level of Tony's restaurant at sunset. They usually have live music too. I bring all of my friends and family from out of town here all the time because it's such a great place. Hermosa pier and Manhattan pier are right by Redondo too, so it's easy and awesome to bounce around. You can ride bikes to and from all of them very easily. Enjoy!",Christmas C
30,Pier preassure,Not a bad place to hang out once in a while. Huge crowds on weekends and holidays. You can arrive hungry and go home full.,frfry01
50,Great place to take the family.,"A bit of fun and some great restaurants. We had our last meal on the boardwalk before heading back to Australia, we wished we found it sooner.",TravellerKHN
30,Tourist destination or working pier?,"I couldn't decide if this was a 'working' pier trying to be a tourist destination or a tourist destination that got mixed up with the fishing industry.There are hundreds of private and commercial boats moored within the pier's sheltered marina. The quay-side is lined with fish merchants and quick cheap eateries. The pier itself is a crescent, anchored to the shoreline at both ends. One end features a smart entrance pavilion with a restaurant, the other end is entered via a cavernous and malodorous concrete car park. The size of the parking lots suggests that this is a very popular destination. Mid-week in October the place was virtually deserted.What's to do? Look at the boats, stroll past the dozen or more fish restaurants and amusement arcades, stretch your legs with a walk round the pier. Been there, done that, didn't buy the T-shirt!",Steve M
50,first time in so cal...the pier has it all!!,"plenty of parking near the pier, so park your car and get out and get going.from the pier you canaccess boat rides or rentals you can fish or site see, shop, buy and fly some of the best kites made. huge ice cream cones, rock hop on the breakwater but the best of all is the sea food, the local crab you pick live from a huge tank(don't get pinched) they steam them for free, that gives you 10 min. to order a fresh loaf of bread a ice cold mug of beer, find a great outdoor table, sit down with your little wooden hammer and tub of melted butter and your eating some of the best crab on the planet (save king crab of coarse) now go people watching and if that or the crab don'tmake you fall in love with Redondo beach then there is no hope for you!",tim m
50,REALLY ENJOYED MYSELF!!!,"Fun place w lots to do. I saw a sunset there, that was magnificent. Lots of shops, restaurants, arcade, etc. The pier was really nice. What stood out for me was........... the area was very clean. no hobo's or that type of element there. Great place for families. Live music. Fresh seafood",oneeddy1
30,Pleasant walk but nothing special,This pier is like other piers around the area with restaurants and shops. Restaurants are mostly seafood restaurants. There are also Japanese restaurant and ice cream palour. There are also souvenir shops.There are many local fishing at the pier. I saw a seal by the pier.Parking is not free but reasonable.,DavidNYC11
30,starting point for the strand walk,"This pier is like santa monica pier with shopping and eateries, but without the carnival rides. With regards to the places to eat most are seafood based and range from fish and chips, crabcakes, fried calimari, shrimp, etc. Also, there are fresh fish markets located here. Some other attractions are a high speed boatride, and some rental boats. Access via public transportation is thru the BCT bus line which stops at the following green line stations: aviation, douglas, redondo its a midsize commuter type bus. For my purposes i generally use this as a starting point to walk from here to the manhattan beach pier via a bike/walkway called the strand about a 3 mile walk one way. This pier is more likely to be frequented by the local crowd",Hoben01
50,A must see for Southern Cal visitors!,"I've seen the pier change over the years. But, I must say, as I have aged, it is the cleanest and classiest o most of the piers in So. Cal. Authentic feel of fishermen right from the dock adds to the ambience.. My personal favorite restaurant is Old Tonys. Highly Recommended! Beautiful views of the shoreline from San Pedro to LAX.On a rare super clear day, you can see Catalina with no problem.",Bodimach
30,Mish mash of nice and...,"mix of characters, both the shops and people that flock the area. lot's of funky, fishy aromas, waft into your eager nostrils. as well as all the cig smoke. why does every other person have a gawddamn cig in their mouths??lot's o' fried food, hot dogs, and of course, seafood.when i was a youngster, my folks would bring me and my baby sister here, along with grandparents and aunts and uncles that would visit from the motherland. this was way before the famous pier fire that destroyed the OG pier.came here when our son turned 4.5 months old (about 2.5 months ago) to introduce him to the ocean. after about 30 mins, he was done with it! LOL after crying himself to sleep in his uber deluxe stroller, compliments of grandma and grandpa, the wife and i walked around for another half hour to try and get the most from our outing.parking is cheap! huge plus.",rob c
50,So much life!,"I went to the pier at sunset and it was beautiful! Lots of entertainment, food, and life!! Just walk around and take in the different scents.... so many unique smells from the restaurants to the ocean!",Linpin6800
40,A fine promenade,This is a tourist friendly place and biking & walking are encouraged.There are several dining options by the pier and there are a couple of nightclubs too.,vishwanath v
50,Another great pier,"California piers are the best. Visited Manhattan Beach two years ago, and Redondo last year and this year. The combination of salt air, a large variety of restaurants to choose from, the weather, and great energy make for a highly enjoyable visit. Also a great bus system in and out of the pier. $1 buys a ride from Torrance each way. It is simply a relaxing yet energetic place to stroll and enjoy being outdoors.",Thomas W
50,Beautiful at any time of day,"I went to the pier every day on my visit to Redondo Beach. My hotel, Redondo Pier Inn, is very close to it so it made for a lovely walk in the morning or in the evening. My favorite in SoCal so far!",Demetra M
40,A Clean and sturdy pier,"Several very good restaurants to choose from and a few eclectic shops. Parking is easy. It is save, well lit, and a fun place to be.",SOCGAC

50,LOVE IT.,"I was born and raise in Redondo Beach and its wonderful to come back and see my home town. I cave always loved the Pier, I have never been to a better one. It is a great place to walk,l eat and drink, it has beautiful views pf the sunset and is great foe fishing. It is gray for the sole family.",Richard C
40,Melting Pot,All nationalities strolling and eating on a Sunday afternoon.Fresh fresh seafood. Great exercise walking the entire pier.Leaving the parking lot was an exercise in PATIENCE.,Dee214
50,Great People!,Visit Starboard Attitude for live music and Karaoke - Older crowd but fun as hell. The beach was amazing with pike and ped lanes along the whole strip. There's a rocky area and sandy areas- A little too much kelp and stuff with flies buzzing around it in certain places- but no man made litter- clean water.,Lauren F
30,Not as nice as it was 3 years ago,I was here 3 years ago and it was cleaner and buildings were full. Lot of empty space here now. Starting to look rundown. Still looks busy but if they do not make changes it will become a dump. I enjoyed it but not sure I would come back.,Bigo1952
50,LOVE THIS PLACE,I've Loved this place since I was a child. I will always come back when I'm in southern Cal. The shops and the food are tremendous. Tony's was always my favorite restaurant. I hope they stay open.,Richard B
30,It was ok,"Pier was kind of cool, but the people made it a little off. Seemed a little dirty. The bathrooms were AWFUL! I mean AWFUL. Tons of seafood restaurants that made the whole area smell like fish. I would skip it and hit Hermosa Beach. We did stop in a bar on the way out for a quick drink. There was a bar called Tony's that sat up high, but way too hot in it.",dolittledigger
40,Fun Time,This is a fun pier for going out on a stroll. There are some little boutique shops along with restaurants and bars. We enjoyed cocktails and watching the sunset from the famous Tony's on the Pier. Their bar at the top has a spectacular ocean view.,Teresa L
50,Excellent Beach/Pier!!!!,"Awesome Place!!! Boardwalk, shops, dining, play area for kids, very well designed. Lots of bathrooms, several lifeguard stations. Clean beach! Nothing that I didn't like! Great family beach!!",Tyizaqt

50,REDONDO BEACH PIER KING HARBOR,"IT IS AN AWESOME PLACE..Many restaurants and shops...Beach all along by the pier.There are Pedal Boats, Paddle Boards, Jet Ski Kyacks and more to rent at a very reasonable price.",ODW2014
40,Interesting place to visit,"The pier area is surrounded by restaurants specializing in seafood, especially crab and lobster. You can pick one out of a tank and they will cook it for you on the spot. It was packed on the day we were there with long lines. (I have to say that personally I could never do that as I could never eat something that I saw living) Anyway it is a popular place to go and you can go on a boat ride, whale watching ride, or just look at all the boats moored there.",A D
50,Amazing this pier looks so charismatic,This Pier is really nice place to walk and go around.It is totally unique and people would love this place,saisriorl

50,Entertaining shops and good food available.,Stop by the fish market to view and/buy the great amount of varieties of seafood. Prices are respectable. Good price in the mussels! Tony's is a good place to stop for a drink or food. Great view. The shops are interesting and there are plenty of pubs to visit. Good places to eat and the walk around. Public Bathrooms are plentiful and clean. Worth the walk or park your car at the pay parking lots. The Shrimp Lover and Kincaids are both good stops.,Spikey116
40,Fun walk,Walked around Redondo Beach Pier in the evening. Lots of people watching. Great atmosphere. Lots of local bars and restaurants. Parking was easy but make sure you pay and keep track of your time!,Jay G
40,Always exhilorating,"Several times a year my husband and I stroll the Redondo Beach Pier. Since living in the area for more than 50 years, I have observed changes and yet the pier continues to exude charm. In addition to restaurants and shops, people can fish from the pier and people can stroll it. Parking is ample in a nearby lot or a few blocks away. The pier is located near the old city library situated in a park that overlooks the Pacific. The library is now used for private functions. I enjoy the scenery and how relaxed I feel after my visit.",tapbelle
50,The pier,Saw my first whale beautiful with Santa Monica pier and other things to keep you and your family busy. Go and enjoy all LA County has to offer. Including Hollywood Blvd and others.,Eric B
30,tourist trap,It was dirty and the filthy restrooms were disgusting. There was certainly nothing special there. Even the view of the ocean was nothing special.,Myna13
20,Low class area,"Smelly, loud, low class experience. Parking is difficult. The restaurants are mostly Asian, some with patio seating, but who wants their food to get cold in two minutes? The indoor option is out because of the overwhelming smell of fried seafood, which stinks up one's clothes in minutes.",FREQ_DINER10
50,Great stuff.,"Beautiful location, so etching to see and do at all times of the day and night. Short walks to interesting restaurants, bars and amusements.",JonHourihan
40,Worth a visit.,Redondo Beach Pier is a pretty nice pier/boardwalk. It is very family friendly unlike some of the others. Plenty of souvenir shops and walk up restaurants. Great place to get a drink or people watch. Quality Seafood has a large selection and delicious. Plenty of reasonable parking.,gslape
40,More to see....,"The City is slowly upgrading the good old Redondo Beach Pier. This year a Barney's Beanerie opened with good pub faire, lots of brews and the large menu the place is known for. Best of all, they opened an open air dining area between it and the El Torito. Great PV and Ocean views. El Torito and Tony's and Kincades remain the other main sit down restaurants. El Toritos a reliable chain restaurant, with a great view. Tony's remained unchanged since the 50's, and Kincades higher end seafood and steaks. A variety of counter food places remain, though spruced up by a nice face lift. A couple of very popular asian places, as judged by the crowds...but unless you speak the language..... A few places are empty, which is a sign that the Pier is still not a major destination with the money crowd. But getting there. Some fun free concerts during the summer, and lots of parking...but it does fill up as beach goers use it as well.",richgg
50,Fun Factory!!!,"The Redondo Beach Pier is super fun. Tonys is there. Fun stuff to eat. Cool seafood to look at and eat. This Review is for the Fun Factory specifically. Its super fun. Skee Ball, Air hockey, games, etc. We go here all years round because there is so much fun stuff today. We love playing Skee ball and collecting our tickets to exchange for fun prizes. Its a full service arcade. Here is the best part though. Something you might not notice form the outside. They have a Tilt-A-Whirl inside the arcade. Yup, read that again. Inside the arcade. The best part is if its a grey day or there isnt a big line, the operator will whirl you extra. That thing gets whipping. The rest of the pier is just great people watching. Great views of the coast. Rent a paddle boat and go out in the harbor and look at the sea lions. Glass bottom boat tours. Good times!",Jack S
50,"Great Beach Day for Families, Couples, and Friends","My husband and I live in Redondo Beach, and we go to the pier often in the summer. There is a lot of parking under and around the pier; however, sometimes it's difficult to find parking if you go in the late afternoon or go early evenings on weekends in the summer when it's crowded. The parking spots are marked with numbers, and people pay at pay machines located in the lot. If you enter your cell phone number, you will get a text 10 minutes before your parking expires. You can add minutes from your phone to extend your time.There are several different kinds of restaurants such as El Torito, Tony's on the Pier, Zeppy's Pizza, Redondo Beach Crab House, Hot Dog on a Stick, Charlie's Place, and other fresh fish businesses. We like to take the grandkids to Charlie's Place for hot dogs, hamburgers, and ice cream. When we go as a couple, we usually have dinner at El Torito. The service is usually a little slow and the food a little overpriced, but the view of the beach and water is beautiful. After dinner we head onto the lower part of the pier and go to Naja's. They have a copious number of beers on draft and live music every night.On the first Sunday of the month at noon, you can go sailing with South Bay Sailing. The boats are docked right across from Naja's. We took the grandkids there last Sunday, and they loved it. We paid $35 for each adult and $10 per grandchild to sail with an expert sailer for an hour towards Palos Verdes and back. South Bay Sailing also offers free donuts and free bbq'ed hot dogs on the dock.This summer there is live music on the middle section of the pier that runs parallel to the beach on Thursdays and Saturdays from 6:00 PM to 8:00 PM. The music varies from jazz, classic rock to 70s and 80s depending on which date you go. We've gone three times, and there's always a crowd. Some people bring beach chairs to sit on. The parking is usually tough before the concerts.If you're up to biking, the bike path runs through the pier, and there are places to lock up your bikes. When we take our bikes, we usually park for free on N. Francisca Ave off Herondo Street and head down Herondo on our bikes towards the beach. We go left at Harbor Drive and bike right onto the pier. It only takes a few minutes. Soon, however, there is going to be remodeling on that corner, so the free parking is not going to last too much longer.There are restrooms on the pier. A little the south of the pier, there are also restrooms behind the bike path with nice outside showers.There are lots of things to do on the Redondo Beach pier, and you could easily spend a day there walking around eating and shopping or just watching people fish. It's a fun place to spend a warm summer day on the beach.",cherold598
40,"Seemed more of a pier for locals, but still lots to do",There were plenty of restaurants and small shops and there was an arcade that the kids enjoyed. We enjoyed the easy access from the Crowne Plaza to walk to the pier each night.,AmberG8R
40,Come for the cheap & casual seafood,"There are some eateries along the pier but the place to go to is the ground floor where there is a wide selection of fresh seafood available for sale - from crabs to clams to fish to squid to shrimp. It's no fancy place but they can do a simple steam or fry on the spot. When the seafood is this fresh - that's all you ever need to enjoy great seafood! Place can get crowded on weekends and the seating area can be grimy so ask for a takeaway if you prefer your own space, or you can choose to eat in one of the cute eateries with a view of the yatchts in the marina. If you want a more posh meal, there are nicer restaurants out on the pier - comes with a price tag, of course.Beach wise, i recommend the waters / beaches at nearby Hermosa. Much cleaner stretches of clean beaches.",leavethewritingtome
40,Nice place to visit and have a bite to eat.,The Pier at Redondo Beach is a great place to visit with family and friend. There are many restaurants and places on the pier to eat and enjoy. Great views of the ocean from any angle around the pier. great fresh seafood in most of the restaurants there. you need to pay for parking but its not expensive.,Roxfun
50,Perfect beach!,Very wide beach and lots of space. Really clean. Changing room facilities well-placed. Can thoroughly recommend for visitors kof all ages!,jc63Stockholm
50,Love This Place!,"Redondo Beach is almost a perfect seaside town. The pier is one of the best in the Los Angeles area. There are plenty of choices for food and drink nearby. There are many places to get good seafood. You can buy a whole crab and eat it right there. They cook it for you and give you a small wooden hammer to crack the shells. I don't remember the name of this place but it is very close to the arcade. They have plenty of other choices such as clams, oysters etc.The arcade has plenty of games to keep the kids (and adults) amused for a while. We like to play the air hockey game there.If you walk up the stairs through the parking structure you can see the rest of the pier and the ocean. There is a nice beach and a bike path also which goes all the way up to Malibu (if you head north).This is a great area to spend a few hours! There is no fee for the pier but you do have to pay for parking. There are usually many people fishing from the pier. If you get lucky you may even see a peilican or a sea lion here.",JohnB00007
50,Great pier relaxing fishing,"Amazing place for the family and fresh seafood , I absolutely love the fact that it has great parking that you could pay almost anywhere on the pier, especially when you decide to have more time at the pier. The ocean is just amazing during the summer months, feeling that hot sand on your toes then splashed with this refreshing cool ocean water. The view is spectacular almost everywhere you look, and when your hungry there is a huge range of choices. From Classical American, to wharf style seafood and even asian here ! I love the fact that the ocean remains clean and your can walk on the ocean through this long bridge. Its an amazing place to realax and let the sun and breeze flow through your head,",1lorimer
50,Best seafood in this side of the world,truly enjoyed our dinner/stroll along redondo beach pier. the seafood is cheap and you can have it cooked anyway you like them. perfect after an afternoon lazy stroll by the beach,russspotting
50,Love this pier!!,"This was one of my favorite places to visit on our trip to CA. The first time we went, it was with 11 other families to go to the beach. The was isn't crystal clear but it did not matter, we all had a blast. There was lots of seaweed near the shore so watch little ones so they don't get tangeled up in it. There was plenty of parking in the under ground garage and we only paid a few dollars. There are fresh water showers, life guards and plenty of room for all. We ate up on the pier after a day of swimming and food was good and pretty quick considering we had 40+ people. We came back another day to swim and kids wish they had brought boogie boards because the waves were a little stronger (bigger). We walked down the pier and could hear seals barking and saw pelicans. Lots of people fishing, cute shops, food available too. My husband and 2 kids (11 & 8) returned to have dinner at Joe's Crab Shack on our last night. The food was good, serve excellent and view outside awesome. Lots of paddle boarders, boaters and seals to watch go by. We walked from the restaurant (fee parking) to the pier and found a big fish market. The employees were awesome and let me kids touch a huge lobster ($80 lobster) and showed them live crawfish and some squid. It was cool. Across from that was the Redondo Beach Fun Factory which was a large under ground arcade. It had a tilt-a-whirl, tons of skeeball, air hockey tables, arcade games, carnival games, etc. Everything was 25 or 50 cents. There are some very old games which really brought me back to my childhood. I am 43. I won't spoil the surprise by nameing them. It's an old place and a little run down, but I would reccommend stopping in if you are there. Lots of great photo ops too...bring the camera!! We saw dolphin and seals in the water...cool.",Kelli S
50,Amazing,Redondo beach is one of my favorite places in CA it's beautiful... it's perfect to spend a day running or cycling in the morning and have a good lunch after that,Ulisses_Couto
30,"Fun Factory, Very strange.","We enjoyed the pier at first and then we were at the Fun Factory arcade for about 1 hour. We enjoyed playing games for a while and then realized how strange the arcade was. Very old video games, some that were broken, some that were clearly rigged. Then we took our game tickets to the redemption area to pick out our prizes and it got REALLY weird. There was stuff there from the 1980's and 90's. Honey that was 8 years expired. We decided to get the mystery box because it was all so weird. We got the box and it had a travel mug (not the safe type) old baseball cards from the early 90's, a mechanical pencil with no lead, a protractor, and a bunch of other little weird items. VERY strange place to go.",Mark K
40,Beautiful!,"This little pier area is beautiful. It is 30 minutes from the LAX car rental areas, so is ideal if you want to be close to the airport and take some fresh air before the travelling. There are some good restaurants and take out food outlets. Also some last minute tourist shops.",Simon P
30,"Typical Pier Sights, Sounds, Smells","I thought this place was really average, except for food prices which were really high. A can of soda and dipped cone $6. Other than that, there were the typical shops with tchotchkeys, shirts, key chains, and magnets. There were lots of people fishing, seagulls, fishy smells, and people walking around. Exactly what you'd expect. Nothing too noteworthy. I wouldn't go out of my way to visit.",KniteRiter
40,Blue Whale,Beautiful saw my first blue whale ever it was breathtaking. The sea lions come through once a year. I can't wait to go back and enjoy all California has to offer.P.S. check out the poop deck which is a bar on the board walk.,Eric B
30,Great place to relax,"We went here to unwind and breath some fresh air. The pier has so many shops and restaurants to choose from. You can also go fishing, just rent a fishing pole for $8 and you're on your way. There's high and low end restaurants that you could choose from, it's really up to you what type of resto/atmosphere you want. Overall it's a great place to roam around.",Michica
20,Where are all the shops/restaurants?,Why is this pier so vacant? Why are there so many law/doctor offices and not little shops and restaurants? Very weird...,Brad Beers
40,Picture perfect...,This place is a seafood lovers dream with breathtaking views. If I lived in the area I would probably be here every weekend.,LushLocs
10,Nasty Pier,"Yuck! Sorry to say the pier and the carnivalesque people on the pier were gross. Several souvenir shops, Hot Dog on a Stick, fish houses and a pizza place. Lots of shady looking characters and I will say ""skanky"" because it is true. Several bars, ""Tony's"" and too many drunk people out and about. I didn't feel safe...not the place for me.",Alisa C
50,Redondo Beach Pier and Boardwalk,"Redondo Beach pier and Boardwalk is just minutes south of Los Angeles International Airport. Shuttle buses run from LAX to Redondo Beach regularly. I visited Redondo Beach with three friends. This place is perfect if you want to get away for a weekend. Nice beach scene and of course, the Boardwalk. The combination of good food and ocean smells are terrific. The higher end restaurants are a little pricey, but there are also vendors on the boardwalk which are cheap to grab a burger or quick lunch. I`ve always loved the Boardwalk in Atlantic City and this is pretty much comparable to that. You can walk on the pier over the water and the sea mist is reallly refreshing. Remember, you don`t have to spend a fortune here to eat. If you really want to have a great time and clear your head, this is the place to go. I love the beach here where you can soak up some sun or play volleyball and look for sea shells. The people are friendly and welcoming but it can get a little crowded on the weekends.",Azaria W
40,Friday night is busy,"This pier offers nice views and decent walk. There are many restaurants around except on weekends it appears to be very busy.Some restaurants are overpriced, especially the American style restaurant on the right hand side of the pier which we would have gone to if not for the price.It makes for a nice evening if you want to get a feel for Redondo. The O.C tv show also filmed on the pier and at the coffee shop on the top left of the pier where Ryan worked, so also good for location stalking.I enjoyed walking along it.",Enchanted Serendipity
50,This Pier was a Real Surprise,"I was visiting my son in SoCal and we really didn't want to hang out in East LA where he works so we headed to the coast with little or no expectations. Redondo Beach turned out to be a real hoot, particularly on a Sunday afternoon, with big crowds and lots of ethnic families celebrating with great fresh seafood from a number of seafood bars, lots of real beer flowing and just a great setting for enjoying the cooler air of the sea. Reminded me of Monterrey, but less touristy. NorCal visitors should consider this as a destination instead of heading solely to Santa Monica and West LA.",Gratontraveler
30,Working to be great. Still work to be done.,"The pier is on a perfect plot in the South Santa Monica Bay and it has plenty of parking. The pier itself is in the middle of a significant upgrade, which was a bit (long) overdue. There are some newer businesses and nicer storefronts coming in. Those now appear a wild mix against the old-school backdrop of churro stands and fried fish places. If you're into that old school thing it's still got plenty for you. If you're looking for that newer, cleaner feel... it'll take a few years yet.",fozzetti
10,Avoid Redondo Beach Pier on weekends,"Although the sun and sea make this area beautiful, the sheer press of humanity and the awkward and inconvenient public parking procedure on weekends make this a place to avoid unless you are a local resident. Not a good place for first time tourists. Other than KinKaid's at the top of the pier, the restaurants are not clean, poorly maintained (especially the restrooms) and expensive for the quality of food you can find. Avoid the large, cafeteria style restaurants particularly. It is popular with families and seems safe.",Ethel L
40,Nostalgic,"Great location with a mixture of small shops, bars, cafes and restaurants. We ate at Tony's and had a really good dinner. The area was busy as it was Easter weekend. The ocean and beach views are impressive. The pier appears a little tacky in parts and access to it from the beach at one end is through a car park.However we loved it and it reminded us of beach resort piers back home in the UK as they used to be. You can smell the ocean and certainly taste it in the little shops selling fish and crabs.",Aathony
40,Superb place,This one is a nice place to visit around LA. If you are coming by your own car you can park that at the basement with a small price ( < $1).The pier is very clean and is full of restaurants and shops.The restaurant offers good seafood and drinks. It offers lot of activities for all ages. You may rent a boat to see whales or may take guided tour for the same. However the place is very windy as expected and thus it is advised to have proper clothing to keep yourself warm. The best time ti visit this place is during evening when it is full of activities.,livewithdream
40,nice place for a jog or stroll,"beautiful beach lots of activities for all ages. you have jogging and cycling trails, nice beach, lots of restaurants. parking is a bit tough .. be early.",SudhaGovi
50,Great place to visit!,"if you are traveling to L.A area you have to visit Redondo Beach!!, try to stay there at least 1 night to visit the Pier,you can find there a lot of Restaurant with awesome seafood and drinks,believe me it is Awesome in the night!! ,live music and excellent to share with friends.",franklin c
40,Beautiful seating but crowded,"Redondo Beach Pier is a throwback to older times. My 3 year old grandson loves it, my son not so much. The food is boardwalk food with sea-food thrown in. Corn dogs and churos are my grandson's favorite food so the Pier is fun.",Cwinner
50,Amazing views at the end of a long journey,Totally beautiful setting and we watched the sunset go down sipping wine in a local bar. Very civilised and a totally gorgeous setting.,behappy222
50,Awesome sunsets,"A visit to the pier is always a must for me when visiting Southern California. The sunsets are absolutely beautiful! The walkway is great and there are many shops and restaurants to chose from. My favorite is Tony's on the Pier. Parking is easy and close by. Besides the underground garage there is also public parking nearby. Awesome views. Accessible beach, friendly people and lots of bird watching opportunities as well as fishing. Worth a visit",luvhawaii707
50,A great evening,"Can easily spend an evening here...nice restaurants, dessert places, people watching, shopping, fishing, etc.",BandMD
30,Ok for a short visit,"I have been to the pier the food is maybe average, typical pier seafood. I did not go back to eat as I was not that impressed by the restaurants. The pier itself is good for a walk and being close up to the pelicans and other bird life was a good experience. In the summer I enjoyed the fact that live music was offered free to anyone who wanted to attend. I saw at least two bands whose music was the kind I enjoy.",Philipd56
50,Steep path from street level to pier anyone using a wheelchair would need help.,Pier area is level and fully wheelchair accessible many shops and places to eat. We did use them but public transit buses w/c accessible and come to the pier.,wheelchairtraveler
30,Calif seashore experience,"If you are a tourist and want an all inclusive seashore experience, this is the place. Park your car (or take a bus) and spend the whole day. Beach, pier, restaurants and shopping. What more could a visitor want?!!!",vazmann2
40,Nice place to walk around,"We stopped here on the way to San Diego from Santa Monica and it was definitely worth a stop. We did not go on the beach, but walked around the pier and went into some of the shops. The kids got snacks. It was a little cool/windy on the day we went, but still a nice walk. There were some people fishing on the pier and some nice views. Also neat to see the pelicans up close. It was not busy when we went (Wed afternoon), with parking close by in metered parking. A nice break from sitting in the car.",DrMacGyver
30,It was a pier. Maybe we were there too early in the day,"It was a pier ... nothing more, nothing less. Lots of shops and restaurants I agree - so in that respect, there way more than most piers, but I'm not sure I'd make a trip out there again. It did have a bit of a retro feel to it, which was fun ... and maybe if we were there later in the day (we were there in the morning, it was super duper quiet except for the people fishing) there would be more going on to experience. Parking was easy and plentiful and cheap - at least for us. I think it cost something very inexpensive, like $2. There are plenty of shops though because I'm not much of a shopper, I didn't go in any. We did grab some snacks to eat, and there are many food vendors on the pier.",clamc40
50,Fun in the sun,Great place to walk and enjoy the California sun. Little stores and restraints to keep you busy. Easy parking,IBLounge
50,Lots of variety,"The pier offers great views, fishing, restaurants, fish markets, options to stroll or bike ride and a view of the happenings in the harbor. It's like any pier and can have a fishy odor, but I love the variety of the shops and restaurants, especially Tony's restaurant from 1952. The interior and exterior is very vintage. I love the access of the beach to the pier. It's a great place to view the harbor traffic and a sunset!",ladybuglouise
50,Excelent Place to visit,"Redondo Beach Pier is one of the beautiful pier I have visited. There are many stores and restaurants and a wonderful view. If you are lucky, you can meet see lion on the rocks near pier.",claudio_kliemann

40,Fun atmosphere,Good live music regularly. Cool shops good food cant complain. all in all fun to stroll every once in a while.,AugtronA
30,Just like any ordinary pier view,"Went there several time, not for the pier but for the 'Quality Seafood' there. While waiting for the crabs to be steamed we had a walk down the dock. Well, the view was just ordinary. It's OK if you drop by and get some fresh seafood, but it's not worthwhile for just a long travel to here for the pier.",earthhitchhiker
40,Christmas and Beautiful,"The weather was beautiful and at 75 degrees, who wouldn't enjoy a non-crowded pier? We loved watching the few people present and those fishing. The sun was great and it was incredibly relaxing. We would visit again in a heart-beat!",im4duke
40,Great views!,We really enjoyed are visit to this pier. The views every which way was super. Enjoyed the shops and the variety of food. The pier is quite large and many places to walk and sit in this area.. This was a winter visit so not too many people. Of course go to the pier in Redondo!,thisladyknows
50,"What a place to people watch! Great food, beautiful weather.","Christmas day here as 80 degrees so what was not to love?? Walking on the beach watching the kids play in the ocean, people fishing off the pier and oh all the great places tempting you with great smelling food. A perfect way to spend any afternoon.",glendale215

30,Much Classier Experience than Santa Monica Pier,"Loved the feel of the Redondo Beach Pier, it was laid back and picturesque, but felt over-run with people than other piers in the area. Great place to view the sunset. Many options for dinner, with our favorite for a bargain price, casual restaurant being Corner Pub (amazingly fresh fish n chips!)",justmyopinion1957
50,The pier continues to be a great place to explore,I have been going to the Redondo a Beach Pier for over 60 years. The fire changed it and the redevelopment efforts and building of the harbor change it's character. Yet somehow the pier continues to be a fun place in spite of all the energy that has been spent trying to improve it.,Cavydad
50,Beautiful pier,"If you are int he neighborhood, make time to stop here. it is a breath taking place. My husband and I like to take a casual walk along the pier. easy to find parking and a lot of restaurant in the area for you to enjoy. fun place for everyone.",Alangkw
50,Home Sweet home,"Great family destination. Great things to see. Lots of shops with great souvenirs, good food at reasonable prices, great ice cream and lots of free entertainment. Cocktails at El Torito, Old Tony's and a few of the upscale places. But mostly good family fun. Arcades, Kite Shop. Karaoke and Live Music in the summer.",BorgHouse
50,"Relax, stroll, shop, dine","Each time I visit the Redondo Beach Pier, I enjoy the experience. Parking is available for a nominal rate in the adjoining structure or for free four-five blocks away on the other side of Catalina Avenue. I like to casually stroll along the pier, the upper and lower decks. People may be fishing or dining, children romping, families taking in the coastline view. A few shops sell souvenirs and a variety of items. Restaurants offer fine dining. Several places offer snacks. Lots of benches allow for sitting and relaxing. Regardless of time of year, it is a pleasant place to visit, take photos, relax, stroll shop, dine.",tapbelle

40,Cool Vintage Feel and Great Views,"We've been coming to the RB Pier for years, the shops and style is that of a nostalgic feel. The smell of the ocean and the breeze is worth it alone. Lots to eat and cool bars. Can get a little crowded int he summer, winter was always our favorite time.",The_Wanderlusty
50,Worth a look,"We were staying at Hermosa Beach and walked down to The Redondo Beach area. The pier is an amazing collection of shops and restaurants all sitting over the water. We were there at the end of the season and most shops were closed, however there were still restaurants open all basically serving seafood, so if this is what you like, the sky is the limit. On a beautiful sunny day it is such a relaxing location. We were lucky enough to be there on a Thursday and there was a farmers market, such beautiful fresh fruit, nuts, pop corm, plants for sale. The walk along the beach is a must.",Wardies4
40,Things to do,"I went when they were having a Lobster Festival, so the pier area was packed with things to do. Nevertheless, it had many options in terms of restaurants, a nice marina area and the beach nearby. I didn't get to go to the beach. I liked the Hermosa Beach Pier more than this one, but it was good enough to enjoy several nights after business meetings. Great to see dolphins and sea lions.",mao70
40,Great restaurants and views of the sunset,We enjoyed a beautiful sunset walk on the pier. Great location for photos and dining. We tried to eat at Tony's but they don't take reservations so we went with Kincaid's instead. Even from our table inside Kincaid's we were able to watch the entire sunset. Especially love the convenience of the parking garage right at the pier.,Rutha2s
50,Wonderful Days at the Beach,The pier has benches throughout its length and I sat and read for hours. Much of the pier extends out over the ocean. Beautiful!,C H
40,"Mixed atmosphere, lots of good food and drink","It is a mix - people fish off the pier, and there are chap eateries along with nice restaurants like Tony's. There is parking there. It isn't fancy, but it is nice to be able to look at the ocean and have a beer and/or dinner. There is also a nice little espresso place for coffee and sandwiches or pastries. A boardwalk is available for walking along the water.",ColoradoPlains
40,Good place to kill some time and people watch,"Give yourself a couple of hours at least to walk around and browse. Stop at one of the local eateries or bars. Watch people fish from the far side and see what they bring in. My entire family young children, teens, and adults all had a good time and we have gone back since. If you live north of the area you can bike in.",DachK
40,A great way to stroll around in beautiful surroundings,"My daughter and I just strolled around on a beautiful October day admiring the beautiful views watching the Wildlife, The Fish and The Sea Lions as well as visiting the Seafood Companies with all the live crabs and Oysters on sale, we eventually stopped for lunch at Polly's (separate review) and enjoyed watching the fishermen as we had lunch. Nice and quiet this time of year but gift shops still open. Truly relaxing place to stroll around.",Yorkie1948

40,good for tourists and locals,"This is so perfect for tourists, lots of souveniers and fun little places. Locals like it too because there are some really good places to eat, lots of fresh fish cooked while you wait. Non fish options too at the walk up fast food places. A couple super local bars round of the experience. It is nice to take a walk around the whole pier, watch the fisherman, the local birds, the other tourists.",Yvettetravels
50,Going back when I have more time!,"After visiting Southern California many, many times, this was the first time I went to the Redondo Beach Pier. We usually stayed in the Orange County beach cities. Now, I want to go back!First, it is not the traditional wooden pier like at Huntington, Seal, or Manhattan Beach. It was an entire complex. Marina, shopping, restaurants...or just sit down to relax. My daughter loved looking for the sea lions swimming underneath the pier or watching for dolphins playing in the water (saw both!).Now we need to go back because we saw where you can also rent kayaks and paddle boards...and we want to go out to the buoy straight out from the pier to see the sea lions! The marina is protected from the waves by one of the big rock walls...making this a place to have fun above and beyond walking on the pier!Make sure you get a map to see all there is...there are thing by the marina and by the pier. Parking is pay at the station in a number of public parking areas.We are going back on our next trip!!",WeThreeAdventurers
50,Wonderful place to walk and soak up the smell of the ocean,"After a most hot and uncomfortable summer here in Arizona, we were absolutely thrilled to walk around this area, look at the ocean, listen to the seagulls, and smell the sea. We have friends, who have lived in Redondo Beach since 1967, and they took us there. We could not get enough of the ocean air, and filled our lungs with it. Our friends related to us the history of the Pier and of many of the various businesses. They go to the Fish Market weekly to shop for fresh fish. The Pier feels very spacious and roomy, with ample space for everyone. We saw bike riders, fishermen, children playing, people strolling, bench sitters, roller skaters, etc. No need to worry about being run over, as there is so much room. It was a lovely day (9/10), yet we did need to put on sweatshirts, as the ocean breeze was a bit chilly. We had a lovely lunch at Kincaid's Bay House after our walk.",NYU62

50,Great Pier,The Redondo Beach pier is a really nice place to spend a few hours. the pier has several really good restaurants and the views are amazing. Many years ago the pier had caught fire and about a third of the pier was rebuilt using concrete instead of wood and the restaurants that were lost due to the fire never rebuilt but there are still many good restaurants to choose from.,melsdad2002

Week days are pretty pleasant. The other seasons are great any day. A must stop for drinks or dinner is Tony's. Fair prices and the best Mai Tai's around. Kincads is great for a drink and appetizers outside on the patio. I like breakfast at the end of the fishing pier at Redondo Cafe (never ate there for other meals). Nice views, fair prices. If you are looking for fancy foods, this is not your place. You like beer, I don't, but apparently Najas on the lower pier is a must. El Torito's has great views but the food is a bit over priced for the quality. All in all, you can't really go wrong with a stroll along the pier.",Daphne0801
40,THE PIER,"This is a fun walk-through place. There are several really fine dining restaurants along with many interesting shops and stalls for all kinds of ""carnival"" food. For the most part we visit to go to Kincaid's, but have also taken the kids to the glass bottomed boat and have even gone fishing. We live near by so we visit frequently for dinner. It has a fish smell and is not fancy, but that is part of the charm.",Beachbarb
30,Not So Great,I have lived in Redondo Beach for more then 20 years and unfortunately I never managed to fall in love with the Redondo Pier. I find the restaurants to be mediocre and the shops to all have the same collection of bric-à-brac from the sea shells to the beach signs. I find the pier to usually be crowded and have absolutely no charm.,Claucat
50,Nice way to spend an hour or two.,We stopped at the Pier after working for the day. It was fairly sparse on the beach. Hit up the cold beer and fresh oysters at one of the shops for cheap. Nice place to chill for a while.,mikeahfi
30,If you like Seafood go there,It was a little run down and not alot to choices. Do not like seafood- and did not like the fishy smell. Found a nice place to got a cool drink. Beach was clean- but of course crowded.,Mindy T
40,Beautiful beach and fun times,"The place has changed a little, we have been gone for eight years, so it is bound to change. Love the smells of the beach and carnival food. The fisherman on the pier, cleaning fish. The shops and restaurants with their lights. I love it here at night. It is a little run down but still fun and that might just add to the vintage feel of the place. It has a safe parking structure that is very close to the pier.",JAZEStopp
30,It's not great - but okay...,"Boat rides and paddle boats were available at the pier. Parking was plentiful and pretty reasonable compared to other places we visited. A nice perk was text reminders that your meter was about to run out and you could text back for more time if needed without going back to the parking area.I agree that the pier looks like it has seen it's better days. As far as the arcade (The Fun Factory) it was large and a blast from the past. Kids, and even teens, could have a fun couple of hours here without breaking the bank. My 16 year old enjoyed a few hours here - were we live there are no ""arcades"" left, just overpriced adult centered establishments.There were several eating places offering a variety of food. We had a slice of pizza at the Zeppy's location (which was cash only) that was ok but nothing extraordinary. Several little shops were scattered about offering your standard touristy items for the area. I also noticed a fresh seafood stand - but I didn't purchase anything so I can't comment on that.There were fisherman, and a strong seafood smell in most areas. The views of the ocean from the far side of the pier were nice. There were also many boats docked that you could stroll by. You could also walk over to the beach and take a look around.Smoking is allowed outdoors at this pier and ashtrays are provided.If you're looking for a pristine, upscale, location - this is not the place for you. If you're looking for someplace to stroll around for a few hours, sit and watch the ocean, and let the kids have a little inexpensive fun playing games, you may give it a try. It's nothing fancy and could probably use some TLC, but I personally did not find it ""scary"".If we make it back to the area again, we would probably go back.",CoastalDreamer70
50,great place to walk around,"crack a crab, go fishing, take a boat ride, get a cold beer on tap, its all here. Let your senses come alive by smelling the fresh sea aire, hear the harbor sounds, feel the ocean breeze, rent a bike or go swimming and catch a wave. Its a great ocean experience!",Tyler T
20,Had fun here despite being run down.,Spent the afternoon here. My kids enjoyed the beach and we took a stroll on the pier. There is several shops and restaurants. None of them tempted me to spend any money. I was hoping for more to do but there was not. So we just took a walk and was sightseeing. Parking was cheap. The place is safe but the stairs in the parking garage reaked the high heavens of Urine. I dont think i would go back.,Jesse Tronson
50,Great running pier,"Loved seeing the sea lions and running along the pier! Many restaurants to chose from, however, we didn't eat at the pier.",MaryCPB
30,Run down,"The pier has been here a long time. I agree eith the person who mentioned stinky. We walked past the boats to the fish markets. I cannot believe that the fish is safe to sell, it was a hot day, and while the fidh was on ice,they were not covered with it. They have an outdated arcade with pong and a tilt a whirl ride.",RPVTravelmore
20,Ick,"Instead of spending the afternoon as planned, I walked on the sticky booardwalk, past the cheap and greasy fast-food places, and couldn't wait to get out of there. Overrated.",tammyloans
40,"Nice walk, pretty clean","The pier was a little busy but not bad. There's a nice long walkway along the beach that was level and quite pleasant, with lots of metered parking.",Cands2
50,Great place to walk around and enjoy Redondo Beach,"I grew up here, but have been gone for 15 years. I revisited the pier in mid June and it was not a disappoinment. Great shops, food and arcade. Def a trip down memory lane for me. So happy I got to go while I was back home!",6oddity
50,Great pier!!!!,"The pier is lovely, with a lot of great little restaurants and bars. It has beautiful benches to have a great look at the sea.",JulieBA
30,"Stroll the pier,get ice cream, play arcade games at fun factory","We went on Sunday evening after dinner (teen birthday) to watch the sunset, get dessert, and spend a little time at the ""Fun Factory"" arcade adjacent to the docks/garage. There were still quite a few fisherman there at dusk/sunset. Lots of people enjoying cracked crab and seafood at the seafood restaurants. The ice cream store that we go to has alot of flavors and a good sized banana split which my son enjoyed (take cash only). There are some vendors selling blow-up plastic toys (ie.giant baseball bat) and other balloons, etc. but not alot to see other than restaurants. We walked down to the arcade ""Fun Factory"" where they have skeet ball, basketball hoop games, a few rides (i.e.tilt a whirl) music/dance machine, air hockey and other video & arcade games. There were a few different choices for ticket ""prizes"" but not too much in the way of candy or usable objects for lower level ""prizes"", still there's variety and entertaining",socaltravelmom_fun
40,Eat at the Boiling Shrimp,A lot of food choices here. We had a sumptuous lunch at the Boiling Shrimp. The peel and eat shrimp was delicious,sdpgod
30,"Disappointed, run down","Lot of restaurants and shops , tons of fresh sea food but I don't know if I would eat there. The whole area looked run down and dirty. We went to the souvenir shop to see the shark ""Georgina"" and they charge you to look at a stuffed shark, seriously? , but the youngest child liked it so I guess it was worth it.",biltri m
30,Redondo Pier - ok.,"Visited the pier when looking around this area generally for birds and found it to be very rustic and full of fishermen which attracted herons, seagulls and wading birds. We had coffee and breakfast at a basic cafe and enjoyed the waves (which were very rough on that day). We could here seals under the pier but didnt see any. Very old by the look of it and needed updating; interesting to see though.",fodenman48
30,Love the Pier,Been a while but this is a great place to spend a Sunday afternoon. Not too far to drive to with easy parking and lots to do.,GlendaleGirl1
50,We saw Seals at the Pier on Redondo Beach!,"After my son and I checked into our hotel on Friday, we ran right out to this Beautiful Pier at Redondo Beach, California, it's just an Incredible sight to see! The Pacific Ocean is Amazing! We saw Seals right at the foot of the Pier! Now, that's a sight, pure majestic beauty swimming and giving us our own show! Magic moments! The Pier itself has so many unique shops, restaurants, and souvenir shops. The people in the sand at the ocean end was swimming, paddle boarding, and kite flying! They all were enjoying their beach time! I loved walking on the board walk smelling the salt water, and all the fried foods cooking! Oh Yummy! It truly is a magical place to go when your in Calif. A Must See!",janeandfamily
40,great place to enjoy a nice afternoon,"Great place to hang out with friends. If you want a nice place to relax shop, as well as eat the Redondo Beach pier is indeed the place for you, just a month or so ago it just got refurbished and remodeled and it really looks the best it has ever looked in a long time...",Mahmudur R
40,Pier hangs in there,"Like another review, the potential is there to be a really great attraction. Seems like the economy has had an effect on the area. There are gems of restaurants, great views and a great place for walking. The overall effect though is timeworn and in need of updating.",MumboPetaluma_CA
50,A nice place to go and relax shop as well as eat,"If you want a nice place to relax shop, as well as eat the Redondo Beach pier is indeed the place for you, just a month or so ago it just got refurbished and remodeled and it really looks the best it has ever looked in a long time and they are still doing some work on it now but it is minor stuff and pretty much the pier is looking the best it has ever looked since the remodeling.And if you want something good to eat there are some nice places like you can have fish and chips as well as mexican food pizza, as well as ice cream and anything else that looks good to you while you are there. also there are some nice places to sit and relax while looking at the water and just think about things as well as have a nice quiet moment to yourself. There are also some nice places to shop there they have clothes shops as well as souvenirs up for sale so you can also spend a nice day shopping while you are there. So I highly recommend if you want a nice place to relax shop, as well as a nice place to eat, I highly recommend the Redondo Beach pier in Redondo Beach Ca. where you can just sit and enjoy the wonderful beauty of the ocean and what it has to offer. Thank you so much, Love and blessings.",Jeff B
30,Has a lot of potential!,"You can tell that this pier is struggling. Restaurants have come and gone. But there are a couple of places where the locals go and are ok. We enjoyed walking around the pier and seeing the sights. Checked out happy hour at a sushi place, Mexican restaurant and pub. None of the places you would go to dressed up but each had its own character",Kay B
30,Morning Market worth the trip,"We arrived early on a Weds morning to be pleasantly surprised by the outdoor market. We ended up grabbing a couple Crepe's, and some fruits etc and having a picnic next to the pier. Great way to start the day. Afterwards we walked the Pier and did the usual picture taking. The views of the beach are nice. Don't look the right though, some industrial plant nearby kills the vibe.",kpattison
50,It's a beach,It's a beach and by the way does anybody want to buy my chihuahua from me $0 OBO. I am just kidding but really it's a beach and I love the beach no matter where I am at.,rejuvinateyrslf
50,Perfect for a day at the beach.,Great location! Brought my one year old here for her first visit to the ocean. Loved every second of it. Clean beach with convenient showers and restrooms. Parking was fair. They have covered parking at the pier for I think $1.00/hour. We went in march which was still part of the winter schedule. I know it costs more during the summer. Definitely will come back.,jngrooms
40,Fun and cheap!,"Welcome to Redondo Pier!Playing Pacman for a quarter,air hockey for 75 cents,throwing basket ball next to the ice cream stand;,old arcade games it is old but you know what?! Old can be fun:a lot of good bars next,live music ;fresh oysters or crabs! Have fun!",bobbylake
40,Go (for) Fish!!!,Walk (or roll) around the maze of piers and pick out where you want to eat REALLY FRESH fish and seafood. Beer too.,SP1NDR
30,Showing its age,"Plenty of things to do here, but I have to admit, the pier is showing her age. They've got plenty of bars, arcade area, restaurants and rentals for boats, whale watching excursions, jet skis, etc. Night life here is decent. They have a few bars/ clubs that cater to both older and younger crowds. My fav is def Brixton, although the owner is a bit of a pompous jerk. If I had to choose between RB pier and SM pier, I would def choose this one, as its quieter and def not as packed with tourist. But if you're into that kind of nonsense, by all means, go to Sm. Again, pier is showing her age, they are remodeling the south end, def worth a trip.",mcfly1982
40,Nice Pier,It small but very nice with a nice little mom&pop cafe on it - good breakfast. Great area to walk around with amble parking too; don't forget to get your parking ticket validated if you eat on the pier. Not a lot of people either on this pier unlike the San Monica one.,ribbaz
40,Redondo Beach Pier,"The pier at Redondo Beach is a very uniqe design. The pier forms a triangle with the ocean waves crashing in at the ""V"" of the pier.Old meets new as the spike nailed deck plates have that strudy rustic look that all of a sudden blend in to the concrete walk way.I was there early in the day....the place was just waking up, it was nice. The fishermen on the pier were working hard at fishing, the shops just opening their doors. I had a baileys coffee at ""Tonys"", actully I had two!The Pier itself was very different, the seafood resturants were many, hard to choose. Gotta go back again....",rlashman
50,Must visit!,"You can catch a great sunset, see an amazing amount of vessels, sailboats, motor boats, yachts. There is nothing like water view. Is romantic, charming. Fun for everyone.",MJ778
40,Fun Pier To Visit,Generally this is a fun place to vist. It has alot of stores and places to eat..great location. The hardest part was finding the parking garage. Google brought me to an apartment complex behind the pier..lol.,Steveandlanada
30,On a long walk,"Not as tidy as it could be. They are trying to separate the fishing crowd and the tourist/little shops,but not completely successful to this point.",Mary I
50,Pier of all Piers,The Redondo Beach Pier seems to be one of the largest piers in California. We enjoyed the funky little family owned shops and a nice walk before and after dinner along the pier and adjacent beach. I also discovered that you get a free pearl from Mie Pearl shop on your birthday.,r b
30,It's a pier,"With the typical food stops. Some greasy junkfood and some better restaurants. Tourist trap booths and kiosks, selling the typical beachie stuff abound. Maybe I am too old for this type of place because I have seen so much of it everywhere there is an ocean. So, try it and make you own review.",Bob B
50,Watch Sea Wildlife and Fisherman Co-exist,"It was a great spot. Get a cup of coffee from the cafe on the pier and then stand and watch the serious fisherman compete with the seals, pelicans, and if you are lucky a dolphin or two. Beautiful.",DenverJustengaged
40,weird mixture,"On weekends the pier and fish eateries below it are a zoo and a bit downmarket. but during the week the area is lovely. and yes the harbour area is smelly on weekends - but thats the freshly landed fish. The other half of the pier ir really nice and the beach is lovely. In general Redondo Beach is great place to stay - the restaurants are the best in the area - Blue Marlin, joes crab shack, charterhouse, etc all have wonderful sea views of harbour or beach. restaurants on the pier less good.",merionvw
30,Sea and Air,"It’s fun to walk on the pier to inhale the fresh sea air and listen to the sound of the waves. However, the establishments themselves could use an updating. Lots of tacky joints with only a couple of decent restaurants. A diverse crowd is always in attendance so there is probably an attraction for everyone. My preference is to walk on the beach which is clean and beautiful.",StarLady99
50,Great place....Great food,"Its a nice place to hang out during the evening, I recommend all seafood venue on the pier, taste great if you like deep fried food. Tonys is also nice.",Appelin
30,A little sketchy after dark.,"Fun during the day, but think twice after the sun goes down. Too much panhandling and homeless for me and my family. Tony's is a fun crow's nest to have a drink at, El Torito has seen some better days, Kincade's is awesome. Lots of fun to watch people fishing and reeling in their catch. Parking is easy. Public bathroom stalls have no doors.",Mike90275
40,Always fun,"I love walking to the pier from Palos Verdes. Always fun to take a spin around, watch the fisherman, grab an ice cream. Love the Pelicans!",RebeccaForster
40,Relaxing..Go ahead take a break,"This is a great location to stop what ever your doing & take a break! They have a volleyball nets, lots of places to eat & shop or just sit back & pull out a big blanket & watch the waves do all the work! This was a clean & quiet place to just bird watch & clear your mind. It can be a perfect spot to let the kids get rid of some stored up energy & at the same time be as romantic as you can make it. I had a geat time picking up sea shells & getting my feet wet! We had a nice lunch at Kincaid's Bayhouse the food was off the charts a little pricy $50.00 for 2 meals & dessert (water to drink). We will be going back with a blanket & a basket of our own food to have our own feast! Bring some pocket change its $1.50 a hour to park in the parking garage (they also take credit cards) or you can park off the street by a meter & if you want to walk a bit they do have free public parking the only investment is your walking time of about 10 minutes. Dont forget a camera you WILL want to take photos!",toptravel101
40,Fun Experience,"I can spend a whole day at Redondo Beach Pier. Lots of cute shops and restaurants. Beautiful view of the ocean and Marina. I did not expect that waves came rolling right inside of the pier. Tony's on the pier is a unique restaurant. It has two stories, and the view is terrific, while waves are rolling by the restaurant. Good menu. Kincaid's restaurant has good appetizers. Gambrinus restaurant is very unique. It is primary a Russian restaurant with great authentic menu. The prices are ridiculously cheap for the quality meal. Even caviar is available for an average wallet. Unbelievable. I will never get tired of this hidden jewel. And next to the pier is the Redondo Beach. Come visit beautiful Southern California.",Mila K
40,Good quiet location. At least this time of year !!,A small pier compared to Santa Monica or some of the larger piers. Quiet and clean with some good restaurant choices. Great view of the ocean and a nice sea walk. We ran into a farmers market which had some great pricing on fruit yet expensive seafood. But was obviously very fresh and good quality. A nice stop when on the pacific coast highway.,manium
30,Just OK,My dgt.and I had some time to waste one Saturday mid-morning so thought we could use up a couple of hours at the pier. We had eaten before we went to the pier so there wasn't much else to do. Most of the businesses were restaurants or snack shacks so not much else to do. We enjoyed the wonderful ocean and views but alot of the shops weren't open at 11:30 am. We were in and out in no time. The arcade looked archaic and cheesy. Maybe we were just here at the wrong time.,m0m23rats
50,Stroll down memory lane,Loved the pier when I used to live in Torrance but now live in Tennessee. Went back to visit and there is so much to see and do with great restaurants like Tony's and El Torito. Must get a Churro they are delicious or one of the Hot dogs on a Stick. Great memories. Loved to see the fisherman still catching fish off the end of the pier.,nstadler
50,good walk,This is a very nice place to take a walk in the morning or afternoon. Nice views and friendly people.,Sergio R
40,pleasant stroll along the pier,"The Redondo Beach Pier is delightful to stroll any time of the year. Inexpensive parking is close by or a few blocks away you can find free parking along one of the residential streets. The pier offers views of the Pacific Ocean, people fishing, and strollers. An array of restaurants, cafes and snack places offer a variety of food. Shops include those that sell souvenirs, clothing, kites and even yoyos. On the upper level are businesses, and a cancer support society for patients, caregivers, and survivors. Not too far to the north is the Seaside Lagoon, more restaurants, the power plant, and several hotels. To the south, is the old Redondo Beach Library with its lovely park and a playground for youth.",tapbelle

50,Beautiful and lots to do!,"This is a beautiful pier and has a lot going on... You can go to the beach, walk around, eat, shop, bike ride, etc. They also have events such as food tastings at the restaurants from time to time which are fun! Parking is pretty easy and not too expensive.",Jackie178

40,amazing structure,the pier in redondo is an amazing structure considering during the time we visited it was super windy and cold! but I'm sure the crabs are delicious but we didn't eat there due to the weather. lots of touristy shops and just a nice place to be if you get a chance to go out.,Ylocanabelle
10,dump,this is horrid at present do not waste your time until it has been refurbished there is not much there and it all looks as if needs to be pulled down,hayesone
50,Good times,The pier is a fun experience especially for us as we live at the North end of it. It is a casual stroll to many great restaurants and bars and the fun factory for the kids as well. There are seafood markets with fresh selections everyday. Beautiful views and sunsets. Summer time is very busy so we prefer the off season. Casual and fun!,jeff M

10,Not sure what all the fuss is about,"All in all, our family just didn't really have a good time at the Redondo Beach Pier. Few restaurants that served fairly plain food...limited selections, stuff I could have made at home really. The shopping was not much to call home about either. We went so my daughter could have a little fun as there was an arcade there but the arcade was fairly lame as well. Really old games, and then games where you could win tickets to then later turn in for prizes. Those were fine as usual (skee ball, basketball etc...) however the prizes were absolutely ridiculous. You could get an ash tray for 5 coupons...serisouly, an ash tray. None the less we ate and left quickly...wished we would have went back to Venice Beach or Santa Monica.",Jason

You won´t regret at all to visit this place!",amadorafael
40,Fun day!,"We had a fun afternoon walking the pier. There are many shops and restaurants to stop at along the area. We watched the ocean and ate snacks. I don't believe they allow alcohol on the pier but you can purchase at some restaurants. It is great for couples and families.

30,Fun time for a family walk,"The pier is very busy, but it looks very nice. It is always fun to visit the fishmongers, although the prices are high.

20,Lost its energy,"Back in the day, Redondo Beach Pier was an exciting place to visit, with lots of electricity and family excitement in the air. Tony's On The Pier was one of my mother's favorite places to dine on her trips out west. Alas, the excitement is gone. The electricity is gone. The shops are gone. A ghost of its former self. While a few places are still making a go of it, I'm sorry to say it's no longer on my list of favorite places to go. The entertainment area is still there, but seems dark and no longer taken care of. Not someplace I'd like to stroll on a summer evening. Used to have a friend who lived behind the pier and over the years we spent many an afternoon or evening walking down for dinner or just to walk on the pier. Unfortunately, it's all gone.",GreggL14

40,A legend and a landmark,"I grew up in Redondo Beach and one of the greatest things about the city is the Pier. As a kid I would go there and visit the shops, many now gone having been destryied in the fire back in May 1988. I went and sat on the rocks watching as it burned. The current pier was completed in 1995 and it still has some of those original restaurants and some new ones too. Tiny's is a Redondo Institution, famous for their Clam Choder and seafood offerings. Then for Fast food tehre is a Hot Dog on a Stick and Zeppy's pizza. The newer restaurants El Torito (Newer as in since the rebuild but not new anymore) and it's seport village on the top of the parking structure is great. Then to give you the feeling of safety, Redondo Beach Police put a substation right there at the pier.",travlinpastor

There are huge friendly pelicans standing near the fishermen .Had lunch at Tony's seafood restaurant on the pier had a window table over looking the water. The clam chower is the best and their seafood is so fresh.There are quite a few other restaurants and it was Thursday and they had a farmers market in the next block. You can park in the parking lot next to the pier.,Bridgetpianos
50,One of my favorite boardwalks!,I have happy memories here at Redondo Beach! Enjoyed picking my own crab or lobster for lunch and had fun in their arcade and kitschy souvenir shops. Great parties in the apartments right on the beach oh and the beach itself and the relaxing strolls overlooking the ocean! Fun times!,intheraw
50,Great place to meander,"the unique shape of the pier, which surrounds a small beach, is definitely something to come check out!",cbucka
30,Kinda run down,Looked kinda aged and run down. There were reconstructing the brick walkway amongst the shops so I am sure some of it will look better when it is done. There is a lot of shopping it has potential just needs some refurbishing,Electrichic
40,Shops & eating places within walking distance of our hotel,We only walked around but enjoyed the shops and has some really nice places to eat!,Elaine060
30,Family Friendly Beach at Redondo Beach,We stopped here while visitig friends. It is a great family beach. Get there early to get the parking at meters!,Suntraveler1977
40,Great People watching on 4th of July,"The combination of tourists and local families enjoying the beach on holiday made for a fun atmosphere. Parking can be expensive. Walking the strand, and joining in a pick-up game of volleyball is great.",Bill J

50,fisherman watching,"I've invented a new spectator sport, and its called fisherman watching---no ticket needed. Since my second job being a commercial fisherman in Hawaii, my first job being a Doctor, we went to the Redondo Pier to watch the activity for a few hours. From inside the restaurants there, being served meals on a comfortable seat we could watch all the local families attempt to catch the fish off the pier. It was so comfortable and satisfying.",drfish2000

40,Well worth a visit,We enjoyed our stay at Redondo beach. The pier has loads of shops and places to eat but is also a nice place to visit just to chill and look out to sea. There is something for everyone.,walshy1160
50,Relaxing,"We could sit and watch the waves, people, and the sun go down forever. It was my husband and I and two of our young adult daughters . The pier is nice and the beach is great.It was cool at night and you will need a sweater or jacket, especially if you are from the south like us (TEXAS). California weather really cools off in the evening.But the sun going down is beautiful, just keep a jacket close by.",swalkerd
40,"Stinky, smelly, and terrific","This is an old mainstay from my youth. Dirty, stink, smells of the ocean, but filled with fishermen, tourists, people enjoying the boardwalk and fresh seafood. The air is filled with scents of fresh crepes and ice cream in the summer, and you can see pelicans and seagulls waddling around.The old pier burned down and has been rebuilt with a beautiful concrete boardwalk engraved with whales and other sea scenes.I love looking at the tanks and tanks of live crustaceans, listening to the squeals of laughter coming from the arcade, checking out if any of the fishermen caught any fish, and strolling along the myriad of shops, bars, and restaurants.Always a fantastic place to watch the waves crashing against the rocks and gaze out at the glittering blue sea.",I-Lin L
10,Dirty,Dirty pier - no way I would eat anything from any of the shops on this pier. Has an arcade but was closed the night we were there.,Lisa W

40,many places to go in the pier,Pier is always busy with many restaurant and bars to go to,Alfredo L
50,Great for (very) fresh seafood!,Relaxed laid back atmosphere. Plenty of places selling fresh (live) sea food. Najas Place (sports bar) has an unbelievable variety of draft beers.,M J
30,It was alright,"Redondo Pier was okay, but nothing to write home about; however, my opinion could be swayed if it would have been good weather while we were there, but it was windy in cold so many places were not open for business.",Love u
30,Past its prime,"The Redondo Pier is somewhat dumpy and the collection of shops selling tacky items is what you might expect from the '50s. There are a couple of restaurants worthy of a visit, most notably Kincaids and Nadja's is worth a stop to sample one of the too numerous beer selections.",deepsee1
40,Fun,"Lots to do with underground parking, shops, fresh cooked seafood, paddle boats, curio shops, lots to walk and see.",ronniwho
50,Not sure the name of the cafe,I had teh best fish tacos at the cafe at the end of the right side of the pier. This place was great!,havinfunlovin
40,Feels like vacation,"I don't live far from the Pier, but somethings magical happens when I go there. I feel like I am on vacation, perhaps on the Boardwalk in Atlantic City. Which, BTW, I've never visited. The mellow vibe at the Pier sooths and relaxes me. I guess the negative ions from the waves help too. Whatever it is, I like it. Note to self: go there more often.",magicalpam
40,family fun,"nice walk over the beach pier, on sundays lots of live music, a lot of restaurants and bars. also for kids a lot of fun in the machine hall",gerard601
10,Childhood memories to stay just that :(,"As children my siblings and I spent every summer at the Redondo Beach pier. Endless hours in the Fun Factory Arcade,fresh crab on the pier, hot crunchy churros in the cold evenings. Delicious food at El Toritos, the sites of people fishing off the pier and eyeing the catch of the day, sea gulls flying above our heads catching the pieces of bread crumbs tossed aimlessly towards their beaks, picking oysters from the oyster man and seeing our treasure as he shucks the shell open to reveal it's prize, endless hours playing in the water digging up sand crabs...today the pier has seen better days. The parking structure is crumbling around the edges, the pavement is broken up and much needed work is being done( now? During summer?) many stores closed up and leave behind only happy reminders of better days gone by. Local drunks fill the taverns where once happy families ate their fish and chips and enjoyed ice cream cones. Most souvenir shops empty with tired trinkets and shop owners only to happy to close early. As kids we stayed till the pier closed, now I was hesitant to stay any longer then the sun setting. Sketchy people fill the pier as well as the homeless who come out at night to secure their spots by the warmth of the heated fans along the businesses. Over to the right of the pier with enough distance to make you feel safe from The goings on of the pier, is Kincaids restaurant. A fine dinning steak and sea food restaurant. Peering through the large glass window you will see happy, mostly Anglo Saxon families dinning without a care in the world unaware (or maybe aware) of the scene that lays just 100 ft away......",Vida67
30,very fishy,"I should start by saying the pier was under construction when we went. I'm sure it's probably more fun and easier to get around normally. We went to the fish market which our girls really loved. The smell was horriable but what else do you expect when your at a fish market,lol. It had alot of different fish to look at and they even got to try a fish kaboob but I don't recommend them. The fish market was about the only thing we really enjoyed. The shops weren't that good and they didn't have a whole lot to look at. It would still be worth a visit if you were in Redondo Beach though.",BigBransonLover
30,Seafood anyone?,"A place if you want to come out with your family, hang out, crack crab, drink beer and just chill out on a Sunday. A fun experience.",questionsc
40,Yum,"Tony's Restaurant is great - right on the water. Excellent seafood choices, although this is a treat as it is a little expensive.",Yesndeed
30,"Not terrible, not great","The pier was under construction when my husband and I visited for the first time. There's not a lot of shopping choices and it was mostly the typical, junky tourist gifts.We went on Mother's Day because there was an ""Art Walk"" which was relatively small and unimpressive. With it being Mother's Day, I believe it was way more crowded than it normally was. We wanted to try the Mexican Restaurant there but there was a two hour wait. We then decided to try the fresh crab/lobster/shrimp at the Vietnamese restaurant, and literally we waited 20 minutes with 6 people in front of us and we gave up as there was still 4 more people by the time we left. We decided to have some fun and get a funnel cake at the fast food place near the opening of the pier. The man was very rude to us although the funnel cake was good.We were hungry and ended up at Kincaid's which is a different review in and of itself.It was neat to see the fishers fishing and the bait shop near the end of the pier was interesting. The pier has a carnival-like feel with the cheap food options (which smelled great!), the gift carts with flowers and small trinkets, the touristy shops, etc. I actually enjoyed the older, beat up wood on the pier because I think it adds character. I would recommend a different pier for a more modern feel but I'm sure this place is nice when it's not super crowded.One complaint: PARKING! Everywhere it seems you have to pay for parking so we parked in a neighborhood nearby and walked about three blocks. The bathrooms were also yucky but what do you expect at a beach pier?",Michelle907

20,Not so nice,"Without sounding too judgemental, I am shocked every time I go to Redondo Pier. Mostly overweight people stuffing their faces with the ubiquitous junk food (not exaggerating), wrappers and trash litter the pier and nearby beach... It's a carnival-ish circus-ish type atmosphere. I just don't enjoy it at all and I live nearby. I go to Manhattan or Hermosa.",Laura W
40,Seafood fun,"Spent the day here and it was awsome, ate fresh crabs that I picked from the tank and they cooked it for me, there is something for everyone to do.",Maggie358
40,"Fun, Fun, Fun","This is almost a 24-hour spot to visit durng the warmer season. Fishers love this pier and there are restaurants, clubs, trinket shops, hot dogs and cotton candy. Lots of self-pay parking; enter by Torrance. Easy walk north to Hermosa and Manhattan or south to Palos Verdes.",Zoom_Gotti

30,Nice to visit once,"A couple of little shops, restaurants and take out eateries. Would have like to see more shops that weren't just tourist gear shops. The little jewelery shop was very interesting and fun to visit with a nice selection of easily affordable and higher end products. More shops that cater to a range of buyers would be nice. The restaurants seem to sell cuisine cooked from frozen products, If I had found a couple of restaurants that provide fresh cooked cuisine including the vegetables and the appetisers not just the lobster's in the tank, and I would have dined at the Pier.",Brenna W
50,Amazing Arcade!!,"One of the best old-school arcades that I've EVER been to. We spent a lot of time and money getting to Santa Monica the day before so that we could hit the arcades there. Not worth it! The arcade at Redondo was much bigger, it was nearly empty, and games were only $0.25! A dozen air hockey tables. Twenty or so skee ball lanes. And arcade games that I haven't seen in years, including all of my old favorites: Terminator II, TMNT, Street Fighter, etc. Tons of bizarre old arcade items to be seen. Check out my photo of the weird puppet show machine. They even have an indoor tilt-a-whirl. If you go during the summer, there are a ton of hole-in-the-wall places to get food. The bigger restaurants are kinda lame.",D-J-Naz
50,This venue is just a short jog down the beach from my place. There always seems to be something different going on there,"Well, it's no really wild; not really amazing; but it is a very pleasant destination to visit when you are in the neighborhood. There seem to be lots of different things going on there whenever I've had a chance to visit. All I can say is try it yourself and see what you think!",amercorp
30,Wood is not sufficiently stable,"The RB Pier (or Fisherman's Wharf) is still the same now as it was 40 years ago when I was a kid. Still the corndog stand, the Tony's and the fisher-men/-women. But the whole place feels like it could come falling down with another big storm. What is perhaps in the most weakened state is the second floor structures. The restaurant that has changed hands many times, has continued to leak organic matter out the backside of the building; the courthouse is now gone, and the drivers who whirl past in cars going too fast because they are not accustomed to pedestrians, as they park for Kincaids. No one is given tickets because rarely is there police presence inside the mini-police station anymore.",Dayla S
40,great place to walk around,go to tonys and there is a good mexican restaurant name of which I forget just to left of old tonys as you face tonys...i think it is upstairs.,Rubyella
50,Relaxing,Redondo Pier is unique and more relaxed than some of the other piers in LA.,pharmland
30,Schizophrenic,"The pier is a mix of old and new, of genuine fish markets and fish restaurants that are iconic places in Redondo mixed in with newer and tacky tourist places.  Can't figure out what El Torito is doing on the pier but it's been there for awhile.  Most of the fish served is deep fried, but go to Tony's or Quality Seafood for a real old Redondo treat.If you're there between December and March, hop on a Voyager Excursions boat to see the whales and dolphins -- a great few hours leaving from the pier.",StarryNight01
50,Seafood Frenzy!,"Red Lobster who? If you don't mind eating outside, you should visit Redondo Beach. You buy your seafood by the pound.

The pier has a diverse range of restaurants, Italian, Mexican, Korean, Chinese, American. On eof my favorite spots is Naja's right next the boats on the pier. They have over 1000 beers from around the world, and the food is pretty good too . . . Redondo Beach in the South Bay attracts a diverse population of races, you'll see the world there . .",Robert A

30,average Beach PIer,"compare yourself, go to Hermosa, Redondo and Manhattan Beach and decide yourself",climax56
30,"Fun atmosphere, but a bit dated.","Interesting pier that has joining sections so that you walk out on one and back on another. The businesses were dated looking, and it was sad to see signs on the pier warning you of the 8 or so species of fish that you might catch, but shouldn't eat! My biggest complaint is the bathrooms; men's room had no doors on toilet stalls and it felt like a prison. If you want strange company when doing your business, this is the place. Really disgusting and unnecessary, in my opinion. Charge a dime and give m,e a door, or at least have one bathroom with an attendant and doors. Give people their humanity back.",Bill A

40,Good for a couple of hours,"There are a lot of places to eat. The kids love to play games at the arcade. Sometimes there are bands playing. It's nice to take a leisurely walk around. It's a good place to kill a couple of hours. Don't bother wearing a bathing suit. It's not that kind of beach. If you want to swim, surf, or ride bikes, go to Manhattan Beach. You can buy a kite on the Pier, but need to go somewhere else to fly it.",SeaJenniTravel

Starboard Attitude and Top of Tony's for drinks and karaoke - several good restaurants, to include Kincaid's which is excellent, and a lot of other fun stops. But make sure to go up to the north end, and downstairs along the ""International Boardwalk"" for some of the most fun! There's a retro arcade for the kids, Quaulity Seafood restaurant for great fresh fish and live crabs, and lobsters, and beer, all enjoyed on picnic tables right by the sailboats! Then there's Naja's -- a rocking' bar with 80+ beers on tap, and Gambrinus has some great russian beers and appetizers. All-in-all, a fun place to spend a few hours.",ISWizards

40,Blue Whale Watch at Redondo Beach Pier,"The blue whales are back!!! It's the second year in a row they are gracing the Redondo Beach area. It's awesome! The ocean temperature has been cooler than normal for the second year in a row which brought the krill which brought the blue whales. I took the Voyager Boat trip (65 feet long) from the Redondo Pier, a 3-hour trip for only $25 on a nice clean and safe boat. The captain did a great job of getting us as close to the whales as possible. They have to stay 100 yards away. We also saw hundreds of dolphins all jump and having fun. The blue whale is the largest mammal in the world. Its length is 85 to 105 feet and they are graceful. They have to surface to get air, but are able to stay under for 8-12 minutes and then they blow the water. We were able to see it several times today.",RockettWriter
40,Great place- Great Food,"A terrific place to go for fresh seafood, pier fishing or just to watch the sunset. Large concrete pier with a separate fishing area so you don't have to walk thru the fishy odor. You can lean on the side without getting fish guts on you. Lots of restaurants and ice cream shops. Enormous arcade room with midway games. Plenty of parking in the garage just make sure you pay the parking fee before returning to your vehicle. You can rent a fishing pole $8 for the entire day.My family and I enjoyed it so much we came here every evening. A great place to walk.",ObjectiveUnknown

So you can take in for the day a great attraction by the ocean. So when you come into the area of Torrance and Redondo Beach don't forget to visit the Redondo Beach pier and come have something to eat take in the ocean, and just relax by the waterfront and as well as take in the Beach too. It is a great place to come to and just relax by the water.",happyjeff56
