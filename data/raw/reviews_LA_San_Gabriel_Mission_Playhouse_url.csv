50,Historic venue.,Excellent location to see a performance. Every seat has a good line. The staff is very friendly. Parking is convenient.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidlF4386MM
40,"Gorgeous historic building, great acoustics, close parking, tedious entry process.","Twice I've been here for performances and twice the shows have started almost 30 minutes late. There HAS to be a better way to get people into the theatre - more doors? More scanning stations? More than one window for will-call? That said, the courtyard and fountain area are lovely and make the wait to enter at least livable.The seats are horribly uncomfortable (too small and too cramped) and the space between rows is cramped and uncomfortable. Next time I'll pop for side box seats. This gorgeous theatre can make the experience so much more enjoyable with a few upgrades to the entry and seating experience. And worst sin of all? Never again will I sit in the back row and subject myself to endless chatter from the venue staff DURING the performance. Oh, and the website for ordering tickets? EEEEEEEEEK! Find a local intern who can help with that. And tell the staff to STFU during a performance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GrannyPottyMouth
20,Pitiful Nutcracker,"Wow. Where to even begin. We came up from LA to see the Nutracker based on recommendation and it waffled between clunky, embarrassing and terrible. The sound track was tinny, one dancer was geriatric with a torn costume they fixed with what looked like duct tape. The dancing was mediocre and the theater not well maintained. Skip this and go to Royce Hall. Really really bad.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/910kerrym

50,"Love, Love",We attending a film here put on by the Los Angeles Conservancy. It’s a new venue this year for their Last Remaining Seats film event held each June.

50,"A beautiful auditorium, with parking!",I like to attend events here because of the beauty of the building and auditorium. The parking is easy. Street parking and a pay lot. They have a wide variety of programs during the year. Many different organizations rent the auditorium.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CASanMarino
40,A Beautiful Gem of a Theater!,"This theater is located just blocks away from the historical San Gabriel Mission. With so much character and beautifully designed Spanish architecture, you will have a great theatrical experience. Every seat in the house is a great seat! Throughout the year, there are numerous productions for all ages. There is ample parking. Some you have to pay for. Across from coffee shops and restaurants. Arrive early so you can taken in the beauty of this gem of a theater. I recommend, The Nutcracker!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mariannem978

40,"An attractive historic Playhouse in San Gabriel, California.",Sadly the Mission Playhouse was closed when I visited on 25th July 2016 but the outside of the building is still very attractive and the decor of the arches by the front doors is lovely. There is also a nice fountain in front of the Playhouse making it very photogenic. Completed for the 1927 season this Playhouse was built to enable John Steven McGroaty to show the world his 'Mission Play'. Certainly worth a look if visiting San Gabriel.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Roberts69
50,A treat for the eyes!,"The mission playhouse has been one of the most beautiful theatres in the Los Angeles area. The interior is gorgeous, and has been used in films. A special treat is yhe old Wurlitzer triple horseshoe pipe organ that raises up from the orchestra pit. I used to see Gaylord Carter perform accompaniment to silent film revivals there (he did the pipe organ music for ""The Haunted Mansion"" ride at Disneyland, and I suspect that it was recorded here).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tenringer
40,Classic Historical Theatre,"This is a beautiful old historic theatre, part of the city's civic center, and walking distance to the SG Mission.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ninja920
50,"Impressive Spanish Colonial arquitecture, built by an Anglo who fell in love with the Mission","John Mc Groarty fell in love with the San Gabriel Mission back in the 19th century; he wrote the Mission Play and, since he was an architect, he built this beautiful building, a mixture of white mission style, with an interior out of his trips to Spain and the fantasies that they created in his mind. The result is not kitsch, but intriguing. He was one of the famous Anglos who came to S. California and fell in love with the mission-land: Don Benito (Benjamin Wilson), Don Miguel Blanco (Michael White), the Patton who married into one of the Rancheros families (like the founder of Azusa, like Don Benito too). This was the alternative life-style to the Puritan East Coast.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MariaM234
50,Nutcracker show during Chrismas,"Very nice place, historic and pleasant. Parking was easy and close to the playhouse. Many restaurant around the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeffd2000s

50,One of the best historic theaters in California,"Completed in 1927 and one of the few theaters built to house one specific show, The Mission Play, this is a beautiful theater and seeing anything here is joy. The interior is a mixture of Spanish, Moorish, and Mexican architecture reflecting the history of the region. At just under 1500 seats it is not so big that you get lost and there are near perfect acoustics and unobstructed sight lines from every seat. One of the joys of this house is the Wurlitzer Hope Jones Unit Orhestra (pipe organ) restored to glory in the early 1970's. The organ has a warmth and resonance that are heard at full potential in this beautiful setting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KB6CLA
