50,A must-visit for any baseball fan,Had a great time sitting in the first row of the upper deck. Great site lines. It was HOT (we went in August). Lots of concession choices. Parking was easy. Got tickets for way under face value on stubhub.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelcP4837WE
50,Definitely go,Special place . Our tour guide was brilliant. Made the day . Dodgers are so lucky to have him . 10/10,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/markoK1236QH
50,Excellent night out in a friendly crowd,"The stadium is well organised and easy to get to. The seating blocks are well signposted. The stadium has lots of different food outlets and cute things to buy. The gift shop is inside the stadium. The crowd around us were friendly, they are obviously used to having tourists attending the games.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/queenr0ck
40,I wish I could dodge those high prices!,I mean it's Dodgers' Stadium ... amazing experience ... cross it off the bucket list ... but damn $18.00 dollars a beer .. whew!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/synseer7
50,90 minutes tour,Its amazing experience for baseball fans!! You are able to see all the achievement and history about the arena,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jindrawati
20,"Glad to have gone, won't hurry to return.","We are working our way thru the MLB ballparks and were in Southern California to catch the teams down there. We really didn't enjoy our time at Dodger Stadium for a number of reasons. Traffic was UNBELIEVEABLE the evening we were there and we struggled finding the park. We didn't arrive until the 4th inning which is not our norm, we always see the whole game. Parking was a disaster as there was very little left and certainly not accessible parking that we needed. I dropped off my elderly dad at a gate, I parked and hoofed it back. Our seats were in the upper deck and getting up there was no easy feat. there were SO MANY STAIRS, and the park employees were unable to tell us if there was an elevator available. Our seats were fine but the crowd in the park that evening seems quite rough. We did have a Dodger Dog for dinner. it was fine but nothing to get excited about. Getting out of the stadium was a very long walk and any accessibility assistance (golf carts to cars) post game had a 45 min wait. We took our time and walked. Overall, we just didn't have a great experience and wouldn't hurry back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Betsyat240
50,"We did the Stadium tour, and it was amazing.","Being a Dodger's fan my wife and i were eager to check out the Stadium with a Stadium tour. For only 20 dollars per person, you get a fabulous deal. Our very knowledgeable guide led us on a very fascinating tour, into the press box, where you could almost hear Vin Scully, through to the locker rooms, the dugout, onto the field. You could look up and imagine what it's like, with a full house packing the stadium. We saw a great collection of Dodger memorabilia, reproductions of tickets to the stadium (25 cents for a bleacher seat!!), gold gloves, and a whole slew of other great memories.A must see for you Dodger fans, and even if you aren't, it's a great look inside the third oldest stadium in the major leagues.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GroomLeader
30,Don't try to visit off-season...,"Pulled up to the gates on January 2, just to get out of the vehicle and take pictures.Well, the security guard said that was not possible. Really!! We are there, at 9am-Nobody trying to get in- we didn't ask to get in- just get out and take pictures and be on our way. NO WAY!! Luckily, another guard there helped us out. He told us about a little league baseball team's field that overlooks the stadium. We googled it, bishop canyon, home of northeast Los Angeles little league team, and drove there. Awesome views!!Would still like to attend a game at dodger stadium, but won't try to visit offseason",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidn0209
50,Dodgers the easy way,If you like Baseball and the Dodgers but want to save yourself some trouble - Take the bus from Union Station. The buses get their own lane to the top. There are many buses so you don't wait long to egt there or to get back. This way you miss the tedious traffic getting up to the stadium and a quick out when the game is over.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K4110DTroberth
50,Sitting in the dug out.,"We did the basic stadium tour and it was great! James was an incredibly knowledgeable guide and made it entertaining for a non-baseball person. I got tix as a gift for my partner. She LOVED it. Went in the press box, to the private boxes, on the field, in the dug out. Saw lots of memorabilia. Fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Seattlekatieh
30,worst tour guide ever,"Took a tour of the stadium. Great stadium, a lot of history and very beautiful. The tour guide made the experience very dull. She had no personality and kept saying about how they should have won the world series in the past few years. Rather than being sad or trying to make a joke of it, it would've been better to just not mention it. At the start of the tour she asked everyone except my fiance and I where they were from so she could get a feel of how to tailor the tour. Everyone was local except for us so maybe had she asked us it would've been a little better...?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/angieee515
50,Best scenic ballpark,"Before our last visit to Dodger Stadium, it had been over 30 years since my last visit there. It's still an impressive ballpark and the scenery behind the outfield seats is amazing. We attended a Dodgers game against the San Diego Padres and the Dodgers lost. Since I am a Yankee fan, that made me happy. Leave early to get to a game, because it's a real pain in the neck getting there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HOCKPOOH
50,MAGICAL DODGER STADIUM,Spent many a day and night at Dodger Stadium over the years. The stadium never gets old and the history and memories are amazing. So many great and historic events here and so many fun and exciting games seen. Time for a Dodgers world series win ... long overdue now !!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gerryg868
50,Beautiful stadium in a great location for both baseball and non-baseball fans,"We came here in November, well after the baseball season was over. You can come to the souvenir shop and they let you walk into the stadium and view it from the top section. You have a great view of the stadium from behind home plate. We were there on a nice clear day and we could see the mountains in the distance with snow on top. From the entrance to the gift shop and from the parking lot, you have a great view of downtown Los Angeles. Well worth a trip whether you are a baseball fan or not.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/875jl
50,dream come true,"As I used to play baseball before a broken arm put an end to it, it has always been a dream to see a major league stadium and it did not disappoint.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PaulW6757
50,Most beautiful baseball park in America.,"Beautiful home of the LA Dodgers is nestled in the hills. Every seat is a good seat and Dodger Dogs are a must have treat,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/valleysteve
50,Great Tour!,"Our guide was extremely knowledgeable and even made this non baseball fan get excited and enjoy herself. The fact that the stadium is on a hill makes for some fantastic views, especially of the Hollywood sign. You get to see many awards the Dodgers have won over the years and even have access to the press box and the field. I would definitely recommend this tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/angelbear425
30,Dodger game.,"Good promotions. The stadium is good looking on the outside, but dirty on the inside. Fans usually drunk & loud.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Padrefan101
50,"AMAZING ATMOSPHERE, GREAT STADIUM, ONCE IN A LIFETIME EXPERIENCE!","We were on vacation in California and on our bucket list was to ""visit a Dodger's game"" and we're so glad we did!We booked tickets in advance (pretty much as soon as they were released) and had some of the best in the house. They ended up costing around $100 each but were so worth it.The stadium itself is full of energy, there is such a great vibe and it's exactly how it looks on TV and in films etc. As well as watching a fantastic game by the Dodgers and getting to see all of the players on the pitch, we also loved the in between game entertainment.There are lots of food trucks/stands and merchandise stools to visit so arriving early helps! Also, if you visit the customer service counter and tell them it's your first Dodger's game, they give you a free badge saying ""first dodgers game"" which was a great souvenir to take home with you and keep forever!The stadium food is massively overpriced (like any sport stadium) but the food is tasty (albeit junk food). There were also plenty of toilet stops and the toilets were very clean.Overall we had a fantastic experience and would visit again should we be in LA.Instagram: @journeywithuss",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/journeywithuss
50,Timeless park,"Although it isn't as old as Wrigley Field or Fenway Park, Dodger Stadium holds up as a architectural and cultural landmark just as well as either of those two hallowed baseball cathedrals.While both Wrigley and Fenway were period pieces of the early years of baseball, Dodger Stadium is a cultural lodestar of the early days of the suburban/automobile culture that emerged after the Second World War. Built outside of downtown, Chavez Ravine is an idyllic natural setting in which to watch a game.The stadium itself is a period piece, with muted pastel blues, narrow concourses and the building elements of an earlier age. None of this diminshes the quality of the experience, mind you; a series of renovations plus the purity and excellence of the original vision make this an excellent place to watch baseball, with clear sightlines and fine amenities available for fans.There are a range of excellent options for food and drink but I chose to stick to Dodger Dogs as they are every bit as good as their most fervent fans say. Prices are high but that's true of all of Los Angeles. We opted for Ubers and left early; their system for managing the flow is good and if you have the option it's a lot easier than driving oneself.Loved Dodger Stadium - looking forward to going back if I'm so lucky.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MKB1701
10,Overpriced tickets not a family environment,Ticket prices increased dramatically last two years Dodgers are selling their tickets through aftermarket ticket agencies instead of having same tickets at the box office if you take a Uber or Lyft to the ballpark they drop you off at a desolate part of park where you must walk a long way to get to where you enter the park where in the the past you could just have the driver drop you off where your drop off point was,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/krisblanton
40,Baseball History,Great place to spend an afternoon watching America's Pastime. A great variety of different food. A huge variety of gifts for Dodger fans!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yodaesq
50,Dodger Stadium - Ballpark Tour,"Whether you are a Dodger fanatic or generally interested in the game of baseball, you won't want to miss your opportunity to take a tour of baseball's third-oldest stadium, with one of their friendly and knowledgeable guides.This 90 minute, small group tour, lets fans go behind-the-scenes and visit some of the most restricted and non-public areas, and view the stadium from a whole new perspective.Some of the highlights include, visiting the Dodger Dugout, taking a trip down to the Field, taking a look at Lexus Dugout Club, VIP Restaurant and Lounge (home to their World Series Trophies), Media Room and much more! It is a unique opportunity to experience the ballpark from the perspective of the players!** Photography is permitted for personal use only; video however is not encouraged.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/_maka1620
50,Wonderful Visit,I'm sure that it helps if you are a baseball fan. I found it to be wonderful. They give you an overview of the stadium at Chavez Ravine and then take you into rooms where trophies and memorabilia are displayed. Then they take you down to the field and the player dugouts. I found the whole thing great. One caution - The tour requires entrance through Gate A. Our GPS took us to other gates that were closed and we had a hard time finding our way. So be sure to specify Gate A if using GPS.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T1944CKjohnt
50,Beautiful Background View,"We visited Dodger Stadium in September. The fans were a lot of fun. We arrived early to get a decent parking place. Once inside we hunted the main fan store, which is on the top floor. We have a special-needs son, and an usher called for an elevator for us and we were treated so well. The elevators are for handicapped and service. Everyone was very nice and we found what we wanted. It is an older stadium with fewer escalators, lots of stairs. Our seats were easy to get to, again very nice ushers in place to help everyone. The view behind home plate to the outfield is gorgeous. The mountain range in the background is so nice. This was our 27th ballpark - we enjoyed it. We did leave after the 7th, even though a fairly close game - and we were out of the parking lot in record time without problem. My nephew who lives there had suggested that, and we did have an early flight the next morning.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TigerHeart25
40,Game time,"Awesome time, from parking attendant to bartender everything was fantasticThe food was great the drinks delicious",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/artmarin29
50,Awesome Experience!,"So, you’re enjoying a Kettle One Peach Vodka and soda on a perfect evening watching the Boys in Blue hammer some poor team into submission, and you think, it doesn’t get any better, but then Turner jacks one into the left field stands and 52,000 of your new best friends go nuts! That is The Dodger field experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/921craigh
30,Catch a game,"If you are in the area, this is a fun stop. Great atmosphere. Garlic fries are to die for. Expect to walk, lots of parking lots.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tiffanybrasch
50,Did the Tour then the Game,"SO MANY PEOPLE for the game, well oiled machine. Excellent views and experience for a loud game with tons of fans.Also did the tour, led by Jonathan, which is A++. Only $20 and able to see press box, and sat in the Dodgers dugout. Unreal!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robby321
50,LA Dodgers,"I didn’t think I’d enjoy a game of baseball like I did, what an experience, the dodgers and the Phillies put on a show and it’s was great. Whether you are into sports or not, definitely recommend a game and a hotdog at dodger stadium.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sm232
50,Great night at the stadium,Really enjoyed the entire experience. Made it in time to watch warm ups. Visiting the area and never been to this stadium before. We had a great time with everyone around us. Had Dodger Dogs for dinner - very tasty.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/297PaulaL
40,Most expensive stadium beer ever,This was truly an experience. I have never seen such a packed baseball stadium other than the Yankees. Fans were there to enjoy the day and have good clean fun. Felt safe at all times. We went with teens and young kids and everyone had the best time. The dodger dogs are good but messy so grab extra napkins. The beer was over the top expensive. They also had Moscow mules which I didn’t try but the cup was a souvenir which looked really nice. One of the most enjoyable baseball games I’ve ever watched.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lindarplusfour
50,Professional Sports-Los Angeles,"What can one say about Dodger Stadium but that it continues to evolve and improve as time goes on? Over the years there has been an expansion of different food and drink offerings, from Italian to Chicken and Waffles and barbecue as well. Always consistently well maintained, courteous staff and always an enjoyable experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anthonygW9228EC
40,Older stadium,"Enjoyed the baseball atmosphere. First time visit, challenge finding our seats, but we got a self guided tour of the stadium!! Lots of baseball history here! Enjoyed the typical hot dogs and cold beer!! Glad we saw the stadium/ball game!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jsrd
50,Experience not to be missed,We watched LA Dodgers v San Francisco Giants at the stadium. Arrived what we thought was early (11:30 for a 1:10 game) and the place was buzzing. It is apparently the biggest baseball stadium in the US and is a spectacular place to visit for not only the fame but also just for the atmosphere. Dodgers won with a couple of spectacular home runs so a great time was had by all. The Dodger dogs should not be missed and beware the heat of the afternoon it can be cruel so go prepared.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EdD836
50,Great view- Cool Park,Went mid week to a game. The stadium is dated a bit- but that plays to some of the fun. The hotdogs were good- and the beer was cold. Easy to see the game from most seats.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/twm83
30,Tired stadium,"Not the prettiest or most updated stadium, but we still had a good time. Limited food court selections, (I am spoiled by Citifield). Be warned the parking lots are laid out in the oddest fashion.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sagc333
50,Baseball LIVE!,"Many years have past since the last Major League game I have attended. Travel too Dodger Stadium was not bad coming from the Fresno CA area to a 7:10 PM game. We had very good seats in the area behind home plate, row M. Have to say our tickets were free so do not know the cost. I see some post about Tickets for around 15.00. Looks as if many good seats in the upper decks. Seeing Baseball Live is much better then seeing on TV! Yes I am a Dodger fan! They will get you on Parking cost along with any food or drinks you buy. There is much personnel around to direct you to your parking area. We missed our so had to do the round a bout. You can drop a hundred, real quick for two people to have a couple drinks, Dodger dog, fries and coke ( no refills for 7$). Still enjoyed the game/atmosphere very much!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/660kennethc
50,A trip down memory lane,"I'm a native Angeleno and bleed Dodger Blue, but I haven't lived in L.A. since 1984 and hadn't been to a game since June 2006. The cheapest seats are still eminently affordable ($14 in the top deck behind the plate for a Wednesday afternoon game) and I discovered that programs at MLB games are now handed out free of charge. They get you on the beer prices at the concession stands (a pint of Estrella Jalisco was more expensive than my actual ticket by 75 cents) but to this day there is no ballpark where I enjoy myself more than the home of my Boys in Blue.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joecF6695JN
30,Nice stadium but like a dated Disney park,A nice place to see a game but parking is $30 and to get into the stadium you have to go to where your seats are on a certain level. This can be a pain in the neck as you may have to go almost 1/2 way around the ballpark on the outside up many stairs and its a long way around. Inside was OK for a big park outside with good stadium food and a nice atmosphere. The park could really use a modern update.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MichaelMTraveler007
30,Blue Jays vs Dodgers,"We travel once a year to watch Blue Jays series, each time to a different city/stadium. We did a tour on Dodgers stadium before the game, it’s a old style with a modern touch. Sad part is that the Dugout is covered with net preventing we get signatures from the baseball players.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rssc2018
50,Love my Dodgers,Have been to several Dodger games this year. Love sitting in the seats by the Dodger Bullpen. Great food and fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G1369MWdebbiev
30,Nothing stands out,"My husband and I are making our way to all of the ballparks, this was number 13 for us. I was underwhelmed.I did hear that they are doing renos this winter. It needs it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/4ebab
50,Fun Memory,"Fun fans, exciting game, enjoyable quizzes, great service, delicious fast food and great souvenirs! Great for tourists too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/124missyj
40,Classic stadium close to the city,"I am trying to visit all of the MLB stadiums, and this was my first visit to Dodger Stadium. I was first amaze by how large the parking lot is. Some stadiums that are in cities don't have a lot of parking and rely on public transportation, but in LA I guess more people like to drive to the game. They do encourage taking public transportation and offer a free shuttle from a nearby train station, but there are no stops at the stadium.Dodger Stadium is the 3rd oldest MLB stadium in the country, having been built in the 60s, so don't expect all the modern comforts and amenities of the stadiums built over the last 20 years. But there is a charm to it.They separate access to the lower and upper sections, which I don't think I've seen before. I sat in one of the upper decks so I didn't get to explore the lower level, but I had what I needed up top. There were food options, like the classic Dodger Dog which I did get, and team stores for those looking to buy some gear.I was definitely happy with the stadium overall, and it feels unique compared to other stadiums. Many of the newer stadiums are so alike that it is difficult to distinguish unique qualities. If you are a baseball fan and are visiting LA during baseball season, I would suggest checking out Dodger Stadium.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Smuckuss
40,Great seats & great game,"I love the feel of an old ballpark, but on my first experience to Dodgers stadium, I was left feeling some updates are much needed. Beyond that though, we had great seats and it was a fantastic game. I can report the Dodger Dogs are the best hot dogs I’ve had at a MLB stadium (and I have tried a fair #) and the Dodger Blonde Ale was a pleasant surprise!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Erin06810
20,American with Disabilities needs to know this,I’m disgusted with the lack of attention I receive today. I traveled from Long Island NY to LA to catch a game. I should report this to the ADA. I called the 323/224-1600 number at 11. I needed to be picked up in Lot B. No one picked up. I left a message with my number. I proceeded to limp to the stadium. I saw supervisor Peter. He was kind and had us use a shorter walking route. I asked Daniel and Veronica at the escalators were I should go to voice my complaint. I went to Fan Services at #31 and spoke with Ashley and Noah. They just patronized me by asking me to fill out a complaint form. I received no satisfaction. So disappointed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MonicaK614
30,Tour disappointing compared to other stadium tours,"We had hired a car specifically to reach Dodger Stadium for the stadium tour but were under whelmed. We always visit stadiums when travelling and this tour was dated and lack luster compared to many tours that we have done in European football stadiums. They have a long way to go to beat the enthusiasm and quality of these tours. After a stern list of do's and dont's from the guides we set off on the tour but it felt as if they were going through the motions. Both guides spent too much time checking their phones. In the dug out, we waited and waited to move on. There were some interesting photographs and pictures in corridors but we didn't have the opportunity to look at them. It was a good experience to see the stadium and all of our questions were answered.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/potterfan10
50,Dodgers Stadium,"Great game, great seats and really nice people. Employees were very friendly and welcoming. Baseline Club very clean, friendly atmosphere. Food was amazing, love the healthy choices.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michelesL8097LB
40,"Dodger Stadium is a great stadium, tough parking","Didger Stadium is home to a great facility close to downtown Los Angeles, parking can be a challenge.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanaLosAngeles
50,First visit to Dodger stadium,"Came in for Cards series. We got swept, but the experience at all three games was great. The historical stuff on the club level is worth going early to check out. Lots of photos and memorabilia from both Brooklyn and LA stadiums and team. Stadium club was also a cool spot pre game. Nice banter with Dodger fans was also fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robsO8154RG
50,Great Experience,"We had great seats! The set up of the stadium is great. We felt like we were entering a theme park. They make the rounds often with the snacks and drinks, but we were also very close to the snack bar. It was so much fun, we will be back!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TamiRaeM
40,"Old, Worn In Stadium","I really enjoyed the game I recently saw at Dodger Stadium. The facility may be showing its age and it's not as swanky as many of the new MLB ballparks, but it's a fun place to spend an evening.I arrived via Lyft and it was so easy. The Stadium has an organized, orderly system for rideshare users, which helps with congestion both before and after the game. There's a clearly marked area in the parking lot (but be prepared for a steep uphill climb to the main entrance gate).The staff at the stadium were fantastic! Everyone I dealt with was friendly and helpful, from the bathroom attendant to the security officers. The line to get in was long but moved fast, as did the lines for snacks once inside.The restrooms were large and clean, and I never had to wait in line to use them. The stadium seats were very comfortable and I had plenty of room, and the sight lines were great. The video screens and sound were better than most, and the home crowd was a lot of fun. The fans I encountered were all very welcoming (but again, I was cheering for the home team).The food and beverage options were surprisingly limited, and the ""world famous"" Dodger Dogs were just okay and expensive. That's basically true of just about every other sporting venue, though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/moviegal226
30,Mixed bag,"Great views and atmosphere. However, experience marred by horrendous traffic and slow concessions. Left an hour before game time and got to our seats in the fourth inning. Once there, single line concessions to get nachos ate up another two innings.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K2437LUcarolined
30,Getting Old,The old ball yard is showing some age. The Team store is in a metal shed type building. Seats are tight and not well positioned. If you attend a late afternoon game sit on the 3rd base side,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kuvasz15
50,Great venue to watch baseball,"Visiting different baseball stadiums is on my hubby's bucket list. We were in LA for an event and decided to check out a Dodgers game. The stadium has a nostalgic throwback feel while still being very up to date tech wise. Traffic is horrendous in LA so we got there really early. We found cheap easy in, easy out parking that opens up to fans after initially just for people working the stadium. It was a bit of a walk but worth it. Also LA fans tend to come late and leave early; the stadium was the fullest from the 3rd to the top of the 9th. We had a great time",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SarahPU
50,100 Times better than my last Dodger game 19 years ago,"We took the tour of Dodger Stadium, specifically, the tour which allows us on the field during each teams warm-up and batting practice. Although, you are behind a roped area, it offers opportunities to obtain autographs of players from both teams.The tour guide shared history of the Dodgers and the stadium, view nostalgia, suites, and a lot that the normal stadium tour does not include.Our tickets included first row seats in right-field behind the Right-fielder, and in the section that included all-you-can-eat food.The atmosphere in the stadium was energetic, and exciting, especially when the Dodgers started scoring. Unlike the last time I went to Dodger Stadium where nothing occurred in-between innings, there are activities, scoreboard games, and other things occurring that maintain an energetic atmosphere.For Tourists with a Big Interest in Baseball, I recommend the Premium Tour, which would be more rewarding than seeing celebrities in Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VacationerCritic
40,Fun tour,"We love to tour local stadiums when visiting, so dragged our son along for a tour. Can't beat the scenery here, and the tour was fun and informative. Went to media booths and locker rooms and you end up down on the field in the dugout. I think we drove around and went in B gate....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaryKop
20,Tired and old.,"I was expecting to have a great experience here, but was disappointed. The stadium is tired and old. Stadiums like Wrigley and Fenway have updated, yet have kept their charm intact. They seem to have plans to enhance the experience for next year's All-Star game. Sadly I do not have plans be back to see what they improve. To me the stadiums seems to be stuck in the 70's (colors and architecture).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/175shawnr
30,Paul McCartney,This venue needs upgrades in many areas. The Corredor that you walk around is very small and the bathrooms are small and extremely crowded.The parking situation is something that needs to be completely thought about it and re-done. We took an Uber car to get there which was fairly reasonable because we arrived almost 2 hours early. However there were very few employees outside of the stadium to direct people into the correct security lines. We were in one security line and got almost all the way to the front only to be told that we must walk around the stadium down 100 steps and get into a different line.The seats are old and very hard so therefore not very comfortable. The Paul McCartney show with Ringo Starr showing up at the end was an amazing show but there has to be a better venue than Dodger Stadium. We have seen him here before and he mentioned that the Beatles played Dodger Stadium back in the 60s so maybe that’s why the venue continues to get used.For those people that are Dodger Stadium regular attendees there was very little direction as to where to go and it was hard to get around both outside the stadium and inside.Once the show is over the Uber situation was an absolute disaster - it took us close to two hours to get back to our hotel which was only a 10 minute ride. If it was not in such a sketchy area it would’ve been faster for us to just walk. They have an Uber booth but they were completely overwhelmed and having 1-2 employees helping was completely useless considering the size of the crowd. Many of us walked completely out of the stadium area and down the street and we still ended up waiting over an hour and a half to get a car. It’s relatively easy to get into the stadium and to get out of the stadium if you drive however parking is an absurd $50.If you asked me if I would go back I would say “yes if I had to”meaning that if there was something I really wanted to see I would go early and be prepared for some chaos. If what I wanted to see was at another venue I would definitely go to a different venue.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AdvtrTrvlr
40,Fun but not amazing,It was a good ballpark but I admit I was a bit underwhelmed in general. Good sight lines and easy to get around.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rawband
10,Horrible venue,"Dodger Stadium once again proved to be one of the absolute worst venues for a show. Why they keep hosting events of this scale when they clearly cannot handle the traffic, parking, and efficiently getting attendees into the venue, is beyond me. Despite arriving two hours before the show, it took hours to get into a parking space. It was then another hour waiting to enter the venue. The venue staff just didn’t bother with organizing the line in any way as half of the people cut in line. Most non-Dodger fans were not familiar with the seating areas but no ushers were to be found helping people to their seats. Luckily he show started 45 minutes late, so we only missed a handful of songs. However, we were already stressed out by the time we finally got to our seats.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thelonious22
40,Beautiful ballpark for tour,"Our guide, Kat, was fantastic at sharing information and chatting with the folks in our group. The scenic views of L.A. and surrounding area are quite unique and amazing. View-wise, it seems like even the cheap seats would be good. Imagine the bleachers in the outfield would get warm facing the sun. For our tour, we started with the top section behind home plate and worked our way through the lower-level connected to a restaurant, suites, and press row. Also got to visit a dugout and several areas displaying trophies, awards, and other memorabilia from the storied franchise's past. Disappointed we didn't get to see a lockerroom, but thanks to Kat it was a very good tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jason_W_in_Indiana
40,Took in game while in town for another event,Arrived just before parking opened and after short wait got parking that sped up my exit. Nice stadium and a very peasant visit overall.

(guess this is NORMAL)...they should have it down on how to efficiently evacuate the stadium after performances...it was chaos...Uber lot was so disorganized...hard for drivers to get in and out...the staff were just telling us to walk 100 miles (not really!!) down Vin Scully Blvd, to Sunset and keep walking until people thin out and call an Uber from there!! ha! One would think with all the games, concerts, events they would have it dialed in...those that drove in and parked had the same issue...how to get out...thank goodness there were no emergencies (earthquake, fire) woulda been deadly...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kathysU5448LP

40,best way to get the La-life,"If you are still wondering how the real people from LA act: go visit the Diodger stadium during an Dodger game. At once, everybody has the same goal: supporting their local team. But: it is not only watching a game: People are walking up and down the stands as it is the most common thing to do when you watch sports. They do not attend the game most of the time, but spend more time at the hotdogstands and giftshops in the stadium during the game. Only in the 9th inning, the whole audience will be back on their places and cheer with a wave or two for their team. On fridays there is always a special treatment for the public, like fireworks of a free goodiebag.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/602ankej
50,Dodgers vs Padres Game,Had a great time at this game. Took an Uber from our hotel on Wilshire Blvd. and back. Food was excellent but LA lost the game☹️,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mjtjaxtn
40,Cool stadium with lots of history,We went to a Dodgers-Padres game on a Saturday night and it was a sold out game - the energy and crowd cheering was awesome but it made the food and bathroom lines pretty long and be prepared to wait while to exit the stadium. They do have an Uber area but it was so packed that we walked down to Vin Scully and Avenue of the Athletes (about a 10-15 min walk) to catch an Uber. Overall very cool experience in a retro style stadium with lots of history and lots fans (and palm trees don’t hurt either).,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emilytO6138AN

50,Old school since 1962,Awesome good times at the baseball games. I want to give this stadium negative stars because of the high food and drink prices but you don't have to buy anything. I pre-game before going inside because the beer and margaritas will set you back $18 or more each. I love all the hand painted murals and all the selfie spots were you can take pictures.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Creeping_Death_LA

40,Blue Heaven... Old but Wonderful,"Are you kidding? This is ""Blue Heaven"". This is one of the great old ball parks. This is this home of the Dodgers. What more do you want?The negative reviews here that judge the team are missing the point of Yelp, by the way.I know there is a separate entry for Dodger Stadium. But I read this as a review of the business, including the team and the location, the shops, restaurants, and all services related to the fans and customers... but not the running of the team! Leave that to sports bloggers and writers.So, as for the running of the business, yes I am a fan. BUT, there are issues...1. Parking staff. NOT PARKING ITSELF, which is inevitable. But the crew that leads the cars to park properly are terribly trained. They might as well use farm animals with flags. They have little collective organization and do not demonstrate any authority, so people ignore them constantly without repercussion and the results are a messy lot.2. Food. Now I AM a fan of the Dodger Dog, but I know that it is beyond basic. They have improved with a number of new items, year after year, but the quality control is poor. I have not had a HOT Dodger dog in TWO YEARS. Without exaggeration. I've asked and asked and I've been told that the dog is hot when it comes out of the warmer, but the bun is cold, then its wrapped, then its moved NOT in a warmer. So when you get it, its cold. Plan and simply. The larger dogs are better, probably because they hold warmth better. Garlic fries need to be cooked longer, they should have more NY-y style NY Pizza (the only place they have is no bueno)... but there are good things too. The nacho hat is a guilty-I'm-going-to-hell-anyway pleasure, ICEE's rock, and they have a great (albeit so so pricey) beer selection).3. Tech. COME ON. They still have a number of cathode-ray TV's mounted. The old cube ones. Heavy, silly, not even cute. Some things are nostalgic. But if I have to wait 15 mins to get a beer, I don't want to see the game on a crappy TV like that!! Ok, keep them if you want nostalgia, but as decor. Not as the main viewing screen.So, there you go. Honest critiques from a die-hard fan.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Seanemac007

50,"Cubs vs. Dodgers - Friendly fans, Read for comparison to Wrigley Field","Went to a Cubs/Dodgers game. Lots of friendly camaraderie with the fans from both teams. Dodger dog was great. Park was nice and clean. Unlike Wrigley Field, do not expect to find an usher every 10 feet to direct you to your seat. You are on your own. You enter the park on maybe the third level, and take an escalator down several flights to get to field level seats. Also unlike Wrigley, there are no score cards. Tickets were readily available day of game, anywhere you wanted for a reasonable price. I particularly liked the giant baseballs that were the parking lots section markers. We took an Uber, which was a fiasco that day, which may have been an anomaly because of some computer glitch on Uber's park. Dodger Stadium has a dedicated uber pick up section, with lots of phone chargers. It was a great night at the ball park!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SusanK751
50,Great Experience !!,I strongely suggest taking the Tour of Dodger Stadium. It is worth every penny of the cost of a ticket.

I actually liked that the food available seemed to be large hotdogs or small hotdogs (I didn't even see hamburgers, although I'm sure they must have them), and large or small ""domestic beer"". Like stepping back to Koufax and 1962 in some ways.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AFamilyAdventurer

50,Iconic and Fun!,"While I was a frequent visitor to Dodger Stadium during my childhood in the 1960s and 1970s and up until I left Los Angeles in 1988, I had not visited this iconic landmark in more than 10 years. I was pleased to see that it's still clean, still friendly and still a great place to enjoy an evening. So many landmark ballparks have been torn down, so it was nice to see the Dodger Stadium of my childhood hasn't lost the 1960s vibe I remember so well.Staff members were incredibly kind and helpful with my disabled brother, and this contributed to our overall great experience during our mutual trip down memory lane! So many stadium traditions like the Hammond Organ are still present. My only complaint is that the food is insanely expensive. The days when my late father fed an entire carload of kids for under $10 are long gone!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/324AnneG

10,The best...or the worst stadium in MLB,"Once you're in your seats, Dodger Stadium offers one of the best in-game experiences in baseball, especially for such an old stadium. The sight lines are good, the atmosphere is fun and the stadium is huge and loud...sometimes.Unfortunately, the good review stops there. From the moment you start your ingress into the stadium until the moment you end your egress it is a complete disaster. Getting in and out of the stadium can literally take hours (no exaggeration). Then they nail you with $25 parking fee.The food and bathrooms are so terrible, there aren't enough words in this review to do them justice. The food is especially awful, both in quality, pricing and the ridiculous lines you need to endure just to get robbed to eat trash. I won't even start on beer prices, but let's just say you could throw a nice party (food and drinks!) for a few dozen people with the money you'll drop on just a few beers for yourself.There is one ""Family Bathroom"" in the entire stadium and it's all the way at the very top behind home plate. If you have to change a diaper, especially if you're a dad, good luck climbing 10 flights of stairs or waiting 2 or 3 innings for the ONE elevator.Considering how much money the Dodgers make, you'd think they could do so much better than this. Unfortunately, it's more about the profits for them and less about the fan experience.My advice, stay home and watch on TV. Wait a second, most people in LA don't even get Dodger games on TV.Angels anyone???",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BeauSidwell
50,"""Let's go Dodgers""","What an absolutely amazing experience it was to attend a game at Dodgers StadiumWe haven't stopped raving about it.As first timers to L.A and with only a one night stay, we couldn't have chosen a better way to spend our evening.We booked a place at the Stadium Bar as our tickets included entry, what a great venue!Our seats were amazingThe Pre game presentations were so touching, to stand and appreciate the national Anthem which was presented with such passion, no words.We had to have a world famous Dodgers Dog, YumComing from a city who prides itself on presenting Sporting events (Melbourne), i can definitely say that i have never witnessed fan interaction like that before, Brilliant!The whole atmosphere was just fantastic. The organist, Kiss Cam, Dance Cam, Take me out to the ball game . Wow, Just WowWe love the themed appreciation days/nights too, honouring the Military etc.What a great win against the Pirates too, just topped it off for us.I think we were the loudest fans on that nightA big shout out to the way everything is so well organised at Dodgers Stadium. The food and drink venues, the extremely friendly staff around the venue.Even in the car park directing traffic, organising and helping people to use the ride share services.

30,Great ballpark but NOT pedestrian-friendly!,"Opened in 1962, Dodger Stadium is the third oldest active MLB ballpark, behind Boston’s Fenway Park and Chicago’s Wrigley Field. It’s dated, but it’s iconic and I’m so glad I visited. There were plenty of interesting photo ops and a cool museum on the upper level concourse above home plate. I had a seat in the Coca-Cola All You Can Eat Right Field Pavilion, so for just a few dollars more than a regular ticket, I could have as many Dodger Dogs (hot dogs), sodas, nachos, popcorn and peanuts I wanted. The Dodger Dogs were big and tasty (and sell for $6.75 apiece elsewhere in the stadium!) and the soda was standard, but the other items weren’t worth consuming. My seat (section 302) was a number on a wooden bench that wasn’t the most comfortable, but my row had a few no-shows so I was able to spread out a bit. I had a great view of the field, and enjoyed my visit. What I didn’t enjoy, however, was how difficult and unsafe it was to walk to the stadium. I was staying nearby and the sidewalks cut in and out, with cars zooming by at breakneck speed. The final stretch up to the hill had painted white lines instead of a sidewalk, leaving virtually nothing between walkers and cars. I didn’t feel safe, and it took a bit of enjoyment out of the experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JB81ontheroad
50,Great Stadium,"We have been to almost all the Major League Ball Parks, and our home field, Dodger Stadium still impresses us with its beauty and the wonderful views out to the mountains. Good food, okay beer choices. Terrible parking and limited public transit options.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cookpias
40,Fun night with fireworks at the end of the game,My family recently went to a Dodgers game while in LA. This is by far one of the most scenic stadiums I have ever been to. The LA skyline in the background just adds to the experience. Security is a very easy process as the stadium is divided into sections so that not everyone is entering through the same gate. The highlight was after the game when they allow the fans to go onto the field to watch the fireworks. One tip I have to give you would be eat before you go. The food is very expensive. A bottled soda will cost you 6$!!! Food plus a drink will easily cost you 15-20$ per person. You would be better served to eat before you come word to the wise.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/212stephanieo

50,Recommend to go for the experience,"Ubered both there and back from Hyatt Regency Orange County, approx $60. Did try to catch the train but that didn’t workout. Grab your dodgers gear from Orange County outlet as it’s half the price. Get a seat by the field and away from the stands, you may catch a ball. Everyone was friendly and just a good family vibe.

40,I've been going since I was a child and afterwards moved up North. A lot has changed just like everything else.,"Try and arrive about an hour and a 1/2 early. Parking is pretty confusing because it depends on where you sit.. So you won't have to dash around. You can find your seats and watch batting practice, but I would suggest leaving some of your party at the seats and let the others get food and drinks. Ok, parking 3 years ago was $25 on opening day. You can not tail gate. The 24oz $2.00 Budweiser is a whopping $16. It used to be $6 for a seat hot dog and drink. If you've never been it's beautiful. Vin Scully called it Blue Heaven on Earth. You will have a wonderful time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanK2293
40,"Beautiful Stadium, Great Food and Drinks, Great team (sometimes)",There is nothing like a trip to see the Dodgers. Parking is organized but expensive and it is usually only a short walk to the stadium. Plenty of scalpers selling tickets at the door and plenty to eat and drink inside. Best to attend night games as daytime can be very sunny and hot. If you go in the day bring a big hat.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/love2skiLosAngeles
30,Plan ahead and be ready for lines,"Beautiful venue and friendly staff. Lines were long everywhere: parking, entering and concessions.

10,Dodger stadium has many issues they need to work on,"I've been to two dozen parks, and this was easily the worst experience I've had at any of them. It took 45 minutes just to park once we arrived, and once we used the bathroom and waited in line for food, it was already the 5th inning. It was as if the staff had never dealt with large crowds before, and this was for a weekday noon game, I shudder to think what weekends might be like!After the game, we attempted to explore the park a bit, since we traveled across the country to get here and were unable to look around before the game, due to the parking fiasco. However, large portions of the park were blocked off, and their staff was completely unsympathetic to our situation. We eventually got fed up and left. In all, we sat in traffic for several hours, spent well over $100, got to see about half the game, and didn't get to fully explore the stadium. I don't know why anyone would ever do this more than once. Completely unacceptable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Amanning85
40,A Pleasant Surprise,"As a SF Giants fan I wasn't sure what to expect. Most importantly I'm a baseball fan. The overall experience was very good. Getting into the park was slow--traffic, security, long lines. It was a very large crowd. The fans were great. It was really a positive, family friendly crowd. The food was disappointing. Most ballparks that I've visited in recent years have really upgraded their food choices.The most disappointing part of the night was the Cincinnati Reds. They played as if they were 40 games behind in August.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CaliforniaCricket

The stadium itself is huge, but we had great seats and enjoyed the novelty of watching the game surrounded by palm trees in the outfield. This stadium is well staffed with security officers and customer service reps and that’s a good thing. While we felt safe in our seats, the outfield bleacher seats beyond third base are apparently known to be rowdy, and we saw a number of fights break out while we were there. Also, the stadium itself is the largest one in MLB (I’m told), and getting in and out of the place is no easy feat with all of the different levels and lots. Bring plenty of patience and extra time getting in/out, but the experience itself is well worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/843hilaryh

40,Interesting,"A very interesting and historic ballpark. If you like baseball, you should check out Dodger Stadium sometime. It's different from all other stadiums I've been to, though it is a bear to get out of it after games - just one way in and out of parking. Plan to hang out for a bit after the game.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KatKealy
40,"Great stadium, but lousy parking.","One of the best stadiums in the major leagues to see a game, it also happens to be one of the worst venues in L.A. for traffic after a game. If it's a weekend game or playoff game, exiting the stadium parking lot can easily take 45 minutes or longer. Getting in can also be a pain, with narrow two lane streets through residential neighborhoods. If you've never been before, plan on setting aside 5 hours for the game; 3 hours of baseball plus an hour in and another hour out. Dodger Dogs are an L.A. tradition along with tailgating.

50,Great Stadium,This was my first Dodgers game and it just happened to be the world series🎉 the stadium is set up excellently. Great seats and the dugout stores all along the food court were a great idea. The weather is always great in LA so that’s a perk too. Parking seemed effortless compared to Bay Area stadiums I’ve been too. Great experience,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/91brandil
50,Fun at the longest game of a World Series,"Went to game #3 and had a blast!

Decided to walk instead from Echo Park Lake to at least get to the shop and when we arrived at the gates the security guard was very rude and said no you cant go in, this isn't for tourists!!! Go home and print a ticket!! He wasn't interested in letting us just go to the store or in listening to the fact the online system wasn't working. Went back to our hotel and emailed the contact on the webpage and it took them 5 days to reply - by that time we only had one day left and they told us to phone the stadium!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/108lauram108
30,What Happened to the Fireworks?,"We love baseball and try to go to a game in every city we visit. We were excited to see one of the classic old school stadiums and purposely decided to go on Friday night because they were heavily advertising Friday Night Fireworks where fans can go on the field to enjoy the show, and that seemed like a great way to spend our last night in L.A. Getting to the stadium was pretty rough; it took us over two hours to go fifteen miles, and entry into the parking lot was extremely disorganized and chaotic with no one really seeming to be in charge. I'd recommend leaving really early if you want to get there on time. LA traffic is bad, but things could be much better organized around the stadium. Once we finally got to our seats, we enjoyed sitting out in the beautiful weather and having a Dodger dog. Then they announced fans wouldn't be allowed on the field for the fireworks which was disappointing, and they ultimately ended up just cancelling the show altogether because they said it was getting too late. We weren't in extra innings or anything, so it seemed kind of dishonest and lame to promise the fans something and then not deliver, especially for the kids in the stands. They ended up losing to a mediocre team, so we didn't really see a great game. Leaving the stadium was the same chaotic mess as the entry. Not really worth all the hassle for us. Don't pick your game based on the fireworks because they may or may not deliver on what they advertise. Hopefully you'll have a better experience than we did.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/volcanogirl
50,Must do if there is a game on!,"Myself and my partner went to a game and it was incredible! Honestly so worth it and would highly recommend doing if you are in LA. Don't pay for the really expensive seats though! We paid around 40 dollars each and we sat in section 8, Row H and it was perfect! You can even stand just behind and see really well too! Definitely get a pizza slice also!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/isabelcmoore
50,"""A Baseball Fans Dream!""","I have been coming to Dodger Stadium since 1975 when I was a child. Since then, it has always amazed me how this location defines baseball. You can not go wrong with watching a Dodger game, while eating your Dodger hot dog, as seen below. Parking is ample. Concession prices have increased, however, it should not deter your visit to the park. Security is present everywhere and this is one of the last remaining ballparks, within the United States, that has not really changed since it opened in the mid 1950's.Make sure you visit the Top of the Park store to purchase all of your Dodger gear. The other reason as to why you would want to walk up there is to see the skyline view of downtown Los Angeles. It is absolutely breathtaking if you have never seen it before. Get to the park early so that you can get to your seat on time and enjoy some Dodger peanuts.I know that I will continue to go to the Park for the remainder of my life because it always brings back some great childhood memories. If you are a true baseball fan, you must see a game at this stadium because of both the historical value and because of the Dodger crowds. This place is kid friendly and it is as though each baseball game is an actual production due to the amount of fun stuff they do between each inning.Hope this helps. See you at the game! Go Dodgers 2018!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2MARY9
50,Renovated and very clean,"Ever since the sale of the Dodgers it has been a few seasons now and the renovations are as if your visiting an entirely new complex.Pay the 35 When purchasing tickets and get the VIP tour, worth every penny.Our favorite seats are left field pavilion as the price is insanely cheap andnif you arrive at gate open you can sit anywhere along the back of the dugout. Highly encourage you to get this ticket .Remember the lionshare of fans are blue , so even if visiting I encourage you to go in blue as visiting fans are notoriously heckled. Buy all your gear at local Walmart for your best value or buy on site .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobertMelrose
40,April 2016,When I was visiting Los Angeles tried to make sure to take in a baseball game. The weather was excellent for the game. I decided to take the Dodger Stadium Express from Union Station. This makes it easier without worrying about parking. Don't actually need to have ticket to use this service. It is built right into the hill. There is some Mid-Century accents. Dodgers won so that always makes it more fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/933reeds

It’s really family friendly and good natured!We got a Lyft to the game and a taxi (from the taxi rank) back to the hotel, so much easier than driving as there were big queues and parking looked a hassle.We got given free badges from the Fan desk which said it was our first game, nice keepsake!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/655victoriak

40,Great visit helpful staff,"Went to our first Dodger game not knowing anything about the stadium the staff were very helpful, friendly and courteous. The man I spoke with explained where the main store was and told us the best way to get to our seats and really showed much aloha. Had to have a Dodger dog(actually Costco is better). Next time I'll have the chicken wings. Exciting game, Kemp hit a 2 run rbi in the bottom of the ninth for the win. Leaving the stadium took about 30 min driving. Not that bad.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marlieh2014

40,Great visit to watch the LA Dodgers,"Great visit to the Dodgers Stadium to watch a baseball match. The traffic was a nightmare to get into the parking lot and then there is a $25 fee to park onsite. Once you are through the gates of the parking lot the directions from the stewards is exceptional. To get around the stadium is pretty easy with assistance from the stewards, if they were not there we would have be lost. The food from inside is super pricey and you aren't allowed to take anything in as your bags get searched.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashleigh462018

I don't know what it is but it has something hard to describe, maybe is the size (one of the largest or THE largest ball park) and hearing all that people roar on a double play... wow!Is not the first time we go to a Pro game while visiting the states, either Football, Soccer or Baseball, we always try to schedule a game or two.The game was great, the Dodgers won, and all in the crowd were happy.It was a big surprise that at the end of the game, there was this firework show... everyone started to go from the tribune down to the field, most of them with towels to lay down and watch the show from there. We stayed at our seats and watch the big firework show.We visited with my teenagers and we all spent an unforgettable experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NOTAMWIE

All the fans were extremely nice and helpful. Lots of picture opportunities around the stadium. There’s bar in outfield and we swear people spent the entire game there. The game was followed by a great firework display!!! The only thing that wasn’t awesome was the ride share situation.

40,Great ball park,"Love how it's always so clean. There's a great view from the seats and the venue is very attractive. Glad they've added a few healthy food options, but they could use some more. Happily, though, they've started letting us bring in our own food (and non-alcoholic drinks in plastic sealed bottles). It makes an otherwise expensive outing a bit less so. The parking, though, is another story. I SOOOOOO wish there was another way to arrive and part without having to deal with that stupid parking lot. It's expensive and takes forever to exit after the games.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elainep868
50,My Favorite Venue in MLB,"I have been coming to Dodger Stadium since I was child. I have sat in every section and for every type of game. I have yet to have a bad experience.The O'Malley family built a nearly perfect place to watch a baseball game. The current ownership has returned to their tradition of lovingly maintaining it. The food options are diverse, but a grilled Dodger Dog is still unbeatable.Dodger fans are passionate. Post-season games are intense. No one like the parking lot, or the drive home. Nowhere is perfect, I suppose.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dhacker615

Seats in reserved are kind of high up but the view is still good. Food and drinks are priced on the higher side as expected but you can take in snacks and bottled water so long as it’s sealed so you don’t have to pay a ton if you have a large family.

The stadium needs a revamp. I had to walk for such a long time to sit in my seats. The seats are so tight and uncomfortable. The parking is terrible. I won’t do that again.They need a separate baseball stadium for such an event. It’s to big for baseball.I am a Padre Fan and I love Petco Stadium,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/105jeanniec
40,Great Dogs,"Had an excellent experience at Dodgers-Padres game on August 24th. The Dodger Dog did not disappoint. The only negative is getting there.

Dodgers fans are great and stay in the game.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/texasplant2016
30,Game with Friends,"We had not been to a Dodger game in years and recently were invited by friends to go with them. The stadium seating is ok, food choices were good.

You can feel the history while visiting here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nichfam
40,Nostalgic stadium,Beautiful old ballpark located in a non congested area. The drive there was easy entry and exit. Parking $25. The field itself is beautiful and the seats are comfortable with a good view from most sections. Crowd was into the game and it was an enjoyable atmosphere. The downside is the activities available on the inside and outside the stadium are very limited. The food choices are at a minimum and the inside needs a major upgrade. I believe with renovations this park can become as fan friendly as the new ones that were just built in the last 10 years. Ballpark was clean and very well secured. Ticket prices are affordable as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/203JohnT

Don't get the yellow seats, what's that about? Would never know it seated over 50k spectators. ""Dodger dog"" from the concession stand was delicious and not overpriced. Rematch of the Dodgers vs Astros so place was buzzing even though the home team lost. Agree with others, we did an UBER in and out, don't even think about driving here, but this was surely an unforgettable evening. Los Angeles folks are really polite and this was a great experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TLDWeirton
30,"Good fanbase for a good experience, but horribly disorganized stadium","Over the years, my husband and I have visited 11 ballparks throughout the country (Yankees, Mets, Indians, Pirates, Angels, Giants, Astros, Rangers, Orioles, Nationals, Red Sox) to experience the ballpark and of course watch a game. We intended to do that on our trip to see the Dodgers on bobblehead night. It was a great atmosphere, great weather, and we had fantastic seats in the Reserve Section right above home plate. I was so excited for our experience at this stadium.Parking was annoying, but easy. People directed the traffic to get you a spot, but it was quite a walk and we arrived at about 20 minutes prior to the beginning of the game. It was not a bad walk though, but probably about a half mile. It was hard to remember where we parked because it's not well labeled like other big lots. We wandered a bit when we left the game to find our car.Once we got to the gates, we got to the front of the security line and we were all ready to be inspected. The security agent asked to see our tickets and then told us we had to go all the way around to the other side of the stadium. I was REALLY SHOCKED because this was the only stadium we had been to where this was a thing. I asked why, and he said that our tickets did not give us access to any other level in the stadium other than ours. If we had known this in advance, we maybe wouldn't have been so shocked, but after having waited in a long security line only to be turned away gave us a bad taste in our mouths.We got to our security line about a half mile away uphill (and I double checked with a member of their guest services before getting into the line), and we get in. Luckily there were promotional items still left.If you are a person who likes to explore stadiums and see the different views and visit different concessions, this park isn't for you. It almost seemed elitist to prohibit people who don't pay enough money from experiencing the whole stadium.We were happy to cross this one off our list though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christinecV9554YM
40,Beautiful but a pain to get there,Saw the Dodgers play the Astros in a World Series rematch. Getting there and parking was a huge hassle which wasn't a big surprise considering it's LA.Should have done my research on which lot to park because we had a long uphill walk to our seats in the upper deck behind home plate. The view was great and the crowd was really into the game. The food was so so except for the garlic fries which were excellent.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TomMH68
40,Historic Ballpark,So much history here. Older ballpark but you can feel the history. Great view from upper deck. You can see the whole field. Really good food. Dodger burger is amazing and so are the garlic fries. Oh and the soft serve ice cream is fantastic. Really don’t think there is a bad seat in the house. Only downside is getting in the stadium driving is awful. Took almost 30 min to from entrance to parking pay window. Also parking is $25 which was more than two tickets.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelingDad84
50,Fantastic experience but don't drive there!,"I love Dodger Stadium -- it's packed with history, has a small, intimate feel (despite seats for 56,000) and hands down -- the best hot dog in any ball park in the country!It's in a beautiful location and night games offer an amazing view. And of course...the Dodgers! So all of that is wonderful.The only big con (and it is really a big one) is the parking. Take a bus, uber in or find another way to get there -- I hear the buses are okay) but do not drive. First -- the traffic getting there and getting home is insane. Beyond that, the parking is such a serious pain. It's just not worth it.Catch a ride there and then settle in for one of the best baseball experiences you could hope for!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/308drewm

50,"Beautiful Views, Great Baseball Experience","We bought our tickets on StubHub! and sat in the Reserved Section directly behind home plate on a suggestion from a friend. Needless to say, it delivered. We were rewarded throughout the game with one of the most beautiful views in all of sports. The changing colors were brilliant on the mountainous backdrop. It also helped that the Dodgers scored 21 runs (a Dodger Stadium record), so the fans were in a happy mood. They were more than welcoming to a pair of Orioles fans.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanielL2463

50,Great stadium but woeful performance,"Loved coming here to see a baseball game but the home side lost 14-0 and did not impress. The fans certainly did. Sold out 56,000. Loud noise as much as possible even when losing badly. Can easily walk around most of the stadium once inside. If shop for merchandise. Plenty of food options although not cheap on this occasion. I know they do specials on some days. Great seats and terrific view pretty much where ever you sit. We loved it. Uber back from the Uber parking lot and all that traffic. Get to a game early if a tourist and lap up the atmosphere. We arrived at 4.30pm for a 6.10pm game",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnselmColom

20,good experience - shame about the food and the con for the tourist,"We'd booked to go to a game on our visit to LA.Good atmosphere - and whatever I understood of the game was good.food was below average which you kind of expect for mass catered events but what was extremely disappointing was that they chose to give us coke in souvenir glasses (>$9 each) when we asked for coke as opposed to normal cups (~$3 each).Not a big deal but it grates when you have come across some nice people on the trip who have gone out of their way to help tourists and then you come across a giant who really let the rest down by conning the visitors. Shame on you Dodgers!!! you are letting down the bus/tram/taxi drivers/hotel workers.... who all work hard to keep the visitors happy.If you are going to a game as a tourist then it is fun if. Suggest you go early as traffic is a nightmare and the walk from carpark is long. better still, UBER it, take sandwiches from the deli and beware of the con.BJSLondon",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/880bharats
50,Loved it,We were visiting LA from Scotland and were really wanting to see a Dodgers game. We booked in advance and went for mid-higher price tickets in second tier. Seats were great- excellent view and under cover from the scorching sun. We drove so had also precooked parking. Traffic is an absolute nightmare so we ended up missing the start but this did mean there weren’t queues to get in or big queues at the food stations. Loads of choice of food-dodgers dog is a must. We thought prices were reasonable given you are in LA! Atmosphere was amazing!! So family friendly- I didn’t have much knowledge of the game or players before but I quickly got the hang of it and now we’re back home are recording the games!Highly recommend if you are visiting LA!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joanneo554

10,Horrible completely unorganised venue,"First time here to see a concert, terrible venue to see a band by the way, the sound was horrible. The worst part was getting in the place we arrived an hour and a half early, but still missed the opening songs of the band, due to the utter non excistent organisation here, no signs, no direction of where to go, we stood in line for 40 mins to be told they cant let us in here, we had to walk to another gate to get in, more time wasted, so slow, security sucked so rude to everyone, I'm glad I'm not a Dodgers fan cause Im never coming back here!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Newlifenotinoz
40,Nice,"Was my first time at Dodger Stadium and look nice for an old building. For me was really cold (61) but overall it was fun. Good fast foods, service and security was ok.

Dodgers won!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I8327RGwilliamr
50,Beautiful stadium,I’m a longtime Brooklyn resident but after seeing Dodger Stadium I see why they wanted to move. The setting with the San Gabriel mountains in the background is superb. It has aged gracefully.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rwadelman
40,Yes! Family Friendly & Fun,We have brought our kids & grandkids on a few occasions now. Always a fun and friendly time. Very safe. Exceptional staff. Pricing is equal to any stadium. We have never had a bad fan experience. The only downside is the crazy parking. You have to be very familiar with what gate to enter or you will be taking a good hike and do not plan on leaving in a hurry. we highly recommend games at this stadium.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christinecF8459HX
40,An experience,"Went to watch Dodgers v Giants. My partner loves baseball, I find it tedious, but the experience was interesting. Stadium is well appointed and the shuttle bus runs from Union station which was handy. Very poor food choice for vegetarians. Sadly the atmosphere does not live up to the atmosphere in British football stadiums, sad the announcer has to encourage fans to cheer and sing etc. But on the whole a fun experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Billy_WizzKent
30,Beautiful stadium. Nothing to do around it.,"Our hotel told us there was plenty to eat and drink around the stadium. That is incorrect. Unless you want walk around at the very bottom of the hill, which looks like a sketchy area, I wouldn’t recommend going to the game early. The stadium is beautiful but not many places to sit and eat/drink once in there. The food and drink are of course overpriced. The Dodger dog is overrated.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DubStub
40,Iconic Park,"First day in LA and went to the ""highway series"" game at Dodger stadium. I'm a Cub fan and attend Miller Park in WI so i was a little shocked at the price of tickets but when in Rome... Beautiful old park with iconic view of the mountains in the background. Hot during the day. Unbearable in the sun so sit row H or above loge 1st base side or 3rd base side. We were at a 4:15 game and it was hot. Beer, haha, over $10 bucks a 16 oz. Not drunks like up in Chicago and Milwaukee to be seen. We drank more than everyone around us combined. Guess that's their thing. Got to have a Dodger Dog. Grilled and good sized. Definitely a stop if you can. Enjoy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jacksun1002

50,Amazing night for outta towners 🤩,"Coming from Ireland we don’t have any baseball sport, so we decided to go see a dodgers game, with fireworks (something we never have either) it was truly an amazing night. I didn’t realize it went on for like 3 hours, but the atmosphere was unreal 🤩 having cold drinks and hotdogs like something out of the movies just felt surreal. I’d recommend anyone to go, and it doesn’t matter where you sit because you still get to see the stadium perfectly.Food here is good, hotdogs from $6 / $7 they also do chips, garlic chips, nachos in a helmet 🤪 large souvenir Dodgers drinking cup $10.Shuttle bus will also bring you out of the stadium at the end of the night to a main metro station where you can get other transportation home. From the stadium you can see the views of LA behind it’s spectacular.Highly recommend 💯",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ceallachain
40,"oldest park in the national league, was an experience","we did not book ahead, but it was Atlanta playing, so not sold out. we were warned at the hotel if they had been playing the angels, padres, giants or A's to just ""find a nice Mexican restaurant, coz you wont get in"". Sat third base side, second level, paid $60USD per seat. I would recommend sitting higher up, as the view is the same and the seats are cheaper. First base side evenings you will have the sun in your face, but it does seem to stay cooler on that side with the evening breezes.PS - PARK IN EMPLOYEE PARKING. There are spots there for visitors, you cant ride the shuttle but it is not a long walk (bit of a climb though) but you will be home HOURS before some people even get out of the parking lot",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/204scottm
40,A night at The Game,"If your visiting the Southern California area this is something you should do during baseball season, if you can get tickets. Overall its a great opportunity to see a baseball game at Dodger Stadium. We were there on a Friday night, got to see the Giants first the Dodgers set in the left field upper-deck great seats although, I felt a little cramped being a tall gentleman felt like the row of seats in front of me was hitting me and my knees all night long. We had a couple Dodger dogs, which really weren't all that or at least the ones that we had. There are many food options at the ballgame so there's other things to choose from. Food is rather expensive there, so be ready to break out some cash. Make sure wherever you're coming from you allow plenty of time to get there traffic is horrendous. After the game was a little hectic getting out of the parking lot since nobody directing traffic, people were constantly walking in front of your car along with other vehicles cutting in front of you made for a long night in getting out of the ballpark. So just be prepared.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jcatts
50,Viva Los Doyers!,"Got some sweet Reserve Level tickets for $15/each on the 3rd base side, real close to the foul pole, section 43. There’s not a bad seat in the house, but I especially liked the angle for seeing the right hand pitchers delivery as well as seeing the home runs in left field going right over the wall. Close to the playground area if you have kids, like the friends we went with. Purchased general parking tickets online at mlb.com for $15 before the game which beats the $25 general parking at the gate. Finally splurged on the carnitas nachos in the helmet for $20...totally worth it!! Washed it down with some Dippin’ Dots...yumm :) Stayed for the Friday night summertime fireworks show which made for a late night, but again...totally worth it!! Even though the Dodgers lost, the in-person game experience was a blast. Viva Los Doyers!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jasonfree350
50,It's Time for Dodger Baseball!,"Dodger baseball is a must for anyone living in or visiting Southern California during baseball season. It's one of those things you just have to do, whether you're a baseball fan or not. I wouldn't say that I'm a rabid Dodger fan; I don't have enough patience for the game, but I am a Dodger fan and have been since I was a kid during the Steve Garvey, Ron Cey, Mike Scioscia, Davey Lopes, Dusty Baker days. First of all, getting to a Dodger game can be a challenge, because LA traffic is already a challenge. In early June a few of us decided to not drive to the game but to take the Metro instead, and it worked out great, although we should have left a little earlier than we did. We took the Blue Line from the Long Beach Wardlow Station at 5:30 pm. Next time taking the 5:15 train would have worked a little better. We got off at Union Station and then caught the Dodger Express, a bus that was free to Dodger Stadium. There was a lane blocked off on the freeway that was for use only by the Dodger Express, so we zipped by a bunch of cars sitting in traffic. We got to our seats after the National Anthem was sung, while the players were being introduced. So, we felt a bit rushed once we got to the stadium because we should have left a little earlier, but boy, it was great not having to drive and sit in traffic, getting frustrated! The stadium itself is great! I know a bunch of families were forcibly removed from their homes in Chavez Ravine to build the stadium once the Dodgers moved from Brooklyn to Los Angeles (I'm a history teacher), I can't help but admire the beauty of the stadium, especially the field. A Jackie Robinson statue was put in place last year and my winning the Jackie Robinson Educators Breaking Boundaries Award last year coincided with the unveiling of Jackie's statue, which I thought was pretty darn cool! Hubby and I also got to hang out in a luxury box, which we will likely never see the inside of again, but if you ever get the chance to partake, do it! We got all kinds of free food, including the famous Dodger Dog, of course, plus a dessert cart was wheeled right outside. Just being able to enjoy the game in the lap of luxury was an experience I'll never forget, but I'm really one of the hoi polloi at heart and felt like the cheap seats, which aren't all that cheap, are where I really belong. The more recent game we attended with our buds was fun and since the game was on a Friday night, that meant FIREWORKS! Fans are allowed on the field after the game to enjoy the fireworks and I always like feeling the fireworks along with seeing them. The Dodger Express buses waited for us after the game and fireworks; the line was long but moved very quickly. We got home about midnight, which I think was very reasonable for an evening Dodger game. And the Dodgers won, which is always a plus!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/patty49er
40,Great to see a historic ballpark,"Able to get in a game on a layover in LA. Tickets were plentiful, but cheaper on resale market. We really enjoyed the secluded nature of the ballpark compared to the urban congestion of the surrounding LA areas. Unfortunately the entrances to the ballpark feel like a form of socioeconomics. If you had upper deck seats, not welcome to use the lower deck entrances. Once in the ballpark, views were full and unobstructed. Found the prices of food and souvenirs comparable to other stadiums. Unfortunately the food lines were absolutely ridiculous. Missed 2 innings in 1 line for food.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thomerun

The stadium was clean and easy to get around, and we had a great view from our seats in the very back of the lower section. We loved how energetic everyone was - it was nice to go to a baseball game where most of the crowd sang along to Take Me Out to the Ballgame!We also stayed for a screening of 'The Sandlot' after the game, and the movie was fairly easy to see from our seats and the audio was good, too. Definitely worth staying for a screening if there's one after your game! (You get to skip the crowds when you leave, too!)I had to knock down my rating for the prices of the food. We got a few Dodger dogs in the park, and they were way overpriced. It's to be expected at a ball park these days, but it was still frustrating.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rachel_Marie_Be

50,Great time at Dodgers game,"Parking was easy outside the stadium, we found a spot on a nearby road and walked in. The security guy at the entranced informed us to collect our 'First timers' badge which was a nice touch. Plenty of food stalls and shops for Dodgers gear. Toilets are easy to find and plenty of them. By the time we went to get our nachos in a Dodgers hat, they had run out of cheese. We got a chilli dog for sentimental sake but the bread was all soggy so a funny and messy experience. I have a whole new appreciation for the game of baseball. I much prefer it live than on TV. Highly recommend going to a game and soaking it all up. We loved it !!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ozeire

The stadium was easy to get into and the atmosphere throughout most of the game was really good. We bought tickets on short notice from a resale site they were quite high up on the third base line but for what we paid I thought they were really good value for money A few negatives, beer was $17US, this is way too expensive. Also for someone visiting for the first time trying to work out where to go after the game to try to get an Uber is difficult.

50,The best park in baseball,Understand this comes from someone who spends his summers visiting baseball parks every year. This is baseball heaven. The best affordable seats are in the top deck. Tickets there will often be cheaper on secondary website rather than direct purchase from the team. Do be aware because of the stadium design you may only enter the stadium through a gate on your level. (Field seats will enter on field level). This can confuse first timers.

50,Reds at Dodgers,Dodger Stadium opened in 1962 and is the third oldest Major League Baseball stadium currently in use. Despite its age it is in wonderful condition and is a great place to watch a game. I know the current ownership group has put a lot of money into the stadium and it shows. I went to the 5/11/18 game against the Reds and sat in the 2RS section which is behind home plate in the upper deck. It was a great vantage point and not too pricey (under $30 on SeatGeek). I prepaid for parking on the Dodgers website which is a few dollars cheaper than at the gate and can be used from your phone. It takes a lot of coordination to get so many cars in and out of the lots but the employees have it down pretty well.The stadium is very easy to get around in since it is built into Chavez Ravine. The area behind home plate outside the upper tier section affords a great view of downtown Los Angeles. I enjoyed walking around the stadium and taking in different vantage points. Although the Dodgers lost I had a great time at this classic MLB stadium and look forward to visiting again at some point in the future.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GoVols79
40,Dodger Stadium,Overall good visit but parking is s problem. Trying to get back to correct lot was ridiculous.

50,Dreamlike moment,"I had wanted to visit there for 17 years and it came true! But I want you to be careful about the open gates on days without Dodgers games: only Sunset Gate. I ran around the ballpark, which exhausted me. The ballpark is the most beautiful in the world!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/josephtE334VF
30,Dodger Dump,"First off you are forced to pay $25 just to park and I wonder where all that parking money is going because it doesn't offset the high food and drink prices or any renovations from this relic from the past.Old school stadiums mean you can't walk around the entire place and pretty much need to be in your seat to watch the action. So after your parking fee, you get to pay $15 for a beer and $15 more for carne asada nacho fries (not bad).It's a nice stadium if we were in the 1970's and they do have a decent amount of food and photo opportunities, but nothing else stood out. Most of the bars inside require you to watch the game from a TV set, so that stinks. Anyway, if your only going once and visiting, splurge and get lower seats (row A). If you sit any higher and are rooting for the other team (DBacks in this case) you probably have a decent chance of a brawl with drunk Dodger fans. Tonight, Arizona had the last laugh, winning in 12 innings!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bradh556

It was obvious that millions have been spent to bring it up to the standards of newer stadiums. A real bonus was free shuttles from Union Station, a 20 minute ride. It appeared there was plenty of parking, although it wasn't inexpensive. Some lots were $50 to park. We enjoyed our visit and will recommend a ball game in this park is well worth the price of the seat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/billv885
40,Great atmosphere,Despite the result of the game our family had a great time. Food is pricey (paid $45 for 2 beers and 3 waters) so suggest to take your own if you have a big family. Great atmosphere and staff were great who were guiding people in and out of the field.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheKDodd
50,First Visit To Dodger Stadium,My wife and I had a nice time visiting Dodger Stadium for the first time ever with a sea of blue all around. It is a beautiful park. If we get a chance we will be back again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheFigs83
40,Still a Unique Place,"A visit here was on my bucket list. Over the years mostly in World Series games I've been to the stadium on tv, but not in person. It turned out better than expected, since the Dodgers won. Expect to pay close to double for what you buy to eat and drink elsewhere. I would recommend the second tier where we sat, on the first base side. You are close to the action and have a chance to come up with a foul ball.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/THFinPR
40,Dodger Dogs,The Dodger Dogs are getting worse everytime we go see a game. I will differently get something else to eat the next time we go see a game. Last year we were in Colorado and decided to see a Rockies game. What a beautiful stadium it puts Dodger Stadium to shame. But I bleed blue so when I have a chance I will always try and go to a game & support my home team.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dsh91367
50,Let's go DOYERS!!,"The Dodgers aren't playing all too well right now, but they'll make a comeback! Great place to grab a Dodger dog, garlic fries and a bag of peanuts!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pnitake

50,Such a great afternoon!,"My husband is a huge baseball fan so it was a given that we would be spending some time at this iconic stadium during our recent visit to LA. We did the pre-game tour which I highly recommend. You get into the stadium before anyone else and have the place to yourself while the guide takes you into the press room, the museum hall and even right down on the field for batting practice. Well worth it to book this tour ahead of time. We then stayed for the game and ended up sitting right behind a celebrity. It is such a fun day even if you aren't a big fan of baseball.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CAM1202
50,Easy access from Santa Monica,I was on a business trip to Santa Monica and was interested in attending a Dodger game - vs the Marlins on Monday 23 April.I thought it would be too difficult to get to the stadium but this was not the case.I took the metro from downtown Santa Monica to the 7th Street Metro Center to Union Station. There then was free bus service to the Stadium. The trip took 2 hours and cost $1.50 - peek hour fee.The return trip took about 1.5 hours for approximately $1I enjoyed the game even though the Dodgers wonThus if in LA and interested in attending a Dodger game do so as easy access is available through metro,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bubdebronx
50,Our First Professional Dodger’s Baseball Game,"We were very EXCITED to see our very First Professional Baseball Game, but we had some reservation because we were bringing our elderly handicapped Dad. So along with long walking distances, stairs, and crowds to get thru, we thought we had a bit of an uphill battle ahead of us. No so,...they gave us close parking, picked us up in a golf cart, drove us to the stadium, met us with a wheel chair, upgraded our ticket (to avoid stairs) AMAZING Customer Service, they could not do enough for us. These people really love their jobs!!! And it showed. The game was great!!! We saw Brad Pitt (Bonus),...And at the end of the game the golf cart was there to pick us up and bring us back to our car. What a GREAT bucket list Day!!!!Thanks too the Staff at Dodgers Stadium!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/herbj2015
30,Beautiful Park but No Blue Jerseys,"My son was so excited to finally visit Dodger Stadium and had saved up for a Jersey. All they had in the Stadium were Grey Jerseys. He had his heart set on the traditional Blue jersey but was told by staff there that they did not have them at the Stadium and did not sell them anywhere nearby. He ended up with a Grey jersey but then saw several official Blue jerseys in stores in the LA area after his visit to Dodger Stadium - needless to say, he was very disappointed! Other than that though, an iconic stadium to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Roam1010
50,Go Dodgers!,My favorite team since way back when. Stadium is nostalgic and filled with excitement and history! Don’t forget to get your Dodger Dog and a bag of peanuts!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Piiiiiiiiiiza
50,"First time visit, we had a ball :D",You must see a baseball game if you are heading to LA. We did and we are so glad we bought tickets. It was so much fun. It was our first baseball game and it was easy to follow. Go the Dodgers!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/630vanessaf
50,Best experience ever!!,"It was always on my bucket list to see a live Major League game so on our trip to LA a match at Dodger Stadium was compulsory.We booked tickets on Jackie Robinson Day and were stoked when we received our free number 42 jersey on entry.Our seats were about $35 each and we’re we’re on the second tier from the top, but honestly I don’t think it matters where you sit in this place because we could see everything! We were a bit out of range to catch a foul ball but that didn’t take away from the experience.Now the food.... you must try the nachos in the helmet. They were amazing, big, tasty and SERVED IN A HELMET, what more can you ask for. Dodger dogs were good but didn’t blow me away and my son nearly fainted when he saw the size of the pizza slices. Food was fantastic and exactly what I was hoping for.Now for the negatives. The prices. I know I’m at Dodger stadium but, really, $15 for a can of beer? I could buy a 6 pack for less at the shops! And the food (although great) was expensive. Thee were 4 of us who went and despite getting cheap tickets I reckon I dropped $200 on food and drink while I was there.The last thing to mention is the location. Watching baseball in front of a mountain backdrop is just glorious and must be experienced first hand, we saw a day game but I’d love to see it at night next time.Americans know how to do sports there is no doubt about that. We think we Australians put on good sports events but we don’t have a clue, the yanks are the masters.A must do!!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sifterboy
30,Dodgers Marlins,Stadium was pretty cool. Older place but it appears well maintained. Views from almost everywhere i walked appeared good.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PTycz
30,Crazy expensive ~ ok stadium,"Went to the Dodgers game on Friday night. Tickets were $140.00 each, parking is anywhere between $25.00 and $50.00 so we took an Uber from H.B., that cost $50.00. The beer is $15.50 each...the fries with some cheese and a few sprinkles of beef are $15.00...the Dodger dog, which is only sold at 2 stands we found out after standing in line for 2 innings is $8.00...the Uber ride home was $100.00....Sitting in the stands was like Grand Central Station. Everyone showed up around the 7th inning to sit in their seats, but in the meantime, it was up and down and people walking in front of you constantly while trying to watch the game. Not to mention people would stand up and not move... We stood in line to pay for a bottle of beer that we served to ourselves out of the cooler and when we got to the girl that was ringing us out, she causally said, this line is closed. It took forever to get anything...as I noticed the staff took their sweet time. The guy in the parking stand made us sit there and wait 5 mins. while he clumsily changed out his printer tape on his cash machine only to finally wave us thru because the Uber wasn't parking! Good lord!!!!I've been to many stadiums and games, and this one ranks in the bottom of my list. Too expensive, too many rude and inconsiderate people. I would not recommend spending your hard earned money to see these over paid players play a game in an over priced stadium/tickets/food/parked.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jenniferwC7421HD
50,Great atmosphere,Houston juice box is my over commercialized home field. I like going to baseball games when out of town. You are at Dodger Stadium for the fun and to enjoy baseball. The staff and fans are really nice. I got a bunch of hi fives because of my funny T-shirt. Don’t pass up a hotdog and a beer. The area is pretty cool. Ubering in and out was easy. When you get seats check for sun exposure or make sure you have your sunblock. The couple we were with got a little too much sun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Phrogtours
50,Easter Dodgers and Giants.,"A lot of history here, spent my youth going to games. Great Stadium. I recommend taking Uber to the game, they have a special lot that works well with Uber riders. Must have is the Dodger Dog. It is great that they have Vin Scully's voice and calls playing on the scoreboard. Perhaps they could reduce the music.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leoa985
50,Opening Day 2018!,"i am now 64 and have been coming to Dodger stadium since I was 8 with my grandfather. While the advertising has changed and the beer and seat prices are no longer $1.50, the atmosphere and grandeur of this vintage stadium has not changed on iota. I love coming to ball games here, just don't expect to get out the parking lot any time soon after the game!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashebroe
50,Baseball game,"We were in LA on holiday, and took the opportunity to attend a game at the Dodgers. What a fantastic decision, great stadium, great setting, worth the trip to attend here. Huge on site car parking available. The views from behind home plate were fantastic as the sun set. Would visit again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DarrenA296
50,Take the Stadium Tour,"Went to two games here in July with family. We were part of a tour group so did not have to deal with parking. This group visit included the stadium tour. The stadium tour allows you to see the teams gold gloves, silver slugger bats, and MVP awards. Have been to numerous stadiums and this was one of my favorites. Dodger stadium has a very 1960's feel to it, I hope they never modernize the stadium as the 1960's feel is really the essence of the experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/krogersku

50,Ravine Wonderfully Used for Baseball!,Our friends took us to see Dodger Stadium when the 2017 World Series was in Houston.We were able to drive up the big parking lot to the top of the ravine and walk into the gift shop and foyer above home plate. I am not sure which was prettier: the freshly cut outfield below and to the east or the scenic view of downtown LA to the west.Nearby and also worth visiting is the LA Police Academy which our host had once attended.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mr__LS99

50,Best $20 ever spent,"Just got there in time for the 1 pm tour. ( I arrived 1.02 ) caught up with the lovely tour guide who took me on an amazing journey. This tour took me down to the dugout. I sat where all the players do on game day. We went up to the media centre where the reporters work their magic. Hall of fames, golden gloves, sluggers, the list just goes on. My tour was 90 minutes long . I always thought the music was recorded and they just pushed a button- no no no it’s real. There is an organist. Who knew. The souvenir shop is reasonably priced. I had a wonderful taxi driver waiting to pick me up so was quick shop ( just as well because there’s no room in my backpack)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/caroleh706
50,Take Me Out To The Ballgame,"Once known as Chavez Ravine, Dodger Stadium is just North of Downtown Los Angeles.in the Elysian Park neighborhood.The ballpark is beautifully groomed and naturally during baseball season is very vibrant.

40,"Great ballpark, terrible dog","Very fun stadium, there is only one way in and out but doesn't seem like it. My wife had a hurt leg so I paid about $20 for closer parking, that isn't bad at all. You enter the stadium from above and the field is below. Very fun atmosphere, great views, and you never know if you will see a celebrity.I always get the stadiums hot dog as that is key to a great afternoon at a ball park. The dodger dog wasn't great. It was just a foot long hot dog that you can get at any grocery store at $1 for a pack.Stadium and atmosphere awesome, concessions terrible.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kierstena2014
40,Big Baseball Fan,"I'm a big fan of the Yankees, so Dodger Stadium is where our nemisis lives. It's a really nice stadium, very big. And it sits ontop of a hill, so you can get a beautiful picture of the city at sunset if you wait.You can take the tour, i didn't but i hear it's worth it.It's the 3rd oldest stadium in the MLB, behind Fenway and Wrigley. That's hard to believe. I hope the Dodgers keep the stadium and upgrade it more, through the years.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Slab
50,Play ball !!!!,"Caught a dodger game . Beautiful weather for a game . Got seats in the lower level very comfy not a tight as other stadium I’ve been too didn’t feel like it was been smashed to the person next to me . Gift shop had everything . Took I nice walk to get to stadium from the rideshare drop off . They also have a ride share uber pick up spot which is great . Typical prices for ball park food .

50,Birthday weekend at Dodger Stadium,My two sons and I went to dodger Stadium for my birthday. The stadium is amazing. It has a variety of historical areas to see.

40,First time at the baseball.,Get there early so you can experience everything from the national anthem to the crowds coming in.

Dodgers lost but still a memorable night. Australia isn't big in baseball but what you guys have is unreal.

Highly recommended to anyone that wants to experience a true slice of the USA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danib83
10,A Biased Review but wouldn't you be biased after this experience.,"My middle boy loves baseball so Dodger stadium sounds like a great experience but this is a big stadium. We went with the boy scouts and I kid you not, nosebleed doesn't even begin to do these seats justice. Why you would not give youngsters coming as a group good seats to foster interest is beyond me.The players looked like specks on the grass. The audio is insipid so the highlight of the game for the scouts was an overpriced Dodge Hotdog and chatting with their friends.If you have good seats then you will have a completely different experience. It's California and the games can go long so wear your sunscreen If you were going to go this would have been the season to do it. Very exciting times for the Dodgers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelsG3005BB
50,Such a Beautiful Ball Park,"Luckily, I went to several game in this beautiful, clean ball park this summer and fall. The Dodgers had a great season, going all the way to the World Series.

50,One of Baseball's Most Beautiful Stadiums.,"Dodger Stadium is one of the last older stadiums left in baseball. I have heard many baseball players say it's their favorite stadium in which to play baseball. It's still beautiful, with its iconic view of palm trees past left field. There are many entrances so if you know the ropes, you can avoid traffic snarls on the way in, but everybody suffers on the way out. It takes forever, so go to the restroom before you get back in your car. There are many different levels of experiences, both seating and food wise at different ticket prices, but from the most to the least expensive, it's all pretty good and delicious. I just think they should be ashamed of their parking fees.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eboosler
50,Stadium tour,Unfortunately we weren't at the right time to see a game but the tour was great! We booked our tickets on line.

40,"Fun and lively atmosphere, even if you're not a baseball fan!",Watched a Dodgers game on our honeymoon from the UK. I've never watched baseball in my life but had the best time.

40,had a good time at dodger stadium,"I went to watch the world baseball classic. If you are going go with time in advanced as it its not easy to get there and there will be a lot of traffic.

50,Classic ball field with traditional character.,Classic ball field with traditional character. It just feels like a baseball field. So many of the new stadiums are caught up in tourist hype. Not Dodger Stadium. Sure they have cleaned it up and put lipstick on it. But it’s an outdoor ball field with great views of the field. What used to be the cheap seats in center field are still fun. They used to give the seats away with the purchase of potato chips. No more. Just as everywhere these days nothing is cheap at Dodger Stadium.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cavydad
50,Great atmosphere!,"We came as a corporate group (they even welcomed our group on the electronic scoreboard) and had a blast. I’m from Australia and not a baseball fan per se, but really got immersed in the game and atmosphere and had a rollicking time. I even bought merchandise - an LA Dodgers t-shirt and couldn’t resist a famous Dodgers dog. Celebrities go - we saw Andy Garcia in the audience.A Dodgers game is a great way to spend 3 hours of your time in LA (the games are long!) and an experience you won’t forget. Traffic gets busy so give yourself plenty of time. Uber drivers have a special drop off/pick up points and is a good travel option (we got there with no major delays).Miami Marlins v Los Angeles Dodgers - May 18 2017",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WorldTravla7

Food was average, however, the Park has an overwhelming garlic smell wafting throughout. There was only one stand that had white wine for sale on the upper level. That was inconvenient to have to walk up two levels of stairs to get a drink. Parking was confusing and not well marked.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/674dianeq
20,"Picturesque, but a nightmare experience.","The stadium, itself, is an attractive place to watch a major league baseball game. Getting in, around, and out of it are a nightmare. It is located near downtown, so you have commute traffic to deal with for weeknight games. The parking lots are large but difficult to get to. The stadium concourses are woefully inadequate for the number of people that attend Dodger games. After the game, trying to escape is horrible. Escalators and elevators are few in number. Even stairwells are not numerous. Getting out of the parking lots takes an hour or more.I can see why attendees leave after the 7th inning.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ransom007

40,Great Venue only one rude employee,"Stunning historic stadium, get there early as the parking is pretty tough. We were there for a Cubs Vs Dodgers playoff game and hadn't prepared for the 25-30 minute grueling last mile that took close to an hour. With 10,000+ cars all entering through a few gates and stopping to pay the $35. its understandable. I would advise going early parking a distance from the stadium or taking public transportation if there is any! We were wearing our Cubs Jerseys and didn't get a hard time from any of the other fans, just a little friendly ribbing. The food was good, except the garlic frys which had raw ground garlic, it was almost inedible, and I guess we expected the garlic to be cooked. The only person we ran into that was pretty rude was a parking lot traffic person who tried to point us in the opposite direction of our car when asked directions. We could tell he was lying and being sketchy, obviously our Cubs shirts didn't help! Overall I would gladly go see another game there and loved the view from our seats.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KWChicagoAgent
50,Wow! Wow! Wow!,This was our first time at a ball game and what a place to start!! Being from AUstralia we don't have the baseball experience at home so this was a must do for us.We were staying in hollywood so caught the metro to union and then the dodger express to the stadium for the game.We entered the stadium at the top of the park. To say the view from the top of the stadium is great would be an understatement - it was amazing!We had purchased our tickets through stubhub and got front or a section so that no one was sitting in front of us. Our seats were amazing.Overall a great experience for our family (kids 11 and 14) - right down to the 7th innings strength and a sing a long - take me out to the ball game....loved it,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TraceyB788
40,First baseball experience,"We have fallen in love with baseball, it was such a great evening and the fans are so passionate, it's great to watch.We had walked to the stadium from Wilshire which took about 50 minutes and as it was a very warm evening (and the stadium is atop a giant hill) we were tired by the time we arrived. Watching the sunset on the hill is incredible - it has the best views of Downtown.We found our seats only to find someone else in them as people must sit wherever they like for the quieter games. They left a huge pile of nutshells and empty cups for us, it was very slobby.The game went on for over 3 hours and started to get a little repetitive but we enjoyed it nonetheless. Do not order the nachos - they handed my partner a packet of chips and some jalapenos for almost $10. That does not mean nachos.When leaving the stadium we took the free express bus back to Union Station and walked to our apartment from there. While I wouldn't recommend doing this on your own, it was much better than sitting in traffic like those that had driven.

The pizza was delicious but don't waste your time on the garlic fries! ;) Getting out of the parking lot after the game was a little bit of a nightmare so paying the extra for preferred parking might be a good idea!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kjstreet
30,"Love the Stadium, hate the before and after","I've been going to Dodger Stadium since the late 1960s and have seen a lot of changes. The stadium has been renovated, concessions changed and the overall fan experience updated as the times have changed. What hasn't gotten better though is the parking and traffic. Do not drive if you can either take public transportation or get dropped off and walk in and out. My most recent experience was the final straw. First playoff game, which took over 40 minutes just to get to the gates with my parking pass, literally moving maybe 500 yards. Then our parking pass, which wasn't cheap was useless because our lot was full.. How can you sell passes and not have enough spaces to accommodate them, especially at the prices they charge? Missed the first inning and a half when we were literally 1/2 mile away 30 minutes before the game even started. Why do Dodger fans leave early all the time? To avoid a slog of an exodus that makes going to a midweek game for anyone who works or has school a painful experience by getting home way too late. Would go to so many more games if it was a better situation but ....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kcslatts
50,Great ballpark! Have to see a game here!,"If you love baseball and want to get to all of the stadiums, this one is a must visit! Very clean ballpark, lots of great food, friendly staff to help you get where you need to go, fantastic parking, and awesome views of LA depending on where you are sitting. Great seats pretty much in every part of the ballpark, not a bad seat in the place! Overall, very enjoyable to watch a game here! Must attend if you have the chance!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BradyK177
40,Nice Stadium,"As an Englishman & a fan of the game, I experienced my first 'Ball Game' at Dodger Stadium, the night they won their division against San Fran. The stadium was a nice stadium, the price on things were expensive & they need to change their stance on ripping their fans off, but was a good place to visit. The locals were friendly & nice. 8/10",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PoorLittleGarf
30,"Good enterntainment, sub par concessions experience.","Seats were great, and had a great view of the sun setting over the top deck.Good evenings entertainment for a couple of tourists, even if we couldn't last the whole game!Dodger Stadium DOES NOT ACCEPT a UK driving license as a valid form of ID for alcoholic beverage purchase, so a 30+ couple had to share a Coke. We tend to leave our passports in the hotel safe when travelling, and this is the only time I've been refused service in the US. On the plus side we saved a fortune on beer! $$$Food was average at best. Dodger dog looked bigger in the pictures! Would have gone down better with a nice cold one!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/474benjamino

30,Dodger Fan Forever,"As a life-long Dodger fan, I took my wife and I to a Dodger game at Chavez Ravine last summer. The stadium is an outstanding venue to watch a baseball game, the concessions offer a great variety of food and beverages as well, but it was mind-numbing trying to exit the parking lot after the game was over. It took us two hours to get out of the parking lot and onto a surface street that would lead us to the freeway after the game. What an ordeal! We drove to the game from Temecula, and it was midnight when we got home that night. As a true-blue, died-in-the-wool Dodger fan, I will always love my Dodgers, but it will be a long time before I attend another home game at Chavez Ravine.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M7630QKdennisc

50,Professional guides - good value,"Uber from Hollywood area to Stadium costs approx $12 and takes 25 mins. Tour guide was James who had an encyclopaedic knowledge of all things Dodger related. The tour lasted 2 hours and included sponsor boxes, press box, trophy room, pitch side and dug outs. Entrance via ""top of the park"" which incidentally gives great views over downtown LA and the Hollywood sign. On site photographer charges $20 for 2no 6*4 prints which is a bit salty. You are free to take your own and you can use the same locations. You are allowed 10% off goods at the club shop after the tour. Overall great value for the $20 fee.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevehD644YA

40,Dodger Stadium - A baseball cathedral,"I've been going to Dodger stadium since it opened in 1962. It is one of last of the mega stadiums built in the 60's and 70's. Thus, seating is 50k+ and the parking lot is huge and located as a stand-alone venue.It is known as the cathedral of baseball stadiums based on the condition of the park, the layout and totally symmetry the way the diamond is built.Regardless of where you sit you can enjoy the game.The biggest criticism by those who are not die-hard Dodger fans or baseball fans is the stadium is old and outdated. Therein, lays the magic of ""The Ravine.""What is does lack are the ammenities many of the newer stadiums have. The concessions are barely acceptable and I attribute that due to the design of the venue. Staff is always courteous but they are slow or it takes a long time to get your refreshments.All that being said, it is a once in a lifetime treat to see a game at Dodger Stadium. You are allowed to bring your food, water and even soft drink as long as it is in a plastic unopened bottle.For parking, it is best to order online via the Dodgers website as you receive a nice savings. As for public transportation, unlike many of the new stadiums which are built alongside public rail, the best you will find is a Dodger Shuttle. It runs all of the time and you simply get it from Union Station (about 2 miles east). There is no charge to ride the shuttle. If you drive your car to Union Station and wish to take the shuttle to avoid the lines or charge, you can park at Union Station for $8 and simply walk to the Shuttle zone to be wisked to the stadium.For those who truly enjoy exercising there is street parking but its a nice hike to the stadium which is not unbearable, as long as you have planned properly.The key to going to Dodger stadium is to properly prepare for your visit. It is what it is, but for those who appreciate tradition you will love the vibe.One more tip. If you are a first timer to the stadium BE SURE TO STOP by one of the guest service booths (at all levels) and pick up your personalized certificate signed by Magic Johnson.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fredyt3
30,Disappointed,"Our 15th MLB park to visit. Having never been here, I checked out parking lots in relation to where I wanted to sit. Got my tickets and parking pass and away we went. No problem getting to the parking lot or parking in the preferred lot on the first base side. We were a little early to the park and were told that since we had field level tickets that we had to go to the right field gate. HALFWAY around the stinking park! When we finally got to our seats, we asked a concierge in the area about getting out when the game was over. He was very nice and told how to get to our parking lot not far from our seating section. Up escalators and elevators 5 floors instead of walking back up that insane hill where the park is built. Really need to train the employees better. Also had no Dodger Hall of Fame or Exhibit area. Only a small area in the hallway with no air conditioning and it was stifling hot there. Not one of my favorite parks for sure. Better than Rodgers Centre in Toronto, but far behind Fenway or Houston or St Louis. At least there were cup holders on the seats in front of us. Thank goodness for the savior concierge!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/g3times

40,Dodger vs Rockies,"First time at the Dodger Stadium in LA. Went to see the Dogers vs Rockies game on a Friday night. The atmosphere was fantastic, full stadium with home team shown solid support. There are a lot of food and drinks stands as well as souvenirs to check out at the stadium. Recommend to arrive a bit early and leave early otherwise end up wasting a lot of time parking. Also missed out on Bobblehead giveaways as were a bit late to the game",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andrey157
40,Great older baseball park,"We attended a game at Dodger Stadium on September 9th and had a great time inspire of the Dodgers coming up one run short of a win. We had seats in the Loge level, right field area. The stadium is well maintained and has good viewing angles. Speaking of views. The views of the mountains beyond the outfield is very good, but the views from the upper deck of Los Angeles is well worth the climb or wait for an elevator. The nachos and Dodgers dogs were as good as any other ballpark fare. If you have time while in LA, take in a game at this great stadium.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SteveA271

Billy Ray sang the national anthem ... while we stood in line outside waiting to get in , the wait time is quite long but once ur in it's a fantastic atmosphere, there's many bars and food places , we had good seats we could see everything.

30,A confusing stadium,"This was my first Dodgers game. The drive to the stadium was very slow, but that's LA. Parking attendants directed everyone to the parking so that went smoothly. Once inside my section was 140 so I went to the sign that said 139-141. I soon realized that there was no 140 there, it was 139 AND 141. I had to walk to the other side of the stadium for 138-140...There were lots of food and beer stands. Also lots of merch shops. Beer was $15 a glass, I couldn't believe how much it was!Visibility from the Loge section was great. The Dodgers lost but it was still an enjoyable time.Departing was confusing. There were no signs that clearly marked the exit to the parking sections. I went up and down stairs before finally making my way out to the wrong parking section. I was in section 1 so you would think it would be easy to find. Nope. I passed section M, N, O and then it changed to A, B, C! Finally I found 1. There is no logical sequence to the parking sections. For crying out loud stick with only letters or only numbers and order them sequentially. I know this is an old stadium so it wasn't built intuitively or efficiently. Hopefully they get a new stadium soon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Matticus01
50,Must See Stadium,I travel around the county quite a bit. I've been to about 20 baseball stadiums. I've been to this one (3) times. I would go again in a heart beat. This is a must see. It's historic and beautiful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/198tomf198

Home to the Dodgers and their amazing list of great players, this is truly one of the best places to see a baseball game. Food is good too.

40,Great Spectacle .... Shame about the result,Take in a baseball game at a great stadium and you'll get a crash course in American Culture.As the third oldest MLB Stadium it's well worth the visit. To a Brit the Dodger's Stadium being built in 1962 doesn't feel old. Especially when I am older than the Stadium 😊The feel of the place still hasn't let go of the link back to Brooklyn 😊 Though the fans are not slow to let the players know their short comings 😊My top tip ... Take the free Stadium Bus from Union Station,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cherage

The stadium is modern, capacity of 56.000 (biggest in the U.S.), has a lot of food and drink stands and shops.We also had the luck of watching the Dodgers turn a 2-4 score in the bottom of the ninth, into a 5-4 victory (half the stadium was empty by the time it happened, so let that be a reminder that the game is not over until the last out).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Milo1967

30,Friday fireworks,"Get tickets for a Friday game when they have fireworks. Their fireworks display is better than most July 4th celebrations. They also allow you to go on the field to view the fireworks.If you plan to Uber, be prepared to wait upwards of an hour for your Uber pickup. The Uber pickup is in lot 11. You are corralled in a holding area with hundreds of other people waiting for their Uber or Lift. Cell service is spotty, so some dirvers have trouble getting in contact with the passengers. Positive side is they have a massive cell phone charging station in the uber waiting area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tripping20166
50,First Trip to Dodger Stadium-Epic!,"Loved Dodger Stadium. First trip and it was terrific. Built in 1962, but has wide concourses and escalators-ahead of it's time. Had a Dodger Dog-it was OK, not the greatest dog, but eating it in Dodger Stadium was perfect. Beer is pricey as you would expect as is parking, $50 for preferred-yikes!

You do not feel packed in and it doesn't look like there is a bad seat in the place. Also washrooms everywhere!! Food and beer is way over priced, $6.50 USD for a dodgers dog and $12 USD for a bottle can of Budweiser 😡😡😡. Overall a great experience 4/5 🌶",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kinggillen
40,Surprisingly comfortable,"As Rockies fans, we were a little worried about visiting Dodger Stadium. It was hard to get to, impossible to walk to, but once we were there it had a pleasant touch of Hollywood with palm trees and a mist closing in making you feel like you were on a set. It was a little raucous, I had nacho cheese thrown on me from the seats at the level above, but a nice stranger in front of me offered to help me clean it off. Overall it was like LA--diverse, passionate, star-studded and yet totally accessible and welcoming in a very urban sort of way. While it's hard to get to, the Uber zone home worked pretty well once we figured it out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Happiness53862895686

50,Great American Pass Time,We were able to but attend a home game where the home team lost. It was pleasant evening non the less. The Dodger Dogs were tasty and evening pleasant.

50,Mid century feel,This was one of our stops on our 5 stadium trip down California coast. It is the oldest park west of the Mississippi and has a mid-century space age type decor. As a Seattle native it is similar to the Worlds Fair decor at Seattle center.There is a proud tradition associated to this park and rabid fans bleed Dodger blue. They have a couple of unique food options (Hawaiian hot dog) was my choice.The park sits in a bowl strategically facing a canyon. The seats are comfortable and park laid out well. It was built before the shift to all seats facing home plate but good views from all areas.It is one of my favorite parks as it is unique. It is a must visit for any baseball fan.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/27claudettec
50,Another great experience.,We’ve been to Dodger stadium before and this year was no exception. I make it a point to see at least one game while I’m home in the summer. What set this apart from other trips is the Dodgers are simply awesome and almost unbeatable at home. One comes to this beautiful park expecting a wonderful and magical visit but this year we come expecting to win. The park is just wonderful and still as beautiful as ever and they sure did win.

30,"Great view, but old ballpark","When you are in the seats at Dodger Stadium, the view is tremendous. The view overlooking the mountains and Hollywood Hills in the early evening is outstanding. The food is overpriced as it is in all ballparks, but nothing outrageous. The one thing to note is getting from the Top Deck of the park to the lower levels can require some effort. First the exterior parking lots and entrances are scaled all over. There is an elevator to move about, but the escalators leave you 2 levels short of the top deck and lower bowl area meaning there's a lot of stairs to climb.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G_R123456789

40,Old ballpark!,"We had great seats looking down the third baseline behind home plate. We purchased our tickets at the ticket window as the game against the Padres was not a sell out even though they were giving away back packs to children coming to the game. We took the Metro to Union Station in hopes of taking the Dodger Express busses to the park but we were 50 minutes early and the busses hadn't started running yet so we took Uber to the park. There are loads of food choices at the park including Tommy LaSorda's Trattoria behind center field as well as a BBQ restaurant just beyond that. You can find hamburgers, Dodger dogs, garlic fries, ice cream, peanuts and much more. Prices are high so be prepared. Parking fees range from 10$ to 50$. There is a taxi stand near Gate G and Uber/Lyft is located in Lot 11 and was very confusing/crowded after the game, took 20 minutes for a car.

40,Full Count!,"First game back at the stadium in 30 years. We drove down from NorCal and saw the Giants almost win on a Friday fireworks night. Same Dodgers...always seem to win the game. A very pleasant experience. We were in the upper deck on the left. Very good sight lines for the entire game. They let fans onto the field after the game to see the fireworks in left field. We just sat in our seats. The crowd was family friendly. Purchase tickets online as well as your parking pass. We were first confused as to where we were sitting, but uniformed attendants helped us nicely. Parking was organized and exiting after the game was flawless. We stayed in Glendale and were back at our hotel in 30 minutes. Some negatives: We think the food fare needs to improve...more selections. I had a Dodger Dog and wolfed it down in seconds. It seemed smaller than years ago. And Dodger souvenirs and clothing will break your bank. For example, a Jackie Robinson T-Shirt is $72! I saw hardly any worthwhile hat pins and so didn't buy anything. Bummer. All-in-all, it was a good time. Go!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cameronb508

But the stadium reminds me of that concrete uninspired stadium called Qualcomm down in San Diego. Better bet for a true ballpark experience is with the Angels in Anaheim or the Padres in SD, now those are nice ballparks.Nice thing here though is the fans, they are loud and rivaled only by the fans of the RedSox at Fenway.

30,Baseball stadium tour,"My son and I are in the midst of seeing all the stadiums in MLB. Dodger Stadium was #26 out of the 30.The good: It's the Dodgers and it's cool that it's the same place that Sandy Koufax pitched in the late 50's into the 60's and of course the 70's teams with Garvey and Lopes.The bad: It's a 60 year old stadium with no mass transit, so it was like reliving a nightmare from my childhood as it was taking over an hour to exit the parking lot with 40,000+ in their respective cars merging into singular lanes in a massive traffic jam.The stadium is OK, but it's not one of the cool, new ones recently built and it's no Fenway or Wrigley. I don't know what the answer is, but I guess they look at the rest of the country and say, ""hey, we live in LA and play in sunshine and 75 degrees all year, so take that"".",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/larrylegend28
50,Game day,I love the Dodger stadium. The best food so far is at the king's Hawaiian restaurant. They drinks are good. This stadium had better drinks and the Angel's stadium has better food. I really enjoy the fans the best. They are loyal and energetic. They really know how to rally and show the team that they are behind them!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/262shannonp
40,"A view of the diamond, a chance to buy merchandise, no lines & plenty of parking...","If you'd love to buy some Dodger's merchandise, see the stadium and not have the hassles of crowded parking, long lines and ridiculously over priced tickets, you can visit the stadium & gift shop any day of the year except Thanks Giving & Christmas Day.After checking that it was an away game, and that no concert was on, we just rocked up to a close parking spot, popped in to the gift shop (they have everything from $2 stationery to $859 rugs!). You can see the diamond, buy some merchandise, and be out in half an hour!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dromomaniac
50,Great place to watch a ballgame!,"Saw the Twins play the Dodgers Wednesday night, 26 July 2017. Sat in the Top Deck (the highest part of the stadium). I love to sit in the upper deck, somewhere behind home plate. It's the best place to see all of the action, and I definitely did. Weather was perfect. A slight breeze blew through the stadium.It's an older stadium, but it definitely has its charm. I liked the palm trees and the Union 76 sign behind the outfield, as I've seen so many times on TV. Great gift shop with quality (and expensive Dodgers souvenirs).Consider taking the Metro to the stadium. You will be sparing yourself much aggravation if you don't. The Metro goes to Union Station, then patrons transfer to a bus (Dodger Stadium Express) that gets priority from Union Station to the stadium. The traffic from Union Station to the stadium was horrendous, but the bus glided right through the traffic.If you are a baseball fan, you definitely will want to include a visit to Dodger Stadium during your trip to Los Angeles. You will not regret it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Disco_Man57
50,Blue Heaven on Earth,Nothing beats seeing a baseball game at Dodger Stadium (particularly this season). Very convenient to take the Dodger Stadium Express to and from Union Station. Free with ticket to the game.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MikeInClairemont
40,Good seats and great game,Sat in seats with in the highest level but still had a great viewPeople were nice and a lot of great food optionsIf you're ever in the area I recommend going to a game,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marfp6sru
50,Put this on your bucket list and get here!,"Dodger Stadium is currently the oldest park west of the Mississippi, and the third oldest park over all. It is the largest MLB stadium as well. If you even like baseball you need to come here. You can stand where history happened. The Dodger Dogs are great too and that comes from someone who doesn't like hot dog's. The garlic fries smelled like heaven but I was too glued to my seat to get up and get some. Next time I will make sure I do though. I've been told I really missed out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/routetoa
50,What a view!,"My Wife was completely in awe of the stadium.Its so huge and seating banked so high.We arrived early, parked for free in a street just outside the ground - where its perfectly legal to do so, just that only 100 or so cars could be along that stretch.We walked in had a hot dog and then checked out the seats and took some photos,The Dodger lost and gave up runs early which was a shame and damped the atmosphere (and of course you can see far much more of the action just watching on TV in a bar) but the big screens around the stadium helped.Its a really good place to go and quite a spectacle and good value for the ticket price.It was a blistering hot day, so be sure to take some Sun protection.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Top_Tourer_2009
40,Great night out watching baseball,"We were in LA on holiday and I booked tickets to see the Dodgers. A great experience to see my first game of baseball in the USA, unfortunately the Dodgers lost. Great atmosphere, food and drink expensive for what it was. The stadium was great and the organisation getting the traffic in and out of the stadium was fantastic.Depending on the day and time of the game watch out for travel time across LA to the stadium. Ours was a Friday evening game and it took 105 mins to travel from Venice Beach to the Stadium.Worth experiencing.",
50,Awesome Venue,"The setting is super cool. Mountains in the background and the views of downtown leaving the game are really neat. A must for a baseball fan. Don't forget to check out level 9, a must!",
50,Great night at the park,"This was our second trip to Dodger Stadium, and we took our 4 children for their first Dodgers game. I have been to a lot of baseball games all across the country, but this may have been the most enjoyable. Even though the Dodgers lost, the fans seemed relaxed and were having a great time. It was a different experience than most games on the East Coast, and it just seemed ""fun"". We sat about eight rows back in the outfield along the first base side, and really enjoyed it. The people around us were really nice. We paid for parking ahead of time to save $10, so make sure you do that. Getting out of the stadium wasn't bad, but it did take us over 2 hours to get there from Santa Monica, but I was warned that may happen. It was worth it.",
40,Nice Evening for baseball,"there is a nice feeling in the Dodger stadiums as the fun really do make the experience better than it is as baseball to me is kind of boring. I went to the all you can eat section and it was pretty good with unlimited drinks, dodger dogs, nachos, peanuts and popcorn. In the end it makes up for the prices. I would recommend buying your tickets through Stubhub as they are very cheap compared to the Dodgers site.",
40,A must do but silly money,Another LA 'Must do' but silly money for a baseball game that seems to be on every day for over a week!That said enjoyed whole experience and firework display at end was great - over 6 minutes long.,
50,Great fun and atmosphere,"This was our first time to Dodger stadium and it was super fun! Not only because they won, of course, but the employees were really helpful when asked to find out seats and at the concession stands. The fans are energetic and it was just a great time. The parking is kind of a mad house so I suggest arriving super early, or just a few minutes before the game starts.",
50,Classic West,"Great experience.Accesible, easily, by car.Had great seats and a cool experience during the Classic West festival.",
40,Fun time,"Great venue, food is good but overpriced. Spend the $$ to sit in low rows, very close to the action. Easy to get in. Getting out with Uber was a little challenging. One driver accepted our request then dropped us after 8 minutes because of traffic. Next one got their quick, you have to call and ask what parking spot they are in so you can find them. Worth seeing a game there, very passionate fans but friendly to outsiders. In our case the good guys lost.",
30,An enjoyable evening at the ballpark,"We visited Dodger's Stadium as part of our 2 week California trip where we went to games at 4 different baseball stadiums. It was my least favorite of the parks we visited. The stadium was well kept and the staff were friendly. Dodger stadium has a lot of baseball history. The negatives were all of the steps between levels. No ramps or escalators at the stadium, there is an elevator to help those with mobility issues. Dodger Stadium for us gets downgraded because of its fans. The fans in our section were obnoxious, the worst we encountered during our trip at the four stadiums we visited. Unless you want a Dodger Dog, you really have limited food choices. Every stand sells Dodger Dogs but you have to hunt & climb stairs for the stands that sell something else. The food was good. I loved the Dole Whip for dessert. The giant bobble heads were fun to see. We left before the end of the game to avoid the crowd getting out of the parking lot. Getting parked before the game was super easy.",
50,Let's go Dodgers,"Wow what an iconic stadium. First thing it's huge! So if you are buying tickets best to get low as you can go height wise or alternatively sit in the bleachers for cheap tickets.Easy to get to, it has a dedicated Uber pick up in lot 12. Best to wait till you are near before ordering as the walk can be 10 mins.",
50,Stadium withstands test of time,Can't find much to complain about. Great beer selection. Great food selection. Good sight lines. Tough to navigate from one level to another. Worth the trip.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Traveler98769876
50,A winner for Baseball or Concerts ~ Park Outside,"I have been here for both baseball and recently a couple of concerts. This is an iconic setting, a wide open park set in the canyon. Get a Dodger Dog and some Garlic Fries enjoy. Some Tips:Right field faces west into the setting sun, so afternoon events can be a bit sunny. Left field has the afternoon shade. If you want to save a bit (a lot) on parking and don't mind a little stroll, take ACADEMY and park for free along the road. Did that for two nights, not only did we save money, but we avoided the parking lot grid lock and drove right out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Seashark7
40,It is legendary,"Awesome venue, tough to get to if you don't take the free shuttle. I love to walk but, hey, it's up hill from virtually everywhere. This place is BIG, security is similar to an airport (so heads up trying to 'sneak' stuff in). If you've never been, prepare for $15 beers (that's 24 ounces so really two), pricey and limited food options, unrelenting sunshine and heatstroke if you're on the 'wrong' side of the stadium...I was there for the Classic West concerts, was very impressed by the great sound, video screens...not so much the concession prices and accessibility. Do your homework, figure out in advance your access, egress, food budget.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ydnar
50,The Classic West in a Great Venue,"FIRST - if you are going to an afternoon event, sit on the west side of the stadium - otherwise you are in direct sun and will fry. We got lucky by accident and were in the 6th row on the west side in the shade, pitying those to the east.SECOND - If you're going to have a Michelada or other cocktail, know that the bars are CRAZY and the bartenders do not have time to mind their lines. If you are at a large event, you can wait 30-40 minutes. Look to the ends of the bars, where a more natural line occurs. Have cash for tips - they don't include them on your receipt. And if you're inclined - have the Michelada, which is rightfully legendary here. They are huge, have a great mix, super spicy and cost about $23.GREAT STAFF - everyone we dealt with from the gate to the concessions to the ushers, was incredibly nice and professional. People were so helpful! Don't hesitate to ask for assistance, these people are great.WHAT CAN I SAY ABOUT THE SHOW? It was as amazing as we hoped! We came primarily for Steely Dan and Earth Wind & Fire...who both served it up in spades. The Eagles were particularly captivating, and Fleetwood Mac rocked. Thank you to all the bands! I feel very lucky, very fortunate to have that experience!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jays170
10,HORRIBLE WAIT FOR TRANSPORTATION OUT OF STADIUM!,We recently attended the Classic West concert on Saturday July 15th. The concert was excellent but trying to get a ride back to our hotel was a nightmare! See all the complaints on FB! Hoards of people waited for Taxi's - which never showed up. The bus line to Union Station was an hour long! Could not get an Uber and line at Uber station was ridiculous! The concert ended at about 11:30 PM and we did not arrive back to the hotel Omni until 1:45 AM and we were just a few miles away! Unacceptable public transportation around the stadium and needless to say we would never return to an event at Dodgers Stadium. See all the complaints on social media regarding the transportation for that event!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/matcait
50,Dodger's game,"We had a fantastic evening at a Dodger's game. We bought our tickets online. There was a good range of food, which we had fun exploring. The game was fun to watch and we enjoyed interacting with staff and the crowd. A great event if you are visiting!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/matakanamum
50,Best Away Game Experience,"My friends and I came here all the way from ATL to see our Braves play the Dodgers. It was a great game that the Braves won 6-3. The Dodger fans were great people and enjoyed talking to them through out the game. The stadium is super retro and has more character than any sports stadium I have been to. Food is great as well, must try is the world famous Dodger Dog.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/797zacharyt
40,Classic stadium,"As the third oldest MLB stadium, Dodger Stadium will delight passionately historical fans of the game. Its open air seating and scenery make this a memorable experience. Tributes to Tommy Lasorda, the Championship ring statues, and to Jackie Robinson are worth the admission. Traffic in and out of the stadium is atrocious (typical of all traffic in Los Angeles) and the food and beer choices are lackluster a compared the slew of modern era ballparks. In conclusion, a must see for the baseball historian.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jamiec733
50,What's not to love?,"LETS GO DODGERS! I love this stadium. It is clean, well groomed, and a beautiful environment. If you attend an evening game, you get to see the sun setting and it is amazing. Only downer about this stadium is the parking. WORK ON THE PARKING!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adrianla1331
50,Dodger Stadium,Great baseball stadium. If you like baseball is a must see place. Great history. Parking is 20 dollars in general area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C6776LQjaimec
50,If you like Baseball..........,To a lot of folks this is Mecca for the local fanatics. As you can guess I am not a fan.Now for some hints.It gets very warm here. So watch your Beer intake as the L.A.P.D. frowns on public drunkenness.The Fans can be rowdyThe Dodger Dogs taste great but are $$$$ Ditto for the beerThe place is well is set out and generally the staff are 1st rate and the place is pretty clean consideringBring $$$ as everything costsCome early and leave early to miss the infamous traffic jamsBe ready to have a hell of a good time,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidlB7915GV
50,Dodger game,The Dodger stadium has changed so much! For the better. Easy to get in and out. The lines for food and drink are much smaller. You feel safe with a lot of police presence. Note on day games try to sit on the 3rd base side... much cooler as your not sitting in the sun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SteveLalaE
30,"Good for baseball, maybe not so good for rock concert","Just attended Dodger Stadium for Classic West concert. Having recently moved to the left coast from Boston, I was sort of shocked by how anachronistic Dodger Stadium is. I think it would be a good venue for a ball game (how could the weather be bad?), but the food was horrendous and ridiculously priced (they seemed to sell out of 'healthy choices') , and the transportation, unless you drove, was poor. We took Uber the first night, and hundreds, if not more were stranded in the chaos after the show; we walked halfway back then got a cab for $50 for the last 1.5 miles. The second night, the Dodger Stadium Express had nary a bus until nearly an hour after the show for a return trip. The employees were nice but had no clue about buses, taxis, or anything useful. Interesting, but overall disappointing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jim_the_bike_racer
50,Must see ballpark,"Dodgers are not my favorite team, but I do like them...being in Dodger stadium as a baseball fan is a bucket-list item for me. I wore a Mets hat to the game, and no one harassed me, which is a plus! Lol! The people who work at the stadium were very nice, friendly and genuine! We were directed by a security guard to a place to get a ""First Time Visitor"" certificate. Ended up being a great game, with a walk off in the bottom of the 10th!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/metsfan2017
40,"Great outdoor venue, but difficult to get too without a car","Attended the Classic West concert which was AMAZING! We had great seats in the Field section (17) and lucky for us we had shade for the entire concert which was great. There is not any good public transportation option to get to the Stadium which was disappointing as our hotel was right next to a Metro spot. Both days we took an Uber to the stadium, but it was such a long line and wait to get in that we literally got out and walked about 1/2 mile from the line just to get into the stadium. All of the staff were friendly and helpful, but getting a better handle on the public transportation would be a plus for future large events.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/staceylevasseur
30,It's a baseball stadium,"It's crazy getting parked and worse trying to get out, with all the traffic! You want to sit in shade, if you can get it. Lots of food ops/variety, but why would you eat anything other than a hot dog, peanuts and popcorn, as the song goes?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JR125
50,Classic West,My family and I just attended Classic West and had an amazingly wonderful experience! All staff and security were friendly and helpful. The restrooms were very clean. This was surprising considering the amount of people that were at this concert. The beer lines went fast which was a major plus!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M2415QOlisal
20,OVERPRICED,"Evert hinge in this place from parking ,admission and food were totally absurd. 15.00 for a beer, 7.50 for an overcooked hot dog on a soggy bun, undercooked fries for 6.50. I could go on and on.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/282leej
40,The Classic West Concert,"The 2-day Classic West Concert at Dodgers stadium has been awesome. The seats are great, the food selection is average, and the parking is way over priced. What has impressed me the most is how quickly they are able to clear out the parking lot. Even with 50000 fans leaving at once, I was out of the lot and in the freeway in about 10 minutes. Kudos to the parking and traffic people in and around the stadium!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deamole
20,boring for me,"I am not a baseball fans, so it is quite boring. Although I know nothing about baseball, the tour guide explains everything in the stadium clearly. The explaination gives me a brief understanding about Dodgers and baseball.If you love baseball, you can go. If you dont, dont go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/852kwc
50,Excellent Venue,"For an evening/night out it's the place to go. Great family experience, bit pricey for food and drink but all part of the event. Great ""audience"" participation and great party atmosphere. Easy to get to by metro and free bus shuttle to Venue. Worth ro read up on history of place too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jckfxy
50,Great baseball atmosphere,"Don't let the third oldest MLB stadium fool you, you would hardly notice its age. The Chavez Ravine area is a beautiful area for the ballpark and there are some great views of the park and the city from the upper level. Being in town for the Freeway series added to the enthusiasm of the game. Great park!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BaseballTraveler16
50,do a dodgers game,we bought cheap tickets in Australia before we left - great seats always buy parking at stadium when you but your tickets if you are a first timer ask a friendly staff member where to get your special certificate as a free souvenir have a dodgers dog and an ice cream out of the players hat!! if your not sure what is going on the friendly locals will help. get ready to cheer with the organ and yell CHARGE!!!! Great fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/angwr
50,Blue Magic,"It's the third oldest stadium in Major League Baseball behind Wrigley in Chicago and Fenway in Boston. When it opened in 1962 it was the newest stadium in MLB. That's how much times have changed and haven't.Dodger Stadium is so intertwined with Los Angeles modern history - as is the historic relo of the Dodgers from Brooklyn to LA - it's almost impossible to describe in words. You have to feel it. You have to be there, perhaps multiple times, to grasp its full emotional significance.The food is lousy and expensive but it doesn't matter. They let you bring in your own food and one sealed bottle of water per person. That is a gift most stadiums don't allow. Another secret is that you can visit the top deck store on non-game days, walk out the open back door, and eat your own brown bag lunch in the stands, overlooking the gorgeous emerald field. You want to feel magic? That's magic.On game nights when it goes from light to dark, from no field lights to full field nights, you look out over the palm trees surrounding Chavez Ravine and remind yourself that prior to Dodger Stadium, palm trees and baseball did not mix. When MLB came to the west coast, the game became a truly national game with television and airline travel. With that came icons like Koufax and Drysdale, Fernandomania, Scully, and forever the spirit of #42 Jackie Robinson. It's all still there, and now Kershaw. You will feel west coast baseball as it should be: authentic, inspirational, and historic.If you can't make a game, take the tour. But you need to come to a game. You will be back. Dodger Stadium is part of our home.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CorporateIntel

50,A GREAT Ballpark!,"This is one of the nicest ballparks I've ever seen - in fact, I'd be hard-pressed to name one nicer, but everyone has their favorites, I'm sure (I'm a long-time Tigers fan & have visited perhaps a dozen or so over the years)...The tour was EXCELLENT & very informative - highly recommending this one!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/flatleyk
50,One of the best ballparks in the MLB,"I spent a Friday night at Dodger stadium when the Dodgers took on the Royals. The stadium itself is very nice and manages to look modern and classic all at the same time. The stadium was almost at capacity but the wait times at the concession stands were very low. There is a wide selection of food to choose from, including the famous Dodger dogs, which are a must try. After a great baseball game, we were treated to ""Friday Night Fireworks"", and witnessed a breathtaking fireworks show that lasted for over 10 minutes. If you are planning a trip to LA during the baseball season, definitely make sure you go see a Dodgers game, you won't regret it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kadenwisniowski
40,"So fun, so hot!","We sat in section 21 (third base side above dugout) on a Sunday afternoon game. Sunscreen sunscreen sunscreen!!!! Hat, Spray bottle to mist yourself, towel to wipe your sweat, sunscreen all a must! Did I mention sunscreen?!? Prepare yourself for a hot seat too (sat on a towel!!) with that said, great stadium, easy parking, and always a great game! Go Dodgers!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stephaniewJ1953DG
50,Keep your little kids at home,I was invited to a work event sponsored by Emirates Airlines in the BMW lounge. When you have free drinks and food in an air condition setting what more can you ask for. We had a great time but I wish parents would keep their little kids at home or take them to Chucky Cheese instead of bringing them to a game they don't understand.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Creeping_Death_LA
40,Play ball!,"As fans of the visiting team, we were impressed with the helpful and friendly staff.Purchased our tickets from independent ticket site and had no problem with our mobile tickets at the gate.Security checkpoints were run smoothly and efficiently.Lyft driver dropped us off at parking gate on third base side and it was a short walk to entrance.If you're going to a 4pm game, highly recommend the third base side for shade - first base side is full on ☀️.Be prepared for expensive concessions - $9 large soda, $16 beers - ouch!Although antiquated, Everything was clean.Feeling of nostalgia being in an older stadium, but can't imagine thats worth sitting on bleachers in the outfield.Upon exiting there is an Uber pickup area that is well marked - we however decided to walk short distance (2.4 miles) to our daughters apt. Lots of local fans were departing on foot as well, so that was nice to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ruvtoeatpetfriendly
50,DODGERSSSSS BASEBALLLLLLL,"I was here the last day Vin was doing the Announcements. it was awesome! There were some annoying people around us where we sat, but people are always annoying. Play ball! PS, garlic fries will make you immune to vampires for the rest of your life.",
40,Great fun and an 'authentic' experience,"We saw the Dodgers vs the NY Mets, great entertainment and good to do something that the locals do so very authentic experience. Getting there and back is a nightmare, we used Uber which was Ok and would recommend this if you are going.We had a great family night out, good game to watch and all in an enjoyable event.",
40,Huge park-get there early!,"The park itself was great. It was huge and the atmosphere was great. My wife and I are Red Sox fans so we understand the fans passion. The amenities inside didn't match the parks luster. The lines were long no matter when you stood in them and the worst part was getting in. You have to get there more than an hour early or you will be waiting in your car to get a parking spot. Also, they don't have definitive driving lanes getting up the hill to the park, at least until you get to the main parking area. Because of that it is somewhat of a free for all to get up the hill. That and the random people trying to sell you dodger gear heading to your parking spot was kind of a turn off. All in all a good time though.",
40,Classic ballpark,"Enjoyed our visit to Dodger Stadium. Third oldest ballpark in the majors, behind only Fenway and Wrigley. Bought parking online and saved money. Acres of parking, so you may have a little walk to the field. Nice setting among the hills.Team is playing well, with some very good young talent.Prices for food and drinks are high, as expected with a MLB ballpark, but they will allow you to bring in food and water, so take advantage of that.",
50,A true blue fan,"Spend a day and enjoy the !st place Dodger team. They will not disappoint, the team is the best they have been in years with a lot of young talent. Best to order tickets on line and have a great day for the whole family.",
50,"Dodger parking tip, awesome game and stadium","Dodger's are awesome this year and the stadium is packed. So, here is one thing you can do to help with parking and getting in and out of the lots. Buy your parking ticket on-line, you'll save $5.00. Print the paper, don't worry about the lot #, it doesn't matter. Get on Sunset, turn onto Vin Scully Drive, takes you into the stadium, get into the right 2 lanes, at first they may seem slow, but it will move, the entrance to prepaid parking in on the right side (2 booths) as you enter the stadium, little to no lines! Everyone else on the left is paying to park, but for you, they just scan your paper. Then stay to the right, there is primo parking spot on the right side that is fairly empty and close. To get out, they direct you towards the freeway/Chinatown, we went to Hill Street and downtown. Have fun! Go DODGER'S!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeffBransford

40,Classic ball diamond,One of the great classics for taking in a ball game. Outside the stadium there are a lot of photo ops. Parking is outside the stadium and can be a bit of a walk in. Book on-line for a reduced price. Water bottles that are not open can be taken in the stadium.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NormLWat
30,"We won, but very expensive low grade food and beverages","Family of five going for their first game. Uber transport worked really well, as did getting in. The searching of bags gives confidence in the safety. The seats on the top deck gave a good view for the cost. However, the cost of in excess of $250 for food etc was exceedingly high and not a good quality.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChrisandJulieM
40,Pricey but a great experience,"I came here for a baseball game in late May and overall I was impressed with Dodgers Stadium, the atmosphere was great and the stadium offered great views over the surrounding area.The only downside was the price of the tickets which is considerably more expensive then the equivalent tickets at Angel Stadium which is the other baseball stadium in the Los Angeles area.If you get public transport to Dodgers Stadium I would recommend it as it takes a long time to leave the ground and parking is expensive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JXXXR
40,Great ballpark,"First time at a Dodgers game and it was to see them against the Angels in the Freeway series.The ballpark it nice with a touch of old tine park mixed in. Plenty of concessions available all around the park and there is free wifi for the kids if they get bored.The food and drink pices are a bit high. Highest I have ever paid at a ballpark. Not sure if you are permitted to take your own into the park, but if you are, then I would seriously consider doing so. $14 for a beer and $8 for a dog.Great place and great atmosphere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kenwyoung
40,Bring your own food!,"Coming from the East Coast, we had not been to Dodger Stadium for about 30 years. The stadium is a great example of 1960's baseball stadium architecture, with a nod to its Southern California roots ina lovely setting. As with most ball parks, the food was largely forgettable (I had the Dodger Dog) and vastly overpriced. Unlike many ball parks, you can bring in your own food, and I would encouarge you to do so. We left after the 8th inning and traffic was minimal.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lestroyens
50,Dodger fans are the best!,"Although my husband had his Mets shirt and ball cap on, the Dodger fans couldn't of been more friendly and fun! The stadium is one big circle that does not take very long to walk around and there were fun things to do like get a shot of tequila for free, pose with a mascot or get a picture with the girls by the race car. The second floor has lots of Dodgers pictures and memorabilia as well. The food at the stands are somewhat limited with not a huge vairiety like some of the newer stadiums provide, but it's Dodger stadium, so who cares? Love the ""kiss cam"" and ""dancing cam"", but wear your Dodgers stuff if you want to get on it, or bring a funny kid with you. Plenty of places to get a beer and a mixed drink station was near us. Only one place served wine that we could find and it's very limited, Woodbridge, either Chardonnay or a Cabernet. It would be nice to have a little better selection of wine for the ladies! They also have a very large store to pick up a Dodgers jersey, but they are not cheap. I wish they sold bobble heads! Go early so you can take it all in!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CampingKatie
50,"mid-century modern classic, great baseball","Went for a game, was surprised how much I liked the stadium. I'm a sucker for the historical parks, and this one is classic 50s all the way. It's easy to navigate and had one of the best food/drink selections I've seen in a park. They also have somehow managed to run it so I never seemed to stand in line for an entire inning to get a beer. Took 5 minutes tops. Great views of LA too. Pain to get to!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tarzan2613
40,It is possible to walk there.,"My husband and I stayed in downtown LA and wanted to see the Dodgers v. Mets. We love to walk to see the sights. We were the only walkers we passed on our way up to the stadium and after the game. I just want others to know that it is possible to walk (even though I know LA is not known for walking.) However, there are no signs to help you along the way. Our trusty map and following the line of cars up to the parking are how we found our way.The drinks are way overpriced, but that is the way it is these days.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/avidwalker
50,Dodgers Vs. Nats day game,"I was a bit hesitant to go to a game at Dodger stadium because it is an ""older"" stadium and I wasn't sure what the experience would be like. Parking was easy and I think that the seat I bought for $23 had a great view. The ball park was really nice and people were friendly. Only negative part of the day was the guy that passed out and died outside of the stadium, but those things happen. Overall, a real enjoyable experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elliottc583
40,Good fun,"Relaxed atmosphere and enjoyable even if you know nothing about baseball. Book parking in advance as it's half price. We left slightly before the end and leaving the car park was straightforward.Food and drink is on the pricey side, particularly the beer which was $15. You can bring in your own food and sealed soft drinks bottles so strongly recommend that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wombling_Free_7548
50,LA Dodgers vs NY Mets,"My family (we are from Australia) and I went to our first American baseball game on the 22nd June 2017 at dodger stadium and loved it! The stadium was clean and seemed in good condition with plenty of food options and amenities. Stadium seats were comfy, our seats had a great view and we loved the crowd interaction that was encouraged throughout the game. We were quite worried before the game about parking but that was so well organised and we had no issues or line ups getting in and out. Fabulous first place to visit for our first American baseball game.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carlyjasmin
50,Mets vs Dodgers,"Being from NY, we went to see the Mets play the Dodgers. Dodger Stadium is quite a nice stadium. Modern, clean and comfortable. Though the Mets lost, they did make it an exciting game.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jewels200
40,America's Pastime - Baseball!,"I'm a huge baseball fan, and Dodgers Stadium is the 4th stadium I've been to in the past year. It has that old school feel (think early 1960's, considering it opened in 1962....) which gives it tons of character. They've attempted to make some upgrades while maintaining the old school feel, which has its pro's and cons. Con: there is very minimal shade. Besides the concourse, I'm not sure we found shade anywhere else. Pro: there aren't any bad seats. Con: the concourse areas are small, and when everyone is trying to get out, its kind of hectic, especially with the pop up vendors still having their carts lining the walls. Pro: Dodger dogs!They'll take your photo for you when you walk in the gate and deliver it to you by the 4th (I think) inning, when you can decide if you'd like to purchase it. I've never encountered this at any other stadium, so this was cool to me. They don't, however, do same-day game used memorabilia like the other stadiums I've been to, which is a bummer. Being able to purchase something that is game used while you're still there is pretty awesome, so I'd like to see them add this in the future. Everyone was super friendly and helpful, which you don't always find at events / ball parks. I'd definitely go back to catch a game.We took an Uber to the stadium, so I can't speak on the parking situation, but I do know that you can catch a bus from Union Station in LA that brings you directly to the stadium and then it picks you up and brings you back to Union Station after the game - all for free if you have a ticket to the game. So I'd definitely recommend this option.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/catchthis0905
50,What a fun day at the ballpark,I have to say be prepared for EXPENSIVE beer. But besides that the stadium is amazing. Good parking system. Quick food and drink lines.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dayea
50,Upper Deck and sunny,"We had plenty of sun, but we were near enough to concessions to take advantage of short lines any time we wanted drinks and snacks. Our view of the action and the surrounding city was perfect too. We paid a little extra for premium parking and that was totally worth it.It made getting in and out much easier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeneralRikard
40,19th June 2017,Had a great night. Dodgers won over Mets and we even understand a few rules. Ate dodger dog as recommended - OK. Difficult getting home due to über area long way from wifi and we don't have phone for USA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shanih11
50,Great stadium!,"I travel to all of America's ballparks and thought this one was great! Lots of food choices, bar areas, areas to explore. Worth checking out if you are visiting LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kkolodz
50,Parking At Dodger Stadium,"You have your ticket. What about parking? if you don't have a parking pass, go to the official Dodger buy parking web site. You will save $10.00 for GA parking, which you can use to buy a Dodger dog and soda.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelinAlan
40,Great view from the top deck,"Seeing all the MLB ball parks was always a thought, but of course if it's just a thought it doesn't rank high for priorities. This one makes 6. Make sure you check the weather because it was very cold from the top deck.",
40,Go dodgers,First time at a baseball game. Loved the atmosphere but it's a bit slow at times. Probably one of the best teams to see and loved that so many families are there.,
30,Nice older ball park with great views,Dodger Stadium is a nice ball park for an older facility. Beautiful setting but needs to be updated & food selection isn't very good for a major league park.,
30,Being the visiting team fan,"Well LA is definitely not Philly although there was one fan who heckled me like Philly heckles visitors. Citizens Bank Park allows fans to get field access until approximately 30 minutes before the game, that's not the case here. So,if you want to get some autographs get there at least 90 minutes prior. The food and beverage selection was very good but the prices will cause sticker shock if you are used to East Coast pricing. Our seats were great, along the first base line. They were in the shade too. If you are in LA and your team is visiting its well with the traffic.",
50,Go Dodgers,"Had to catch a ball game while in LA, it just so happened there was one on!! Bought the tickets from stubhub and had great seats - the atmosphere was good, friendly, very family orientated and just relaxed and fun. Would go back...! :)",
50,So much fun,"Wanted to visit an American baseball game and there is no better place than this. Lots of supporters and cheering for this grand game. And then there is the beer and hotdogs, but didn't go as far as having peanuts. For an American must see, go watch the LA Dodgers in their home turf.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KdofMelb
40,A Must,"Our group has hit all of the ballparks and we loved the history and the views. It's showing its age, of course, and doesn't have much of the finery that the newer stadiums do, but you've got to visit. Bring your walking shoes - parking is a hike.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ace4444
50,First Time Visit - Wow what history!,"Wife and I visited Dodger Stadium for the very first time as my Cubs visited for a weekend set. Although I knew that getting and leaving the ballpark would be a nightmare with LA traffic, the time spent between that was incredible.While not being a Dodger fan, it seemed that quite a bit of my baseball memories involved the history of this iconic ballpark. Seats were in the upper deck, first base side. Doesn't seem to be a bad seat in the house, however. Dodger fans were very welcoming and cordial. Is it just me or did I not notice any ushers here? Food prices are expensive, but that is expected.When my Cubs or wife's White Sox visit Dodger Stadium again, we will return! One of my favorite MLB places to see a game!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/parrisf2015
50,Great Baseball Cathedral,"Took my kids, all under 10, to their first baseball game this month. Dodgers Stadium is still beautiful as ever. The food is okay and it feels a little worn in the nose bleeds but theirs a nostalgia about that place u can't replicate.Tips:- Buy the parking online, saves have 50%- The entrance on Hill is the best find I've had. Normally I exit the 5 and pass the Academy, but the Downtown entrance is much faster.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OrangeCountyJay

50,I've been to close to 25 stadiums; Dodger Stadium is a classic!,"Been going to Dodger Stadium since I was a kid. They've made great improvements to food offerings. It was a fun, friendly atmosphere. If you're looking to save money, it's awesome they let you take in food and water. Only downside is parking can be a pain. Plus, unlike the new parks, Dodger Stadium is within walking distance of hotels, bars and restaurants.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RichardLevel23
40,Game time...,"Continuing with my quest to visit as many stadiums and ball parks as possible.... with all the Brooklyn and LA history, I had to visit Dodger stadium. The positives... beautiful for an older park, great view of the hills, great sight lines and easy access to all levels (if you don't mind stairs as escalators can be very busy). The negatives... terrible parking setup, other parks such as Anaheim put LA to shame. The parking is made worse by the location of the park meaning you can't avoid LA rush hour. Another negative is the food, one of the worse hotdogs I have had at 16 different parks. Another negative is the prices, typical LA...be prepared to pay $50+ for two beers, two hotdogs and some chicken tenders.If you are a baseball fan then go once for the experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Husky2008
50,Historic Dodger Stadium,"I enjoy seeing new baseball stadiums every year (especially older ball parks). Dodger Stadium was on my list, as it is the 3rd oldest ball park in the majors.I decided to take the tour of the stadium. and it was one of the more enjoyable tours I have taken thus far. The tour lasts 90 minutes, and you get to see areas of the stadium, sit in the Dodger's dugout, step on to the field dirt only), plus see all the awards etc. I highly recommend the tour (Dodger fan or not).The seats I had for both games were great, I honestly do not believe there is a bad seat anywhere. They have a good selection of concessions, and I did not think the beer selection was bad either. The Dodger Dog was very delicious, and it was recommended by the stadium tour guide.I would visit this ball park again for sure!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lhoward53
50,Great atmosphere,Great atmosphere. Would really recommend visiting for a game if in the area for a true American experience. Great atmosphere on a Friday evening with fireworks at the end to top it off. Loved it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoelZoe1
40,Great time!,"While in LA the Dodgers were playing so decided to catch a game. Traffic was horrible getting there, went on a Thursday night, so suggest allowing yourself plenty of extra time getting there. Had the nachos (in the hat) & was very disappointed. The cheese really didn't have a flavor, very bland. All the employees were nice & helpful!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cpc2177
30,Incredibly difficult to get in to when seeing a concert,"While the venue itself was great for seeing the U2 concert recently, trying to get to the Rose Bowl and part are entirely different matters. We left Orange County at 1:30pm, got to our hotel at just before 4pm, left the hotel - which was 6.2 miles from the Rose Bowl at 6pm, made it to our seats at 8:30pm for an 8:45pm concert start. Crazy! We literally parked on the 9th hole about a mile out from the gates of the Rose Bowl. Don't know if we will ever/need to ever see another event at the Rose Bowl, but we did it and checked it off the list!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/480debbiec
50,Dodger fan from Michigan,Absolutely loved going to the stadium. Found it easy I get in and out. We got there early and left after the game was over. Ticket prices varied from under $10 up to astronomical prices. Can't really go wrong not a bad view in the house. The seats are aged but not uncomfortable. The age is expected since it is the 3rd oldest park in the MLB. My wife went in for our first Dodger home game and guests services gave us a little certificate. And since we mentioned it was our 10th wedding anniversary they gave us a ball from batting practice. My one complaint is that the do not allow fans access to the wall for autographs. I've been to 4 ball parks in the mid west over the last few years and all of them allow fans access to the wall near the dugouts up to a certain point till game time. Oh one more complaint...regular draft beer $12 and $14 for a premium beer!!Earlier in the morning we came to the stadium for a tour. Highly recommend taking the tour. Getting to be in the dugout and on the field (dirt only) was amazing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T126UTjamesg
40,Great Ball Park But,"Too big a venue for concerts.. It's easy to get good seats but nearly impossible to see the teensy figures on the stage. It does have better acoustics than I would have expected and the music of Billy Joel was great, but even the jumbo screens were hard to see. My seats were above the home team dugout and Billy was set up in centerfield.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/N5676OFvaleriec

50,Ebbetts Field in 1957 and now Dodger Stadium in 2017.,"Yes it was a long wait for me to get to Dodger Stadium, I grew up in Brooklyn and saw them when I was 10 years old. It has taken me 60 years to catch up, and well worth it. Don't wait as long as I did.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GraceS03
20,A Night At Dodger Stadium,Its a beautiful day for a Ball Game at Dodger Stadium except for the food & drinks cocktail 11:50 in a plastic cup no less!!! A bottle of water $5.00 The game was GREAT The stadium is beautiful but they over charge on everything possible.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/markeA5483RR
30,"Go VERY early, traffic terrible","Considering the fact that there are 81 games a year, the flow of traffic for parking was very disorganized and slow. We missed 3 innings!Food in upper deck was poorGood site lines, seats ok, very few attendants to guide first time visitorsBut still worth visiting",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OntarioCanuck1
30,Probably a better baseball venue than a concert venue,Not an ideal venue for concerts as only field level seats would have a good vantage point in seeing the performer. My largest disappointment was the food. We had a couple of ball park dogs added with a couple of beers for $40. I can tolerate the high price of beer but the hot dogs were extremely disappointing. You typically don't expect much from a hot dog but this was the wurst we ever had. The stadium was relatively easy to get to via Uber. I was hoping to walk from downtown but our hotel didn't recommend it. Getting there was much easier than getting out.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/matthewsJ2596IH
40,Dodgers home game,As visitors from UK it was a fun evening at the game. Very organised getting in and out of the stadium.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/susanb54
50,"Great place to see a ballgame, but hard to get to...","Getting to Dodger Stadium by public transit (and I imagine driving there too) was a chore. I was staying in Hollywood so I went to Union Station and caught the Dodger Express! Just the fact this exists is amazing! But I've used it twice and it could be better, as the drivers having to navigate LA traffic is tough I'm sure. The last time I used the Express we were late and it was the 3rd inning before we got there cause traffic was so backed up. Not necessarily the driver's fault but there were alot of angry folks on the bus...so go early! The actual stadium is history itself, with no bad seats at all. On a beautiful day just sitting there enjoying the LA weather and a ball game is an amazing experience! And then getting home was another story...but like I said, Kudos to the fact the Dodgers try hard to get their fans to the game!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chrismQ4711XU
50,One of Baseball's Classics,"Dodgers Stadium is the 14th MLB stadium I've visited. I'll admit, I never was too keen on visiting it - it looked just average on TV despite how highly esteemed it generally was by others. So I was really surprised with just how much I really liked it. In fact, I would rank it amongst the Top 3 I've visited so far.A few things that really stick out about this ballpark:1) Location: it's hard to believe that Dodgers Stadium is located just outside downtown L.A. Nestled in the hills of Chavez Ravine, Dodgers Stadium has one of the more unique settings in sports - surrounded by green hills and palm trees yet just minutes away from one of the largest urban areas (w/ some of the worst traffic) in the world. This is a refreshing change from many of the ballparks built in the last 20+ years which were built downtown and tried to feature the skyline in the background - after awhile, this approach became too commonplace. Taking in a game at Dodgers Stadium makes you feel like you've traveled to a tranquil suburban setting when, in fact, ever-bustling Interstate 5 is right outside.Also, the view of downtown L.A. is pretty top notch from the parking lot (speaking of parking, I highly recommend pre-paying for it online to save up to 50%).2) Aesthetics: Also hard to believe this stadium is 55 years old. Granted, there have been renovations over the years, but the ballpark has held up remarkably well after so many years. The distinct light blue walls and different colored seats are a unique touch which set this apart from so many ballparks that overdo dark green (green walls, green seats, etc...). I also was surprised at how simple the stadium was in regards to amenities - no 3 levels of luxury seats, amusement park rides, breweries, video games, or numerous other distractions meant to separate you from your money(at least that I noticed). Just a simple approach that all you need is a beautiful setting featuring baseball and a hot dog.....3) Dodger Dog: I always figured the Dodger Dog was an over-hyped product of Californians looking for a way to compete with the classic cuisine of cities like New York and Chicago. I was wrong. This was one tasty hot dog, probably the best I've had at any ballpark. It's deserving of its reputation. Keeping with the simple approach of the rest of the stadium, the remaining concessions didn't go overboard with options. Sure, there were some healthier options and non-traditional fare (like sushi) that you'll find at most ballparks these days, but for the most part, it's all about the Dodger Dog. Concession lines were remarkably short despite the 40,000+ attendance.4) Atmosphere: Dodgers fans have that unfortunate reputation as late arrivals and early departures; however, the atmosphere at Dodger Stadium was pretty impressive. Yes, there is ""The Wave"" and beach balls, but the generalization of ""L.A. cool"" was not really present - most fans were into the game and there were numerous die-hards who knew their baseball. The sound system and video boards were also top-notch.Criticisms of Dodgers Stadium? It can be a pain to reach due to that infamous L.A. traffic, but that's true of anywhere near the city. Concessions can be on the high side, but that's true of every professional sports venue. Some seats can be far removed from the field, but that's to be expected with the largest stadium in MLB. The seating arrangement can be a little odd (odd-numbered sections on one side and even-numbered on the other), but it's an easy adaptation.Between its unique location, beautiful facility amidst classic southern California sunshine, and straightforward ""baseball-only"" approach, Dodgers Stadium is definitely deserving of its reputation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Panda_Bear_Will
50,"Palm trees, sunshine, hot dogs and Dodger baseball","Attended Opening Day 2017 - Train to Union station, then bus ride to Dodger stadium. Bus ride to and from the stadium will be lengthy (plan accordingly especially if bottom of 9th). Experience was amazing - strong national anthem, great atmosphere especially during home runs. Have a Budweiser and Dodger dog (pricey but must do). Try and get tickets in the top deck to see the park backdrop and bring sun protection if a day game as barely any shade in the stadium.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Andrew0905au
40,Baseball Game,"Went to my first baseball game here and enjoyed it! Had a Dodger Dog, got to see a man propose to his girlfriend on the big screen and enjoyed the game. It did help that I was with friends who could explain the rules to me though. And the merchandise is just a bit too expensive for me. Otherwise I had a great trip",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bmflynn
40,Alittle bit slow for us.,"Whilst in L.A had to do a USA sporting occasion, NFL was in closed season so picked a baseball game to attend. public transport was the best way around L.A so we were told to arrive at Union station for the free shuttle to the stadium. All went well and we found our seats after buying a $7 hotdog (Ripped off) we sat down to enjoy the game. Sorry my American friend but baseball is so slow(even the Americans were all on the food and drink level getting drunk and talking with friend instead of being sat in their seats watching the game) after 5 ends we left. We missed the rush and was back in the bar in Downtown in 30 mins. Great place, glad we seen the Dodgers stadium, the transport is fantastic to and from the game.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Arran2804
30,Was just ok,"We wanted to see Dodger Stadium and take in a game and had pretty decent seats for this game. Stadium was a let down, have been to numerous stadiums and this one is least favorite so far. I realize this is a historic stadium but really expected more, not much energy at game. Had to get a famous Dodger dog which was just a normal hot dog that is WAAAAy overpriced and $10 for a diet coke was just crazy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gcamp13

40,Dream come true...,"I grew up a Braves fan and always loved staying up late to watch the Dodger games from Chavez Ravine. I visited the stadium in the 80's but only to see the outside as it was closed at the time.To finally visit and attend a game here was a real treat and it did not disappoint! The game was over in the 1st inning after a grand slam made it 5-0 but that didn't matter because the Dodger Dogs and beer were more than enough entertainment! If that wasn't enough the fans were entertaining as well. I always heard the fans arrive late and leave early in LA, but there were plenty of fans, and a good turnout when I arrived for the start of the game. The fans were really into the game and I imagine they have a very loyal and enthusiastic following!It's a beautiful ballpark and the newly installed Jackie Robinson statue is incredible. Anyone, including non-fans would enjoy this experience! A dog and a beer will costs you $20!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/econotraveller41

40,Take the bad with the good,I have been to Chavez Ravine before but I haven't gone in years. Huge Dodgers fan from the time I was a kid and I had heard they improved the stadium so on short notice I took my wife and son to a game.Got tickets at the front gate which was a good experience overall but I bought all you can eat tickets in the right field pavilion and didn't know it. So I paid for concessions and didn't have to. Would have been nice for the ticket seller or the ticket taker or the concession stand to mention it but to be honest that level of customer service at this stadium would have surprised me. Would have been nice though.The game was a great game but the seats in the pavilion are still way too densely packed and really uncomfortable. Everyone at the dodgers shows up late and leaves early and buys beer every other inning so my family and I had to get up and down at least twenty times (no exaggeration).Overall this review won't stop Dodgers fans from attending as they are very dedicated fans and don't mind having minimum customer service and being uncomfortable but with the great quality they put on the field and for the high price of tickets there should be a lot more energy put into making the fans happier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/frodolives11954
40,A Classic MLB Experience,"The LA Dodgers are a MLB club so rich in history that it would be hard for a true baseball fan to not enjoy the sights and sounds of this historic park. I took one point away because locating my general admission parking spot with staff help was still way too stressful, and then finding an exit when the game was over was also harder than it should have been.I would go back, but I love baseball, too. 😎👍🏼",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/497AndyB497

50,My favorite stadium! Go Dodgers!,"To be fair--I'm a huge Dodgers fan but this is a honest review! I have been to several stadiums and this one is the best I've seen in my opinion! Nothing like catching a game at the ravine. Sit on the 3rd baseline for shade. Those are odd numbered sections. The outfield bleachers can be rowdy but lots of fun. Pay for parking on the website before you go and it saves you $10! Also for anyone with mobility issues (or small, tired children). they have many little golf carts with Helpful Honda drivers that will drive you to your car at the end of the night. That's a great service to some who probably really need it. Take in a game if you have the opportunity and Go Dodgers!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AngelaM0310

Don't fail to get a fried Dodger dog !,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Josie053
50,Great first time visit!,Went with family for two games. Great experience. Parking only $20 which I thought was cheap for being in LA. I had handicap sticker so parked right outside the gate both times. Allowed to bring in own unopened water or gatorade which saves a few bucks. Dodger Dogs great but $9.75.

50,"Exciting, cheap memorable four hours","Went to a matinee game of the Dodgers playing the Padres. The seats are very reasonable a lot cheaper than football match tickets, and you're there for longer. If you buy a ticket online you can catch a free bus from union station. You can catch a bus and walk up the hill to the ballpark. There are many food and drink stalls around each tier of the park and toilets. Usually some other entertainment as well as the main game.There is an on site team shop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/devoir
40,Always Love Coming to This Park!,"I've been coming to this park since I was a little girl. I loved going with my Dad to watch the Dodgers play and getting to eat Dodger Dogs. I found and married a Dodger fan in Giants territory. He had never been to a Dodger game. I bought tickets for his birthday and we took the kids to go watch the Dodgers play. I love this stadium. The kids loved the free bobble head, Dodger Dogs, and the fireworks. The worst part about the stadium is getting there. Traffic is always so bad. Our hotel was 5 minutes away without traffic and almost an hour trying to get to the game. Make sure you plan on traffic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H1445XEdebbiem
50,Wonderful day out!,"Great day. The crowd were really fun and all the activities are good to be part of. The game was exciting. Audience participation is high. We felt really safe and saw no signs of negative activity at all. We repeatedly heard it was more dangerous at night. Tickets are pretty cheap even for good tickets.We hired a driver from Anaheim, cost about $200 return for a people mover.The food was expensive in general but the dodger dog was only $6 and delicious. Beer was expensive $14 for the cheapest. and other drinks were either non existent or expensive. We just decided not to drink. Wasn't worth it.They were kind to kids handing out posters and stickers. It was a really fun day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ktzeller
50,First baseball game,Really enjoyed our trip. Tickets were super cheap and the stadium was fantastic. Very central. Free shuttle bus from downtown. The beers were crazy expensive. Cost 14 dollars which equated to £12 at the time! Dodger dog was a must and not too badly priced although still about a fiver!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmieCa

50,Great Tour & History of Baseball,"We love baseball and always enjoy seeing the different ballparks around the country. So, when we had the opportunity to tour Dodger Stadium we decided to check it out. Pam was a wonderful tour guide and we really enjoyed learning more about the history of the ballpark and the team. It was a great experience and we're really happy we did it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robkR5221MU
40,Iconic---- if only they treated it that way,"I bought great tickets behind the catcher, and saw Brian Glazer (wearing wild socks) and Pat Sajak at the game. I sat with an interesting group of people and really enjoyed the game, the conversation, and the ambiance of the game (including Vin Sculley at the 7th inning stretch!). Unfortunately the gulls had been nesting in several of the cup holders and I had a dickens of a time getting the staff to clean up the feathers and goo (icch) around the cup holders and around the seats. The locals seemed surprised that I made a fuss, but for the price I paid for tickets, a clean seat and environment is a bare minimum. The Brooklyn Dodger Dogs were both cheap and awesome. There is a shuttle to/from the game to/from Union Station that I recommend. This is an iconic (bucket list) stadium that needs better maintenance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/daviddD3505IR

50,One of America's most famous Ballparks,"Dodger Stadium is famous nationwide for its look and its location. It sits atop a hill with an excellent view of downtown Los Angeles. The dugout club is an excellent fan experience with food and drinks, but going to a Dodger game should be a must-do while in LA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/connorkern
40,Welcome to Dodger Stadium!,"My grandfather was a long time Brooklyn Dodger fan, so I don't know how he would have felt about me visiting the stadium of the team who betrayed him, but, it's still a stadium we needed to visit! Cross park five off the list!My boyfriend and I figured we'd buy our tickets when we got to the stadium. Bad idea. It was an inner league game, against the Padres, and it was totally sold out. However, we didn't realize that until we were in bumper to bumper stadium traffic, without a way to turn around. I was so disappointed! We came all the way there, and now we weren't even going to see a game! And then... a man with two woman came up to us and asked us if we wanted to buy tickets. I'm from new york, I get sketched out easily, wonder if someone is trying to scam me. My boyfriend? He's from Jersey, so he's a little more open minded. Well! As it turns out, they really did have legit tickets they were trying to get rid of. They were super nice and patient (we had to paypal them), and we were in!Despite the fact that Dodger stadium was built in the 60's, it is the third oldest stadiums, so that's pretty cool. The history the stadium has, you can see it and feel it. Despite the fact that it's an older stadium, it's definitely a family park. You'll see lines of people lines up to take pictures of all the different items around the park. My boyfriend and I thought it would be a bit dangerous, but we did feel safe the entire time we were there.I'd suggest if you have scoped out certain foods that you want, get on line asap, food lines (except the brooklyn pizza, which does not look like brooklyn pizza at ALL) were LONG! We had planned on getting the nachos in a helmet that seem to be a hit, but the line was massive! No nachos for us. We went at the end of May, and it was actually pretty cold. I thought LA would be warmer!We enjoyed our time. It's one of my boyfriends favorite stadiums. We will be back!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mangosong

50,A must visit during Baseball Season!,I went to see 2 games during the last season in July sitting in a different part of the stadium each time.Although baseball is a very slow game as a tourist & non American i really enjoyed the experience.Prices do vary a lot like in most American sports but even if you are on a budget you should be able to find tickets in your price range.The stadium had a good range of food.Parking was easy but expensive although if you use Uber they have a dedicated area for picking up after the game which makes getting away a little easier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JevesUK
50,Historic Ballpark - A Must See,"I visited Dodger Stadium on two consecutive days - the first for the championship game of the World Baseball Classic between the United States and Puerto Rico, and the second for a tour of the stadium and its facilities. I greatly enjoyed my experience during both visits. Dodger Stadium boasts a beautiful field, and holds over 56,000 spectators. During the World Baseball Classic Championship game, the atmosphere was beyond incredible, and I truly enjoyed the fact the I was able to have a great view of the field at all time, even when I had to leave my seat and walk through the concourse. The tour was also a great experience, and the knowledgeable and friendly tour guide gave a comprehensive overview of the stadium's and team's histories, and took us behind the scenes and onto the field. I would definitely recommend visiting Dodger Stadium on your next visit to LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/610elank
50,Easy access Stadium,"ご存知の通りドジャースタジアムはロスのダウンタウンにあり、渡航者にとっては嬉しいです。Gゲートから入場すると、まもなくフィールドが見えました。階段や並ぶこともなく快適でした。As you know, here is located at downtown in LA. It's nice location for travelers. After I entered the stadium from Gate G, I got to level 1, and could see field soon. No stairs and no long walking to see were welcome to me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kazuakim2015
50,Absolutely Incredible,We went to the tour of Dodger Stadium and it was incredible. They took us into where Vin Scully sits during games and to the private rooms. We went where they hold the trophies and awards and to the old locker rooms as well as the dug out and on the field! I would definitely recommend this for big Dodger fans or even general baseball fans.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/552arir
30,GnR,I came to the home of the Dodgers to see GunsNRoses and it was pretty darn good even though I couldn't see a thing.

Been there done that NEXT experience please!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/436stug
50,Bucketlist check!,"I love baseball. Being from Vancouver, BC, I have to go to safeco field for my fix. I always thought that was a great building, until my visit to dodger stadium. The night before my dodger experience, I saw my 2nd favourite AL team at Oakland Coliseum. I feel bad for the fans and the A's, because that stadium needs to go. So, walking into dodger stadium the next night was a relief. Mind you the cost of my a's tickets the night before was 10 rows up from home plate, which cost the same as my upper tier tickets at the dodger stadium. Be warned though, spend a little extra and get closer to the field. The crowd lower from where I was originally was more civilized, and less drunk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TrentP1
30,"Beautiful Ballpark, Good Seats Everywhere, Blah Food","We were here for World Baseball Classic, which was great fun even though weather was so-so. Not really a bad seat in the house, and a nice park overall.Food was middling and very expensive. Famous Dodger Dog isn't even beef ! Lots of stuff made in advance and sits there for a long time. Best food we had, by far, was from out in the food trucks that were there for the WBClassic, fresh and creative; not sure they are there at other times.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/350ra
50,Dodger Stadium is Best,"Of the 20 or so MLB stadiums I've been to, this is my favorite. It's not the most modern... or classic. But there's no better place to watch a ballgame on a sunny day! Go early for BP and autographs. Check out the history in the middle deck areas. (Explore!) Chavez Ravine, with palm trees and the expansive city views the other way, are even better when listening to ""I Love LA"" after the game.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tenacity40
10,Parking at Dodger stadium,"Went to semi finals and final of World Baseball Classic. Cost of parking was more than the cost of my tickets. $25 for general parking. If you wanted to park less than a mile away, you paid$60. Then there you had to walk and climb around stadium. They would not allow folks to use the one working elevator from lower levels. After the final game, we couldn't find our car in the darkened and poorly marked lot. The attendants were not helpful. Don't blame them as they did not design the parking service or pocket the ill gotten gains. These folk will never get another dime from me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GDL1948

We were able to go into press booth, down into clubhouse and see all the various gold glove, MVP, CY Young, rookie of year and World Series awards. Also into old visitors clubhouse where all the historic greats once prepared for games. Down in to home clubhouse and walk behind home plate. Very cool even if you are not a baseball fan.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/troyh480
50,loved it,we're not sports fans but loved this stadium and the two very special dodgers games we saw whilst visiting. we had food there and enjoyed it although possibly a little over priced. learnt a lot about baseball and saw the two top teams battling it out. the second time we were there was for Vin Scully retirement and an increadably special evening. when we left we were converted and would return in a heartbeat.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jemimapuddleduck_10
40,Los Angeles Dodger Fan!,"A absolutely fun time with family and friends to cheer on your team, eat a Dodger Dog, and sing, ""Take me out to the ball game""! I suggest looking at the calendar of events to attend something of interest. A variety of ""Nights"" such as Filipino, healthcare, Bring your dog, etc. I also suggest wearing comfortable clothing and shoes. The parking situation may not be the best, so be prepared to walk, up hill in some areas! There are lots of food areas, shopping, and photo ops around the stadium. You can make a reservation to take a tour as well. The stadium also host events other than baseball, you may be interested in as well, so check the calendar.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mariannem978
40,"If a Dodger baseball fan, this is a must","One can book a behind he scenes tour of the Stadium which our group just did. It takes about 2 hours and one sees the locker rooms, goes on the field though not the playing part. One sees all the memorabilia and tributes, honors and uniforms and hears about their story. if you are a fan, this is clearly a 5. I am not but still found it interesting and, of course, knew the names of all the Dodger greats, Koufax, Drysdale, Reese, Hodges, lasorda et al",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/180carlj
50,A lifelong dream fulfilled!,"My wife once told me how she could see Dodger Stadium from where she lived in Koreatown as a little girl, but she never had a chance to watch them play. So we are blessed with the opportunity where she'll finally get to see her hometown team play, ironically against the team of the city we left the day before (San Francisco)! Parking was a bit of a nightmare, and traffic was horrendous. But once we made it through the gates, it was a breeze to grab some grub and take our seats just behind first base. My wife was absolutely thrilled and it was a treat for me as well because 2 of the most iconic stadiums ever built were old Yankee Stadium and this relic from the 60's! To top it off, the Dodgers pulled off the win!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CKGTribe
40,Dodger Stadium,"We went as a group of friends from work. Had a wonderful time. There is something about that stadium that bring chills down your back. I can't say anyone aspect is better than the next, it's that combination of the Los Angeles skyline off in the distance, the cotton candy sunset over the stadium, the smell of the grass and the happy Dodger fans filling the seats. The beer and food is slightly over priced for the quality. I would recommend bringing your own sub sandwich and chips. Yes, the Dodger Dogs are legendary, but they aren't the same as the used to be. Don't forget that you are going to be outside. Hats, sunglasses, sunscreen and comfortable shoes. If you are attending a night game a small blanket would be nice to keep your legs warm. It does get cold when the sun goes down.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cthymrtn
50,Terrific Baseball stadium,"I lived in LA years ago and I would always buy tickets when my Cardinals were in town. I had a soft spot for the Dodgers since I lived in the city but not when STL came to town. I would say it's my second favorite baseball park next to Busch stadium and the old Yankee stadium. If you're in LA and it's baseball season you would be a fool to miss Chavez Ravine. The weather is always nice in LA unlike most U.S. cities during baseball season and it's one of the cleanest, state of the art ballparks in the country.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DetourRoatan

Still the greatest game in America. Dodger fan or not, Vin Scully will be missed - the best.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BadBlake
50,Iconic dreamland,"I've been going to Dodger stadium since I was a kid! It's truly one of the most beautiful baseball parks in the country, and one of the 3 oldest! So it's also a great site to visit for historic reasons.Besides going there for regular season games - where tickets can range from $12 - $200! - you can also visit in the off-season to check out ""top of the park"", the gift store at the top deck near home plate side, and the Stadium tour which is really fun! You get to visit various levels, a little museum, and areas one normally can't visit.For those off-season things, there is no charge for parking and you can just drive on in and park as close as you want to the entrance.On game days, well, there isn't a better park out there (in this Dodger fan's opinion). I was there last year during the ever-exciting post-season and the energy in this stadium is truly electric. It's got a very open, old-school vibe, with tons of food options (not just the classic dodger dog anymore) along with blue margaritas, beer and sweets, of course!The outfield Pavillions get the rowdiest, and are great for large groups. The right field (if I remember correctly) is in the $30 per ticket range and is all you can eat (how many dodger dogs and nachos can you eat?). The left field one is just normal pricing, usually a bit cheaper than other areas.Resevre and Top Deck levels (if you can handle heights, because, damn, that Top Deck gives me vertigo!) are great options for cheap tickets with still a great view of the park. Esp. try Reserve on the baselines to the foulpole lines... sometimes you can score great seats for $20 or so, depending on the game!Loge and Field level are my favorite, of course, and you can also score great seats along the baselines and foul pole lines if you search around. You still get a great vantage point and feel really close, but you aren't spending $80+ to be closer to home plate. *PLUS* a few years ago they recently installed these standing tables all along top row of the seats in each section. So even if you're seated along the foul pole line in Loge, for example, you can grab a beer, saunter over to home plate area and stand at one of those tables for a new perspective for an inning or two!Definitely plan time for parking and walking in, if you go on a game day, and check the dodgers website to get $10 parking! Otherwise it's $18 or $20 or something crazy like that, if you just head in.Also bring a sweater at night because it can get surprisingly chilly at times. Lots of fun giveaways, too, where you get free swag. on those nights, prices might be higher and/or definitely more crowded, so plan ahead for that.Go Dodgers!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/726jamiel
40,Great Venue,"Take me out to the ball game.......I had a great time with my kids. This is a great, family friendly environment for all",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CaribbeanFan79
40,Great ballpark. Weather definitely helps.,"This is a great place to see a baseball game. I have been here only for playoff games, one as long as 42 years ago, the other just two years back (date of visit is not accurate).My major complaints are that the sounds played between innings are far too loud and intrusive, the PA announcer is a ""homer,"" and it's impossible to get out of the parking lot once the game ends.Regarding the noise, I'd appreciate a chance to discuss what had gone on in the game or in the world. Not really possible.The PA announcer was prone to make clear what had occurred only when it was good for the home team. An example is that a batter swung, missed, but went to first base. You'd have to be a true fan to know that it had been catcher's interference, but the announcer didn't bother to tell the crowd. Pathetic, really. As Jack Webb would have said, ""Just the facts, ma'am,"" but all of the facts, please.As for traffic on leaving, since I was there for playoff games, the crowd was bigger, and no doubt more of them stayed beyond the 6th inning, when many Angelenos start to depart. For them it's about being there at some point, not sticking around to see who wins.If you are a baseball fan and end up in LA for some reason during the season, try to catch a game. You will likely remember it fondly, even if your team loses.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dbeharry

40,Bucket list Item Crossed Off,"o For years I would hear Vince Scully call a game and talk about the beauty of this stadium and not being there prevented me from seeing its true beauty. First, make sure you pay for parking in advance. It definitely makes life easier. The stadium is kind of unique as it is very “hilly”….you’ll notice this as you walk from your car to the stadium. Once inside the stadium, I highly suggest walking around the back of the bleachers. It’s pretty cool to see the Home Run markers they have posted with the distance and the date. My favorite was seeing Willie Stargell’s name. There is also two outdoor bars you can grab some drinks, as well as Tommy Lasorda’s Italian food. It was actually pretty good. There is a large World Series ring that you can take a picture with. As for our seats, we sat ~8 rows behind home plate and it was such a great view. Overall it was a great experience and I would definitely go here again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/richj22

30,"Stadium getting a bit ""long in the tooth""","Only referring to the stadium here, I would say, in comparison to other more modern stadia across the country, Dodger stadium is showing its age. View lines are reasonable, and seats are relatively comfortable. Food and beverage service leaves much to be desired. Not great offerings, unless you are in the VIP level seating. Parking all around the stadium is convenient, but it is costly. Entrance and exit are encumbered by traffic flow and tend to be slow.

She was of a shorter stature but had a loud passionate voice. Not one minute on the tour was dull with her. She was informative and even made being crammed in the elevator funny. On the tour we got to see the Vin Scully Press box, lots and lots of memorabilia and got to go on the field and dugouts.Overall, Dodgers Stadium is worth checking out.

50,five stars all the way,"While it is seen unloyal to like more then two teams, the dodgers have grown on me and I've been to many of their games. You have to have a dodger dog or you haven't had the Dodger stadium experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zudasworld
50,Great Old School Ball Field,"Attended a game from the Dodgers/Cubs playoff series. Great old school ball field with lots of history. Great environment for a family outing. Only drawback, traffic after the game from the parking lot is crazy. Plan on getting there either early or late, and leaving the same.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BobC1510
20,Not a home run...,"When my daughter bailed on a Mets game at CiiField, I returned the tickets to StubHub and took the credit for three tickets to Dodger Stadium this past July. Truly, I thought I was in a Dodger cap convention as everyone seemed to be wearing the same blue LA cap, probably bought at that ""Everything Five Bucks"" store on Hollywood Boulevard. Having my son and daughter by my side on the first base side was cool, but when she asked for a bottle of water, I was floored when it cost twelve bucks!!!! (I guess they're still paying off Mike Piazza's contract.) Overall, the stadium was like any other, except I missed my exit to Mission Hills seven times.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/frankvespe
50,Now one of the oldest parks and still GREAT!!,Try a Dodgerdog and have a great time in the Socal weather. This is a must see for sports fans when in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/theohiopeifers
30,Have a Dodger Dog,Tickets are always available right before the game and its worth it to sit on the lower level. Plenty of delicious food and drink choices.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rlaw24
50,Stadium Tour Review,"I am not a Dodgers fan and have never been to this stadium before. Since the Dodgers aren't playing my team (NYY) this season, I didn't really have any incentive to go to a game at this stadium and deal with the nightmare traffic that comes with it.My husband and I grew up on the east coast, but have been trying to visit the west coast stadiums. So far, we have gone on the tour at this stadium, the Arizona Diamondbacks and San Diego Padres. This tour was by far the best! I've also been to games at Yankees Stadium (old and new), Fenway, Toronto, SF Giants, and Oakland.Our guide was very informative and made the tour quite fun, I didn't catch his name, but he was a friendly gentleman from the mid-west.This was my favorite tour, because I feel like this stadium has a lot of character. The SD and AZ stadiums seemed very sterile and those teams don't have much of a history in comparison to the Dodgers. The cool thing about this team is the long history going back to NYC.I really liked seeing this stadium, it had a retro feel to it and looks like it would be a fun no-frills spot to catch a game. There is so much to see and learn about here!I wanted to add one more detail about parking, when you buy the tour tickets online, it gives you an option to pay for parking. However, the parking was free (which I knew from reading Yelp reviews), so I am glad I didn't pay for it in advance. I just wanted to clarify this, I would hate for anybody to pay for parking when they didn't need too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NYCaliKara
30,Not what I expected.,This stadium was not what I expected it to be. I am from Chicago so I was looking forward to visiting a old baseball park but it was nothing like home. I have been to 17 major league baseball parks and never have I had to wait as long as I did for a hot dog. Everything was extremely over priced and the bathrooms were dirty. Love the dodgers just not the ball park.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jocelynhernandez32
40,"Getting a little worn at the edges, but still a great place for baseball","It's hard to believe that this is now the third oldest ball park in the Majors. It's got great sight lines, solid if expensive concessions, and if you're close enough to home plate, it's fun to do a little star watching. All in all, a nice venue, even if it's a bit hard to drive to.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tarmonster1
40,Day at Dodger stadium with the family,"I took the whole family of ten to the NLDS game against Washington. Lucky to get a game in at dodger stadium while in LA, our timing was perfect. What an iconic venue this is and I was glad to share it with my family. Dodgers lost the game but what the heck, a great day and experience in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gregtracey
30,Cubs win !,"Ok ballpark. Metro and bus took us right to stadium. You have to walk to a specific gate corresponds with your ticket in order to get in. ""WORST"" hotdog ever. Don't even try it. Overall playoff ticket was $100 with decent seats. Cubs won !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SteveB476
40,Loved The Ballpark,Been going to Dodger Stadium for almost 40+ years. What a great place to catch a game and see parts of LA. Definitely worth the experience. Go get yourself a Dodge Dog!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TexasEyedoc2020
50,Best Baseball place in the west coast,I'm a giants and A's fan long story to tell. Will skip for the sake of the review. I was visiting all the MLB stadiums in So-cal and dodger stadium took me back to when baseball awesome during the 60's. And knowing some of the greats had played in this stadium make even much better. Food was great would love to catch another game here someday.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/288miguelb
50,"Take me out to the Ballgame, and DON""T MISS the Stadium Tour!","The Stadium Tour offered by Dodgers Stadium in my opinion was EXCELLENT! Do not miss this tour if you enjoy Baseball in any shape or fashion. It is about 90 minutes of pure baseball History presented in a superb fashion. From being on the playing field, to seeing the luxury suites, press box, as well as the years of awards thruout the stadium, you will enjoy, as well as get a wealth of knowledge about the Dodgers and of course the stadium! Overall Rating ~ Excellent",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/larilu
30,Boring,Unless you are particulary interested in this sport there is little joy in seeing this stadium. It is very similar to any other. We watched a game too and I could barely wait for it to be over.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/juliesH1095VY
50,First Class,"Dodgers Stadium tour was one of our favorite memories from our week long southern CA trip. Stadium offered a great view of LA and is located off the beaten path. Our tour guides were wonderful, particularly in accommodating our handicapped Mom who needed a wheelchair to get around the tour. Dodgers provided her a wheelchair and were genuinely happy to help. The Dodgers great history was well explained, and we were able to see almost all areas of the stadium, including the dugout. Team store employees were also very nice and helpful. We also did the Petco tour in San Diego, of the two, Dodgers was so much better!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MJDunn44
50,Take the stadium tour!!,You do not have to be a Dodger fan to appreciate this stadium and its history or surroundings. The tour is fantastic. You even go down on the field and into the dugouts! Highly recommend. Great tour guide and lots to see. Of course if you can go see a game that's even better,
50,Peanuts and Crackerjacks,"A must go when you're in the baseball season. Seating is wonderful. The games Are terrific. Fun to take photos. The 7th inning stretch, and viewers waves so much fun. Great entertainment even if you're not a Dodger fan.",
50,Awesome Stadium,"I grew up going to Dodger games and I will say there is nothing like sitting in that ball park in sunny Los Angeles watching Dodger Baseball. They recently renovated a few of the levels, and have updated a lot of the food and beverage options. Craft beer and more variety of food available. WIFI and a new giant screen. The location is super close to DTLA so you can uber after the game to grab drinks or food downtown, which I would recommend because the only CON to the stadium is the parking situation. It can take you up to an hour to get out if it's a sell out game. Definitely uber or take the Dodger bus from Union Station- they get their own lane and you get to skip the traffic. They do Fireworks on Fridays after every game, and you can try and rush down to the grass to watch it!",
30,Great day at the park!,"It is one of the oldest remaining parks, so you are not attending for the architecture! Compared to other parks, the security is so so. Blankets and jacket were never checked or scanned at the mag. The park should be making a greater effort! I did do their survey after attending and noted that. There were numerous choices for food that were affordable, but the beer prices were a shock!We parked in lot 13, which was only $5 with an advanced purchase on the Dodgers site. We had a longer walk than most other lots, but missed all the traffic getting in and out of the park, a good bonus! The walk was actually enjoyable and the experience of seeing the park as we walked in was memorable.",
40,It's time for Dodger Baseball,"Went to all three Cub/Dodger playoff baseball games. First night running late I got a beer an turkey burger. It wasn't bad. I usually try an eat before the game an get a beer an nuts at the game. First night great for Dodger fans. They won, everyone happy. 2nd game, Cubs won. Dodger fans start leaving in the 7th inning. What's up with that. 3rd game, Dodgers getting beat. Cub fans are happy of course. Then the thug/gang mentality comes out. I don't like that. It's a game people. Dodger fans flipping off Cub fans, throwing beer an yelling 4 letter expletives. 30 people escorted out just my section. Love going to the games but the fans need to improve. Not all of them but some of them make it a not such great experience.",
40,Had to do it,"Got tickets to a dodgers vs SF game. The stadium is impressive and the ticket gets you a free shuttle to the stadium and back which is a bonus. The game itself was alright, baseball is a funny sport and as a first timer I did not really understand or enjoy the actual game. Its quite expensive for food and drink inside the stadium as well but thats to be expected at any sports ground these days.All in all a worthwhile trip with which we got some good photos.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/403antm
40,Fun Evening!!,"This was our first visit to Dodger Stadium and our eighth MLB park. The stadium is surrounded by paid parking and is rather difficult to get out of! The place is over fifty years old and it shows it's age when compared to the others we have visited. Also the concessions are more limited than the other stadiums. However, it did not detract from a fun evening and a great experience. The views were excellent and the fans in our section very friendly. There was an Hispanic festival in one of the parking lots before the game which added alot of fun to the day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JD19666
10,Stadium club food is garbage,We celebrated my birthday last Augusr by going to a Dodger Cubs game but the Dodger stadium club was not the treat we thought it would be . The 40 dollar buffet was easily the worst buffet I have ever had. The hot food was cold ...the salads wore soggy and everything was cheap except the price. I expected an inflated price but the food was easily the cheapest and worst prepared. The staff was also uncaring.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Johnkoller
30,National League Championship Game 5,"Seating in Loge area was fine. Good sight lines. Food and drinks are ridiculously expensive. Dodger fans very exuberant. They cheered for walks and singles like they were home runs. Parking was ok, because we came early and left early. The Cubs won, so we had a great time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulcB6604SH
30,Cubs win,"We were lucky enough to get tickets to game 4 of the NLCS game. We are Cubs fan and went in Cubs gear, it was a ruthless crowd. A lot of cursing, and comments. But mostly everyone was decent. The Cubs won, so that was good! This is an older ballpark, expect a long long walk to wherever you parked. And pricey to park too. We did utilize the courtesy cart though and that saved a ton of walking. The drivers were very nice and informative. Go Cubs!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shannonm26
50,Cubs Dogers2016 NLCS,my girlfriend and I had a great time sitting in the left field bleachers watching game 3 in LA.The LA fans sure are passionate and sure are alot of fun. I would defiantly go back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NphxVacationGuy
10,Quite possible the worst ballpark experience in MLB,"I've been to about a dozen MLB ballparks and had always wanted to go to Dodger Stadium because I had heard such great things. Driving in and walking up to the ballpark, it is aesthetically pleasing and gives you that feeling of excitement walking into an old ballpark for the first time and knowing how much history it holds. However, that's about where the positives end.We arrived about 60 minutes before game time and had outfield seats. At this time, they had a mariachi band playing behind home plate, blasting through the concert size speakers in centerfield. Whoever manages the sound system there should be forced to sit in the outfield and listen to it for 30 minutes a day as punishment because it is brutal. I like mariachi music as much as the next guy, but they had it blasting so loud that I literally had to yell into my wife's ear to have a conversation. I had completely lost my voice before the game had even started.Then of course, you've got the Dodger fans, who are way more interested in heckling than in watching the actual game. The heckling isn't limited to opposing players, but also opposing fans, and even Dodger players. I think in any ballpark, you can always expect a few of those type of home fans so you come to expect it as a traveling fan, but in Dodger Stadium, the hecklers seem to be the vast majority. It was amazing how many times someone would stand-up and try to yell at an opposing fan two or three sections away even. It seemed to be in-discriminatory as well, since I saw them even yelling aggressively at women who were minding their own business and trying to enjoy the game. Of course, the worst was when I saw a family of opposing fans with a small boy trying to take a selfie, and the Dodgers fan behind them flipped them the bird in a photo-bomb. The Dodgers fan seemed so proud of himself too, as if that was his greatest achievement in life (maybe it was).I also believe this is the only ballpark I've been to where they have armed policeman walking the aisles, but in this case that is a good thing. I would not expect that at any other ballpark, but here it's a necessity, and it helps to maintain some sense of security for home and away fans alike. This is probably the one thing (other than Vin Scully) that Dodger Stadium has going for it. I would like to end by sending out thanks to the officers who are doing their job in trying to keep a safe environment for paying guests.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jdp6575
40,Stadium with character,"We bought tickets in the Pavilion area to see Dodgers square the Divisional playoffs. What an experience. The Pavilion is an all you can eat area, so it was hot dogs and nachos. Softdrinks and water were free as well.Go see a baseball game if you have not been.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/982benc
50,Great Park,Love the ballpark. Wonderful location and scenic all around. Recommend going early to park without dealing with excessive traffic.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cmchugh1965
20,Playoff game,"Hate to rate dodger stadium this low because the ballpark itself is very nice. For one of the older stadiums around baseball it has great character, great views and until recently vin scully. But the staff there is lacking and baseball etiquette of not crowding the aisles during an at bat seems to be lost. Just a reminder fans when an at bat is going on other people are trying to watch as well. You are not the only one there. Contacted security about this twice and got told they were monitoring the situation and nothing changed. They did exactly what they said they monitored people standing in the aisles during at bat after at bat but did nothing about it. Very disappointed",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/634scottj
50,First Dodger's Visit and Loved It,Closest baseball stadium to Australia so we think we've adopted the team. Loved it. Parking was amazingly easy and 1min walk from entry gate. Chose seating wisely. And don't forget to try the so-American nacho melt in upturned helmet. Cholesterol USA> Drove 25 mins to LAX and home to AUS..,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Desmovalve
50,First Dodger game,Had a great time at our first Dodger game. Got tickets in bleacher seats and must say felt like best atmosphere in this section. Good food and beverage available.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ivaz94
50,Love the stadium because I love the Dodgers,I've been going to Dodger Stadium since I was a preteen. I've seen Sandy Koufax & Don Drysdale in action there. The stadium is clean. Bathrooms are clean. They have a large variety of food concessions. Gotta have a Dodger Dog !,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cher4nier
50,Great Ballpark!,My son and I went on the stadium tour and I would highly recommend this tour. You get to go in places you wouldn't normally see and sit in the dugout. The tour guide was very knowledgeable. This tour lead up to the playoff game we attended. We sat in left field section 301 - great section to sit in. Go Dodgers!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AandMColes

50,Best in the West,"I have been to Dodger games countless times and it's always enjoyable. I was fortunate enough to attend Vin Scully appreciation night and took in one of the best sports-related ceremonies in the history of Los Angeles. The stadium itself is a gem. Yes, it's very old but the history and natural beauty of it is what makes it special. This is one of the best baseball stadiums in the MLB. Go Blue!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/javieraM9241VA
50,Vin Scully appreciation night.,Not Dodgers fan but respect the franchise and team. Got to witness a cool evening and a Dodgers victory 5-2 over the Rockies. Good luck Vin Scully.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StevenR239

30,Beautiful views,"Large, huge, enormous parking lots. Old school feel. Beautiful views of Los Angeles!!!!!! Have to say I would come here again. Funny thing is, they were playing the Rockies when I was visiting and this is the only stadium (out of 18 I've been to) that I didn't see not even one visiting team fan. Wierd.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheodensQueen

50,Iconic Stadium,We loved the action of Dodger Stadium and thoroughly enjoyed our recent Dodger game which the Dodgers won! Go Dodgers!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cherylg641
40,Take the Stadium Tour!,"After taking a tour of Fenway Park while in Boston, husband and I were ashamed to realize that, though we are both Southern California natives and lifelong Dodgers fans who have attended multiple games there over the years, we had never taken the tour of Dodger Stadium. So we decided to remedy that and booked a tour.What a great experience! As good as the tour of Fenway Park, but for us, it was even better due to our emotional attachment to the Dodgers. It was great hearing about the history of the Dodgers (both Brooklyn and LA) and Dodger Stadium and to see behind the scenes. We got to visit the pressbox, Vin Scully's broadcast booth (I'm glad we were there while he was still the Voice of the Dodgers), the Dodgers Dugout, the trophy room (filled with World Series trophies, Gold Gloves and many other awards), a private luxury box, and much more.It was a really fun experience and worthwhile for visitors to the LA area, even you aren't particularly a Dodgers fan, since Dodger Stadium is the 3rd oldest baseball stadium in MLB after Fenway Park (April 1912) and Wrigley Field (April 1914). Granted, Dodger Stadium (April 1962) is much younger than those two, but still older (and with more history) than most ballparks in the US.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luckylyn5
50,What an experience!,"Visiting USA we decided we had to see a baseball game. Booked to see the Dodgers months ago in England. Everyone we met was so helpful, as we had no idea where to go, where our seating was etc., we saw the Dodgers play Colorado Rockies, on the day they had a ceremony to honour Vin Scully, so we were extra lucky. After the game which the Dodgers won there was a firework display. We ate hot dogs and nachos, had a great time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gwenjohns2016
40,Be warned about the food!,"Drove from Vegas for Vin Scully appreciation night. So worth it! The previous time was when Mariano Rivera final season, when the Yankees came to town! It's been 3 years.The night belongs to Vin Scully with lots of tribute and pre-game celebration honoring the great! There was standing ovation and thunderous applause! The night ended the night with a display of fireworks!Some things never change...in terms of this ballpark food! Horrible hotdogs! $8 for a piece of xyz! The first one was okay but when we got our second dog at the bottom of the 4th inning, the dog was placed in the steamer and the bread got so soggy, it disintegrated. I wish I had taken a photo of how horrible it look and the bread wasn't edible. We simply threw the bread out! What a bad experience...food wise",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Momma808

50,Play Ball,"Came here on July 4th 2016 with my family to watch the game as well as the fireworks. Both were a great treat. I found the food a little pricey, but what isn't in California. There were a lot of food stands circling the seat area and the lines all moved quite quickly. If you go in the summer, remember to bring sun screen and wear a hat,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/darylmarx
50,Cardinal Dodgers Game,Leave very early for the stadium due to heavy traffic. Uber works great as the Uber lot is close to the gate. We entered when gates opened and walked the perimeter of the beautiful ballpark. Upper deck seats behind home plate provide excellent view . Tommy Lasorda stand in center field served good food. Fans and ushers were friendly to a visiting fan wearing Cardinal Red. So take me out to the ballgame.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JB0426
30,Vin Scully weekend,"It was a great outing. Sold out crowd great atmosphere great game. Dodgers won 14 to 1. The stadium is great don't think it matters where you sit , you have a good view of the game. The down side is the seats are not that wide so if you have a big person next to you it gets tight. Leg room is not that great either.Food and drinks are expensive. So bring your own water and snacks to safe some money.Now as it was sold out parking was a nightmare in and out. Be ready to sit in traffic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/505elliew
50,Brilliant,"It's been 23 years since my first and last visit to Dodger Stadium, it was my first MLB ballpark and since then I have visited over half of the others.I couldn't be happier to re visit Dodger Stadium, I drove myself which I wish I had given myself more time due to traffic, but the aspect and views of the stadium were outstanding.The game we attended was a sell out so the crowds were intense, we sat in the upper deck and walking up the stairs outside helped me realize that the stadium is actually built into the hill, not just dropped on top!The concourses for such an old stadium still work, it's not new Yankee Stadium, but it's better than old Yankee and way better than The Trop or even Kauffman Stadium which its closest to aesthetically.The Dodgers lost, but that was the only bad thing about my visit, getting out of the parking lot wasn't as bad as getting in, in fact it was a breeze, and I believe if you're driving to a sporting event anywhere with 56,000 attendees, you have to expect some level of traffic congestion.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CRAIGMc873
50,Unaffliated with either team and had a ball!,"I was treated to an evening at the ballpark and had an amazing time. We sat 10 rows behind homeplate and since I was neutral I could just sit back and take it all in. Great baseball venue, my Dodgerdog looked a little sketchy, but was delicious.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Harrydawgsdad
50,One of the Very Best,"Great stadiums are hard to define but Dodger Stadium is easily one of the very best in baseball.Easy parking, fast access off 110 freeway, awesome view, excellent stadium club, great fans, Vin Scully, and friendly design with tons of concessions, shops, wide walkways and washrooms.After last night's game against the SF Giants, we were able to walk away from behind the plate in the main stand to our preferred parking and driving onto 110 freeway all in less than 20 minutes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jacklD5839DS
40,"Great Team, Great Crowd, Great Stadium, Uber Craziness!","Its a great day for a Dodger's Game!Great team, great players; Vin Scully is retiring. Fantastic atmosphere - great baseball crowd. A lot of activities going on for the crowd.NOT UBER FRIENDLY. This was my first Uber experience - I didn't want to get lost or caught in traffic so I took Uber from my downtown hotel. No problems, $8.35 approx. Drop-off is at a fixed spot at the Sunset Entrance (12) - a good mile walk from where I had to go to my entrance. A little difficult to find my way back after the game at night. When I got there - there was total chaos - a 1000+ people were also there using Uber. A very weak ATT signal. I couldn't get uber, a massive network jam-up! Also a massive Uber traffic jam coming up the hill trying to get into a location to pick people up. Just crazy. One poor Uber service tech to handle all the issues. Not good. I finally had the service tech order a car for me after waiting 30 minutes or so. It took the car another 20 minutes or so to get up the hill. Slow going. $10.50 or so on the way back but I was happy as hell to get out of there. A lot of people in the same boat. Painful experience - I drove the next night. No worries.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jccgtown
50,WOW!!! What a great a great ball park!!!,"Visited for a Giants vs. Dodger game. WOW!!! This is what a ball park should be. With 56,000 screaming fans, the atmosphere was electric. There are lots of concessions and beer stands. You have to try the famous Dodger Dogs.The location in Chavez Ravine is stunning with great views. Give LA traffic the park is hard to drive to for a 7:10 pm game.This is a must see ball park for any baseball fan.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mcangemi
40,Great place to watch a ball game,"I recently visited for 2 games against their biggest rival, the SF Giants. I found it very easy to get into the stadium grounds, park and enter the stadium. There are plenty of options for food and drink, but as it is for most ballparks, be prepared to be separated from your hard earned money to pay for food and drinks. I look forward to returning to this landmark.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AZ_Foodi
10,Getting to Dodger Stadium is Impossible!,"Well, we have now vowed never to attend a Dodgers game again. Why? LA traffic and incompetent traffic cops. It should not take two hours to drive 21 miles. And to make it worse, the traffic cops just made the traffic flow issues even worse. So we can't watch the games on cable and now can't attend the games. Way to go!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hlkjx4
50,Dodger Blue,"If you're from out of town, or especially from out of the country, I always recommend a local sports team. And of course, baseball is a bit of American, which is fun to share.

50,"Good place to watch a game, eat, and hang with your friends","The stadium is well kept, the crowd is fun and the food is good for stadium food. Their Micheladas were decent, their garlic fries are the best and the soft serve is not only served in a cute souvenir cup but it's delicious.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/polek2014
50,Go Dodgers!,"This is now one of the oldest ballparks in the MLB. It doesn't look old. Complete with new food stalls and wider aisles, this ballpark is a pleasure to walk through. Great backdrop to the mountains and palm trees. Not to mention that it is the home of VIN SCULLY! You can't beat it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/291ronniec
40,first time at dodger stadium,"an icon like dodger stadium was a pleasure to visit, for it was near our hotel, easy to traverse, and had a great uber pick up spot. the dodger dogs were okay, and that's all we had, so hard to gauge the rest of the food.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/garett2014

40,"If you are a sports fan, outdoors fan, getting excited about the game Dodger Stadium is the place for you","A great place to enjoy people, a great baseball game, the outdoors, whether they win or not Dodger stadium provides you with all the entertainment you want to have, the concession stands are pricy but it does not seem to discourage the fans from buying.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Srnegotiator10
50,Enjoyed this park,"Was pleasantly surprised at the condition of this ballpark, as it opened in 1962! It was clean, staff were friendly and welcoming! Very fun experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/woffer
40,An old park with a lot of history,"We caught a Friday night game and loved the experience. This park is smaller in comparison to a lot of the newer ball parks, but the experience was still well worth the price of the tickets.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mpgrandpa
40,Couple games for out of towners...,"Very nice stadium, took 13 year old and he enjoyed the stadium tour in the afternoon. LOTS of walking for this senior grandma. the field level seats were great for a special treat. Would NOT ever do the Stadium Club buffet, the access with the more expensive seats not worth the bother ---overpriced for ordinary food.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/331vickib
50,Can't wait for the next game!!!,"We're from the UK, me and my fiancé weren't sure what to expect but had always wanted to go and WOW what an experience!If you're not sure you just need to do it - we got tickets through stub hub and like anything you get what you pay for. We were pretty close to the field.You can take drink and food to the seats which I thought was ace (I'm used to football in the UK and that's not allowed!), there's always food people walking round the seats too.You'll need a taxi to get there and traffic is NUTS. If you're looking to buy an LA cap go to a 'Lids' store it's cheaper than the stadium!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cmfhewett
50,come to this stadium of you want to learn about LA,"the Dodgers and Dodgers stadium have been of the LA scene since the late 1950s. So if you want to get a feel for what the locals do then you can do no better than catching a baseball game at Dodgers Stadium. ticket prices range from very expensive to very affordable depending on you. I was just there yesterday (9.6.16). we had a great time. you'll want to purchase a Dodger dog, some peanuts and maybe a beer to make your visit complete. the Dodgers store is notoriously expensive. I mean $42. for a baseball hat? come on!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Svaldez
20,Beautiful but old,"The playing field and setting are beautiful, but the concourse is old and dated, lately lined with more beer and liquor stands than anything else. The food is mediocre to downright bad, the lines are interminable(expect to wait an entire inning) due to antiquated inefficiencies, and the prices are exorbitant though on par with other stadiums, I'm told. The sheer volume of alcohol vending and sales produces many drunken boors and fights (they won't even sell it in the bleachers), a scar on the O'Malley's family Dodger brand that their greedy successors have trashed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Marcimayerson
30,Go Dodgers!!!,"The parking was not to bad, we showed up 1 1/2 hour early. It got pretty crude though. The seats were good but coming up and down those stairs killed my calves for 3 days. The 24oz can of beer was 14.00, the Draft was 11.50, Big lines, lots of people. Everything was about 10, we spent to much we each had 3 beers,peanuts and nachos, could not really enjoy it because the people on our isle were going up and down the stairs with all there little ones. I'd rather watch the game on Television so I can drink all I want and eat whatever I want and not have to deal with the crowds of people...and go to the little girls room in peace...lol",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JnC1542
50,My Favorite Classic Ballpark,"During my trip to San Diego I decided to spend a day in LA and see a Dodgers game and I was not disappointed. I had purchased tickets in advance to see the Dodgers play their arch rivals the San Francisco Giants. I had also booked the stadium tour prior to the game, which I highly recommend. I arrived at the stadium in plenty time for the tour and signed in then waited on their club level. While waiting I became enthralled with the stadium itself and took some great pictures including of batting practice. The tour took us throughout this majestic ballpark including to where the World Series and other Trophies are located and we got to watch batting practice from behind home plate. After the tour I went to my seating location and took more pictures. I did enjoy a dodger dog however I've had better hot dogs in Philly, as well as in Baltimore and Yankee Stadium. As time went by I became more in love with the stadium and it was great game.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/twinskin
30,upgraded venue w bad food and drink options,"I like that the stadium got an upgrade, it shows. However, the food is still bland and barely edible. The Dodger Dog is really the only thing I can stomach. And the drinks, which are hideously overpriced, are also not good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annied260
40,Dodgers vs the Padres!,Overall a positive experience. We drove to the stadium allowed plenty of time for traffic and delays. Definitely consider taking the express lane when headed to downtown. Parking was well organized and properly staffed. General parking was $20. We walked about 5-6 mins to the gates. Super fast if you don't have a bag with you so come light.They definitely figured out how to deal w amassive number of ppl. Everything seemed quick! (Even the bathroom lines).It gets cold as soon as the sun sets so make sure to bring a jacket or sweater.The prices for alcohol was insane $13-20 dollars per serving. That's a lot if you require a few.....Police presence was also dominant which made everything tame. Great job on the city's part maintaining events/details like these.Ladies: better to wear comfy shoes. Lots of walking and stairs. Casual attire. And gets chilly after dark.Would def come again!!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LoveCaliforniaLiving
50,Great place to watch a Baseball game,Dodger stadium is on a short list of OLDER stadiums.... seats are great - still a great place to see a game... Bathrooms could use an update though....,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidpR4816AS
30,Go Dodgers?,"We have been here a few times not as Dodger fans , but classic Rock fans. Great place to see a concert. It's big enough for everyone and much better than the delapidated LA Collisieum. If you're into hot dogs and nachos, be prepared to pay too much. This stadium was built in 1957 or 58 and so was the parking lot. That's the big problem -It is a disaster to exit at the end of the show. This time, they had a lot of LAPD due to the thug element, but they don't direct traffic. It's left to the 'parking clerks' and they arrived too late to the party. It's time to make modern updates to the parking areas but the current owner won't budge. Still, it is a great place to see a loud Rock n' Roll show🤘",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/teddyb1968
50,One of the great ballparks in America. A must visit for all baseball fans.,There's nothing better than watching a game at Dodger Stadium. Dodgers vs Cubs on a Sunday afternoon. Both teams in 1st place . Great atmosphere and Dodger dogs are the best,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JMR1965

30,Plan Extra Time if Using Dodger Stadium Express,"Recently attended Cubs / Dodgers game there. Took Metrolink from Oceanside, and used the Dodger Stadium Express to get to the stadium.Trip to stadium was uneventful - took approx. 15 min. to get through a line of approx. 150 at Union Station.The return trip takes a lot more finesse. If you need to be back at Union Station at a fixed time, you need to leave before the shuttle busses get stuck in post-game gridlock.I left in the 8th inning, at 3:50, to catch the 4:40 return train from Union Station. Thought that was more than enough time. Faulty assumption!Bus arrived at 4:00. Unfortunately, dispatcher would not allow it to leave until 4:15PM. Then we were told to transfer to another bus. Thought we'd be okay, because we arrived at Union Station at 4:25PM. Unfortunately, due to construction in the Union Station bus plaza, it took the bus another 8 minutes to grind around the train station to the dropoff point. Ran to the train platform, and made it with 4 minutes to spare.They have a limited number of busses, so they have to choreograph departure schedule with game progress / traffic / etc. Unfortunately, there's currently no way to communicate when the next bus is leaving. That would help people plan the return trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/825dougs
30,No easy way to get to Dodger Stadium!,I have been to the stadium weeknights/weekdays weekend nights etc....and there just is NOT an easy way to get there. Traffic is pretty bad everywhere! I recommend using your smartphone GPS for directions. We took a shortcut that saved at least 25 mins on the drive!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bzymamacee

He was there in spirit for sure and it felt like a true family celebration of life.Everyone in that park was helpful and kind.We had a wide range of ages.The park is easy to get in and out of. A very clean stadium and wonderful fans!Really a historic site.I cant imagine abad seat in the house!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TRIPBarrett

30,Eh......,"Been to 15 stadiums, and this is near the bottom of my list...OK it is classic and has nostalgia, but you are confined in the stadium... not very fan friendly...many of the stadiums have amenities and fun things, not dodger stadium... and its also the most expensive stadium in baseball (and im from NY)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/medina4834
50,Visiting from the UK great American experience,We love sport and decided we must take kids to an all American game. Though the game wasn't the most exciting the experience was fab. We did leave before the end as the traffic was horrendous getting there and couldn't stand sitting in it again back to the hotel. Would really recommend whether you no what's going on or not just to take in the atmosphere!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/950francesr
50,Dodgers vs. Giants,Attended the Dodger vs Giants game. the stadium is very clean and nice considering its age. We sat about 20 seats from the Dodgers dugout. Enjoy seeing a game at this stadium.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KimberleySTL
50,Superb Stadium Tour,We saw all the interior spaces of the stadium and the memorabilia. Awesome for a long-time Dodger fan!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gkras
50,Great pregame tour and game,"The pregame tour of this iconic facility was great--we got to see and learn a lot. The stadium is really neat and the views of the surrounding hills (and the Hollywood sign from the right field side) were great. We were able to move and get seats out of the sun for awhile. Good food options, of course great gear. And we topped it off with a win for the Dodgers!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HeatherS363
50,Take me out to the ballgame,My favorite location in La.....my fondest memories. I have been a Dodger fan all my life. And a fan of Dodger stadium as long. A year is not complete without a visit or two. Every change they make is welcome and exciting. Love Dodger Stadium!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/538pamelas
20,I'd never bring my kids here,"It's was Dodgers vs Cubs and I literally can't believe the amount of fighting that went on. It was my first dodger game and honestly this completely and utterly ruined it. The park is nice and everything easy and fast to access ( food, stores) but the people...... Awful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Streetthiefprod
30,Seen one seen them all,"I've been to several ball parks around the country, though I will give credit to this one since it was the first ballgame I saw as a kid, but otherwise it is a little old, and the team hardly wins lol",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WineDineandPlay
40,3rd Oldest in the MLB - and still going strong!,"Chavez Ravine is a wonderful site for ballpark. The views from the seats, looking out over the outfield, are really pretty. Parking here is ample - but getting to and from the parking lot was a real bear. In fact, getting anywhere around Los Angeles is a real bear.So, my wife and I are on a quest to visit all of the MLB ballparks. This is our 29th - and we flew in from the East Coast for a southern California swing through San Diego, Anaheim and Los Angeles. (As an aside ... traffic? MAN! I don't know how California folks do it!)The ballpark is NOT showing its age. It seems management has taken great care of it and done several enhancements over the years. It is spacious (still the largest seating capacity in the MLB), the seats are comfortable, and there is a variety of food available. I'm not saying the food is great or that it's inexpensive. It's not - on either score. The Dodger Dogs are OK, though.The staff at Dodger Stadium are great. When they found out we were on a ""quest"" they wer sincerely interested and wanted to know about the other parks. They wished us well on the rest of the quest.Now, you might want to read a few other posts about how to park in the best area to be able to get out quickly after the game. We had preferred parking close to the stadium for both of the games we saw but, apparently, that's not the thing to do. We ended up giving up and just sitting in the car for at least 40 minutes before the line of cars FINALLY began to move. I suspect it would be best to park closer to the exits, facing out, and walk the longer distance to the park. Parking close to save the walk seems to be folly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sssster
50,Dodger Stadium,"Prettiest stadium in MLB. Enough said. Either go to a game or drive by and check out the view. Nothing like the view from inside the stadium on a warm summer day, with a frozen margarita!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2004elisabeth
30,Take me to the ball game,"At any sprouting event you love your team, your players but unfortunately not the food. Highly recommend bring your own sandwich, snack etc. get your parking pass online and save even more money. Plan ahead.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lisapF1459DM
50,"Iconic, one of the last BIG stadiums left","I go to a lot of Dodger games and have been to concerts here as well. Parking and timing are key. I recommend driving if you can and getting premium parking at Lot K, through downtown gate e. After a game I get home to South Orange County in less than an hour. You need to arrive at least an hour before game time and go to the end of the K lot where you see the downtown exit and park facing out. After the game you just cruise right out and can get right on the 110,101,10, or the 5.If you have no car, the shuttle bus from union station is a better option than uber or taxi. Line is pretty fast after a game, can get pretty congested for playoffs but still better than uber. Food and beer is very expensive and nothing special. Stick with Dodger Dogs or pizza. As far as seats, if you can afford it, get the baseline club seats. Comes with a private bar with restrooms and all you can eat food (upscale and dogs/peanuts) and free programs, A/C. Seats are roomy with tables, backpack hooks and seat service (free food). Otherwise do get deck 1 seats somewhere. I like to play it fast and loose and go to stubhub at the last minute for good deals. For concerts, get on the floor (outfield), sound is great.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trishL006
50,GUNS AND ROSES 18TH AUGUST 2016,"Wow loved Dodgers Stadium, im not sure how it rates compared to the other stadiums in America but for us being from Australia, it was great! Beers were crazy expensive though at $14 each, soda was about $6.50 each and nachos in helmet which was cool was $10 which is reasonable. Seating is great as every seat faced stage so no turning your head and heaps of restrooms so no waiting. Easy to get in as there is several entrances. The one thing that really made me angry though was the Dodgers express bus didn't run so we had to wait about 2 hours for a taxi after concert. So man6 people would of used bus and even paid.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ReneeNaumann
40,Baseline Club Seats for Good Eats and Seats!,"So my son is visiting from Texas and wants to catch a Dodger game. Okay, I thought we would grab a good seat and fill up on Dodger Dogs and peanuts. You don't know my son. I've mentioned before he's a big boy and loves to eat. (He's in hog-heaven with all that Texas bbq.) So, he wants to do the Baseline Club with the premium seats and the all-you-can-eat buffet restaurant. Well the on-line price from the Dodgers is a little expensive but that doesn't stop him. He goes on-line and finds tickets for $100 each. Okay, I guess we're going. First stop, the food.The restaurant that night had carved roast beef, baked chicken with (?) (looked like grits but tasted better), an assortment of salads and vegetable sides. A really nice spread. Definitely, worth the trip. And you can eat until the food runs out or at least the 8th inning. Of course, there were Dodger Dogs and you could load them up with chili, cheese and other toppings. And there were bags and bags of peanuts. There are soft drinks, coffee and ice cream. (I made myself a nice root beer float, yum!) The beer and liquor are not free and very expensive, I mean very expensive.The seats were very good. Between 3rd base and the outfielder's position and a few feet away from the field. There was no one in front of us. Beware, you need to watch the game as foul balls do come your way as they did that night. The Dodgers beat the Phillies that night and hit 4 home runs. So, it was as good game to watch.You may like me think that a $100 is a little steep to pay for a game. But, it's night with my son (priceless), a Dodger game and all you can eat. What the heck, go for it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ralphh909
30,Great time,Last night of Guns n Roses. Three stars due to unorganized uber designated area for pick up. Total chaos. Wound up walking down to Sunset and getting one there. People at the stadium that got users were stuck for half an hour waiting to exit. Crazy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ballerina501
50,Dodgers Game,"My family was vacationing at Disneyland and we spent a Sunday at a Dodgers game. My boys are playing little league baseball and even though one is a Cubs fan and one is a White Sox fan :-) they are fans of the Dodgers. Sunday's are family days at Dodger games and the kids can run the bases after the game. For Midwesterners, this was an awesome experience. The stadium is old but clean and well kept. Where else can you go to a game and see the Hollywood sign from the parking lot and palm trees from your stadium seat? There's lots of stairs to climb, so wear comfortable shoes. We had seats in the bleachers with a bit of shade (by accident but we were thankful) that we purchased the day of the game. We went early so my kids could attempt to catch a ball during batting practice(success!) The fans are loud and fun, doing the wave around the entire stadium and hitting a beach ball around. The food was great- we enjoyed the dodger dog, garlic fries, blue popcorn, and ice cream. We were warned about the traffic exiting the game, but really it was no worse than in any big city. One tip, wear blue!",
20,Parking Nightmare,"It is 30 bucks to park and if you are planning on getting out in a timely manner after a game or a concert, not in this lifetime. All I ask for 30 bucks is someone directing traffic, which was sorely lacking after the Guns N Roses concert. Bright Side: this is a beautiful venue for baseball. Seats are nice, food is tasty, and I think it would be amazing to see a game here. I will be brave and come back to see a game.",
50,Blue heaven on Earth!,"A classic, must-visit spot for both tourists and locals. Dodger Stadium retains its vintage charm and provides a one-of-a-kind experience for fans of America's pastime. Try a famous Dodger Dog or one of many other food options including gluten-free and vegetarian options. Don't miss the bobble-head display on field level.",
50,A great way of spending your evening in a super setting,"We sat high up in the stands but what a view of the surrounding Hollywood hills. It was fabulous to see the sun set across the stadium. We hadn't watched a baseball game before so didn't know what to expect, but really enjoyed it. The crowd were funny and interesting to listen too and friendly, with no issues like you get with UK football hooligans!We paid for parking in advance which saved $10, recommend doing that on the Dodgers website which was easy to use.During the game we enjoyed the 7th innings stretch, and as always the national anthem at a US game is quite a site. We didn't stay until the end for the Friday night fireworks as we had been in Universal all day as was tired, but i imagine that would've been quite the sight considering the stadiums elevated view. Parking wasn't too bad considering the amount of people in attendance although working out where our seats were was a little more complicated.We highly recommend this for a good evenings entertainment, all the family of all ages enjoyed it and for the price it's an absolute bargain.PS - the Dodgers lost and didn't hit a run all game but it was still a great night out.",
20,"Sadly, this venue should be on everyone's no travel list!","I am an avid baseball fan and travel all across the US to visit our great ballparks.Unfortunately, Dodger Stadium isn't one of them.The charm and secluded hills that it was built on are no longer secluded and therefore...getting in and even worse, getting out, are a real nightmare to visit this stadium.We got to the park at 7pm for a 7:10 start and didn't get to our seats until the bottom of the 3rd inning.The facility is old, the concessions and availability are limited and the food is horrible.The Exiting of this place is a raging nightmare!Its all cars, there are no other forms of transportation to the game so welcome to the worst case scenario getting out.Never again.",
40,Not afraid of Hites,"I went to Dodgers stadium to catch a game between LA and the Phillies. The game was thrilling; lots of hits, home runs and good pitching. The stadium is the third oldest baseball field in the MLB and is worth checking out (behind Fenway and Wrigley). You can come to the game and purchase tickets at the box office if you don't have them on hand. There are many sections to chose from and you can easily spend 400$ for tickets. I bought a ticket for 21$ for top tiered tickets and I'm glad I did, the view was awesome. There's a cool view of the mountains behind the stadium and good vibe overall. You can see the baseball game without binoculars and not miss a beat. The concessions are priced like expected. 10$ for hite beer, 13$ for domestics and 15 for craft/imports the same goes with the food. I took an uber to the game and the parking lot has a designated area for uber drivers to drop and pick fans up, lot 12 I believe. This option makes sense if you plan on drinking and also if you don't want to deal with the traffic heading home. It was Jackie Robinson retired pin night so it was nice to take home a souvenir.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rgd973
50,UK Visitors Go for The Coca Cola All You Can Eat Pavilion,"We (five adults) went here on holiday from the UK for a taste of all American culture. As rookies we were unsure what to expect, but loved the experience. Booking on the excellent LA Dodgers website from home couldn't have been easier, and we chose the Coca Cola All You Can Eat Pavilion which is under the right hand screen.Baseball purists probably rate these as the seats with a poorer view, but for us it was perfect. The inclusive food and drink meant we could go for the full hot dogs, nachos, popcorn, peanuts & soft drink experience without worrying about the extra cost.The crowd around us was great, really friendly and hilarious. Families can sit here without worry. Great day out. We all agreed we made a great choice, and had a super day. Go Dodgers!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PhilipandSheena
40,Great Venue and History - Some Drawbacks,"For 33 years, 5 of my friends and I have visited every MLB ballpark. It was only fitting that one of the oldest parks, Dodger Stadium, was the last one.First off, the ballpark has a sense of nostalgia. If you love baseball you will love Dodger Stadium. The concession area is wide and not cramped. Being an older park, you still get some modern conveniences, such as TV monitors. It has great views of the landscape and for an park, it simply feels and wreaks nothing but baseball. I would also note that if you are attending a day game, be sure to get a seat that provides shade.A couple of drawbacks are not enough restrooms (though I wouldn't say it was totally inadequate). Also, the lack of variety at the concessions and LOOOOOOONG lines for beers. The area around the stadium lack any type of pre-gaming opportunity.Traffic is also a bit of challenge. The Uber lot is packed and getting your ride, although manageable, is chaotic and takes time. I do feel that once you are out of the parking lot and onto the streets, traffic moves well.Even with the drawbacks, any baseball fan would love Dodger Stadium and it should be on your bucket list.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O8197VCpaulm
30,Average Fan Experience,"Have been to 22 Major League Baseball Stadiums prior to Dodger Stadium and the fan experience at Dodger Stadium was definitely one of the not so better ones. They force you to go in certain gates, even though all gates lead to the different parts of the stadium. Customer Service staff is not very friendly or helpful in helping you locate your seat, or anything else for that matter. They need to send staff to Minute Maid or Busch Stadiums to learn customer service.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/STEVEND265
40,Take me out to the ball game (and make it at Dodger Stadium),"For Australian visitors (used to sitting through 5 day cricket matches!), this was a must-do cultural experience. We had a great time. Relaxed, friendly crowd. We drove with LA friends, and parking was both reasonably priced and very close. For non-car visitors, the shuttles would be the way to go.I DID have a dodger dog; even though I am not that much of a hotdog fan, it seemed like the culturally appropriate thing to do!Can't beat the 7th inning stretch though for the true ball game experience.If you're in LA during baseball season, I recommend an afternoon/evening getting into the spirit. Oh, the Dodgers lost.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Arncliffegirl
40,3rd oldest Major League Ballpark,"The weather was blazing hot. The sun was relentless, and the play on the field suffered. But, the ushers couldn't have been greater - allowing people with sun-baked seats to move. Great stadium staff all around. The visiting Pirates shamed the home team, and I'm a Pennsylvanian, so I'm okay with that. Nice experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VKurtB
50,Great day out,"First time at the stadium I loved the game, the atmosphere and had a great night even though dodgers lost. Shame the store prices and food prices are so high.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sailormoo
40,"For day games, sit on the shady side","We came in via train to Union Station and took the free Dodgers shuttle to the game. The shuttle has a dedicated lane and seems to me to be best way to get to the stadium instead of fighting LA traffic and paying parking fees. The stadium is old which is part of its charm. The fans were great and we struck up great conversations with them although I was clearly cheering for the opposing team. Food at the stadium was very expensive - perhaps more than other MLB stadiums I have been in. We went to a 1:00 game but sat in the Loge level in the higher rows (row P) and were shaded the entire game. It made a big difference in how much we enjoyed the game. If you are going to a day game, it pays to do your homework and find some shaded seats (rows M to Z). The third base side is much more shaded during the afternoon than the first base side. Great park, great fans, great day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lowlander46
40,"Hot, but Culturally Adequate","The stadium was very hot in July, but we had suite passes to escape the heat. However, the buffet and table seating was not included in the $100 passes. The view was very cool - palm trees stood behind the outfield. Parking wasn't too bad, but we had to walk a ways!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vacation638145
50,Best day ever!,"We are travelling through America and saw our first baseball game here, and we had so much fun!! Easy to walk from where we were staying in downtown l.a too, about a hours walk and really scenic! You can't take open food/drink and also strict on bag sizes so check the rules before taking a big bag!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Brightonrocks2012
50,One of our highlights,"This was one of the plans we made prior to our trip. We are Red Sox fans since we live in the Northeast. The Red Sox were playing the Dodgers and it was not to be missed. The night we were there they honored David Ortiz ""Big Papi"" which made it even that more special. If you love baseball, you need to see a game here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/debbieg1230
40,Very Nice Ball Park,"By far the classiest ball park I've ever been to. I was surprised at the uphill walk to the stadium. I was also surprised at all the seasoned food choices. If you like, flavorful food this is the park for you. For example, garlic fries & spicy chicken. If you don't love the heat, go to an evening game. We roasted at a noon game!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mnovak
30,Out of towners on our first visit,"We're Orioles fans, and Camden Yards is hard to beat as stadiums go, so am confessing that bias at the start.I love the ""vintage"" feel of Dodger Stadium and the amazing setting. I am however, spoiled to a true ""downtown"" stadium with ample routes in and choice of many parking lots, so I'd advise that other out-of-towners leave PLENTY of time to get to the stadium as the bottleneck of fans trying to navigate a single street to the parking lots was intense, and parking is crazy expensive. You can save a few bucks by buying parking ahead of time online.Otherwise, I'm happy at any day at a ballpark.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/43reds
50,Had a ball on Star Wars night!,"Went to Star Wars themed game between Dodgers and Diamondbacks...lots of people dress up, free Tshirt and awesome atmosphere. We were in the back row of the left field and the people were so much fun, it's so interactive and the vibe is just amazing....magical taste of American sport for those of us from overseas. Friday night fireworks were best I've seen in my life albeit very short at the end.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suzr1977
50,It's Time For Dodger Baseball,"I love me some Dodger Baseball. Been to tons and tons of games here since I was a kid and still love going. Some say the stadium is more expensive than most. Probably true. It's L.A. They've upgraded the bars a little recently, which is nice. (Micheladas!).Find the specialty food stands if you want more than just a Dodger Dog. Extreme Loaded Dogs (Reserve 4, Loge 133, Field 48) for some crazy hot dogs. Field level has a few exclusive concession stands. Right field Pavilion has Italian options at Tommy Lasorda’s Trattoria. The all you can eat section in the outfield is great if you want to eat unlimited amounts of hot dogs, nachos, peanuts and soda for a decent price. Also have their own, much shorter lines for beer. Pay for parking online in advance and it's half the price ($10.00 online. $20.00 at the park)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/linzerb709
30,Not what I expected,Good stadium and not a bad game but there was something missing. I understand the stadium is old but the team or ownership doesn't make up for it elsewhere. Everything was expensive and the concessions just too crowded. Overall it was a nice game and afternoon but I feel like Dodgers need a new home that will truly reflect what the team has to offer.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/402omarn
50,Last night treat,"We booked tickets for our last night of our holiday before we travelled, also pre booked parking, this is a much reduced rate than buying on the night. Being from England this to us was a truly American experience and we were fascinated by it. It is very friendly even with fans mixed together. The whole evening appeared to be about the many different types of food available ( quite expensive). We loved the fact that every 2 minute changeover was filled with entertainment. Also very impressed that with over 52000 people at the game we got out of the car park at the end of the game with no wait! Brilliant end to the holiday - thank you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/timothytrood
40,"Good Game, Fast admittance, Good Audio, Video, and Easy out","I had not been to Dodger Stadium for two years. On this last game, I was surprised because the entry was easy, the display and music and such were good, the Dodgers won, the fans were well behaved, the food was good, and we had an easy time getting out. If you go, carpool to save costs on parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LAtoEverywhere
40,Fun watching when they win!,I've been there many times with friends and family. The food is expensive and so is the beer. Montejo sucks! I've been to club as well and it is great! Josh and Will are great bar tenders.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SteveinLACa
30,Another stadium off our list.,"Our goal is to hit all 30 MLB parks and Dodger was number 22. The history around Dodger Stadium is incredible but for watching baseball there is very average. Atmosphere is pretty boring and a Dodger dog is just a hot dog, nothing special.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RoyalsFans
50,All You Can Eat!,"Sat in the All You Can Eat Pavilion that includes soda, water, nachos and cheese and Dodger Dogs. If you go for a day game sit in the top 6 rows where you will have shade. Also buy your parking on line and you will save $10. Good value.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A2474HVjeffm
50,Everyday is a good day for baseball in LA,"I'm a local boy born & raised in the city of LA .. So what can I say about this place it's a baseball monument .. 2nd oldest stadium with a capacity of 56,000 it's a must visit if your looking for American activities on your visit ... Snacks are pricy & beer as well so eat well before heading over if your not looking to spend much .. Go Dodgers !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LaBellaVita323
40,"Great Stadium, Great Baseball; Lousy, Overpriced Food, Difficult to Exit","This will be my first review where I admit I may be a bit overly critical. But, here's the deal: the Dodgers have the ability to excel in every way and they're not doing it.The core product is a winner. The Dodgers are terrific. The stadium is superb. The fans are top notch (except those awful ones from a few years ago, but every town has some bad apples). So, why not improve on the Dodger Dogs? Why charge so much for beverages? It is not necessary to cut costs at the expense of fans. In addition, why not put more attendants in the lots after the games to direct traffic out more effectively. Again, for a few bucks the overall experience could be improved.Lastly, for the suggestion box: take a cue from the Washington Nationals, which offer a hoaky race of mascot presidents to add excitement to the fourth inning break. For LA, a race among mascot celebrities would spice things a little bit. Keep improving Dodgers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JackD919
10,Disappointing visit,"We were all excited to attend our first baseball game but came away totally disappointed. We attended a Friday night Boston v Dodgers. Nobody appeared to actually watch the game,constant disturbance from people up and down getting food and drink throughout the game,talking between themselves. If you are used to watching English football you will be amazed at the lack of interest from people around you claiming to be fans. American fans around us said it's normal it's just a night out for them! It's novelty value wouldn't recommend",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlendaR315
40,First Baseball Experience,"Took the kids whilst on holiday in California , The build up to the game was much better than the game itself and we enjoyed the hot dogs and Nachos . Overall a fun day out but still prefer soccer or rugby",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Idrissnog
50,Dodgers host the Red Sox,Fabulous time! We enjoyed being in the Stadium Club with our group of friends! We had great field level seats although the game was early 4:00 and we were in the sun! Expensive snacks 2 Dodger Dogs and 1 bottle of water was $20.50,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/debbier901
40,Match,We saw dodgers against Phillis. It was very good in the beginning but it kind of died. Than dodgers one it was a nice experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nanapiesie
20,Not a lot of food and drinks to chose...,"Been to diff. Stadium but this place doesn't have much to chose... Hotdog, popcorn... Drinks r too expensive... Traffic r really bad... Don't bring ur car... Take the taxi or uber, more convenient.no near bar outside the stadium... Transportation needed... Don't try to walk, it's too far",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fsdevera

50,Visit from UK,"We booked tickets (via stub hub) for the day after we arrived from London.Family knew very little about Baseball but we really enjoyed the day. Great atmosphere and fantastic stadium.It was hot and fully exposed where we sat (Loge level, 142) & food and drink was a complete rip off ($15 for a can of beer) but we still had fun and Dodgers scored 14!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thethistles_1
50,Great,"If you like baseball, you have to go. It's one of the Mecquas of baseball. Lots of fans, great ambiance. Food is quite expensive though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cassdy
50,Dodger Stadium Tour,"Took the Dodger Stadium tour on July 25 at 10 a.m. You meet at the upper deck behind home plate. Park at Lot P and go to the upper deck. Stadium is built into a hill so you don't realize you are at the top deck. The guide was very informative about the history of the Dodgers. We got a chance to go into the Dugout, Opponents clubhouse and see the Vin Skully press box and a suite. I've been on a few ballpark tours- Wrigley and Fenway so I had to see the third oldest ballpark in MLB. See some cool memorabilia, World Series Trophies, silver slugger awards, ROY awards and Cy Young awards. Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brenth455
50,"Fun park, passionate fans!","I've been to Dodger Stadium several times - with groups, solo, with a single other person - and every time it's been great. Fans are excited to cheer for the team and are overall really fun to be around. The food is good, there are SO many different hot dogs. There are a lot of drink carts all around, too.Pro-tip: if you pay for parking beforehand (online) it's half the price",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kateoS8832HT
50,BB fans must see,"This is stadium #17! Enjoyed visiting this stadium with so much histoty. Really enjoyed the atmosphere. Love the way it is arranged. You can walk all around the stadium and still see the field. It looks as though every seat is a good seat. Beer is most expensive I have ever paid including super dome in New Orleans. Lol! The ""Famous Dodger Dog"" really should be called the ""Infamous Dodger Dog.!"" LOL! But that didn't dampen my experience at all. Dodgers won! Great day at the ball park!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/987shaynep
40,Take the bus!,"The Dodger bus from Union Station was an absolute find. It's free, it gets you there and back quickly. Plus we met a Dodger fan, named Angie, who helped us to the bus, told us what stop to get off (the top). And we got a bobblehead...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Suzer56
30,On mission,Our family is slowly visiting every baseball stadium in the country. This was #23. Bring ALOT of cash! It has THE most expensive beers and the food is not that good. Stadium itself is nice.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michellecF5211DU
30,"Great fan support, hard to get to, nice view behind home plate",Dodger stadium is one of the older MLB stadiums (50+ years old). The radio announcers for the visiting team sat in what looked to be a wooden room behind us. On the loge level there didn't seem to be much selection of drinks and foods. People were still streaming into the stadium at 4th inning I guess due to the traffic. They had a great Star Wars promotion along with fireworks that night. A nice visit but I'm not sure I'll go back again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/318hollyd
50,Amazing,"This was our first visit to a baseball stadium and what an amazing atmosphere. From the time we arrived venue staff couldn't of helped more, sorting out our ticket issue which we caused by not printing a copy(Hint). Some times your elecronic copy on your phone wont work. Inside the venue there are designated staff to help you. They even gave us a certificate for being a first timer. As with any big venue food and drinks are on the high side.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/U5593ERdaves
50,Heaven on earth,"Best place ever...great date place or just to hang out with friends. Fan or not, the food and the atmosphere I'd great.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ea_gallegos
40,Nice experience,"Took about 100 employees to a game there, great atmosphere and the food was good. Nice full bar, seats were very good as well. Parking easy and convenient, but at $20 a little steep. Staff friendly, well trained. Has Uber puck up area, nice idea!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bennetpetersen
40,A must see,"Dodger Stadium is a must see for baseball fans. It's an older park and there's a lot of history here. We came to a Dodgers game and it was a lot of fun, even if we were rooting for the visiting team (our home town guys). The views are gorgeous, with the Hollywood hills in the background. Seating is a little odd, at a strange angle, but we were in the cheap seats up top. Very reasonable ticket prices.TIP: getting in and out of the stadium area is a challenge, along with parking. And, they always seem to have the highway exits closed…? We took an Uber and had an Uber pick us back up after the game. They have a designated Uber lot (Lot 12) and it made getting there a lot more enjoyable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LoriP920
40,"Very nice tour, a lot of history!","Unfortunately there were no games during the time I visited, but I did the tour and was not disappointed. There were only a few people in the group which was nice. The tour includes all the spots you want to visit. Locker room, field, stands, press box, trophy room etc. The Dodgers have a rich history in baseball, it was very nice to hear all about it first hand.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ben_1985_02
50,Great day at a ball game,Having never experienced a Major League Baseball game in person we loved the atmosphere and the set up of the stadium. We caught the Dodgers express shuttle from Union St which made commuting easy! The only negative is that the drinks and food was quite pricey,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clarenmillie
40,"Nice stadium, worth the visit","One stop along our vacation was Dodgers stadium. Nice vintage stadium but a little disappointed in the cleanliness of the place. Seats were quite dirty.Sat in loge section seats and would highly recommend, especially at the base lines. Great spot for a foul ball. Food is expensive but that's what you have at any mlb stadium. Took the Dodgers express from union station. Very easy to do and although we didn't drive I am sure much less of a hassle than driving.Overall a good time and worth the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mpmba
40,Great Venue,Great venue to watch baseball but an extremely frustrating venue to get to and leave by car. The car park has more traffic jams than a LA freeway. As for the atmosphere it was fantastic. Would definitely recommend a visit to Dodger Stadium and see the Dodgers in action.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A8503VKtomc
50,Fourth of July Fireworks!,"We attended the July 4th game. The Dodgers won and the fireworks were fantastic. My only complaint is that the food and drink in the ballpark was pricey. Nonetheless, the pizza tasted great and the Dodger's won! The eagles and fireworks after the game were spectacular!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MommaGiiGii
40,Take me out to the ballpark,"This is such a nostalgic place. If you are a baseball fan this is a must see place. It isn't like the new parks. It is definitely dated but with character. If I could change anything, it would be the menu selection. The best place to dine is in left field. Good selection there but limited in rest of park. The scenery is awesome and there really isn't a bad seat. This place was cool.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Texincolorado
30,"It is a nice stadium , but it is way over priced.","The stadium is nice, when the weather is good. The Friday fireworks is worth it , if the game doesn't go to long and they cancel it. The beers are about 12-15 bucks each , nachos were 12 dollars. I get it it is a ball park and yeah I still spent 200 on drinks and eats, but the cost of these things are getting a little too crazy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ddubdub11
30,"Cricket, but a bit more boring!","Let's start with confessions....1. Don't know the rules to baseball2. It's not roundersIt's hard to appreciate a game when you don't know the rules, but we tried, and it was a bit boring to be honest. This was probably because both teams were poor. One home run.I suppose I would be happy to go to Man Utd and see a boring 1-0 win against Sunderland, but that isn't really the point.On positives, good atmosphere, lots to see, lots going on..On negative, although entrance quite inexpensive, once inside nothing is! Caps €40! Beer €13!Well I've been, done it, got the cap, and will never complain about Geoffrey Boycott and maiden overs ever again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulmU5997JI
40,Fun Baseball Experience,Went to a game while on holiday in LA. Was a fun experience with a great atmosphere. The drinks and food are very expensive and had to have my passport as not a is resident. Overall a great time. If you are traveling here use uber as they have great uber pick up and drop off zones.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/862joshd
50,THIRD OLDEST BALL PARK IN THE NATION,"Although Dodger Stadium is the third oldest baseball park in the country (behind Fenway in Boston and Wrigley Field in Chicago), the ball park and stands are as new and inviting as many of the current ball yards. A great place to catch a baseball game. Decent food, many giveaways, and the feeling of history permeate the ball park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/arnoldg65

40,"#20 of 30 MLB Park, Great Stadium, truly SOCAL!","What a fantastic stadium, this was #20 of 30 MLB Parks we've visited and we certainly weren't disappointed. We came in at street level and the first view was down into the field and was spectacular! We used the $5 parking and it was a bit of a walk, uphill at times, but it was a pleasant walk with no hassle exiting. Many food choices, try the Hot Chicken Blue Cheese Fries, totally awesome. Even though this is one of the oldest ball parks, the SOCAL feel shines through and this is a great place to enjoy a baseball game!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gibsoninpa
40,Great tour,"We did the tour of the stadium and it was very cool. The tour guide was super knowledgeable and enthusiastic. We got to visit the press box, a suite and walk on the field. Very enjoyable for baseball fans.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/433michellel
40,"Lots of history, classic baseball, but...","Tickets are pretty pricey as baseball prices go. And the parking...so awful...always! However, if you're a baseball fan, it's still worth going. The Dodgers have a long and interesting history, it's a beautiful park with a great view, and all of the seats are good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R3022NRlisag
30,Fun but parking a nightmare,"My family and I had a great time at a Dodgers game. the drive to the game was horrible but the Dodgers can't control the crazy drivers and bumper to bumper traffic. However, there must be something that could help with the parking. There were some attendants there to help but they really should run a shuttle to make it a bit easier for fans to get to the gate. We did splurge on Dodger dogs to eat but they were a bit expensive. Vacation time is family time but we can only afford vacations by being very frugal. We bought cheap seats in the nosebleed section but even being so high up we had a great time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Grayson907
40,Dodgers vs. Padres,"Visited Dodger stadium and saw the Dodger vs. Padres game. Got last minute seats and they were not that expensive. Great stadium however like most stadiums, food and drink were expensive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LoveHawaii13
50,Walk Off at Dodger Stadium,"A fun night with family and friends. Beautiful stadium considering it is MLB third oldest. Easy to get to as we drove from downtown LA. Good seats 2nd level just off first base about $55.00 each. Food selection is the usual ball park fare, but expected a little bit more from LA. From a personnel standpoint, I've been to many games and ball parks, but this was my first walk off HR win...of course for the Dodgers. Friendly ticket staff, security, and venders. If you're in town I highly recommend it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Planetisourown
50,Dodger Stadium never ceases to amaze me!,"I grew up a Dodger fan and the field hasn’t looked as good as it does now. The Blue Crew must have the best field operators in the business as this place is old but never shows its age. The game was exciting and we sat in the all you can eat section and it and boy did I ever get my money’s worth lol! It was bring your dog to the park night and that was very cool. It was also movie night ad after the game was over, we were allowed to go down to the field and watch Top Gun. It was a night to remember and the Dodgers won! Had they lost, the night would have still been memorable as we were in Dodger Stadium but the win did make it even more special.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G3743BSdaniela

50,"Pure Baseball Stadium, with Scenery and Great Weather","If you like to 'watch Baseball' then it doesn't get better than this (West of Chicago). No tailgating, no pre-'bars' or 'Dodger-ville' and no frills other than the natural beauty of the stadium, it's surroundings, the Dodger Dogs, and the near perfect weather throughout the Season. Whether a Dodgers fan or not, Go for the game and the experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HansAbroad
50,Good fun,Had a great time. Ok to catch a taxi there but not so easy back. They do have a free shuttle to get you to union station than you can get a taxi. We had great seats.

50,One of the best tours!,"7 of us took the ""Clubhouse Tour"" one Sunday afternoon and it was informative, fun, and an overall great way to spend an afternoon. The guide (Marc) was super knowledgeable and it was great to see the 'inner workings' of the stadium, including the Dugout, Clubhouse (locker room), weight room, all the trophies and awards, the press box, the luxury suites, etc.. and to hear and understand some of Dodger history (Did you know they were named the ""Trolley Dodgers"" way back when?). There is no age limit - from little kids to my 84 yr old uncle enjoyed it. There some walking; nothing too bad, but you definitely need to be able to maneuver steps and walking. Overall this tour was well worth the $50/person price. Would highly recommend to anyone coming in to town, or even some 'jaded Angelenos'. An A+ experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marthamF6863VH

50,Biased but it's Blue Heaven,"As a fan, I'm biased. There are way nicer stadiums in the MLB but this one is my heaven.I love the Loge level. It's just the right amount of height and it has lots of the things I want. The back rows offer some shade during the day games. There is a bar right when you enter through right field and it's got great Micheladas. There is a craft beer stand also near this entrance. You can get helmet nachos, fries or popcorn.The Field level is obviously great. The seats closest to the back rows will also usually be shaded during day games. The more expensive Field level tickets also offer in seat food service.Top Deck tends to make me dizzy. The Reseve level can be decent, just not too high.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/misspomona
30,Typical modern stadium,"Your experience will depend on what you're willing to pay for. Our seats, in the shade were very reasonably priced. But nothing else was. Parking and every refreshment was downright expensive. As another reviewer has said, you ARE allowed to bring in a sealed bottle of water or a soft drink, which helps. But, the ballpark experience simply can't be duplicated anywhere else. so, every once in a while you pay for the hot dog and beer that are part of it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sandlun
50,Great buzz,"1st visit to baseball and we loved every minute, it was like going into Disney, well organised, car parks huge!The buzz in the stadium was electric and loved the wee snippets between rounds, kept us entertained.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Turner022
50,Always fun,"Great thing about Dodger Stadium is each visitor can bring in a factory-sealed plastic bottle of water, soda, iced tea, etc. No alcohol, no glass or cans. You can also being any any food you want, as long as your bag isn't larger than a backpack or small soft side cooler (see rules on Dodgers website for full info).Water fountains allow you to refill your water bottle.Parking discounts if you prepay online.Food choices are extensive if you want ballpark food, but prices are big league, too.Been coming to games since 1998. Always a fun time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Saranger
50,First time back in 20 years,"I grew up in the LA area in a baseball family with baseball fan friends. The first time I went to the stadium was to see the Angels play the Senators with Claude Osteen on the mound for Washington. My first Dodger game was the next year in 1965 against the Phillies with Bunning facing Koufax. Lots of memories. The stadium is different in some respects: advertising everywhere; loud sound system, and high definition scoreboards. This is standard now and does not detract from a venue that is designed for baseball and still architecturally beautiful. The terraced entrances and well-landscaped grounds are in a class of their own. The sunset was gorgeous with the clear-cut outline of the San Gabriel mountains slowly fading away. No other sight like it in MLB.Downside: upper deck seats are over priced and the ""handling"" fee for my online purchase was offensive. Food was expensive (especially the beers) but my Dodger Dog was still good.Upside: shuttle buses offer relief from traffic and parking fees. I took shuttle from Union Station. Talked with people who take the light rail to Dodger games! A nice change.Overall: a great place to watch baseball. (It is the second oldest park in the NL after Wrigley). I highly recommend that you go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pds525
50,Fantastic evening out!,"If you fancy something a bit different then go and watch some baseball! I had never been before so was trying to figure out the rules but thoroughly enjoyed the whole night, we had a Dodgers dog and I even bought teddy of a dodger dog! We bought some souvenir Dodgers hats and our seats were fantastic views even though we only paid $20 each so I would definitely recommend!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kay8991
50,HISTORY!,"The feeling you have when you walk in is amazing! First off, I had NO idea that the stadium was located on top of a hill! Fixated perfectly in a bowl shape, in a perfect crater. We visited while no game was going on. Must come back and catch a game. But still, what a cool place. The gift shop is always open and full of goodies.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/timv0960
40,Fun when in large groups,"Having lived in LA for a while, I've been to Dodgers Stadium on many occasions. I'm not a baseball fan at all, but have had a great time there socializing with family & friends, and eating all of the scrumptious stadium food.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelRobs
40,Family's first MLB park during cross country trip,Not as good and nostalgic as Fenway but it was fun. Had to walk all the way to behind home plate for a ice coffee but you have to move around in a coarse of a ball game anyway. My kids first MLB game and they were excited to get Three bobble heads each. $16 beers weren't worth it. But great ballpark nonetheless.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tfpslappy
40,Tight cozy stadium,I like stadiums that keep the playing open but the structure tight. It's not massive but you feel like it is on the inside. Food choices aren't great but you're in LA so you have tons of options otherwise.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/564daniely
30,"Great view, awful concessions, parking nightmare","I'm a life long Dodger fan I've been going to Dodger Stadium since it opened and have been a season ticket holder for over 35 years. Many great memories. It is a great view with the hills behing the outfield. Recent remodels of the concourse on the field level have been done well and I like the new stand up counters where you can eat and drink. The unfortunate thing is that the food is downright awful (and SUPER expensive). I've traveled to over 20 other ballparks and simply don't understand why Dodger Stadium has the worst food of any of them. Parking, or more specifically, traffic trying to get in or out, has always been a problem. I admire other big city stadiums that have public transportation that drop you off right near the stadium.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C7473PKmichaelg
40,Beautiful park but be prepared for security lines,"What a beautiful, clean park with plenty of parking. The food choices are numerous -- with the carne asada nachos being a favorite. The chicken tacos also were outstanding. Just be prepared to wait a long time in security lines -- at least 30+ minutes. And somewhat disorganized, allowing large piles of people to wait without any knowledge of what was happening.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DonnaD741
40,Take me out to the ball game!,"Had a great time with my family. A good Sunday afternoon at the game. Getting in and out was a breeze, very organized. Many people directing traffic, courteous and friendly service. Stadium is well maintained. Field conditions looked great. Many concession stands and Dodger apparel found at the stadium. If you go, hot dogs are a must! They are amazing. Check it out while in town.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/npena1020
50,Must see ball park,We saw a great game and forth of July fireworks show and neither disappointed. Wonderful old school field.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/turissd
30,Not a lot to like,"I am a baseball fan visiting 27 of the current 30 MLB ballparks and Dodger stadium, with all the history and resources available to it, was a extreme disappointment. We visited two nights and our seats the first night were upper deck. We entered the ballpark on the lowest level and were directed up a never ending set of stairs to enter the upper deck only from the outside. Once there, we couldn't enter the remainder of the park to explore. The following night our seats were on the lower level and we had access to the lower parts of the stadium which were OK. The food was average in quality and expensive. The field was OK and the information gotten from the jumbo trons was average at best. This is 25th out of the 27 ballparks I have seen and there is no excuse for this to happen.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/srobby
50,Go to batting practice.,First visit to Dodger did not disappoint. Took an $8 uber from downtown LA. Got there 2 hours early for BP. Got to walk the whole stadium and take photos. Grab a Mexican beer and an over-rated Dodger dog and enjoy the sites. Top 5 MLB park for sure.Fans can be a little rough on the visitors. Wear blue.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/baltlocal22
50,Took my 9 year old daughter to see her favoritwe team the DODGERS!!!,"Game was sooooo awesome. The Dodgers beat the Rockies 6-1. My daughter Lola plays softball for the Dodgers in our hometown of Gallup, NM and she was so excited to see her favorite player Corey Seager. She was yelling and singing along. The stadium is such a beautiful stadium. The Carne Asada Nachos in a plastic Dodger hat was amazing. We also got free bobble head MVPs. My daughter says it was the best night she ever had. I agree, I had much fun as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rippyw
50,Game night,Watched against Orioles the baseball game and I liked it. Stadium is located near the city and facilities are five star starting from parking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HannuV
40,Always a good time at a venerable ball park!,"I've been visiting Dodger Stadium for over 40 years and while it isn't the newest ball park, the incremental improvements have definitely raised the overall profile.Sure, it would be nice if Dodger Dogs were a little less expensive, but the Loaded Dog place has some tasty additions costs on par with any other MLB stadium.Seats are generally very comfortable and there's nothing like relaxing on a summer's evening watching your team play. On a perfect day, which happens more often than it should, instead of a marine layer, the sky stays clear well into night and as the sun sets, the last reflections of orange play of the hills in the background.Pro tip: Once you arrive and enter the gate, peruse the flyer/booklet that lists where all the various different types of food are. You might have to go up a level or two to find what you want.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dpcla74
30,Unless you are going to a game there is no reason to be here.,"Dodger Stadium is fine if you are there for a game. If not, there is no good reason at all for you to be there. There is not one thing special about it. It is a stadium and not a very pretty one.It is located off Sunset Blvd. sort of near Downtown Los Angeles. There is nothing in the area that you want to see, not an eatery, nothing.The parking is expensive, if it is even open.When going for a game, you will pay at least 20$ to park. Their hot dogs are terrible, there is no good food, the seats are old and really, do you want to see a game on vacation--if so, go, otherwise there are 100 better things to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elizabethlascheid
30,"Huge Stadium, but in the middle of nowhere...","We traveled to the stadium with friends from LA to see a game. They are from abroad, but live in LA and have never seen a professional baseball team before. The game was okay, but there weren't many people there to help you find seats. We are used to Busch Stadium, which is newer and full of retired people who work at the stadium seasonally and who are really friendly and helpful. We were really looking forward to going to a bar or restaurant within walking distance or even a short cab ride, but there are none. Be prepared to stop drinking after the 7th for a while. This stadium is basically surrounded by a huge parking lot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Traveljunky04
50,Dodger's Game on July 4th - - excellent,We came into town for a long weekend getaway. Decided to go to a Dodger's game on July 4th since they were going to have fireworks. I would totally do that again and recommend it.They honored service men and women. Very nicely done and first 4th of July where I didn't get mosquito bites.HIGH RECOMMEND prepaying for parking prior to going to the game.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rglaskin
30,Has aged classily,This stadium certainly isn't the best around the MLB but it isn't the worst either. For the 3rd oldest stadium in the country it's aging quite well. There are some things that seem to be in disrepair but not many. The concessions aren't great but then again it's a baseball stadium. My only gripe is you can't walk around other parts of the stadium to explore and see like in most stadiums. They actually have people guarding the stairs. Stop in one of the many bars in Echo Park for a few drinks before the game. Beers are $15 inside. Beef Dodger Dogs are 7.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Blubusdrvr
40,Our Team Lost but We Still Had Fun!,"One of the requests from our grandson on his birthday trip was a ball game. The week we were there the Dodgers were playing the Nationals (grandson's favorite). Plus, it was Dusty Baker Bobblehead Night!So an evening game but we were there in time to watch batting practice. We had seats right on the First Base side and 3 seats on the aisle so grandson loved running down the steps trying to catch any balls. I loved that the snack bar and Ladies Restroom were steps behind us!It wasn't hard to leave in the evening because we hit the gift shop and most of the cars were gone by the time we left!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/edie0208
30,Lags behind many other ballparks,"15 years ago Dodger Stadium would have been above average, but times have really changed.The seating is pretty old and worn out in the lower section (dirty yellow) while the access into the park is confusing compared to newer more open stadiums. Lots of ads on the video boards and decks with less information shown than other parks.Pros are the concessions (expensive but better than other parks I have attended) and the staff which was friendly and helpful.Note that general admission parking is now $20 and preferred is $50. A complete ripoff. Lighting in the outer reaches of the parking lot isn't great at night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dave9956
50,Take me out to the ball game,Never to told to give baseball a try. Old American past time. Dodger Stadium is one of the oldest stadium. They provide great getaways and exciting time for the family. Try it you just might catch a fly ball.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lisapF1459DM
50,GO BLUE!,"We were hosted for the LA/Rockies game on July 2. I hardly ever go to Dodger Stadium but we had a ball. The park is first rate, heavy security is everywhere. These days I appreciate that. Bathrooms are very clean and well attended. Food is delicious but a bit expensive. If you buy a beer, share it with someone and then get another cuz it will get too warm fast.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/405hollys
50,A great place to see a ballgame....,"It is hard to believe that this ballpark has been around since the 1960's. The park is very well maintained and the Dodgers have done a fantastic job updating the park with modern day comforts while still maintaining the original charm. Security is very good and there are a lot of Dodgers personnel to make sure that you enjoy your day at the ball park. The food selections are OK and are a bit on the pricey side. Ticket prices are reasonable considering that you are in LA. All in all, it is one of the best ball parks to watch a baseball game. We took the free Dodgers Shuttle from Union Station and that alleviated any issues with parking and access to the ballpark.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zebra11
40,Could use some upgrades,"We enjoyed a fun afternoon at Dodger Stadium. The stadium itself is getting dated, and could use some refurbishments.A couple of tips:- Buy your parking in advance, you save half for general admission parking versus paying at the gate.- The loge level, rows K and up were shaded during the day game, which was nice.- The hot dogs are fantastic, especially the slightly larger one (not the Dodger dog, the other one)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/msmccorm
30,Average food at above average cost,"50+ season ticket holders. Regular counter food selection is limited unless one leaves our seats in the MVP loge above home plate and walks half way around the stadium to behind right field and down 2 levels. Plain Hot dogs (sometimes warm) , hot dog and bun/onion/relish/mustard/ketchup $6.00 and $7.00. More expensive Stadium Club upstairs at the end of right field , far removed from the center of action requires special ticket. field level ""club"" bistros at hefty annual have more variety. Beers from $11.00 - $13.00+ more expensive than other field I have attended. It's still our baseball club but the management, even with the improvements since the prior carpetbagger was driven out, can do better to improve selection and quality to match the cost.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mediumbodine
40,How to visit on the cheap,"You're most likely here for a dodger baseball game consider catching the bus shuttle from union station access here is via the la metro light rail system it will save on the $20 parking. For cheaper tickets use the sites like stubhub or seatgeek and if you have a smartphone you can use that to get into the ballpark. For those who want to bring food never had a problem I resorted to this becuz the food variety in the upper level is mostly dodger hotdogs which look more like a licorice stick. However, for those with young kids they have a mini playground in the upper level",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hoben01
40,Great older ballpark,"This was my first visit to Dodger Stadium and I was pleasantly surprised. It is an older stadium and I expected it not to measure up to newer parks but I was wrong. Parking was easy compared to others I have visited and despite LA horror stories I've heard, it was easy to get into and exit. One interesting thing was the aisles are really narrow but the sections are small too. You may have to dodge people going to and from seats but you don't have to climb over a lot of people when you leave your row. I think I like that better than what I'm used to. Food was a little pricey but the Dodger dog is a must have.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NaturalizedTexan
50,Very nice do recommend,"It is a must to attend a Dodgers game it is so much fun, went with Family and it was the best. The food is very good must have a hot dog when you go to the game. Will definitely be back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/667jaquelinez
50,Dodgers game ...great fun,"First time to a Dodgers game ... Easy transport , free shuttle from Union station...starting 5.30 for 7pm game .Staff very helpful .easy to find seats and get food .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SydneyLolita
40,One of the greatest sports venues,"Dodger Stadium is full of history! Great place to watch a game, or an AC/DC concert!!! Is very spacious and the views are spectacular. There is something about this place that is truly unique when it comes to watching a baseball game. It's very different from the stadium down the 5 freeway. Fan atmosphere is different, most fans are long time fans and die hard fans at that. They stood behind a fan boycott when the Mc Courts were in charge and came back in droves when the new management took over. Dodger Stadium is perhaps the only sports facility that has terraced entrances and not one level entrance for the entire stadium. So if you have the top deck seats, get ready for a walk!!! When the Dodgers are not in town, go and visit the top of the park gift shop where you can walk out to the top deck and just relax and look over the field. Awesome place for a game, awesome place to visit during the off season. ONLY CON...PARKING! Parking here is TERRIBLE!! It goes back to the Terraced entrances. Each level has a parking level designated for each seating level. Aside from that, a massive General Parking lot. Getting into the stadium is a bit of a hassle, true Dodger fans know the ins and outs of the Stadium but if you ask any one of those fans, no one fan has the same way in or out. Because of it's location, there are several side streets and back ways into the stadium aside from the obvious and main entrance off of Sunset.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gcfam79
50,A gem that every true baseball fan must visit,"Dodger Stadium is absolutely worth a visit for every single baseball fan. The stadium is old (now the third oldest in MLB) but doesn't feel dated and expertly matches the old with the new. The food options are very nice and well priced (although Dodger Dogs aren't quite the amazing thing everyone seems to make them out to be), the staff are amazing and the tickets are well priced. Its also easy to get here without a car and the staff does a good job of managing and providing drop off and pickup points for cabs and Ubers/Lyfts after the game.If you're in LA during MLB season and have a chance to see a game here, you should do so.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/skywaker9
50,Great Fun!,"First time at a LA Dodgers game, what a great experience! Definitely recommend! Parking easy, staff every helpful! Great atmosphere!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JackieF522
30,Not the best ballpark I've been to,"I have a bucket list goal to visit all 30 major league ballparks. This was ballpark #13. And one of my least favorites. There is really nothing special about it. There are large bobble head statues you can take pictures with but that's really about it. The food sucks. I didn't want a dodger dog or garlic fries that seemed to be everywhere. I wanted a burger. Because of the low attendance on the night we went, there was 1 place to get a burger. After we finally found it, I was disappointed to say the least. There were 2 options. One cost $16 (are you kidding me??) and had a bunch of crap on it. The other was a turkey burger for $8. Even that came with some kind of pineapple relish and mayo dressing. When I asked for a plain turkey burger with cheese only, the vendor made it sound like I was asking to move the earth. I also ordered fries and was given a cup of over done ones that had been sitting for awhile. I thought about complaining but thought I already ""pushed my luck"" with the plain turkey burger. Seats were good, we sat in the upper deck behind home plate. The parking lot is huge and they do a horrible job of marking sections. Others places I have been have some sort of marker every row or 2. Not this. If you have never been, make sure you take some sort of picture where your car is in relation to the stadium",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/denisek857
50,A Fun-time At the Ballpark,"The park is a throwback to the 60's; cute. Easy in and not too hard exiting. One note: if you don't come in your own car, use Uber. Taxi's are very expensive and the neighborhood doesn't look safe to walk around. We Ubered ourselves all over LA. We had great tickets, and the seats are padded. Yes padded!! Makes for a more comfortable game. Sorry to say, though, that the much ballyhooed ""Dodger Dog"" was just ok and the ""Brooklyn Dodger dog"" was awful. We are from Chicago, and it is hard to find a hot dog better than a Chicago hot dog. However the soft serve in the plastic helmet was delicious and the Mexican food looked fantastico! If we go back again, I'm going with the Mexican food. The garlic fries were so-so. You have to salt them with a shaker that is by the cashier. As expected, the food and the beer were quite expensive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sunster-Chicago
40,Standard Stadium tour done well,Good tour of an Iconic old stadium. Nice views of the city. Guides were enthusiastic and group was small. Got behind the scenes to a degree but dressing rooms were out of bounds.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tartan_penguin

50,Great Stadium,"Being a native Angeleno, Dodger Stadium has been a part of my life for many years. My father brought me there as a young girl, I took my baby sisters there and introduced them to baseball and of course, I have memorable moments from the times I took clients to the stadium for a night game. The Dodger Dogs are fair but a tradition. The beer is deliciously cold and the peanuts are divine. Going to a baseball game in Dodger Stadium is just plain fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deborahlynnt
50,Family outing,"I love being outdoors watching the Dodger's play...I have to admit that it is not as much fun as it used to be, I am always looking around, you never know when a fan from either team, has had a little too much to drink and that person might start something. I have been lucky so far that I have not been near any incidents, I will continue to go to the stadium and I will keep on being cautious. Food and drink too expensive",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Srnegotiator10
40,Play ball!,Nice stadium. Paid for pre-game tour mostly to see batting practice which didn't occur due to the LA heatwave. Neither team practiced! Realize it wasn't their fault but a little disappointed. Obviously not compensated for the lack of events. Got pictures on the field and the guide told us about some seats at the bullpen for the Dodgers so it kind of made up for the other. Interesting field location and loved all the palm trees surrounding. Can't tell it's one of the oldest. All in all good trip!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/11SuzanneS

20,old and dingy,"the last few times i have visited Dodger stadium, i didn't really care for it. the aisle's are tight, the stadium is dirty and the food...""horrible"" i remember as a kid getting ""dodger dogs"". they were good then, but the last 3 times i went and got dodger dogs they were over cooked and the buns were soggy from sitting under the heat lamp for some time. it really ruined my childhood experience of the Dodger dog. : ( let's talk beer prices..... $15 for a 24oz can of bud light? really... and to make it a Michellada (tomato juice ans some salt) add another $5 bucks. really? (so basically for a bud light michillada it would be $20. really sad pricing scary and expensive place to be. after the fourth inning we decided to leave as we already spend $70 on 2 dodger dogs, 1 garlic fries, 1 michillada and 1 glass of crappy wine.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dirkm755
40,"Nice Ballpark, Bad Parking","Dodger Stadium is very pretty and I really enjoyed my time there. My only complaint is the parking. It takes forever to get into and out of the stadium. I was surprised by the fans. As a St. Louis Cardinals fan, I was expecting the Dodgers fans not to be that nice (because we knocked them out of the playoffs in 2013 and 2014). But they were nice. This was our second time going for Cards-Dodgers Sunday Night Baseball, and I hope to do the same next year.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jibrielt2016

It is clean, and in great shape and the vistas are amazing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Srklaw7
40,"Fun, Fun, Fun","The Stadium is easy to navigate... went to an afternoon game with the temperature nearing 100 degrees, sat on the 3rd base/left field side to make sure we got shade.

40,Nice stadium and good organization,"This is the second baseball stadium I have visited, and it was a very good experience. The parking staff was friendly and helpful when I was looking for my parking spot. At the stadium itself the same. We were friendly spoken to and helped towards our seats. With enough food/drinks to buy we had a very nice evening and enjoyed the atmosphere. Leaving was a little more of a problem because everyone is leaving at the same time, but also good planning and got out quickly enough considering the amount of traffic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/862vincenth

40,Great experience,"From the national anthem right through to the end,this was a real experience of America. Not a baseball fan, but enjoyed this experience. Game is a little slow, but keeps you going with music and audience activities between innings. Food was beer, hot dogs and nachos as expected. Popular with locals and tourists. People very friendly. A good night out at a ball game. Easy to get tickets on the day on line for about $40 each( good seats ). Worthwhile to immerse yourself in a bit of American culture.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travrainbow

40,Good experience for us Europeans but way overpirced,"Went to see our first live baseball game to the Dodger Stadium. The free bus they have from the main station is great and very handy. If you are a tourist like us, use the bus! When you arrive and see how to parking works, you´ll see why.The match experience was nice but the prices, wow! If you think the prices at the stadiums of your favourite teams in Europe are high you´ll see what the poor Dodgers fans have to go through every game. Yeah the hot dog is tasty, but not worth the price you have to pay for it. And $13 for a beer? Really?! And it´s Bud not some hipster family brewery, specializing on craft IPAs..The ticket prices are fair in my opinion.What matters is that Dodgers won, fans were happy and that it was a good experience for us even though it was a low-scoring game.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Glemmy87

The pitchers were much better than the batters! But the Dodgers won & we enjoyed afew singalongs including take me out to the ball game in the 7th inning. The fireworks display at the end was average at best. What annoyed me was the inflated prices inside the stadium, $12 for a bud & $10 for a hotdog should be illegal! But they were tasty! The transport out of the ground was a nightmare! Don't take uber! We usually do everywhere but there's hundreds of people doing it, most complaining their drivers cancelled the collection instead of queueing, it took over an hour to get out the stadium, next time I'd walk out",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gurnico

30,"Great baseball, so-so venue","I hesitate to rate any baseball stadium less than excellent. We love baseball, and were excited to finally visit Dodgers Stadium. We were somewhat disappointed. Finding the correct parking lot wasn't the easiest given how they were directing people coming in. Then we found out the hard way that you can't just go in any gate, like most stadiums. You had a go into a particular one depending on your ticket. The stands were older for sure, which we expected. The food was way overpriced compared to other ballparks. In our sweep of the Angles, Padres, and Dodgers, this was the most disappointing.On the bright side, baseball is baseball, so it was awesome. The fans were fabulous!! The atmosphere was great as expected. The venue and a few logistics just need to be improved.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jen00TB
50,Classic Ball Park!,"This was my second visit to Dodger Stadium (last time in early 90's). They've modernized the stadium but kept the historic feel and beauty that it makes it one of the classic baseball parks in America. It's LA, so everything is pricey but you must go and experience it! The views from the home plate and base sides to the mountains are incredible! It's one of my all time favorites! For evening games, the weather starts warm and then drops 20 degrees as the sun goes down so take a long sleeve shirt or jacket! Surreal experience all the way!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luvpigeonforge

Even though this is now the 3rd oldest ballpark in the majors, it looks almost new. The recent renovations are awesome.

A lot of people today expect a cookie cutter stadium that takes attention of the game itself. Fortunately, I had an amazing experience with cheap seats and a great baseball atmosphere. The stadium is unique and beautiful simple as that. The concessions were great and the Dodger Dog is one of the best on baseball concessions.Unfortunately, what kept me from putting five stars is the maintenance or there lack of when keeping this ballpark up and going. If some decent money is put into renovating this classic ballpark it can be the best venue in baseball. Given the history behind this place I would say Dodger fans deserve a good face lift for this venue. Will be back for sure!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jacobh638
50,Great hot dogs! Beautiful ball park.,Go Dodgers! A fun time to catch a ball game in L.A.A gorgeous stadium. Take public transit and avoid traffic and parking. Shuttles to the subway to and from make it easy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheSPAonKing
50,Baseball at its best!,"Almost 60 years I've waited to see a Baseball game in the USA.I was not disappointed. It was fabulous.

50,Feeling historic,"Another stadium off of my bucket list. The venue is historic, people say old, but I say it's not plastic it's a real ballpark. The dodger dogs a must and a beer.Yes I'll return why not!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jrstwo
40,First Baseball Game,The stadium is a big business; slick and well run as expected. The Dodgers lost to Colarado which was a shame but a good night was had. The branded clothing was high end prices which I expected but I was surprised how expensive the snacks & drinks were. Two cans of beer for $30!! Hot dogs $11(?) Nuts; ice cream at $6.50. Not cheap to take the family.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NewForestView
30,"Nice Stadium, Very Uber Friendly","I've been to much nicer stadiums and am not even a Dodgers fan, but when in L.A.... We had great seats on the 3rd baseline and most food / drink items were priced where I expected them to be. We had a good time, but if I were ever in L.A. again, I would probably skip the Dodgers the next time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/myjenyoung
40,Baseball on a Sunday,"We visited Dodger stadium on a Sunday afternoon. As newcomers to LA, the dodger express from union station provided free and safe travel to stadium. The hotdog and beer were good. The merchandise was a little overpriced. However, a lack of stewards meant we had todo a bit of detective work to find our seats. Overall an enjoyable experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P781KVjohns
30,Needs a facelift,"Went there for the first time, this park seems stuck in a time warp, without the old time charm of a Fenway or the modern amenities of newer parks like Citizens' Bank. Nothing wrong with it, just needs some significant updating.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LDKRN
50,Dodger Stadium Great Experience!,"Doesn't matter if you are a Dodger fan or not visiting Dodger Stadium should be a priority for any baseball fan because it's the 3rd oldest Stadium behind Wrigley Field & Fenway Park and offers a lot of history. Walking into the stadium you can picture Kirk Gibson's home run in the 1988 World Series because it looks the same. If you visit this year you can still look up and see Vin Scully broadcast the game. The Stadium also offers some spectacular views of downtown Los Angeles. If you walk out to the outfield they have a giant bubblehead of Tommy Lasorda and can get a picture next to it. Also, they have giant rings of their World Series rings from the championships and you can get a picture next or behind them. I saw a game there between the Reds vs Dodgers and really enjoyed the experience and would go back again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MichaelLong1963
40,Great Traditional Park,"As a Baseball park Geek, this was # 21 in mlb, this right there with the Gotta sees. The only downside is the traffic getting in and out, allow yourself lots of time",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travel55025563570
50,A Slice of Blue Heaven,"Dodger Stadium offers a little slice of blue heaven in smog filled and congested LA. Tickets were reasonable and my husband surprised me by taking me to the Chef's Table before the game. Traffic was horrible on Saturday so we went two hours ahead of the game and we made it in plenty of time for drinks and a gorgeous Chef's Table. Yummy salads, roasted meats, pizza and more. You can call ahead for reservations or just walk-in. There are two seatings for evening games, one at 5:00 and one right before game time. I'm a die-hard San Francisco fan, so....it took me a bit to warm up to the Dodgers and I finally fell hard for the team. They whopped the Atlanta Braves 4-0 and with the easy stadium parking ($35) we were out in a flash back to West LA and then to home to Redondo Beach. What a nice way to spend the evening with family, going solo or with with your favorite mate. Not a bad seat in the house.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/544fabiennen

40,Take me out to the ball game!,"We bought cheap tickets ($27) but still had pretty good seats. (Section 35RS) We were pleased to have spent less on the tickets because the food is so expensive! We enjoyed it though, and you have to have food in a helmet and a dodger dog your first time at the baseball, right?The game had a great atmosphere and lots of action. It was a great experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JarlSz
50,Great Ball Park,We were staying in Venice Beach and the park was pretty easy to get to. With a free shuttle from Union Station. Great facilities,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/33Jess33
40,One more stadium I have been too,It was a stadium. Really nothing special. Dodger Dog was disappointing but not really much you can do to make a hot dog that much better than others. Food choices were limited in my opinion,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tigers8932
50,The Western Cathedral of Baseball,"Full disclosure, I'm a Dodgers fan who doesn't live in SoCal. My first visit was back in 2014 after a lot of the renovations and upgrades were completed, and let me tell you it was certainly money well spent. While the stadium certainly is old, nothing as far as I can tell is really decaying or decrepit. The bathrooms are nice and spacious, as are the concourses. My family loves the food and beverage selections, especially on alcohol as well, everything from cans to mixed drink cocktails depending on the booth/concession area.For the past two years the Dodgers led MLB in average attendance, and you could certainly tell walking around and especially leaving after a game. Don't expect to get out of the parking lot in under 20mins on average unless you leave early, even if you have ""preferred parking.""Definitely take a tour, especially if you can book one that shows the clubhouse, or if not do a pregame tour. You'll be able to see the Dodgers warming up and taking batting practice, along with the visiting team, from really up close in the dugout seats, a lady from our tour even got to take a picture with the NY Mets manager, who was walking by.Whether a Dodgers fan or not, this is a great stadium that needs to be experienced at least once even if your a casual baseball fan.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ajserrano1452
50,Amazing Experience,Never been to a baseball game before and this was a chance I wasn't going to miss out on. Had a fantastic time and great seats for about $35 dollars each,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/18annetteg
50,Great fun!,"I was able to catch a Dodgers game with a friend of mine. It feels very Californian with the palm trees by the score board! The food was good stadium food. We were able to have access to a special buffet restaurant in the stadium and the options were amazing, especially as a vegetarian. Lots of incredible salads and grain dishes. It was a fun crowd too, lots of team spirit!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sjkel
50,he Centerpiece of Los angeles,"It was an indication that Los Angeles had become a world-class city when the Dodgers moved here from Brooklyn. They obtained the premier site in the city of the angels, and built a fan-friendly stadium that welcomed the entire community",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/keithp867
50,Family tradition,"I have been coming to Dodger Stadium ever since I was little. It is a beautiful stadium that captures the essence of the 1960s design, yet is modern enough to keep up with the demand of today's technological need. It has gone through several renovations ad upgrades in the past 2 decades to keep with the changing times. Despite the many upgrades, the stadium is still able to maintain its identity as one of baseball's most cherished gems (it is the third oldest ballpark in baseball-1962). The stadium sits atop of a ravine and can be seen from different places throughout Los Angeles. The stadium is unique in that it was built into the hillside of the ravine.The main entrance to the stadium is the Sunset Gate entrance. The stadium has other entrances that are open on game days, but for the most part, Sunset Gate is the main entrance. Parking rates for Dodger home games are $10 in advance (online) and $20 at the gate. Preferred parking rates for home games are $35 in advance and $50 at the gate. Parking rates for large vehicles, including buses, motor homes, limousines and other oversized vehicles, are $35 in advance and $50 at the gate. The foregoing rates do not apply to special events (e.g., concerts, Cirque du Soleil shows, etc.). Parking rates for special events will vary. For only $5 (in advance or upon arrival), purchase parking for Lots 13 and 14 for home games. These first-come, first-serve lots are located offsite on Stadium Way - between 1000 Vin Scully Avenue and the 110 - and allow for easy entrance and exit. Note that there is an uphill walk to the stadium from these lots, of approximately 10 to 15 minutes. A free shuttle is available for fans with disabilities.Once you get past the gates in your vehicle, drive to your designated parking area (there are colored lines on the street to help guide you, along with ushers standing along the route directing traffic on where to go). Don't worry about not finding parking because the parking lot can hold 16,000 vehicles.As you drive around the stadium, you will notice that there are several entrances. Depending on your seats for the game depends on what entrance you need to use. You technically can use any entrance, but then you would have to walk through hundreds if not thousands of people to get to where you need to be. As you are driving around, you will see many oversized objects like autographed baseballs, World Series rings, bobble heads, etc. Feel free to stop by those objects and take pictures with them. It's a free perk, but do it early because the closer it gets to game time the more people will be there wanting to do the same. Before you can enter the stadium, you have to go through security. They will check the inside of any bags that you have, and you will have to walk through a metal detector. Once you pass security, if the are giving away any promotions for the game, this is when you would get it. once you are past this area, you can find your seats and take in the sights and sounds of the beautiful game of baseball. Or you can walk around and check out the many restaurants and shops that they have. You can enjoy the world famous Dodger dog which is a foot long hot dog (you have to have at least one) or shop for souvenirs and the many outlets around the stadium.The stadium also has tours that grant you access to areas of the stadium where the rest of the public cannot go. In order to book a tour, you have to go to the Dodgers website or go to the Top of the Park entrance and purchase your tour tickets there. The Top of the Park store has a ticket window on the outside where you can purchase tickets for the game or purchase tickets for the stadium tour. The inside of the Top of the Park building is the team store where you can buy official Dodgers merchandise. The merchandise ranges from t-shirts to key chains to magazines. The store is open daily from 10 am to 5 pm and open during any game played at Dodger Stadium.For the tour, you have 3 options. The first option is the regular tour and the following are the prices:Adults: $20Children (14 and under): $15Seniors (55+): $15Military Personnel: $15Children age 3 and under do not require ticketsThe tour is wheelchair accessible and it is a walking tourYou have 3 tour time to choose from: 10 am, 11:30 am, and 1 pm. This tour option starts at the Top of the Park store just inside the gates to the stadium. The tour guide will meet you here and scan your tickets until everyone in the group shows up. Here the guide will give you an introduction to Dodger Stadium and a little Dodger history. From here you will take the elevator down into the stadium to begin the tour. Feel free to take as many pictures as you would like, but be quick because they are on a schedule. You will get to visit the Lexus Dugout Club, which is the VIP restaurant and lounge located behind home plate. This is where they display the World Series trophies, Most Valuable Player (MVP), Cy Young, Silver Slugger and Rookie of the Year awards. I didn't realize they had so many awards. They have hallways lined with all the awards that the players like Jackie Robinson and recent Hall of Fame inductee Mike Piazza have earned. The restaurant looks amazing and sleek and upscale. They have pictures of Dodger players and Dodger history being made lining the walls of the restaurant. You also get to visit the Vin Scully Press Box where the media sits to cover the games. You get to see what its like to watch the game from this angle. You also get to visit the Bank of America Chairman's Suite which is really great. You get to sit in the seats that are right outside of the suite. These seats are the most comfortable seat I have ever sat in. It must be very relaxing to sit in the seat and watch the game from here. You will also visit the old visitors' clubhouse were baseball greats like Hank Aaron and Derek Jeter (although he played in the American League, the Yankees did play a few exhibition games in 1999, I attended one of them and watched Jeter hit a homerun) once suited up to take the field. You also get to step onto the field (just the warning track which is the dirt part before you get to the grass) and take pictures. Then you are led into what I think is the highlight of the tour. You get to sit in the Dodgers dugout just like the players do when they play games. This was an amazing tour and next year I will do it again because I didn't have enough time to take all the pictures I wanted. The tour was 1.5 hours long but it felt like it was only 15 minutes long.The second tour option is the Pregame tour. It costs $30/person regardless if you are a child or senior. You get to take a tour of Dodger Stadium before the start of the game. The tour is about 45 minutes long may include visits to: Club Level Memorabilia Hall highlighting the story of Dodger baseball, the Lexus Dugout Club, the old visitors' clubhouse, and early access to Field Level seats to watch the Dodgers batting practice (batting practice is often NOT scheduled for games played at 1:10pm and 12:10pm).The third option for a tour is the Clubhouse tour. The tour is about 2 hours long and you get to see everything from the normal tour plus a visit to the Dodger bullpen, the Dodger weight room, and batting cage. You get to peek inside the Dodger clubhouse and stop in the Dodger interview room. At the end of your tour, you get a small complimentary Dodger gift. Clubhouse tours only un select Saturdays and Sundays and are limited to a maximum of 20 people. Tickets must be purchased in advance and are not available the day of.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/earnestr
50,First Time Experience,"It was our first time at an American Baseball Game and I must say it was an experience to behold.The Stadium is a long way out of town so we got a taxi there and back which added to the expense but it was still a good night's entertainment.The American's really go overboard for their baseball much like we Aussies do for AFL and it was great to sit in our seats behind home plate, drink a cold beer and eat a Dodger Dog with all the rest of the supporters.If going to America be sure to take in a game or you will be disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JetsettingOzpatriot
50,Ist Ball Game,"First time to a ballgame,it is a great venue had great seats,bit disappointed with the famous dodger dogs not big enough! and pricey at $6 each.The traffic was a nightmare 2hrs to travel 20 miles but definitely worth it.Good fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MattK59
50,Must do optional activity,"We decided on a whim to watch a baseball match. Dodgers were playing Cincinnati Reds. What a great game and atmosphere. We loved it. The game was tight. But we delighted in soaking up the atmosphere, had Dodger dogs and blue/ white popcorn. A bit expensive in the end with add on charges. 2 x $35 tickets ended up costing $92USD, plus cheap parking, another $5. But in the end, still worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K3343MRkimh
50,What's not to like?,Obviously this venue is for someone who enjoys baseball and getting to see one of the few remaining classic baseball venues was fun. Extremely clean. Friendly staff. Good food. Easy in and out parking. We drove nine miles two hours before game time to get here and it took an hour on the freeways to get to our seats. Obviously the locals know this but out of towners like myself didn't think it would take that long to go 10 miles!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dps_Sedona

20,I'd rather watch the game on TV then sit in that traffic again.,"The traffic getting in is awful. Once you get to the stadium, parking is just as awful and expensive. Once the game is over, you're deal with the traffic again. The only way to avoid the traffic is leave really early to get there and leave the event really early before it finishes. No thanks! Not worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sdbooklover13
40,massive stadium with ridiculously expensive beer,Go there and watch Dodgers game. It is a great experience! Only downside is one of the most expensive beers that I've seen in my life - 14usd for below-average glass of draught beer.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/matejs
50,Nice place to watch a game,Went Tuesday night and got to see Kershaw pitch. It was a really nice place to watch a game. The setting was beautiful. A friend from LA has season tickets and took me to the game. The seats were on the second level behind home!! I had to have a Dodger dog and it was good. He talked to Roger the peanut guy and had him throw me a bag from the top of the aisle even though I'm a Red's fan. I luckily caught the bag. I was informed afterward Iwould have been booed had I dropped it. Great stadium and all baseball fans should go if they get a chance.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kysecretsquirrel

30,Another one off the list- not sure of this park,"Attended Dodger stadium for the first time. FYI- traffic sucks. Give yourself plenty of time for weekday game.We parked where we were directed and went to the closest gate. Very nice lady but told us we were in the wrong area and needed to go up 3 flights of stairs across some parking lots and to the reserved gate section. I can't enter that park at any gate?The man at the ""reserve section"" gate was a complete jerk. He wouldn't move and made us scan our own tickets on their machine. It was having issues and he wouldn't allow me to scan my 7 yr old son's ticket. He made me hand it to him, move thru the turnstile, my son couldn't even see up to the scanner, and made him try and do it himself. I went back and scanned the ticket and told the guy he was an idiot.Our seats up top were good and I think any seat there would probably be OK. I like faithful fans and I think Dodger fans fit that bill.I do have to say I was so disappointed in the ""Dodger Dog"". That's it? I heard so much about how good it is, saw an advertisement on the big screen with peppers and onions, and then bought it and found out it is only a regular hot that is 10"" long in a 6"" bun. I was disappointed. I went to buy a beer- $12 for a domestic small cup of beer? No thanks.I love the atmosphere, the game, and the history of the Dodgers and the stadium but I guess I expected a lot more from an iconic stadium in MLB. $20 for a hot dog and beer after $20 for parking seemed a little excessive to me. I'm glad I went and I'm glad I knocked it off my list but I was a bit let down of the overall experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nymetsfanz
50,Buy me some peanuts and Dodger caps!,"Baseball purist here. I believe Dodger stadium was the 13th stadium I have been to and I have to say I didn't expect the atmosphere to be so electric for a Monday night in early May. I love how the park is situated in the middle of LA, with views of downtown but up on a bluff. Really nice feel up there. The fans were into it, the weather was amazing and the ballpark itself didn't seem as old as it is. I couldn't be happier to have heard Vin Scully in the bathroom for the last season as well! Can't wait to call LA my home and hit up more of these!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tomifer213
40,Great views,So this was my 24th Major League Baseball stadium and I'd say it's in the top half. It's pretty spacious and didn't feel cramped with a good size crowd on hand. Parking is too much at $20 for the lot and not many options to park elsewhere and walk in. All the security staff and non concession stand employees were friendly. Great views from all over the stadium of the surrounding area and downtown LA. Appears most the sets had a good unobstructed view of the action on the field. Food and drink prices about same as every stadium. Dodger dog that I've heard about for years was long but nothing special at all as far as taste goes. I'd say more hype than anything. Go to Philippe before the game and get a beef dip instead. It's only a mile and a half away. The fans were not knowledgable about the game or the stadium like they don't go often at all. We were from out of town in St Louis and all these people didn't know where to go. They played music on speakers they brought it and seemed to enjoy hitting the beach balls around and drink more than watch the game after a couple innings. I did enjoy the history of being in Dodger stadium finally and walking around looking at all the displays and dodger stuff. Found good seats for less than face value on stubhub.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Banny9949
50,KB,Just a great place. Best team in the world. I have been to other stadiums and there are seats where you cannot see the entire playing field. I have never had a seat at Dodger Stadium that you could not see the whole field. Plenty of parking on the site. Again I have been to stadiums with very limited parking and you are walking more than a mile. Very friendly staff. Food is pricey but not anymore than other stadiums.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kylebistline

But...$$$$$$$$$$$,I've been a Dodger fan since the time I knew what baseball was.I used to go to games at 12 on the bus.40 years have passed and while some things stay the same others get worse.Particularly the obvious desire to make as much money as possible.Peanuts -6.50 a bagSoda-6.50 a cupBeer-12.00 a cup unless your drinking an import from a can. If so that will set you back 17.00Fries in a souvenir plastic Chinese imported helmet-15.00Laughable. Maybe Magic sets prices on what he can afford. It seems he forgot the typical family.

50,Fun classic ballpark,"Dodger Stadium is a classic ballpark offering good amenities and food choices. Not to miss is the Dodger Dog! One of the best ballpark hot dogs.

It was really fun to be around so many dedicated fans and families enjoying a beautiful so-Cal day. Some nice person even gave us a free parking pass!Not sure why so many people said that we had to get a Dodger dog, it tasted exactly like a cheap hot dog to me, nothing special, and certainly not worth the price. I would save my money if I could go back and eat at one of the many amazing ethnic restaurants in L.A. instead.We had the super cheap seats, and we could see everything very well. I really liked that there was a nice open air deck where we could walk around, or sit at a table and still see the game. A very nice stadium.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ArizonaDreaming
50,"Loved the stadium, fans not as nice as here in St Louis","Food was fine, employees fine but the actual fans we sat next to were not nice. Here in St Louis most of us treat everyone fairly but the hispanic fans in Dodger Stadium were not nice at all. Were very derogatory to us, a white older couple in Cardinals shirts.

When you have that many cars heading into one location there is only so much you can do. So definitely give yourself some extra time for parking. Once the hassle of parking is over the fun begins! There is so much history with this stadium. Being on the older side when it comes to major league ball parks dodger stadium is very well maintained and clean. There's not a bad seat in the house.

I decided it would be easier to ask directions to get to our seats - each Dodgers staff member / volunteer was very polite and helpful.We were seated at field level about 2 bays back of first base - pretty good seats to see the throws coming into first but not great to see what the pitcher was doing.We bought our tickets from an official re-seller (vivid seats) rather than directly from the Dodgers - this meant we got much better seats as they were less than half the face value price.The ""big screens"" are huge and have really clear pictures - it's sometimes easy to get drawn into watching them instead of the game!At times during the game there wasn't a lot of atmosphere / crowd participation. This really changed once the Dodgers got on top and the action on field accelerated.Food and drink prices are ridiculously high which was expected. The food quality is good enough I suppose but if you're taking a few kids you could easily spend $50 on food in no time at all - feed them before you go! $10 - $15 for a beer - at least they have some nice craft beers available.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stephenp795
50,Interesting Tour of Stadium / Awesome Place to Watch a Baseball Game,"We came out to LA to take one of our sons on a belated College Graduation gift...attending a couple of Dodger Baseball Games and touring LA/Hollywood/ Manhattan Beach & Venice Beach.My husband who grew up in Manhattan Beach and attended many baseball games at Dodger Stadium was not necessarily thrilled about getting up early to head over to the stadium for a tour. Once we arrived and throughout the tour he said it would have been a mistake to miss this tour. He/we loved it. He learned so much even though he had been to the stadium many times over the years. We started at the top deck and worked our way down Vince Scully's press room, original Visitors Locker Room, The trophy room and the Dodger Dugout and home plate. They had a photographer available taking pictures at home plate. It was a great tour with knowledgeable tour guides. I would recommend this to anyone who loves the Dodgers and / or baseball. It was relatively inexpensive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sunflowers1963
50,One of the finest cathedrals in all of baseball!,"You go to a baseball game to enjoy the game, eat some dogs, slurp some Pepsi and relax. You go to Dodger Stadium to wave goodbye to Vin Scully as this is his last year, eat Dodger Dogs, watch a mediocre Dodger team in the finest baseball stadium in the country",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MusicFlyer
50,One of the Best Ballparks in the Country,"Whether you're a Dodger Fan or not, you have to see a game here. I saw a game here and one in Yankee Stadium in the same week, and will take Dodger Stadium every time. It has an almost nostalgic ambiance, but is so well maintained it is more like a time capsule without the rough edges you see at some of the other older stadiums. Parking was readily available (although I had a hard time finding the stadium because the route is not well marked once you leave the highway). Make sure to try a Dodger Dog!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wedgewood
40,Dodgers vs Marlins,"Part of my LA visit had a game a Dodger Stadium as the center piece event. Not only did we see the game we took the stadium tour prior to which included stops at the Trophy Room, inside a luxury box, and behind home plate for batting practice. Don't just visit the stadium, take the tour!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dewaynep2016
50,Fun ball park!,"Whenever we go to a town with a major league ball team, we like to experience the ball park, and to go to the iconic Doger Stadium was a real treat! Fun ball park, food was a bit pricey, but we had great seats on the first base line. Parking is a bit crazy. But all in all a fun evening at the ball park!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/steveng73
50,Go Dodgers!!,Went to see the Dodgers play Arizona Diamondbacks and of course we won. Hadn't been to Dodger Stadium in years and boy has it changed. It was awesome and our seats were great.

50,Dodger Stadium is one of the very best in the Country,I have had season tickets here since they moved from the Coliseum. Dodger Stadium is fun for the entire family. Their 4th of July Celebration is fabulous and you get to go on the field. Check out the Dodger website to look for special events - they are first class Numerous different food selections seems to make everyone happy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GaryFleishman
50,"When in LA, go see a live Dodger game!","Dodger Stadium is pretty awesome, but it isn't cheap....plan on spending some money. Nonetheless, the energy here when the boys in blue are playing, and winning...it's incredible. Fun, exciting, this is a terrific stadium.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tommyo949
50,"Nice Stadium, Same Money and Buy Top Deck","While in LA, we bought tickets to a Dodger game. We picked the top deck behind the plate and it was excellent. The entire field was visible from the top and the Dodger fans were hospitable and friendly, a real family atmosphere. While the traffic was very heavy getting into the parking lot, the parking itself was fine and the access to the stadium was just a brief walk. A good take for all baseball lovers. BTW, the food is typical ballpark fare.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wxguy78

40,"Fun experience, historic stadium.",We had a great time seeing the Dodgers. The stadium has beautiful views and is a fun place to see a game. We walked there from or hotel and found there is no good pedestrian route. It's best to get there by car or taxi.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cougski
50,A must stop for Dodgers and baseball fans!,"I can only speak about my experience as a Dodgers fan: It was amazing! It's a wonderful place to be and, specially for a day game, it's a must visit. Actually, even if you're not a Dodgers fan, stop by and take in what must be one of the prettiest sights in all L.A.Do note that traffic backs up to get in and out of the Stadium. I'd recommend using the Dodgers Express, which shuttles you between the Stadium and Union Station (you'll pay for parking at US but it's cheaper than the Stadium parking).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mechafredzilla

30,Dodger Stadium,"Only stadium that I have been to where you're actually not allowed in at any gate and it wasn't clearly labelled where you go with each type of tickets. Not a fan of the fact that it's hard to navigate the stadium, they wouldn't let us go between levels, except for at the end when a kind usher escorted me into the top part when we walked by the gate. It's an old facility so obviously it isn't as nice as others but it's still worth it. The views are great, we sat in the outfield, the seats are uncomfortable as its a bench so I wouldn't recommend sitting in the outfield unless you're okay with the benches and having no room. Food prices were ridiculously high, highest I've seen at any stadium too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shawnpedersen

Sit along the third base sit for day games to avoid the sun",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/V4888OJdanielb
50,Beautiful Stadium,"One of two places in LA I definitely wanted to see when I was there. On non game days and before the season starts, the team store at the top of the stadium was open as well as the upper part of the stadium, allowing fans to see the field and take pictures. One day I will be back for a game. So much baseball history is showcased in the various monuments and exhibits they have ringing the stadium. Very picturesque with its iconic scoreboard set against the mountains.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StevenW590
50,Elysian Dreams,"If you love baseball or a history buff, or just want to experience something truly LA then there is nothing more local and genuine than a Dodgers ballgame. Dodger Stadium is the 3rd oldest ballpark in the US. Recent facelifts, botox, and liposuctions have given the stadium a much needed makeover and it is now state-of-the-art. If the game is sold out, head over to El Compadre Mexican restaurant just blocks away on Sunset and watch the game with local hard-core Dodgers fans. You'll know you're in LA when they score a run.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidbZ5668AE

40,A must for baseball fans,Getting in and out of the parking area is easy compared to the rest of the LA traffic.Down side is the size of the drinks. Justifies the expense but who really needs a drink that big.Food selections are good. Dodger dog was over cooked but other food was great. Garlic fries will definitely leave you with a garlic flavor.Thumbs down on not allowing kids close to the dugouts for pre-game autographs.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wfdeacon

Great views (inside and outside the park), lots of history to discuss, good access to press box, stadium, field, dugouts, etc. Tour guide Mark had tons of great tidbits -- who'd have thought this is now the third-oldest ballpark in the majors?!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amesman96
50,Must see experience for baseball,I have been at Dodger Stadium on three separate vacations. A must for baseball fans. Great Southern California experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dlessard11
50,Baseball Valhalla,"OK... I'm an unabashed Dodgers fan. Since the days of Don Drysdale, Sandy Koufax, Walter Alston, etc. Yes, the 1960's. And, that's despite living near two generations of Washington Senators teams and that team 30 some miles to the northeast of D.C., between Washington and Philadelphia. The 33 year baseball drought that began when the second Washington Senators team was taken south sealed the deal. I was a confirmed Dodgers fan for life. The Washington Nationals have not excited me. They are nothing more than the relocated Montreal Expos.But, alas, as years went by, between first parental preferences and then spousal preferences combined with scheduling, as the years went by I didn't get to see a Dodgers game. That is, until the evening of August 11, 2015. And, who would they be playing? None other but the Washington Nationals! So, being single second-time around, I finally got to see my beloved Dodgers play at home and not on TV.I bought my tickets online, using the Dodgers.com website that's linked to MLB.com. I bought the ticket and parking online in one transaction and had it e-mailed to my smartphone. Really easy transaction. But, when I got to Dodger Stadium, it only got better!Yes, the traffic into the stadium was slow. This is Los Angeles, OK? If I can get used to it, anybody can. The parking attendant and security guy at the entrance scanned the tickets on my smartphone and all was good. Really easy getting to my assigned parking space. And, unlike what would probably happen in D.C. or that place to the northeast, the space was not already taken! There was some impromptu tailgating in the parking lot and I got invited to join one group of people from the San Fernando Valley. Really good time. And, again, it only got better!My seat was up close, along the third-base line. Really great views of the action on the field. Yes, it took some walking. It wasn't cheap but not overpriced, either. But, it was worth it. The Dodgers put on a really great show in addition to the game. (The Dodgers blew-out the Nationals 5-0!) I had a Dodger Dog and a Pepsi (in a Clayton Kershaw souvenir cup), and both were good. Didn't see too many vendors for nachos, hot dogs, beer, soda etc., in my part of the stands. The highlight was during the eighth inning stretch when a security person asked me if I was enjoying the game. When I told her that this was my first Dodgers game after being a fan for over a half-century, she told me to go to Guest Services and they would give me a “First Dodger Game” certificate. Note that I said “give” As in “free”. It's now framed in my office.I stayed until the bitter end. I wanted so much to experience it all. Yes, it was crowded. But, the crowd was polite and friendly. Very orderly. Yes, there were police and other obvious security. No doubt less than obvious security, as well. This is post-9/11 America. And, it's to be expected. Yes, you go through metal detectors. But, that's about it. The Dodgers security and other staff members are extremely friendly and helpful in assisting you in getting around.Leaving the parking lot and getting back to the freeway did take awhile. But, having K-EARTH 101 (KRTH-FM 101.1) oldies punched-up on the car radio while waiting in traffic added to the Southern California feel of the evening.If you're from North America, and have never been to a major league baseball game, going to a Dodger Stadium is a must, whether you're a baseball fan or not. If you're visiting Los Angeles from overseas, I recommend going to a Dodgers game whether you're familiar with the game or not. It is a uniquely American experience that you'll treasure. It's not a cricket match. A game at Dodger Stadium is all that is right in not just Los Angeles, but in America. I've been to baseball games at D.C. Stadium, Qualcomm Park, and at the two stadiums in that place between Washington and Philadelphia over the years. But, the greatest baseball experience I've ever had was at Dodger Stadium. If you're visiting from overseas and your free time in Los Angeles allows you only one evening activity, I recommend a Dodgers home game. Yes, this is probably now the third-oldest baseball stadium, next to Wrigley Field in Chicago and Fenway Park in Boston. But, nobody does a class act of a baseball game like the Los Angeles Dodgers at Dodger Stadium. This is a Southern California “must” right up there with Disneyland for a first-time visitor. Yes, when my schedule permits, I'll be back. If I hadn't been facing an early morning departure two days later, I was seriously thinking about going back the next evening and doing it all over again!So, say it loud and say it proud: “Let's Go Dodgers!” <<Allons-y Dodgers!>> <<Lassen gehen Dodgers!>>",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/r0bertfb
50,The best ball park I have visited so far!,"This is the 4th ball park I have visited while working my way through a bucket list to see them all. And so far, this one ranks number one for me! The classic, simplistic, original atmosphere is what makes this one top the list. It isn't modern, or flashy, and you won't be overwhelmed with food options to choose from. But if you are looking for a true baseball experience on a hot summer night, this is the place to go!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Catmacdonald
50,My favorite place,"Sure, I'm a little biased. The Dodgers are my favorite team, but their stadium is great. I have been a little sad lately at the ""modernization"" that has been occurring. Many of the old signs and the old screen has been removed. Still there is a little bit of heritage that you can feel while you are here. Not to the extent of Fenway and Wrigley, but there is a good mix of new and old....now if just the team could stop buying washed up players...Overall, there are so many promotions and the stadium has a such a good setup, you will have a good time no matter where you sit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/McEasy
50,Can't wait for Opening Day!!!,"Nothing like a day, or night, at the ballpark watching the hometown Dodgers. Even better if you're lucky enough to score dougout seats!!! Dodger Dogs are not to be missed as one of LA's best dogs and long standing traditions!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kevinbO6152XY
50,It's worth the trip to one of the most iconic ballparks in America,"Dodger stadium is over 50 years old now. It's not only one of the most iconic ballparks in the major league's, when you go to a night game and when you seeing the sunset and the colors with the palm trees and the San Gabriel Mountains in the background, it's just magical. The Dodgers of done a very good job of cleaning up security after that awful incident with the Giants fan for five years ago. I think dodger Stadium is much safer and much more family friendly than it used to be. The ballpark food is decent-and like most ballparks tends to be a bit overpriced. But on the bright side you could actually bring your own food into dodger Stadium if you want to have your own munchies and save some money. I go to about four dodger games per year and I generally have a very very good time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rugbyrn60
40,Take me out to the ballgame!!,"Now one of the oldest BB parks, but remains an excellent place to see a game as the place and its environs are well maintained and sitting in the bleachers behind home plate gives you an excellent view of the entire field as well as a great view of downtown L.A. Something not to be missed on a visit to L.A.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tennisman2016
50,"Fun, even if you don't like baseball","Not a big baseball fan, but you can't beat sitting in the stands on a nice summer evening, soaking in the surrounds.

50,Great spot,"I recently took the Dodger Stadium tour. Driving thru the parking lot to the stadium gives you a spectacular view of downtown LA, a great opportunity for a photo stop.It's always fun to go behind the scenes and see things you wouldn't normally see on game day: the retired jerseys, the golden glove trophies, the World Series trophies, and many more. They took us onto the field and into the dug outs.It was very cool even for someone who doesn't know baseball.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sandyjpa

40,Great Tour From a Die Hard Fan,"We visited Dodger Stadium in February, which unfortunately meant we couldn't see a game there, but decided to do the tour. The stadium was great, and interesting to see a stadium of that era (1962) preserved as it was when it was built (or close to it), with 1960's style signage, etc. The tour takes you onto the field, into the pressbox, and into the part of the clubhouse where the team memorabilia is kept (World Series trophies, golden gloves, silver slugger awards, etc.).What made the tour, however, was the guide. He was clearly a die-hard Dodgers fan (I think he said he went to 74 home games last year), knew baseball/Dodgers trivia inside and out, and was good at engaging the tour group. Even if it's the off-season, I'd definitely recommend doing a tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L168BGadamm

50,Terrific Tour,"I can't admit to being a fan of baseball - but the tour of Dodger stadium is still worth it. The stadium is visually impressive, the tour is full of amazing history about the life of the Dodgers. It grants you access to areas that would normally be off limits or for the richest game day attendees. The tour guides were knowledgable, seemed genuinely interested to be there, and also interested in us the visitors on where we had come from and why we were there.Ihad the fortune of booking my tour on Season Ticket holder appreciation day so the park was open to all and busy - giving a sense of atmosphere. It's not too expensive to tour and well worth it.Was slightly difficult to find my Uber driver after the tour though!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PJMoore_Glasgow

We tried to book on-line and thought there might be a problem with the website, but found when we arrived that the tours were suspended that day. Better information wouldn't have gone amiss. That said, even if you went and didn't do the tour there is a good store with friendly staff and we found you can still take a look over the ground. Looks very impressive with some great views.Pity there wasn't a cafe / drinks station open - but there you go.Would like to go back to get a proper feel for the place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andymwood
40,Great place for a game,Had to go to Dodgers Stadium for a game. Even thought built in the 60's you can sense the history here. Large replicas of championship rings around the stadium. Great backdrop once in the stadium. Had a Dodger Dog which didn't disappoint. Great seats for not a terrible price. One thing is traffic is as bad as it gets. Went to a weekday game and it took me 1 1/2 hours to drive 16 miles. Other than that it was a great night.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tomg344
50,Brilliant Visit and the Dodgers won!,If you are in LA when the Dodgers are playing I highly recommend catching a game. We didn't know anything about baseball but really enjoyed the atmosphere and experience. Tickets can be picked up quite cheap if you book in advance and don't sitting in vertigo inducing seats. We had a great view from where we were. Getting there is easy - you can get the free buses from Union station - just show your ticket to the game.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EmmaStevenson1983
50,Third oldest park in the Majors,A perfect place to be on a summer night. They keep the place in great shape and the nighttime weather is glorious. Site lines are greaat but a good seat does not hurt either. The Dodger Dogs are a tradition although there is a wide variety of food choices. Bring a device so you can listen to the Dodger's hall of fame play by play man; Vin Scully.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/144sidm

40,Even An Angel Fan Has To Be Impressed With The Ravine,"As a child I remember listening to Vin Scully on my little transistor radio as he told us how brilliant Walter Alston (and later) Tommy Lasorda were as managers. He told us of the exploits of Russell, Lopes, Garvey and Cey. I remember clearly how magical the stadium was to me.This year my wife, step son and I went to the stadium and watched as the Dodgers beat up my beloved Angels. I was in full Angel Red colors. I was never uncomfortable. And, other then the stadium showing a little wear in the main concourses, she still stood proud. And, was every bit the elegant lady she has been for decades.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B2000NPfranks
50,First baseball game,"Staying with our family in LA meant we got to experience some of the local activities, this one being seeing the Dodgers play. I am a huge sports fan so seeing any live sport for me is awesome, but this, is on a whole new level to anything I've ever been to. Great atmosphere, great stadium, great facilities and a great team. I've now pledged my allegiance to the dodgers purely down to this experience and the fun I had. The stadium itself is remarkable and at the top tier, presents some stunning views as well. Definitely one for all the family and a recommendation for something to do. Go Dodgers!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/872jone
50,Somewhat biased :),Dodger Stadium is my home park so it holds sentimental value. But I have been to all 30 and it is definitely in the top 5. The recent remodel has made it seem a little more like disneyland but provides people of the selfie generation lots of opportunities. Avoid the headache and park at Union Station for about $6 and take the free shuttle bus to the stadium. Unlike other ball parks you cannot go to every level unless you have a ticket. You can go above your level but not below. Even for pregame autographs you have to have a set within the first 10 or so rows or they won't let you down.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/slash45
50,Our Favorite Stadium,"It's hard to believe, but Dodger Stadium is OLD. Of course, I remember when it opened.... And it's still the best. (just ignore the surrounding parking lots and take the free shuttle from Union Station). Dodger Dogs!! Great sight lines. Happy fans. We truly adore this place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/frankellen178
30,great if your a fan,"Dodger stadium is fun, and I don't mind the retro feel. But some of it is just old and the worst thing is getting out because of how it sits on the hill. Have not been there since all the security has been installed so I hope it is safer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travel1108
50,A True Classic,"This stadium is old school and I LOVE IT!!!!!!! Came here for a game when we were in LA. We always go to stadiums wherever we go when ball season is on. We love seeing each unique stadium, the food they offer, etc.This one is ghetto, but that adds to the charm of this stadium. We went to a night game and the sunset and the sky was amazing!!!!! The food by ball park standards was not like a lot of the other ones that offer up some crazy eats these days. But you will get your classics. The store was jam packed when we went in to buy some gifts. I would highly recommend checking this stadium out. It offers some great views of DT LA. One thing would be to get there early. We had a rental car and strolled around Hollywood before the game but the traffic getting up the hill to the park was at a stand still. I thought we were going to miss part of the game. There is only one way up the hill. So give yourself time to make it up and not feel rushed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashlee207

50,Born & Raised in LA! Dodger Stadium is AMAZING...,"I have been to Dodger Stadium so many times I cannot count them. I started going as a young child, played in City Championship Games there, gone to playoffs and World Series!! So many memories, I can't remember...lol",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/briancowan
50,Just Amazing!!!,"Visiting Aussies and we just loved the atmosphere, so different to our sports grounds back home... The kids had a blast and we really liked the piano music played during the game... The food was OMG great!!! Highly recommend anyone visiting to check out a ball game... Aussie Dodger Fans now!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/16tracymac
40,A true classic,"Visited here August 31 vs the Giants. Being a Blue Jays fan and wearing my Jays shirt to the game I wasn't really sure what to expect. Everyone was really nice and wanted to talk baseball when they saw that I was an out of towner. I got the spicy nachos with the dodgers mini helmet as a souvenir for my nephew who was attending his first ever MLB game, he loved it but we couldn't finish the whole thing. Climbing the hill was a bit of a challenge for him with his little legs, thank god for the escalators higher up. The location of the stadium makes for a nice view from your seat. I was shocked to find out the stadium offers free wifi, which came in handy because my cell phone doesn't work in the US. I would definetly return here to catch a game if and when I return to LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Harvman291
50,Fun day at Dodger,"Always fun to visit Dodger Stadium. Parking kind of sucks and having to walk up the hill--especially if you've got nosebleed seats--can be a pain, but worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EmBentley
50,MLB Stadium,tour opens at 10am for 20.00 gift shop opens at 10am too. a Nice view overlooking city a must for sports fans...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ac-canadian
50,Classic,"The view in the parking lot and then hearing the voice of baseball as you walk up through ticket gate you know you are were generations have loved the game. I'm a Redsox fan from Maine, that calls Fenway, Camden Yards and Busch stadium the best parks I've visited for a game. I caught a few games here in 2013 and I'm so glad I did. The park is not as good from a viewing the field and overall experience excitement of the three above but it sure beats many, many other brand new MLB parks.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Q8981HAdavidb
50,The best ballpark in the west,"Dodger Stadium is a true classic. The views and the history of the building simply cannot be matched on the west coast. For me the best seats in the house are in the top deck with gives you a perfect view of the stadium but also the parking lots and surrounding area. One of the unique features of the ballpark is that it is the only one in the west that completely divorces itself from its surrounding city. From seats behind the plate all you can see is baseball regardless of the deck or location. You just get to focus on baseball. While there you must get a dodger dog, the best Farmer John hotdog on the planet. Beware of parking, it can be quite a hike depending on both your seat location and the location of your car. Geotag your car in your phone for a hopefully easier find after the game.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DisneylandFamily
50,Take me out to the ballpark....,"Enjoyed a game at the stadium in May 2014. OMG do these guys know how to put on a ball game. My 13 year old son is a Dodger's fan and living in Australia it was the highlight of our trip to see them play. We arrived two hours early and walked around the outside of the stadium taking photos of the player characters.The ball game was amazing, the crowd was amazing, the game went into extra innings and the Dodgers won. A memorable experience at a fantastic ball park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jodi06

30,A typical MLB park,"Being from Michigan I've seen the old Tiger stadium and Dodger stadium reminds me a lot of it. An okay experience if you don't mind paying big bucks for a family to visit and eat. The dodger dog was nothing I would write home about. But, we can say we were there and that's why we stopped.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/766donalds
30,Historic but Shows its,"I have visited a lot of ballparks and I expected Dodger Stadium to be one of my favorites but was really disappointed. The facility definitely shows its age and the great views I expected over the centerfield wall were marred by the gift shop location. As expected in an older facility the concourses were narrow. What I really didn't like is you have to go in one entrance to be on the right level to get to your seats, whcih meant a logn walk around the stadium form the parking lot.Everyone should see it because of the history and the Dodger Dogs are great, but in terms of the park don't set your expectations too high",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/burghughes
10,Hate this stadium,"I'm obviously not a Dodger fan but this is not the reason I hate this stadium. I've been to other stadiums and this one is the worst. You get divided by ""class"" in this stadium. If you get ""nosebleed"" tickets you have to go to a different section of the stadium to go to your seat. Also, if you have nosebleed tickets, you are not allowed to go down to the lower section of the stadium.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OCTraveler23
50,Best Baseball experience in LA,"Find yourself overlooking the entire downtown and LA city. It's a must see just for the view. While you are there, take in the Dodgers winning a game. Not just winning but beating the other team. We're fans and they have a great stadium. Eat a Dodger Dog while you are there. A must try!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/route66motel
50,Go Dodgers Go!,"Well, I have been a Dodger fan for about 30 years. I haven't been to that many ballparks but I know Dodger Stadium is special. I go maybe 10 times a year and if I have visitors in the summer, a great place to take them. To avoid the parking cost and situation at the stadium(taking more than an hour to get out), I have started taking a bus from Union Station. This is perfect! Love how fast I get out of there and it's super convenient. Also free from Union Station with a ticket, although they never check tickets.Also the dodger dogs are a must! and try the Cool-A-Coo's, an oatmeal cookie ice cream sandwhich covered in chocolate.The beer is overpriced but about what you expect to pay at a venue like this. Love watching games here, there really isnt a bad seat, just a different experience. There is a lack of shade so wear a hat!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/377peggyd
40,"Once you are there, it's great","This isn't the best baseball stadium in the U.S. It's also a pain to get in and out (your worst fears of living and driving in LA, realized). But if you find a way to get there that doesn't involve driving in and parking (I think there are shuttles there from Union Station) you can avoid the worst part of the Dodgers Stadium.If you like to eat a ton of bad junk food, like you love All you can eat places, you can buy seats at the all you can eat pavilion, where you pay $25 for unlimited hot dogs, peanuts, sodas, water, popcorn. But you're sitting in the right field and can't see much going on except the chow fest around you. Normal tickets are around $11 for left-field bleachers but if you eat a hot dog, peanuts, and a soda, you're already up to around $25. However, people have said the quality is better outside of the AYCE Pavilion. I personally do not remember if the quality was worse or better but I would say the AYCE atmosphere definitely takes away from the game so if you're a die hard baseball fan, go elsewhere. If you go to baseball games to eat gross food and get drunk, then come here (though alcohol is extra). P.S if you plan to park here, the parking fee is exorbitant ($15-$25, don't quite remember).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/saikoxpooh
50,Who does not like baseball,"A day in the park is not cheap, but is worth it. Dodger Stadium sill lets you bring in outside food, and seal water bottles. The food in the park is fairly priced. Tickets are not cheap, but in comparison to other sporting events are a good price. Check out some of the resale prices, and special promo, 76 Gas always has some discounts and if you go online to the dodgers website you will find some values Just dress for the sun if it is a day game, Good walking shoes from the parking lot, You should purchase parking passes on line to save, also you can go by metro and get transport from the union station to the park. Great spot for couples and family or work events.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/552StevenA
10,Will Never Return,"Yesterday went to Dodger Stadium to see Cirque du Soleil. Parking was. $25. I was outraged. That is just pure greed. Then they are selling small bottles of water, soda etc for $6 each, popcorn and bags of cotton candy for $7.I will never attend anything there again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/90donnag
50,An oasis of relaxation ... and baseball!,"I love Dodger Stadium. It's all blue and green and round shapes, plus you get to cheer and yell. The finest sports announcer in the world, Vin Scully, does the Dodgers and has announced that, at age 85, he will give us one more year at least of his poetic story-telling. Play ball!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Techlady
40,Great experience,"Not being a big baseball fan before I was a bit nervous about what to expect but it didn't disappoint.. One of the best sporting experiences I've had from the staff to the atmosphere and crowd involvement., everything is about the supporters. There are bars, food, help and souvenirs everywhere.. The only trouble I found was getting there not being a local I wasn't sure in any other way to get there besides taxi which both ways could be quite expensive I think close to $100.. However I would pay that everyday of the week to go back in a heartbeat",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevenwF4804ZP

The stadium is currently home to the Los Angeles Dodgers and you can learn about the team and it's history in L.A. and, before that, New York City.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/buffalojim67
50,Fun for the whole family!,"This was my first MLB game and it was a success. We took a cab from our hotel in Downtown L.A. to the stadium. It was easy and cheap. I recommend doing this if you can. We were dropped off near (somewhat) the entrance and walked up to the stadium. We caught a glimpse of the famous ""HOLLYWOOD"" sign on the way. I suggest getting to the stadium early if you can. That way you can buy souvenirs, grab food and drinks, and locate your seat easily. It is a huge stadium but not too hard to navigate. The people working there are pretty friendly and cool - very helpful. The drinks are somewhat pricey but not anything unexpected. The margaritas that are premade are good and they come in collector Dodger's cups which was cool - it's a shaker with the team logo. The cheeseburgers tasted like carpet - do not spend your money on them. Buy a hot dog or pizza...not a burger, though. That is the only thing that was not worth the price in my opinion. We left during the 8th inning to avoid the foot traffic leaving the stadium. We didn't have to wait one minute in line for a taxi and made it back to Downtown L.A. in no time. I'd love to visit again - this was a positive experience. Good for the whole family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GypsySoulSC

50,Classic LA structure,"Dodger stadium is one of the last few stadiums that have remain the same for decades. The location is situated in an isolated area so they should be there for a long time. The seats have been recently upgraded and are comfortable. Make sure to have the nachos, garlic fries and dodger dogs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Donaldinc
50,Enjoyable (even for a Giants fan!),"As a Giant’s fan this was a place that I felt I had to visit. We managed to get tickets for Giants Dodgers game, due to the age of the stadium it is a different generation from AT&T however, in it own way had as much charm. It is worth a visit and if we are in town again we’d definitely revisit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Davetheaddick
40,One of onl three legendary stadiums still here,"In baseball there is Fenway in Boston as the oldest original stadium, then Wrigley in Chicago, then Dodger Stadium. Looks like it just opened in the last year. They take care of it and improve constantly. If you're a baseball fan it is a destination trip. Certainly not as cheap as it was, but what is anymore. I saw two world Series games here vs the Yankees in 1978 and our tickets were $8.00. Situated in Elysian Park it is a beautiful backdrop and just pristine for the third oldest park in baseball, and just like Fenway and Wrigley, never a corporate name attached. The only drawback is parking, get there early, and don't plan to get out of there any time soon. After a game from when you get to your car it can take an hour before you actually have left the property.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Beachkidboy
40,DOT,"We love Dodger baseball. The stadium offers a good selection of food and drinks. We purchased season tickets for a better price and sell the game tickets we can not attend. There is no tailgating and there are not any restaurants or bars in the area. We usually plan on arriving early and just use the restaurants inside the stadium. Parking is easy., but leaving really tests your patience. We do not purchase any parking passes that puts you closer to the stadium. It's much easier to park close to a gate and exiting is much easier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidtX1953XI
50,Awesome,We are from Canada and don't get to Toronto to see baseball at all so this was a huge treat for the kids. We were 5 rows up.

I don't know the game of baseball (or any other sport for that matter) and I enjoyed it so much.I used public transport from the Hollywood Hills area to get the game, it was extremely easy to navigate and very well organised. I picked up tickets very cheap online and just printed an e-ticket which I swapped at the stadium for an actual ticket.

I don't think there is a bad seat in the stadium.However, I really wish they would update their food and drink offerings and allow some updated restaurants to come in and serve food. The food selection on every level pretty much sucks.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shengtey
50,Superb stadium,We thoroughly enjoyed our visit here. The stadium very extremely impressive. There were plenty of food & souvenirs outlets available with minimal queues when we were there.

I wasn't disappointed with the stadium or the game (Giants versus Dodgers - going as a Giants fan) but getting to the stadium was a nightmare. This place is in the middle of nowhere, Los Angeles.

Using the public transportation and then walking I think is the best option to get to the stadium.

Nor more parking where you wish, they tell you the exact stall to park!Next, there is a lot of police and security mulling about. Our bleacher section seats were a reasonable $11 each, 1/2 the parking fee. The game was good, although the Dodgers lost. All concession items were very high in price. $7 hot dogs, $7 beers. Upon departure, our car was ""ushered"" out of the lot by a number of attendants. Freeway access was good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/busybeaks16

Didn't imagine it would fit so many people it was amazing. At the end of the night waited 2hrs for a taxi back to the hotel. According to the taxi company no one from Dodger stadium told them there was a concert on. The police had to go into town and escort the taxis in so people could get home. Other than that extremely long wait we enjoyed it but I didn't have to go to work the next day.

I went to the last game of the season vs the padres and the stands were packed. Fan Appreciation day was pretty cool, they gave away a ton of stuff. I was probably the only person in the stadium wearing Texas Rangers gear. They clinched that day.Dodger dogs are the best. I've been in all kinds of ballparks all over the country and nothing compares. Outstanding hot dogs.You can tell the stadium is a little older. My seats were row one in the top deck and my legs did not fit with the metal fence railing right there. Rows are not as wide as modern stadiums. I ended up moving one deck lower and it was great. The parking lot appears far away but it isn't. Five minute walk at best. It helps to know the layout of the ballpark and what level to enter on. I look forward to going back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ttocserpmada

50,WHAT A PLACE,"I loved it here. It's a big park, the biggest. Completely open but who needs cover in Southern California. Great views too of those palm trees and Elysian Park. A ballpark like no other. Visit here if you get chance. Catch the Dodger Express free bus from Union Station before and after the game. There are plenty of them, you won't get left behind.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/garstonian
50,Great night in an Iconic Stadium,"What a great experience, this was our second time to a baseball game after doing Anaheim Angels 3 years ago. Great stadium with a a great atmosphere made for a great first night in the US. Only downside was poor entrance signage, we ended up walking 3/4 of the way around the stadium to get to the right entrance gate.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OwenandSooz
50,Dodger dogs,"A historic stadium. Gotta check out a game and get a dodger dog. Even if you are not a fan of baseball or the Dodgers, it is such a great place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lngtraveler123
40,Great atmosphere but good luck finding your car!,Great fun to see a ball game. Even in the nosebleed seats we had a great view. The atmosphere was fun and the garlic fries delicious. This place is seriously huge so make sure that you take careful note of where your car is parked.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/larabe6
50,Dodger Stadium...a fan favorite!,"We visited on the afternoon that a game was to be played that night. Amazing stadium overlooks downtown LA. Gift shop had everything. And, the gates were open for us to look around and see the field. I bet a game there would be awesome! If you are a baseball fan, you must visit Dodger Stadium.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annette_j70
50,Dodger Express,"I love Dodger Stadium. It's historical and great place to see a baseball game. I try to see a game here every time im the City Of Angels. This year I decided to take The Dodger Express from Union Station because parking at Dodger Stadium is one of the worst I've ever encountered. Dodger Express is the way to go, it made it so easy to see the game. It actually dropped us of right where we were supposed to enter the Stadium, The Top Deck seats where are seats were. The Top Deck seats are a little high up, but you can see everything pretty good. Theres never a line at any of the concessions and bathroom is right around the corner. Lets go Dodgers 2015 World Series Champions :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DetroiterGuy
30,Place just isnt the same as it used to be,I used to be a season ticket holder. I have noticed over the years that the prices go up and the quality of people that attend the games goes down. Not much of a family friendly stadium anymore.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kristinmaried
30,Worth a look for a cheap ticket but stadium getting old.,Nice stadium to visit but pretty dated. We sat 2nd level inside 1st base. Great seats no obstructions.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robertpQ93PN
40,Nice Stadium.,We attended a AC\DC concert here. Main reason I am submitting review is to let you know you can probably find free parking along side streets off Sunset Blvd and walk about a 1\2 mile to stadium. Dodger Stadium is really nice and would love to see a BB Game here sometime. Think parking is $25 at stadium and they seemed to move traffic pretty good.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/faaradar

40,good old time at the ball park,as part of a sweepstake contest winner the sponsors took us out to the ball park. the night was a good night. the ball park is laid out well and views are good from wherever you are - either seated or walking the levels looking for food or refreshment or toilets. food was good and not overly overpriced. selection was good. exiting after the game was not crushing - orderly filing out. over all good stadium to watch a game.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tndawoods
50,"""Pretty"" ballpark","If there is a ""pretty"" ballpark, this is it. Sitting up on the hill overlooking the city, it's an old ball park but that history is all part of the charm. This is a must for any baseball fan during your visit to LA, and the Dodgers are a great team. Ballpark food is pricey so budget accordingly, you're gonna want a dodger-dog.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W8160GIss
50,"Not a bad crowd, enjoyed the game, Go Dodgers!","Go Blue!! Going to Dodger Stadium, I got to tag along with my best friend and her husband. Our seating was pretty good, since I love sitting in the Pavilion side, we were behind Left field, so I could stare at Andre Either's behind every time the Dodger's took the field. Not too shabby if I do say so my self, not only that, we were on the all you can eat side. Now normally all you can eat, I'm going to gorge, um no not today. All you can eat Dodger dogs, nachos, popcorn, peanuts, soda and water. Now the peanuts maybe a bit healthy, but I doubt it hahaha. All in all I had a great time with my best friend and I enjoyed the game at the Stadium, the crowd was awesome. Yes we lost :(",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/556shaunar

50,Awesome Stadium,"I'm a baseball fan so naturally while visiting LA, I caught a Dodgers game and got a famous dodger dog! It was a good experience given the fact there is so much history with the dodgers and LA. If you're a baseball fan, knock it off your bucket list!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ZexSwain
40,Great Staff comes through at this Grande Dame.,"This grand lady still has it! Attended the Sunday game, where it was close to 100 at game time. Having been hospitalized once for heatstroke, I mentioned to a Guest Services rep on the Reserve Level stationed near section 25 that I had hoped our seats had been in the shade (they looked like it from the stadium map we used when ordering them.) He immediately escorted us to the woman working the Guest service booth right there, and she was excellent. She called another GS rep. on her walkie-talkie, determined our needs, and kept helping a small line of others getting some sort of free drink promotion - all seamlessly done with a professional, pleasant demeanor. I am sorry I did not get her name, but I hope someone from the stadium management reads these because she was excellent - actually all 3 reps we dealt with did you proud. A few min. later, the 3rd rep. - this guy had the headphones on, and after inquiring if we needed a chair right then (my wife and I are in our 70s), proceeded to assure us he would find seats for us, which he did - I am thinking he located some unsold seats - and then reseated us -- again all done efficiently and professionally with a friendly demeanor.We liked the turkey burgers! good addition to menu. We did not like that lemonade was not available at every food outlet that showed the lemonade logo on the dispenser -- I had to go to three before I could get my drink. Also, you are probably tired of hearing this, the prices for the food and drinks is on the high side and the parking fee ($20) is one step short of outrageous.So high marks for staff and support, so-so for food and drink and a big raspberry cheer for the parking fee.And don't even get me started on Mattingly's choices!See you next game...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DrZ63
50,Great night out,"As part of a visit LA visit we watched a game at the Dodgers stadium, It was easy to get to and everything was really well organised, and had a fantastic family atmosphere, if you are planning a visit to LA I would recommend this as a great evening out, I booked it online prior to the holiday and everything was easy and went without hitch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rich1115
30,A very entertaining evening,Certainly plenty of parking. Hard to find anything healthy to eat and pretty much typical ballpark fare. Excellent variety of beers and hard liquor but at higher than normal prices. hard to believe that as good as the Dodgers are I had no trouble getting good seats.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/905stuarts
50,This review is for the Lexus Dugout Club inside Dodger Stadium,"This is the ultimate baseball experience. Dugout club tickets come with an amazing all you can eat buffet that has incredible selections. There are chefs at each station carving meats or preparing fresh dishes for you. Lots of staple classics too- salads, sides, dodger dogs, taco station, nachos, seafood, pastas and increditble desserts. Lets talk about desserts- this experience is unreal- yogurt, ice cream, pastries, donuts, cakes, gummie bears in the candy station. What's not included is alcohol from the full service bar. Its a Kettle One Martini Lounge so Kettle Tonic is my staple here. Snacks: the snack station is filled with peanuts, waters, soda, popcorn, chips, etc.. that you can continue to stuff your face with. Service inside is outstanding on every level.Now lets talk about the seats- its unbelievable how close the players are to you. You don't miss a beat with these seats. Balls come frequently so gotta stay alert! I usually sit behind the home team which is nice but every once in a while it is nice to sit behind the visiting team- especially if you are a fun heckler. There is also full service at these seats so if you are still hungry, you can order a lot of appetizers, meals,desserts and drinks straight to your seat. There are also food containers inside so you can pack food for your seats. This is truly the ultimate glutinous experience. But it is also the ultimate baseball experience because you get to see the players interacting so closely with eachother and the regular seat-holders. If you are a baseball and food fan, this is definitely an experience worth paying for (that isn't cheap).Last great thing about this place is the wall of trophies and achievements and history of the Dodgers before you enter the buffet. Exceptional experience all the way around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelinh1
50,Dodger Stadium Remains a Los Angeles Gem,"Dodger Stadium is aging; nay...compared to other stadiums it's actually old. However, it remains exemplary of great uncovered stadiums and is a lovely fixture in Los Angeles,Yes, it's history is controversial and somewhat colorful. It's history has become a major and interesting part of Los Angeles' ""recent"" history. Yet, it is magnificent as a ball park; exclusively built for baseball and continually up-dated and modernized by a ball club that cares for its fans.Worth a visit whether your team is playing, or not.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RichardG918
40,"Traveler's tip: if you love baseball, you should check it out","My husband's family loves the Dodgers; as is almost baseball-loving people in LA; so we come here frequently. The nosebleed areas can be pretty rough for some, so spend a few more bucks if you're not used to the rowdy, and very competitive crowd. We've sat there during lean years so we're used to the scene, but make the most of your first LA Dodger baseball experience by purchasing better seats. Better yet, pay a little bit more and get one of those all you can eat dogs/nachos/popcorns/nuts/drinks seats.I hate, hate this stadium's parking. There's also no walkable no-stadium owned bars nearby. If you have the time, take advantage of the free bus from the Union Station a few miles away; or cab or uber it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ligaya72
50,Great outdoor venue,Great place for family outing!! Family bonding time~ Enjoy the hot dog and beer! Sometimes the game might be too slow or boring but who cares? We are with our family or friends!The Parking: Private lot (FEE)... need to have patience to get in & out the parking lot.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ILoveFoodComa
50,Paradise atop the Hill,Talk about old school & the history of baseball well you found this paradise atop the hill of downtown Los Angeles. One of the oldest ball parks left & still in great shape. Chavez Ravine is a landmark location with amazing view of downtown Los Angeles. Dodger stadium has great sight lines threw out the park & famous Dodger dog a must since they are grilled to perfection. Of course listen to the silky voice of Hall of Famous Vin Sculley is a joy to listen to & the talent on the field is top notch with the like of MVP Kershaw a 3 time Cy Young winner & Greinke the potential winner this year is a must see check the pitching rotation for game & be sure to see them pitch a true master piece. The park is family friendly & interactive with fans with numerous things to see with the historic history of famous players & food is great. Enjoy the game. Parking is expensive !,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deller701

40,Historical,"Flea played the National Anthem for the game I attended. It's always a celebrity sighting at a game! I think that's part of the fun. Definitely get a Dodger Dog, though there isn't anything special about it. Head to the outfield and look at the giant replica world series rings, as well as a couple giant bobble heads. This place is HUGE. Such a fun time at the game when I went. I sat club level and had a great view of the field.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/293daniellep
50,"Pleasantly surprised, an elite stadium","Being the third oldest MLB stadium is not a bad thing for this gem in Los Angeles. Having completed renovations recently, this stadium is unique, has breathtaking views of mountains beyond the outfield fence, and a nice view of downtown LA behind the stadium. Is pretty secluded from most of Los Angeles and the walk up to the stadium is kind a strenuous. The crowd is fantastic and the Dodger dog ($5.50) is affordable and a must try. Much better stadium than the one in Anaheim.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/301calebk
50,Nice evening at Dodger Stadium,"Had a nice night at the park. Staff is extremely friendly and helpful. The fans aren't very into the team, more into the experience than the game. But that's La-La Land, I suppose. We had a lot of fun, the park is well maintained. Go in and out the Scott Avenue gate, no traffic there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NJTraveller123
50,Beautiful stadium with bad food.,"I love Dodger Stadium, but I love the Dodgers. But the food is bad, no other way to put it. And way over priced. Even the hot dogs, I make them so much better at home on my grill. But here's the thing that most people don't take advantage of, you can bring your own food. Drinks too, as long as it's in plastic bottles. Bring water, the bottled water there is I think $7.00 We bring our own peanuts too. We take a small cooler, you want it to fit under the seat, bring cups, plates, ice, food. I would buy the food if they had good food but unless you like nachos with fake cheese and bad hot dogs you are out of luck.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F5006CDjans

50,Go when the Dodgers are out of town!,"To experience the stadium in peace - visit when the Dodgers are away! The stadium is still open - the gift store is open! - and you can also go all the way up and sit in the stands! The view is awesome - you can look around the city, and just take in the surroundings. Was a great experience - recommended for baseball fans.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/qoom

50,Amazing tour,"We took the stadium tour and it was amazing! If you love baseball don't miss this. We got to see the Vin Scully press box, sit in the dug out, walk on the field, and see all the gold gloves, MVP, and World Series trophies. Every step was a photo opp. Our tour guide was great and had lots of trivia to share. If you bleed Dodger Blue this is one of the best things to do in LA!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/smctucson
50,Oldie but a goodie!,I love this stadium! There are good food options for most palates. I had great pizza at Lasordas in the outfield. The loge level seats I had were a great view. The parking lot was a bit confusing but they had plenty of folks to guide you. There is law enforcement everywhere so my safety was never in question.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Princerman
40,Ball park with great hot dogs,"Friendly and relaxed viewing of a top-level major league baseball team. Had a blast at the game with a Dodger dog in my hand. The ball park is showing a little age, but it's design (you enter at the top and go down to get to the expensive seats) is so different from most ball parks as to be a real treat for a long-time baseball fan. Sat just feet from Tommy Lasorda and Magic Johnson.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Earlyguy
40,"Classic Stadium, good food, good vibes","Dodger stadium is a gem of baseball stadiums as it is cut right into the side of a mountain. You can't see it until you pull up to it. Which I do have a complaint about.Dodgers, if you are listening, we went to a Friday night game, and sat on the freeway for an hour! 3 miles in 60 minutes, all because of the traffic trying to get into the stadium! I understand LA traffic is horrendous, but of the 8 stadiums I have been to in my life, this way by far the worst to get into!All that being said, the stadium was beautiful, it was a picture perfect night, and the Dodger Dogs are worth the $7 price tag. Also, try the garlic fries...delicious.All in all, I would love to come back here again!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StevieG350
40,Take me out to the ball park,"On a recent trip to Los Angeles I managed to make a trip to Dodgers Stadium. Good old fashioned baseball stadium! All the things you expect were on show!

50,"beautiful place, even for a Giants fan","As a Giants fan, I was a little nervous about going to 'enemy territory'. But I must admit, not only is the stadium beautiful, but the Dodger fans were very friendly and cordial (although we did endure some very good natured teasing about our team preference). The food is not as expensive as other stadia I've been to, the sight lines good despite the size of the place, and in general, very well kept. Great experience.Hint: Instead of driving, take the free Dodger Express shuttle from Union Station or the South Bay (Harbor Gateway Transit Center). Saves a bunch of time and $20 parking. Really a great service, and fun talking with the other fans on the bus.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MVFlyer
50,baseball!,"One of the nation's last remaining historic ballparks, with an interesting layout outside the stadium and a great view of the hills from inside.

50,"FOR THOSE THAT BLEED DODGER BLUE, READ THIS!","I have been attending Dodger games since the team headed out west from Brooklyn in 1958 and played at the L.A. Coliseum, and of course since 1962 at Chavez Ravine. The place is a shrine! There is nothing like walking the corridors of Dodger Stadium during a game and listening to the melodic voice of Vin Scully. NOTHING COMPARES TO THAT EXPERIENCE! Ok, you already know all of that. What I really wanted to say is this. Have you ever taken the tour of Dodger Stadium? I never had until last week. OMG!!!!!!!!!!! It is a must for any baseball fan, let alone any Dodger fan. You will learn about facts you never knew. You will see things you have never seen before. You will be able to sit in the dugout, the press box, a luxury suite just to name a few places. You will see all of the old photographs and steamer trunks used by the Dodgers back when they were in Brooklyn. You will see all of the golden glove, cy young awards, etc., that players have won over the years. You might even see some players coming into the stadium before the game. We did. Our tour was at 11:30am for a 6:10pm game against the Chicago Cubs. We saw Davey Lopes coming in, along with Josh Turner on some sort of a hovercraft gizmo propelling him down the corridor. He looked very cool. We also saw Clayton Kershaw working out on the field when we were sitting in the dugout. The tour is only $20, $15 for seniors. It is well worth it!!!!! GO DODGERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gregw534
50,Great venue!,"I am not a huge baseball fan but the Giants were in town so I went to the game. The stadium is very easy to get into and out of. The venders inside are very nice. The prices are what you'd expect from a sports venue about $10 beers and $5 hot dogs.The stadium is older but well maintained with clean bathrooms and venders are easy to get to with quick moving lines. The stadium big screens are viewable from anywhere and about any seat is a good one.The fans were friendly ""I was cheering for Dodgers"" but I wouldn't come here foot in for the opposing team as I did witness a few heated arguments. It was the Giants after all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J986LQbrianw
50,Love the Dodger Stadium,"Just went to a Dodger game (vs the Cubs) at the beautiful Dodger Stadium. We bought parking ahead of time for $35.00 in F, and it was worth it. Our seats were Field Level seats about 15 rows from the field. They were all in the SHADE and fantastic. I loved every minute of being there. The seat tickets were a Christmas present from my son. We had Dodger dogs, peanuts, beer and could of had more, but I was standing, clapping and yelling too much. WE had such an amazing time. I felt very safe there. They have elevators and escalators besides the stairs - and lots of places to buy hats, shirts, etc. It had been over 30 years since I had been to the Dodger Stadium.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SusieRussell
50,Great family experience. Go Dodgers!,This has to be on your to do list if you're visiting LA. The baseball is a wonderful experience. It has such a family feel.

I have not been to a a baseball game since 1974 when I first saw the dodgers and I tell ya the stadium itself hasn't change structurally but new seats were put in. Its been so long since I remembered what it was like at the time but I do know theres more variety of foods and drinks. Hot Dogs wrapped in bacon, dogs with jalapeño chili, and burgers to taco, or dinning in before the game. Very well organized parking and heavy security presence. All friendly staff. Hope I don't wait another 35yrs for a game.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DKom
50,We even touched the field,"A tour through Dodger stadium is a worthwhile experience for any ball fan - and not just fans of the Blue. The tour provides a glimpse through the back areas of the stadium that you don't normally get to see when you just watch a ball game. From the dressing rooms, to the memorabilia, to awards and trophy's. Brilliant tour that was made all the more special by being able to go into the dugout and sit in the owners seat - even Magic Johnson's! Awesome",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidsL7053XW

Going up to the top level has great views of the mountains and stadium. We had really nice seats in the Loge area, but there wasn't a cocktail/liquor bar on our level so that was kind of annoying. Not as big of a deal if you are drinking beer. All the bartenders we encountered were so nice but I will say the elevator staff was not all that friendly or helpful. Overall great time though.

10,There is a reason it's rated one of the worst!,"As baseball fans who lives in a city with no MLB team my wife an I were looking forward to our first trip to Dodger Stadium to see the Cubs play. Watching on TV you always see the line of traffic coming in late and leaving early. I now know all to well why. We drove in from Sherman Oaks, forty five minutes, but from the exit to the stadium almost an hour. Parking the worst ever with them charging you an extra ten if you didn't pre pay on line when you purchased you seats. View of the field from are seats great but viewing the stadium itself blah. Faded blue walls with tan seats and those ugly steel covered bleachers in the outfield. In between that is a gap with a speaker tower nothing else. Scoreboard awesome picture but organization of player and game info confusing . Signage around the stadium , bleak . Sorry Dodger Fans but these are only some of the reasons your stadium is in the bottom ten of stadiums. Use some of that parking money to do a little upkeep.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TonyR885

Check out the Stadium Club if you've never been.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luswei
50,Go Dodgers!,"This is really good night out if you like baseball and a great experience of American culture!The tickets are cheap and there are free buses from Unioin station if your a ticket holder. Drinks and food are plentiful, but quite expensive in the ground.A good experience if you fancy a night out in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gary0866
40,An Experience,"Having wanted to go to a baseball game during our time in the States (we are from the UK) we booked Dodgers tickets and parking ahead of time. They have a lot of different ticket prices, many of which are very affordable. Unfortunately, there was a heat wave when we got to LA, which made things very uncomfortable. Thankfully, the free gift on arrival was a water spray bottle with a fan! And, unlike many other poor spectators, our seats were in the shade. The atmosphere was good, and the food available insane (nachos in a Dodgers hat anyone?!). However, I have to say, baseball as a game seems quite boring. Nothing much happens! But then I'm not American, maybe I just don't get it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/873AmyB873
50,"Good stadium, boring game.","Nice stadium, but the game itself was not that exciting.It was opening day and Barry Bonds hit 2 home runs but I still left after 7 innings.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Greatwhite7
40,Great Fans,"The stadium was electrifying, the staff were friendly & helpful and the Dodger Dog was a hit. I thought the concession prices were a little high but the good time experience off set the cost. The lower level seats during a hot sunny day game is challenging, they get very hot & somewhat uncomfortable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mikea168
50,Game was great fun,"What an excellent stadium. Fans were great, Dodger Dogs were excellent and the family just enjoyed a fine SoCal evening at a game.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tomwF4249DP
40,Fantastic proce,Best thing about this stadium is you can get fabulous seats for a fabulous price! Make sure you get a dodger dog with some fancy fixins' to complete your experience!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ladyrbeatty
30,Sneak in...,"When the Dodgers are not playing, you can sneak in the stadium and walk around. Go to the gift shop which is open during the day. When they are not looking, sneak out the side door into the stadium. Walk around and enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JOHNRECERT
40,Good fun!,As an Australian it was really cool to go to the baseball. Super american!Make sure you go early as the traffic can get pretty crazy! Don’t buy tickets off randoms in the car park. We saw people do this and they turned out to be fake!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/173rhiannad
50,Baseball Tour Final Chapter,"This was the last stadium only my west coast. Are all tour. Dodger Stadium isn't one of the new type of ball parks being built around the country but it isn't.t as old and worn out as Fenway either. I got there early to tour the stadium and watch batting practice. It.s a. Ice stadium and worth the trip. It is a nice drive up to the stadium which I wasn't expecting. There is plenty of paid parking. The concession stand had the usual baseball park choices, but nothing special. Glad I was able to experience de it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maureenk885
40,Nice Park,Great ballpark and nice to cross it of our tour list. The lines for concessions are extremely long and the concourse is crowded. It's an older stadium so that is to be expected.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OneManWolfpack658
50,Great Atmosphere,As aussie tourists who had never been to a baseball game before it was a great experience for us. The only downside is the lines for food and drinks but it is all part of the experience. The stadium is amazing and it was great seeing everyone so involved in the game. Will definitely be going back every time we go to LA!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RhiJ254
40,First time baseball game,"Our family of four went to our first ever baseball game this week. We paid to go into the all you can eat area - free hotdogs (delicious)' nachos, popcorn, peanuts and soft drinks.The seats were a bit squashed but the atmosphere was friendly, there was no bad language and lots of entertainment on the big screens. We really enjoyed our evening.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/justamumWakefield
10,It's a dump,"Dumpy old stadium. Bad food and very expensive. Very annoying fans. Didn't not enjoy the experience at all, will not be going back",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G1277NAsteved
40,"Fun, but expensive!","Bought tickets and prepaid parking online. Easy parking. Hard to get around people when leaving. They need to have people paths and car paths to avoid literal mayhem. As to be expected, food was very expensive and not the greatest quality. Game was fun and personnel were friendly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Darkenwald007
40,Dodgers Game: Recommended!,"We (four people) went to a Dodgers game on Tuesday 11/8 to see them playing against the Washington Nationals. Highly recommended: great vibe, cool match and one of the best (and oldest) baseball stadiums in USA.Few notes: book tickets well in advance online (tickets sent via email), book a parking ticket in advance ($35 instead of $50 at day of event) and expect high prices for food (hotdog $8, popcorn $7) and drinks (water $6, beer $13). But well worth the money!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/douwev310
50,"Great Stadium, Great Tradition, Dodgers Win","We finished our California trip with a Dodger game, and it was a great time. Park is in great shape and family friendly. Got to have a Dodger Dog, not sure why but they are better than a regular hot dog. The only downside: Water $6.50 and Beer $13.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scotthelen12
30,Know what you're getting into,"I've been to a number of MLB parks. This was the most difficult to get into. First, no matter where you're coming from, you're going to hit a lot of traffic in downtown near the park. It took us nearly 30 minutes to go two miles. Then, when you get into the lanes to enter the park, that's about another 10 to 15 minutes. Of course nothing is marked near the entrance, so cars jockey to get the the correct prepaid or pay lanes as they make their way in. NOT efficient. We finally got a parking space about 3 blocks away from the entrance...that's an UPHILL climb to the gate. Then waited in line to get through security (yes, metal detector delay). Asked a couple employees to help us find our seats...the first guy referred us to another employee! The second guy wasn't really sure. Really? They pay these people NOT to know? Frustrating.I will say that once we got our seats, hot dogs and soda were decently priced for a ball park. However, peanuts were $6 a bag! Expect to mortgage your home if you want more than one beer.Ball game is a good experience and they do their best to have entertaining bits during innings. All in all, if you prepare and how long it will take to get into the park, you'll have a decent time when you get there. (Bathrooms were also some of the cleanest I've seen at at MLB game.)Tip: Prepay for your parking online. It will save you at least 1/2 the price of parking fee.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chgo919

50,If you love baseball and history -where else on the west coast than Dodger Stadium.,Love coming here with my family and absorbing the history and aura of Dodger baseball. They still have Vin Scully -what more can I say?! Come here and spend a wonderful afternoon or evening watch the all-american pastitme!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrBalan11

50,A great evening at the Dodgers!,We are a family of four from the U.K. on a road trip across the states and wanted to take in a ball game as part of our trip. We managed to get tickets to a Dodgers vs Oakland game at Dodger Stadium and had a great time. The food choices were good and the place was well organised.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ggm_devon
50,Training ball,Watching my youngest catch a training ball made his day and mine (wife to) to.We had great seats pitch side.So if you ever visit LA no matter where you are from ( I'm from UK) go to Dodgers game .The only downside is Coke 591 ml. $6. Food expensive to buy very nice.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrtash
50,Awesome ballpark!,"Even though the Dodgers were away, we stopped here to check out the stadium. The stadium gate was open next to the Team Store and we were able to walk in and check out the view from the upper deck. This is one gorgeous ballpark! We have been to 17 stadiums and this is definitely in the top three of our favorites! The staff at the Team Store were very friendly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Quest50States
40,Fun experience,This was our first baseball game and it was an enjoyable experience. We went on a Friday night for the fireworks which was a nice touch. Would defiantly recommend.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/663rachelf
40,One of our Highlights!,"Fabulous stadium - great atmosphere! Our first ever baseball game, and the children were so excited! Food was a bit on the expensive side, but good fun to sample all the vendors' goodies!Wasn't a good night for the Dodgers but hey ho! Can't have everything!We parked at the Dodger Stadium - had trouble rebooking for the lower rate so a bit annoyed but it was well organised and we had no trouble leaving the stadium (although it wasn't a busy night)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/loobeloo
40,Hard to get there but totally worth it!,"Dodger stadium is a real classic - even our tickets up in the second balcony were awesome due to the big screens and amazing crowds! People were so friendly and we were lucky enough to be there on free hat day too! It is difficult to get to dodger stadium unless you have a car, no trains go near it and buses are difficult. Prices of food and beer are obviously ridiculous (like at all stadiums), however they do have a nice selection of beers including some local craft ones. Overall, would highly recommend checking out a game at dodger stadium!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EmilyC234
50,Love this Stadium!!!!,"Dodger stadium is a must when in LA!!! We attended the tour; which was amazing for the price of $30 per person. Our tour guide, Mark, was a wealth of knowledge on the Los Angeles as well as Brooklyn Dodgers. My suggestion would be (especially on a day that a game is at 7:30) would be to attend the 3 pm tour. This was you get to experience batting practice too. You must get a Dodger Dog at the game!! We paid $25 for the seats in the outfield area... and we had a GREAT view!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JamPack1965
50,Beautiful stadium,"I surprised my husband with tickets for out family of five while we were vacationing in LA. We had a fantastic time. I paid for good seats on fanexchange.com to make it a nice time. We purchased shirts and hats at target before the game. So glad we did that, as the tshirts at the stadium were fifty bucks each. We went on Puig bobble head night. It was a quality bobble head, altogether one of ours broke when the 6 year old was trying to get it out of the packaging. Kids loved the nachos in a souvenir dodger helmet. Parking is a zoo, be prepared to walk around the whole stadium to get to your car. Expensive but worthwhile experience for our family!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/goodtimes-awaitin
50,Great stadium awsome atmosphere,Ever time we visit we enjoy it more and more the dodger dogs are great the nachos awesome and the also have a good double cheese burger so many food stands and all great . You will enjoy the atmosphere its a stadium you must visit when in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/989renem
30,Not impressed!,This baseball park doesn't compare to Safeco or AT&T. No one wants to help you find your seat. The people whose job it is are too busy talking to friends and totally ignore everyone. And why the beach balls being tossed around.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Guppy63
50,blue Heaven,Buy your tickets early to get the best prices. All you can eat pavallion is the best when you have young kids. Not to mention a great chance to get a ball!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Q7276YVlisam
30,Underwhelming Ballpark and Experience,"We follow the Royals (in the AL), so our knowledge and appreciation of Dodger history in the NL is limited. Having said that, this stadium was a one-and-done experience as it was boring and had no personality. No tailgating-really? I appreciate a historic ballpark, but this one didn't do anything for me except to hear Vin Scully. And those Dodger dogs were just plain-old long hotdogs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kurteg
50,One of the classics!,"This remains one of the best stadiums in baseball because of the setting. Nestled in Chavez Ravine, this park is tucked away from downtown LA. Seeing a sunset with the pink, cotton candy clouds above the stadium makes for a great start to any game. While day games in the summer can be hot, the evening games are beautiful. Friday night fireworks are a great addition, as are the many giveaway nights through the season. The concession are good and having a Dodger Dog is required. Some very good souvenir shops, too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jonr105
50,Great ballpark,This is a great stadium. One of the oldest ones still left. As a sports junkie that I am I couldn't miss the opportunity to stop by and catch a ball game. Great atmosphere atmosphere and very enjoyable. If you are in to sports. It's a must do.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dbo78

50,"""Take me out to the Ballgame""","I am an avid Dodger fan so this review may seem biased but I brought along my new Chinese wife who’s never been to a major league baseball game. I love Dodger Stadium. It brings back such memories. We visited on June 19th on a Friday night game against our rivals, the Giants. Unfortunately the Dodgers lost but it was still a Dodger game.Parking is even more expensive than I remember at $20 dollars. I’m not sure if it was because we were playing the Giants or not? We were there very early and were one of the first cars to be admitted but we were still forced to park very far away from the stadium which was a real drag but when we were leaving, it made it very easy to exit the stadium without much of a hindrance.The price of food has skyrocketed! I’ve been in China for the last four years and I don’t remember the prices as high as they are now, but nonetheless you have to get a Dodger Dog as they are the best I’ve ever had.The stadium looks to have been remodeled a bit and is as beautiful as ever if not more so because of the additions.If you are planning to go to a game, make sure to go on a Friday as they allow you to enter the field and watch the amazing fireworks display on the field of Dodger Stadium!My wife could care less about baseball but she was thoroughly pleased at how beautiful the stadium is and the quality of the food.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G3743BSdaniela
40,Fly into LA first you do that night hit a Dodger game,"My first night in LA i saw the Dodgers had a home game against the Phillies and i decided to hop on the bus and head to the game. Stadium was nice, tickets were awesome i suggest the $38 all you can eat option. Its in the outfield in the bleachers but you get all you can eat hot dogs, nachos, soda, peanuts and popcorn!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spartigus15
50,Great Experience,"Whilst in LA we decided to watch a Baseball game, I had never been before but really loved it.We parked pretty close to the stadium for free !! - Try and park on the uphill road that is off the dodgers way road.We purchased tickets on the day, the seller was really good and gave us some options for seating. We got great seats under covering, glad we did as it was so hot. Our tickets were $43.Like most stadiums the offical shop sold everything, but waaaay overpriced $50 for a cap lol, you can can get the same cap in Lids for $25 or less.There were lots to choose from to eat, hot dogs, nachos etc.During the game there was much going on, things appearing on the screen, crowd participation with the chants and songs. It was really good. Unlike here in the UK, seating wasnt really enforced, a family were sitting in our seats but we just sat in front of them and it wasnt an issue at all. Lots of people were moving and siiting anywhere really, within in reason.I would def do a another Baseball game again. Loved it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrGayle80
40,Not bad for the 3rd oldest stadium in the Majors,"We have been to about 20 MLB stadiums over the country. This has a great setting is the LA area. We were in the outfield and the bleachers are a little tight, but fun none the less. People were all very nice and no stupid behaviors present. Huge variety in food and drink, BUT EXPENSIVE (not a surprise any more in the MLB). Parking was easy and convenient near the stadium, for a fee of course! So worth the visit, good game, Mets WON.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SteveB749
50,Lots of Fun!,"We sat in the right field bleachers where the ticket price included all you can eat hot dogs, nachos, peanuts, popcorn, and fountain drinks. Row A allowed us to see right fielder up close (Puig) and my hubby even caught a ball thrown by Puig! Parking is expensive and quite a walk no matter where your seats are. Take a light jacket or sweatshirt because it gets a little windy when the sun goes down.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/311micelist
50,Great Ballpark,"We had a stopover in LA and decided it would be fun to see a Dodgers game. It took approx 40 minutes to drive from our hotel at LAX to Dodger stadium and parking was cheap and easy, (the only tricky part being the size of the parking lot, be sure to remember where you parked).The facilities were excellent, shops and stands for caps, tshirts and memorabilia. Food and drink outlets were reasonably priced and good quality, with play areas to keep the kids entertained.The stadium itself is very impressive, clean, well laid out and the atmosphere was amazing, totally family friendly. The entire area was well policed and even walking away from the venue in the dark after the game, we felt completely safe.Thoroughly enjoyable and would recommend to anyone even if like us, you are not a baseball fan, go and enjoy the spectical.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Philippedubock

40,"NIce Park, good views, poor food","My wife and I went for a three game set in May. We sat in different parks of the park all three games. Any seat or section seems to have a great view of the field and also of the palm trees in the background. The only down side to this stadium is the food. I have been to several major league stadiums and this place had the worst food of them all! Over the three games we tried several things and they were all over priced and well below average in quality. Pizza was tasteless, pretzels were overcooked, dodger dogs were burnt, etc. However the fans are passionate, it is a unique stadium and the views are great from anywhere in the park, overall a great ballpark, a must see for any baseball fan.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/970jamesz
40,Beautiful ballpark with great views,This is a must see for any sports fan.Dodger Park is beautiful with views of the mountains and downtown LA in the distance.The only thing I hate from being from east coast is dome fans coming late and leaving early common basbeall to great of a game for that.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/josephd75
30,Worth seeing but not great,We bought bleacher seats not knowing you were cut off from the rest of the seats. This made exploring the rest of the park impossible. It felt like being on the titanic segregated to my own section lol. The game was fun and there was some good people watching to be had! We thought it was funny that there were LAPD officers pacing back and forth on the top few rows of the bleachers still wearing sun glasses when it had been dark for a few hours already. All part of the fun :),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Halendaskid
50,Road trip to see last of west coast teams,This is one of the best stadiums ever for traffic flow! What a breeze to get in and out. The food was okay; nothing that unique (crazy crab sandwich at rival SF Giants is #1) except for a gluten-free kiosk that offered edibles. The stadium is clean and the seats were great. We were treated to an awesome night by ace Zack Greinke (Phillies are having a rough year). I was disappointed there were no postcards in any of the gift shops & the pins for sale were kinda boring. Love that shade of blue!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WeGoMama
40,great but could use a renovation,"As a baseball fan this was the 14th stadium that I have visited. Compared to other stadiums, this one was by far the largest est. I was surprised however to find how tight the rows were in the 100 level and there wasn't much personal room. Regardless, the experience was still great and we enjoyed the different dodger dogs that they had to offer. Both the frito pie dog and big kid dog (with Mac n cheese on it) were both tasty and unique to any other stadium that we have visited. Worth catching a game here- only wish that I could have seen Brandon beachy pitch as we are atlanta fans.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ATLgirl7
50,First Major League Game!,"Dodger Stadium is very nice and clean. The staff was very helpful and friendly from the parking attendants to the popcorn vendors. The die hard Dodger fans were polite and we all participated in the ""wave"". The Dodgers were very accomodating and won in a thrilling last inning win. The food was hot and delicious. Don't forget to get a Dodger Dog! After the game, there was a beautiful fireworks display. We really enjoyed the game.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/awallacenevada
40,Family fun,"We had a great time. We sat in section 28h and it was great seating. It was super hot. Make sure to put on sunscreen. There are a few okay areas for the kids however, they are medal so they were hot. And the nacho helmets were located in one place over by section 1 so that was difficult to get to. Overall it was a fun family entertaining time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kourtneyj2013
50,Dodger fans from PA,"We traveled from Pennsylvania to see three Dodger games. The stadium can be difficult to get around if you want to see batting practice of an opposing team but otherwise it was great. The food was good, except the brisket sandwich. Very soggy bread and not near enough sauce. Most food prices start at $9 and go up from there. No issues with seats, the crowd, anything. Luckily we walked because parking, well, that's another story.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MelissaP230
50,July 4th Tour,"We went on the tour July 4th game day. Great way to spend some time seeing all the hidden gems in the stadium. With the history of the Dodgers, lots to see and take in. They have a Trophy Case showing off, Gold Cloves, MVP Awards and a couple of Worls Series Trophies. Also, they have a jersey area showing all retired Jersey numbers and stories on the players that wore them.on this tour we had the chance to catch early BP by the Dodgers and you had the stadium to yourself. Great afternoon. The tour guide was very knowledgable o nthe building and the histroy of the team. I will be back on non-game day to see into the press box and the clubhouse. Thanks!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeanL514
50,Very fun!,Cool stadium. Fans were considerate and supportive of the Dodgers. We sat in the pavilion with all you can eat seats - this is a great option! Went to a 7:10pm game - weather was perfect. They keep the fans involved - overall a great time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/li_walk

40,A great (but expensive) LA past time!,"Dodgers Stadium is a beautiful old ball park (3rd oldest in the MLB) nestled in the hills of Elysian Park Heights. Is there anything better to do on a warm summer evening in LA than to sit and watch some great Baseball and eat Dodger Dogs, nachos, peanuts, and sipping a beer? I'm not even a Dodgers fan, but I always go and watch them play a few games each year, because I love Baseball and this stadium really captures the essence of the sport.A few musts:- Dodger (all beef) Dogs - load 'em up and make sure to get lots of napkins! I personally seek out the stands that offer them grilled, which isn't every one, so for a little extra oomph, it's worth seeking them out!- Get there early and stay to the end. In typical LA fashion, many don't show up until the 3rd inning and leave after the 7th inning stretch. Normally I scoff at these people who clearly don't care about the game, but at least it makes navigating the crowds before and after the game easier.- Take the bus! Dodgers have a bus that runs from various parts of town and only costs a few bucks each way and drops you off at the front door of the stadium. Parking is between $10-35 so depending on how many people are crammed into the car, you may want to take the bus!A few dont's:- Don't expect to see a game on the cheap. Sadly since the ownership change in 2012 ticket prices continue to rise and are now to a point where it's nearly impossible to get the seats I used to get. But if you want to sit somewhere in the middle and buy snacks, and pay for parking, expect to pay an average of $125 per person. YIKES IS RIGHT! (Stubhub for tix!!)- Spend all night making a sign telling the Third Baseman you love him. No signs allowed.- Don't get seats in the outfield ""Field Boxes"" unless you don't like beer and you are most certainly a Dodger's fan. This section does not have alcohol and does have very very hard core fans. Everyone I've ever encountered in the main stadium seating has been very nice to me when I wear my Reds t-shirt and I've had friendly rivalry with the Dodgers fans around me. But some other friends of mine were not so lucky in the Blue seats when they wore their Phillies jerseys. Let's just say they luckily got out alive!All in all, I love this stadium, whether I'm rooting for the Dodgers that night or not. But do be prepared for the expense. It's too bad that families now struggle to go to games and have the opportunity to experience the action up close and personal. But maybe that will increase attendance to the Farm Teams - where there is just as good of Baseball and hot dogs, too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NikiMustTravel
40,Great ballpark,"Interesting location and design, this is a ball park and team that cherishes their history.The only disappointing thing was the food....we had heard that their food choices were very good, but I'd say it was average ball park food.Also, at a sell out game, don't expect to get out very quickly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ajfsurvey
40,"Beautiful Stadium, Even for a NY Fan",Went to see my Mets play the Dogders- the stadium is just beautiful. The food courts serve an array of delicious items and the park attendees are truly helpful and made us feel welcome. Glad I had the experience! Plus my Mets won so it was a double treat!.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Goldenbluize
50,Everyone should go see the Dodgers!!!!,I loved the match it was the Phillies vs Dodgers. This was not the most exciting game however it was great fun! Everywhere was clean and despite the food and drinks being over priced it was a great match. There were some loud men behind us but that did not down our spirits. The game itself was really long so we left just before the 7.5 th innings. Stay for the song as we missed it and were annoyed that we did. I will definitely be going there again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/499Kit_Kat
50,Beautiful old stadium,This stadium has that older feel that so many of the new stadiums are lacking these days. It has a lovely open feeling and has a nice view out to the surrounding area. We went to a night game and were witness to a pretty spectacular sunset happening behind the score board. The food was not anything too exciting but that didn't really ruin it for us.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/33AnnA
40,Old but great ballpark,"I travel to Southern California often. I always tried to catch a ballgame. Dodger stadium is a classic. Not the easiest to get to,but once you get there, it's amazing. Love the views and the fans. Don't forget to try the Dodger dog. One of the best. Great team, very competitive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dylanz2014
50,Take me out to the ballgame,"Dodger Stadium is a great ball park. There are no fancy frills in the park, but I do like eating in the Stadium Club which opens a couple hours before the game.....the food is good there and so worth the difference in the cost of tickets. If you do not want to spend that kind of money, enjoy the Dodger dogs and other food available. Choose your seats carefully and realize it can be hot depending on where the sun is shining. There is plenty of parking around the stadium. Try to arrive early before the game to watch the warm ups.....I believe field vip tickets and map tickets come with access to the Stadium Club.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/448cheriep
40,Memories of 1964,"The first time I was in Dodger Stadium was 1964. The days of Koufax and Drysdale. Each visit since brings back those memories. The stadium hasn't really changed that much. There are still the iconic pavilions in the outfield. It's a beautiful place to watch a ball game. On this most recent visit, we had great seats behind home plate. Dodgers won which makes it great. The biggest disappoint was the concession ran out of onions. A Dodger Dog with no onions, sad. Negative - parking, not so much the parking as the ingress to the stadium lots. Slow as molasses. Negative - concessionaire prices - 5 hot dogs and 1 soda. $40 and no onions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marylouiseh2014
50,Classic Baseball Experience,"Classic baseball park. For a classic,true to the sport venue, Dodger Stadium is what baseball is all about. While there have been many updates (added restaurants, shops, bars, renovated restrooms) this is a no frills park. This park is not about hot tubs, frilly eateries, or fluffy mascots, its all about the love of baseball. May good places for typical baseball food and lots of beer. Tip: When purchasing tickets consider the time of day and where the sun will be positioned. Its SoCal, where the sun always shines, but can be a bit warm. Play Ball!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traveling_gal801
50,Great experience,The Dodger Stadium is only a short car ride away from downtown and is very easy to get to. The parking is spacious. The food is excellent.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jstravel117
50,Classic ballpark experience,"Dodger Stadium is a Southern California sports experience. From the crack of the bat to the atmosphere of the stadium, you are guaranteed to enjoy a great day.We like to get to the stadium early and walk around and check the views. You can catch batting practice and see players warming up. The staff at the stadium are friendly and helpful.We attempt to buy the best tickets we can. Some tickets come with access to the Stadium Club. The Stadium Club is an upscale dining experience that has a buffet, menu, bar and sit down restaurant that overlooks the field. This is a great spot to sit for a bit for the unique experience. You can dine pre-game as the club opens 2 hours before the first pitch. Field VIP and MVP tickets include access to the club.Tours are available and although I have not been on an official tour I have had access to the entire stadium. I would suggest the tour. There is so much to see. Enjoy dodger stadium for a unique experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zkrscasa
40,Great time,"Other than the drive to get there, this is a great experience. Spacious parking lot, easy access. Food easy to get to from anywhere in the stadium. Good variety of food. My only negative is trying to drive there plan hours nit minutes, unless you are downtown already.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/695judj
50,Family Ties to Pee Wee Reese,"I grew up a Yankee fan and even have an autographed baseball by Babe Ruth. My Dad crossed paths with the Babe and played against Pee Wee in semi-pro baseball in Indiana in the late 20's and early 30's. However, growing up I was mesmerized by the pitching of the great Sandy Koufax and had always wanted to visit Dodger Stadium. That became real on June 15, 2015 my last day in LA. The stadium to me is rich in history, Pee Wee Reese, Koufax, Drysdale, Lasorda to name just a few. The stadium is surrounded by mountains and the stadium stands out like a rose! When it was built in the early 60's it is yet today the only MLB park owned by a city. The rich Hispanic neighborhood adds to the quaintness of Dodger Stadium. The ballpark is clean and very scenic adding value to the sightseer. The Dodgers were out of town so my boys and I missed an actual game in Dodger Stadium, however we saw them play the Padres @ Petco Stadium. If you ever near LA one must make a stop to see this historical ball field and you just might hear Vince Scully calling a game in the background. Very nice merchandise store to pick up remembrances of Dodger ball and your visit. The view of the city from the entrance is breathtaking. The only downside would be the parking prepare for a very long hike.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/795philiph
50,Nostaligic,I can't believe how much I enjoyed my evening at the Stadium! I live in KC so I am a Royals fan and I only attended for a business function in one of the suites. It ended up being a Fantastic night! We went and sat in the cheap seats too and enjoyed the game even more!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ssclay
30,Fun American pass time,"Enjoyed very much but everything was WAY to expensive.. The food, the beer, the parking, the souvenirs, just crazy! Considering the cost of the seats, one should expect the parking to be much less. Would love to know the profit margin on the food/drinks. Why gouge?! I'm not a cheap skate but this bugs me! I believe they would sell more concessions if the lowered the cost thereby still profiting. Nice time good visibility.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/8diannac
40,"Fun, Classic","I'm not a Dodgers fan (I'm a Nationals fan), but I love baseball and the whole Americana thing, so going to a game was a ""no-duh"" sort of thing.Aside from baking in the sun, the experience was really fun! The stadium offers a classic baseball-viewing experience. Because it's the third-oldest stadium in the country, there aren't a lot of high-tech, attention-taking things going on, so everyone's focus is on the game.A fun thing about Dodger Stadium is that celebrities frequent games; we saw Rob Reiner and Ja Rule!The food is pricey, but that's a given at a baseball stadium. The garlic fries were top notch and the Dodger Dog was perfect on a summer day at a baseball game.Parking was easy, but pricey ($15 for general parking).I'd highly recommend making your way to Dodger Stadium for a great day or night at the ballpark!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J7373DRlaurap
50,First US Baseball Game,"Never been to a stadium in the US before. Dodgers has ample parking and the ease to get into the stadium was great.

50,The Best Place To Watch Baseball,"The biggest plus is watching the greatest team in MLB play!This stadium is the perfect blend of old school and modern technology. When Magic Johnson and his investors took over, they made improvements throughout the property. Nice bathrooms, every kind of food you can imagine all all kinds of merchandise, including Hello Kitty Dodger apparel! Not to mention the entertainment provided between innings. For day games, the view out past center filed displays the beautiful San Gabriel mountains framed by palm trees. For night games, it is worth the walk to the edge of the parking lot after the game to see the stunning lights of downtown L.A. in a way you cannot see anywhere else.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PandoraSD

30,"Clean, plain, spacious stadium.","With the exceptional history of the Dodgers, one would think they would celebrate it more at Dodger Stadium. There is little reference to their history with the exception of a Cy Young Award winner mural, retired numbers and championship years acknowledgement. Outside of that, the stadium parking was easy in and out, the food was typically priced for baseball stadiums and it was very clean.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BCMorris

30,"Historic, yes. But dated and expensive","Expensive tickets. Limited and even poor food options with only a single provider. The history of how this stadium came to Chavez Ravine is also troubling. Still, it is the Dodgers. I had no problem getting in and out off of 110. But then I was there on a night where it wasn't even close to being sold out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tennisbump
30,Great day out but expensive,"Had a great day out at the Dodger gameLast weekend, atmosphere was great and loads of fun had by entire family.

50,Fascinating Dodger Stadium Tour,"If you are in LA and are a baseball fan this is an excellent tour. You go from top to bottom of the stadium and see a lot of interesting things including the press box, the trophy cases including batting, Golden gloves, World Series, Rookie of the Year, MVP and Cy Young Awards. You also tour a luxury box and go out on the field and into the Dodgers dugout. If you are there on a game day you may even see a few players.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/692edz
50,I finally can say I ate a Dodger Dog!,The Dodger dog was worth the wait! It was a last minute decision to go to the game and it was sold out so we went for the standing room area at the top of the stadium. It was fun! The views from up there are fantastic. We had a great time!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SunnygirlC
50,Great Traditional Ballpark,Our family had a great experience at Dodger Stadium from watching the pre-game warm-ups up close to the delicious Dodger Dogs. There was even a great give-away.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KHoopDallas
50,Dodger Stadium - 'A Home Run',"The new owners who took over a few years ago have made Dodger Stadium a prime attraction. All amenities and food services (Dodger dogs, garlic fries) have been upgraded to first class. Plus, the team has gotten better, contending for the title every season now.If you like baseball, you'll like Dodger Stadium. It's a prime setting to play and watch a game. The oppressive heat often found in other stadiums is sometimes relieved by soft breezes straight from the nearby Pacific. Plus the temperatures are usually comparably milder than elsewhere.LA is more of a baseball town than you realize with so many other attractions nearby. The seats are usually mostly filled with cheering fans doing the 'wave' as they cheer on their Dodgers. The cheap seats in the outfield have the advantage of being located near the bullpen where it's fun to watch the pitchers warming up. If you're a fan, it'll be a treat - if you're new to watching MLB - this is a great place to start.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/John363
40,"LET'S GO DODGERS, LET'S GO!","Outstanding experience. The LA Dodgers played San Francisco Giants and won 10-2. We were able to roam the stadium freely and the atmosphere was incredible. The food inside the stadium was very good (I had chicken parmesam sandwich) and reasonably priced. The FREE, yes UK sports fans you heard it right, FREE shuttle buses into various parts of LA are a godsend.The only reason for it not being a 5* review is the bar staff seemed very reluctant to serve either alcoholic or non alcoholic beverages from around the middle of the fifth innings. A minor issue but still detracted slightly from my overall experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tomdesborough23
50,Home of the Dodgers,From outside Dodger Stadium you'll get a amazing panoramic view of downtown Los Angeles.Inside the stadium you'll find a great ball park athmosphere.The ballpark has a fanshop and enouhg food and drink options.Public parking is available at the stadium and there is a free bus line between Union Station and Dodger Stadium.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Costiaan
40,Great Game and Terrific Experience,Today we I were introduced to that great American tradition - baseball. The atmosphere and the spectacle as well as the whole experience including the hot dog was well worth it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Outandabout1208
40,Play Ball!,"Small but intimate ball park. It needs revamping, but who cares?! It is baseball so the important part is that all the seats have a great view.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KimVee
40,Iconic baseball stadium still looking great!,"Great seats thru StubHub, first row aisle on loge level, a little to the right of home plate. Around $260 for 2 seats, but so worth it. Unfortunately the same can't be said of the stadium cuisine. Cardboard-like pizza, garlic fries lacking salt, stale peanuts, so-so Dodger dogs. Food is the only negative about the stadium. Fans are great, pretty classy, in my opinion. They don't yell obscenities and rag on the opposing team as much as in other stadiums. Getting to and from the stadium was a breeze using the free Dodger Express bus from Union Station. Friday fireworks night was great. Fireworks were exploding over our heads while in line for the bus. I've never seen fireworks so up close. Great experience! This and Sugarfish by Nozawa made for a wonderful vacation before meeting up with the grandkids at the happiest place on earth.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lynette760
40,Big Stadium,"We went to the Dodgers/Diamond Backs game last night and had a great time. They have added a lot of seating on the field, we didn't sit there due to the excessive cost.Pro's: You can see the game from almost every seat in the house, great weather, lots of energy, comfortable seats, we sat in the Loge Section behind(note even numbered sections are on the 1st base side, odd are on the 3rd base side).Con's: Parking is expensive, Food is expensive, Food service is SLOW(It took an entire inning to stand in line behind 8 people and get a Dodger Dog(grilled), beer and a water, bathrooms are small and spaced too far apart. Ticket prices are higher than other stadiums but it is LA everything is expensive.........There were 48,000 people watching the game in the stadium the night we went and the staff seemed overwhelmed. There is security/police everywhere from the parking lots to the stadium itself, fans were well behaved and rooting for the boys in blue. If you are in town do yourself a favor take in a game at Dodger Stadium you will have fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/randys101
50,Nice Stadium,We went on Memorial Day and the stadium parking was super easy to find. It was our first time there. They however did not open the gates to park for 30 minutes after they stated on their website. So we sat in our cars for a good 35-40 minutes waiting to park. The stadium had plenty of food and vendors. I was NOT a fan of the Dodger Dog... was not worth $8. It had a hard bun and just a bit warm.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TamiM506

50,Let's Go Dodgers!,"Beautiful Dodger Stadium, Some tips to consider are the even numbered sections are on the right field side of the park. Daytime games will possibly have you sitting in the sun. Leave to the park early, traffic can be bad. Don't drink in the parking lot, Cops everywhere. Look for autographs from old Dodger players near the big outdoor bar on the Left field loge level. All you can eat right field pavillion is a great deal especilly for a group with kids. Beer, drink lots of beer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/701keithe
30,"Great game, poor stadium policies","First, it was an awesome game, and great staff! Here is the problem, if you have a higher ticket, you aren't allowed to the other levels during the game. Doesn't seem like a big deal, until you want to head down to the Nike team store, but can't because it isn't on your level. Overall great, but the company missed out on some purchases!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zbuxton

40,Livin' the Dodgers Dream,"We had a great afternoon at Dodger Stadium! The giant sized beers and margaritas certainly helped! I was impressed with the prices for tickets- there seemed to be a lot of options and something for everyone. We caught the metro to Union Station from Hollywood, then caught the free dodgers bus to the stadium. I highly recommend this for those of you without a car- it was really easy and well organised. We hardly waited at all and it was $1.75 each way pp! I'm not sure about the famous Dodgers dog though! I thought it was more like a 'dodgy dog!' Even still it was all part of the fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NM21_GC
40,Go Dodgers,"This what happens! I knowing there friendly competition between San Francisco Giants and Los Angeles Dodgers! I from Bay Area! Okay, but someone in Sacra once ask me, ""Ma'am, if Dodgers and Yankees playing in World Series, who do you root (I think that means CHEER) for?"" He getting angry when I say, ""Dodgers of course!"" He say if I from Bay Area, I supposed say New York Yankees, me, ""Why? I cheering for California team, besides, never been to New York!"" Realize, he from or of Sacra, I not think when met him there was not ever minor league team! Now there is Sacra River Cats, they represent my home town Oakland Athletics!Go Dodgers! I remember 1988 World Series, Kirk Gibson Game One of World Series hit home run, limping around the bases! But hey, that I cheered for Oakland Athletics! Any other time, say if Dodgers and Colorado (DENVER) Rockies, I will have cheer for Dodgers! So what if one time was Brooklyn Dodgers and New York Giants, I was not around (BORN) when both moved to California! Go Dodgers! Besides, I remember this stadium! Very beautiful! Is on Elysian Park, not sure Avenue/Boulevard/Street/Way, zip of 90012, Salvation Army zip is 90015, Food Bank zip is 90058!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/988karync

40,Good Time at a Classic Ballpark - Pay in advance for parking for easier access,"During a recent trip to the L.A. area I made it a point to get to a Dodgers game – more to see the stadium than the Dodgers themselves. I wasn’t disappointed. Dodger Stadium is one of the last classic stadiums left in Major League Baseball.I attended a Sunday afternoon game with my brother-in-law and nephews and we sat in the lower portion of the upper deck in right field just past first base. I think it was section 36. The views were spectacular – more magnificent than they look on TV. I recommend looking for tickets on StubHub or a third-part vendor as I was able to get seats for considerably less than face value for a perfect Sunday afternoon.While at the game I had a beer, Dodger dog and garlic fries. Concessions are pricey – but concessions at every ballpark are expensive these days. The Dodger dog is legendary so I had to try one, but in reality it’s just a big (footlong?) long on a regular bun. Good, but nothing special. The garlic fries on the other hand were excellent – spicy, with lots of fresh herbs and garlic. So good. They would have been better if they hadn’t been a bit soggy, but that was my fault – I got them from a grab and go stand to avoid waiting in line, which meant they’d been sitting in a container under a heat lamp. I’m sure they would have been crispy if I’d waited in line for a regular stand. If you get garlic fries, be prepared to be kicked out of bed for days... despite brushing my teeth multiple times I had garlic breath for at least two days... totally worth it!The only disappointment at the Stadium resulted from Dodger stadium being built at a time when ballparks were designed to keep people separated. In the later innings I was trying to find a souvenir for my dad and was trying to get to the Majestic team shop that had just been advertised on the jumbotron. I asked how to get down there, but was told only people with field-level tickets could get there. This is counter to most newer ballparks that allow people to circulate more freely. Oh well, their loss... I was trying to get down there to spend more money.We happened to be at a game on a day with the “Kids Run the Bases” promotion, so we stayed after so my nephews could run the bases. It was a really neat perspective to be able to get on the field and see Dodger Stadium from there as well.One last bit of advice... the Dodgers own all the parking around the stadium and you can buy a parking pass in advance for half the price. We zipped right through the pre-paid line quickly and easily whereas the paid lanes were backing up.Overall, a great trip to the ballpark. The stadium is definitely worth the trip and you should definitely go if you are a baseball fan.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Need2TravelMuchMore
50,Fantastic night out,"What a great place to take the family at the end of a hard week at work. If I lived here I'd get a season ticket. It's not just about the game, it's the whole atmosphere and there's even fireworks on a Friday night. There are also free buses to Union Street station after the game and you can ask for a first timers certificate, obviously only if it's your first time! Highly recommend if your visiting. Put it on your list of must do's while in LA. It's much more fun than driving around in a bus looking at celebrities front gates!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Termer13
30,It is an OK place to see a baseball game...,"I have been to a few Major League Baseball stadiums and in my opinion, this is my least favorite.It had a weird way to get to my seat where I walked next to a area with a temporary looking fence. Then I get to my seat and it's covered in bird poop. Thankfully it was rainy and not a lot of people showed up so I was able to seat in a different place. It is California, but I also thought it was very expensive for food/drink.What I did like was up on the top floor, they had a little Dodger museum with a lot of really neat memorabilia.I am glad that I went, I always like to try to hit a baseball game when I travel. Next time, I will go see the Angels though!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vacation_Commander
40,A good time at Dodger's Stadium,"We recently attend a Dodgers game, we found purchasing tickets online a bit confusing. There seems to be a lot more sections to pick from then other stadiums that we have visited? We ended up in section 31 reserve, ticket prices were affordable for a family, at approximently $40.00 each. We were thankful that our seats were between 3rd and home, we originally wanted to sit on the opposite side ( near first base), the seats on that side were in the sun for the whole game whereas our seats became shaded halfway though the afternoon.

The Dodger organization can be very proud of all of their staff. Without exception, everyone we came into contact with was sincerely friendly, helpful, polite and enthusiastic. I never felt so welcomed as I did at Dodger Stadium. From the tour guide, the host at the Dugout Club, the wait staff and did I forget to mention the ball players and the great Orel Hershiser, everyone was proud to be part of the Dodgers organization. Orel Hershiser even got on my phone, and spoke to my son and joked with him.Hats off to a new era in Dodger baseball. Los Angeles can be so proud of the Dodgers.

It is not like the new stadiums they have been building in the last 20 years but I personally love it as it suits the area well. Also the stadium concentrates on Baseball, not on an overall entertainment experience like the more modern stadiums do.This time I'm here for a four game series against the Colorado Rockies. The first game, 14 May, after enduring a 1.5 hour rain delay in the 6th inning saw a great Rockies comeback 5-4 with Cargo crushing a two out three run HR with two outs in the 9th inning.Next night, 15 May, was fireworks night.

Went through the carpark gate, apparently i couldn't find any other entrance as i was there for the first time. Showed the security my booking details and such, he gave us the direction. But it was a looooooong walk up a slope through their parking lots. When we finally reached, there wasn't anyone up there to lead us. There was however a signage for the tour. Stood there thinking someone will be out but no one. However, i did saw two girls standing in the stadium, turns out they are actually the tour guide. well instead of waiting for visitors to enter, they should take the initiative to come out and sorta make an introduction. they only come out after noticing that ive been staring at them for long. the tour itself was just okay, the guide could do even better. they dont seemed prepared. i was impressed with the stadium itself though. very pretty. all and all, it was just okay. maybe will go again for a game.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jannah_hair

50,The best baseball stadium,"Dodger Stadium is my favorite stadium to watch a baseball game in. It has an old time feel, they still have a live organ player! Great food, you can't leave without having a Dodger Dog. Sit close enough to the field and you may have an opportunity to hit a beach ball around and try to keep it away from the ushers lol! Fans are very into the game which makes it a fun experience. The palm trees and mountain views are great as well. Go for a fun, authentic, old school baseball game experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joeb381
50,Great experience!,"This is one of the best ball parks to visit and , I have been to a few! They really know how to treat the fans right. We came early and my son was able to go on the field . The sky was blue all day without a cloud in the sky. I do not know how they do it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z9222KOmikep
50,Great Ball Park,"What a great venue to see a ball game. The entire experience is worth a visit. The facility, the staff and the fans make it a memorable experience and can't wait to return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StevenM419
50,Must do for foreign visitors,As visitors from England & Norway we decided to try out a baseball game and we loved it !! Tickets were cheap and easy to obtain (we used StubHub app). Free shuttle bus from Union station to the stadium. Great atmosphere and experience with everyone very friendly yet passionate. Food and Drinks relatively expensive but that's expected at a major sport event. Lots of interval entertainment too which keeps the innings breaks interesting. Would love to go to a game again,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peachiepagan
50,Jackie Robinson day,"We went to dodger stadium on Jackie Robinson day and i have to say the staff from the vendors to the stadium security were brilliant all polite helpful and cheerful, 1 guy whose name we never got even took our names and got us a 1st visit to dodger stadium certificate and magnetic schedule,the 1st 40,000 fans that night got a replica Jackie Robinson jersey free, the ballpark itself is worth visiting as it looks good even for a stadium this old, i would love to return to watch another game at doger stadium in the future maybe even a playoff game, If your going to L.A. make sure you take in a dodgers game.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Msu1969
50,Gotta go!,Its a pilgrimage to one of baseball's historic ballparks. Get a Dodger Dog and wash it down with a $14 beer!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MKEAmyS
50,Great ballpark!,"Took in a Sunday afternoon game against the Colorado Rockies on a very nice, sunny day. The conditions couldn't have been better. We enjoyed every minute, and were fortunate to be sitting in the Club Level so that we were in the shade, which at Dodger Stadium is difficult to find. Food concessions were pretty average, typical of most MLB ballparks. What sets this off from others is its location, which is away from the major city in a park setting. Looking out from home plate you can see trees and mountains above the outfield fence. Can't get any better than that! Highly recommend going to a game here should your schedule permit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BostonRedSoxFan2004
40,Friday night fireworks a must!,"If you are visiting LA and want to see a Dodger game, my best recommendation would be to go on a Friday night as they have a fireworks show after the game. It's really well done and they even let you sit on the grass part of the field of you want. Kids absolutely love this! The stadium itself is up to date with lots of food choices. Dodger dogs are about $5.50 these days and expect most food to be priced above that. Parking is a bit pricey at $20 per car so be prepared. There really is no easy way in or out of Dodger Stadium. Parking lots can be horrendous so expect to be stuck in them for about half hour if you stay the entire game. But on a Friday night, you must stay! The show is pretty spectacular lasting about 15 minutes in length. Just make sure to bring a sweater or jacket as you will feel a breeze at night here. And most of all, bring your spirit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carolinelomeli
50,Perfect night out!,"So it helped that the Dodgers won, against a divisional rival, but I'm reviewing the stadium I know ;)We caught a train to Union Station and took the Dodger Express shuttle which is FREE and drops you near the gate! There is now way I'd try and drive/park. The atmosphere around the stadium is fantastic. As soon as you walk through the gate you can see some of the field and it doesn't take long before you see the rolling hills behind the outfield. The dodgers fans are fun to be around and seem to enjoy the game without taking it too seriously or getting over the top.There are plenty of places to eat and buy merchandise. The food is reasonably cheap but the merch was over the top. Buy it elsewhere. As a previous reviewer mentioned, the stadium still feels old-school but in a good way. It hasn't been overrun with electronics/lights/noise.The friday night fireworks were fantastic and a great idea to let people onto the outfield to watch them. We had no trouble getting a shuttle back after the game - we lined up for no more than 10 minutes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MikeStrachan
50,Let's go Dodgers,"Dodger's stadium, blue heaven. Everything just so nice here, and you can get great deals on the tickets, on most days. I don't know why, but the cheap tickets on stubhub are usually under 10$ in dodgers stadium, but if you go to Angels/Padres games, they cost you something in the 40$ range. boo those teams. Dodgers are way better. General parking is 10$ if you reserve in advance, 20$ at the gate. A great deal. Preferred parking is 35$, not so great. You can't go wrong visiting this stadium",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VamsiK859
50,Once or Twice in a Lifetime Visit!,"This was the first visit for my children (6 & 11) and husband. I had been here once before a few years back. We went for an Exhibition game of Dodgers versus Angels since it was significantly less expensive than opening day. The excellent was alive for the two area teams, but everyone was extremely polite and friendly.We had a handicap parking pass and that was our only problem. Three different people told us three different places to park. By the time we actually parked, it was much further than it would have been. Only thumbs down.Like many other ballparks, there is lots of food and drink at high prices. Plan ahead by bringing some snacks along, or have some money with you.Don't waste your time looking for the children's play area as it was less than exciting. Plus, my tall kid was too tall to even play there.The stadium was clean, the sun was shining and the game ended in a tie. Overall, a great family visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelerJenny8
40,The epitome of ballparks ... and LA's destructive auto addiction,"I am a baseball fanatic, and even more of a ballpark fanatic. So in all my summer travels to big cities, there's always a ballpark on the itinerary ... and at long last I was able last week to add to my list what many experts call the most perfect of all big league parks: Dodger Stadium. My verdict: It is, indeed, a great place to watch baseball. In particular, the park has been kept up to date - even at age 51 - without inundating fans in a suffocating environment of electronics-based incessant noise and lights. Also, what with so many ""retro"" parks around MLB these days, they're beginning to seem cookie-cutter. No such problem in LA's Chavez Ravine: If you were magically transported inside Dodger Stadium, you'd know instantly you could be nowhere but Dodger Stadium. The ballpark itself is worth the price of admission. HOWEVER ... it's outside the ballpark your experience turns negative. I've long known the park is engulfed in oceans of parking, but to see it first-hand ... to fight my way (on foot) through it ... hit me in the face with the horror that results from designing our human environments with nearly sole concern for the auto and people at most an afterthought. Too bad, because that's what's decisive in the overall experience of San Francisco's AT&T Park (as well as Chicago's Wrigley, Pittsburgh's PNC, Cincinnati's Great American, etc.) being better than that where the erstwhile Brooklyn Trolley Dodgers now play.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/desrlmt
40,"Great stadium, but prepare to walk!","Visited during spring break with kids 9 and 15. A nice stadium, but sections seemed separated between the upper and lower decks, so food options appeared limited (just burgers, fries, hot dogs), compared with some modern stadiums in other major cities (e.g., Citifield, Camden Yards).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danielh5
40,"Great ballpark, horrible traffic and parking","We had loge seats along the first base line, great views. The game was a lot of fun and the snacks aren't too overpriced (compared to say, a Yankees game). Unlike a few ballparks I've been too, Dodgers fans don't take themselves too seriously. Everyone was there to have a good time. There are plenty of snack counters and places just outside the park (but inside the gates) for the kids to run around if need be. Just be sure you get your snacks earlier in the game - they can run out of what you want!The only reason I couldn't give this a five rating is because of the traffic and parking situation. We left almost two hours early, yet only sat down at the beginning of the third inning! We were within sight of the parking gate about 15 minutes before the game's start time, yet it took that long for us to move the final 1000 feet to park the car. They could really benefit from a professional engineering analysis of the problem and solution. Ironic seeing that the team's owner made his fortune in developing and owning parking lots.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danielcE5289IE
50,Experience of a lifetime!!,"This was an awesome first time experience for myself and my teenaged son! Here's a couple of tips that I would like to share:Get your tickets from Barry's Tickets located in the Luxe Center Hotel downtown LA! Not only are they friendly and helpful, they are able to sell the tickets at a better price than the stadium can! Also, with the purchase of your tickets it covers your bus fare that will get you to Union Station where you can ride the Dodgers Express for FREE to the stadium and back again!!When looking online for tickets, check to see if it is a game where FREE give aways will be, well, given away! Then go EARLY to ensure you get one!! My son and I each received a pullover replica of the Dodgers practice jerseys!! They are unbelievably awesome!!Beers were $13 USD for what looked like either 16 or 20 oz. Food is stadium priced so be sure to take extra cash with you!!Oh yeah, make sure you dress warmly as when the sun sets it does get cool even for us Canadians!! It was 64F which is 17C!!It was a fantastic experience and I woulddo it again in a heart beat!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pair-of-Pelicans
50,Dodgers game,"Took 25 British students (16-18yrs), they'd never seen a baseball game before but loved itIt rained... First time on this date in like 40 years... But we're used to that ;)Prices not too extortionate for an event either",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deanoooo1982
40,"Great stadium, good food, fun time","Getting to Dodger Stadium is not the greatest. There's a lot of traffic, and it seems a lot of driving rules are thrown out the window right when you're near the stadium, so be prepared for some annoying times.BUT...once you get there, everything changes. The stadium has charm, attitude, ambience, and a genuine baseball feel to it. The halls are lined with memorabilia, from jerseys to pictures of the Dodger greats.We ended up getting the Kettle One Baseline Club seats. Glad we did - the seats are very, very spacious with a table in front of you. There are even hooks under the table for purses or what not. The club seats come with table service, which include some all-you-can-eat choices, all you can drink non-alcoholic, and cash alcoholic menus. There is also an actual Baseline Club you can go to which has a larger buffet selection of all-you-can-eat stuff, including, yes, Dodger Dogs. You also get your own private bathrooms and a private bar for club ticket holders only.Overall, had a great time in the stadium and getting the Baseline Club seats was WELL worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mstrctrlprgm
50,A special place to see baseball,"A few tips for the 2015 season: pre pay for parking on line and save money. $20 parking opposed to $10 prepay. There are special lanes for pre paid parking and even a designated special gate for pre paid parking. I like the Sunset Blvd. entrance for getting to the Stadium and leaving the Stadium. As you enter through the Sunset Blvd. gate, you will want to park in the lot on your immediate left. Follow the road to the left and enter from the other side. If you can cross the lot and park near the exit, you will save a lot of time getting out. As you leave you can get to Sunset Blvd. and turn right and go down Sunset to all arts of the City or turn left on Sunset, turn right on Figueroa and follow the signs to the 110 freeway and onto other parts of the city via the freeway system.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ZumaDawg

50,Thrill of a lifetime.,"For a Dodger or baseball fan, this park is a must see. Yep, traffic in L.A. can be a bear. Leave for the park early. Make a day/evening of the event.Seating - There're are no bad seats.Food - Ballpark food, expensive but... what the heck. You must have a Dodger Dog!Fans - Yep, loud. Yep organ music. Not sure what folks expect, it is major league ball, not the ballet.In 1988, while working in NYC, I took the subway one Sunday morning out to Brooklyn. Got off at the Brooklyn Museum stop and walked over to Bedford Ave. My friends thought I had lost my mind, looking for Da Bums. Guess what, found them in LA. All of my night at Dodger Stadium was sheer joy, win or lose. Heck, thought I heard the Sym-Phony!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ley74
50,Beautiful location,"We were there too early in the season as they play pre season games elsewhere. We went to the store and the top deck. It is a beautiful park. Mountains in the background, Hollywood view, great view of down town LA. This is a good location for a view of the Hollywood sign. We would love to see a game there but they were in our city, San Antonio playing the day we were there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/5150leroy

50,Beautiful place to watch baseball,"Dodger Stadium is one of the real gems of Los Angeles. Arrive early for an evening game; you'll beat the traffic and settle into your seats to watch the sun set over the hills that surround the ballpark. Then just relax and enjoy looking at the field of red clay earth and natural green grass as the grounds keepers set up for the game. And the Dodgers? Well, sometimes they win and sometimes they disappoint. But though years have passed since they moved from Brooklyn to L.A., they still have the same things that they always had: great pitching, team spirit, and loyal fans.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/loraineh798
50,Great night...,"We went to the Dodgers Stadium as part of our Honeymoon and loved this evening, the game was on our first night in LA so was good to keep us awake. Having never seen a baseball game before I had no idea what was going on but the atmosphere was infectious.I would arrive a good few hours before the game as we arrive a little late (although before the first ball) so that you can have a walk around before the game.We got a taxi into the stadium and back to our hotel and I can't see how else you would get there as the stadium is in the middle of no where! As we were jet lagged we left a little early which according to the taxi driver was the best thing we did to miss the rush!This is an experience which I really enjoyed and would recommend to any one even if your not into sport!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tjr985
50,Clubhouse Tour was excellent,"Great tour guide who is very knowledgeable and entertaining. We got to see just about every part of the stadium and we were able to take great pictures. If you are a Dodgers fan, this is a must.Be careful with directions getting there, especially off-season. Roads were closed, ramps were closed and we had a tough time finding the right entrance to use.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PJSacchetta
50,Review of Stadium Tour - Very Good,"My family and I took a stadium tour on a Wednesday morning. We bought tickets for the tour through the Dodgers website ahead of time to ensure a spot on the tour. I'd recommend purchasing ahead as we had a sizable group for our tour.The tour was lead by a gentleman who is very knowledgeable about the stadium and Dodger history. We started at the top level, worked our way to the press box, visited a suite and eventually to the entrance to the Dodger Club House and into the dugout and on the field. It was a great experience!It can be a small adventure getting to the right entrance gate and then up to the top level where the tours meet, but the guard did explain how to get there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/redbird71
50,I Rode My Bike to the Dodger Stadium,"I rode the bike to the Dodger Stadium, Los Angeles, expecting to photograph an empty stadium and joined a queue of people lined up to go into the stadium, but it didn’t feel right.The stadium was packed with people in certain small areas of the stadium and the rest was empty!The baseball players were standing around idle then would spring into action when the helicopter approached.This policeman asked for my Extras Identification and when I could not produce it, asked me to leave the stadium. I asked him why, and he replied that I had busted my way into a film being produced by Director Billy Ray in his upcoming film “In Their Eyes”, featuring Nicole Kidman.I then left the stadium.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eumundiward
20,Closed?!,We drove up from Anaheim to check out the Stadium and cross it off our list to visit all the ballparks. Once we arrived every gate was closed off to the public with no notice on their website. Their site stated the stadium was open to the public that day yet we could not get to the stadium. Disappointed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KSo75
50,Fair,"Start off by saying , getting from the entrance of the property to the entrance of the tour was very confusing . Despite being about 45 degrees when we toured it on a colder January morning ( mind you I'm from MN) it was a decent tour. Was nice to see the history here and just such a massive stadium! Also it's nostalgic when you are in the parking lot realizing how many movies you seen have been filmed there (I.e. The first fast and furious)... All in all it was worth the time to tour it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wolves0991
10,HORRIBLE,"I was there to watch my team play LA. The noise level was unbelievable, constant organ playing or other horrible music! The traffic getting to the stadium was a nightmare. We arrived after the game started. Leaving the stadium was a scene too, ugh!The fans are obnoxious, most don't even watch the game as they are too busy on their cell phones. Oh, and DON'T wear a jersey from another team. We were harassed from the moment we stepped out of our car. I was very nervous leaving the game as so many LA fans were drunk, foul mouthed, and rude! Never again!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/businesstraveler155
50,Go Blue!,"Love Dodger's stadium. The internal logistics stink, and if you take a wrong turn, you will be walking for quite a while, but it's just such an awesome venue for a baseball game. I simply love this place. It's very much a home to me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Antrim8

50,"""Blue Heaven"" or ""Home of the Dodger Dog""","Dodger Stadium is the cleanest Ball Park that I have ever been to. This is not a ""Porta Park"" like some of the 40,000 seat facilities that are so common these days. Dodger Stadium is Big, and has Great Character. The tickets now start at about $14, and a family can see a game without skipping the mortgage. Don't forget about the ""Famous"" ""Dodger Dog's"". The Dodger Dog's are ""Grilled"", not Boiled. They are a ""Treat"", that can't be Beat. Get your tickets for the next Home Stand, and I will see you at the Game.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NorCalWillS

The seats could see great and there was a lot of activity going on inside and outside. There was a Kiss concert, and a volleyball game going on. There was a smaller rink where they had a kids game during the first period break. Now as for the concessions we bought some fries and someone bumped us and it fell, they did apologize but the guys saw this and made another batch for us right away. We lost 3-0 the Kings that is but still was awesome to see an outdoor hockey game in Los Angeles and great experience. Thank you Dodger Stadium Staff.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/la660

50,Great fun!,"Had an amazing time at our first ball game. Really authentic experience, the fans were a great crowd and the snacks were great too!The staff are very well organised - I recommend researching parking in advance if you have a car as you have save a few $s booking in advance, and the lot is a short walk (5 mins) from the stadium. It isn't very well signposted but there are plenty of friendly, uniformed officials to point you in the right direction.We weren't sure how good our tickets would be given they were around $25 each but our view was absolutely fine. We tried to pick seats with a good view of the home plate when we booked.Little tip - try to wear some Dodger merchandise / Dodger colours as almost everyone in the crowd had something on, it did help us to fit in better and get involved!Must-do experience in LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/978jasmineb

From the moment we entered the stadium (fast-moving queues for snacks & souvenirs, along with the free gift that day of a Snuggie blanket to each person!) to the end of the game, everything was wonderful.

Such a shame that the Dodgers couldn't get to the WS final (probably couldn't have afforded a ticket anyway if they did!)But this tour was amazing, went round everywhere and anywhere (besides the home players lounge, slightly annoying but oh well). Spectacular views everywhere in that stadium, and the tour guides are quite possibly the most informative people you could ever know!The shop has a great range of gifts, collectables and jerseys. We were a bit eager and got our jerseys a few days before at City Walk (you a discount if you're on a stadium tour in the shop!)Fully recommend it, even if you're not a sports fan, you get some unreal views of LA from that stadium, awesome awesome place!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nawilliamson89
50,Blue Heaven On Earth,"My favorite spot on earth. I have visited LA a half dozen times in the past 3 years expressly to attend games at Dodger Stadium, This review is based from a tourist perspective. First, getting to the stadium can be a real chore. I have stayed at several different hotels in various parts of the city. The most convenient is the super 8 right on the corner of Sunset and Elysian Park. You can walk to the ballpark from there. Downside is that it is not the best neighborhood for restaurants and other things to do. If you stay in a hotel further away, stay north of downtown. Getting to Dodger Stadium from south of downtown Los Angeles is horrid due to traffic issues. It is almost a must to avoid the 110 freeway if you possibly can. Hollywood, Pasadena, Eagle Rock are all very good choices. Parking is also a hassle. My recommendation is to drive to Union Station and park there, then take the Dodger Express bus to the stadium. If you must park at Dodger Stadium get there early. Getting out of the parking lot after the game is also not easy.My personal favorite spot to sit is in the Loge section on the third base side. You get a really great view of the ballpark and mostly avoid the fans who may be rooting for the other team. Conversely, if you are rooting for the visiting team, then sit in the loge on the first base side.If you are able, try to get in a tour of the stadium while you are there. It costs 15 dollars and you get to see all the different areas of the park. You even get to visit the Dodger dugout. A must if you are a Dodger fan.Get at least one Dodger dog. The big pretzels and Nachos are good choices too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/872charlesh
50,went for 1 game,loved it. well worth the money if you're not from the states its a great experience. Went to Fenway Park a few years ago and the people there were more friendly but this stadium seems more impressive,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CptChunderpants
20,Bland Stadium,"One of my bucket list items is to watch a game at all of the MLB parks. While each park has its own character and uniqueness, Dodger Stadium is somewhat bland. The view is not bad, but the stadium itself is a little run-down. Parking, traffic and access to the park are all unbearable. I know it's LA, but tickets to the game, food and merchandise were a little pricey with the exception of the $1 Dodger Dogs. To the best of my knowledge, however, the $1 pricing is for the outfield section alone, which has no access to the remainder of the stadium. Worth a visit if it is part of your bucket list or you are an avid Dodgers fan (as my Grandfather was), but if you are just visiting LA, there are probably other more interesting attractions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/UFTraveler507
20,Take me out to the ballgame,"It is fun to watch the Dodgers play at their home stadium, but the stadium pales in comparison to other big league ball parks with respect to food choices, amenities and parking sucks.

30,Trying to be an Objective Angel fan,"The view of downtown L.A. is amazing. However the parking is extremely expensive and hard to access in and out of. Also, the concessions are extremely expensive. The stadium has been renovated and it has improved the experience a bit. Field box seats are fantastic and the fans are great if you're an Angel fan. However, if you're an Angel fan sitting in the reserved seats or bleachers, you'll be harassed throughout the whole game by extremely rude fans.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LASeoulGuy
50,Dodger stadium,Even though baseball season was over we still wanted to see the stadium during our visit to Los angeles. We drove up to the stadium and we given a pass by the stadium security to allow us to go visit the gift store and take pictures in the ball park. Thank you for that.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarolynP18
50,Great location for a 'ball game,Loved my first MLB game. I great location. Good visibility of the field of play. They certainly process the large volume of cars efficiently. Security were more than happy to direct us to the best gate. Loved it!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/346rossh
50,America's Pastime,"I'm a huge Dodger fan and I usually go to about 10 games per year. Obviously, if you are from America and aren't a Dodgers fan the only reason to go would be to complete the 30-stadium tour, or to see your home team play mine.However, if you aren't from America and want to get a taste of the American pastime while staying in Los Angeles, there is no better place than here!Be aware that parking and food can be pricey. You can park outside the stadium and walk in for free (instead of paying $15). There is also a shuttle from Union Station to the stadium. You are also allowed to bring in your own food, but soft drinks and alcohol must be purchased inside the stadium.If you want a less expensive experience with the food included I would recommend purchasing the ""All You Can Eat"" tickets in the Right Field Pavilion.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/402roys
50,First Game Ever,Went to see LA v Arizona and was my first game ever and loved it. Had free tickets due to a work do I was there for.Very easy to get to the stadium from downtown but I would have left a little earlier as we arrived as soon as the game started. Plenty to buy in the LA Dodgers store which was great. we caught a taxi after the game and for 50000 people who were there it was very easy to get one.I recommend any beer (MASSIVE CANS) and a hot dog.....so good.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dipper303m
40,Dodger Stadium Tour,"Tour guides were friendly and knowledgable. Enthusiastically presented history and features of Dodger Stadium. Tour presented in a logical manner. Used elevator to help limit stair climbing for guests. Visited press box, luxury suites, trophy halls, clubhouses and dugouts. Able to walk on field to take pictures (But not the grass!)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/palmfronds
30,OVER PRICED,"Watching the game with your boys is great, however, food, gifts and parking is over priced. They did decrease their parking by $5 as it used to be $15 (now $10) however, as far as you have to walk, it should be cheaper or offer trams like the theme parks (or offer something else???) How about some food deals, combos, etc., also.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kakj112000
40,Fun for the family,We wanted to watch a MBL game while we were in the US and bought tickets online before leaving Australia. We caught the subway and a free bus to Dodger Stadium and had a great night. The atmosphere is great with lots of crowd involvement. There are souvenirs and food available for purchase. Would certainly go again!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cladel20
40,It's Ball Time,"Went here when on a trip around California. Even though we don't support the Dodgers we wanted to see a traditional baseball game. We booked our tickets before going, what a steal at less then £15 for both of us!!! There's a free bus included in your ticket price to get you to the stadium, although we were unaware of this and thought it should have mentioned this on our ticket, luckily I asked someone for directions and they told us about this free bus otherwise we wouldn't have know. So make sure you check this out before departing as it is a decent bus service and avoids parking in the stadium.As you would expect food/drink prices are expensive but the this is what you would expect at an arena. They have novelty items like nachos served in a Dodgers helmet!! Also they give out free gifts, we got a free pair of headphones!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/478katyd
50,Think Blue,"I have been to Dodger Stadium a few times over the years, and it gets better with every visit, even though they lost on the last visit!!Getting to the stadium is easy and parking fine, getting in the security is fine, though be careful not to take any items not allowed in.Not knowing the game inside out, I know enough to understand and enjoy the game, plus the whole experience of Baseball is fantastic, crowd, atmosphere, Dodger dogs yum yum, and garlic cheese of chips(Fries) can't wait to go again.I have sat in all levels and views of the game are great, on my last visit being a Friday we stayed after the game for the fireworks show, and they let us onto the hallowed turf, amazing experience, Go Dodgers!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/idaho92
50,Lets go Dodgers let's go!!!,Took in the Padres game early September. Wanted to experience an American tradition and what an experience. Spent 5 hours in the stadium and it felt like 2 mins. Fans are very friendly and keen to help out a novice fan!! Met some great people including Mark the club historian who presented us with club gifts after finding out we were from Scotland. Now follow the team from afar but cant wait to go back!! Go blue!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/286donaldc
50,Our First Baseball Game,We were lucky to catch the Dodgers play against the Cardinals and we loved it. People were so friendly and nice. We had no clue about the game but by the time we left we were true fans as all the people around us took the the time to explain the rules of the game.Highly Recommended American Experience!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlobeXplora
50,Even if you don't bleed Dodger blue Chavez Ravine is a must see for all baseball fans.,"I grew up in the area and have always been a Dodger fan since the days of Willie Davis, Walt Alston to Tommy Lasorda and Ron Cey, Steve Garvey, Davey Lopes and crew to the Dodgers now.Besides being a lifelong Dodger fan, I have always thought of Dodger Stadium as one of the best baseball venues in baseball. On a beautiful summer night at Chavez Ravine the beautifully well kept stadium of over 50 years is still beautiful. From the brick infield to the downtown skylineif you're up in the upper decks. It is what baseball is all about, a warm night, the smell of hot dogs, beer and peanut shells on the floor is what makes watchinig a game live so much more enjoyable. Yes LA fans do like to leave early but we fill over 3 million seats a year so the getting out is harder than most places. To me it is a very aesthetically pleasing places to watch a game.Also, hearing Vin Scully on someone's radio is Dodger Baseball. There have been a few incidents of rowdiness but Dodgers Stadium is one of the nicest places to watch a game. The fans are not rowdy and the place is kept immaculate. And of course you have to get a Dodger dog and some peanuts. If your'e a baseball fan and have never gone to a game here, do yourself a favor and come to a game even if you root against us. The new owners have it right as opposed to the other owners who took over after the O'Malleys. Now it's Dodger baseball again and I am loving it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A9664MOdavidr
50,ENJOY BASEBALL AT DODGER STADIUM,"As a resident of Los Angeles and love baseball, come to Dodger Stadium to enjoy a game. The price is right; you can take the Metro-train to Union Station, get on the Dodger bus and have fun or leave your vehicle at Union Station and get on the Dodger bus. StubHub has the best price for tickets, lower than Dodgers.com. Food is a little expensive but the hot dogs are great. You have so many choices were to seat. Congratulations on the Dodgers winning the National League title in there division for the playoffs. GO DODGERS!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Traveler811908
50,What a stadium!!,"I have always wanted to see the dodger stadium and wow what a place. Compared to English football stadiums it is sooo much better. Everything you need is right there, 30 seconds walk to the bathroom, to get a drink, food or even merchandise. I happened to be there to see the perfect game (minus one error) and it was phenomenal.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/659garyd
30,On the fence,"Good environment, with great views. It starts off great when you first get into the dodger stadium. I mean who doesn't love that feeling of going to the ballgame. I was excited first time going to see the Dodgers at the infamous ball park. The first thing I did was grab a dodger dog and a drink. It's fairly priced for a ball park, considering I pay about 12 bucks CDN for a brew at the ol skydome (now known as the Rogers center). I payed about 10 bucks for both beer and dog. Then reality kicked in. It was over 100 degrees that day and I was sitting directly in the sun by first base. Luckily the people in front of me provided me and my sister with some sunscreen or else I would've been burnt crisp. On top of that the Dodgers gave up 8 runs in the first 3 innings. However I did get to meet Jessica alba! I left before the game could finish cause it was too hot for a Sunday mid day game. Traffic was good entering and leaving and I will go back but this time I think a post season visit at night would be a better time! Go Dodgers!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlessandroE2
50,Gobsmackingly big. Great atmosphere.,"I went with a group of 4 other 21 year old lads as we wanted to sample some American sport on our trip! Although not huge fans of the game of baseball itself, we had a fantastic time at Dodger stadium. We watched a night game as the LA Dodgers took on the Washington Nationals, and we were lucky to pick a night where they were doing a giveaway and we got a Magic Johnson bobblehead.One key bit of advice I would give is in regards to your ticket. If you are printing yours off at home as we did, make sure your printer is a good quality one that is able to clearly print the lines of a barcode. A lot of people had the same problem as us, with the people at the turnstiles not being able to scan our tickets, and therefore we had to go to the ticket office and we missed the start of the game.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JamesS262
40,Dodger Stadium,"Nice stadium. Although, among one of the older stadiums the Dodge Stadium has held up pretty well. I like our seats because they had short rows...if you were sitting the in middle only 3 or 4 people had to get to let you out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/475tracye
40,I was in town for business and decided at 3:00PM to go on the Wednesday of a sold out game which began at 7:00PM.,"I was in town for business and decided at 3:00PM to go on the Wednesday of a sold out game which began at 7:00PM and here is my experience.Overall, a great MLB experience especially when the Dodgers are winning.About buying tickets.There is advice for ticket buying and parking on several sites and blogs as well as Trip Advisor and there was a collection of good advice.The Dodger website was either out of tickets or wouldn’t sell one online a few hours before the game. StubHub had about 1,000 tickets so I bought one online, no problem. One can print the ticket OR if you receive it via your cell phone, the mobile ticket line is a bit shorter than the paper ticket line but this is an inconsequential advantage.About the seats.I like the third base side, between third and home. The only seats available were the Top Deck section which is the highest section of seats. However, the view was great. See the picture from the Top Deck. My seat was in section 13, Row C. The steps are steep and a bit intimidating going down but once seated, the view is fine. I would do this again.About the food.There was the typical concession stand nearby. There are a number of specialty foods available but one must change stadium levels to get these specialty items. For me, a Dodger Dog and a beer were fine.About the stadium.Third oldest in MLB, largest in size (56,000 plus), beautiful setting, well maintained but no elevators and precious few escalators. This wasn’t a problem but it is an uphill walk from your car to your seat.About parking.Learned one can park on the side of the stadium where your ticket is located. From the web site one can figure out which side to park but getting to the correct side was confusing for me. However, I used this business as an address for the GPS and it took me right where I needed to be. Elysian Therapeutic Recreation Center, 929 Academy Rd, Los Angeles, CA 90012. There’s much talk on the websites about parking and paying for parking in advance. StubHub seemingly wouldn’t let me buy one parking pass and would only sell me two. I determined to not do that and arrived about 30 minutes before game time. I parked in General Parking, $15.00, entering off of Academy. Next time I would try to pay $10.00 on line for general parking. When I was on Academy, I couldn’t tell where the parking entrance was but if I had followed the flow of the cars, it would have found it. Once parked, the walk was not a problem. But remember where your car is parked.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Arizonapopi1
50,"So, so big !","We planned to visit the stadium to watch the local derby vs San Francisco Giants having been to Wrigley Field the previous night. What a difference ! The sheer size of the place for one, with parking as far as the eye can see.....The impact when you first see the inside of the Stadium is breathtaking - and every seat has a great view. The numbers attending is huge and the staff are so, so friendly and accommodating. They manage the crowds so politely but efficiently.The facilities are modern and clean, the concessions are a little expensive, but this is LA. I still think $13 for a can of beer is steep.One tip ...... Get out of the car park as soon as you can after the game or you will need a lot of patience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Richchap24
30,Nice Stadium,"Dodger Stadium is a nice place to see a ball game. The team is good so the fans are into it. Accessing the stadium via public transportation is the way to go because I would imagine driving is an expensive nightmare. Walking to the stadium is not an option and I learned that the hard way. There are no pedestrian paths leading up the mountain that it is perched on.Other than that, the stadium itself is very clean and has a ""baseball feel"" to it. Only complaints are that sections and seating in some areas is not clearing marked and concessions are crazy expensive (and I go to sporting events in Chicago)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/778franki
30,Great place to spend July 4th,I went to the Dodgers game on July 4th two years in a row (2012 & 2013) - great place to catch some fireworks without having to leave your seat!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JC_454
50,Love going to Dodger games!,"Anytime I'm in California and the Dodgers are playing....I'm there. It's clean, great fun, amazing food...including Dodger Dogs!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JaimeK716
40,It's on a fricken mountain.,"We always have to go to a ball game when we travel, so we took in the Dodgers playing the Diamondbacks. We walked to the game from dinner, and we were the only ones (for good reason). The stadium is difficult (but not impossible) to reach on foot. I would recommend using public transportation to Union Station, then hopping on the free shuttle that takes you to the stadium (your ticket counts as your fare, otherwise it's cheap, around $1.50 I think). It was a good game and our seats were decent. It lost a bit in the review because we found it very difficult to find our way around. We attend many sporting events so we're used to finding our way around arenas and ballparks and this one just seemed more confusing than most.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Spammie22
50,Excellent Tour,"Ralph took us on the tour with about 16 other people. He knows his stuff and the tour was super inclusive. Got to see the press box, suites, changing rooms, trophy room and all the facilities. Well worth the price of the ticket. A highlight of LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/badm00nr
50,Great night out even if you do not know baseball,We had friends take us to the game. Dodgers lost but what an experience crowd was well mannered with both sets of fans inter mixed. The night we were there there was a fireworks display great show. In the USA you need to go to a baseball game.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lbwno
40,gotta try it once,"took in a game with the Mets on a Sunday. First time to Dodger Stadium and it was great. It is one of the older stadiums in MLB but has its charm. Dodgers dogs and a beer are a must. The dog was good and the beer ice cold. Parking was 15 bucks but worth it. It is in a nice area and is worth the trip from Disneyland which is where we were set up. About a 40 minute drive that day. We took two young kids which was ok but boring for them once the food and goodies ran out. Still, if you are a Dodger fan you have to go here once at least. We saw some people having nachos in a baseball helmet which looked big enough to feed two or three people. They seemed to love it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SonnyBoyz
50,First time visit for lifelong fan,"Visiting Dodger stadium was a dream come true for our lifelong Dodgers fan who had never been to the stadium or the city of LA. What a thrill it was. The fact that the ballpark is still going strong for the many years of the franchise's tenure in LA, and still looks fantastic says a lot about the pride of the loyal base of Dodger fans. I liked the fact that its design reflected the land on which it sits, and that it has a unique Southern California feel - for a stadium should belong to its fans and their city in every way. My Dodger Dog was quite tasty. There weren't too many food hawkers in the seats, unlike most of the major league parks I have been in, so one did have to get up to get food. Not a big deal for us, but might be an issue for others. We were there for Friday night fireworks too, and the opportunity for fans to walk on the field for the fireworks was unbelievable to me. What a great show and sheer pleasure to watch the children dance on the field to the music being played! Paying for reserved parking was an extremely good idea, and getting there early and leaving as late as possible really helped us get out of the parking lot without any hassles. The real star though was the team and the game -- for we watched a great and storied franchise defend the top of their division -- while being part of a memorable night for a lifelong fan that had the time of his life.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dancinggirl2014
40,CA ballparks trip,"We did a ballpark trip with another family of die-hard basball fans and started with Dodger Stadium. I was very impressed with how clean, bright and fun the stadium was. It was pretty retro, which I love. My friend has MS so we had accessible seating. We had bought a parking pass and along with her handicap parking tag, the crew directed us to a spot right outside where our seats were. She scootered in with ease, to find our seats were right there! no elevator needed. They nailed it. The other dad was a bit disenchanted with the fans, saying they had no interest in the actual game. Either way I thought it was a great experience. Beautiful backdrop of the palm trees, mountains, etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M_Sear
50,Watching the Dodger,"Great place to watch a good Dodger's game!hotdog and beer and all different kinds of drinks were great plus most of the brand new restaurant that opened up were different being a ballpark that it is.Overall Magic did a great thing changing the Stadium around, OH yea lot of security!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Forture-950
30,"Friendly fans, nice older ballpark, leaving is a nightmare","As a die-hard Mets fan, I was thrilled that they were in town the same time I was, playing the Dodgers on the weekend! Went on a Friday night, which also was fireworks night!We got there at around 5 for a 7:10 game, so driving into there was no problem. My mom and I were wearing our Mets attire, so we expected dirty looks and people saying things to us off the bat, since usually when you visit another ballpark that's what you get. But actually, Dodger fans are really nice! The people in our section joked with us the whole game, especially when I was loud cheering for the Mets, but of course the Mets lost so in the end they were cheering louder.There are a LOT of stairs and steps in this stadium, obviously because it's one of the older ones. If you can't do stairs, it's a tough one.Prices of good and drinks were the standard pricey fare (about 10 for a beer, 5 for a water bottle, etc). I was surprised that not that many vendors came around out section (we were field level on the third base side). Had to leave my seat to get a beer and if I wanted something other than ice cream or cotton candy, which was weird. Didn't try a Dodger dog, I'm not a fan of hot dogs, but I did see a huge helmet bowl of nachos I would have loved to try, but couldn't find a stand selling it anywhere close to my seats, which was disappointing.I loved the postgame fireworks show, and was amazed that they let fans on the field for it!!!Overall we had a really fun night at a different ballpark, it can use some upgrades, especially escalators, but otherwise a really fun time. And they NEED to do something about leaving the parking lot. It took us about 20 minutes just to leave our spot, probably a total of 45 minutes to get out of the lot. I know traffic was bad in LA but I would never expect the worst of it was leaving a ballpark.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/toniann1518
50,A Classic!,"Loved the old classic feel and charm of Dodger Stadium! The food was the typical baseball food and they do it well. The dodger dog was great, was the longer dog hanging off the ends of the bun. Farmer John did good! Loved the scoreboards/screens being not the typical rectangle shape and having the diamond flair. The views are fantastic and access is easy. A great experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annopinion
40,Great experience,"When you visit America, it is worth it to visit a baseball game. The dodgers game on friday includes a free fireworks show after the game!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/simonew147
40,"Dodger Stadium Tour- good experience, a bit pricey","Our tour guide, Mark, did a great job with the tour. The Dodgers were out of town and we went on the earliest 10:00 a.m. tour so there were only 10 in our group. That would be the first recommendation-go early. As mentioned in other reviews the tour included the press level, guest suites, trophy hall, dugouts, visitor clubhouse (the old one since the new visitor clubhouse opened this year and was not accessible). You were able to step onto the dirt warning track surrounding the field. The hall of trophies and awards was particularly impressive. There were photos and exhibits of equipment and uniforms scattered throughout the 90 minute walk. You were able to walk through the Lexus dugout club. All in all a good time although I thought $20 was a little pricey. Recommendation: When you go to the website to book and print your ticket, it informs you which parking lot to park in. It does not tell you which gate to access the stadium. All the gates are closed except for GATE A- Sunset. It would have been nice to include that information on the website saving people the hassle of driving around Dodger stadium looking for the correct gate to access. Furthermore, the guard would not let anyone on the property until 9:30 a.m. - we arrived a little earlier than that and ended up sitting in our car outside the gate until that time. Another item they could have included on their website. I toured AT&T park in San Francisco and the tour was very similar.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/apacheap
50,25 Yrs Later,"Why I waited so long to return to Dodger Stadium is a mystery to me! I went on a group chartered bus LD Tour Bus our driver Fred was AWESOME! It was such a great deal, so I bought tickets for me, my sister & our 2 adult sons! Our seats were in the All-you-can-eat Pavilion which was an added bonus! The moment we walked into the stadium all the staff we encountered were so cool, smiles & happiness was exuding every where! I went into the store and bought visors for us, it's a little pricey but hey it was a treat for us coming from Las Vegas! The food & drinks were so organized & very generous, they also had water dispensers all around! It was such a great time & I will never forget the memories we made! Now, I will make it a point to go at least once a year to see the Dodgers, I grew up in S. CA so I have been a Dodgers fan my whole life♥ Great family trip can't wait to return!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aztecrose06
40,Let's Go Dodgers!,"Despite the high prices for food (though the nachos taste lovely and the Dodger dog looks pretty good too), a great night is to be had here. After seeing a Cubs game last year, I can safely say there is far more atmosphere here. Being a foreign tourist I didn't know the words to 'Take Me Out to the Ballgame', but this hardly mattered as it was all in good spirit. Even though the Dodgers lost, the fans kept their cool. It was brilliant that after the game we were invited to sit on the field and watch a film on the big screen, definitely an experience.Visited August 2014",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StephSeesTheWorld
30,Nice ballpark but pales in comparison to the modern parks,"Don't get me wrong, it's a nice park, lot of history and some nice food choices and quality - friendly staff as well - however, compared to the amenities and lists of additional items offered by the more modern parks dating back as far as Camden Yards, it's a nice place to see a game but it's definitely in the bottom half of parks - will say there are good ticket price opportunities for families",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scdeleon
50,Classic Stadium Gets More Beautiful Every Year,"Hard to believe Dodger Stadium is the third oldest baseball stadium in America, newer than only Wrigley Field and Fenway Park. New ownership has spent a ton of money in much needed upgrades, and it's made this gem a perfect combination of old and new. Signs and reminders everywhere inside the stadium of its history, yet at the same time it has all of today's modern conveniences. Wide concourses, the best video screens in MLB, great food and drink selections, etc. The lower level seats are fantastic (Loge level is my favorite), but even upper level seats are good. When in the Resered level, you get spectacular views of the beautiful hills and mountains that are behind the outfiled fences. Dodger fans are highly knowledgeable and the large fan base really gets into the games. Overall, a Dodger Stadium is a GREAT experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SteveR286
50,Dodgers won!,"The Wife and I decided to catch a Dodger game just the two of us and are never disappointed! There is security everywhere and you feel safe from the moment you drive through the gates, to the moment you drive out!

50,An Englishman in LA,If you are an Englishman in LA an you want to experience a little bit of US culture go to a Dodgers game. It was for us great fun. As a cricket fan it's a bit like a twenty-twenty game lasting around three hours and that three hours is action packed. Before we went to game we thought it would be a rather like a boring Rounders game. This couldn't have been further from the truth. The atmosphere in the stadium was amazing and just seeing Americans enjoying themselves was an education in itself. As for the game the Dodgers are a great team and we will be following their progress in the future. We have become fans!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Worthmoretravel
50,Excellent experience!,"A great experience! Even though the stadium is old, it was fabulous to be at a place with so much baseball history. Everyone was very friendly - we told them it was our first time to Dodger Stadium and they made us feel very welcome. Parking was very easy in and out with helpful guides and attendants. Buying tickets with the delightful lady at the ticket booth was fun and then we had a great time shopping in the team store to get some Dodger gear. Ushers were very helpful in the stadium. Just a great experience for the whole family - we all wore our Dodger gear home to Canada the next day! They should be very proud of all their staff!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lew44
50,Vin Scully and Growing up as a Dodger Fan,"Although Dodger stadium gets older each and every day, it is one of the great ball parks in baseball history.I have been to a Dodger game so many times I cannot even count how often. My mom used to get tickets through her work - every time they could not find someone to go on the season ticket plan for the company, they knew my mom loved the Dodgers - my dad did too. And they had 3 tickets. We went off to the baseball game. We had the best seat - right behind home plate. We bought a Dodger dog and some peanuts. And Dodgers have the best peanut salesmen - they used to have a guy that you would watch sell peanuts instead of the game as he was so entertaining.Then there is Vin Scully - even though I do not live in LA now every time I hear his voice it thrills me. He is THE voice of baseball. He has had an amazing win streak. We would listen to the baseball game every day they were playing. We would even try to listen to the game from the Eastern Sierras even though at the time I was growing up the signal was weak.And as such, even though I root for the A's and Giants now, my heart will always belong with the Los Angeles Dodgers. When I was growing up Jim Murray was a writer to the LA Times and he would write the best baseball columns. Now, I read about them on the web.We go to Dodger stadium not as often as before now as we live away, but when I find myself in LA we go to the game. The prices of beer, hot dogs, etc. are much higher now - but the thrill of seeing a game in Los Angeles is one of the things I really like..This is a classic stadium - and if visiting the LA area and interested in baseball do go, like we just did. And the good news is that Vin Scully has just signed up for one more year to announce the games -although now he is in his mid 80s.We usually enter the parking area at the Dodger stadium by taking the 5, existing and driving up through Griffith Park area. And unlike some LA Dodger fans where they leave in the 7th inning, we always stay till the bitter end. The latest time being a couple of weeks ago.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mini
50,A great experience,"We aren't baseball fans but wanted to experience this slice of American culture. From start to finish it was an amazingly positive night. Parking was very easy with plenty of helpful guides and ample spaces. Almost every parking attendant, greeter, staff person that we saw on the way in welcomed us like old friends. It was the same leaving after the game.The stadium may be old but it's a comfy old, not dirty. Plenty of food stands and restrooms. Crowd involvement in the game was great. The food was a little pricey but you get that at most stadiums.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoeR680
50,It's still Beautiful.,"Although Dodger Stadium is now over fifty years old, it is still a beautiful ballpark. There is plenty of parking and the staff is very pleasant. If you are a baseball fan, then going to a Dodger Game at Dodger Stadium is a must.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/waynes464
50,A wowing experience!,"Our company had an event at the Top park of Dodger stadium when the team was out of town. We had guided tours of the bowels of the stadium with all the memorabilia of retired jerseys and world series championship rings and trophies. It was an aweing experience. To top it all off, Vin Scully was our guest speaker. What a remarkable man. He has been the Dodge announcer for 68 years!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shooties
40,This is what baseball is about,"Not many classic stadiums left. Very unique as it feels of a baseball game from yesteryear. Mainly because of the architecture, layout, and acoustics (the roar of the crowd seems to echo and engulf). If in LA, going to a Dodger game is a MUST. Dodger dogs aren't that great but the $15 big bottles of microbeer are great. Nice view of the LA downtown from the parking lot too! Get their early as traffic is brutal. Fridays are fireworks night where you can go on the field to watch (what a treat)!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ericraheem
40,Great Stadium,I was very happy to finally be able to take in a Dodger game at Dodger Stadium. I have been to many Stadiums but I have always wanted to get a Dodger Dog while watching a game in the stadium. A few months ago a very good friend made that happen for me. I felt like a little boy. Surrounded by dedicated fans great ballpark food and camaraderie. For as old as the stadium is I was amazed what great shape it was in. Parking was some of the easiest I have encountered for a big venue. I hope to take my boys soon so they can experience what i did.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Foodnando
50,Will be back!,"Wow! I am so impressed with this stadium and how it is run! I guess I will first start with the parking (which is normally a nightmare at other event areas). The traffic directors were all very courteous and made us feel welcome right from the start!Then we entered the stadium....the greeters were the exact same. All friendly! Couldn't count the number of times I heard ""Thank you for coming! Welcome to Dodger stadium"". Made me feel more like family, than a fan.The thing I was most impressed with was the security measures. From the training rookies in blue, to the LAPD, to the stadium security team. I felt safe and secure.I just have to say this in reference to the armed LAPD...these cops ALL looked professional, clean, and on their game! Kudos to whoever oversees their dress code and conduct! They looked awesome. (Nothing I hate worse than seeing a sloppy cop lol) good job guys!The food at the stadium is quite pricy, but thats to be expected. $13-15 bucks for a beer, so be ready to pay up.Also, another big pro for this venue...restrooms are literally everywhere! I really liked that. Nice not to have to wait forever in line and have to hunt for a restroom.My only con...the guy selling churros ran out and never came back in the 6th inning lol....guess I didn't need that sugar anyways! ;)I most definitely will be back! Love, love, love!Keep up the good work!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ashbeck77
40,Classic early 60's stadium,"Okay so my first time here was for Paul McCartney's return in August to a stadium he was last at in 1966 with the Beatles. There have certainly been some improvements. Larger food isles on most levels, new seats, although i hate the leaning cup holders this style of seats have, not the only coliseum i've seen them in. Because of the leaning if you have someone next to you with a drink without a top on it, i've seen lots of spillage of the drink when it's still fairly full. Also, it is true what some say that because of all the levels navigating your way through the facility to find where you came in and how to get back there can be a challenge for those new to the facility. All of that being said, loved the classic feel, was fairly comfortable, the fans were generally great, and it was a great time at a great show not hindered by the facility which was just fine for the function, again, it is a lot of walking to get to your seat though. Hope the place is around a long long time, was such a shame to see we are losing Candlestick Park in San Francisco. : o ( Oh, and don't expect great deals at the concession stands, they are outrageously priced as they are at all such facilities, which still doesn't make it okay.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/northernk
50,Loved it!,"We booked to see a Thursday night game against the Braves. We were unsure about the dodger shuttle from union station due to some reviews on here but need not have worried. We got the bus at 5.30pm, there were about 5 or 6 buses in line ready to take everyone. It was free as we had tickets and it was really quick to get to the park, dropping us off right outside the entrance gate. There were staff on hand as we stepped off the bus to direct us. Everything was really organised and well run.We had purchased the all you can eat pavillion tickets and were not disappointed! These are great value for money at only $45 each. We had our own entry area which was cordoned off just for the all you can eat tickets. It was amazing, so much food! Everything was really well organised, you line up and take your pick, as much as you want, and can go back as many times as you wish too. They had peanuts, popcorn, nachos & cheese sauce, hotdogs and soft drinks. It wasn't brilliant food but great for all you can eat, what else do you expect? There was a bar to get alcohol but this was more pricey, as expected though.We sat in our stand with all the other all you can eat ticket holders and there was a brilliant atmosphere, surrounded by true dodger fans. They were able to have a rapport with the dodger players on the pitch as we were so close and a few balls came our way!We left at the start of the 9th inning to miss the traffic and were on a bus and back to union station within half an hour, no traffic, no problem. It was mine and my girlfriends first baseball game and they now have 2 new dodger fans!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mlawrence22
30,It helped it was a playoff game,"Ok…so we went to the NLCS game. We have been to many ball parks, but I have to say this is THE MOST confusing to get in and out of. Traffic, like anywhere in LA is AWFUL, so leave early to get to the game.Once you are in the ballpark, it is super confusing where to get to your seats. We ended up walking down some backwards stairs, and somehow found our seats.It is old, but didn't feel rundown. The fans were very friendly, and it doesn't hurt there was great baseball happening on the field! We ended up leaving early because we had no idea if we were going to find our car or a way out of the parking lot!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrendaS637
50,The Tour is Amazing,"My family was visiting from the East coast and we decided to take the tour of Dodger Stadium. The tour begins on the top level of this historic ballpark with sweeping views of Chavez Ravine, downtown LA and the Hollywood sign. The tour guide was very knowledgeable and gave so many interesting historical facts about the stadium and the people who have played there. We visited the Vin Scully Press Box, a luxury box, saw Frank Sinatra's former seat and the hall of Gold Gloves and World Series trophies. We were allowed to go on the edge of the field and get a picture and we went in the team dugout and had a photographer capture the moment for us. What a really fun day seeing a side of Dodger Stadium not many people get to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/debbbiew
40,History but Run Down,Great ballpark for history and being one of the older ballparks in the league worth going and seeing. But just felt rundown and out of date.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/489michaeli
50,Great Place to See a Ball Game,"Visited this iconic ballpark with my wife and 15 year old son and had a GREAT time .The atmosphere of this venue is just wonderful. The fans a staff are really friendly. Had a Dodger dog as well as a Brooklyn Dodger dog. Since there is little public transit to the stadium driving by car seems to be the most popular way to get there. Getting in not so bad ( $15.00 to park) but, leaving took me well over 1 hour to get out of the parking lot. ( It was a crowd of over 50,000 ). It was a promotional giveaway night and travel mugs were to be given out but they had a problem with the delivery, so none were available, only in the days after the game. I was only visiting LA for a week and was leaving the next day. (I'm from Montreal). I told this to one of the stadium staff and they told me to see fan services where I explained to them the situation. They then said that they could mail me the travel mug to my residence in Canada, which I thought was quiet nice, That was wonderful customer relations!! Once again great experience and a great old style stadium. A must in LA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bjg57
50,When in Rome and all that......,"Booked the Dodger Stadium Tour as the end to our holiday in the U.S and although we can't say we are the biggest baseball fans...atleast we now know something about the Dodgers and Baseball history!!The tour for $20 lasted around 90 mins,a little bummed that we couldn't get in the dug out but they were setting up for Paul Mc Cartney gig!!! We did get to see quite abit though so swings and roundabouts!!!We had hoped that atleast one of the food stalls would be open so we could taste the Dodger Dog, but alas not....( disappointed sigh )!!! Tho $ 13 for a beer during the game would make my purse scream!!Anyway, it was a great way of spending a couple of hours and luckily for us the clouds cleared by 11am so the pics came out really well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cazza32
50,Great experience - did the pre- game tour!,"First visit to Dodger stadium- great 1960's style stadium. Saw Dodgers vs. Angels, first game of the ""freeway series"". Enjoyed a pre-game tour of the stadium which we booked in advance on the internet. Seats in section 33 were good and staff and fans alike were very friendly and helpful. We taxied to and from our downtown hotel with no problems.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gailm_11
50,"Location, location, location","Dodger Stadium was a lot of fun, and pretty much the total opposite of Fenway, the other park I know. Getting there on game day took longer than planned (it was a sold-out game against the Giants), but crowd control was excellent and the fans surrounding us (in the nosebleed seats) were all about the Dodger-love. Stadium food was stadium food with a California twist. Mostly I loved the venue, in the bowl of the hills, with the city feeling like it was miles away instead of over the other side. It's a great place for baseball.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kathy_Quimby
30,Not so fan friendly,"When we attended a recent night game against the Angels, the stadium staff from ushers to concession to security were all pleasant and helpful. The park is old, circa 1960s, and some fans will cite the lack of entertainment that lots of the newer parks offer, but that's not the basis for my review. I have two points to make about getting autographs and public transport to/from the games.My 10 year old son was sorely disappointed that the team cards were out of stock at the gift shop. We arrived at the park when it opened so he could purchase them and get autographs before the game. Nobody at the counter seemed to care that the cards were out of stock. No matter because my son was not allowed to get to the wall or behind dugout to get autographs. Only ticket holders for the expensive seats in the lower section were allowed in the lower area near the players. We've been to a handful of parks across the country and never seen anything like that. Most parks will allow fans, which end up being lots of kids, to get autographs and then closer to game time they steer fans back to their sections where their seats are located.FREE SHUTTLE & WALKING TO STADIUMThe walk to the stadium from the bus stop is a good mile uphill the entire way. The city offers a free shuttle to ticket holders the day of the game and it drops you off in front of stadium before the game. Sounds good. However, after the game the shuttles are stuck in the same traffic lane as all the other fans in cars trying to leave the park. The management needs to provide a lane for shuttles and taxis to move things along better for fans who chose not to or can't drive to the game. Fans on the shuttle are most likely catching a train at union station. For night games when the game gets out after 10pm, the train and bus schedule becomes limited, they don't run as often.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/207RoM
50,Dodger Blue!,"First time at Dodgers Stadium on a Friday night. Parking was crowded, but we DID get there last minute. Navigation was easy and staff were super helpful. Beer and blue margaritas were good… great atmosphere, you couldn't help BUT be excited. Fireworks at the end were pretty great. Can't wait to go back =)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Beatrice_RN
40,Fun game!,This is an old stadium but lots of fun with a group! The dodgers won the night we went and we got bobble heads as well! Great views to enjoy the game and amazing garlic fries! They need to get more up to date with variety of food like some of the stadiums on the east coast! A lot of uphill walking from parking to the actual stadium as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Luv2Travelw2boys
50,Artful Dodgers Made it a Night to Remember,"This was by some margin our most memorable event during the LA leg of our holiday. We were a few rows from David Beckham and had the buzz of having ourselves projected onto the big screen, the cameraman taking a shine to my daughter Ellie who was sporting a lovely shade of blue hair - by coincidence the team colours.It was a typically unpredicatable game that looked like a family fun feature but turned into a real thriller when the Braves almost stole the show.Food was as you'd expect, the seats in Loge absolutely perfect and the atmosphere superb. If you want to immerse yourself in US culture - go to a ball game and if you're in LA you can do no better than take a trip to Dodgers Stadium.A final point on logistics, 50,000 fans departed without major hold ups, it took us a matter of a 20 minutes to get back to our base some 5 miles away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ThePoshFrog
50,Ode to a Phillies fan,"What can I say about a sports venue like Dodgers stadium that hasn't been said already? Well I enjoyed the new eateries ,the game wasn't great Phillies lost this one, my favorite part would be the dodger ambassadors. They were everywhere ,helping with directions,suggestions and allaround friendly attitude. I can't say enough about them but thank you. See you next year.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joeytd
30,Not impressed,"This stadium is older and seems small. The food was ok and most of the people we encountered were nice. However, the fans boo a lot! Even at each other!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/teachings4me
50,Great Stadium,"Was my first time at Dodgers Stadium. It is everything I thought it would be, great experience. Nothing but a sea of Dodger Blue, was very impressed. Fans were great, friendly, cheering, and lots of celebs in the stadium.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chubster_22
50,Cubs vs. Dodgers,"The fans at Dodger stadium, Cubbie and Dodger alike, were all super cool. The firework show at the end was awesome especially since they let the fans get on the field. It was a great experience and so happy to cross that off the list. Our seats were right behind Cubbie dugout so you might get a different experience in the low budget section...lol",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zavalan
50,Wonderful evening Out With Family,"We waited late to book tickets, but we had excellent seats. Children under 4 can get in free. We booked tickets and parking online. The operation runs so smoothly that you are in and out of the ball park in a few minutes. You can take your own water into the game. Food and drink was quite expensive. We ate at a restaurant before the game to cut down on the expense of the outing. It was a fun experience with an infant with us.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Winetastindiva
50,Section 28,"We were lucky enough to be in town while Clayton Kershaw was pitching, so our experience gets 5 stars right off the bat.Aside from that, Dodger Stadium is a true treat for any baseball fan. Lots of history and tradition and an easy view of Vin Scully in the broadcast booth.We got tickets in the first row of section 28 for a pretty decent price. For those not willing to pay the much higher prices to be down low, the early rows of the upper sections offer great views.The stadium is showing its age a little bit and the parking wasn't the most intuitive process in the world, but no actual complaints. Parking tip: you can pre-purchase parking on the Dodgers website, and it's actually cheaper there than if you pay at the gate. Figure out what gate you'll be entering at and get parking close to that, and the experience will be a breeze.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/districttraveler11
50,Dodgers Game in the Summer,"We got field level seats behind third base. Everything is clean an updated. The staff is so friendly. It was a hot day and the usher was making sure everyone was ok & drinking water. The promotion was a kids backpack, we now have a backpack for the school year! The best part was the thunder bats for $1.50, it kept the kids busy throughout the game.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SuzysVista
30,Bait and switch,Came in from out of town and bought nose bleeds. I ordered what I thought were actual seats but they were standing room only. This was not made clear at all when I made my purchase. Sad because my 14 year old son had been very excited to go. Instead we had to stand and see barely any of game. My advice is to read that fine print!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Smbandjb
40,MLB Dinosaur!,"A true must see for baseball fans. The seats were large and comfy, food was OK with much of it prepared well in advance of the game. We would have liked to see some healthy choices to go along with the standard ballpark junk food. There needs to be more bathrooms, existing ones have been updated nicely. Parking is not bad, but what can i say about LA traffic. So get up and take you and your family out to the ballgame!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dcsteve56
40,"Not a Dodger fan, but enjoyed the experience","Got tickets online for the front row of the ""all you can eat"" pavilion. Would get end of row seats next time. Food was quick and easy to get too. People around were polite, fans and security. Caught a home run ball for my 10 year old. Parking was easy in and out. Don't get lost in surrounding neighborhood, kind of scary late at night, if you know what I mean!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DaHodges
40,The All American Experience,"If you like your beer, hotdogs, fries with garlic and sports matches that last at least 4 hours then this place is definitely worth a visit. Ticket stub is a really useful to get tickets from which can be downloaded onto a sabb very simply.Parking is very easy and there are thousands of spaces to pick. There are loads of easily accessible toilets/bars/food outlets to pick and choose from. The atmosphere of the games are pretty good and the crowd does really make up for the game which can be slow at times.When you are buying tickets make sure you choose something between the 'infield' sections between 1, 2nd or 3rd base. Well worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/matttennant2019
50,Great atmosphere,"We are not from LA or Dodger fans, but we had a great time. We have been to several MLB parks and felt this one is very family oriented. We had seats in the upper level, and while it took us a little bit to figure out where to go all the employees were very friendly and helpful in getting us to our section. We loved the views. Prices on food were pretty good compared to some other parks we had been to.If you drive I recommend getting there very early just so you have less traffic to deal with. We got there about 15 minutes after the gates to the stadium opened (a 45 minutes after the parking lots opened) and had not trouble getting in or parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RebeccaA108
50,Really American experience,"Never been before so I'm not a fan, but great experience. Really fun environment, hotdogs, beers, garlic chips (these are lethal!) and lots of singing chanting and crowd watching which I found entertaining.Bit of a pain getting out if you are getting a cab and public transport is non existent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jamez1981
50,"Bicycle Friendly, bike to game, save money","My wife and I decided to bicycle to Dodger Stadium for a bit of an adventure through downtown L.A. There seem to be five bicycle racks situated on the left and right entrances to the Loge and Reserved seating sections and one rack near the upper deck parking lot. Their map shows some racks outside the left and right field pavilions, but we did not see them. If you bike in, there is no parking charge, so you park for free and the racks are right outside the entrances. Of course, you need to be real careful with all the cars there, but we negotiated our way quite easily and had no problems.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ZumaDawg
50,Think blue!,"Visited July 2010. Fantastic old-time stadium, relief from the newer, modern stadiums. Ticket prices very reasonable as was park food. Beautiful scenery outside and within the stadium, well stocked gift shop and parking lot that was easy to navigate. Don't leave without purchasing a classic blue Dodgers water bottle and foam finger!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stm2014
50,A whole new blue,"Visited from the Uk and loved this place. Paid for hospitality and got a front row seat along the first baseline. Dodgers did a great job on and off the field. The place has nostalgia dripping from the bleachers. Great day out and it made my wife a blue. It may not be as modern as Chase Field or quirky features (waterfalls or aquarium) that other ballparks have, ""but it's a must visit"" when your in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/164kevb
30,Angels Rule,"I have been here twice as an Angel fan. The stadium has a lot of old school charm and loved the announcer piped into the restroom. However, this place could be upgraded and offer a lot more modern convenience and comforts. The fans are a little unruly toward visitors and parking and access is a nightmare. Gotta love the better LA team and park in OC. May 2011.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ocjohnyb
40,Great stadium with a police escort,"I took a game in during a visit to LA. I managed to get to the ground using the underground and they the free bus provided by the dodgers. Wow traffic was busy and managed to get a police escort so wasn't too late for the game. The stadium was a great visit and dodgers managed to win. A couple of points is that staff should know more information about the shuttle service provided by dodgers to assist with visiting fans. Also wouldn't bother with garlic fries, had much better elsewhere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lowieEngland
40,One of the Great Ballparks,"Because this is one of the great ballparks, I would recommend Dodger Stadium for any true baseball fan. On the nights we went the Dodgers were playing the Giants; their arch rivals so it was a very intense atmosphere. I have attended many baseball games around the country but I have never experienced anything quite like this. There was a lot of trash talking between LA and SF fans and I don't mean the good natured ribbing kind. I just chalked it up to the fact that these are longtime rivals and this kind of behavior is nothing new. I wouldn't have wanted to have a child with us but it was just my wife & I so we were okay. Overall it was a fun night out and I was glad to have finally seen a game in Dodger Stadium.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fabfourfan
30,STL Cardinals at Dodger Stadium,My husband is the expert and he gave them a three. Narrow walkways... single file up and down the stairs to the seats. I would have given them a 5 because the Cards won and the Dodgers put on an amazing fireworks display after the game. A fun time was had.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FernShaw
50,First timers,This was the 1st time my wife and I had been to a baseball game and what an amazing experience superb from start to finish. I must admit the food wasn't great but it's what you expect from a sports stadium.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/419math
40,Easy babysitting for this grandma,"Experiencing this awesome stadium from a prime location no doubt influences this review. And the tickets were a gift so--another plus. It was a hot day with two kids but their grandpa suggested I stay in the nice cool bar area until the our section was in the shade. It was an easy going crowd there in spite of the excitement over a hockey game instead of the Dodgers. By the time I found my way to the seats, everyone was very comfortable and having a wonderful time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Eadesm
40,Great Baseball Experience,"My favorite team, but not my favorite stadium. As a Las Vegas local, the Dodgers were the team we always got here so they became my favorite. Dodger Stadium is a classic ball park (third oldest i believe) but is a bit dated. The new ownership group has been making minor touchups here and there without ruining the integrity of the stadium, but it's difficult to compete it with the more modern stadiums these days. That being said, the views are amazing at Chavez Ravine and the staff is very friendly. If you take it for what it's worth, you'll have little to complain about.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/36harryl
50,Friday Firework Night!,"Always a great time at Dodger Stadium. Be prepared to spend some money if you buy food there. You can bring in food too, but a Dodger Dog is all part of the experience. As with any stadium a lot of walking uphill to from parking lot to stadium. I personally dont think the parking lot is easy to navigate thru as to where you are sitting in the stadium. Give yourself extra time and allow for LA traffic. The stadium is still a classic great ballpark. A few updated things like play area for kids make it more family friendly.Firework show on Friday nights is great!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmberH809
50,Awesome experience!!!,I have a very nice experience. Though i may not be seating in the field area where I'm at is perfect 151 preferred loge end seats. At this time of the year the shade is in this side of the stadium so it was very nice. Awesome enough to see the whole field and near enough to see the players. It was indeed a great experience for me and ofCourse sharing this moment with the love of my life gives it a memorable time. IPlus our team won!!! Definitely will go back and we will get the same seats again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/U7401PEmarias
30,First went there about 50 years ago,"I first visited Dodger Stadium as a kid in the 60's. It was almost new then and our family had some great times there. Since then I have been to several of the newer stadiums so I was a little let down my last visit. Still, it is baseball, and baseball has been very very good to me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WoodyD18
50,Worth the trip,Great sporting spectacle and worth the trip even if the baseball isn't good then you can enjoy a Dodger fog and a beer as the Californian sun goes down.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NeilByrne
30,Fun game,"Wilson and I watched the Dodgers beat the Cardinals on Saturday June 28 9-1. They scored 6 runs in the second and it was great being with Dodgers fans as they beat those loser Cards! Good selection of food and drink, but expensive which I suppose is normal with L.A.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Packerfancheesehead

50,Do yourself a favour,"If you are coming from another country, do yourself a favour and take in a Baseball game...This stadium was just magnificent. I purchased our tickets on line and to say the least, they were fantastic..under the shade, great view, a lucky choice.Interestingly, there is a ban on unruly behaviour and you can't sledge the opposition or supporters or you will be removed. We didn't care who won but we were astonished at how quick the Dodgers fans turned against their team when they were losing and lucky for me, I had lost my voice or I would have probably been ejected....On game day you can catch a FREE bus to the stadium from Union Station and again after the game which was ever so convenient for us.Had a great day ""Let's go Dodgers""!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sharon_Boyle
50,"what a place , great atmosphere..","fantastic place to see the mighty dodgers play,,saw then win against the st Louis cardinals and was lucky enough to get a brian Wilson bobblehead ,,yeahhhh..the stadium was packed and went off,,,plenty of car parking and easy acsess to the venue,great viewing from where ever you sit and the hotdogs are awesome,,be aware that the price of a beer is very expensive,,no biggy..it helps you to not drink too much..the best thing was the baseball song that all participated in ot the 7th ennings,,that was worth every penny..loved this day and night..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/21GeorgeH

Only $15.00!Sitting high on a hill overlooking LA is simply breathtaking!Our host was knowledgeable and so nice.He led us into stadium, press box, locker rooms, suites and more.Standing on that beautiful field was a thrill!If you are in LA ,and a sports fan, take the time for this great place!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NewArrivals
50,I am a season Ticket Holder for 10 years,"I have been a season ticket holder for a long time and have seen the strides this organization has made in making it a safe and family friendly atmosphere. For awhile, I wouldn't take young kids there because of the atmosphere but it has really changed with the new ownership and team. It is fun again to go see the Boys in Blue work hard and win. Hopefully this is the year we make it to the World Series. I also recommend bringing in your own food, which you can, or get the Gordon Birsch Garlic Fries...To die for!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jonn479
50,Great Ballgame Experience!,"Was able to see a game here. Very nice stadium and the staff was friendly to us. Had a Dodger Dog while watching the game, and had to look for shade as we went to an afternoon game. Wasn't bad to get in and out and we purchased our parking ticker (cheaper) prior to attending the game. Neat place to watch a ballgame.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/86MissyJ
40,Great fun- just remember your hat & sunscreen,"Our seats offered minimum shade during our 1pm game, mind the scorching sun on your neck!Once we settled in and was bathing in our own sweat (lovely) we got to enjoy the game. Such a fun experience for my first live baseball game! Tickets I found to be cheap just over $20 for a good view, more towards the middle/top end seating.You can bring an unopened water bottle into the stadium - it states on the website those with a 'medical condition' can bring in water but we were not questioned at the entrance. in fact I had fruit in my bag too, so I'm thinking food is allowed.The beer was rather expensive at nearly $20 for a pint. The hot dogs are mediocre but you're there for the game right?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cakesandtravel
40,Family friendly but minimal shade,"As a baseball fan who has been to many parks around the nation... And one in Canada...I loved the family feel in Chavez Ravine. However, for a stadium claiming to be family friendly (they even have a nursing area), there's very few seats located in the shade. And on a Sunday afternoon game in the summer, even fast innings can drag on while seated in direct sun with, or without, children. We would def go to another game when in the area next, but would recommend to first time families to check more detailed info on shaded seats! But had a blast and the Dodgers won!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/738breanner
40,Blue Heaven,Our ultimate destination of visiting Dodger Stadium for a ball game did not disappoint. The stadium has a retro feel to it and the causeways are filled withDodger memorabilia and murals allowing the guests and fans to relish the history. Our seats in the tier above the home dugout gave us great sight lines doe the experience which was completed by a solid win for the team on a beautiful afternoon. Only drawback was the lack of diversity in the food offerings. Dodger dogs appear to be just about the only thing offered so be sure to head to the far right field to get some of Tommy Lasordas Italian selections if a dog doesn't cut it for you.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaryKay519
40,It's the Jetsons ballpark,"Went to 2 games here this week, a night game & a day game.some people warned me about the parkin lot being scaryat night but it was fine no problems whatsoever except it takes a while to get out to the highway.my friend that I went with describes it as being the Disneyland of baseball parks. Perhaps because it as as old as Disneyland. It has an old-school feel about it but lots of modern amenities. Wifi, flat screen TVs, modern restrooms and lots of food choices.I was a little bummed that there are no beer or soda vendors that cruise the aisle. When I asked a local why he said it was because they want to make sure that you can walk when you go get your beer and alcohol.if you go to a day game make sure you have plenty of sunscreen because there are not that many seats in the shade.we were able to bring in water of our own with no hassles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OhLorian
50,Love this classic old stadium!,"We got to watch the Dodgers and the Cleveland Indians play in one of the few original outdoor stadiums left in the country. They make the game even more fun, by showing lots of unsuspecting people in the stands up on the Jumbotron, they have trivia and games during breaks where fans play against one of the Dodgers, they have a lot of food and snack choices, beer, slushy blue margaritas, great music, and digital prompters to get the crowd cheering. It does not get much better than that. We were in amazing seats in the 14th row behind first base. It was absolutely awesome!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bstorm
50,loved it!,The dodgers game was fantastic. The stadium is well equipped with food and drink and makes it a fun day out. The bathrooms are cleaned often. We had a bonus movie after the game and some of the actresses from A League of Their Own joined us.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nevn_13
40,Old but... its Dodger freakin Stadium....,"Haven't been there I 10 years and they have made some upgrades but ots just old. The field is awesome and no bad seats but the marketing lacked the pizazz of the newer parks. The food was horrible, the drinks typically overpriced ($12 a beer), but the parking was a major league value at $15. Bottom line, I went to see the Dodgers and the product on the field was excellent that evening.....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelm461
50,"Wonderful visit, good food, beautiful venue","We visited Dodger Stadium with our two Children, ages 7 and 9. We had preferred parking in Lot G which was great because it was so close. The park is so well lit that you can see the field well from most places. We had seats behind homePlate that were amazing. There is no need to eat prior to arrival. The kids and I love Dodger dogs and garlic fries and my husband likes the cheese steak. The people sitting next to us had fruit salad. Would certainly visit again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelingworkingmom
50,Dodger Stadium is an LA MUST in the summer,"There is nothing like a ball game. No matter where you are from, when in Los Angeles, you must visit Chavez Ravine. It has an old style charm that is different than the newer stadiums of today. Go early for batting practice, and be sure to bring a glove for foul balls. A good thing to do is to take the Stadium Tour. An awesome experience. Check to Dodger website for times/prices. Very reasonable and lots of historical information.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/beckster2232524
40,"Looks 10, food 3","Anyone recognize the reference to A CHORUS LINE? Never mind..Dodger Stadium has had a major facelift since I was last there, and it looks terrific! They've instituted a bunch of ""games"" to play while new pitchers are warming up, and it keeps the crowd lively and attentive throughout. Good ideas, all. HOWEVER - I have never had such awful food at a game in all my years, and my first Dodger game was when they first came to LA and were playing at the Coliseum before Dodger Stadium was built. (Boy, am I getting old ..) I had the worst hotdog I think I've ever had with a pretty stale bun. If you want a MUCH better hotdog, go to Costco. It's $1 and it comes with a super sized drink. The peanuts were stale and oversalted - perhaps so you buy more liquids. I tasted the pretzel; couldn't eat it. The best things I had were the root beer and the red vines. Dodgers, you've improved the facility - now it's time to focus on the food!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elysekomer
40,A red shirt in a sea of blue,"Biggest tip to a out of town visitor to Dodger Stadium... wear blue. If you don't have anything blue, buy something blue. Not that anyone was rude but I stuck out like a sour thumb in my red shirt. So much so that an usher came by to talk to me and actually gave my kids some Dodger stuff and thanked us for coming to a game. We made it to batting practice and the Dodger players happily handed out some balls to the kids. The stadium is beautifully situated in the hills and it was hard to keep my eyes on the game and not the scenery. The only down side was that the game ran late so they cancelled the fireworks so as not to wake the neighbors. Still a great time overall.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/j0j03333
50,Dodgers win,Gates open 2 and a half hours before game time. Park opens up two hours before game time. Park staff are very friendly and helpful. Prices are not to ridiculous. The New Era shop in right field is absolutely awesome. Dodger Dogs are a must!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/940KevinH940
20,"Too many rude ""fans""!","Too my wife to Dodgers-Cardinals game last Thursday night. We bought pricey seats in section 5f. We were surrounded by fans who have no concept of manners nor do they really care about the game! In most stadiums you can't go to your seat until an out has occurred, not here, it's up and down whenever you want! A group of 4 from a particular nationality which I won't name spent the entire game in front of me taking ""selfies"" every which way you could imagine! And what's with the countless beach balls all over the park. I watched a young kid spike one into the elderly lady right behind him. The stadium itself is gorgeous, the Dodger dog was fantastic but the crowd around me kept us from enjoying the game. I might as well sat in the bleachers!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RaoulL904
30,Just like LA - not easy to navigate,"Staying true to Los Angeles, Dodger Stadium is not easy to navigate. If you have an upper-level ticket, good luck getting downstairs, even just to look around. This is the only stadium I have been to where this is the case (and I've been to 20+ MLB stadiums). Since the majority of folks I saw in the upper levels were families, it's unclear whether this is blatant classism or an actual security issue (which is doubtful). Don't fret though, even if you have lower-level tickets (which we did), you'll still have a tough time navigating your way downstairs to your seats. I was told there was only one stairway behind home plate where you could go between the cheap seats and the good seats.Pros: lemon-shandy on draft, centralized parking (tip: pay in advance online and save $5)Cons: no areas around the stadium to eat, drink, or socialize; not easy to navigateTips for visiting team fans - sit next to the visitor's bullpen (5th row, lower level, right next to bullpen ran about $40 each); you can bring in coolers - check their website for details.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PaulD251
40,Great Experience and nice ball park,"Caught a game against the Cards and the ball park can still hold it's own . If you like to see the whole park it is not really possible to roam around. If you buy an upper level ticket it is very hard to see the park. Great view, great hot dog and great sight lines. If you are going to a game during the day you might want to check your row for shade. We sat in Section 3 row E and baked 10 rows behind was shaded the whole game",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Biztravr
50,A Perfect Place to Watch Baseball,"Being from Boston, I was raised believing that Fenway Park was ""the gem"" of MLB, and all other parks couldn't compare. WRONG! Dodger Stadium has it all over Fenway, from sight-lines, comfort, concessions (including a great beer selection and Dodger Dogs) and between inning entertainment, Dodger Stadium puts old Fenway to shame.If you are a baseball fan and are in the Los Angeles area, this is a mandatory pilgrimage! Don't miss it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/746PatrickH
40,Have to have a Dodger Dog,"I have been going for years to see SF-Dodgers. The ball field is older but clean, very safe and great hot dogs. It does take time to get out of the game as parking sucks as people are driving all over to get a spot.. It is worth the time to go there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DD19351
10,Stadium Tour before the Game - Don't!,"I've never taken the tour of the stadium on a day when they weren't playing, so don't use this review when considering this particular tour. Our experience was with the Pre-Game tour, which cost $30.00 per person. Don't. Waste. Your. Money. The tour consisted of taking us on a ""behind the scenes"" tour of the stadium, which consisted of visiting the trophy and awards areas, which are actually pretty much accessible to the public before any game. It also consisted of visiting the old visitor's locker room - really? Then we walked through the VIP dining area, so we could see and smell all the fancy and wonderful food that we were not allowed to enjoy. Finally, we were taken not to the field, but to the field-level bleachers where we watched some of the players warming up, who all completely ignored us. Really, the tour couldn't even arrange to have one player come over for 5 minutes and say ""hi!"" This ended our tour, where we were presented with a commemorative photo of us in the bleachers, with the field in the background....for $10.00!!! They couldn't even throw in a free picture! As a bonus, the tour ended with almost two hours to go before the game so we were basically stranded there, wandering around until the start of the game. Just don't.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ilgogetmyball
40,Experience the American way of life,"This vacation we wanted to live more like the North-American people do. So we bought tickets to a baseball game. You have no waiting lines to park your car, thank God, and you are in the stadium in no-time. The view is great from every point but the atmosphere was a little bit poor. You only hear people selling food/drinks and 10% is watching the game. But we watched it and the whole ""show"" around it is great to be part of. Overall we had like a three hour seating and too bad they lost this time, but it was worth our money. Go Dodgers!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F_Zakonski
50,Better than when I was a kid,"As a high schooler, my buddy Dave and I used to drive out to the stadium, pay a few bucks and sit in the left field bleachers hoping to grab a home run in row K. We always joked about someone with ""k row power"" but never got a sniff of a home run. Back then you would enter in from the parking lot, grab a steamed dodger dog and head to row K. Many years later, my wife and I headed to the stadium and decided to give the left field bleachers a try. We got row B and were about 6 inches from a home run ball hitting me in the noggin. The area behind the bleachers is now really nice, a bar with seats overlooking the bullpen, tons of food options and always a former dodger signing autographs. We decided to opt for italian food at Tommy Lasorda's Pasta place. Tommy was standing out in front. We got a picture with him before buying our pasta which was restaurant quality. It's always been a beautiful stadium. Parking was a snap and we had a great time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T329KTmikeb
50,Great Hot Dogs,"The Super Dodger Dog was the best hot dog so far on my tour of baseball stadiums. Definitely get one :) The stadium is older and has a nostalgic feel to it. My family was glad to see the game and there doesn't seem to be any bad seats, but the higher level ones are steep. I wish I had paid a bit more to be lower to the ground.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/360janam
50,Outstanding customer service,"On a recent vacation trip to LA, we decided to see a Dodgers game. We arrived by bus which is the only way to get there without the migraine that is LA traffic. We must have looked like midwesterners because a Hostess named Velvet greeted us like we were long lost cousins come to the big city. She took us to several photo ops, got 1st time visitor certificates, bobbleheads, and Dodger baseball hats. In short, she made us feel like we were the only ones visiting that night. Oh, by the way, the Dodgers won!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ahaskell
50,The Happiest Place on Earth!,"We went to Dodger Stadium for a 5 game series. While we were there, we participated in both the pre-game and stadium tours. The stadium is very well designed and easy to navigate. The staff is excellent, friendly, and very, very helpful. There were plenty of food options to try something new each night, though the traditional Dodger Dogs were hard to beat. I highly recommend the Zebra Popcorn by Popcornalicious. The tours were lots of fun...we got to go down to the field level, dugouts, trophy rooms, etc. The tour guides were friendly and well informed. Be sure to visit the different stores at the stadium because each store carries unique items. Also, visit the Top of the Park to see the retired numbers and the right field pavilion to see the statues of six World Series rings. The fans were great and very welcoming. Visiting Dodger Stadium is the best family vacation we have ever had. We can't wait to return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SES500
40,Love my Dodgers,Went to see my Dodgers on 6/16/14 with the fam. Dodgers won 6-1 vs Rockies. Great game. Sat in right field pavilion for the first time. A lil tight squeeze but good view to my surprise. Good food too! Wish the sold the desserts closer though. All around great experience without any problems.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KCJC808
20,Bottom of our list of Ball Parks,"My husband & I enjoy visiting stadiums on our vacations. Our stadium for the year was Dodger Stadium - too bad we really didn't get to ""see it"". Apparently, you cannot walking around the stadium during game time(or right before). We bought tickets in the higher level, wanted to walk around the first level - nope - Not a chance. We have never heard of such a thing at a ball park!?! We were instructed that we could go get a ""visitor"" pass, to get down to the bottom level - but guess what - There were none left and guest assistance was not helpful. So then we thought about upgrading our tickets but it was going to be $40 extra dollars to upgrade, to see a stadium that appeared to be pretty lack-luster anyways. The food selection was poor and the nachos we did get were stale & the cheese was cold. We have been to about 15 ball parks and Dodger stadium is on the bottom of our list. There is absolutely nothing around it and I can honestly say we will never-ever return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jam536
40,"Great night, great seats, great game!","We attended a game at Dodger Stadium during our trip to Southern California and had a delightful time!We purchased our tickets (upper deck) on an online discount site so we saved some coin there. We also paid for general parking online in advance and saved $5. It was worth it.I've read several of the reviews where folks are complaining about the cost of food. Frankly, I didn't find the prices to be that much higher than what we would pay at the minor league games we attend in our hometown. And the food we had was very good -- Dodger Dog (gotta do that!), Big Blue Burger, garlic fries (wow!).We also stayed for the fireworks after the game.Extra Bonus - the stadium went bonkers when they announced that the LA Kings had won the Stanley Cup.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NCTravelingFamily
40,Nice Summer Night,"On June 1st 2014 we went to a 5pm game against the Padres. We showed up at 4:15pm and parking was very easy. The walk from the car to the stadium wasn't too long and it was quick to get into the park. I am not supposed to be in the sun at all and was a little disappointed that umbrellas are not allowed into the stadium. The gentleman at the gate was nice enough to let us check my umbrella instead of making us walk all the way back to the car. I was afraid I was going to get sick by sitting in the sun but luckily our seats had been in the shade the entire time (thank god). We sat in section 33 row T. We had a great view of everything and close to concessions/restroom. The stadium was clean and you could tell that it was a historical stadium. It felt like you stepped back in time a little bit. Just like with any sporting event there are always annoying people around you, but it comes with the territory. The stadium is notorious for having ALOT of traffic after the game. At the beginning of the 8th inning people started leaving to try to beat it. If you want to avoid too much traffic you may want to follow their lead. PS Adrain Gonzales song is beyond annoying!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/832kristenb
50,Views to die for,If you ever get the chance go to a Dodgers game.Where we sat to which was the upperdeck to the right handside of the playing field (10H row 12) views were amazing.If you are one that dont like heights than best take a lower level. Here you think you are going to fall out cause the stairways are steep lol.All in all an experience not to let pass(:,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jodecirossi
40,1st Baseball Game Evah!,"For our first experience at a baseball game, my family and I had a lot of fun! It's a little tricky to find, but perhaps it was because they had all the gates closed except one due to the fact it was for a high school city championship game. Once we got through the gates, parking was easy (And there is a huge amount of parking). Tickets were easy to acquire, security was very good; and the food was good: for two small drinks and garlic fries (which were amazing!): $19.75. CHA-Ching! The seats are pretty comfortable, considering.........views look good from all areas.Our team won.......so yes, this first experience at Dodger Stadium was very good!Sidebar: Chinatown is nearby for some good eats, and you have to also try Philippes! :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChumsMum01

30,Great experience but the Dodger dogs disappoint,"This stadium is on top of a hill with mad lines of cars trying to park in one of the biggest car parks I've seen! My tip, get the bus like we did. The stadium is amazing with friendly staff everywhere. Being my first baseball game I wanted the whole experience but was dismayed by the disappointing Dodger Dogs. Absolutely nothing special about them at all. Had better on Guide Camp!! The game was fun but taking in the atmosphere was even better. Great experience and amazing views of downtown LA at night after the game.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travel_junkie05
50,"""Stadium on a hill""","There is a beautiful view of Downtown LA from one of the parking lots. Nice. Parking is organized. Workers are polite and helpful. Doyer dogs are tasty. But not the best ive had. Game was good, but i was more entertained by the characters around me. Like the people behind me chanting in spanish. Clean atmosphere. I have also been there for HARVEST, a christian event for free, by Harvest ministries, Riveside, CA, so if you cant pay the entrance and parking, go then!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Yeddie_go
50,Great Park,I have been to roughly 30 baseball stadiums. This one is fantastic. And the Dodger dogs are the best hotdogs in any of the parks. It is a great place to see a game. I am very happy that I was able to attend a game here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LostALot22
50,Wonderful stadium!,I saw my first baseball game live with my husband at this wonderful stadium. I have always loved the Dodgers so on my first visit to LA from Australia I was lucky enough to catch them at home. The crazy freeways there was the only con. The pros were so much more. Car parking was very organised. Having a dodger dog while watching the game was a dream come true. The experience was just awesome! It is a pity that they dodgers didn't win!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/546JoyceK
50,favourite part of my month long holiday,"im not even kidding, watching a baseball game here on my overseas trip to america was one of the highlights. my mate and i who are from Australia, both 23 went on a sunny saturday afternoon and watched dodgers vs giants. it was the most amazing atmosphere and the funnest afternoon ever. we got pretty decent seats for around 60 bucks and we bought a hat and massive hand and just drank beer all arvo. was a mission to get there as we waited around half hour for a cab in hollywood but eventually go there. they had massive beers and kiss cam and songs and it was just the best. everyone was so nice. you must not miss this!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chevmeister
50,The only way a tourist should watch a game,It has been a life long dream as an Australian Dodgers fan to watch a game at Dodgers Stadium.Took my wife and two children (6&4yrs) for an afternoon game.Traveling through downtown LA to get to the stadium was the only hassle we had the whole time. We parked easily and made our way into the stadium and that's when the atmosphere hits you. As you enter the stash is a buzz with fans and a see of Blue starts to emerge.The stadium has a heap of stores to by new merchandise and the food and beverage stalls are everywhere. A must do is of course the Dodgers dog. It was also great to be able to by food in little souvenir helmets for the kid.Get there early and have a chance to walk around and up to the top deck as the view is awesome. The fans/locals are fanatics and them alone are a must see. The game is always entertaining. Even having two younger children they loved the night and still keep talking about it.For Aussies coming over I recommend using Stub Hub for purchasing tickets. It's easy and no hassles and are good priced.Definitely one of the greatest times traveling.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mattmboom
40,One more for the bucket list,"I've promised myself that I will visit every baseball stadium and take in a game. So while on a trip to LA, I went to see a game at Dodgers Stadium. I was a little bit disappointed. As it is one of the last remaining ""old"" stadiums (Fenway and Wrigley being the others), I was expecting more nostalgia or ""something special"" about the stadium itself, but I didn't get it or feel it. I've been to old Yankee Stadium and Fenway Park. In those places you get the sense of history. At Dodger Stadium, not so much.Don't get me wrong...you can never have a bad night at a baseball game, no matter which stadium it is. But I guess I was expecting more or something different. The game was fine, the food was fine, the seat I purchased was great, the weather was perfect, but I wanted a sense of history that I just didn't feel. It felt like any other ballpark.I rated it as Very Good instead of Average because everything else about it was perfect, but if you're looking for a feeling of history or nostalgia, this isn't the place to find it. Unless perhaps you're a long-time Dodger fan who has been going to the games for years and years.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cbozman
50,A must visit,"Went with a few business colleagues, our first baseball game and what an experience.

50,Blue Heaven,"What place has brought me joy over the years? Where do I have guaranteed fun? Which place has filled my mind with so many fond memories? Dodger Stadium is the answer to all of those questions!I have loved Dodger Stadium ever since I was a child. The Dodgers are a classic, storied baseball team with many notable players over the years. This stadium does so well to serve as a home for our current team and honor those who have played America's favorite pastime here.Dodger fans are a rare breed, yet there is no way to put labels or classify them as a certain type. We come in all colors, ages, creeds, genders, and backgrounds. I love the variety of people that fill the stands.The recent upgrades are wonderful and add a fun touch to the Dodger game experience. I love all of the quirky monuments!Have a world famous Dodger Dog, the amazing garlic fries, or some peanuts and cracker jacks... they even have fancy margaritas too.

It also helps to know where to enter the park to your eat before you park, or you might have to walk half way around the stadium, as the parking lot encompasses the stadium.

40,Must visit for baseball fans,"As a Mets fans from the UK who grew up visiting his dad in New York every year, my passion for baseball has been there since my first trip to Shea in 1980.During various trips to the US, I've tried to catch a game at as many ballparks as I can. As well as Shea, Citi Field and both Yankee Stadiums, I've seen games at Wrigley, the old Comiskey, AT&T Park, the old Veterans Stadium, Coors Field and even the old Kingdome in Seattle (was lucky enough to see Griffey Jr play).So a week in LA with the Dodgers playing the Met's rival Phillies was an opportunity not to be missed.Dodger Stadium didn't disappoint with open walkways and ample concessions. The seats were comfortable with good legroom (I'm 6'4"") and the atmosphere good even on a Wednesday night.My only negative is the parking which is ample but took a long time to get into and out of.Overall a great way to spend an evening in LA and I'm so glad I managed to add Dodger Stadium to my list.And the Phillies lost....which was nice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/759jonw

40,Baseball royalty,"We have been to ballgames at Dodger Stadium before but we decided to visit this park again to see the improvements that have been made over the past two years. Getting in to the stadium is fairly easy. There are multiple entrances around the stadium. I prefer the Elysian Park entrance since it seems to have extra lanes into the park. If you dont have preferred parking, the parking attendants guide you to the general parking lots that are usually located quite a distance from the stadium. I purchased preferred parking online and we were able to park fairly close to the stadium entrance. We also bought seats in the Loge Level. This level affords the best view of the game since it is not too high and not too low. We have sat on the field level before and it just seems like the viewing angle is not optimal. The stadium was clean as a whistle as usual. Dodger Stadium is the only major league baseball venue that is designed with terraced entrances. This means that you can enter any level of the stadium from grade level. Some of the improvement include: remodeled restrooms with additional sinks and toilets. Casual standing drink areas. New restaurants including Brooklyn style pizza and a create your own hot dog venue. The Loge level has also been brightened with a new coat of paint and additional lighting. New 50 inch tvs have also been installed at the top of every aisle throughout the stadium. The stadium also has a new sound system with hundreds of speakers throughout. The nicest new feature is the reconstruction of the scoreboards. Both scoreboards now match each other and have the original mid modernist geometry. They also boast the largest 1080 screens in all of sports. They are extraordinarily clear and make video broadcasts fun to watch. All of the improvement have been tastefully done and have not robbed this park of its original design intent. If there are negatives to be told, the food at Dodger Stadium has always been lacking in quality in my opinion. The famous Dodger Dogs seem old and tired. We tried the Brooklyn Pizza and it was pretty good, though not exceptional. There is a new grilled burger restaurant on the reserved level but we did not go up there to try it. This stadium also has some of the highest beer prices in all of baseball. 13 dollars for a premium beer!All in all there is a certain magical aura about being at Dodger Stadium. It has been the host to so many historical events and history making games. One can just sit there and imagine what it was like to see Koufax perfect game or Gibsons 9th inning home run in the 88 world series. These are the kind of landmarks that should never be torn down. We really enjoyed our visit to Dodger Stadium. We will definitely be back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gene2459
50,Nice older Stadium,We came in from Orange County. Took the 405 to the 710 to 5. We arrived about 1-1.5 hrs before game time and parked in the Academy lot in row 3. We were very close to the entrance. The stadium is older but very nice. We tried the dodger dogs and they were great. We had seats in the Loge sec 128. The view was awesome from this level. Not to high. Getting out after the game was quick and easy. The only jam we got into was when we got on 5. But we went back the way we came and stayed off the 5 and had no traffic slow downs.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dnrdavies
50,"Best Park in MLB, and here is why...","The 3rd oldest park in MLB sure doesn't look like it! The fans here are great and since new ownership took over in 2012 the park is better than ever. I have been to 12 MLB stadiums and this is the best! Dodger Stadium is large, spacious, open and has some amazing sunset views of the Hollywood sign and San Gabriel Mountains to the North. Good food and beer selection at expected ballpark prices, parking can be messy at times but is mostly pretty smooth. I must say there is not really a bad seat in the yard, and also affordable tickets can always be found using online ticket outlets. I love coming back here time after time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y8983VPtimothym
40,A must for baseball fans,"My sons and I have made a habit of visiting ballparks on vacation and wanted to see a couple of games at Dodger stadium.The one thing that stops this from being a 5 for me is parking / entry. According to multiple people we talked with, there is basically only one way to get to the park. As we like to get to the games early to watch batting practice, we tried to arrive around 5PM. However, there is mainly the stadium parking lot to use (otherwise it's a very long walk uphill). And they don't open until 5PM. Which means you sit and sit and sit in traffic. That was a pain. The 2nd day, we got there really early (4:30). While we had to wait until the gates opened, at least once they did, we were able to park immediately and watch practice.The other downside to the stadium is food selection, which is a bit minimal compared to newer parks.This said, it's a great stadium. It feels very small, so I was shocked to hear that attendance was 60,000.One thing about the stadium that stood out...the people - fans and employees - were more friendly than anywhere else we've been - even our home stadium in Detroit. We wore our Tigers gear, and rather than give us nasty looks, people would stop and talk to us, ask us how we were enjoying our time. During batting practice, a ball got hit into an area that was closed. A security guard got the ball, and came up to give it to one of my sons. He said he wanted to make sure visitors felt welcomed and left with a good impression. All I can say is WOW! What a nice gesture.(Of course the highlight was when Justin Verlander, who was shagging fly balls in the outfield, caught one, turned towards us, motioned for my 8 year-old son to come to the fence, and tossed him the ball)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scottg958
50,Early season game for this out of town visitor,"We purchase great field level seats the day before (a little high price but worth it for this fan). We sat in a shaded area. We saw a win in extra innings, Dodgers vs Detroit, two top division teams. Bathrooms nearby our seats. Plenty of vendors and concessions stands with average waiting times.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CyndeeR431
10,Pricey trip out.,"$7.50 for Dodger dog and $16 for a cup of beer. Be ready to shell out beaucoup bucks for 1 baseball game. Unless you sit close to the field, the actual game will not mean much except on the big screen.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Quoizimodo
50,fab!,"easy to get to from our hotel in west hollywood, we caught the train to union station i think it was and from there is a free bus that takes you right up to the stadium. staff outside the stadium are helpful to guide you which way to go. if your wanting to leave early there are plenty of taxis right outside and i believe the buses run throughout the entire game back to the station. we bought ticket really cheap on stub hub and had a good view being fairly close!

50,A Real part of LA Sports History - A Must Go Stadium,"Although this stadium was built in 59-62 (see Wikipedia for all that techno history) it is and continues to be a top notch park with everything one could want from a ball park, The Maintenance is immaculate, the staff is all very personable, I mean all. from the parking attendants, ticket takers, security, food service and guards at the aisles, everybody. Add this in with a jumbo tron TV that looks better than most peoples TV and you have a great experience.

Expensive, but yummy (for stadium food).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/em291
50,Beautiful stadium with incredible views!,Hard to believe the Dodgers Stadium is the 3rd oldest ballpark in league. The stadium is beautiful and very unique since you can enter any level of the stadium because it's built on a hill. I think the best seats for the value are the Blue Reserved seats between the bases. Top Deck isn't that bad...great views from up there. If you're buying seats for a day game try to get a high row on the 3rd base side to avoid the sun. Great family atmosphere. Dodgers fans are chill and friendly.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lumerian
50,Great tour,"The tour of Ddger Stadium was abour 80 miniutes long and I went on it because my grandson wanted to go. I have no interest at all in baseball but I was more than pleasantly surprised at how interesting this tour was. The stadium has a history that was captivating, the host of the tour was very knowledgeable and friendly, the stadium itself is architecturally interesting and I was suprised when the 80 minutes was over! I may even watch a game or two after that!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Honeymoonjunkie
40,very interesting and worthwhile,"I became a Dodger fan when I was 7 and I remain a fan today. This was a visit to the centre of the Dodger world and I really enjoyed it. Our guide, Raymond, had a lot of information and presented it very well. We visited a week before the team started playing in the stadium for the season and therefore there was a lot of preparation work underway that caused us to miss a few things but the tour is still an excellent option for any baseball fan and certainly for every Dodger fan. We were in the 10:00 group which was only about a dozen people. The following group was probably 4 times the size of ours. I suggest you go to the earlier tour because some areas, like the press box, are quite tight spaces and a large group would make visiting those areas much more difficult.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ROBERTN_13
40,Amazing views,"Visited as part of a city sightseeing tour. No games were held at the time. You have amazing views all over the city so if for nothing else but for the views, it is definitely worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FrankieinLondon
50,Don't Dodge the Dodger Stadium,"We go to about 10-12 games each season as we share in season tickets. Our seats are great as they are near 3rd base and only 10 rows from the field. We love the fireworks nights and stay in our seats watching hundreds walk down from upper levels to stand on the field and watch them. The food is really good here as opposed to hot dogs tried in stadiums in Boston, New York and San Diego. The Mexican food is yummy and the hot fresh made pretzels at the pretzel stand are better than getting them at the food stands. The garlic fries have become so full of garlic and oil that you can smell them two rows behind you and after loving them the first few years, now find them too greasy for my taste. Each level has some stands that are a bit different in their offerings. We have never had people behind us or in front of us that are inappropriate either by behaviors or language. We have always felt safe and found out that this year, season ticket holders actually get a parking space if your season tickets include parking. The main complaint I have is when arriving and you are in the lane for season tickets, after passing through the gate, there are lanes on either side of you crossing over to get into the general parking lots as everyone gets in all the lanes regardless of their parking assignment.Just be careful and expect cars cutting in on either side of you.The two big screens are great, music is upbeat and current and you can't beat the 7th inning stretch and singing ""Take me out to the Ballgame"".Warning - if getting tickets for a daytime game, especially when the weather is over 80-95 be sure to find out if your seats will have direct sun the entire time or if sitting where we sit the shade comes after 4 p.m. If you like the heat and sun, be sure to wear a hat, bring a washcloth to wring out with cold water and be sure to use the sunscreen on your face, neck and the back of your neck.The bathrooms on the field level were all redone two or three years ago and smell just fine. They have added so many more stalls so there is rarely a long wait unless you go at peak times like the 7th inning stretch or after the first inning when everyone is getting their food and using the restrooms.Go Dodgers!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/385eileenz
30,"Great baseball, once you finally get here.","We traveled from Anaheim to LA for a Dodgers game and it took over 3 hours! LA traffic is horrible. Lesson learned!!!Once we got to the stadium, we had to pay for parking before we made it to the game. We arrived during the second inning. Once we were inside and settled down with our blue margaritas and Dodger dogs, we were fine. The game was great, the announcers were wonderful, and there was a lot of activities going on. The kids had a great time, and enjoyed the game very much.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bbsteele

20,Good time but needs improvements in cleaning the restrooms,"Even tho I had a good time this stadium was a bit plain and boring. The only thing I had a problem with this stadium was the bathrooms, as soon as you go in all you can smell is urine and almost all the stalls were full of urine is like no one has time to flush or to clean up.

There were about twice as many staff as customers but they all seemed far more intersted in talking to each other that caring for customers. When I asked for assistance was sharply told - 'they are over there' before they continued talking amongst themselves. Just totally apathetic to customers - couldn't care less.Shame as they are a good team and have terific support - perhaps it was just a bad day - I suspect not.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Doolish

Usually don't buy photos but they actually had reasonable prices.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vancouverrobert
40,Nice Stadium,It is not the best stadium I have been to but its not the worst either. The stadium is showing its age but its still worth the trip to go. One of the best parking situations for a stadium though.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/164scottm
30,Like an old Hollywood Starlet showing her age.,"Dodger Stadium does indeed have a certain beauty. As poster Tom Tuffy said, the backdrop of the mountains is unlike most in baseball. But as far as stadiums go....lots to be desired.The access to the stadium is ferociously bad, except for VERY early arrivals. The fwy is jammed most times. There is zero mass transit/subway access, like most ""in city"" stadiums. Once you're in, gobble down that beer and hot dog because you'll soon be following the throng, deserting the game after the sixth inning (presumably to beat the fwy traffic).The place is in dire need of a paint job and replacement of the fading seats. The bathrooms are ancient and decrepit. Who still has troughs in the mens room (with ads for DWI lawyers visible).Of course, the big problem (for the team) is the lack of big revenue generating luxury boxes. Not a big deal to the average working stiff, but tough on the bottom line when trying to compete against money machines elsewhere that have them.The Dodgers do a good job of putting makeup on this old lady.....but go to a game at one of the newer parks in baseball and you'll see what's lacking. GIVING IT ITS DUE: Being a Met fan, I have to tip my cap to the way they've kept this place up. Shea Stadium, despite being newer, was a dump 20 years after it opened. Dodger Stadium has seen lots of stadiums come and go (Three Rivers, Riverfront, and Shea come to mind). Its outlasted them all.PERSONAL RANT: A few years ago I paid top dollar to sit in the newly added field boxes down the right field line. Despite being peddled as premium seats, little of the game was visible other than the right and center fielders. Stay away from these seats at all cost.Three months till pitchers and catchers report!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kennyl98

Went with some friends during this year's NLCS, and the place was absolutely electric. Game started at 5:00pm, which is a perfect time of day to showcase the beauty of the stadium against the backdrop of the San Gabriel mountains!Dodger Stadium is a real treat for any baseball fan!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A4231SRtomt

50,Nothing beats kicking back and enjoying the American pastime.,"Dodger Stadium is the place to be, especially during this time of year, when the boys in blue are in the midst of an intense playoff run. You can bet the atmosphere will be electric for nine innings of heart pumping action. Every time we come to a Dodgers game the kids have an absolute blast! I must recommend the home run bleacher seats. It really feels like a family out there, with everyone cheering their hearts out on every play. Also remember to not miss out on those tasty Dodger dogs!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/633cliffw
50,The highlight of our holiday!,"As Brits, we had never been to a baseball game before and honestly I was not keen (I thought it would be akin to cricket and that is terminally dull). However, the stadium, the atmosphere, the rituals were all fabulous fun. I cannot think of a team sport in the UK which would have this family friendly but passionate vibe. We all thoroughly enjoyed it, for me despite not having a clue who was winning until I asked my son in the 8th innings. If we lived in the US, we would be regulars. The traffic is very heavy entering and leaving the stadium so leave plenty of time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tripper43

30,"I love the stadium, but not the fans.","I never get bored of visiting Dodger Stadium. Despite the fact I'm a Padres fan, it doesn't stop me from visiting Dodger Stadium to enjoy some good baseball. I'm very happy the way that the stadium refurbished the stadium, bringing in new jumbo visions and scoreboard, children's play area, and modern concession stands. Dodger Stadium in located above a hill, where it renders nice weather in day games and chilly weather at night. I always look forward to the Friday Night Fireworks :-). Unfortunately, what makes the stadium deteriorate its overall pleasant environment are the Dodger fans. Dodger fans are the most horrific, rude, and inconsiderate fans of all MLB franchise. Every game I go to, there's always Dodger fans causing trouble among the crowds, especially causing trouble to visiting fans. As I've previously mentioned, I'm a Padres fan who lives in LA, and when my team is in town, I come to see them and I do wear my Padres apparel; however, I get taunted, cussed at, insulted at, and the occasional throwing of objects to me. It's ridiculous how I can't enjoy watching my visiting team play without these Dodger fans hindering my ballgame experience. Also, management needs to do something about those print-at-home tickets, because the fans are using the paper to create paper airplanes and tossing them in the air, landing either in the field, or at other people (not sure if anyone has been hit in the head or poked in the eye, as a result. Dodger fans will not stop me from coming here to enjoy the game, and I'm glad I'm not part of this fan base who dwells in such deviant behavior.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/armysgt1981
20,Unimpressive,"I am a bit of a baseball stadium nut, and my review of Dodger Stadium should be considered relative to other MLB stadiums. Dodger Stadium opened in 1962, and it shows. There really isn't much here that is unique to Los Angeles or to MLB stadiums. There is plenty of history and tradition to be displayed with the franchise, but I think the stadium does a poor job of relaying it to visitors. Plain, open horseshoe concrete stadium, and a significant portion of the seating feels like it is too far away from the action. Late-arriving and early-leaving crowd. Good luck finding interesting food options, because I didn't see much. Horrendous traffic getting into and out of the park, so build in lots of time on both ends of the game. Thankfully, there is an excellent product on the field, as the Dodgers are a playoff-caliber team and played like one on the night I was there. However, overall this stadium has been left behind by the new wave of parks that have been built over the last 20 years.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/xylograph

30,Clean but boring,I'm used to AT&T park in San Francisco. So that's my reference.Parking is cheap at $10.The place seats like 50k and I would not want to be in the high deck behind home.There are almost no food options. Pass the temptation to get a Dodger Dog. Horrible. But there really isn't much else. There was a small pizza concession and several places to buy alcohol. It was weird that even at a sold out game there were no lines for anything. I think because everyone knew not to eat there.They play organ music between innings. Traditional but Boring. They have two giant video scoreboards with a weird diamond shape. Why? They don't use them for entertainment much. Just the dreaded Kiss Cam.There was a lot of blue I the crowd but the Giants won 19 to 3 so there was not much to get the crowd going.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Donsailsboats
40,Neat place to catch a Game,"First thing you notice is that the stadium is easy to get to. There is tons a parking and it is only $10. Compare that to places like DC and NYC which start at $30 anywhere near the stadium. Easy walk directly to the stadium. Got a ticket one level above the press box for only $22. The view was outstanding and we were closer to field than I expected. Food prices are moderate. $5 long Dodgers dogs are the way to go. Some neat food choices, Carls Jr, garlic fries, salads, wraps, and all the traditional baseball fare. Saw several people with nachos that were served in a full size Dodgers batting helmet. Beer ranges from $6 and up depending on can/bottle size. Lots of food vendors walking around but no beer vendors. The game was great as well. The view of the stadium is nice with the Palm trees on the sides. 2 large TV scoreboards make it easy to see wherever you are sitting. If you are a baseball fan then you need to catch a game here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trsfla
50,"An awesome day out, its a must for anyone","So my boyfriend and I were not fans of baseball before this trip but decided to see what all the fuss was about. We were not disappointed! ! We stayed in Hollywood and got two buses to get there which took about an hour and then a ten min walk uphill to the entrance. We got our tickets from uk so just had to collect them once tickets stands were open, only waited ten mins for that. They have an area you can go in before the game where all the sponsership companies set up stalls and you can get free hats, towels and facepainting. You can also get merchandise, food and drink. We sat in left pavillion which was in the sun all day but thankfully there were a few spaces in the shade so we could just move when someone came to their seat. The hat we won previously came into good use with a very hot day!! The game lasted 3 hrs in total and then due to them celebrating a film called the Sandlot 20th anniversary, they showed the film on the big screens afterwards and let everyone go on the playing field to watch it also cast from the film were there signing autographs for people the whole time. Food and drink was expensive but it was expected at a venue like that. We purchased the tickets for little cost so we didnt feel ripped off. They have free shuttle buses to take you to union square metro line which meant we could go back to hollywood from there. Overall, great day, great atmosphere, we are now fans of the sport would recommend to everyone!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cjx130386
20,"Eh, just so so!","Dodger Stadium hum, what an interesting ballpark. We were staying in Anaheim, so left at 9:30 a.m. for a 1:00 p.m. game. The stadium was a mere 23 miles from Anaheim yet took about an hour and three quarters to get to. Parking was cheap at $10 / car and there was plenty of space. There was premium parking for $35, which was closer to the stadium if you like. This was also available if you drove a Lexus for $20, how L.A.! With us being from San Francisco and being Giant’s fans, we went incognito (the Giant’s were not playing L.A. that day and we didn’t feel like being beaten up. It is no secret that Dodger fans have become highly violent in the past when they face someone they don’t like. My daughter and I took no chances.Dodger Stadium is quite old, but it was very clean and is well maintained. Food choices are very limited it seemed and Dodger Dog shops were everywhere, 4 or 5 in a row next to each other. Some other food mixes, but not much.The stadium is fitted with padded seats which actually were quite nice. However, there is absolutely no room for anyone to pass in front of you, thus everyone needs to completely stand up and in some cases move to the aisle to provide access to other spectators.Everyone around us was very polite (they didn’t know we were incognito) and L.A. pretty dressed to the hilt in Dodger garb. The weather was beautiful but a bit warm in the sun behind home plate. We received free Nomo Bobble-head that day and did see Jessica Sanchez (American Idol Runner Up) sing the National Anthem, but decided to depart in the middle of the 7th inning. We were glad to go and being rivals hope the Dodgers don’t make the World Series.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SFtravelbugs

We couldn't site in our cars while waiting for the game to start (apparently they though we were drinking...but we were not). So we went into the stadium and finally found the right entrance for our seats. My husband smokes and had to go into a little jail looking area to do it. We paid $10 for a 20oz beer, $7 for hotdog, etc (expensive). We ended up leaving the game early because there were so many rude fans and staff that we couldn't stand it anymore.

50,Definitely under new management!,"I visited Dodger stadium on July 30, 2013. You can definitely tell it's under new management since the last time I was there. More security , nicer staff , cleaner, and obviously renovated !!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cali4niagirl87
50,What a fun evening!!!,"Have been going to see the Dodgers since they moved to Los Angeles in the late 50's. It is a wonderful experience. We like the evening games so it cools off. On your way their stop by Phillipe's, Olvera Street or China town. I want to go again soon, they are on such a roll.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MauiBonnie
50,Brilliant!,"I booked tickets to see a Dodgers game months ahead when we were planning our first trip to the West Coast. Coming from the UK and travelling as a family with two older teenagers I thought that seeing a baseball game would be a real taste of the USA. Tickets were very reasonably priced, especially compared to Premier league matches in England! Parking round the stadium was easy and the staff around the ground were incredibly friendly and helpful. We did splash out a bit in the shop, getting our Dodgers t-shirts and then our hot dogs but it was all part of the fun. The stadium itself is amazing and surrounded by the stunning Hollywood Hills. I knew nothing about baseball but picked up the rules very quickly, the atmosphere in the crowd is very good natured and so much goes on around the spectators that its easy to get distracted from the game itself.We are all now proud to be Dodgers fans and it was the best thing we did in LA. I would recommend it to anyone visiting from abroad.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/skitortoise
40,Great baseball fan experience,"Used GPS based on real time traffic for our summer baseball stadium tour (this year Angels, Dodgers, Giants, A’s). Arrived 2 hours early, lively crowd for first game of a home stand after the All Star break, and first game at home in 1st place, so the energy around and in the park was great. Beautiful setting, with the mountains beyond the park (even nice on a smoggy late afternoon). Scale of park felt good, set in the ravine. Many levels to enter the park, giving it an open feel. Nice graphics on the walls for rest rooms, club history, concessions. Scoreboard very disappointing, given the recent $100 million renovation. Too much data in too small space, too many colors, fonts too small. They need to visit some of the new stadiums with high-def screens. Sang “Take me out to the ballgame” twice during the stretch, a nice touch. Not too much between innings marketing after the first few innings. P.A. system not overbearing. Crowd very engaged with team and the game. Nice experience. I don’t like LA (city or the team), but I’d come to a game here again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EmptyNest_60
50,"Loved it , even though my team lost","I had always wanted to take my 13 year old to a game at the stadium . We attended the same game as a previous reviewer on fireworks night . Every employee we had interactions with were extremely friendly , even though I was wearing a Red Sox hat . We had a problem with one of our StubHub tickets but it was resolved quickly and with an apology .Like all sports events , food and drink prices are astronomical . We had a huge late lunch so we just had drinks and a Dodgers dog each .We purposely sat up high to get a great view of the mountains behind , but were also too late to get on to the field for the fireworks .As others have mentioned the only wart on the evening was getting out of the parking lot . I thought we were lucky because as we entered I noticed we were close to an exit . That exit however was unreachable from where we parked . Stupidly I started up the car and moved 2 car lengths into the line up . We then moved one car length in the next 45 minutes . We snuck around the far side and got out quickly after giving up on our line . It would really help out of town visitors to give more warning as to where your exit lane is headed . We had no choice of getting the freeway we wanted but at least got onto one that headed in the same general direction .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Skwiki
40,Every day is a good day for baseball.,"I'm a huge baseball fan and try to find time for a game wherever family vacations take us. I was initially worried about Dodger Stadium based on reviews and news from years past about thugs taking over the stadium and lack of security. Happily that seems to be a thing of the past. Our experience was as good as any stadium I've been to (12 major league stadiums and counting). We always felt safe inside the stadium and in the parking lot after the game. There were plenty of other families in our section as well. I'm guessing the new ownership was serious when they said they were going to clean it up. You definitely need a car to get to Dodger Stadium, it's not in an easy to get to neigbourhood from the Tourist zone like Angels Stadium in Anaheim is. Parking was quick and easy and only $10, however pay careful attention to where you park because signage is not the parking lot's strong point. Getting out and back to the freeway was also quick and easy. ***I'd go to the Dodgers website and plan your route before you go, it was very helpful. Pay attention to where you are sitting because you cannot just go to any gate and go in to find your seat. Specific sections require entrance via specific gates. I didn't know this and we spent quite a bit of time finding the proper gate. Like the parking lot, signage into the Stadium is not a strong point. Once in, the experience was fantastic. Typical prices as other stadiums for food and drinks. But Dodger Stadium is not as progressive with the selection as some of the newer parks such as Seattle and San Francisco. The atmosphere was outstanding though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alhan10
30,Excellent evening out but,"I booked tickets to the Dodgers v Red Sox game in advance from UK and picked them up on the day which was all very simple and organised. On the Hotel recommendation we got a cab from Hollywood to the Stadium which was about $40. Be prepared for very expensive drinks and snacks...$50 on 2 beers, 3 cokes and 2 popcorn. Fireworks after the match were good but we were stopped from going on to the pitch when stewards considered that there were too many people out there. Waited in queue for cab for 90 minutes after the fireworks finished. Game last 2 hours....cab queue last 90 minutes! I'm not sure I would recommend driving as the traffic was horrendous so if you do choose to go be prepared for hassle getting away from the ground. Certainly worth a trip and if it weren't for the Cab queue and the cost of food it would have got an excellent rating.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/U7300NWmichaels
50,Great Saturday afternoon.,"Just visited the Dodger Stadium and it's a great way to spend a Saturday afternoon. Seated on the right field stands, with all you can eat hotdogs, nachos, popcorn, peanuts and soda! Great value for about USD 50. No lines to get to the stadium or to enter it. Everything was clean, the crowd was great, we had a lot of fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/felipejendiroba
40,"Good stadium, parking can cause problems....","The stadium is in good shape, the seats are normal size (I'm 6' 2"" tall and had no problems), and the staff are friendly.Two problems, there were two large Merch stores at either side of the stadium and smaller ones within the structure. I was looking for a certain jersey but was told that the small selection they had on display was all they had left. It was a dismal selection available and not something I've seen at a major league stadium before. Quite disappointing.Secondly, We got there early so parking wasn't a problem. But trying to leave is quite a different story. As the majority of fans drive to the stadium, at the end of the game cars are going in each direction and exits aren't clearly marked. If we didn't have GPS, we'd probably still be driving around.Still, we enjoyed the experience and will be back when in LA again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JGilleese
50,Beautiful stadium,"I love Dodger stadium. This was my husbands first game at a MLB park other than Citizen's Bank Park in Philly and he was really impressed. Even though it's now one of the oldest stadiums in baseball they have managed to modernize it. Situated in Chavez Ravine, it's a beautiful location with the mountains in the background and palm trees all around. Sit on the first base side to get a sunset view for evening games.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/musclegirl68
50,Go for a game!,"Great to see the Dodgers beat the Mets 4-2, great atmosphere in a ballpark full of history. Fans were all great and foods like every other ballpark, expensive and average.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jamez870
50,Great value,Great tour and value. Lots of free parking for the tour. I do think it would help if there was more signage leading you into the park. No complaints with the tour. Even if you are not a baseball fan you will enjoy the tour.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sav4you
50,Real Madrid soccer game at Dodger Stadium,"First time I had been to Dodger Stadium and it was for a soccer game, not a baseball game. Staff at the stadium was very helpful. The NY pizza was wonderful! Didn't have room to try a hot dog! We went to each level and the top deck was great.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KR517
40,"If you have some time, you should spend it at the Dodger's stadium, watching a game","We went to see the match between the Dodger's and the Tampa Bay Rays. It took the Dodgers four hours to win the game, but we liked to watch it! Unfortunately, the fireworks were cancelled, due to the ling duration of the match (and neighbourhoodcurfew) nevertheless, we enjoyed it and felt like Americans, wearing Dodgers tshirts!If you have time, watch a match, BUT be sure you don't pay too much for the tickets. Just search on the internet, we bought 4 tickets and paid 10 dollar each! Despite the fact that we were seated quite near the top kf the stadium, we were able to watch the match.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Foxfamily4
40,"Odd place for soccer games, but good facility","Went to the International Champion's Cup doubleheader. The stadium itself was well-maintained, though the age is apparent. Stayed clean through both games, though it was quite congested in the narrow passageway between concessions, souveiner stands, and the restrooms.Everyone seemed to have a good time, especially once the LA Galaxy supporters started chanting. Only two real complaints: 1) the field was slanted towards one side rather than centered 2) the line for taxis after the game was extremely long.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bloom25
10,Getting out after game,We went to the Dodgers-Yankee game on Jul 31. Everything went well except when we were trying to leave the parking lot. We were parked in General Parking and it took forever to get out. The entire parking lot turned into a zoo of cars to the point that we were at idle for a good 45 minutes before we could move. I recommend either leaving before the end of the game or killing sometime before.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Miguel120
50,Old Park Was a Pleasant Experience,"As a diehard baseball fan, I like to go to a ballgame if the home team is in town. We were lucky enough to see the Dodgers play the Cardinals. We wanted to see Shane Victorino play, as he was a former Phillies player (we're from Philly). It was easy getting to the stadium. There were people directing you to a parking spot. We parked in the general admissiion parking lot. We were directed to the stadium entrance. An usher gave us a pamphlet of the stadium, and marked off the entrance we came in. We went to our seats, which were in the lower level behind home plate. I was like a little kid in a candy shoppe. The employees and fans around us were very nice, Our usher suggested we take the elevator to the top of the stadium. We did, and what we saw was a breathtaking view of the valley. It was amazing. We walked all around the stadium and went to every level. I noticed that at every level there was an entrance, and a parking lot at each level. That was interesting. The game went 12 innings, but unfortunately, the home team lost. I would love to go back when the Phillies play the Dodgers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vaso815
50,Loved it !!! Old stadium but well kept,"I'm sorry, I have to say, every person has their own story. For us, going to the Yankees-Dodgers game was an awesome experience. We live in Vegas and waited long enough for a game that was worth driving 5 hours to watch, and this was it !!! First of all, I couldn't talk about traffic or parking in the stadium since we stayed at the super 8 motel just around the corner on sunset blvd. so we just walked to the stadium (5-10 min walk) and no parking drama. Then we went straight to our seats, everything clean, perfect, no problems, food is really expensive, that's true, but what you could expect. We really, really enjoy the game, the crowd was 99% dodgers fans, so, it was just amazing (we are dodgers fans, of course) we won 3-2 on a great game. Loved it !!! Really looking forward to the dodgers going to the world series (fingers crossed) so we could go again !!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SaraSandoval
20,Can't get there from anywhere!,"We been to a lot of ballparks and this is by far on the bottom of the list. They upgraded in the last year and it is still a dump.Food choices in Lodge area is Carl Jr's and Dodgers Dog. The worst hot dogs in a MLB stadium in my opinion. If you want something, get up and get it. The vendors come around maybe twice during 9 innings. No beer from vendors and no dogs. Just peanuts, pizza in a box and ice cream and cotton candy (about the size of an large ice cream cone).And traffic - no real mass transit to get in and a zoo to get out.From Santa Monica at 4:30 - 17 miles 2 1/2 hours.Next night from LA - 8 miles - almost 2 hours at 4pm!45 minutes to get out. Next time watch on TV.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LouM340
20,Nothing Special,There's nothing here that stands out or makes this stadium great. Scoreboards were behind our heads and hard to read look like they're from 1960's. Parking is a nightmare all the sections aren't numbered. Concessions are slow and not much to choose from. Souvenir shop way overpriced. Go once thats enough.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JMRow
10,Glad that I never have to go back.,"My son and I are making the stadium tour. This ranks very low on our list. The concourses are dark and dank, the scoreboards and video screens are old and outdated, and (as noted in several other reviews) the hometown fans are nasty. You do not want to wear anything other than Dodger gear or non-descript clothing to games. If you dare to wear clothing from any other team be prepared for the worst from the Dodger fans.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BillK427
40,Great ballpark,3rd oldest park in baseball. Very nice and clean. Different with it being really in its own valley. There is not advertisments everywhere so it gives it a very simple clean look. It is a top 10 park. Tours are well done.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelhR4757OG
40,A true American experience,"This is our 4th visit to a ball park( after the old Yankees,Fenway park and Tropicana @ Tampa) .We are from the UK and I have to admit other than the basics, I don't really understand it however I do love the experience and how patriotic the fans are.We are staying in studio city and thought about getting public transport but finally decided to drive which was no problem at all,getting in ,parking and getting out was a breeze.Will call for ticket master pick up was easy to.Im aware I'm on holiday and don't mind paying but my only gripe was $10.50 draught and $12.50 can beer..these prices are shocking.Disney is $8 I think....food is also limited and it appeared a lot of people brought their own..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RichH851
10,Don't waste your time or money!,"We went to a NY Yankees v. Dodgers game. My husband always wanted to see the stadium. We are Cubs fans, yeah I know.We bought preferred parking ($30 v. $10)and when we got to our assigned lot it was full. We asked an attendant where we should park he said he didn't know. We went to the next preferred lot and got the same story. We finally found parking but not in preferred.I waited in line to buy a beer and the salesperson told me they were warm and to go to another location or she could give me a cup of ice for a $12.50 can of beer.We got to our seats and stayed for 3 innings got for fear of the terrible traffic we encountered entering.I have never seen such rude fans. It was like a hockey game from the '70's. They even booed a toddler with a Yankees shirt. Also, I have never been to a venue where so any people were sitting in the wrong seats. At least 4 sets of people were asked to move to their correct seats.I'm sorry to say that I was very disappointed and would not recommend a dodgers game.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chicago1450
50,"If you're a Dodger fan and coming from out of town, you'll love it!","Make sure to have tickets handy ahead of arriving, otherwise you will be left out. The stadium is simply a great experience. Make sure you arrive early and no matter where you are coming from, take a good amount of time as the traffic is horrible. Bring $$ to spend some buying goodies at the all blue and white stores and hopefully the Dodgers will win. Staff at the stadium are nice. Been to several others and objectively (in my case for my being a fan of the specific team) the experience is definitely worthwhile.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EddyS777
40,First time,We enjoy going to different ballparks around the country. Dodger stadium was vey nice and we enjoyed the views of the mountains. Eating a dodger dog is a must! Getting there can be stressful as the night we went the game was sold out and it took us an hour to go the last mile - by car. The parking lot is huge and it is a bit of a walk. But the entire staff from parking lot attendants to the staff inside are all very nice and friendly. We felt very safe at all times and enjoyed taking in the game and cheering on Vince scully!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nriemen
50,Excellent Friday night entertainment.,We went to this Ball game because my teenage son wanted to go. We were unsure of whether the family would enjoy it. Were we wrong.. Great night out. We really enjoyed the atmosphere. People were extremely friendly and made us feel at home. We joined the crowd eating hotdogs and fries whilst listening to the commentary. The fireworks were an added bonus. Excellent end to a wonderful evening even though the Dodgers lost..,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PhilMcAvitty
30,Not my favorite stadium,"Parking lot very spread out; long walk to gates, including two sets of stairs. If you are unfamiliar with the stadium (as we are, from out of town), the signs are confusing as to where to enter. The stadium employees were nice and helpful though. Odd sections down the 3rd base side; even sections down the first base side. Food choices in the stadium very limited and very expensive compared to other ballparks we've been to across the country.The two jumbo screens in the outfield very colorful and informative, and I did like them. The fans were obviously loyal, and that made the game fun. But the stadium itself could use some updating. Seems very basic...not the caliber of a major league park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EBMDD
50,Great day at the Ball Game!,"My husband and two teenage boys had never attended at baseball game so it was quite a delight to find there was a game on while we were in town. We went to see the Dodgers Vs the Rockies. We just turned up on the day and purchased $16 tickets as they were the only ones left apart from some that there in the $100's. While we were up so high in the stands that we practically could get a nose bleed, it was well worth it. We could not see what was happening on the ground but the large screens helped that. Not that it would help as we had no idea how the game is played.All in all, a great experience as they know how to entertain a crowd. Just experiencing the game first hand was excellent.My biggest gripe was the overpriced food. Seriously, Theme parks who are notorious for overpriced food are not as expensive as the food at the stadium. So if you go, bring some food with you to help lighten the load of feeding two teenage boys!After the game, we were treated to a movie being screened on the big screens called 42. A fantastic surprise and we really loved the movie. (Go see it if you can, I highly recommend it).Biggest Tip - Do not forget to bring Sunscreen and a hat!!We are now converted LA Dodger fans!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pinki24
50,Really fun experience,"I got the chance to attend a Dodgers vs Giants game while I was in LA & would recommend it to anyone. Great atmosphere & lots of fun, even if you don't 100% understand the rules. Although food & drink is a bit pricey, the Dodgers merchandise is really reasonable & makes great souvenir gifts.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lrnnnn
30,Not the nicest stadium in the world,"Dodger stadium is pretty average compared to the newer stadiums in the US. It's sits high in the hills over Los Angeles so the views are nice, but unfortunately you can't see the city from inside the stadium. You've got to be outside the stadium to see the city skyline views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaryElle
50,good experience,"I recently went to a dodger with a lot of my friends. The stadium itself is really well equipped. I am very happy with them because they offer great discounts with large groups. My friends and I received 50% off our tickets plus an all you can eat offer in hot dogs, drinks and snacks. During the game there is a lot of interaction and games. Like the wave, dancing and clapping. Even though Dodgers lost the game I went to it was still awesome because there was a post game fire work show.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LuzElenaR_13
50,Our first game!,Coming from the UK this was our first game and what a game it was. Dodgers V San Fran! We had 8 inings of great entertainment where the Dodgers won after 3 hours of play with Kent catching the ball wining it for the them. From beginning to end we had great service from the members of staff and the home fans were so friendly to us. When we go back to LA we'll be sure to head there. The food and drinks were great with a good range of merchandise and we both got a free towel.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fonseca-Denning
10,Would not go again,"This was the worst stadium that I have been to both in terms of atmosphere, food and facilities. We were first turned away from parking as we were 5 minutes too early and were not allowed to wait - so ended up parking down the road for free. Even walking up the the Stadium entrance did not feel like usual. I always buy a baseball shirt from each ground but it was hard to find a decent shop in the ground - the only one I could find was very small. There appeared no choice of food in the ground and did not look appetising as to what was there. The staff were certainly not the most friendliest around. The toilet facilities were poor and the crowd were the worst I had encountered. I certainly wasn't hoping for a home win with fans like that and I am usually a neutral. If this had been my first ever baseball game, it would have been my last but thankfully that is not the case.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ElaineBruce

40,First MLB game,"Went to my first game with a group of 22 in the all you can eat pen. The food wasn't great but plentiful and the seats associated weren't the best. Nevertheless, we had a good experience. If I ever go to a baseball game again I'd only arrive just before the start not the hour earlier like we did. The game is far too slow and long for someone like me who doesn't understand the rules fully.Let's go Dodgers.....let's go!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Evertonian_1
40,Nice place; nice views,"If you're any kind of baseball fan, you will certainly need to make a trip to Dodger Stadium if near Los Angeles. A couple tips: you can park for free if you don't mind walking about 3/4 miles (up hill going in!). At the light on Elysian just before you enter the parking lot, turn left. You can park right there on the street about 1/4 mile down the road and walk back. It's a little bit of a hike, but you'll save money - and time, as the lot is jammed after the game. If you buy seats in the upper deck, you will be limited to that area, and won't be able to walk around downstairs. The views of the mountains are amazing. We sat in the far upper deck, but the seats were still okay for seeing the game. Concession pricing seemed reasonable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PhillyBob20
10,The worst so far,"This stadium is the bad old days. No public transportation and an hour in the car to get here. Once there, this is easily the least family friendly stadium that I have been to. Fans reminded me more of a football game crowd rather than baseball. Food was fine, but my stadium expectations are fairly low.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CannistraD
40,"Sad loss, but great stadium!","Visiting LA with our family from Texas and we were able to score good tickets to a Dodger v Phillies game.

30,New tv screens,"I'm from Pittsburgh but I used to live in East LA so I came back out here to visit my family and we all went to see a game. I liked the new bigtron LED screens they put in. The Dodger dawgs are a must cause they are better then ours in Pittsburgh. Wasn't at all dangerous like it used to 20 years ago. For people that read this review, if you never been to PNC Park Home of the Pittsburgh Pirates you can't even understand what a GREAT Ballpark is and that's why Pittsburgh's PNC Park is always ranked #1 year after year..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pittsburghersouth
50,So much fun!!!,"I'd never been to a baseball game before so thought I'd give it a try while in America. We had the best time ever. Aussie sport can learn a lot.

40,great place to watch a game,"We were in town on vacation and visited the old ballpark, as we like to do. I've been to most of the stadiums in the country, and there are quite a few that I like better than this one, so I can't give it 5 stars, but it is a great place to watch a game. I was worried that it might be a bit too worn due to it's age, but it actually stayed pretty modern with the HD-scoreboards beyond the outfield... and it was relatively clean. We found great, reasonably-priced field seats down the right-field line and really loved having a long bar table in front of us (with a purse hook that my girlfriend couldn't stop raving about!). The fans weren't the friendliest or most-involved in the game (and we did NOT like that this one of the few stadiums that does not allow any signs in at all), but overall we really enjoyed the game. Not much of a better way to enjoy a beautiful summer evening than kicking back with some baseball, a large beer, and a delicious Dodger Dog.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Terpdrew
50,"Great Game, Great Tour","Tour was fantastic. We had toured Angels Stadium a few days earlier (see my review). At Angels the manager could not accommodate our time request. We called before the tour and spoke with the tour guide, Ralph, who to be sure we were not taking the ride there for no reason, like Angels Stadium. Ralph stated. ""Anyone who comes three thousand miles to see our park, we will make room for""....and he did. He is an excellent tour guide. Very knowledgable about the park. Learned about alot of history in the park itself that we would have never known if we did not take the tour. Ralph gave us lots of time for photos. Behind the scenes park is beautiful. Well worth the time. The game was great. Staff is very friendly and will take your photo is asked. Unlike New York, we tried to tip the lady who seated us and she refused. Food is very good too. I will always be a Mets fan,but I have to say, Dodger Stadium is a class act. Go and enjoy.......don't forget to take a picture in the stadium with the Hollywood sign behind you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WeLoveTraveling23
50,Take me out to the ball game.,"Arrived from UK wide awake and decided to go to see The Dodgers as we were staying nearby.This was on the Friday of Memorial Day weekend, arrived at the stadium before the start of the game and purchased tickets easily and just behind first base. Loved al the pre game build up with bringing on veterans. As an English person who has only been to one game before I can honestly say the atmosphere was very friendly, relaxed and great to see the patriotism. Loved the way they get the crowd envied when they go to commercials and Kiss Cam (camera crew walk around in the crowds and this goes out on the big screen). Seventh innings stretch the crowd all join in a sing song on this particular night the game was followed by firework display which you can go on the pitch to watch. I highly recommend you take in a game and you do not need to be a baseball lover to enjoy. Kids will love it and enjoy a Dodgers Dog!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barbarapagesmith
50,Dodger Stadium: An American Treasure,"As a visitor to Los Angeles, my wife and I are not particularly fans of the Los Angeles Dodgers. that being said, we felt that, as baseball fans, we should take the opportunity to catch a game at Dodger Stadium while in town, and we're so glad that we did! The stadium looks great, and has held up well after 55 years. It's obvious the the Dodgers organization maintains the park extremely well, and has invested in certain upgrades like the LCD scoreboards and concession areas. The park is perfect for Southern California, and we were very happy with our ""cheap seats"" in Section 17. An added bonus was the Friday Night Fireworks. A great night - every baseball fan should attend at least one game in this iconic ballpark. PS The Cardinals crushed the Dodgers on this night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pssunrisefl
40,"Very interesting tours offered every day! Highly recommend it, even if you're not a Dodgers fan","We're in town to see our team play the Angels so we figured we'd visit the 3rd oldest ballpark (after Fenway and Wrigley), beautiful Dodger Stadium.We weren't interested in watching the last place Dodgers play (sorry, honestly we're on a budget and can't afford 2 MLB games in one week) so taking the $15 tour was the perfect alternative.What a great tour it was! We visited the press box, saw the corridor full of golden gloves and world championship trophies on the way to the clubhouse entrance. Went down to the field, sat in the dugout, relaxed in the padded luxury seats behind home plate, visited a suite. Learned a lot about Dodger history.Highly recommend this tour for baseball fans visiting LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Left-the-dog-at-home
40,Sun & Fun--baseball style,"open air baseball-wonderful to experiencesitting in the sunshine with family just watching how Dodger fans show how much they love being at the ballgame--family affair, all generations--fun to people watch",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mysterydogue
30,"Decent Stadium, Skip the All-You-Can-Eat Section","During our vacations we like to hit up the local ballparks and catch a game if we can. We attended a Dodgers-Cardinals game at Dodger Stadium last week and were somewhat underwhelmed.We had tickets in the right field pavilion, which includes an all-you-can-eat selection of hot dogs, popcorn, peanuts, soda, and nachos. The view was very good for bleacher seats, but I wouldn't do the all-you-can-eat section again - the food is pretty low quality and didn't taste all that great. Also, we generally like to walk around the stadium to taken in all the unique aspects of each park, but we weren't able to do that here because of the how the stadium is separated into different sections. There were a number of statues/plaques outside the stadium to look at, however.Getting into the parking lot is ridiculous due to a log jam of traffic, but we were able to get out pretty quickly by leaving after the 8th inning (Dodgers were down 10-0).Overall, it's neat to be in a place where so much history has occurred, but if you can only hit up one stadium in southern California, make it Petco Park in San Diego.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/V7585ACandyw
40,"Club level seats, section 42","Dodger stadium is one of baseball's great stadiums. We bought club level seats (BL 42) which grant you access to a private dining area which serves all you can eat dodger dogs, hot entrees, non-alcoholic beverages, salted peanuts, coffee, soft drinks, cookies, fresh fruit, salads, and soft serve. You can dine in or take the food with you to your seats. The club level seats have beverage and food service if you dont feel like getting up. I found all the staff at Dodger stadium to be extremely helpful and friendly. If you go to a Friday night game, stay for the fireworks after the game....you are allowed on to the field and its a great show. We took taxis, and found no problems getting to or out of the stadium after the game. Would definitely go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Coolcanuck67
50,Great views from the top deck,"I don't get to baseball games very often (I live in Las Vegas) but I wanted to make at least one sojourn this year to see the Dodgers. We could only afford the cheap seats in the the fifth deck that runs behind home plate (tix were $25), but it was great. From that vantage point you get a great view of the hills behind the stadium and since you are straight up behind home plate you are not that far from the action on the diamond.We had no problem getting out after the game (surprisingly) despite an attendance of 50k. But it probably helped parking behind the stadium near the exits.The only downside is that we spent more on food than we did on the tickets. I wish they could manage to lower the prices, though I know that will never happen. But it won't deter me from going to a game again. It was great.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mauiwolf
10,bad experience,"Dodgers are not prepared for electronic tickets that could be scanned from I-phone, poor service and attitude from food vendors. horrible way to spend a day at ballpark with poor food choices. harassed in parking lot about what we were drinking inside our own vehicle. Stadium is a cool old stadium. you can get popcorn , but NO salt for it. hot dogs are premade even though you have allergies from what is on there and they won't make one fresh for you. Won't be back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JayB386
50,Taking in the Dodgers in style,"As a long-time Dodger fan, I always thought that the Stadium Club was a members-only enclave for the well-heeled and privileged. Wrong! We rolled into the club on the second level of the right field area, asked for a table and were told it would be a ten-minute wait. Bingo! The club is sleek and contemporary with a lively bar area and a great buffet for $36. You can dine inside, or of you're lucky, get one of the outdoor tables overlooking the game. The service and food is first-rate and plenty of monitors keep you up to date on the action below. Service ends at 9 p.m. and we didn't make it to our seats until the seventh inning. It's a nice break from fabled Dodger Dogs and beer!.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnecheveste
50,Great Way to Spend a Sunday!!!,I went to Dodger Stadium on Sunday before Memorial Day. Taking into consideration the cost of the tickets and the ability to bring in your own food the cost can't be beat when it comes to family entertainment!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/etienne1010
40,Love Dodger Stadium!,Just went to yesterday's game vs the Cardinals and the stadium was live and electric. Love it when the stadium has that playoff feel to it. Truly a landmark to the Los Angeles area and is a must see if in town for only a couple days. Only downfall is to beware of parking because it can take you anywhere from 1-2hrs to exit the stadium on a day of a sold out game.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kobe87
20,Rather Watch on TV,"Loved to attend games - then they started making changes years ago, not just to pricing. We have not been back since. Would not rather watch on tv. We are going in June to San Diego and paying $60+ per ticket to see the Padres, but would not think of giving Dodger Stadium that much for a ticket.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlendaleGirl1
50,Great fun for everyone!,"Dodger Stadium is a great place to go...the stadium is bright and clean, tons of security everywhere, great food--ate in the dugout club and dined on salmon, grilled veggies and of course the frozen yogurt with tons of sprinkles and chopped nuts....the giveaways seem more frequent also...last night was Matt Kemp bobble head night--what's not to like?Takes a bit to get out of the parking lot, but it IS LA after all and we are all trying to get on the same freeway at the same time, but no problems.Even tho the stadium is not new, it is sure in great shape and beckons the baseball fan no matter what age! Enjoy! And...go BLUE!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/N1825ZNjuliev
40,Go Dodgers,"After many years of not going to a baseball game , and the recent brawl at Dodger Stadium , I went for the first time last season ....it was worth it ! The security has been beefed up considerably , and the food , although extremely expensive , wasn't that bad for a ball park . All and all , a rather expensive afternoon of entertainment , but was a worthwhile way to pass a great sunny California afternoon ! Now if we can just get these Dodgers out of their slump !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pizzalover270
40,Small tight seating,"First time back in about 20 years, got a free dodger bag-a plus, clean bathrooms, crossing guards, lines not too long, very nice hospitality personel. Someone bumped my friend and spilled his beer, EXPENSIVE, but they did replace it. Negatives seats way too small and cramped no one could pass by unless everyone from the seat walked out to the walkway stairs, so anytime someone had to use the restroom we all had to get up it got so repeatitive we starting making a game out of it.I did feel safe, maybe a little too safe, police were everywhere.All in all somewhat expensive drank some beer spent alot and learned to love CRUZZZZZZ.ID GO BACK AGAIN",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lizziwizzi90
40,Baseball Treasure; fan experience needs some improvement,"Dodger Stadium is a baseball classic (it's in it's 52nd season in the 2013 baseball season) and the design is timeless and is a classic. The new video scoreboards are wonderful, and the stats that they show in game are great. A very nice up to date addition to a great baseball facility.However, the fan experience needs a bit of improvement. In particular, the Dodgers need to make it easier for fans to move between levels of the stadium, particularly from ""up"" to ""down."" A concourse encircling the whole park - which I realize would be a massive investment and change the Pavilions environment (perhaps for the better) - but I believe could be done - would bring the park truly up to date. It would also help if there were easier access to the Reserved and Top Deck seats from the General Parking lots behind left and right field.I will have to say the Dodger Dog may be famous but it is totally overrated.On the whole, I was impressed with how well traffic flowed into and out of the parking lots, although driving up I-5 from Anaheim to attend a midweek 7:10 pm start game was a challenge.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jbtexas
40,Dodgers Vs. Padres,One of the last remaining old stadiums in baseball. It was a good experience only it took forever to find food that wasn't a hot dog - my only complaint. Parking at the stadium was quick and relatively cheap.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/foleyk5
50,Go Dodgers!!,"Let's go Dodgers!!!There are many entrances to get here. The weird thing about Dodgers Stadium is that it's on a hill so there's all this weaving and the parking people tell you where to park AND because of them parking is now $15!! -_-When you're trying to get to your section (depending on where you parked) you have to go through the crowd of people and may end up actually getting lost along the way.I don't have kids, but sometimes I feel bad for the parents that bring them because it IS a sporting event and a lot of people use inappropriate language so somethings are bound to be said and done. Just be aware of that if you're a parent wanting to take your kids there.They serve different kinds of food depending where you sit. If you're up on the reserve/lower reserved side get GARLIC FRIES, ULTIMATE NACHOS, and of course a Dodger dog.Over all, I love summer nights watching Dodgers and #16!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kisssmee
40,"Good, but LA Offer's Better","I went to the LA Dodgers/San Diego Padres game last year (2012) in June. It was a great experience as I had never been to a Dodger's game. I'm not a big baseball fan, but I just wanted to try something new in Los Angeles. There were a few factors that probably affected my ""ok"" perception of the game and venue. 1. I failed to realize I needed to bring sunscreen. 2. The Dodger's weren't playing a big market team like the Yankees. 3. It was the middle of summer (HOT HOT HOT!!). Had it been a little cooler and a big market opponent I probably would have loved it.I did however make sure I ate before I went. I wasn't spending my cash on the world famous ""Dodger Dog."" I brought world famous snacks with me. In my opinion, being at Dodger Stadium is more of an experience than the actual game. The Dodgers aren't the Lakers by any means. For some, it would be an enjoyable evening, but for me I've found better things to do in Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Maddindividual
50,Best seats ever !!!,"A must grab , the best seats ever in between third base & home base. Up close and personal . A quick walk to bathrooms and lounge..The players are friendly and cute:) I wouldn't want to seat anywhere else. But for a night game bring your Dodger hoodie and Dodge wind breaker. Day games just come relaxed in summer attire and have a cold drink to wash down your Dodger dogs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Graybarnett
40,Take me out to a ball game!,"We decided to go to a Dodger game while in California. It was actually quite fun. The only thing that wasn’t fun was when it started getting cold. It was a really big stadium. The food and drinks however, are severely overpriced and not worth it. Bring blankets (if you go to a night game) bring sunscreen (if you go to a day game) and also, bring a camera so you can take pictures!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ihearttraveling01
20,"Stadium tour--cool history, way too crowded","We are in the process of visiting all of the ballparks in the country and that was the reason for this stadium tour on March 30. We have done several other stadium tours and this was the most disappointing of them all. The history of the ballpark and getting to see the ballpark was fantastic. However, this tour was very disorganized and more limited than other stadium tours and at $15/person was more expensive than many others. The tour was supposed to START at 11:30. At that time there was a large group of people still wandering around with no clear directions then our tour guide showed up and started getting people into groups-those who already had tickets were in one group and those who didn't were in another. Why this was just being done at 11:30 baffled me. There were at least 20 people who didn't have tickets yet and she went to each of them and took cash payment, made change, etc. which took a while. Then she went to the rest of us to see our tickets. There were about 75 people in the group. We started at least 20 minutes late.Once the tour started just trying to keep up and see all the sights and hear what she was saying was a challenge. This group was way too big. Our guide said there were other staff members who did the tours. Why wasn't this group divided up when she noticed it was so big? Why not start on time and get tickets taken care of BEFORE the START time of 11:30?To get from place to place she had us use the elevators rather than the stairs. The elevators took at least (no exaggeration) nearly 10 minutes to come and there was only one working and with our group being big it took 3 elevators to get us to where we needed to be so it took 30 minutes of just standing and waiting to get the group together again. When the tour was over and people were trying to take the elevators back up (because the guide said she didn't know if the stairs were unlocked) our group got stuck on an elevator for several minutes. Finally we got off and decided we WERE going to get out of this park using a staircase and not those outdated elevators. We found stairs that were unlocked and made our way out. I understand this is an older ballpark but certainly they can replace the elevators?!? Frustrating and disorganized tour.The other crazy thing...the Dodgers were hosting a game in TWO days and there was construction, landscaping, cleaning, etc. going on all over the ballpark. Couldn't figure out why you would wait until the absolute last minute to get this stuff done. Literally there were hundreds of flowers they were trying to plant for a game that was in 2 days. LA has perfect weather...this should have been done weeks before. There were open paint cans all over, electrical work being done, etc. The bathrooms were filthy. No doubt they hadn't been cleaned since the previous fall and they were working on cleaning them but again, wouldn't you do this more than 48 hours before hosting a home opener?Interesting ballpark to see but management really needs to step it up and get things way more organized. I can't imagine what this place would be like on game day. The facility couldn't handle our group of 75 well at all. What about the thousands of people who come here on a game day???",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/593MichelleB
30,NOT INTO BASEBALL AND NOT REAL GREAT TO WATCH A CONCERT IN,"Well first off, I am really not into baseball, though a game every now and again can be fun. I will never watch a concert at DS again. I remember way back in time when I watched the David Bowie and Souxie and the Banshee's concert at the DS and it was like watching flies on poo from about a quarter of a mile away.. Eh!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rejuvinateyrslf
40,Great changes to an already great stadium.,The recent changes to the stadium appear minor (I know they were not) have given the stadium the familiar feeling of many years ago. It is more open and the Dodgervision screens make following the game much easier.The parts I didn't appreciate are that you must request a cardboard tray for your pricey Dodger dog and beer and they have changed the TP in the bathrooms to something close to cardboard/sandpaper.I'll go back again but it is a very expensive day at the ballpark when you add up everything.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sixxmom
50,Classic baseball part where you see Hollywood Stars.,"My son and I have been to 20 MLB baseball stadiums. Dodger Stadium is up there with Fenway, Wrigley and the Old NY stadium.

40,Great show,"My family and I are new to the USA and this was our first experience of a ""ball game"" but we found the stadium well thought out, with easy parking, access, and great views from anywhere within the stadium.It was good fun and the whole family had a great night out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SteveL403
40,A plethora of blue.....,"On a mission to attempt to check off my bucket list of baseball stadiums, The Dodgers vs SF Giants with their first series of the 2013 season, seemed fitting since I am an avid Giants fan.....loaded up the station wagon and off we went, ""we"" being my best friend, who is an avid Dodger fan. Driving into the parking lot was easy, however exiting the same lot was a ton more challenging. Entrance into the stadium was easily accessible to the parking lot and our seats were in what is coined ""Left Field Pavilion"", section 307, row B, seats 17 and 18, they were perfectly located, near those who are hungry, thirsty, and needing a potty. So a quick few steps up and we were in our seats, anticipating an evening of great ball. The stadium is the second largest in the MLB and one of the eldest, they have done some updates, however the stadium is still in need of more, but don't let that discourage you, although it may have been lacking some of the more ""pretty"" of newer stadiums, this stadium had ""baseball"" oozing out of its seats, the energy was alive, and the swarms of blue were everywhere, I looked like an orange beacon of light in the middle of blue, I had peanuts tossed at me, a Dodger hat placed on top of my head, and whenever I stood up to cheer or leave my seat, the surrounding Dodger fans would chant, ""take it off, take it off"", in reference to removing my orange and black attire, for which I would never oblige, (smile), needless to say, the Giants won, the stadium exuded America's favorite pastime and the Dodger fans were jovial and respectful, just as I was to them. I say all this to encourage those who are fellow fans of the Giants and have become leery of attending a game at Dodger Stadium since the Bryan Stow incident, don't be, go out and watch a game of ball, played by two of the longest standing rivals in the MLB.....you won't regret it! Go Giants! :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/heidimello
40,Fun Experience,"I'm a Giants fan but happen to be in So. Cal. during the Dodgers/Giants opening day series. We caught the last game on a Wednesday night of the 3-game series. We enjoyed our seats in Sec. 36FD, Row B which was just behind the seats with counters on the field level. We enjoyed rooting for the Giants without getting hassled. Getting to the stadium was horrific as we sat in rush hour traffic for 2.5 hours which should have only taken 30 minutes. It was rush hour all the way to the parking space! General Parking only cost $10 which is a steal compared to the $30 we pay at AT&T Park, and where we parked was even closer to where we park at AT&T. So getting there was a bear, but leaving the lot wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. Didn't get a chance to walk around the stadium. Although it's an old stadium, it looks nice, and apparently they spent millions on improvements.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ventinonfatlatte

20,I dont understand the good reviews.,I purchased leftfield bleacher seats and do not reccomend this to anyone unless you want to just go and hope to catch a ball in batting practice. The bench seating was pathetic and looked like the wood used was 40 years old and painted a hundred times. My back was killing me by the end of the game. You are like an inmate in this section as you may not accesss any other part of the stadium. I am a Mets fan and was sitting next to Phillies fans and we both coudnt believe how bad this section was. Yes we may be spoiled by new stadiums but with the dodgers being a pretty good franchise fan base wise you would think they could do more fot the fan experience. It was by far the worst stadium I went to out of the 4 California teams I went to see on my West Coast trip and maybe one of the least appealing I have been to in general.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MitchAng

We saw the World Series trophy and the home plate from Ebbets Field from when the Dodgers were playing in Brooklyn, NY. and many other baseball memorablia.The tour cost 15$ and the parking is free.Only disappointment... the Dodgers Store... maybe because the season was ending soon but the choice was limited.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ben0844

I paid $125 for right field baseline tickets which included access to the club section restaurant which provided free food and non-alcoholic beverages. The restaurant was great; however, the seats were terrible despite being in the front row and within inches of the field! The reason being the angle of the seats. My box had six seats at a slight angle. I was in seat six which seemed awesome at first-until the other five people sat down and blocked my view entirely! Unreal.So either sit in the first three seats OR spend $60 and sit in the next section higher (which I did the next night) for an unobstructed view.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cincygumdoc
30,Dodgers beat the Phillies . . . . .,"Good game, Dodgers won, food was average, soft drinks were less than average quality [ typical ], the Dodger Employees could be a little more pleasant. Most that we had the opportunity to interact with acted like they didn't want to be there. Bottom line, Dodgers beat the Phillies.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kukui_Aloha
50,Great Baseball Venue,"You would never know that Dodger Stadium is the third oldest stadium in MLB. It is as spotless as the day it opened in 1962. It is well maintained, and is a tribute to private enterprise, as one of the few major sports venues owned by the team it serves.The view of the San Gabriel mountains over the center field fence is worth the hefty price of admission. The ushers are polite and friendly. Roger is still tossing bags of peanuts behind the back with pinpoint accuracy.The only negatives were the beer selection and price. The stand near our seats had Samuel Adams the first day, but it was ""broken"" the rest of the four-game series. Oh, yeah, and getting out in traffic after the game is a hassle.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PhillipB328
50,Oldy but a great,"Access to stadium by car or by metro is well organized and easy to get to. Stadium itself is an older one but has all the ingredients for a great experience. Every seat in the stadium has a great view of the field. Food prices high (not unlike many other baseball stadiums) however you can bring in your own bottled drinks (ie) water. Best deal - the bleacher seats... ticket price includes all you can eat buffet of Dodger dogs, popcorn, nacho and cheese sauce, peanuts and soda fountain drinks. What more could you ask for at a baseball game!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Familyfun1_12
50,great game!,For 4th of July they did great at making it feel like 4th of July at a baseball game! we arrived on motorcycle and all the emplyees were very helpful giving us directions to are next location.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShirinT
30,"Dodgers Stadium isn't terrible, but it is unorganized.","My friend and I, have been to many baseball stadiums since we started our goal of visiting every stadium about 10 years ago. Dodgers stadium has this dumb rule of not opening the parking lot until 2 hours before the game, mostly because they don't want any tailgating, so you have to wait in a line of cars, just to park. I was happy that the parking was cheap at only $10.00. Then, we made our way to our seats, and after about 5 minutes we were approached by an usher. Although he was friendly, he questioned how we circumvented security and got to our seats; we politely told him that we walked by 3 employees who basically guided us to our seats. The game started at 6:15, and it was now around 4:45? I don't get it. The food lines are out of control, you waste so much tof the game waiting to get your food. Try should have a separate stand for ice cream/dessert. On the positive side we didn't see any rude fans or fights.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NYPAUL
40,Go Dodgers,"Dodger Stadium is an icon in the LA area. Even if you are not a baseball fan, going to a game here is a fun experiences. Don't forget the Dodger dogs!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Up4aTrip
50,Go Blue!,Even before i lived in Califorina I was a Dodger fan and now to finally live in the city where my favorite team plays is great! I have a season ticket pacakge and look forward to every game. This is one of few remaining older stadiums - my only hope is that they refresh what exists and don't tear down this great piece of baseball history!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulahonee
50,Take Me Out to the Ball Game PLEASE,"Dodger games are part of the LA experience! The stadium is a gem. $10 parking, yes! Dodger Dog still right up there with Foie Gras. You will have to break the piggy bank to eat & drink, but soak up the reality that is Dodger Stadium and RELAX! Scream or sit back, jump up, do the WAVE....hit a beach ball, sing along during the 7th inning stretch. Just remember that after the game, you are bound to be in a traffic jam, but turn on AM 570 Fox Sports LA and listen to the post game remarks. Or turn up the jams....either way, win or lose....You will have a great night (or afternoon) at Dodger Stadium.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Naninofro

50,A beautiful place to watch a game,"One of the classic baseball stadiums in America. And now they have bought a team - even better. Yes, it has an outmoded scoreboard and graphics. But it's nice & old school. Easy to get to from all over LA. Buy your seats on stubhub - we had field level for $25/each!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BobField
50,You can't really get more classic,"It's Time for Dodger Baseball! the 50 year old ballpark is still one of the best places to catch a game in the entire league, and now that Magic and friends own the team, the games are bound to be even more exciting! And while everyone will tell you that a Dodger Dog is a must, myself included, a chocolate malt in the 5th inning has hit the spot for me for the past 30 years.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cbucka
20,Relic or just plain old? You be the judge...,It’s not news this stadium is older than dirt and it shows. Get nostalgic all you want but that still doesn’t make up for this concrete monstrosity. Took the family to see the Dodgers and we had a good time. But the stadium is old and the food is expensive. You also have to pay $10 for parking and it takes over an hour to get out of the parking lot after the game. I don’t know why they don’t spend the money to update this relic.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NaomiBTravelin

40,"Great fans, so-so park","Went to all three southern California parks this trip and Dodger stadium was our last stop. We're on a mission to visit all of the ballparks and always try and arrive early to see BP and any pre-game activities. Arrived at 4:40 for a 7pm game...turned away from even parking in the lot. They finaly let us in to park at 5:30 and caught a little bit of the Giants BP. Very little going on around the park prior to the game.The stadium looks like a typical 60s/70s ballpark. Thankfully most of those parks are gone. Dodgers stadium is not what I would consider appealing to the eye. The park is not integrated into the city like many of the newer facilities.They never announced the game's attendance, but I would estimate it was around 45,000. BIG place, I think it holds about 55,000.The staff at the park were helpful and friendly. Food was average priced for most ball parks and we were pleasantly surprised at the size of the Dodger dogs. The fans we spoke with were very knowledgeable of their team and most of the crowd was very into the game. The Dodgers/Giants rivalry is fun to watch and we were pleased with the fun ribbing that took place between the fans of the two teams. There seemed to be plenty of security around to make sure things didn't get out of hand. One thing we noticed was that if you want a beer, you need to go to a concession stand, they don't sell at your seat. When leaving we seemed to walk forever to find the exit. Once we got to the car, we got out farly quickly when you consider the size of the crowd.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DougC281
50,Dodger Stadium Hints UPDATE,"I want to update my hints for parking at Dodger Stadium. In my first review I mentioned my parking recommendation, but neglected to specify which lot. If you enter from the Sunset Blvd. entrance, stay to the left and park in Lot 1. It is a bit of a walk to the stadium, but exiting after the game is easy as you leave Lot 1 onto the Sunset Blvd., the same as you entered. When you get to Sunset Blvd., you can go either left or right. Good luck!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ZumaDawg
40,Catch a Game,"Went to a Dodger-Phillies game & yes, our Phillies won, which was amazing this season!!! Drive to the stadium was easy with easy access to parking within walking distance of the stadium, which can be a bit far for some. There is handicapped parking if you should need it. The fans there were nice & good sports--though we wore our Phillies gear & of course, cheered for the Phillies! A fan next to us told us to go to the very top of the stadium, which is a bit confusing---up an escalator, then up an elevator, & so on---but the view of L.A. & the overview of the stadium from above were great as she told us!!! Food is a bit pricey--but guess you get that in most major league stadiums---fyi you can bring in your own bottled water or soft drinks in plastic, sealed bottles & food too---look at their site or call the stadium for info---save $ with drinks by bringing your own in!!! Upon exiting the stadium, it was very well done with security & staff around to guide drivers. Definitely recommended!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PAtraveler109
40,Catch a Dodger game if you can,We had a great time going to Dodger Stadium for a game. The views of LA from the upper parking lot are outstanding. The Dodgers are celebrating the 50th year of the stadium.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/APBowen
40,home run!,"Awesome experience. I live in LA and go to Dodger games often. My last experience was great as across the isle, a family from what I am gong to guess was Finland, one of two daughters caught a foul ball. Her Dad captured the whole experience on video and she was sooooo excited. Great beer choices to enjoy with a Dodger dog of course.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/heidisb
30,Very Dated & Confusing.,"I'm sure that if you are an Angelino, and go to Dodger games on a regular basis, you will eventually figure the place out. But for the tourist-visitor this is one confusing place.A tip: We took public transit (such as it is) to the stadium. Because the stadium is surrounded by parking in all directions it's very easy to get confused as to where you need to go where the game is over. I took a photo of my entry gate on my iPhone, and when the game was over I was able to show the picture to various staff and say ""How do I get HERE?"" The identification of the gates and entrances (Gate 6, etc) is non-existant out in the parking areas, so you need a plan to figure out how you will get to the right place to catch the bus that brought you there.There is a lot of very helpful staff that will direct you to your seat, and they're needed! Finding our seat was an over-the-hill-and-through-the-dale experience. The interior of the stadium is dated, a bit neglected and lacking in the open concourse feeling that you will find at newer parks like Safeco Field in Seattle.Another tip. Eat a big meal before you go to the game! Seriously. The food service windows have their own finance department (not really, but it seems that way) and the prices at Dodger Stadium are - well - shameful.The baseball experience IS good, and the iconic Dodger signs remind you where you are. If you had a car it might be easier to visit Dodger Stadium, but if you're using transit it's a LONG walk from the drop-off point to the stadium.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/air4ce
40,Family tour of the stadium,"Dodger Stadium is old but still awesome. We took the early tour which is advised as the later one gets crowded. I learned a lot of information I didn't know and was able to see some really cool memorabilia from the Dodgers in Brooklyn and LA. If you have a kid or grand-kid who would like to see as many stadiums as possible,I would recommend at least taking the tour, it was worth the cost and your time also.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ducka62
40,Love the mid-century California style; dislike the expensive food,"We flew to LA from Chicago for the Dodgers-Cubs series. The parking is easy - you are directed where to park, it's really close to the stadium and there are huge signs to help you remember where your car is. The outside of the stadium looks like it is still in the 1950's - in a good way. The iconic Dodger logo is visible, along with mid century colors like burnt orange, turquoise, etc. There are tons of stands throughout the park selling everything from sushi to Dodger sports memorabilia (items that have been actually used in a Dodgers game). It was Star Trek night so Captain Kirk threw out the first ball. I really appreciated that the music and the PA was not as overwhelmingly loud as it is in other MLB parks. The stadium was very clean, including the rest rooms. The only thing that was surprising was the food. Dodger dogs are hot dogs that have the circumference of a Vienna sausage, but are long and skinny and overhang the bun. After I had finished it, I felt like I could have eaten about 3 more, because of how little meat was in it. There are actually 2 kinds: order the ""all beef"" Dodger Dog. If you don't specify, you get some kind of pork/beef conglomeration. Also, a beer at the stand (and not brought to your seat!) was $11. For a beer. Not a jumbo size cup, not a commemorative cup. Just for a beer. There are vendors in the stand, but they were mostly selling souvenirs (big foam fingers, cheerleader dolls, etc.) cotton candy, peanuts, Cracker Jack and that's about it. I saw one water/soda vendor all night. The sight lines were good, the fans were friendly, laid-back. It's a nice park; too bad the food is not the best.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zobie

40,One of the old classic ballparks . . . Love it!,"We watched the Dodgers vs. Cubs game, sat in the left field bleachers (section 305, row C) and I thought those were great seats for the price! The left field section doesn't get afternoon sun, but the right field side does. Our game started at 6:10 PM and it was perfect -- no sun in the eyes. We often get better seats, but because the weather is so warm and we were last minute in buying our tickets, we took a chance with the bleacher seats. I will do those again next year!!This is one of older ballparks, doesn't have a million things to do and see (and eat) with the kids like some of the newer ballparks like Phoenix, Detroit or San Fran, but it is a classic. I love the older parks. Get there early for batting practice, if you like that kind of thing, we were able to get a ball tossed up to us which absolutely made my husband's day!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rocsmom0304
50,must do,"We had Felix as our guide and believe me he is passionate about his job. He knows the history of the team. We could take pictures any where we wanted ,The place is amazing and the staff very friendly.Any sports fan woould love itand the price is great.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lb21162
40,fun,"live about an hour away - don't go as often as I'd like, but I do like the all you can eat and soda drinks for one price, sinse it is very expensive to visit this stadium...beer way over priced, but you need to visit at least once, it is a nice park",
50,Go Dodgers!!,"We actually travelled here in August 2010 but a bit slow on the review. This was our first trip to America, LA our first port of call and my husband and I really wanted to see a baseball game. We chose (by accident) a great night to go, we got a Matt Kemp bobble head, we bought Dodgers baseball caps, which we wear proudly and we follow their games at home now. the night we went they won against Colorado. We were actually staying in Santa Monica and the hotel recommended we go with a tour but that would have cost us over $700 and was out of our reach. It took us 2 hours by bus...there and back, but it was worth it. We never felt unsafe, either at the game or on public transport and people were always helpful if we asked questions. The lady at the ticket booth was very helpful, once she found out we had come from Australia she went out of her way to make sure we had the best seats for us and we were not rushed, even given the crowd waiting to purchase tickets. She placed us with other Dodgers fans, she recommended that be the way to go. We were so happy with our seats and the people around us included us in the celebrations when ever we scored, high fives etc, we had a blast. And I dont care what anyone says, for us, we had to have a Dodger Dog and some chips (which came in plastic Dodger bowls..awesome) and beers, as that is part of the experience for us. We know its expensive but now two years later we have that memory of watching the baseball with a Dodger dog and beer and we dont think about the price, it was just a fantastic memory and I have some great photos. As for people having a go at the state of the stadium etc, I have nothing to compare it to but nothing caught my eye in the negative, everyone is different. Anyway, we had a blast and I cant recommend it enough. Maybe look out for the family nights or something special that will bring in the crowds, as some games I have watched since were not so busy and therefore the atmosphere was a bit down. Loved it.",
40,Great Game,"wonderful seats and the view of the game was amazing, cant say much about the team but this was a great begining to the trip.",
50,Great day out for an overseas visitor.,"My son and I took in a game between the Dodgers and the Cardinals and had a great day out. Having never been to a ballgame before, this was a whole new experience for us. The locals certainly made us very welcome, and went out of their way to explain things to us that we knew little about. The atmosphere was exciting, and as it was a late afternoon game, it was good to see it played in bright sunshine, as well as the fading light of the early evening. It was also a bonus to witness a solar eclipse that hadn't occurred in Los Angeles for over 20 years. The Dodger Dogs were tasty, and drinks were very reasonably priced. All in all, we had a great day, and even became Dodgers fans!!",
40,Do I really need a title?,"It's a baseball stadium. If you like baseball, go. If you don't like baseball, then you probably won't like this place. We scalped tickets in the 2nd inning. They were 4 rows off the dugout and we paid $60 each. Seeing as Yankee Stadium is my ""home"" field, this was a bargain. Notes: Cell service in the stadium is spotty and Cab service after the games is practically non-existent.",

50,Old school charm,"Big older stadium. Perfect seats on the inexpensive side. 2o dollars third deck above 3rd base line, great view.

40,Cool old park,"I agree with everyone else - interesting park with a nice history and views of the mountains that needs some updating, public trans and an injection of cool. Security was good (we were out of town fans in our gear and never had any problem at all). Best advice - eat and drink before you go (unless you're the one driving, then don't drink too much). Dodger dogs have no purpose besides making Magic Johnson some money and the same can be said of $13.25 Tecate 24 oz cans. I learned my lesson with a lighter wallet, trying to save you the same.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/plecostamus

20,This place needs public transportation,"In our travels we try to go to a baseball game in the cities we visit, San Fran, Rockies, Yankees, Boston and our Hometown Chicago Cubs (White Sox are a minor league team in this house) We left our hotel 14 miles away it took us over 2 hours to get to the park, then park then the seating sections are vague, finally sat in our seats by 3rd inning... like everyone else does!!!! beautiful park and seating, terrible experience coming and going does not help the rating!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chifinn
30,Very nice stadium and the Dodger's WON!,"We had to fight traffic going in and out, but overall it was a great experience and worth the hassel. We had awesome seats between homeplate and first base in the loge section....can't go wrong there. The food was OK...the beer...way overpriced! Tailgate before you go in! LOL",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PamelaH922
30,A little let down,"Didn't realize we wouldn't be able to access the rest of the stadium. We sat in the left field bleachers and were disappointed to find out we couldn't walk around the rest of the stadium. We were very excited to go to a game at the stadium, but were a little let down by being contained in left field only. Beautiful views of the area from the parking lot. Left field fans were all friendly and rocked the wave around the stadium.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GregRas
50,One of the Better Stadium Tours I've Been On!,"The family took our tour of Dodger Stadium on June 29th, (we were a bit late in the all-day LA traffic, but our wonderful tour guide waited a few minutes for us!) and learned a great deal about the team, both Brooklyn and LA's versions, as well as a peek around where the great Vin Scully does his thing. The Dodgers teem with history, both good and bad, about baseball and relocation and such, and our tour guide did a great job explaining the circumstances surrounding the move and showed us pictures and memorabilia representing the Dodgers of yesterday and today. The park is one of the older ones in baseball, but the upkeep is great, and the fan experience is quite good. I know there has been a lot published about rowdy fans in California and the Giants - Dodgers rivalries getting ugly, but I never felt unsafe or threatened at the game as we rooted for the out-of-town team that night. I highly recommend a tour and a game at Dodger Stadium, it will be a cherished memory for a long time to come! And don't forget to get a Dodger Dog!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Marcngin

50,Dodger Stadium Hints,"I have been going to Dodger Stadium for over 40 years and I love the place. Here are some hints that will make your outing easier and more pleasurable. If going to day games or early evening games, order your seats on the left field side of the stadium. You will be most likely be sitting in the shade. Those aisles on the left field side end in odd numbers, ie, 3, 5, 7, 103, 203, 303, etc. The higher up the aisle you sit in day games, the more likely you are to be in shade, usually aisles M and up. When getting Dodger Dogs, find the stands that sell grilled dogs, they are much better. If you have good eyesight, sit in the top level. It is directly behind home plate as opposed to sitting way down the left or right field lines in reserved level. I love to park in the first lot on the left as you enter from the Sunset Blvd. entrance. They have changed the entrance location, but just enter wherever they want you to and head back towards the Sunset Blvd. entrance and park. They open that exit after game ends and you will be right there ready to go. Have fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ZumaDawg
40,Not a Dodger's Fan,"This was my first major league game, unless you count spring training, and it was fun. I was there with a group and we were treated very nicely. I enjoyed the game even though I wasn't really routing for either team. My only complaint is that we were there for the 4th of July and the fireworks were just ok. They were behind the scoreboard so they were hard to see. The nice thing was that they let us sit on the grass in the outfield and the kids I was with were pretty excited about that. Overall it was fun! The garlic fries were good!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dalzy
50,GOOOOO Dodgers!,"I love Dodgers Stadium because I was born and raised a Dodgers fan, but it isnt exactly the most luxurious ball park in America. If you are a visiting fan I would recommend the following:1) Go to a game on any Friday. Their Friday night fireworks show is great and you get to lay on the field after the game.2) Try a Dodgers Dog and the garlic fries are YUMMY!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sw33tmolly
50,"Safe, Friendly and Affordable!","Dodger employees are amazing. Every single employee we encountered was friendly and accommodating. The security workers were incredibly accommodating while we tried to get our friend through the line who was in a wheel chair. The concession stand servers were also patient and kind while waiting for kids to make up their minds etc. We sat in the pavilion and enjoyed the game. Our only mistake was sitting too far up in the left field pavilion to see the Dodger Vision big screen. Left field pavilion is fine, just stay below the break in the seats...not under the covered area. We were in rows P and Q and those were too high...Other than that, a great place to take kids. Plenty of security...we did not fear any crazy fans.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TS5395
50,Dodger Stadium Historical Tour,"My husband found out about the tour on our local news station and we were thrilled to try it out. It was about $15 per ticket and we got access to many parts of the stadium that we normally wouldn't have access to like the press box, dugout, luxury boxes, Dugout Club, and the field. Being able to step out on the field of Dodger Stadium was a dream of mine since my favorite uncle took me to Dodger Stadium almost 30 years ago. Our tour guide was a lot of fun and very knowledgeable about Dodgers history and it was very cool being able to go down into the depths of the stadium and see photos and memorabilia that you cannot see anywhere else. It was so worth the price of admission.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DodgersMom
50,Easily accessible and great atmosphere,"While not a big baseball fan (it took me a while to grasp the rules), the game was a really fun experience. Seats in 9TD for only $10 still offered great views of the game and look out for promotions (we were given free dodgers caps due to the stadium anniversary)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JRose91
50,Dodgers vs Reds (50th Anniversary of Dodger Stadium),"This was the highlight of my trip. It was the 4th ballpark I visit in the Major Leagues. This one was my favorite so far. Everything is well-organized. The Dodgers Express Bus, The Will Call booth, the Dodger Stadium concessions. I will remember this trip for a long time. I recommend it highly. Super Shuttle from LAX Airport was great also. Stayed at the Metro Plaza Hotel near Chinatown...great staff...great area in downtown Los Angeles. Close to Union Station. Union Station is simply fantastic and very secure. The Dodgers won both games 3 to 1 on Tuesday, July 3rd and on Wednesday July 4th, the Dodgers won 4 to 1. Overall, very historic, very well maintained. Los Angeles rules and Dodger Stadium is just Awesome! Chris, from Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChrisB566
40,A baseball fan's dream vacation,"If you ever find yourself in LA on the Fourth of July and if the Dodgers are in town and if you have even the slightest interest in baseball, head for Dodger Stadium for a night you won't ever forget. We were bursting with all-American pride even before the game began as the Dodger organization honored our military servicemen and women during the pre-game ceremony. Then, the Dodgers took the field and beat Cincinnati. Then, fans filed in orderly fashion onto the outfield, spread their blankets, and we all watched one of the best fireworks displays I have ever seen. It was truly a memorable evening.A few tips: First, take the Dodger Express to the game. While parking is plentiful, traffic leaving the game is horrible since, like many older venues in this city, the stadium is surrounded by residential communities with narrow streets. The Express buses leave Union Station 1.5 hours before game time; you can take any Metro line to Union Station and then follow the signs to the loading area for the game. You will pay to get to Union Station, but it's only $1.50 per person each way on the train, and the bus ride to the stadium is free with your Dodger ticket. The ride out is comfortable, but the ride back to Union Station is standing-room-only on every bus. Buses run every 30 minutes from the stadium back to Union Station during the game, so you can leave the game early to avoid the crowds. Buses are lined up and run for 45 minutes past the end of the game and any post-game entertainment (like the fireworks show).Second: Be prepared for lots of walking and many stairs, even outside the stands. This is one of the reasons I gave the stadium a Very Good rating. One of the folks in our party has knee trouble and the long flights of stairs were an unwelcome surprise.Third: Expect long lines at most of the restrooms. The Stadium was built 50 years ago, so the washrooms are smaller than what you may be accustomed to in newer parks.Fourth: We didn't find the dining options very appealing. Of course, our hometown ballpark is one of the newer ones, so we are used to baseball's version of fine dining. There may have been options around the park that we didn't find, but by the time we made it to our Reserve section seats, one of us was too tired to walk much further in search of something more than Dodger dogs and nachos.Finally, all this aside, you simply can't beat a cool evening of baseball with a view of the mountains and the fading sun in one of America's most iconic stadiums. I won't ever forget the experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Scout1960
50,Invitation to the dugout club.,The elite area of Dodger stadium. The best way to take me out to the ball game.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/twebbmd
40,America's favorite pastime in one of its oldest cathedrals,On June 1st 2012 Johan Santana pitched the first no hitter in New York Mets history. Now 29 days later he would be starting in the third oldest major league ball park in the U.S. (the only older 2 are Fenway park in Boston and Wrigley field in Chicago). The Mets would prevail on this night with several of the Dodgers best players currently on the hurt list. Dodger Stadium has had many memories thru the years. Luckily the last few years of down turn are starting to be washed away by the a new ownership group. Someday soon they will need to have a new facility for the boys in blue but a baseball game is still a great family outing and they are lots of deals out there and there alot of activities that go on thru the game. Take your kids and give them memories that they will always remember. Seven of us went and we had one youngster in tow. Everyone had a great time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jedimasterkush
20,Re-Think,"We have been going to games at Dodger Stadium for the last 25 years. We take in one or two games depending on who is in town. There are a number of large parking lots that surround the stadium so there is no real issue with parking. The issue becomes leaving. The traffic flow patterns are troublesome and the signage to get back to the right freeway is confusing. If you park on the wrong side of the stadium it is a long difficult walk to get around. You need to go up and down a series of steps.The Stadium is showing its age and in need of maintenance. The rest rooms are in need of a deep cleaning. On our most recent visit, each staff member with whom we came in contact was rude and appeared not care about anything. Some questionable people were in violation of the rules posted right in front of them and the staff just walked away, ruining the experience for everyone else. The Stadium no longer maintains a family friendly atmosphere.We have never had a bad view no matter where our seats were located. The stadium’s open design makes viewing the game easy. There are no large poles or odd walls to block your view. The upper deck seating angles are steep and not suitable if you have walking issues.Food and drink prices were a bit higher than other venues in the area. The Dodger Dogs are still an enjoyable meal.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ryanwest

50,Take the Tour of Dodger Stadium,"On a recent trip to LA, took a tour of historic Dodger Stadium. (The stadium turned 50 in 2012) The tour costs $15 and takes about 90 minutes. On the tour, you get to go into the press boxes, the luxury suites and the dugout. The stadium tour allows you to appreciate the true history of the Dodgers both in Brookly and since their move to LA. If you are into the history of the game of baseball, I think its a must to do while in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travel200855

30,Dodgers are in 1st - The Stadium Must be Torn Down and Re-Built,This is an Historic Stadium that with new owners and a winning team needs to be torn down and rebuilt like the new football stadium we need in downtown! Let's do it now and include new subways into and out of the stadiums to reduce traffic and make LA a real No. 1 City!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lblivas148
50,Stadium Tour is awesome!,"I came here last Thursday for a Stadium Tour with my family (2adults, 2 children ages 7 & 11). It was an awesome experience and I would recommend it for any baseball fan, not just Dodger fans. You can find more info on the Dodgers mlb website. The tour is $15/adult and $10/child. The tour guide was great. He is very knowledgeable.The tour started at ""Top of the Park"" where you have excellent views of downtown. Unfortunately, we were there in the morning so the ""June gloom"" in LA didn't allow for the best views. But you could still make-out the skyline.He gave some history of the stadium, then took us to the Vin Scully press box, then to the club suites, the VIP restaurant and lounge, then we were able to go down into the dugout and step onto the ""field"" (yes, but not really.. We couldn't walk on the grass, we could touch it but not walk on it). Overall, it was a great experience! We didn't visit on a game day so we didn't see any players up close. I understand that you have a greater chance of seeing players if you go on a game day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/msksaenz

30,Go for the historical feel,"I wouldn't say we were exactly disappointed, because I loved being there, but aesthetically it was kind of bland to look at. I almost would say boring looking. And the fans hardly watch the game from what I could see. They were all too busy talking about non-baseball things, on their cell phones, or going to get extravagant desserts and other food items. I found myself wondering why they spent so much money to go to a baseball game they hardly watched. We had great seats a few rows from home plate, but the distance from those seats to home plate felt like forever because of the large foul territory at Dodger Stadium. I'll refrain from discussing the traffic getting in an out, because I'm sure everyone knows about that. On the positive side, the atmosphere was relaxing, the weather was fantastic, and the food options were as good as I've seen. As a long time baseball fan, I very much appreciated the historic feel of the park. I kept telling myself, ""I can't believe I'm at Dodger Stadium"". It was still a fun game and a fun place to watch a game. Not in my Top Ten though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/launcher69

There was a good mix of fans, no serious smack talk til the end (we lost that game). Security was thick! I felt safe. We had our 12 year old son w/us, maybe that was why.? $5 water, $13.50 Blue Moon, seemed more expensive than other stadiums... would go back, we had fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmandaWN2005

40,"Best stadium, and now McCourt is about gone","There is nothing quite like sitting at Dodger Stadium on a warm evening, watching the Boys in Blue. Good views from all over, but I prefer first base side (except for day games, go to the third base side). There are a variety of food choices. If you can get into the Stadium Club, you get an expensive buffet that is not worth it. Lines for food and bathrooms can be challenging at times, but having grown up with Ebbets Field and Yankee Stadium, and later the disaster of Shea Stadium, this reminds you of baseball as it was meant to be played. The luxury boxes are an afterthought (it was a regular level at one time), so they don;t detract from the experience. More advertising and more lights as the years go on. Bring a radio and listen to Vin Scully to follow what is going on (ecept when Vin talks about a fifty-year old game.) Generally, tickets can be had on Ebay for less than face.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SoCalTraveler91356
30,On my tour of ballparks,"While in LA, I decided I had to catch a game at Dodger Stadium. So much history there. Well, it looks fairly historical. The stadium is full of cracks and certainly nothing like the new ballparks around the country. I will say, it offers one of the cheapest seats in the major league. A park I would expect to find in Poughkeepsie, but not LA.Much like the ballpark in Arlington, fans get there late, but make up for it by leaving early. I guess a ballpark near the freeway will always get the fans in a hurry to get out of there.Anyway, enjoyed the game there. A reasonably pleasant experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BardL_12
50,The Dodger Game,"I sit in the Outfield, and love the atmosphere of this famous ball park, especially the way people in the stands talk to each other, joke around, and maybe a home run will come your way.I pay $24.00 for a ticket and just sit back & enjoy the game. Plus, you have your own food & restrooms, so everything is very close. There are all kinds of special nights with give aways or bargains. It is family oriented, but I often get the urge, go alone and have a great time too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CaliforniaNative54

This stadium is nostalgic and we just loved the experience of sitting up high overlooking the Hollywood Hills. Being that we were Mets fans and decked out accordingly, the Dodger fans and staff could not have been more hospitality to us rivals. The fireworks were equally fantastic! It was a great way to spend the 4th of July.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mlpcgo
50,Great Seats!,"We were given tickets to the Dugout Club. I had never been to Dodger Stadium before. The parking tickets we got were great - got to park right by the entrance.

50,Dodger Stadium Tour Awesome!,If you are a Dodger fan or a baseball stadium follower this tour isn't to be missed. My husband and I took both sides of our family on this terrific and very informative tour. Dodger fans since the later 60's we all loved every moment! Had an excellent tour guide named Lindsay who was very well versed on every aspect of the Dodgers. Our favorite partts were seeing where Vin Scully presides over the game and sitting in the owners box seats. Shopped the gift shop after. Great day!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suesuecalifornia
10,Dodger Stadium is a Dump!!!!,"New ownership group needs to invest HEAVILY into refurbing the stadium, now the third oldest in baseball after Wrigley and Fenway. And post Brian Stow, it is still a GHETTO, despite increased security (a joke), and two policemen that walk down the foul lines between innings. The foul language is the worst in baseball, and hardly a family atmosphere. The beers are too large, and drunks should not continue to be served!!!! These hoodlums ruin it for the few decent Dodger fans and guests from the visiting team. I was afraid to wear my Giants' colors. Standing in line is the worst, with vulgar and aggressive language at every corner!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/golfkat
50,Wonderful for baseball fans!!,"We were lucky and got seats under the covered area by first base.

Lots of fun for the whole family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ES782
30,Better than expected and great for the family !,We had a great time as a family. The worse thing about Dodgers stadium is that getting there is a NIGHTMARE !!!! Traffic going into the stadium is really bad and we left really early.The staff is very fan friendly and the kids got to run around the bases after the game. They need to have more food choices and the prices are very high (typical for every stadium),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lb33wonka
30,A Little Disappointing...,"I'm from Minnesota where we just got our new outdoor stadium a couple years ago, so my expectations may be a little high. I found the stadium to be very dated and just old. The seats were a very faded yellow and sticky and depending on the seats you couldn't see the main scoreboard. We went to a game when the Braves were in town and the stadium was practically empty, which was surprising to me since the Dodgers are doing so well this season. I love baseball though, so I still had a blast, just felt like I was in Spring Training facility, not a MLB ballpark.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NLJ3399

Exampledodger dog w Mac& cheese With Fritos.dog w Chili,cheese,Fritos.etc (Awesome)Yes folks all were so so yummy.Take the family and support the dodgers and have a great day at this old school historic park.I personally love this place.Cons: parking is $15 & beers are $13+ large.should lower the parking to $12 and beer prices to $10 and it would be a little nicer on the wallet.Have fun,u can even take the metro to union station and take the free shuttle to the stadium.

That was disappointing. If you enjoy baseball, definitely check out a Dodger game.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DrJenski
30,Dodger stadium needs retrofitting. Brutal fan interaction.,"While visiting the LA area, we were pleased to find the Dodgers were playing our favorite team, the Atlanta Braves. Great views of the cityfrom the parking lot were awesome. Dodger dogs were good. Our biggest issue was the lack of fan interaction. We sat in section 42, which was good because we were sheltered from rain, yet hard to see over the people n front of usand hard to read scoreboards, tocheck thecount on a batter. No video monitors anywhere other than in the outfield. if you went to t.he restroom, radio feed only... i would say go if you have never been, yet definately time for a retro fit with the new owners...we will not go back until they spend some $on upgrades. .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlecM55

40,Dodger History,"Enjoyed the Dodger History at the stadium. But for the money the new owners paid for the team a new stadium is a must.

40,Best record in National League-stadium too! 2012,"Th Apr12 our privilege to watch Pirates get their timbers shivered by our LA Dodgers. Food: a kind gentleman in loge took time to hand make garlic fires with sufficient butter and spice to float us to Italy. He sauteed them in a pan, so much better to wait for a good product than have the soggy mess residing under a holding lamp. No one complained about the wait. the buns on the dogs on the other hand, dissolved into the amorphous mass made by squeezing a loaf of cheap white bread. Too moist. Venue: not overwhelming security, but you knew they were there. Boneheads, thugs and other miscreants not in evidence. car parking a breeze, even at 7:10 p game start.

It was so wonderful. A private room, changing table, great.Sure, I've had my issues with the staff - this week, I called three times to get information on where my will call tickets would be (there are a few will call booths) and I got a different answer each time. And parking used to be much more of a nightmare, but last year they made some changes that appear to have worked well.Despite the issue here and there, the stadium itself shines bright.

That was my first time in dodger stadium, and it was amazing. Great views, lots of food and merchandise venders and great service. You can easily get there by los angeles transit metro buses. In the summer it can get very hot, so pack some sun screen and hat, or buy your tickets in the higher up levels of the ball park, where it's shaded. Overall though, it's a great venue to visit if your'e in los angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vegasmania
40,Good Experience,"Stadium is in easy access with a free shuttle service from Union station. As a tourist from the UK this was really good not knowing my way around LA yet.We had great views in the stadium, but it was expensive for beer a pint costing around $10,the same for a dodgers dog and garlic fries. This didn't stop us from having a great experience and we loved every minute of it, and the garlic fries are good.We spoke to season ticket holders around us, who made us feel welcome and although the dodgers were beaten we would certainly reccomend going to a baseball game and if in LA go and see the dodgers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mrlasvegass
30,"Classic ballpark, atmosphere is So-So","Dodger Stadium has some good history to it, but don't expect an amazing gameday experience (as if you're at Wrigley, Busch, Target Field, Fenway, or Yankee). What I mean by that, is there isn't shops to eat around the stadium or it isn't downtown that you really can walk to the game. For me that draws a lot away from the stadium. The fans are rather fairweathered, it is LA, so expect that to effect the atmosphere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tho0505
40,Nice Trip to Ball Park - Cool Surroundings!,"We attended an August game while visiting the LA area in August 2011. The stadium is located in a Canyon and the ball park itself is built into the hills. Pretty cool! We went on a Saturday night and the ballpark was less than half full - pretty shocking considering it was a beautiful weekend night. We are from St. Louis and our games are AWLAYS sold out!None the less - the facility had a very cool set up, the people were super friendly, and the Picante Hot Dog (spicy) was delicious! We are not huge baseball fans - but we typically enjoy visiting ballparks around the country to take in the atmosphere - and we are glad we checked this one out. If you are in the area and a game is going on - I totally recommend at least getting a cheap seat and pay this famous stadium a visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JTF_1977

50,Baseball fan? Don't miss!,"Even if your not a Dodger fan, you should go to a game for the experience. Up in the hills overlokking LA and such a historical place. We meet a celebrity everytime! If you were or remember the Brooklyn Dodgers, then this is a must do for you!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nolaqueen
40,Had a great time!!!,"While visiting my daughter in California, I bought tickets to the Dodgers/Phillies game. I live on the east coast and have never been to any other stadium than Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia. Dodger Stadium's scoreboard is a lot smaller than ours, but I totally enjoyed the game. Fans were great and food was good. Had a Dodgerdog. If in the area, see a baseball game at Dodger Stadium...had a great time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Barbaram612
30,TIME CAPSULE,"i am reviewing this as a baseball fan not a Phillies fan---we started in San Fran and saw the phils and the giants--hot chocolate with whipped cream venders-chowder in a bread bowl? seasoned hot nuts? really NOW go opposite all fans drive up the same street and park in the same parking lot---phillies phans yelled to us in the parking lot that they got kicked out of the stadium already----the police were there ----absolutely no tailgating- we are not a tailgating bunch but there was a strong presence in the parking lot----i felt like i was transported to the set of ""That 70's Show"" or the Brady Bunch--it was like a time warp---many of the seats were empty---but it was bobble head night---so more fans than usual--It almost got comical with the views of Nancy Bea it organ player--at one time it screen flashed Nancy Bea ROCKS! it was cute and pathetic at the same time---did you want a dodger dog, garlic fries (heaven sent), peanuts or an ice cream those are your only choices---boring----a Dodgers fan in front of us was reading a book (we took a picture)---the peanut guy had been there 20 some years was wearing a very bad hair piece and throwing peanut all over--- he actually hit one guy in the head and the didn't even want the peanuts------too much---the section assistant for where we were sitting went up an down the sparcely populated aisle reminicing with regulars about this and that-----get the heck out of the way!!!!! i understand reliving the good old days but this park is unreal..... the Phillies won but we really didn't have a good time?!?!?!??!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/irishhadc
50,Beautiful stadium and fun experience,"Dodger Stadium is a lot of fun and great way to meet some real Angelenos. Get some cheap seats, a Dodger Dog and get ready for 9 innings of America's Pastime. The closer to the field you are, the better you'll see the action but by and large you get a great view of the game from anywhere inside the stadium. I like the pavilions because they're close to the field, affordable and at the center of ""the wave."" Root, root, root for the Dodgers!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CG2G
50,Wonderful Stadium lots of history,Dodger Stadium is very nice classic 1960's feel to it. From the stadium dimensions to the benches its like going back in time. The seats are reasonable priced for the outfield all you can eat seats. I defintely would go back again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Edrico85
50,It's a CLASSIC. Don't listen to the Haters. GO THERE !,"As an East Coaster who makes it to Fenway Park 5 to 15 times a year, I used to be bummed that after Fenway and Wrigley the next oldest Classic ballpark remaining was Dodger Stadium, which opened 50 years after Fenway. I didn't expect to be WOWED by Dodger Stadium. But I was. The seating sprawls comfortably, affording great views of the playing field, the bleachers have that crazy roof, and beautiful tall Palm Trees project against a beautiful sky and mountain range behind the outfield. The food assortment was pretty darn good; not enough to rave about, but I do recommend the Fish Taco's. You get two Tacos, each with a quick fried fish fillet inside and topped with veggie and sauce appropriate for a Taco. Dodger Dogs were quite good. The beer selection was also OK. Dodger Beer was less expensive than Fenway beer. There was a lot of love to be found at dodger Stadium. The gal who sold me the Fish Taco had been working there for 25 years, having started just two years after she came to the U.S.. The duty Cop I chatted with said he LOVES the shifts he gets at the Stadium, loves the Dodgers, and wants to tour all 30 MLB parks someday. There's a lot to love. It's a funky park with many idiosyncracies. It needs new seats and some more TLC. The memorabilia on the walls of Suite Level are eye popping. Don't listen to the haters. Get there. You won't regret it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/athomeatfenway
30,Old-fashioned and out of date,"As a baseball lover visiting all the mlb ballparks, this one just isn't that great. I appreciated its old-school feel, but everything about it is inefficient. Parking was a nightmare, from waiting in line forever just to get in to the Nascar-like race to get out afterwards. The food/drink lines were horrendous--i missed a full inning just trying to buy a beer and pretzel. Therecwere lots of families in attendance, but overall, I felt a little unsafe and underwhelmed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jannrasp
30,"Don't bother, even if you're a baseball junkie","All the hype and hoopla about being a dangerous and scary place is true. Walking in to the place, security makes you feel like you've done something wrong and some of the angry looking fans make you feel even more unease. The walkways are dinghy and dirty, food is bad and the frequent f-bombs are a plenty. You can tell this once was a great park and until they clean up the place and the patrons that ruin it for us, don't go. Hopefully new ownership will figure this out. Don't go it's such a disappointment.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/haka-larry
30,Good stadium,"We've been to nearly all the MLB stadiums and Dodger Stadium is middle of the road. It is an older stadium but lacks the panache of Fenway and Wrigley. There isn't a ""must see"" area of the park or anything that makes it particularly stand out, but it is a good place to watch a game. Sight lines were good from our seats and the fans were nice. Of course I wasn't wearing a SF jersey.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dand978
20,Know Where to Park or You Will Walk Flights of Stairs,"I was really not impressed with Dodger Stadium. It is in major need of upgrades. I have visited several different ballparks around the country and Dodger Stadium was the worst. The bathrooms were located so far away from the seats. We parked the car, and then discovered that we had to walk down about six flights of stairs to get to our seats. We knew we would have to walk back up those stairs after the ballgame. I guess they haven't heard of escalators yet. We were limited to the small amount of food in our seating area. I know that they are planning upgrades to Dodger Stadium, and they are greatly needed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pilotgirl21
50,Great for all baseball fans,"Okay, maybe i'm a little biased because I happen to be a Dodger fan, but this is one of the few stadiums left in America that still have that old baseball feel to it. The food and facilities really aren't that great, but that's some of the magic behind the stadium. I've been to many arenas and stadiums throughout the country and most places have lost that good old fashioned feel. I would recommend getting nicer seats if you are a fan of the opposing team, as some of the patrons are not forgiving to the other team. Overall it's a great experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HexterGastoscar

50,The best ballpark in the country!,"Even if you are not a Dodgers fan, going to Dodger Stadium is must see. We think it is the best ballpark to see a ballgame. We have been there several times, but the first time was special. We had parked was was behind Home plate and when we walked into the stadium and down a runway to the seats, we looked down on a huge park with palm trees and mountains in the distance, a magnificent sight.Because of traffic, getting to the stadium is a challenge. We always try to get there early to beat the traffic and get a chance to see batting practice and walk around the stadium.From the parking lot behind home plate, you get wonderful views of downtown LA and the skyline.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ct-cruisers

The Dodgers lost, but the game and the energy was awesome!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/love2vacationCanada
20,Taxiless Dodger Stadium,Getting to the stadium is easy getting back to your hotel is not an easy task. There is a taxi stand in the front of the stadium but no taxis. We stood in a line for over an hour and not one taxi!! With over a hundred people stranded at the taxi stand a bus driver gave us a ride to a transit station. So I warn anyone that they had better have some other plan to get get back to your hotel other than a taxi at Dodger Stadium. Hey!! Management you should solve this persistent problem.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/whynot4382
10,Don't go!!,"I went recently and was accused of using profanity in the field level before the 7th inning. Security pulled me from my seats, accusing me of profanity which wasn't true. They questioned the people around me and they reported NO profanity. It was clear, Dodger security singled me out for an unsubstantiated use of profanity. I think they took the word of a Cardinal fan. Go to an Angel game, more fan friendly.Long time Dodger fan,Nathan",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/N8icus

10,"Dodger stadium, ghetto ball park","I’ve been to numerous MLB ball park across the USA but the Dodgers stadium is by far the bottom of the barrel. We got tickets to the left field bleaches front row, big mistake at this ballpark. I was frisked from head to toe like I was on the “no fly list” and my backpack rifled like no airport security I’ve seen, even Tel Aviv. For a security search they even made my wife lift her shirt up and she was wearing shorts. A total bunch of perverts for security. When we got the left field bleacher seats we were greeted by no less 22 security staff with ear pieces and dark glasses flanking all 4 sides of the bleaches. It kind of looks like they’re guarding a bunch of inmates. I spent 25 minutes in line for a beer when kegs blew dry causing a near riot in the second inning, yes second inning. I returned in the fourth inning to find shorter lines only to find out they ran out of larger cup. I talked to the guy next to me and in 2004 a Giants fan was stabbed to death in the parking lot 21 time. This is a ballpark that I finally check off my MLB list to visit but I will never be back. Only 6 more MLB ballparks to go and I always sit in the bleaches. Dodger’s stadium is defiantly at the bottom of the list for MLB stadiums.John M.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hookum
50,"Wow, what a great time","Dodger Stadium is the coolest place. I drove from northern Utah to LA to show my little league baseball playing son real baseball and this came through with flying ""blue"" colors. The setting in the hills without another place in site is awesome. This Chavez Ravine location is so cool. Its in the center of a huge city but feels like a little piece of county. The game was great. Our trip consisted of the beach and the game. It was the funnest trip to So Cal I have ever done. Only in Dodgertown can you get a Dodger Dog, and I must say it is the best hot dog in the world, (if any hot dog can be best) because its a Dodger Dog at Dodger Stadium. Hello, does it get any better? I say NO!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PJUtah
50,Lots of History,"Caught a Dodger game here on our west coast swing (went to the Dodgers, Angels, Giants and A’s stadiums). We got into LA at around 3pm and went straight to Olvera St. which is where LA originated and is across the street from Union Station, had a nice Mexican dinner and went to the Dodger game which is only a 5 min drive.Dodger stadium has a lot of history which you can see along the concourse walls (took a picture beside Kirk Gibson, that 1988 home run made me a fan for life). This stadium has a great atmosphere, despite the Dodgers losing we truly enjoyed the game, from the Dodger dogs to seeing the “Think Blue” sign in the outfield plus the bonus of a Firework Friday (the fireworks were amazing), this is one stadium you must visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dannunz
40,Ready... set... get silly!,"Maybe Dodger Stadium needs to come with a little book explaining its quirks. Here are a few basics for the novice.-Wear Dodger blue. Besides the omnipresent team shirts and ball caps, feel free to indulge your eccentricities. Wear blue and white wigs; Manny Ramirez dreadlock hats; deely boopers. Be zany; we're used to it.-Don't tell us how bad Dodger Dogs really are; we don't want to hear that. Outside the stadium, Dodger dogs may be bland and tasteless-- but mixed with the roar of a crowd; eaten to the tune of an organ; slathered with fixings which ooze from the wrapper and down your arm and they become magical.-Don't buy peanuts from a concession stand. BORING. You must wave at the peanut vendors strolling the stands, especially if they're in the frame of mind to yell ""PEA-nuts-- get your PEAnuts!"" just like they do in movies. Pass your money down the row and the vendor will toss you a bag of peanuts. These guys have serious pitching arms: some of them should be out there on the field in uniform.-When the Dodgers score, cheer wildly. Stomp your feet. Be as childish as you wish. It's all in good fun here. If The Other Team scores, boo loudly. We know it's immature; but it's also cathartic. We really don't hate them; we just don't want THEM to know that.-Around the fourth inning, look out for beach balls as impromptu volleyball games break out like gooseflesh in the stands. If you're anyplace other than field level, do NOT whack the beach ball into a lower level-- you will be booed. Should said beach ball be intercepted by a stadium employee, be sure to boo as noisily as possible. Once the employee turns his back, another beach ball will likely materialize and the game in the stands will resume.-Participate in The Wave. Even the vendors do. Non participation for any reason other than Our Team scoring a run is deemed automatic grounds for booing.-Wave wildly and dance when the cameras are roving the stands. Claim your 15 seconds of fame.-Learn the standards: Practice them loudly. Stomp. Yell. Clap. Cut loose. It's what we do.On the serious side, it should be noted that in an attempt to organize the post-game mass exodus, a highly regimented parking procedure has been implemented. Depending upon which gate you use, you will be ushered in a specific direction to a specific lot. Parking is now a whopping $15.00 for general admission. Preferred parking is for season ticket holders only, darn them. There are also now crossing guards to take some of the Evel Knieval aspect out of sprinting across driving lanes between the parking lots and the stadium. Within the stadium you'll find concession stands galore are inside offering an array of unhealthful treats. Depending upon where you sit, you may find sandwiches, sausages, some Mexican snack foods, Panda Express, Carls Jr., Subway Express and pizza. I guess I'm old-fashioned: anything beyond hot dogs, peanuts and Crackerjack just seems sacrilegious to me.Don't people realize what a fantastic thing a Dodger game is? There may be crime on the streets and horrible things going on in the world community-- but inside Dodger stadium, the barriers go down, everything outside is forgotten and men (and women) are created equal-- unless, perhaps, you happen to be cheering for the Other Side, in which event you may be fair game for hecklers, some of which may have been partying just a wee bit too much. Dodger Fans tend to take their roles as team supporters quite seriously, it seems-- which is just about the only thing serious going on inside the stands.Within the stands a judge may sit next to The Accused. Sharks sit next to the Jets, Capulets next to Montagues, Hatfields next to McCoys-- but here we'll all cheering for the same team, hoping for our chance to whack that beach ball or catch a fly ball fouled into the stands. Big city life has us all wound so tightly-- but inside Dodger Stadium is your chance to undo the damage and just have fun. Where else can you pass your money to a total stranger without batting an eye and know that your coke, Crackerjack or malt will be passed back to you in exchange?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gailg306
50,Don't miss out on this classic gem,"Not an antique like Wrigley or Fenway nor part of the new guard like Camden Yards and AT&T Park, this park stands alone as a classic example of the late fifties/early sixties stadium architecture with the expected SoCal flourishes. With all the running around and theme park activities that encompass your day, this quiet refuge brings a restful yet exciting end to a day. Tickets are reasonable and plentiful. The food decent and the team quite talented. Enjoy Chavez Ravine and its unique atmosphere. It is a true LA experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chuck539
50,Great tour across Dodger stadium,We went to LA when Dodgers were out of town on April 26 but we did the Dodger Stadium tour and it was Great!!! It last about an hour and half and Brett (the tour guide) is a really nice person with full knowledge of Dodgers history. The tour was $15 per adult and $10 for a senior. It's so worthy. A night before we went to Anaheim to watch the Angels.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MEXTRIPS
40,"Great classic, different ballpark, represents L.A.",Dodger Stadium was a pleasure to visit. The pastel color schemes and the views of mountains gives it a great Los Angeles feel. The Chavez Ravine location is interesting. They play good Southern Californian music at the games. The only thing that was disappointing was that I had top deck seats and was not allowed to roam anywhere else in the stadium. That was pretty unfortunate.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ClevelandBeachBoy
10,This place is GHETTO!!,"I am a woman who made the mistake of wearing an opposing team's hat to the game. You have trashy people who scream into your face about 2 inches from it. I've been to many MLB games around the country and the Dodgers fans are probably the worst around. I'm all for cheering on your team, but when they accost you because you are wearing an opposing team's hat...that is just unacceptable! The people can go back to the cages (or countries) they came from.I was exiting the stadium quietly and a man screamed into my face. I said sternly, ""Do Not Yell in My Face""...I was then PUNCHED in the back of the head.These people are trash and stay away unless you wish to get stabbed, shot, punched, etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LD_CA
40,"Park is Old-Style Classic, but Tours are Excellent","Park: Though this is soon to be the third-oldest baseball park in the Major Leagues (after Yankee Stadium closes this October), we found this park to be in relatively good condition. We took advantage of the rule allowing you to bring your own food and bottled water into the stadium, which seemed to be a good deal as a bottle of water alone is $4, so our exposure to the food at Dodger Stadium was limited. One member of our party tried a 'Dodger Dog' -- nothing special, but might be fun to try just because it's a Dodger classic. There have been several significant renovations to update the park since its opening in the 60s, and while aspects of the park such as the scoreboards and seating are adequate, Dodger Stadium doesn't measure up to modern Angel Stadium in Anaheim or PETCO Park in San Diego in those categories. It maintains its 60s feel -- our party agreed that we felt a bit as though we were in an episodes of 'The Jetsons'. However, the suites and restaurants, which we saw during the tour, are newly renovated and beautiful. Unlike any other park we've been to, Dodger Stadium is built in a ravine, which is interesting. For a park of its size, it seemed very clean. Lastly, as out-of-towners, we had heard about the crazy L.A. traffic but perhaps weren't quite prepared for the slow rides before and after the game -- keep in mind that the traffic is not to be underestimated and to try to leave extra travel time to and from the park.Tour: Our tour was one of the finest of the 15-or-so MLB ballpark tours that we have taken over the past several years. Our guide, Brett, did a fantastic job of blending information about Dodger Stadium itself with history of the Dodger franchise, the current team, and baseball statistics in general. This was the only tour we've taken during which we were shown a movie, and the 15-minute film that we watched gave a great overview of the Dodgers in Brooklyn, their move to L.A., and their several championship teams, among other things. The tour covered the areas commonly included on ballpark tours (dugout, field, press boxes, special dining areas, and luxury suites) except that we did not go into either clubhouse or either bullpen. While our guide Brett quipped that he'd seen the film 169 times, he lead the tour in a completely fresh and enthusiastic way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sfka2427
50,Fantastic Atmosphere,"We are from the UK and whenever we visit the US we try to fit in a trip or two to a baseball game. When we arranged to visit California we were pleased to see that the Dodgers would be at home when we were there, not only that but would be playing the Giants! We decided to stay in Pasadena, as we were in fact travelling down the Pacific Highway and acroos to Palm Springs. Pasadena turned out to be a perfect stop over. The game was a night game, and at this time of year it was perfect as we could arrive during daylight for a look around the stadium, and then nightime fell as we were there-perfect! Parking was easy, just of I110, we thought $15.00 was a bit steep for parking but there you go. The atmosphere outside the stadium was fantastic, and you could hear the announcer as soon as you got out of the car, believe me this is a novelty coming from England!We have been lucky enough to visit several stadiums, and have enjoyed them all. On a personal note the atmosphere and sense of history at Wrigley Field in Chicago takes some beating, but Dodger Stadium certainly came very close.We had a fantastic time there, and a nice easy drive back to our hotel in Pasadena.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Andy123Northampton
40,Classic Park,"This place is worth a visit. The atmosphere is very different. Sitting in the bleachers, its true, most people arent even paying attention to the game. Watching folks hit the beach ball around as the security people chase it down is amusing. And the crowd is about 75% latino which is pretty cool too. All in all, i had a good time here, but i was disappointed by one thing. If you get a ticket in the outfield bleachers, you have no access to the main grandstand. Therefore, when i go back i will get a ticket there so i can walk through the rest of the stadium. I heard the top level is also seperated off.G Man",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GMan5431
