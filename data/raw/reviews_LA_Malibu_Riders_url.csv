50,Saddle Up & Enjoy!,"We had originally scheduled this ride one week prior to the fire that devastated Paramount Ranch. But we rescheduled for April and perfect time of year. All the wildflowers were in bloom and the horses of course loved all the tall grass while riding. They recommend you arrive 45 minutes prior and this is correct as is takes time for give instructions and get everyone on their horse. They take 8 per ride and the youngest on our ride was 7 yrs old give or take and she did great for a first timer. The horses all follow each other as we go all over the hills for a total of 3.5 miles. You cross small creeks, where one horse doesn't like to get his feet wet! The guide was great as she explained the terrain and background of Paramount Ranch. We did the 11 am ride which is perfect as it can get hot in the summer. There is plenty of parking as well as restrooms. I highly recommend booking with them. Fun way to spend a morning or afternoon.",Lynette51
10,They might cancel without telling you!!!,"CALL BEFORE YOU GO TO MAKE SURE YOUR RESERVATION WAS NOT CANCELED. My family and I went out to California for Vacation. Took us 3 hours in traffic to get there to find out they canceled due to rain previous day's. The issue is I already drove the 3 hours. They offered free rides but when you are from out of town might be better to offer to mail rain checks that don't expire and other offered items. Waisted 5 hours round trip, a tank of gas, and a crying daughter for NOTHING! Horrible company with horrible communication.",dillebr
50,Best Horseback Riding in Los Angeles,We had a fabulous time riding in the hills of Malibu! The trail was beautiful and our guide was friendly. Our nine year old daughter was comfortable and easily controlled her horse. We have been riding many times and this was by far one of our best experiences.,Joanna T
50,These ladies are the BEST!,"The ladies who did our ride were so kind, friendly and funny. They matched us up with the right horse and gave us very helpful tips to make the most of our ride.Beautiful scenery and definitely a highlight of our trip! A must if youâ€™re in the area",Pip09
50,Fun ride with Ashley,"Did the early morning hour ride Zuma Trail. Very much enjoyed the ride with our guide Ashley, she was very friendly and knowledgeable. We are huge animal lovers and we were very happy to see how well cared for the horses were! Fun time! ( nice ride with horses Bailey & Sulton)",Steve B
50,Morning Ride,"on Tuesday morning we (my daughter and i) took a Back horse ride with Malibu Riders on Paramount Ranch in was getting hotter by seconds. prediction it should be over 100 that day. Instructor took us little bit early than original time stated but it was beneficial to us and horses. After brief welcomes and instruction on horses we would ride, all of us were on horses and we riding it off. We pass old setup for western movie set and get to mountains to see a panoramic view of ranch and hills around us. Lady instructor show us couple different type of riding a horse and they were trained well. Trey did their work and follow a master with those rides. because i don't think so i can make a horse ride different then walking. Tons of fun",Alex_suomi
50,Great Ride!,Took an hour ride this morning. Recommend the early ride 9:00 because it was getting warm! Lindsay was our guide and was very friendly and shared a lot of facts and information about the park and the horses. Really enjoyed the morning and would recommend!,youga4you
50,Awesome Ride!,We took a one-hour ride in Zuma Canyon. The horses were wonderful and well taken care of. Our guide was great and very knowledgeable and helpful. Would definitely recommend!,Amy H
50,Great ride!,Lindsey was a great guide. Horses are well cared for and perfect for beginner or someone with slight experience. Beautiful scenery and nice stop in the creek on Paramount Ranch ride.,AlexisCody
50,Wonderful!,"My wife and I did a one hour ride at Paramount Ranch. It was pretty hot that afternoon, but we were lucky enough to be the only people on the tour. This was great because it allowed for greater interaction with the guide. The scenery at Paramount Ranch is beautiful and the ride through the Santa Monica Mountains was very relaxing. The trail ends at a creek which gives the horses time to cool off and get a drink. Definitely my favorite part of the trip. Highly recommended and look forward to trying the Zuma Canyon trail when I'm back in town.",Ed Q
50,Horseback riding,"Excellent horseback riding experience experience with my twelve year old son, both of us novices. Our guide, Scott, was great, super-helpful, knowledgeable and informative. The Paramount Ranch is rich in Movie history and has breathtaking views. The horses are calm. The mountain trails and the (optional) river crossings are fun. We had a great time.",gregreviewreview
50,Great riding through the hills,"I forgot to review this earlier so apologies it's a little out of sync. We were staying in Malibu and decided to go riding whilst we were up in the hills. I saw this company and they were brilliant, being incredibly friendly! We booked a ride through the Paramount ranch and although we didn't book a private ride, unsurprisingly there wasn't too many people in January! The guides were lovely and we were 5 of us in total. It was a great ride, I got to try riding Western style for the first time and the horses are really well looked after. Would definitely recommend.",Bexiboo09
40,"Nice ride, great location","Very good ride, just the right amount of time, 1 hour. Trails is a little rough right now due to all the rains so ground has ruts and overgrowth on the trail. Horses are good though Historian, female, is strong willed and big. Needs a firm rider to control. Nice outfit running the ride though.",kcslatts
50,1 hour trail ride through Paramount Ranch,"Beautiful and inexpensive hour long ride through the hills of CA, including an old west movie town where we saw an actual filming. Ashley was our guide and she was AWESOME! Kept my 8 yr. old daughter comfortable and happy. Great views of the hills and even goes through a little creek at the end.",Jay V
50,Really Fun Trail Ride and Breathtaking Scenery,"My daughters are I enjoyed the Paramount Ranch trail ride. Ashley was a great guide. So friendly and sweet and capable. Riding through Western Town was so cool and they were setting up to film which was interesting. The scenery was spectacular, the horses well trained and manageable. Riding through the creek was a highlight. And we so appreciated Ashley setting up a photo shoot for us. A big highlight for my equestrian daughter and for me as well. Very fun adventure. The drive to the ranch from Malibu is also quite exciting.",VickyF394
50,Great ride!,"We took a beautiful afternoon ride and couldn't have been happier. Our guide was Scott, aka Scooter, and he is the best guide we have ever had. He had a great personality, was knowledgeable, and you could tell he loved his job. Most importantly, he truly loved and cared about the horses. The price was fair and the scenery beautiful, we even spotted a couple of coyotes.",katNashville_Tn
50,Horse Riding in the Hills was an unforgettable and enjoyable experience!,"My family of 5 consisting of myself, my younger sister of 9, younger brother of 11 and my two parents ventured out to the Ranch to ride for at least 2 miles by horseback around the narrow but picturesque paths that led you around the steep hills and the former racetrack as well as throughout the filming sets that are well upkept. Our tour guide, a former actor, took us around in a relaxed but confident way that enabled us all to be comfortable with our individidual horses and riding them through the route that we took. It was great to be able to engage and talk with our tour guide and to learn more about the area in which we were riding. Furthermore, the weather was great and we all developed a personal rapport with our horses, before getting a great set of photos taken to commemorate the occasion. If you are situated around Ventura and Los Angeles County this definitely makes a perfect day out for the family as well as for international tourists such as us who were resident nearby.",Lewis W
50,Very enjoyable,"While visiting our son in Los Angeles, we decided to contact Malibu Riders to take a two hour horseback ride through Malibu State Park. It was fantastic. Lindsay was our guide, and she did a great job. She was fun and knowledgeable about the area. It was the most relaxing day we had in L.A. The views were amazing during the entire ride and became breathtaking once we reached the top of the mountain. I highly recommend Malibu Riders.",Michele From Pittsburgh
50,Wonderful morning spent horseback riding on the Paramount Ranch.,"It was 930 am on gorgeous California morning.My 10 year old daughter and I were waiting at the Paramount Ranch to go horseback riding, her first time. We were greeted by two horse trailers. The guides were unloading the horses and immediately gave them food to eat while we all got signed in and debriefed. We chose the ride through the old movie sets were shows like little house on the prairie and gun smoke were filmed. The ride lasted a little over an hour and our guide Scott AKA Scooter could not have been a better guide. He spent time speaking to each guest on the ride asking what they did for a living and why they chose the work. He spent time explaining all of the history of the Ranch and all of the different movies filmed there. He made my daughter feel extra special teaching her a few tricks of riding horses ect. I have been horseback ridding many times all over the country and I can say this was one of the best times I have ever had. My daughter loved its so much she want to go back next weekend, Thank you Malibu Riders for and wonderful memory made with my daughter and your guide Scooter! We will definitely return!",christianofer
50,Best trail ride,"We went to the Paramount trail. Our guide, Scott, was wonderful with everyone from beginners to advanced riders. The trail started at the Paramount western movie set, wandered into the foothills and crossed a stream. We ride a lot and this was among the best trail rides we've taken.",TotallyMadeUpHandle
50,If you are looking for a good experience,This ranch will meet any needs within reason and take you on a fantastic journey through the canyons or creek. Scooter is the best tour guide I've seen on the east coast. All the horses are healthy and in great spirits. I've been several times this past year. I'm very fond of the herd and the trails.,Bourre255
50,the perfect ride!!!,"as a first time rider, we had John as our guide, the only word is awesome! the views were beautiful, he even took us up to take a picture, and guided us around the paramount sets there.would recommend to take this tour",zussman s
50,Horse Riding at Paramount Ranch,"We are complete novices at horseriding and had a wonderful time. John was excellent in helping us and clearly loved the the horses and took excellent care of them. The horses are gorgeous, steady but full of character. I can't think of anywhere I'd rather ride than through a very authentic looking western town and into the surrounding hills. It was probably the best experience of a fabulous holiday. We will be back next year and can't wait to do this again.",Jan186298
50,Great Trail Ride,"My 12-year-old daughter and I both ride hunter/jumper. However, she has never been on a ""real"" trail ride. I booked the Paramount Ranch ride less than 24 hours in advance. The booking and transaction were quick and easy with a confirmation text with directions sent immediately. We were staying in downtown LA and had no idea how long it would take to get there. It was an easy drive-less than an hour. Sarah and Daniel welcomed us immediately and got right to business. We brought our own helmets and filled out the paper work prior to arriving (it is available on their website...and saved a bit of time when we go there). They quickly made sure everyone's paperwork was in order and fitted everyone with helmets. Everything ran smoothly. The horses know their jobs and are good at them. Each one had a story and some are even a bit famous! The ride takes you through the old western town where Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman was filmed, among others (parts of American Sniper were recently filmed here). The trail is absolutely beautiful and Sarah did a great job of leading the train and providing direction as well as interesting stories about the property, the horses and asking about each rider. It was a great experience. Going through the creek at the end was a real highlight. My daughter wants to come back and do the 2 hour loop trail across the street. I think that we will try to book a private ride next time, as we would like to do some trotting and cantering. This was a wonderful way to spend some time together, see some beautiful scenery and spend some time with horses. I highly recommend Malibu Riders!",katnvivi
50,Great ride!,We arranged for a custom ride and got one! It was more than anticipated. I had preconceived idea being in Malibu region. It exceeded my expectationsm. I ride weekly and have done international tides.,96Juanita
50,Great riding experience,"I've been horseback riding (English and a little Western) for over 15 years. I've taken countless friends trail riding. I was visiting LA with a friend who'd never been on a horse before and this is one of the best trail experiences I've had. The horses are very well cared for. They're well trained, well groomed, well fed and not over worked. At most trail rides, there's one or two horses who won't stop eating or keep crowding the other horses. We had none of those difficulties in our group of 6. The trail guide was friendly and provided nice information about the areas we rode through. They're prices are reasonable, the area we rode in was interesting and beautiful and I'd recommend them anyone in the area.",Ali C
50,My children haven't stopped thanking me for booking this !,I booked a horse ride for my family through Malibu Riders - who rang me straight back and organized a ride that was suitable for our experience (or lack of !) and convenient. We arrived at Paramount Ranch and were greeted by Lane who matched our experience to the perfect horse for each of us. My son is 9 and never ridden my daughter 13 hasn't ridden for a few years as haven't my husband and I. Lane took my son at the front and was constantly guiding him and encouraging him the whole time - by the time we had finished my son wanted to buy a horse !!!! My husbands horse was a star in her own right Ney Ney had been ridden by Jennifer Lawrence in a Rolling Stones interview as all as a cameo in Blood Brothers and Bachelor and Bachelorette ! A fantastic afternoon hacking through the Malibu Hills on wonderful horses. Lane was very informative when it came to the location. Thank you Laura and Lane for looking after us - we will be back in July and will be booking the Malibu Creek ride with you ! Oh and we were provided with riding hats too !,EBlatcher
50,Wonderful way to spend the day!,"I did the 2 hour Malibu Creek ride and the 1 hour Paramount Ranch ride. Both were great, and our guide, Scott, was amazing. I had ridden a horse before but did not have much experience, and Scott was a great teacher and took some photos for us which turned out beautifully. The horses were so sweet, I really enjoyed spending time with them. The scenery was beautiful, especially for the Malibu Creek ride. It was very fun as we also got to trot and canter for a short time on the rides. I also enjoyed going through the creek. I highly recommend these rides. I am definitely going to come back for another ride soon, it was a great experience and very relaxing.",Linnea
50,Amazing!,"Went for an hours ride last year with Jessica around the Zuma canyon. My mum, sister and I are all riders with mum and sister being less confident! We got super horses and Shahana was the spitting image of my mare at home in the UK. I work in the trekking industry at home and my only gripe is riding hats are a necessity and it was alarming to see our guide minus one! Price was a little high as the price was what we charge for a 2hr ride!",Duffiduff
50,Very accommodating!,We did not have any reservations and called the day before to see if they could take us to Paramont Ranch. They didn't have a trip planned there that weekend but made an exception because we were from Ohio. Our guide was very helpful and was extremely nice. Malibu Riders is worth giving a try!,PoliSciGuy24
50,Scenic,Hwy 1N is very scenic right on the ocean on Malibu. With houses on your left and Ocean on right. If you have time then drive down about 18 miles and hit Venice beach boardwalk. You will pass Santa Monica pier on same route.,C D
10,Horrible Place,"Horrible place. Disgraceful. Trainers know nothing about horses, while I am a professional trainer and rider, I seriously gave them a lesson out on the trail. They had never heard of a ""half halt."" Nor had they ever heard of a ""gag bit"" which they were using. They thought pulling back super hard made the horse stop. Ha. They also though yanking both reins to the right over the horse's head made it go right. All it does is make the horse's head go up, butt to sideways, and probably rear. DO NOT TRY AT HOME! It's amazing no one has been killed yet here.",Sandy Z
50,Best trail riding experience in LA area,"My soon to be husband and I went horseback riding on our first date....long ago...because he knew I love horses (but on a different level than trail riding, I used to compete and have owned four of my own hunter/jumper and dressage horses). When he asked if I wanted to go riding again recently I said yes mostly because I hadn't been on a horse in ages but figured it would be a similar cheesy trail ride on dirty nose to rump barn nags like the first date. BUT IT WAS MUCH BETTER! Malibu riders trailered beautiful, clean, well kept horses to paramount for us. The trails were gorgeous, they let us ride 'to our ability level' - no strict 'no trotting' rules, I was able to let the horse go and have some fun. My horse was responsive and really cute. Best part? At the end of the ride they took us up to a picnic area.....where waiting for us were flowers, champagne, lunch and music...and my proposal :) They did a great job.",marybhughes
40,Wonderful experience!,"I stayed in LA over the weekend after a business trip and went on a trail ride with Malibu Riders. It was a great experience and I am really glad I went. My horse was well behaved and healthy, which is really important to me since there are many trail riding places who do not take good care of their horses. The ride into the mountains was breathtaking, but a little scary, as the way down is very very steep. I have ridden horses for many years and I was still a little nervous, so if you're timid, be sure to speak up and ask for a easy trail. All in all, it was fantastic and one of the best experiences ever for me.",PGHtraveler2019
