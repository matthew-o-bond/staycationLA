50,Passport to History Site for Kids,"I have one of those Passport to History books for my son and about once a month or more we go collect his stamps and visit museums. This one was pretty cool, they have an area where kids can buy feed and feed the animals, they have a horse, bull and some sheep. Lots of chickens for the kids to feed. There are also several cats roaming around and let the kids pet them. I am not sure if this was just the day we were there but the parking lot had an attendant that charged some people to park maybe for them to visit elsewhere but he didn't charge us because we were going to the museum. There is a small museum gift shop, overall it was a very nice afternoon exploring around at all the displays and walking through the house.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Andre2411

40,Interesting history,"Has many interesting historical items not found anywhere else. Amazing to see and imagine the area on how it was before the big city swallowed it all up. A great place to see how life was and it's great to see it preserved for future generations. Cool to see the rural aspects of life in the area before sidewalks, streets, strip centers and luxury automobiles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Randy2353

50,Great Place to visit with Children!,"I'm always looking for interesting places to go with my toddler, and we have been frequenting the Leonis Adobe for years now. The staff is super friendly! Shout out to our favorite guide, Tomu (I hope I spelled that right)! My son loves water fountains, and there is one right before you even enter, which he loves. I should mention there is free parking.When you go in the first little house there is a gift shop and some museum items about the property. This is where you pay. It is by donation, but you can get a season pass for only $40! They are only open Friday's during the week (and weekends I think in addition to special events). I do wish they were open more. You can buy goat or chicken food for only a dollar.Outside there are many things to look at. The animals are of course a favorite! They have sheep, goats, various types of chickens, turkey's, roosters, two ver large horses and some very impressive texas long horns! There are also many things to look at on the property, including the actual Leonis Adobe Museum which you can walk through. This is where my toddler got tons of practice going up and down the strais! haha.My son loves the giant triangle that he can hit, the water pump that he can no do by himself and he loves walking up the giant stairs to what was some of the worker's quarters. While on one hand I could see folks coming here and think it's not a ton of stuff compared to other large museums... for a small museum there is actually a ton to explore! There are a bunch of little displays and rooms all around for the kids to explore. There's also just a nice big space when my toddler was more into running around and I was crazy bored of parks and playgrounds. There are also cats that walk around that he loves to look at.So if you're in LA with kids and haven't explored this yet... do yourself a favor and get over here next Friday!ps... They also have a large garden around the corner that we actually haven't even done yet! Get a coffee in the coffee shop in the back of The Peddler's Fork across the street!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bostonsavatage
50,"Interesting, historic museum in the heart of small-town Calabasas","This is a neat place. They have interesting docents, a small farm (kids can feed the animals), and it's a historic landmark in the middle of Calabasas. It's worth a stop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Deborah91302
40,Frontier Life in the San Fernando Valley,Excellent tour of the adobe that dominated thousands of acres as the largest ranch in the southwest valley in the 1800s. Youg et to feel the challenges of life on the frontier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sheldonm421
50,Fascinating Calabasas history,"Well worth an hour or so to tour round, see the old ranch house and learn about the occupants, see how they lived, their old equipment, both for household and farming. Also to learn about the settlers in the area, and how they came to be there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bdkLosAngeles
50,An enjoyable family experience.,"We took the grandchildren to a special event where they were letting kids experience, hands on. different historical activities. they loved it-from using an old treadle sewing machine to watching the blacksmith in action etc. Of course the animals are always a great draw.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1Donna511
50,Hidden Gem,"A Basque sheepherder flees prosecution for smuggling, comes to LA and winds up ""King of Calabasas"" - the 3rd richest man in CA. Sure, it sounds like a Hollywood story because it is. The man could barely speak English but that didn't stop him from filing nearly 30 court cases. This guy, Miguel Leonis isn't the nicest guy. But he's smart and leverages every advantage to become a land baron. Meanwhile he tells everyone his wife is just his housekeeper... It takes her years to regain the land he stole from her and she becomes the first woman - a Native American woman at that - to win what would be known as Alimony in California.Kids will love the chickens, turkeys, long horn cattle, sheep and other live stock at the site - and the docents are magnificent! Extremely knowledgeable. The grounds are amazing with a great display of farm implimants and wagons.We heard a great podcast about the Leonis Adobe called the Drift and Ramble Podcast. Driftandramble.comBe sure to check out all the other nearby sites, too! There's a lot of hidden history nearby.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Actual_User
50,Great fro reflecting on then and now.,We've come a long way. In some ways. Really enjoyed my visit here and the live animals are a great touch.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DerrickB20
40,Interesting slice of Los Angeles history,"Make sure that you take one of the docent tours. It's a short tour but worth the time, and especially ask about the ghosts. The history is quite colorful and the grounds are kept authentically.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Artsy12
50,Well preserved museum!!,"The Leonis Adobe is a nice place to stop for an hour or so when traveling in either direction on the 101 freeway. It is 1 minute from the freeway exit.They have several historic structures, the main Leonis adobe, the plumer's house - moved here from Hollywood. The water tower, barn and more.They have 2 percheron horses, 3 long horn (one bull and two cows) the two cows are mother daughter. Interesting to seeCows with 4 foot horns.They have sheep, chickens, turkeys an more. The store sells feed and you can feed the chicken and the sheet.This place really shows how life was in the early 1800.After 50+ historical homes, this is the first we see with dirt floors.They also are the creator of the historical passport. This is book we use to find all the historical homes in southern california.It is for sale at their store - $5. Totally worth it. The book shows home, features, schedules, fees for a lot of historical homes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lxjuarez
40,Well preserved piece of history,"This is a good location to visit a part of LA's history. Its own history is rather amusing as well and the historical site is fairly large comparatively speaking. Good for the family but Africa hot in the hot summer days. Bring a hat, it can be dusty if windy as most of its dirt walking paths as was typical for its day. Not a half-day place to visit but good for 1-2 hours of entertainment. And when done you've got old town Calabasas right across the street for eats and drinks.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/reyc632
50,Lots of history,The Leonis Museum is chocked full of history. The ladies that give you wonderful rid bits of info on the history and the family.

40,Hidden Museum alongside the 101 Freeway,You would never guess there is a museum that runs parallel along the freeway. This is a cute little museum right off the freeway. It gives the history of one settler who came to Los Angeles and was quite a businessman who acquired land and built the Leonis Adobe. When you first arrive you enter thru the gift shop in the Plummer House where a docent is there to greet you and give you some background and history of the family and the house that is standing today. The docents are in period dress to authenticate the time period. Then you can explore the Adobe grounds on your own. There is farm equipment to read about as well as numerous animals. You can walk thru the adobe and look in each room to see how life was back 1800's. Due to all the various live animals this is popular for families with small children. Parking is free and I recommend going early as it will get busy. It takes no more than an hour to walk around the grounds and read all the placards.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lynette51
50,Taking my grandchildren for the first time,"We went in the summer for a children's program. We got the tour of the outside, the working area, and the children learned how make a tortilla, and watched and helped to make a horseshoe. The excitement they had that day was talked about for days",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/judylG1006FI
50,Old West in Calabasas,"Something for everyone. The Leonis Adobe Museum and house give you a great learning experience on the old west.

There is free parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M6268FTalik
40,Step Back in Time,"Each year we take our kindergarten classes to see the Leonis Adobe. Each time it feels like we've stepped back in time. Although the city has grown up around it, the Adobe retains its historical beauty. The Adobe is surrounded by gardens and a small petting zoo. Docents are dressed in period costume.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bruinjeepman
50,Excellent,Like stepping back in history over 200 years. The staff are the best you get a tour and they are so knowledgeable. It is so interesting. I spent about an hour looking at the house grounds and animals. The gift shop is also very nice,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bridgetpianos
40,A gem of preserved California history,"This is a fun site, well worth a visit. Mr. Leonis was a colorful character: a French Basque adventurer who acquired the property from his common-law wife, the daughter of a Chumash Indian chieftain. Leonis parlayed that core property into a land empire making him one of the largest and most powerful landowners in early Los Angeles. The adobe is a large, handsome house, filled with 19thC furniture and some portrait photos. Outside are farm machines, well-explained by kind docents and printed signs. Even live animals, including giant Percheron horses, Merlin and Morgan!. The Visitor's Center is a second 19thC house, moved here from West Hollywood.Take care: this site is open only limited hours during the week. (At other times, it's reserved for school tours.)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RuNanS
40,short on time but enjoyed,"Thought the place was open until 5pm but showed up at 340p to find out it closed at 4pm. The docents let us in anyway, gave us a short presentation and then let us look around the grounds on our own. We were leaving early the next day otherwise we would've come back. Huge property with farm animals and lots of history.Will have to come back another time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Monica0902
50,My young sons' favored playground,"On Saturdays just across the street is a small, but interesting Farmer's Market. While we are shopping, the boys, now 13 and 11 play here a lot. Real nice historical place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hanyecz
50,Best kept secret for local history,Try to actually visit Leonis Adobe instead of just using it for parking next to the Sagebrush Cantina. The grounds are well maintained and you immediately feel back in the wild wild west! Staff is helpful and to think this treasure was almost demolished for commercial purposes.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/853DavidL
40,Old California History,"There are two parts to the site, the original adobe with various ranch buildings and the Plummer House. The two-story adobe is restored and furnished as it might have looked 175 years ago. There is a barn and several pens of animals, some can be fed. The tank house is interesting. The Plummer House was moved here in the late 20th century from West Hollywood where it was about to be torn down, the Plummer and the Leonis family were friends and it seemed a good place for the small Victorian style house.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KennethL828
40,A look back in time,"There are two interesting buildings to visit here - an historic adobe and a cottage (the oldest house in Hollywood) which was relocated from another site. The grounds - a former ranchette - include some livestock and gardens. The docents are quite knowledgeable. If you like history, this is worth the $4 adult admission fee. Kids would enjoy the longhorn steer, merino sheep, turkeys, chickens, etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gcarr
50,An interesting find in Calabasas,Learning about this museum and its origins was very interesting. The kids enjoyed feeding the animals. Its too bad that the big house cannot be air conditioned because of its construction. We didn't stay as long as we would have if it was cooler. Price is free and donations are encouraged. Definitely a worthwhile place to visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barbgoodkin
40,A bit of California History in downtown Calabasas,"Leonis Adboe Museum is easy and interesting stop for anyone visiting Calabasas. The museum consists of the Leonis Adobe Mansion, Plummer House, barns, open areas and livestock. The Plummer House was the oldest house in Hollywood prior to it's move to Calabasas. The house has been lovingly restored. Also on the grounds is the Leonis Adobe, the home built by Miguel Leonis and his wife Espiritu Chijulla in the late 1800's. You can tour the inside of the homes and get a peak of life in Calabasas from back in time.The museum has frequent special events for children.

40,A step back in CA history,"This site is great for someone wanting to understand the early roots of the greater Los Angeles area. Docents are dressed in period garments and are well informed about the history of the area. They also cater to children with many hands-on activities and an opportunity to feed the resident farm animals. California residents should also check out the ""Passport 2 History"" offered by the Leonis Adobe Association for $5. This is a guide to historical sites from San Diego to San Luis Obispo and is a unique resource for exploring historical parts of California, many of which are off the beaten path.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SherryP289
50,Old town Calabasas attraction,"School children visit Leonids adobe with their teachers as well as many who happen through Calabasas as it is an historical landmark.

50,Takes you back to an earlier time (but it is really not that long ago),"If you're in the western San Fernando Valley, don't miss out on visiting the Leonis Adobe Museum. It is in the Calabasas Historic District and near some great eateries (but also a little bit of a walk to the Calabasas Commons where there are more places to eat/shop). Kids find it interesting since there are farm animals but as a history buff, so did I. The gift shop has books and other items for sale at reasonable prices. There are sometimes special events on the weekend so check out their website and see what's going on to better plan your visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BZM_13
50,A quiet look back...,"Leonis Adobe is a small historical site run by some very sweet docents...I had arranged a very small group tour and they devoted about three hours to us first showing a film and then taking us on a tour of the adobe and the outbuildings, gardens, and animal pens. Kids were thrilled with whole thing and the parents felt as if they had stepped back to a slower, sweeter time...thank you to the people who give of their time to share the history and feel of the period!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CalaX2

It is now open for public docent-hosted tours, but you can visit the gardens and farm structures on your own. The wonderful farm animals, a really nice gift shop, and extremely helpful docents make this historical site a worthy visit for all ages interested in early California life. You are welcome to have a picnic and stroll through Calabasas Park... lush and shady, with a footbridge, ponds and waterfalls, flowers and a gazebo for resting awhile. There is so much historical information about the Leonis Adobe, you should probably check out their comprehensive website for hours, directions, and other visitor information. I spent a very enjoyable day there, and recommend it for everyone",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sandytravelbug
