50,The spirits are about to speak,"Well I know they took this down and when I lived in LA, (back in the 70s and early 80s) I'd pass it at Hayvenhurst & Sunset every day. It had a cute little shop and the statue of Bullwinkle and Rocky out front. It's long gone but it was special to this person who grew up watching Rock Bullwinkle show.",niceoldladyinside
50,Where are moose and squirrel?,Where are moose and squirrel? For eons they stood proudly on the Sunset Strip. Between the West Hollywood City Hall and rumors on the web I cannot find my favorite duo. Lots of tales and folklore. Transylvania or perhaps the CIA and Area 51. I cannot get a straight answer. Perhaps itâ€™s a plot for the way back machine to track back where they were last seen. Captain Crunch and Dudley Do Right need to be called to the rescue. Do I blame Boris and Natasha?Just tell us who and how to return them to the Sunset Strip.Still searching.,Cavydad
10,Not There,"Don't bother looking for the statue, I went there and had a look, it's only a dog grooming place now.",Ivan C
40,Looks great after restoration,"It's now on display at West Hollywood City Hall after a wonderful restoration financed by DreamWorks. The City is preparing a permanent display spot, but it will remain in City Hall until then. You can see it from the sidewalk, so City Hall does not have to be open. Pretty Cool!",JohnRyan724
50,Great Memories,"after watching the cartoons as a kid it was quite a buzz to see the rocky and Bullwinkle statue, was well worth the visit",Lorde D
50,Bullwinkle Statue Removed Today,"The famous Bullwinkle statue was removed today from it's location on Sunset Blvd and will now go to Dreamworks to be used as a promotion for the upcoming Peabody & Sherman movie due out in 2014.Ric Scozzari, the artist who restored the statue in 2004 and was there today at the removal says the famous statue may end up at the Television Academy building in Beverly Hills when Dreamworks is done with it.",Rob S
30,We spotted the statue on our Hollywood Tour,"We wanted to surprise my husbands aunt with a photo. It is OK, you can stand back and take some good shots. After decades we were surprised we would ever found a statue still standing in Hollywood. It's right on Sunset and easy to find, if you have some older family members who grew up with the Moose it worth the stop.",Karen B
20,Maybe once.,"Too bad so sad that nothing is happening with Rocky and Bullwinkle any longer - it is just a run down former item, now a doggie day care.",DoctorBuckles
30,Great for picks!,"Nice to see old studio, nice for pictures for memories.",Johnnycatt
30,Cute but not really accessible.,I made a point to check this out because my Dad was a fan when he was a kid and I remember watching it when I was little. The statue is behind a fence in front of a some kind of pet grooming store. You can see most of the statue but you can not see the base and you can't go right up to it.,BlueTiger28
