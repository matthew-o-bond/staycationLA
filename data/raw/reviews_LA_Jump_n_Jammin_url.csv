20,First time,"First thing, don’t go on a Sunday. Parking lot was way packed. We found a spot far from the venue. Then there was a long wait to get into this play place. For the kids it was cool and fun so it’s basically for them anyways. There is 3 weak vending machines full of nothing but high fructose corn syrup treats and drinks. No atm’s so bring single dollar bills if you want something from the vending machines. One lady was trying to get back in and it took forever for her to unlock the little gate lock so this lady climbed over to attend to her crying kid. So they need to get a better system for there locks. It’s a dangerous hazard. Little negatives easily fixable. Plenty of positives for the kids though.-Enjoi",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/221daniely
40,Birthday Party,"I took my daughter for a birthday, since it's located at the Santa Anita mall, parking was not the easiest to find. Parents remember your socks if you want to just observe your children, they cost $2. Just another typical jump place for kids to play. Fun for kids, wish they had a coffee bar for the parents.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mkim1775
40,Kids loved this,"Never been to a place like this for kids. Definitely not for kids under 3 ( toddlers), lots of fun for kids under 12. Lots of stuff for kids to climb on. Not for kids with ADA needs. Kind of pricey, but definitely a good rainy day place to take the kids to burn off some energy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GaryI428
50,Great place when its too hot to play outside,Our Grandson visited us here in Arcadia from Texas for 6 weeks. What a great place to take him to and burn off some energy. Just wished we would've thought of it before Week 4! Clean place and attentive staff. Good job!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RVK1960
40,Low-Key Fun But With High Energy Levels,"Jump 'n Jammin is a great place for kids and adults. Spacious, clean, and surprisingly subdued, it features small Nerf balls throughout, and has several air cannons on a tri-level apparatus. Half the fun is collecting the balls in canvas bags, then dragging them up to other levels to load into these cannons. Since the cannons face outward, there is no danger of hitting someone in the face with the balls. I have been other places where the cannons are on the first floor and can easily hit someone in the face, so this is a very important safety fact.My daughter loves the rock wall, which has several different climbing levels. My guess is that it tops out at 10 to 12 feet high, but it is challenging enough for novice climbers and maybe intermediates. I like how the areas are not enclosed, which provides a sense of freedom throughout the space. There is a small area in the back with vending machines for snacks and water.The staff is very professional, and readily available to answer questions. Free wifi is also available. We usually go in the morning when they open to avoid the crowds, which I have never personally witnessed because we spend up to two hours here before my daughter wants to leave for lunch. Since it's located in the mall, proximity is perfect, unlike other ""warehouse"" attractions.Overall, it's a nice place to visit to have low-key fun...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeeTrotman
30,Good Birthday Party Venue,"A good place for the kids to burn off energy. They'll be ready for a nap when you get home, as will you. I do wish they would run the A/C a few degrees cooler, but other than that, everyone has a great time. Good for Birthday Parties as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaryMargaretMcMertz
40,Fun for the Kids!,"Our granddaughter and her cousin celebrated their birthdays together will all their other cousins, parents, and uncles and aunties at Jump 'n Jammin. It is a kid paradise where they crawl up and down climbing towers, tubes, and webcrawls. There are foam ball blasters everywhere and the kids just loved it. A little bit tight for adults, but it's doable if you are still flexible and nimble. Can be very crowded on weekends.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/geotech522
50,Absolutely Amazing....,This was our first time here and we had an amazing time. My little boy had not played like that in years!!! This place sure made him smile. Two thumbs up!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/soniabear315
50,Good 1-2 hour active entertainment for the kids,"Great place to have the kids entertaining themselves with jumping, climbing, sliding, etc.Sometimes it is too crowded, but in general good place for the kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/57RobertB57
40,Awesome,I first heard of this place two years ago. Took me awhile to get there. It was awesome though. The kids loved it and I got quite a bit of exercise running around with them (although many parents just sit and watch). We spent the extra $3 on mountain climbing and my seven year old loved it.I can't wait to take the kids back and they can't wait to go back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/markwT471OW
40,Great Place for Kids Parties.,"While here in California we went to a childs birthday party there and it was just Awesome place for the kids and the adults to place and have a great time for 2 hours. One bonus feature for us was that all of the food served there has to come from our favorite plce to eat while in California, ROMA PIZZERIA. Didnt know this at the time but as soon as we saw that 28' Mega Pizza we knew it was from there. Your kids will Love this Place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChanceL_13
