30,Plenty of Candy but....,"I visited this location thinking I’d find some Blow Pops. Well, no such luck but it was kool just to see what all the hoopla was about regarding this place. There’s boxes upon boxes of various candy. They distribute candy but only put out some types of candy. There’s enough to choose from but for me, in terms of the “name brand selection” I wasn’t impressed. I guess a different selection of candy is put out depending on when you go. I went 2 days before Halloween so, I donno... I was thinking I was going to enter a warehouse w/rows & rows of candy. Kinda like when you go to a supermarket candy isle but w/discount prices. Don’t get me wrong, the prices are good, I just wasn’t impressed w/the selection.DON’T FORGET, BRING CASH !!! Only cash is accepted.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DaisyTraveler
