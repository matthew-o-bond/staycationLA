50,Not an Easy Hike but Great Views,"If coming in the summer, bring lots of sunscreen, a hat and extra water. It got very hot and there is no shade. We hiked up to the top to see great views of Zuma beach. Worth it and burned lots of calories. It's not an easy hike as it's straight up and part of the trail is sand.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adventuresahead
50,Fabulous views of Malibu,"My partner and I are runners and love to explore new areas. We were staying in the Santa Monica Mountains and around here and Malibu there are access to many hiking trails. There are maps easily downloadable online or you can pick them up at the local visitor centre, but you almost don't need them as all of the paths are well signposted and you can't go far wrong. We ran/walked for about 12 miles, it was extremely hot and tough going as some of the climbs were long and quite steep. However you could also pick much shorter routes/loops, from 1 mile upwards that were mainly flat or undulating. A lovely area with fabulous views of Malibu if you were prepared to climb a bit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/474debbier
50,My favorite hike,"This is my favorite hike in Malibu, it is a good up hill hike, with the most glorious views of the coastline you can imagine. What is also nice it is all up hill, so you get a great workout.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MikeinMalibu
50,Beautiful views,"I parked at the end of Bonsali road at the parking lot, took the Zuma loop trail, then the Canyon view trail and returned by the ocean view trail - it was perfect. I went on Monday morning and was probably the only person on the trail. Such a great thing. The views were amazing! It is quite a short trail but there is some elevation so it took me about two hours. Ideal for a quick morning hike!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TerunkaCZ
40,My Favorite Childhood Hiking Spot,"Enjoy the ocean breeze in the foothills. Hiking is great, but watch for snakes. After a great hike, head on into Malibu for some great eats.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dahuntraveler
50,Best training trails and canyons,Great trails complete with bathrooms and picnic tables. Parking is small but always seems that we can find a spot and we are there with a horse trailer. Great trails - lots of shorter trails and a long 12 miler we like to train on with our horses.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/saddLLP1
50,Zuma has nice hiking trails but Trancas is private,"There's no public access to Trancas Canyon, so visitors are instead advised to hike at Zuma Canyon (accessible at the end of either Busch Drive or Bonsall Drive; the latter has much more free public parking).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Newsdoc
40,23 creates motion sickness,Take your time on 23...lots of hairpin turns and 20mph speed limit. Some great views so be sure to stop and take a few pictures. Breathtaking view of the Pacific Ocean from up high!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/McFerrid
40,old California,What a great walk this place is reminiscent of the old California form my youth and lots of fun. Area has been maintained.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vonschmidt
40,Nice little hike,"Went for a solo hike during the week. There were a few others on the trail, so I felt safe, but it wasn't crowded. Beautiful landscapes. No bugs. Easy hike.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wine_Kitten1
50,Way uncrowded,"Sucha a great trail...This is a terrific hike. Dog friendly. pack out the dog poop/bags and keep our trails healthy.It's Uncrowded.PCH to Bonsal Drive and up to the end it. You can also access via Busch drive.Parking lot was closed when we came so we did street parking.Trailhead had a sign as well as maps...but don't count on available maps. Pay attention.This can be a gentle up to an intermediate hike wth some good ascent/incline.It's a good hike with several different trails: ZUMA canyon trail, ZUMA loop, Ocean view trail, etc. So you can spend several hours on the quiet uncrowded trails.Short hikes up to dbl mile digits.Great views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Summerasalifestyle
50,Stunning Scenery,"After spending a few hours at nearby El Matador State Beach, I went searching for a good spot to hike and stumbled across this jewel. I was one of only a handful of people on this trail... so peaceful. Upon arrival, some folks had just finished a hike with their horses and were loading them back into the trailer. I met a cyclist on the trail, too, so it's a multi-use trail system. I went up the Ocean View trail, came back across the Canyon View trail, and back down the Zuma Canyon trail. For an avid hiker, it doesn't get much better than this. This was one of the highlights of my day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DisneyF4
