40,The Walking Dead Attraction,"The Walking Dead” in universal City Plaza, a year-round attraction. Prepare to fight for survival as you navigate through a hungry walkers. Follow in the footsteps of the human survivors as you battle your way through nightmarish landscapes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/raminb446
40,This is not a hardcore walkthrough maze meant to really scare or terrorize you.,This is a pretty fun walk through of the walking dead theme that's definitely worth checking out.It's a fast attraction so the line moves and I've never waited with an Express pass. The walkthrough has employees stationed in the walkway to ensure that patrons don't touch any of the zombie actors. The zombie actors do get into the walkway area right up to you but of course don't touch you. It's more surprising shocks versus terror vibe that you'd expect from the Walking Dead show.The props of the walkthrough is where this attraction really shines. You almost want to stop and just each set out but the zombie actors come by quickly to snap you out of it. The background music definitely enhances the walkthrough experience vibe.This is not a hardcore walkthrough maze meant to really scare you. It's more of nice walkthrough with great props and zombie actors which enhance the experience. I'll swing by every visit because it's a fun and quick attraction. Enjoy!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ninong247
30,Scary,Walking through your greeted by very creepy people. Would not recommend for children. I was actually so scared That I had to leave in middle,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Storyteller708253
40,Short but scary,"This is not for the faint hearted, a great walk through attraction with live actors but a little short",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Duerds5
50,Very well done,We love the Walking Dead and this attraction did it justice. I don’t want to give anything away but it is definitely not for children or those easily scared. I think they are missing a trick by not having a gift shop....Rick Grimes would be proud,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/328russellr
30,Walking Dead Walkthrough,"This Walking Dead Attraction is a walk through with zombies trying to grab you....in the wait line the scenery looks like a battle field which is scary enough. It's like a haunted house that you walk through, like some other reviewers said, but it's fun and we laughed a lot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/865kg
20,haunted house,Fast line because it is not that exciting. It is pretty much a haunted house that you walk through. There are plenty of other attractions at universal that I would spend my time on. Parking at universal is $14 but plenty of parking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Icejap420
40,Fast Line!,We were at Universal for a few hours so opted for the Walking Dead Attraction since it had a very fast line. It is basically a haunted house with the Walking Dead theme. Kinda scary for little kids but the teenagers loved it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/misopiso88
50,Absouletly Brilliant,Being fans of the Walking Dead this was a great experience going from set to set we really enjoyed the way it was set up especially the Zombie actors they scared the hell out of us.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrianJ459
50,Cool for fans of the show,As fans of the Walking Dead we really enjoyed the Walking Dead attraction at Universal Studios Hollywood. Feels like you're stepping into an episode of the show as an extra.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/0221Serendipity
40,Ok Experience,The walk trough ended rather quickly but it was a good experience overall. The zombies scared the hell out of me even though I was looking out for something scary.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danielnabor648
40,Decent,"I’d say this walkthrough ride was more good fun than scary, although there were a couple of times where an actor dressed as one of the dead would run at you (FYI the actors aren’t allowed to touch you, only run at and try to grab you).Obviously a must for any Walking Dead fan, the prison set up in particular was amazingly accurate. Also the ending part with all the dead in the cages was very immersive. Even the queue to enter is a set up of the hospital from Season 1, so right from the get go you’re immersed.When we visited the waiting time was only 20 minutes and by the end of the day this had fallen to around 5 - although be warned that it does shut at around 7:30pm - so in terms of wait time it’s worth doing.Overall worth a ride if you’re a fan of/have watched the show!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H1326KRmatthews
40,Funny but short,"It's a short experience.The actors who play the zombies are very scary ;-) They jump out off dark zones :-)The jail is amazing. Feels as you're on the show.If you plan to go to the Studios just for that attraction, you may be disappointed, it's only about 3 minutes.But it feels great for a fan, even I expected more.Maybe they improve and extend it later as they did in Vegas.You're not allowed to take pics inside, but there's the complete walk-through on YouTube ;-)But if in the park, don't miss it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/misscalifornia1
10,save your time,really bad walk through save your time for another queue this is defo not worth waiting for and I like the show,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thomasHall1
40,Get ready to be startled,"The Walking Dead attraction is one where you simply walk-through... it is not a ride.Loud and complete with zombies of all sorts... animated, video based and human actors, they come at you and try to startle and scare you but do not touch you, of course you are not allowed to touch them either...If you enjoy the TV series, this is one attraction that you should try at least once.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lwj
30,RUN FOR YOUR LIVES!,"Would like to have been able to run for our lives, but you are SUPPOSED to walk. The kids I was with were running quite a bit. We were trying to play like the movie, but the group behind us seemed un-amused by our acting. The actors were great though!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andrewbmusic
40,Great Walk Through Haunted House,"The queue for this ride is the hospital from the first episode from Walking Dead. We haven’t watched the show in years but the attraction appears to follow the first few seasons of the show.We waited in the queue about 20 minutes before they sent us in with a group of 10-15 people. You start your journey like Rick, leaving the hospital, going in to town, making your way through the prison and then cages.You can tell when you’re near actors because there are Universal employees who are standing near them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DisneyTouristGuy
50,I LOVE IT,I had so much fun doing this!! im 11 yrs old and they let me in! its kinda scary! for me it was not too bad BUT..... if u get scared easily and younger than 12 and older than 10 then wait about 1-2 yrs! I DONT RECOMMEND THIS FOR 10 OR YOUNGER! PLEASE BE AWARE THIS IS ONLY ACTORS WEARING MAKEUP! THX BYE,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/djcoolgirlp
50,A Must For TWD Fans,"If your a walking dead fan, you won’t want to miss this attraction at Universal Studios Hollywood. Certainly not for younger children.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SixtyOne
50,Unique exhibit in Universal,"Before you go in you are warned 13 yrs old or older, I recommend you obey that warning. Unlike the other 3D ride, this one is a staged exhibit with real actors, which are all dressed as if they came out of a Walking Dead episode. They try to scare the inattentive loaner in the group and they manage to do that quite well. Several people will take the emergency exit without ever reaching the end, even though the whole walk is less than 5 minutes. I think it's a must see if you are a fan of the show or scary movies in general.Some tips: If there is a big line- come back later, since kids don't go in the lines gets shorter quicker. Walking in a very large group takes away from the experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ngap_82
50,Not for the faint hearted....,"If you’ve seen the show you will know what to expect.In the cold light of day this is just a walk though a building with actors trying to scare you.When you visit, walk through darkened corridors whilst actors in pretty good makeup try to scare you, I defy you and your heart not to feel something.Unfortunately, never having seen the show, my wife felt the need to leave via an emergency exit, so I can’t tell you how it ends!It’s a thrill walk.... enjoy, but be prepared!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LocalizerUK
50,love the Show and loved the attraction,Based on the first episode of Walking dead. Good effects. some things that bring back good flashbacks of the first episode :) I enjoyed it. Wasn't particularly scary. But I Still enjoyed it. My girlfriend on the other hand jumped quite a few times.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Steve_In_Ulster
30,Scary if you are in front,Based on the first episode this ride is just a walk through exhibit. As we were in the front it was quite scary for us not sure about the people in the back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sachin_Zarekar
50,Scary !,Never seen the show but the wait was only 15 minutes to get in so we decided to give it a try. Loved the crashed helicopter on top of the attraction. The hospital that they have the attraction in is done very well and is very creepy. Right before you enter to get in there is this very interesting piece of work. Be scared! As I for sure was!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rshaneel
50,"Big Fan, Can't Wait For Fall","Fall is coming and that means spooky mazes, zombie walks. This is a family tradition which began eight years ago, and now we go as a big teen party. Loads of fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MotherTravels
40,Very good and scary,The Walking Dead Attraction is based on the first episode of the series. It is a very good and scary walk through the hospital where actors dressed like zombies come out to scare you.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AntoNic7
20,Not impressed,"Walk through ride, not impressed at all. You see all the zombies that jump out in front of you due to line so not scared, should space out visitors, even though this would take longer",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/206douga
20,Not very impressed.,"Walked through with my 16-year-old son as we were heading out of the park since there were no lines whatsoever, so we figured why not. It reminded us of a kind of poorly done local haunted house you walk through. We certainly didn't understand the hype!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shawni_and_Buck
30,Not very scary,Walking Dead attraction is one of the attractions within the Universal Studios. The queues are usually long and takes about 25-30 minutes to enter. The whole attraction tries to scare you but things are predictable inside and not very scary. Would advise trying this at the end of the day only if you have time left. There are much better things to do spend time on,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/901aayushk
40,Good,"Good attraction and quite scary, but does not last very long. I would say it's probably 1 minute from when it starts to being out the other side!But overall goodfun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sionl303
40,amazing attraction!,"I had a lot of fun and the models made from the actual team from this hectic movie impressed me. (they looked pretty real). I had to stand in the line and honestly the longer I waited to get in, the scarier I became",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AndreaLynch21
40,A must for 'Walking Dead' fans,"We LOVE going to Universal City in Hollywood...we go at least once a year, and we were happy to find this attraction. Being ""Waking Dead' fans since day one, we had to do it, and we enjoyed it a lot.We didn't find it that scary, but the walk-through completely immerses you in the 'Walking Dead' world...great attention to details! And the cast who play the walkers are all great as well!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RollMeAway
40,Thrilling,Walk through exhibit and thrilling. I do not normally go to scary places but wanted to experience it. I was scared and found it was better to be in the middle. You can not touch anything but my reaction was to run but could not. This would be a great place for thrill seekers. I thought it was greatly planned but too scary for me.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jodymermaid
