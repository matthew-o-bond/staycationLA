50,Had a blast!,Came here for my Birthday and brought my family and a couple of my daughter's friends. We did the Sheriff room and had a great time. Although we didn't make it out in time it was a lot of fun for the whole family. I highly recommend as it involves everyone in your group to participate.This was my first experience in this type of game and I thoroughly enjoyed it. If you're looking for a great family time before or after magic mountain this is definitely a great choice.Thanks Unlocked team for a great experience. Next time we are in the area we will be back!,Eric I
50,Lots of mind bending fun at Unlocked,"Tried out Unlocked with a group of eleven people. We attempted the Mayfield Manor and had a great time. I love how the room was setup with a variety of mind bending puzzles.I was really diggin' their ""hint"" system and how they help you along if you get stuck. Overall we had a great experience, and would definetly want try out their other rooms.",tygerstile
50,"Friendly staff, awesome aesthetic and heaps of fun!","Never thought I would have such a great time solving puzzles! Everything is planned out creatively and in a way where it's not easy but not too hard. You have the option to get clues that will be given to you on a screen if you're struggling, and they'll know you are since they're watching you! There's a story and theme to each room, and do note that teamwork is required. Plus there's a special surprise if it's your birthday! Highly recommend.",Harrison T
50,Great family fun,"I came all the way from Miami, Florida. My group of 6 included 3 adults and 3 children. Everyone had a great time. Dave and Gary were fantastic. They explained the game in a way everyone could understand and be excited for. The game itself was challenging but fun for my entire group. I can't wait to go back and try another room!",DeLayna S
50,Totally worthwhile activity for out of towners!!,"I was excited we have an Escape Room in our own town! This was our first ever experience with an escape room and we were excited to try this.For our January birthdays we often look for something a little bit different and this fit the bill. We were not disappointed. We did the Mayfield Manor (Prohibition theme) for a dual birthday party, 8 of us in attendance.The prep before the room was also key and without getting info about the room, the two gentlemen running the store were very thorough to make sure we understood certain elements of the experience. I really wish I asked them their names, but trust me they are really easy to work with. The puzzles kept us thinking and challenged throughout the time we were in there. Some very fun surprises, too. The wrap up was equally thorough, we appreciated having more information.We had so much fun, I may request my work consider it for team building activities.We will return. To date they have three rooms with different themes and they mentioned a fourth room in planning stages. We look forward to another fun afternoon with Unlocked!",LadyKristine
50,There's gold in them there rooms!,"I was planning a trip to visit family when my sister asked me if I want to do an escape room with her and two of her genius friends. Well of course who wouldn't want to play with the smart kids! We booked the Sheriff's room at Unlocked Escape Rooms and had a blast! The puzzles were well thought out and put together. The gentleman that facilitated our 55mins was friendly, fun ad flattering. I would recommend this adventure to anyone!",MMT1203
50,Unlocked...an evening of fun!,"We just took on the challenge of the Professor's Basement and escaped. It was incredible! There were 4 of us in the group, and we've completed 10+ escape rooms to date. This one ranks in the top 3 hands down. It had the perfect ratio of puzzles/clues to solve and locks to open. All of the puzzles were very clever and nothing felt like busy work. The owners put a lot of thought into their puzzles. I would highly recommend Unlocked for an evening of fun!",lindsaymk887
