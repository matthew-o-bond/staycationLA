20,Best to Come During the Day,"Norwalk Town Square has been around a long time. It really needs to be renovated. It's anchored by a discount market and some second and third rate restaurants. I've gone here several times over the years to get batteries at the Radio Shack, work out at the 24 Hour Fitness and see movies at their discount movie house; the Regency. It's a place I would feel more comfortable walking around if I was carrying a Glock. It's hard to relax, because there are so many shady characters all over the place. There are a lot of large families, where everybody is overweight because all they can afford to eat is fast-food, and the kids are crying most of the time because their single mom won't buy them anything from the Dollar Store, because she needs money for cigarettes. There's a lot of threatening gestures like, ""Wait until we get home, carbon"" It's both very sad and comical.If during the day I don't feel very comfortable, I can tell you that at night I would avoid this place like the plague, unless I was very close to the movie theater. That place is almost an oasis, compared to the rest of the square.You'll never mix up Norwalk Town Square with the Brea Mall or The Block of Orange. That, I can promise you.Stay away if you can, unless what you need isn't close by. In that case, keep your car doors locked, with all your valuables hidden under the seats. Don't make eye contact with anybody. Mind your own business and act like you belong there. You shouldn't have any trouble.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LucianoLeon
30,Collection of Shops in Norwalk,"This place is actually a collections of shops in Norwalk and can run the gamut from a .99 Only Store, to a Starbucks, to an Avenue Clothing store, to a Bank of America. The point is, it is a diverse area that even offers a discount movie theater!Places like this are hard to rate because the stores are all run by different people and attract different types of people. How to put it delicately?? Some of the stores are definitely places you want to avoid and others are great!You can pretty much see for yourself which is which when you visit. Just know that some areas of this ""Town Square"" can be a bit dirty and have more teens present, maybe they might be rough-looking teens at that. So you probably want to avoid those areas whenever possible. Other places are fine to use.I would definitely avoid using the Bank of America here if you have a choice, it is not in a good spot and it always seems super crowded anyway. The Dollar Tree store is just average, seems a bit disorganized most of the time and the .99 Only Store seems the be the same. The Starbucks is just average but at least it is clean.Parking is just barely adequate for the number of shops, you might have a hard time finding parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fyremaven
30,"A glorious past, but no so much today","When we moved to Norwalk some 55 years ago, back then you could see the Norwalk Square sign from almost everywhere in the area. The growth of taller trees and bulking a has blocked that view. Kind of symbolic of the past glory of the Norwalk Square. In past times ( before Malls) the Norwalk Square was the place to go to shop. Unfortunately, the economic times and diversity of shopping alternatives has cause the Norwalk Square to diminish in popularity. The current flange of stores are no longer the hot spot to shop. The glory days have passed, but not killed the Norwalk Square. Good places to shop still exist and the Norwalk Square continues to serve the community well! Still love that Norwalk Square sign!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GaryI428
40,A terrific mall with many options,"This place is huge with shopping, dining and movies, enough to keep you busy all day and in or out of bad weather. There's a variety of large stores and small stores, from chains and specialty mom and pops. The dining is mostly low end. The movie theater is the best discount theater in SoCal with most movie ticket prices $1-2 depending on time of day and 3D.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kauai-Biz-Traveler
