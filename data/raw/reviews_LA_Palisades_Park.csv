40,Nice family place,"Visited on US trip with SOTC group. This park is located along the Ocean avanue in Santa Monica city spreading in a 26.4-acre area in Santa Monica, California. The park offers views of the Pacific Ocean and the coastal mountains. The park extends over 1.5 miles (2.4 km) from the Santa Monica Pier at the south to Adelaide Drive at the north. This long linear park is lined with plants and trees. There are benches, picnic areas and restrooms. A nice place for family picnic.",cp_0010
50,One of the most beautiful places in the world,"I don't think there is any more beautiful place to walk, run or just stop and look in the USA. No shops and stores, nothing but great scenery from tall cliffs that overlook one of the most beautiful bays in the wolrd.",Armen Pandola
40,Much improved,"Santa Monica has taken the problem of the park takeover by indigents and appears to have solved it. This week it was clear, and tidy and a pleasure to walk along and enjoy the scenery and sunshine",Wardieeee
40,Lovely place to walk,"It is the primo place to walk with the beautiful ocean. The gardens are delightful, sitting on the benches is fun and viewing the sunset is amazing especially in winter.",Sharon R
40,A great park for a scenic walk with Pacific Ocean and beach views.,"Whilst in Santa Monica I wanted to get some exercise and take in some of the scenery that the Pacific Ocean coastline can offer. So I headed to Palisades Park, a sizable strip of grass, palm trees & walking trails that features expansive ocean views. The park is around 1.7 miles in length and is a lovely place to walk in the Californian sun. There is a big old iron canon and also there is the Santa Monica Veterans Memorial (opposite Santa Monica Blvd.). There are quite a few homeless people in the park, many sleeping rough on the grass, which is a real shame. Worth a walk though.",Roberts69
30,So many homeless people,"There were a lot of people but not all of them were there for pleasure a large number of the people appeared to be homeless. Most benches were taken up with people laying sleeping on them. There were also people just laying on the grass or sitting around all looked to be homeless. It may of just been me but it made me feel a little unsafe; I guess I am just not used to seeing so many homeless people. There were also people walking dogs and people just out for a walk. I had seen programme on TV about the large number of homeless people in Los Angeles but to actually see up close and personal made it real, very sad that there doesn't seem to be much being done to help these people. I don't think I can recommend this as a good place to visit.",holiday-view23-7-11

40,Nice place to b the weekend......,"the place close to the sea is a perfect spot to enjoy the weekends, Is in the area between of Malibu and Santa Monica",John C M
40,Superb views,"We walked away from the pier at dusk as far as Lot 7 North. We crossed the highway by a foot bridge then walked up to the Palisades. Please note the paths on the cliff close at 6.30pm. I would expect it is probably not safe after then. Beware of holiday cyclists struggling up the slopes.After taking a seat to watch the sun go down, with fine views west from there we walked back to Santa Monica in 20 minutes. The atmosphere changed rapidly from holiday makers and sun worshippers to homeless people setting up for the night. Nothing bad happened but it was slightly menacing because you did not know where the next person was going to be and one does not want to walk through someones front room.",Catherine M
50,Lovely place for sunset and charming very Calif walk,"The bluffs are a lovely, charming walk thru palm trees and up above the Pacific Coast Highway with a gorgeous view of the ocean. You can picnic, exercise, read a book, walk a dog......",airbrush1212

40,Great walk,"This is a very long and narrow park along the beach. There are a lot of homeless people in the park, but besides that it's a very lovely walk.",Ali Van D
30,The walking path between Ocean Ave and the Beach and Pier,"The park is a nice green area between Ocean Avenue and the beach. It was quite well worn. Probably due to the many people who walk that path to and from the pier, like I did. In the morning it has quite a few transients that occupy the park, sleeping on the grass and using the restroom to wash.Many of the tour buses park near the pier along the park limiting parking spaces.",Deborah S-K
50,Relaxing park to take a stroll and take in the ocean view!,"Palisades Park is the perfect length for a nice, casual stroll along the beach cliffs to relax and enjoy the ocean view. It's light to medium busy depending on which day of the week you visit. The week-ends are a bit busier. It has a beautiful ""rose garden"" with the rose bushes blooming in the late spring, interesting sculptures and you can walk across the sky bridge to access the beach area.",Parvati P

30,Hmmmmm.....,"Read the reviews before going and will say that this is a beautiful park, with squirrels running around freely and there are some opportunities to take some breath taking shots. Personally would recommend walking through this place during the day.However, the number of homeless people sleeping and wandering in the park can at times leave you feeling a little uneasy, this for me was the only downside.",Pies

50,Love the view and the flowers,"I am very tired of the pier, but still love the views from this park. The flowers and palm trees are gorgeous. Even though there are times when it is quite busy, I still find it relaxing. It is wonderful to look out over the beach and to the ocean.",Skwiki
50,Glorious clifftop park,"I got up here after a long walk along the beach and it was perfect. Great views, lots of seating although not much is shaded, fairly good grass, lots of flowering plants, and many water fountains with refreshingly cool water.",mrdom
50,A Place My Tourist Friends Always Enjoy,"This is one of the most well-kept parks on the west side. The views of Santa Monica State Beachq are great and you can see the coastline forever --- from Malibu to the North to Rancho Palos Verdes to the South. The flowers, trees, and succulents are impeccably manicured, and if you want to amble or run, you've got an inner and outer path. Dog walking is popular as is people watching. Shaded areas are plentiful. One caveat. This is not a park of the NYC Central Park type. It stretches lengthwise 3 miles and is the width of three or four sidewalks. A great place to discover why people move to SoCal. Best time to visit are weekday mornings or afternoons. You can walk to the 3rd Street Promenade in no time.",Mary R
50,"Beautiful Area to Walk, Jog or Just Relax and Watch the Ocean",I made my own 5 K through this park along Ocean Ave. Nice dirt trail to travel on. Beautiful scenary and peaceful places to stop with pretty landscaping and it does not hurt that everything overlooks the Pacific Ocean. Pretty flowers and there is a nice area with several tables under a canopy of trees as well. Peaceful refuge.,Americanflygirl
40,Great place to walk,"This is a great place to take a stroll, we walked the whole length then crossed over the highway and walked back along the beach.There are lots of interesting sculptures etc to see in the park and lovely flowers and birds.",lillyKent
40,Good for walking and enjoying sunsets,Enjoy it most in the afternoon and early evening for a walk and getting some wonderful beach views and amazing sunsets.,RonWamberal
30,Would rate this higher except for certain issues,"This used to be a very nice park to walk in. It still is from appearances but there are some issues--people not picking up after their pets (which seems to be an issue all over not just here but it does detract from the park) and way too many people smoking weed where people are bringing their families, kids, etc. I would recommend people avoid areas where they congregate such as by the cannon. It brings down the enjoyment for everyone.",gjfromwa
40,Cliffs are eroding,"The walk along the cliffs of Palisades Park are easy to reach from downtown Santa Monica. Stretching for miles, you can easily walk and enjoy the ocean breezes. You will see homeless people sleeping under trees, but the area is largely clean. If you look over the edge, you can see the effects of weather and erosion - the walkway is completely gone and rerouted in one section.",CleopatraBunny
40,A beautiful stroll,"After strolling down Montana Ave. and passing by its small shops, you reach Ocean Ave. and a long Palisades Park high above the broad beach and the Pacific Ocean beyond. The path is flat and winding slightly in places. Rest rooms are available along the way towards the Santa Monica pier. It is a go to place for walking or jogging. In case you are hungry, there are many restaurants on the east side of Ocean Ave. and good areas to cross the street.",waterandmore

50,Great Park to view the beach! Great place to walk your dog away from traffic!,We have been to this cool park many times. This park is located past the pier on the way to Malibu away from Venice. There are cool places to sit and pathways to scenic views of the city and ocean. This park is also very close to the 3rd Street Promenade. Great place for any occasion! You can literally walk from this park all the way to Venice beach! There are a lot of park people ( homeless people) who do not have a place to live the closer you get to the Santa Monica pier so please say hello or give them a extra water or your spare change. The closer you get to Malibu the emptier the park seems! Many people walk their pets and jog this park! Lookout for the scooters and skaters it’s a prime location for any outdoor activity! Excellent view of the ocean!,Yehbut
40,Lovely respite,"This is a linear park...situated along the bluffs, above Highway 1 and the beach, and adjacent to downtown Santa Monica. It's basically a wide spot along the road, with a walking path and benches...and a beautiful overlook. We used this several times as a place to spend time while waiting for our family members to get done with a doctor's appointment! Parking is metered, and plenty of it.",Cello12345

40,"great views, lots of exercise classes around, sometimes a lot of homeless folks around","overall a beautiful view of the ocean, in the mornings there are a lot of groups exercising, but watch for homeless people in some areas.",ferdferd
40,Great views and great for relaxing,"Used to live a block from this park and went there daily with my infant daughter. Not a lot of amenities but the views are fantastic. Great spot to throw down a blanket and relax.For those commenting on homeless people, there are virtually no homeless people in the west end of the park. It's an area that's further from the tourist parts of downtown Santa Monica so I imagine most of those commenting didn't actually head down that far. In any case, went there daily...never felt unsafe.Also, scooters are banned in the park. You may see some there but you can get ticketed if you have a scooter in the park. And even if you don't, you will get some dirty looks.",Jason D
30,Nice place for a stroll,We strolled through the park on our way to the Pier. It has lovely views of the beach and ocean. There are homeless people camped out in areas of the park and sleeping on benches.,Jenny W

50,Lovely scenery,"The views of the beach at sunset were lovely from here. Be aware though that there are homeless folks living in this park and some apparently have no sense of modesty. One man, whose pants were drooping below his buttocks, decided to relieve himself out in the open by a tree. We had to steer our kids away to look at the lovely views from the park to avoid the not-so-lovely views of this man's parts. Otherwise, it's a nice place to take in the ocean views right by the pier.",TravelbugMelB2015

50,"Paradise on earth, or close to it","One of our favorite things to do is to get the dogs into the car and drive down to Palisades Park. It may be necessary to park a few blocks away, but it's worth it to stroll through the park,and the rose garden, and gaze at the ocean, and the sunset, if we've timed it correctly. The dogs always get very excited as we turn the corner from Montana Avenue, especially the shih tzu. Living near this, why do we take vacations?",Jcraiss
40,Scenic walk along the Pacific,"Palisades Park is a 25+ acre strip of land bordered by Ocean Avenue on one sideand the edge of the sandstone cliffs above Santa Monica Bay on the other. It offers a sense of serenity for people to enjoy as they walk, jog or bike on a path surrounded by trees, grass, shrubs and an incredible view of the ocean.If there is a negative to this area, it was all of the homeless who were sleeping and loitering in the park during the day.",lwj

50,Very nice park in Santa Monica,"Palisades Park is on the bluff of the Santa Monica beach. Very nice park to walk or take a jog along the paths. At one end the path goes to the Santa Monica stairs an the other end takes you in front of the Santa Monica pier. Lots of things to do on the pier (food, entertainment, etc). If you want some outdoor activities, this is your place to go.",mcorbin560
30,nice little park to walk thru but...,"On our way from the on street, metered parking to the SM pier we waked through this nice little park. Folks were walking, jogging and riding scooters through the area. We did find several folks that decided to ""stake a claim"" in the park for their personal use. They did not appear to be residents of anywhere else so I guess this works here. We enjoyed the views.",Jerseybob175
20,"Beautiful, but Overrun by Homeelss","Absolutely beautiful park with well manicured grounds and views second to none. However, the park has been taken over and over run by the homeless population. 90% of the benches are the permanent sleeping quarters during the day for this group.

50,Beautiful views,"Could be called the Santa Monica Promenade, because it is located above the Santa Monica Beach atop a cliff and offers beautiful views.

40,Beautifully Maintained & Groomed,"Our Accommodation was across the road from this park and it was delightful to look out, see the Park & ocean beyond. Santa Monica is home to a large number of ""homeless ex-veterans"" who are well cared for here, but no matter how much accommodation is offered to them, quite a large number still prefer to bed down for the night under their favourite tree. It is not, in the least disturbing, but I believe the park is so well maintained and cared for because of this.There are truly amazing views from this Park, day and night. It is utilised very well by joggers, strollers, bikers, and just people in general, PARTICULARLY just prior to sunset as the Park sits high above the shoreline and allows a huge number of people to take photos of a stunning view.",ChristinaMCGM
50,An elegant park with a birds eye view of the beach and steps away from shops and food,"Palisades Park is a sliver of a park sandwiched between Santa Monica's Ocean Front Drive and the beach below. Several stairs and passageways let you travel down to the sand, should you want to. However, the elevation change gives the park and its higher perch a world class vantage point of the beach, the ocean and sunset views. The narrow park has winding paths and is dotted with interesting trees. Directly across the street, you'll find restaurants, hotels and just three blocks away is the famous 3rd St. Promenade with shops and street performers. But there's plenty of time for all of that....make sure you grab a park bench in the park and soak in the world class view.",lwturner

For that you need to stand on the bluff overlooking the Pacific, high above Santa Monica Beach.

It is mostly walkway and foliage, so there isn't much else to do but observe the sights or play Pokemon Go.

50,Best place for a run in the morning and watching the sunset in the evening,The park goes from the pier entrance all the way up through north Santa Monica. The view is always spectacular with the palm trees and the beautiful ocean below. The best place in all of Santa Monica. The only downside is the large population of homeless people who are occasionally aggressive.,etkt2016

40,A beautiful view!,We took this path on a daily basis on our recent stay in Santa Monica. We always felt safe and loved the view out over the ocean. We had a picnic in the park one of our days and it was glorious in the sunshine. There is many homeless people.,Lisa W

50,Make it part of each day in SM if you can!,"Well kept beautiful park, spectacular views, places to sit, plenty of public restrooms and water fountains. Beach access via stairs (many steps - some steep and bridges over Pacific Coast Highway. Many people walking, running, walking dogs or just taking in the view. Great for sunsets. Often you can see dolphins breaching the surface of the water and I'm told whales as well on occasion. As you get closer to the pier, the number of the homeless population increases - just ignore them!",78chevy

This little stretch is so beautiful with its sweeping panoramic view of the Santa Monica Bay, beaches, Palos Verdes Peninsula, Santa Monica Mountains and Catalina Island. This is well worth the time it takes to stroll and breathe in the fresh air. It is also a great place to have a picnic or lunch away from the office.

40,Great Park for all,"The Palisades Park is located between Ocean Avenue and the Santa Monica Beach. It is a great place for jogging, walking, or sitting to enjoy sunset on the beach. The palm trees and flower bushes along the walking path make the park more of the big garden, not just a green space. The area next to the Pier Gate is usually popular for street performance. There are plenty of benches to sit and enjoy people and the beach, then travelers can cross Ocean Avenue to eat at many good restaurants or shop at the Mall.",Prawet J
50,Gorgeous .....,One of my favorite places to watch a sunset... especially at the northern part called inspiration point! I went here with my Dad the other day we had a great time.

50,Cliffhanger of a stroll!,This is a magnificent stroll or run or just sitting on a bench! It's an amazing view because you are high up from the beach what seems like an unending cliff. It's really quite spectacular and worth seeing. The park in beautifully maintained and all the palm trees are so beautiful and tropical that you can easily forget where in the world you are.,livingdolcevita
50,Take a Stroll in Palm-shaded Sunshine!,"If you're anywhere near Santa Monica, you will want to stroll in this well-maintained park overlooking the beach and sparkling Pacific. We never a miss a chance to join the walkers, runners, bench-sitters, newspaper readers, chess players, etc. who enjoy exercising or just hanging out along the palm-shaded paths at this L.A. icon . . . in any weather, although sunshine is nice!",SonomaValleyWoman
40,Beautiful park but...,"I witnessed several people that appeared to be homeless/mentally challenged. They were not bothersome but were foraging through the garbage and sleeping on the grass. They have a right to be in the park. It is not comfortable to be in their presence when one is attempting to enjoy the scenery and beauty of the park. Also, it was packs of runners parading through the park, way to many running together taking up space on the small trails.",nyfriend
40,Worth a walk,Shame about the number of homeless people sleeping on the benches etc. Great view though and lovely flowers.,Ellie G
40,A Photographer's Delight,"This is not actually a Park, but a two or three mile meandering walkway, that is filled with lovely shady trees, with above-the-ground curvy roots, Cannons, Statues and Monuments. The elevated path above the bluffs gives people spectacular views of the Ocean, the Beach and the iconic Santa Monica Pier.The Park is clean, and is nicely maintained. In the early morning, it is serene, peaceful, and a place of solace. Many emotions are experienced as you walk along the Park -- The natural beauty amazes you, the gorgeous scenery dazzles you, and the homeless people everywhere sadden you.We enjoyed several strolls along the park in the mornings and in the afternoons, yet, never got tired of the scenery. It is the best area to view drop-dead gorgeous sunsets. And, do not forget the Route 66 sign on one wall of the hut that is the Visitor’s Center, directly across from the pretty blue building of The Georgian Hotel.There are lots of great Hotels and Restaurants across the street – many of them with windows overlooking the park and the ocean.Take the walk, at least once, if you are in the area.",TheExplorerFamily
40,Awesome Elevated Sunsets- Inspiration Point- the Northmost Overview Part of Palisades Park,"Try the northmost part which is a nice 80 foot elevation above the Pacific Coast Highway #1. We got there by walking up the ""secret steps"" from Estrada Drive then west on Ocean Drive to the overlook. We got there a few minutes before sunset and enjoyed ~15 of the sunset and beautiful afterglow. Nice residential neighborhood.

30,Nothing special.,It's a park near the sea and I guess the sunset is as spectacular from here as it was from my room at Shutters or indeed from a beach bar on Clearwater Beach. If you want somewhere nice and green with a bit of atmosphere to walk around this fits the bill.,felipehavana
30,A study in contrasts,"Looks very nice from a distance - but - it would appear the visitors (local or tourists) think of the edge (cliff side) as a rubbish dump. The council needs to start a real clean up of the cliff face. The park itself is a contrast - lots of lovely views, lots of activity of interest, but - a number of either homeless or beggars wandering around - a few touts trying to sell things and religious nutters trying to convert anybody passing. However it was a nice walk that could benefit by a few more seats (several were obviously home to some of the homeless) - so contrast everywhere - which made it interesting - best point was the views available",Grant N
40,Palms and beach overlook,"This is a lovely place to take a short of long stroll with a friend or family under the palm trees and to enjoy the overlook to the beach and ocean below. An excellent place to take pictures. Dogs on a leash are welcome.Beautiful condos line Ocean Avenue, providing a very pleasant atmosphere. There is usually a nice breeze.",Nels C
50,"There is something for every one who wants a walk, a run, or a jog with your dog.","After a great dinner at Dina's Diner in Culver City, we usually drive over to the cliff in Santa Monica to walk off the meal. It's beautiful and never really crowded. You can sit and watch the ocean or walk around the wonderful plants and trees. If you want just to contemplate the quiet of the ocean or people watch, I highly recommend the Pacific Palisades Park of Santa Monica.",David_DeMulle
50,Stunning Views,This park has stunning views! I was so impressed with how clean and well maintained it was. And I was so excited to see a Great Egret hunting in a garden a couple feet from the sidewalk. At first I thought it was a statue. Beautiful morning stroll.,2013Wren

50,Beautiful Park over looking the Pacific Ocean,The park from my childhood where young and old enjoy the outdoors. The park sits atop a 150 ft cliff looking out towards the west and the Pacific Ocean. Santa Monica has done a great job maintaining the area and keeping it fresh and beautiful. One end has a totem pole and the other the Santa Monica Pier .In between is a canon used during World War II to protect the area if it needed it. Also there is a stone monument honoring Mr Jones and commenting the sunsets he used to watch from that spot. Walk and enjoy the whole length of it.,nancy n
40,Nice views - still smaller than I thought,"We did a nice loop by walking through this little park, made some nice pis of the beach, strolled back on the beach. Park is much smaller than I had thought.Only would go if you plan to visit the pier or downtown - not for an extra trip.",Rennmaus111
40,Palisades Park is awesome north of Wilshire,"Palisades Park is excellent place only if you are North of Wilshire Blvd due to homeless loiterers near the Pier. There are stairs with access over PCH that will end on the beach side of PCH from Palisades Park.Palisades Park is nice in these areas for walking, jogging, enjoying the view of the ocean. There are benches that overlook the water and nice paths. People walk their dogs, exercise, and enjoy the rose garden when in full bloom. Montana St. is just off Palisades Park and a great area to shop, have frozen yogurt (Menchies), and hang out in an upscale neighborhood, although you would need to walk about 7 - 9 short blocks.At the end of the park, north of Montana the street curves and is nice to walk and if you zip down towards the beach there is a tunnel that goes below PCH to the beach, there are a few steps but easy enough to walk a bike to the beach bike path. There are also beachwear shops, restaurants, and a small liquor store for sodas and snacks if you wish to avoid taking the Pier route to the bike path and beach.Do not take the California Incline down to Pacific Coast Hwy unless you are in a car or motorized vehicle, there is not an easy way to cross PCH without getting ticketed.",L B

On a clear day you can see Catalina Island to your south.",rebwriter

50,Palisades Park,"One of my all time favorite things to do when I come to Santa Monica, is walk the entire length of the park. It overlooks the Santa Monica beach and pier, amazing view of the ocean, boardwalk, pier and some unique homes on the beach. There are usually bikers, joggers and lots of people doing group yoga in the park, families picnicing, couples lounging and of course a lot of homeless. I've never been bothered at the park in the 10 years I've been coming back to visit many times and enjoy it alone, with friends and on business trips. You can walk over the walkway to the beach. Its a must do item when coming to Santa Monica I highly recommend enjoying this beauty.",Pastridge

50,The place for sunsets,My family and I strolled along Palisades Park and watched the sunset as we made our way to the Pier. We were surprised by its existence (on maps I'd looked at there was no indication of cliffs) and delighted. You get a view of the beach and the ocean from high along cliffs. Simply breathtaking.,AlexanderD
20,Could be so much more but it's a homeless camp,"They have an amazing view, but this park has too many bad smells from homeless people. I thought so last year, and again this year when I returned. I no longer stay in SM when I visit the area.The waterfront in Santa Barbara is so much more nice and vibrant. And pleasant! There are a few homeless there, but you don't get this sense like you do in SM that the homeless have taken over the park.This city should be ashamed that they don't do more for their homeless. Allowing them to camp out for free is enabling. And I believe there are health risks for everyone involved.",moonslice

40,Very Nice Evening Stroll Over-looking Santa Monica Pier,"Palisades Park is along Ocean Avenue and overlooks the Santa Monica Pier and Beach. It's has a nice paved walk that is perfect for an early evening stroll when the cool ocean breeze wafts through the air (good to have a sweater or light jacket in the evenings as it can get chilly). There are some military monuments to all 50 states, which is fun to explore, but basically it's a nice little park in the middle of busy Santa Monica.

Sunsets from this vantage point can be pretty darn spectacular but unless you have little ones, I recommend staying far away from the rides and arcades on the pier. Everything seems a bit ""tired"" and dated, needing a major sprucing up, and the restaurants are nothing special. Instead, wander along the walking path and take in the sea breeze and the scenery.",WestsideL

Yes, there are many urban campers in the park, but they do their own thing.We enjoyed the sunsets most of all, and it is so cool to see so many people stop what they're doing, dash over to the park and have a serene moment as we all watched the sunset into the Pacific Ocean. Beautiful views, great place for photos. A must see when you're in LA.",SandBAtlanta
40,Stellar view of the Pacific coast,"A stretch of green space above the freeway, Palisades Park runs parallels to the Pacific coast at the higher elevation, so it offers a spectacular view of the pier, the beach, and the coast! Especially on a beautiful sunny day that is typical in SoCal, walking in Palisades Park is a relaxing experience to be had.However, there are many homeless people that call this place home and though all of them mind to their own businesses, you probably don't want to idle here at nighttime by yourself.There are plenty of parking around that is free for the first 90 minutes or so, so I recommend coming from Third Street Promenade and walking through this park to reach the Santa Monica Pier!",jayyen93

40,Wonderful but a bit seedy,"You have seen this park in a thousand movies since the 50s. It is nicely laid out and the views of the Pacific and the monumental palisades are gorgeous. Lately, it appears not as safe as it once was with homeless guys pretty much taking over some of the best spots to stop, rest and enjoy the view.",Janice O
40,Great for a jog in Santa Monica,"With options of paved paths or compacted dirt, I loved jogging in this park. There were plenty of people, but also enough space that there were few pedestrian traffic jams. The view off to the ocean was lovely, and there are basically no street crossings to slow you down!In general, it was rather clean, though I didn't visit the restroom buildings, so can't speak to that aspect.Also, if you're uncomfortable around homeless people, you might not want to visit the park.",Jenny_in_Palo_Alto
50,Great park to stroll along with dropdead views of the ocean.,"I have strolled along this park hundreds of times. I never get tired of the view which is the sparkling Pacific Ocean. Some days it literally looks like 1 million diamonds on the horizon. Some days you can see all the way to Catalina. I love walking alone ...watching people with their dogs and kids, old people, young people...it is a very Zen place to stroll along.",AFoolForTravel
20,"Like the walking dead, but with vagrants","Don't get me wrong here. Homeless people are people too. I don't expect to take a trip to indulge a fantasy that homelessness does not exist. But Santa Monica has a massive problem with the homeless. It really detracts from the experience because I could not walk a block without either being solicited or witnessing some baffling and sketchy behavior. You just are bombarded all the time with it. I had to head to downtown L.A. to get a break from it. People following you into coffee shops, passing out in the middle of the street, etc, etc. Hey things happen sometimes but when they are happening every 5 minutes 24 hours a day it's just too much. Especially when you just come to get some sun and relax a little. Palisades itself would be a great park if you felt like you could sit on the grass without worrying about getting jabbed by a hypodermic needle. Or avoid disturbing some guy on the grass who is sleeping on the grass with all his possessions next to him. It was a funny contrast with the wealth and poverty put side by side constantly. Even visiting your own city's slum areas I feel you will feel less awkward than coming here. Sorry Santa Monica. I desperately want to like you but damn. Get it together.",PenguinPie
30,Yes to Me Its Also A Green Walk.,"Just along side of the Santa Monica beach this green area is Palisades park.Yes to me also like another traveller ,its a green walk.Well strolling here is great and you can also relax on the benches and have views of sea,sun and mountains.",Naureen Y

40,Peaceful,Really like this park. It grows on you. It's long and narrow but seriously the best spot to view the Californian sunsets. You can go jogging and do whatever. Worth a stroll around and people watch. Definitely watch the sunset.,EggChen
20,Long green walk,"I wouldn't call this a park, more like a long green walk. I gave this a low rating, because of two things. The first was that there were quite a few homeless lying around, especially near the pier area, which didn't make it an appealing sight. The other annoying thing were the demonstrators, and I'm sure their cause was just and genuine, but which annoyed the crap out of me. The speaker was extremely loud and I really didn't think it was appropriate to describe all the horrible abuse and suffering in such detail. This isn't the right place for it. And rather than getting my sympathy, I just got really annoyed about it, which spoiled the rest of the walk. I wished that girl with the lovely singing voice has been able to drown out the laments of the demonstrator.Apart from that, the 'park' is a long walk along the coast with a bit of greenery alongside it. I prefer walking on the beach, to be honest, where it's a bit quieter.",Kiwigirl341
40,Beautiful place to stroll.,Palisades park is not what one would normally think of as a park. There are no playgrounds or ball fields. It is a wide strip of grass that runs above the ocean along Ocean Avenue in Santa Monica. There are walking paths and some monuments. There are beautiful views of the Pacific Ocean from the edge of the park. It is a peaceful place to walk and relax. Also good for dog walking. It runs all the way from Santa Monica to the pier.,Morris K

30,"Beautiful views, but sadly cannot be properly enjoyed",We walked through this park several times during our trip to Santa Monica. The views of the pacific were lovely and the lawns were manicured. The problem was we found it impossible to walk along and truly enjoy the views and scenery when there were so many homeless people in need laid around on the grass. There were also a lot of people constantly trying to stop you to sell you a tour of some description which got pretty annoying.,Pip-F1
50,Excellent walking,Beside the pier at Santa Monica is palisades Park. The linear park is on the cliffs above the beach. Shady manicured. Plenty of entertainers in the busy places in the park.

50,An ideal Southern California coastal stroll,"When you picture the California south coast, do you think of wide beaches, ocean vistas rimmed by hills, subtropical vegetation, gnarly trees and seaside cliffs? If you nodded ""yes"" to these, make time for Santa Monica's Palisades Park for a few hours and enjoy all that at its best. Try to walk the full length. It's an easy 1.5 miles north from the pier along the cliff edge; no hills, lots of benches, food trucks by the south end. If you also picture weak cliffs prone to sliding, you'll see that too. In a number of places, new path sections plainly skirt where earlier ones fell to rubble. This makes the park both a delightful stroll in its own right and a graphic geological reminder that you're not in Kansas anymore.",David K

The park is full of life with people doing yoga, tai chi, stretching, walking, running with and without their dogs. Women marching with a power latte in hand.On most Sunday's by the rose garden is a band that plays mixed music that some dance to. A lovely lady in her 90's asked me to dance with her one day.

50,Bruce Springsteen and Fireworks!,"At the beginning of darkness on July 3 we arrived in Palisades Park to view the fireworks from below. There were only a few of us but we were ready. Just before the fireworks began we could hear the distinctive sound of Bruce Springsteen (The Boss) and it was not recorded. We were looking at him on stage. The sound made its way up clearly to our positions above Pacific Coast Highway. Then the stage went silent and we could see the fireworks in the distance over Santa Monica Bay. We could actually see two events at the same time and the music from the stage below was part of the fireworks! After 25 minutes, the fireworks were over and Bruce returned to the stage and the small numbers of people remaining at the club.Palisades Park is a marvelous park without this special event once a year. It gives all visitors a great view of the pier and Santa Monica Beach below. It is a great place to run, walk, exercise your dog or ride your bike. Don't miss it day or night.",Mitchel N

This is where the famous Route 66 ends. A small monument can be found detailing the information. A public bathroom is available but it's used so much it was really bad. You'll see a number of homeless people sleeping in the grass. None was a bother to anyone. Palisades Park is the entrance to the Santa Monica Pier area.

50,Beautiful,"This is a really lovely old park, especially early in the morning before the main crowds of homeless crawl out of their dumpsters and start fighting. North, further away from the Pier end is especially nice as it feels safer and the beautiful old trees are under less pressure from the crowds. Grab a coffee at McD's on Colorado, and if you can make it to the corner without getting mugged you can take a very nice long stroll along the bluff. But go early.Tip: If you see a homeless dude with a skateboard be very wary as he may try to shoot it into your feet as you walk past and trip you over so he can mug you while you are on the ground. We saw two attempts made on the one day, but the intended victims were clearly locals and dodged the board with hardly a missed step. Quite impressive reflexes.There is a lot of high speed bike traffic on the dual use cycleway/footpath, so keep an eye on little kids or they may get mowed down by some hipster blasting through on his way to his conflict free, vegan, hot organic, shade grown soy pilates class. You don't hear them coming, you just hear a faint 'woosh' as they fly past leaving a vortex of spinning homeless in their path.There are usually a few burrito trucks parked on the West side of Ocean which along with the Camera Obscura building seems to be where the main crack dealing goes on. The South end by the Pier entrance is where the highest population of weirdo's congregate, and we were treated to a very special Sunday afternoon in our hotel listening to a group protesting about illegal Chinese human organ harvesting. That was awesome. All afternoon. Non stop. Not even the crowds of crack smoking fighting homeless could put a damper on their screeching and wailing about something that the surging crowds seemed totally mystified about, and totally indifferent to. But they seemed into it, and that is the main thing on a sunny Sunday afternoon at the park. Fortunately we had paid a LOT extra for our Ocean View Premium Balcony Eco Suite, so we had the full benefit of their presentation. All afternoon.Right by the Pier entrance a group has a small live animal show. They have large birds in small cages, snakes, and all sorts of poor wretched creatures that makes you want to phone for a PETA SWAT squad to fly in and do the human gene pool a big favor. You can't miss it. Unfortunately.There is a public restroom attached to the Camera Obscura building. Between the smell, and the inhabitants I personally wouldn't go in there. Use the McD's on Colorado.",Elwood_Seattle

The homeless men don't even disturb the scenery. When I die, I want to be cremated and my ashes scattered under a palm tree at Palisades. Wait a minute! Homeless men? Forget it. Just keep walking.

40,Nice view and walk,We took a walk here in the mornings. A great way to start your day. Beatiful view and a well taken care of park. Take the satirs down to the ocean for a coffee and finish your walk by the beach.,Anneochmagnus
50,Extremely Beautiful.,"The view from this park is not rivaled in the world. Amazing sunsets. Beautiful ocean and mountain scenes.Unfortunately....it is loaded with homeless people. Lucky for them to be in such a beautiful place but a bit scary at times for others. You do have the screamers and shouters and you are not sure what to do .As a woman, I cross the road and leave. Too bad it takes away from the wonderful park.",Flhappy
50,Strolling Along the Clifftops,"If you have never been to Santa Monica, this is absolutely a Must. I have been visiting the park for over 50 years. What is rally unique about it is the vistas from the winding path that borders the cliff tops at least 50 feet above the Coast Highway. The park stretches several miles and is an aboretist's joy with towering palms, rose and succulent gardens. There is also some rather amazing gnarled old olive trees. One can park along the street (Ocean Ave) and picnic anywhere although most of the picnicking is of the blanket on the grass type. The views stretch north to Malibu and south to the Santa Monica Pier and beyond. And if one is particularly energetic, there are scattered paths down to the Highway and across to the beach. Or one can simply walk a few blocks and arrive at the Third Street Promenade. I never feel unsafe walking this beautiful boardwalk during the day and it is a particularly beautiful spot to catch a sunset over the ocean. Recommend a couple of hours for a gentle stroll.",Christie C
50,Haven for the homeless,"Do not be put off by the large number of homeless people at the park. They did not bother me when walking alone and one person kindly told me I had dropped my sunglasses, other wise I might not have noticed when fumbling with the camera. The toilets were clean on the occasions I needed to know with soap, water, paper and even toilet seat covers; Australia please note. The views are expansive and it is real postcard stuff.

40,Beauty of Santa Monica,The boardwalks around Santa Monica's beaches are beautiful but you can also walk in this park above sea level. Or jog or take a bike.,Katrin S
40,Nice cliff side walk,"This park was an excellent surprise to the end of my route 1 trip. I decided to stay the night down the street and ended up walking the entire Santa Monica area; this park provided excellent shade and views.There are lots of comments on here about homeless people in the park, which is a very true statement but I was not approached by any of them. The numbers don't lie, there is probably a homeless person every 10ft. Don't even worry about it!Comments:Easy access to the beachEasy crossing of the highwayWonderful shadeBathroomsDrinking fountains",Matt
50,Fantastic views,Walk along here on a regular basis when visiting my Son and his Family we are usually heading for the Pier with my two young Grandchildren but en route you are entertained by keep fit fanatics doing all sorts of moves mixed in with this are the rough sleepers which surprisingly Santa Monica authorities seem to except which comes as quite a pleasant suprise close to the entrance to the Pier you will see street Entertainers certainly worthy of a visit.,Pauline T
40,"Loved the Park & the Views, Minus the Homeless","I'm sure that this is a sensitive topic, so I will be gentle and respectful. We stayed for a week on the beach in Santa Monica. We loved it there, and we loved walking in the Palisades Park, both during the day, and at sunset. It's gorgeous! The landscaping is beautiful, and the views of the Pacific Ocean, Santa Monica Mountains, and the Santa Monica Pier are breathtaking. However, the hundreds of homelessness that linger there makes it hard to relax. Now I know, they are having a far worse time than I am with my comfort level. But they are occupying most benches, sleeping all over the grassy areas, and the smell of urine and body odor is ever present. Not to mention that you will witness the sad signs of mental illness. It's quite sad! Now there is a police presence and a maintenance crew that keep things tolerable, but it's hard to enjoy yourself when there's so much suffering near by. I don't know the solution, nor do I care to debate it, but if I'm going to rate this park, it does have to be mentioned. Other than that, the place is beautiful!",Im-Batman1971
30,Sleep it off,"I work one block from this park and walk over during my lunch breaks a lot. True, there in an amazing view of the bay and the pier and the coast. Amazing. The manicured lawns are also a perment home for lots of homeless people those who ""partied"" too hard and some who arr currently exploring other worlds. Its a public shame. The farther north you go toward Pacific Palsades the nicer it is. The closer to the pier, the more colorfull.",Jack S
30,Lots of homeless napping,"A nice view and an easy stroll, but somewhat uncomfortable with beggars. The pier is nice and there are some good food stops there. The steps of the bridge over the street to the beach smells strongly of urine.",Snagwam

40,Perfect for a stroll with stunning views!,"There's never a bad time to visit this park. Set above the coastline, your eyes will thank you for choosing this place for a stroll. You'll see many joggers, walkers, friendly dogs around here. Best times are morning or near sunset. You can also see the Santa Monica Pier below which is a nice little treat in my opinion. The plants, palms, and small points of interest make this place great. Look for metered parking but this can sometimes be a challenge depending on time of day.",Caroline L
40,A Great Stroll,"Palisades Park is perched above the Pacific. It is quite extensive. The breeze coming off the water keeps you cool on hot days. There are joggers, sometimes a movie being shot, and in general a fun place to walk.",Jeremy T

40,A great place to walk and the best part of Santa Monica,"Stretching from the pier right along the coastline at Santa Monica, Palisades Park is probably the best thing in Santa Monica and it free. A walk along it will take an hour or more each way and there is plenty to see. Bordered by ocean drive on one side and the beach on the other, it has street musicians, statues, pretty flowers, old cannon, and some of the strange characters that wash up there. THE must if visiting S. M.",Mel B
40,What a view!,"This park begins at the Santa Monica pier. Its a terrific place to do people watching and catch a great sunset! There were various food trucks parked at the curb along the park. Don't even enter the public restrooms - OMG - what a horrific, nasty mess!",Napunani
50,I feel in Love at first sight,"Palisades park is beautiful. I walk my dog down the long path parallel to the breathtaking and vast Pacific Ocean. It is so relaxing and gorgeous here!There are benches to sit if I get tired, and ta times I just sit and reflect in awe at the beach before me.It does get crowded on weekends and mobbed on holidays.I suggest trying one of the cafes on Ocean Ave. after a long walk in the park.A perfect way to spend an afternoon.",Shana S
50,Nice place to stroll,You can get a lovely view of the ocean and the SM Pier from the park. It goes for quite a ways up from where the SM Pier starts.,TucsonGrammy
50,Running/walking destination park,"I give this park five stars because it is frankly one of the two perfect places for a run/walk on the planet...well, at least that I've found (the other is Regent's Park in London). It is green, beautiful, flat, well lit and well populated for an evening run, and features dirt paths that are easy on aging runners' feet. I've run here in the very early morning and evening, when it's almost always cool enough for a great workout, due to the ocean breezes. While there is Ocean Avenue traffic on the East side of the park, the breezes coming in from the ocean mitigate any pollution from that side, and add a welcome effect when you're working up a sweat. If you're horrified by the sight of homeless people, you should know that there are always a few asleep on benches and grass. But there are so many exercisers from casual walkers, to old people, to serious athletes, that one never feels unsafe. I love this place.",FoxVoyage
50,Great view and people watching!,"I loved the scenery, live music, and people watching! Great place to stroll, walk the dog, or view the coast from up above.",Joy D
50,Great park,Great Park with lots of grass and palm trees plus some weirdly shaped trees resembling large scale bonsai. Views from the Park over the beach are amazing. Great place to watch the sun set,theellitts
50,Best sunset in Santa Monica,"Santa Monica as a whole can be over hyped but Palisades is a beautiful park! The park extends north-south with the beach to the west and ocean ave to the east. Sitting high on a bluff you are actually looking down toward the beach which makes for better views. The whole place is very well taken care of and there is a walkway for runners, benches to relax, and plenty of shade under the massive palms. This is an excellent place to go for Sunset! You can see north to Malibu, due west to the ocean, and slightly south are good views of the pier.",Brad S

40,Lovely park and great for sunsets,"This is a very pleasant, long narrow park on the bluffs above Santa Monica beach. It is full of tall, elegant palm trees and Mediterranean as well as sub-tropical plants. There are also lots of lawned areas. It has lovely views up and down Santa Monica Bay and over the beach and towards the sea. It's a great place to view the sunset. It is very relaxed and perfect for a range of activities such as easy walking, jogging, sitting and reading on a bench or on a lawn. It also attracts people meditate, do yoga and various other exercise regimes.",traveloholics
30,Lots to see and do!,"Crowded on the weekend days, if possible a great time to go during the week. There is construction going on on the pier itself right now and cuts the walk area in half on some parts of the pier. Beautiful at night with all the different colors. Try to get to the end of the pier at sunset, it is worth seeing. Mostly family oriented with rides which again on the weekends is very crowded. Right past the drive to the parking on the pier itself there is a little stand that sells route 66 t-shirts that are great quality not regular tshirt material. You have to do it at least once if you are in the area. Better restaurants off the pier make sure you check the grade of the establishment if you do decide to eat there. Only fees are to ride the rides but just walking on the pier is free.",Bankerchic77

It is obviously a popular place for people to exercise and walk their dogs. However, there were a number of people sleeping rough under the trees when we visited, which was a surprise for us (being our first visit to the US), especially in such an affluent area.",opgp
50,End of the rainbow,You can start in Jacksonville Beach in Florida and never get off the 10 freeway until you reach this gem of a park in Santa Monica. It's got a spectacular view of the sunset over Malibu and the cleanest air in Los Angeles County. But it is the majestic palm trees and the golden light as the sun sets (seen to maximum advantage here) that lures countless souls to commit to a life on the California coast.,Scott M

20,Hard to enjoy this lovely spot,"This park has a lot going for it. We visited about 12 years ago and remembered walking and jogging through the beautiful park overlooking the Pacific.On this trip were looking forward to showing our kids this lovely spot. Yes the lovely park is still there but so are dozens of homeless people dotted around the park every 20 yards or so on the grass, on benches, by the road. I know it is not their fault but as a tourist spot it has become unpleasant. The kids felt uncomfortable being there so we left.A great shame. Glad we decided to stay in Beverly Hills this time.",GeorgieA1
40,Great views,We love this area but it is a pity about the homeless people who sleep rough. There was not as many this year as in previous years. Great views and walking near to the ocean,LesleyA036

The very well taken care of flowers that are all around are a window dressing all their own.The soft feel of the grass, the shade of the trees, the people walking, exercising, reading, laughing, sharing stories, is all energizing! The dogs going on their walks have smiles on their faces and I can see why.I sipped coconut water through a straw out of a young coconut that the local Whole Foods opening up for me, and paradise showed up - what more could we ask from a day!",ViennaSunflower

Plan your sunset accordingly!",BrianFromMcFarland
50,Spectacular coastline views,"My sweetie and I spend several fun hours, exploring Palisades Park in Santa Monica. There's a sculpture thing is made of wood and has amazing acoustic properties when you step inside. We also enjoyed the rose garden, but wished that the roses had been identified. We walked from San Vicente down to the California Incline and back. We saw joggers, people doing yoga, seniors relaxing on benches and admired the view of the coastline from the bluff. There's even a totem pole that was donated in 1926. I highly recommend this lovely park.",Ambersea

I've spent many, many days in Palisades Park.Still, every time that I visit, I thank Mr. Edward Jones for donating the land to our city in 1892It is an area enjoyed by so many people, with so many incredible vistas. I never tire of the views.This is Santa Monica's most beautiful spot - to walk, run, picnic, sit.Definitely a place to visit.",patches440
40,Lovely stretch of parkland,"Hubby and I loved Palisades Park as it is a real slice of the So-Cal lifestyle. The park is well maintained and very pretty with stunning views over the ocean. I would exercise caution when on your own or at night however as Santa Monica does have a high vagrant population, some of whom are clearly drug or alcohol abusers. Just exercise some common sense and enjoy!",princessboo
50,we walk there almost every day,"This is a classic Southern California experience. The park runs along the bluff which has slowly been chipping off away from the Ocean over the years.

Its a place we enjoy living here.",Chingachgook
40,Great for walking,"My daughter and I frequent this park almost daily. It's a nice break from our daily routine. The greenery and scenic views of the beach and Pacific Ocean are breathtaking. It's nice to have a place to walk away from the traffic. The only concern is that law enforcement needs to continually patrol the park to keep it safe for everyone, because it's a gathering place for those with no home. Hopefully, over time, the issue of homelessness will be dealt with more effectively by social agencies.",Debra S

20,Hard to enjoy when you're a little freaked by the population,"Gotta agree with VMBinexile. Palisades Park is lovely, fantastic setting, everything everyone says it is. But, it is also full of homeless people. This is not an indictment of them individually, but as a solo morning jogger, it makes the park off limits for anyone with common sense. Just don't feel safe in that environment. It probably changes throughout the day, but it's a poor reflection on how the homeless are treated in Santa Monica. It's actually awful.",cathpiano

It is an extraordinary place to stroll, run, sit, picnic, exercise, meditate, etc. Come alone or bring your family and friends. I often just walk it for exercise and mind clearing. The Santa Monica Pier is at one end of it which is great as a starting place or ending place. At the other end is a totem pole and the mouth of Santa Monica Canyon. Even if it's cold the view is fabulous. Also there is a mini rose garden, a pergola and a sculpture built specifically to line up with the sun at solstice.",AFoolForTravel

On a clear day you can see, well, forever; from Palos Verdes and the Channel Islands in the south to Malibu in the north. The palm trees and lush vegetation embody the best California has to offer.

20,great view with a severe homeless problem,"This is a showcase area for Santa Monica. Places like this are a true gem. Great views of the bay, nice landscape, a unique place to visit.However the social reality of what goes on here has been for a long time a major issue.Homeless folks make this their stomping grounds. Clearly this is a intense problem that Santa Monica has been trying to find solutions for years.I do not fault the city for what they are trying to get done here. However as an attraction it makes it very tough to enjoy when you need to be aware of who is sleeping on the ground or panhandling for money.I enjoy coming here but there is a cost to this. People who are expecting a pristine experience should either not come or plan accordlingly. It's safe enough, I never have felt threatened and there are patrols that frequent the park.",Frank G

There are people exercising, walking their dogs, or just reading a book on a blanket all day long. There is usually a City Wifi signal in the park. The view of the beach is perfect, and there are stairs scattered along the park for beach access (if you're in good shape... hey can be steep at the north end!) The landscaping is very well maintained, and the park is very clean (with the exception of the many resident homeless, but in my experience, they are harmless just want a nice place to nap). This park is the perfect place for a scenic daily run with an ocean breeze.The Third Street Promenade and Santa Monica Place mall are just a block or two away, and there is public parking at meters and the many garages, as well as along PCH at the beach and pier. A Visitor Center for Route 66 is located at Santa Monica Blvd, picnic tables at the north and center of the park, and there are restroom facilities at the north end. A beautiful rose garden, some sculptures, and a couple of monuments provide some interest, if you can manage to look away from the beach view!",Ktschmatey
50,Great place to run!,Running in this area was amazing! At 6-6:30 in the morning is perfect as it was around 60 degrees out. There is a path for running and a meandering path all the way through the park. Homeless people everywhere but was not bothered at all. Cross-fit camps all along the park. Enjoyed it thoroughly!,Mishka014

30,Walking the Santa Monica Pier,"We went on July 5, and the crowds were heavy on the beach and boardwalk. We were disappointed with the lack of shops on the boardwalk. There were way too many eateries. The only way to shop was on a couple of kiosk type tshirt vendors. The beach was exciting and clean.",two4golf
30,pretty park with nice vegetation and views,"nice for a stroll in the shade, but the numbers of homeless people make it less relaxing",Heather S
40,Great viewing and run path,"Nice view of the pier, PCH, and beach. The dirt run path is very nice and soft, nice breeze blowing and in the shade.",jbevsjourneys
30,Crowded Park with Nice Views,"There are a lot of homeless people who call Palisades Park home which detracts from its ambiance; but, it is still a neat place. You can see the end of Route 66 here and take a picture next to the sign that marks it, visit the pier (not as pretty as it looks in movies) and the beach which is also crowded. I wouldn't call it a top attraction; but, it is something to do once and pass the time. Try to go at an off peak time to avoid the crowds if possible.",ltlmsmfft
40,Very nice,"Clean and beautiful views, we went biking along to the bike path all the way to Venice beach.",RedLeaf2009
50,Loved walking here,I walked alot in Santa Monica. Enjoyed walking at Palisades Park. Alot of people are running and exercising. Nice.,bilby2009
40,Our visit to Palisades Park..,My kids and her cousins went to go visit this park it was nice park very clean and very relaxing.We did walking for about an hour and the kids are very happy to visit this park.,DOLLY M
50,"fun people space to stroll, rest, play and run","This bluff top park is Santa Monica's gem, also quite close to another, the 3rd street promenade. Great ocean vistas and easy access to the Santa Monica pier.",jmptrips
50,Views from Palos Verdes to Point Dume,"Nice spot to relax on the grass and have a picnic, people-watch or get your daily workout in. From the edge of the bluffs, one can see up and down the entire SM Bay coastline.",DogBeach90265
40,brisk walk or jog along the path in the early am,"i liked the smorgasbord of activity i passed - outdoor yoga, kickboxing etc.",Ed3463
50,Best of L.A scenery,"This is one of the best spots in L.A for running, jogging, yoga, picture taking or simply taking a peaceful stroll while enjoying some of the best views L.A can offer. Areas close to the Santa Monica pier are VERY busy with a surreal amount of tourists taking pictures and checking things out, plus there are some bums here and there. If you go north of Wilshire things quite down, there are way less tourists, more locals. It gets even quieter and more beautiful if you go north of the California incline, between California and Adelaide Streets - simply gorgeous.",Chachacharlie
40,Very charming promenade overlooking the beach & ocean.,"A very nice promenade, with great trees and flowers. Nice overlooking view on the ocean. Perfect for joging. Combine with the Santa Monica Pier and third street shopping avenue.",akhenaton2
50,"Walk along the coast. Great for a day, or a ""picnic in the park"".","Peaceful, special part of the coast that leads into the Santa Monica Mountains, and the ""stairs"" for those who are looking for a work out.",Pricelez
50,My favorite park I've ever been to!,"This park is absolutely amazing, we went there on a walking tour, and who knew it had such a cool history behind it, in addition to being stunningly beautiful? I highly recommend spending an afternoon there.",Sarah A
50,A shady green retreat from the sun.,"The park stretches a good distance along the bluff, providing wonderful views along the way.",San_Diego_Trekker
30,Way too dirty,"This could be an awesome park as it has a magnificant view of the Pacific Ocean and is next to the Pier and a ton of shopping.Why does it get 3 stars you ask? Well it is because Santa Monica is a magnet for homeless people who choose to camp out on the grass and on the benches. Liberal Santa Monica prefers them allow them to enjoy the view rather than people who contribute tax dollars to actually keeping the City running. While I truly feel bad for the people who spend the night here, the majority that I have seen tend to be the more mentally unstable homeless or drug addicted. They need mental health care not to be just left to rot. Sad.",PnSfromLA
40,Great walk,Great to walk along the cliff top and much quieter than the beach or pier. Head up at sunset to catch some picturesque views - leave enough time for traffic if you're driving there.,Letmetravel!
50,One of the Most Beautiful Views in Southern California,Palisades Park runs along the top of the bluff on Ocean Avenue in Santa Monica. It is a park with grass and a walkway looking over the Pacific Ocean and Santa Monica Pier. Wonderful place for a stroll and to catch the sunset.,alanmhersh
40,"Try a 'Walk in the Park!""","This is a little-known (at least to my family) easily reachable spot for taking long walks and pleasant views. We try to get there whenever we have some time to spend in the area, but have not lately returned, as our overseas travels have taken top priority lately.",amercorp
40,"Eclectic, vibrant and always busy.","In the park at all hours there is running, tai chi, cycling, walking, sitting, sleeping, contemplating, dancing, singing, playing, loving, eating, etc. and those of us observing all of the activity. Sit on the fence, sit on a tree or sit on the grass, it is your choice how you enjoy the Park but do stop and enjoy it..",Chewster
50,Great 4 mile run,"From LeMerigot to the end of the park and back is a great 4 mile run on ultra-short, springy grass. The views are magnificent along the way. If you're feeling ambitious, you can also head up San Vicente for a really long run. Love this about Santa Monica. Also, if it's evening, the park is fairly well lit and lots of people are out so (it seems) fairly safe.",NCW14
50,Great Location for a Morning Walk,"Palisades Park is a great place for scenic walks along its lengthy trail. The park stretches about 1.5 miles along a cliff and over looks Pacific Coast Highway (Highway 1). On a clear day, the view of the ocean is unbelievable. Visit the park on an early, winter morning to avoid tourists and crowds. Great location for a picnic. Dogs are welcome and there are lots of them! Street parking available.",VanessaCalifornia
50,"Fabulous, the essence of southern california beach","a long thin green park spaning a couple miles. popular with bikers, joggers and dog walkers. What makes it though, is that its perched right on the cliff overlooking pacific coast highway providing jaw dropping views down to the airport and beyond towards the south, and past malibu looking north. its simply fantastic, free and not to be missed. parking can sometimes be hard to find (meters on the street), but the folks are friendly and you'll feel inspired by your visit. trust me.",pandpCalifornia
50,Temescal Canyon,"Beautiful location in the heart of the city. Participated in a retreat at the Temescal Canyon park. 7 miles from Santa Monica, gorgeous.",MLCSeattle
30,Worth a stroll,"I really was put off by all the street people so obviously living there..lots of litter. The bathrooms were disgusting. I did, however, enjoy the wonderful views, the trees that looked like they were designed by Suess, and the flowers.",ronnifox
30,Hard to review,"This place is, I guess, a 1930s theme park that's dwarfed by Disneyland or 6 Flag Mountain. Young kids will love it. People of my generation can survive the big dipper. It's quaint. It's from a bygone era. The very old carousel is a work of art. The Park is the place to go during daylight hours, not later.",velkytatry
40,a real taste of Santa Monica,"This is a lovely place to walk with great views. On the opposite side of ocean avenue, there are good restaurants as well.",mflickermd
40,Great beachside walk,"The park follows the beach. It is only a thin strip of park, but follows the beach for some kilometers. There are toilet blocks (very well maintained) and water bubblers regularly the whole way along. The walk is paved and flat and the view gorgeous. You will see homeless people along the way - but they don't seem to bother anyone.",Aussie_family794
50,A most beautiful park setting,"When I'm in Santa Monica, I walk this park almost every day. I've walked there at all hours of the day and night and haven't felt unsafe. The park is located on a very long thin strip of land between Ocean Ave and the cliffs overlooking the ocean. The landscaping is impressive and lovingly cared for ... exotic trees and bushes ... a beautiful rose garden ... schulptures and sitting area ... and walking trails make this a perfect place for meditation, jogging or walking, yoga, etc. The view of the ocean and mountains is as good as it gets. It can be a little crowded near the entrance of the Santa Monica Pier, but thins out quickly by the time you are north of Wilshire. There are also several places with steps where you can descend the cliffs to the huge beaches.",Mrblurge
50,Lovely walk,great views and parking at the northern end of the park,vgreene
50,Nice little park - kids love it,"This park is worth a visit if you are in the Palisades. The kids always had fun wandering the lawns, climbing trees, and playing on the jungle gyms. It's not a big park, has a neighborhood feel.",relaxationseeker0
50,great views!,"great views away from the crowds. nice for walking, running, biking skating.... bathroom access.",PatriciaSmom
50,Great exercise area,"Walk, Bike ride,eat lunch or soak in the view.Rent bicycles and ride along the path to venice beach and back for an amazing day!",Swingdancers123
50,Nice Park - Runner's Will Love It!,"Stayed in Santa Monica for a week long trip in August 2011 at the Georgian Hotel. Right across from our hotel was Palisades Park. For sightseeing purposes, walking up and down the park once should do it - not too much to do here, but great views of Santa Monica Pier, Highway 1, and the Pacific Ocean can be had.However, if you are a runner, you will enjoy this park. My partner and I are runners and ran through this park each morning. From that perspective we LOVED the park. The running trails are not that long in distance (I think it goes 1.6 miles one way), but we would just turn around and run it again and again. Running along Ocean Avenue and atop the bluffs was just such a fun experience. While running you can take in ocean views, breezes, and most likely see celebrities exercising in the same area (we saw Reese Witherspoon and Arnold Schwarzenegger).I recommend a stop by this park for any visitor, but especially for runners. My only advice is to wear shoes you do not mind getting dirty as the dirt trails do stain your tennis shoes. Other than that just enjoy the sights and sounds the park has to offer!",JTF_1977
