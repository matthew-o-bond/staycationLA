50,"Astoundingly beautiful, serene gardens",I visited Los Angeles for a week and saw all kinds of things but the Lake Shrine Temple was my favorite by far! The gardens are strikingly beautiful. I went in the late morning and there was still a bit of mist on the water. It was so inspiring! This would be a great place to go if you enjoy quiet reflection and the beauty of nature. It seems mostly accessible for handicapped or elderly people. Bring your camera with you!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SMLove226

50,Peaceful getaway,"If you ever get tired of fast-paced city life, Lake Shrine is just a short drive away from Los Angeles. It provides an amazing sanctuary for peace seekers. The view is amazing, with a beautiful lake in the middle, gardens around it, a few religious buildings and statues, and benches to sit in. I see a lot of people meditating, writing, and simply relaxing.It's a quiet place, so don't talk loudly while you're there!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Athenalim
50,Tranquility sanctuary,You need to add Lake Shrine in your bucket list while visiting Los Angeles. I loved to walk arround the lake and enjoyed the peacefully air here. This is a peaceful escape during your hectic days. Being alone here may release all the tension in your mind.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peony_89
50,Gorgeous and eye opening,"I had this on my list for the longest time to just stop in and see what the gardens were like. I really loved walking the beautiful grounds around sunset, watching men and women sit or stand and reflect quietly in their own unique ways, seeing the swan and ducks swimming peacefully. It's a quiet place for an afternoon of introspective thoughts, meditation or reading. The kind, elderly lady at the visitor center is so helpful and willing to answer any questions you might about about the shrine, the yogananda, the message, or anything else you can think of. She responds so graciously and is patiently, so if you have questions I recommend paying her a visit. I peaked in the temple, but didn't go in. I did see others silently meditating. The photos above the alter were a little distracting to me, but that is just my own personal taste.I would say, even for an afternoon walk with a friend, this place is a wonderful place for reflection and refilling.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ElizabethK941
30,Interesting.,"Beautiful grounds, wonderful history. Just wondering why I saw no Hindhu people of any type around. The service I attended was performed by a guy from Montana who couched his 'message around Jesus, using yoga principles. This was a bit confusing, as I thought this place was meant to honor world peace and ALL religions. Well, I bought the book' Autobiography of a Yogi' after the service and left. i will go back only for meditation and reflection, but probably won't attend services. I am trying to get away from the influence of a 'world domination theme' that certain groups have trued to force feed the world. I felt it at that service, albeit subtly. That part of this temple disgusted me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zenith1000
50,Beautiful.,"Easy to access, the Shrine Temple and lake are wonderful. A peaceful escape hidden in plain sight. Stay an hour, stay the day.Tour of the Shrine Temple on Sunday at 3pm was very nice.

The gardens on the lake level below the temple are world famous.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gerricorbin
50,Wonderful and peaceful,"I spend the afternoon there and it is a wonderful, beautiful and peaceful place to go and meditate. It is linked to the self realization fellowship but it is open to visit. They have a book shop with Yogananda work, cds and another shop with some sacred gifts. The place is a garden with lake, trees, places to sit down and meditate. It is worthwhile to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnayaKunst
50,Shhhhh!,"I have 2 reasons for the whimsical title of my review. 1/ It is an incredibly serene locale and 2/ for fear of attracting crowds, I hesitate to publicize one of my favorite places to take out of town visitors.It is almost surreal as one enters this oasis of calm surrounded by a major urban area. It does not take long to make the trek around the lake which has its share of swans and large turtles. The ""thing"" to do is just take a few moments to reflect in one of the innumerable little alcoves around the lake. It is a place of beauty and the selection of flowers and plants is astounding. What I like is that nobody bothers you as you walk peacefully around the lake (there is a discreet religious undertone, but absolutely nobody ever approaches you with propaganda, so just enjoy the beauty). There is a windmill with a medication room, but it was closed for renovation on this particular trip in early October 2013. In the past, I have always stopped in for a few moments of reflection.Although the locale is owned by the Self Realization Fellowship and some of the statues and signage attest to that, there is also an inter-denominational feel. I even spotted a statue of the Virgin Mary this time, and on previous trips I especially liked an area devoted to the world's great religions - all understated, but with flowers symbolizing various tenets of those religions.So take an hour or two to get off the beaten path and enjoy some rare serenity in Los Angeles. It's totally free to enter and to park. And the picture-taking alone is worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FrequentTraveller034
50,Overlooked! Hidden gem in Sunset -L.A,"Whether you are a local or a tourist, make sure you visit this Temple and Retreat. It is Free and seldom does it get crowded. Make sure you don't get there very late as it closes early. Just walk around and enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dominika34
50,Serene place right off Sunset and PCH,"This is as good as it can get on trip advisor, reviews from a local. Take it from me, when I lived in the valley I would come here as part of my day on the westside, yoga at Bryan Kest Power Yoga, smoothie at Jamba Juice and a take a short drive to this stunning and serene garden,It is the perfect place to get away from the hustle and bustle of fourth street. I would have never expected something like this close to the touristy Santa Monica area.Free entrance, meditation class on Thursday and services Sunday mornings. Parking can be limited, if you can figure out the bus route to here, I would definitely consider a bus pass.A great addition to a day going to the Getty Villa if someone was headed out that way. This place closes most days at 4:30pm.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LadyLiza
50,Peaceful and breathtakingly beautiful,"I was brought here by a friend who is very engaged in the principles that are espoused by Yogananda. I essentially came along for the ride to see some beautiful gardens. I surely was not disappointed; the plantings and landscaping are lush, perfectly maintained, and have a magical design and balance. But that was just a tiny part of the reward of joining him; I felt a tremendous sense of equilibrium while strolling around the lake and through its landscaped paths. I was able to imagine why a movement like this had engendered such a powerful and devoted following.And don't worry: if you go only for the gardens, that's ok too. Just go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrewstaBoy
50,Amazingly tranquil garden,"Wow, how did not we visit it sooner! Stunning beauty just off sunset blvd. in Pacifi Palisade. Make sure to take many photos!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/142SusanR
50,Best quiet spot in LA,I am so thankful to the person who introduced me to this place. You will never believe what an incredibly contemplative place it is. There are words of widsom from various religious traditions all around. I didn't even want to disrupt the quiet with pictures. This is a must-visit location if you appreciate finding quiet in busy cities.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tamikacaston
50,"Meditate,reflect & relax.","The Lake Shrine has always been a personal favorite place for me.It's really a meditative,relaxing place to be still or walk quietly and reflect on life.Or nothing.Or ducks.There are beautiful gardens,a serene lake and little chapel-all great for meditation.It's so peaceful here-I have come here with friends but once you get here you just want to relax.It's not a place for chatting or cell phones- I have not experienced that here.They do have classes and events for self realization/meditation.I love it here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WeRTrippin
50,Peaceful respite ... food for your soul,"We are local to Los Angeles (Orange County) and make it a point to drive up and visit the Self Realization Fellowship Lake Shrine, at least quarterly. It's a lovely, lovely hour or two of reverence and reflection and genuine serenity. We'll generally drive up PCH... you turn right onto Sunset just across from Gladstones. It's just blocks up Sunset, easy to miss. Parking and admission are free. There are clean restrooms near the beginning. We walk all the way around the Lake, which is a nice gentle walk of less than an hour (looks way more demanding than it is -- don't hesitate if you are not athletic). There are statues, beautiful flower plantings and various chapels and shrines and benches along the way. Lots to look at-- swans, turtles, koi, flowers... or you can just sit and look at nothing and fill your heart. It's beautiful, soulful and more than a bit romantic. No food, no real shopping, no amusements, no crowds when you go late day (closes 4pm). Pictures are always gorgeous, and sometimes we leave there and go catch sunset in Venice or cocktails at Gladstones. Really a treasure---let's don't tell too many people!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lauranlauren
50,Beautiful Hidden Gem,My husband and I stopped by here after visiting the Getty Villa and I have to say it is breathtaking. A beautiful oasis the lake and gardens are very well kept up the turtles are beautiful the little boat and Dutch windmill picturesque. It is the perfect place for anyone of any religion to come and reflect on the greatness of God or just to meditate or do yoga. We went on a Sunday and the parking lot is very small but we were lucky to get a space. I suggest going early because of this it's so beautiful here and peaceful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Darin_and_Christi
50,Calming and Peaceful,"Its unusual to find such a peaceful place to contemplate, especially near a busy city and freeway in LA. Don't forget your camera because here you will find lovely gardens to view, benches to sit on, sea life (turtles and fish) to enjoy and water features to soften the surrounding sounds. A perfect spot to meditate if you are so moved. One could spend as little as 10 minutes or as long as a few hours here. If you bring children, please remind them of what the garden is intended for. When we were there, there were children running around and yelling to each other and that took away from our experience.There is a chapel, small library and store on site. It is easy to find with a GPS, free to enter and park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jean705
50,Solitude and Reflection,"If you're looking for a touch of quiet during a bustling vacation, or just a break from the grind of the everyday, you can't go wrong with the Lake Shrine Temple. With the space dedicated for peace and relaxation, you are sure to find the solitude for which you are seeking. Beautiful flowers, outstanding water features, a myriad of birds and other wildlife, and the only place outside of India that holds a portion of Mahatma Ghandi's ashes, it is a place you will put on your ""Must See"" list. And, if you have read ""Autobiography of a Yogi"", or are interested in meditation, be sure to catch their Temple Tour. You learn more about Parahamasa Yogananda, as well as have an opportunity to experience a guided meditation inside their temple doors.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rokclmr
40,A bit of peace.,This is a lovely peaceful idyllic garden setting where some of the remains of Mahatma Ghandi are laid to red.I particularly enjoyed looking at the giant Koi Carp and Turtles swimming in the lake. Perched on the lake is a freshly painted house boat which is sometimes used by visiting shawmi.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KazBiss
50,Heaven on Earth,"This sanctuary in Los Angeles is one of the most peaceful places in all of Southern California. Go with reverence and an intention to enjoy the wonderful vibrations and peace. If you are a meditator, it's the place for you. Spend some time in the Windmill Chapel or just on one of the many meditaton benches scattered throughout the property set amidst glorious gardens. Also spend some time behind the Golden Lotus Archway at the Gandhi World Peace Memorial where part of the Mahatma's ashes are enshrined. The Lake Shrine was opened in 1950 by Self Realization Fellowship and dedicated to peace and understanding among all religions. The great spiritual master, Paramahansa Yogananda walked these grounds and slept in the lovely houseboat that is still there. His vibrations can still be felt by all those who are receptive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mosinay
50,A BEAUTIFUL SANCTUARY,"I visited the ""Lake Shrine"" on 6/20/2012 (I've been there before). It is a beautiful sanctuary from the cares of living in a big city like Los Angeles. Run by the Self-Realization Fellowship it has been open to the public since 1950. ""Lake Shrine"" is a natural amphitheater with a spring fed lake. It is a great joy to take a peaceful walk around the lake (the total site is 10 acres). Around the lake are some unusual sites including the Windmill Chapel (a reproduction of a 16th century Dutch windmill), a Houseboat (which was used by Paramahansa Yogananda when he personally supervised the construction of the ""Lake Shrine""), and the Gandhi World Peace Memorial (which includes a brass coffer containing a portion of Mahatma Gandhi's ashes). It is the beauty of the well maintained grounds that is ""Lake Shrine's"" main appeal, however. Flowers, plants, and grasses surround the lake giving a person a feeling of peace and serenity not found elsewhere. The day I went many turtles could be seen in the lake as well as numerous colorful fish. There is no entry charge but donations are appreciated.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DwainC
40,Beautiful and Peaceful,Great place to visit if you are in or around Malibu. It is the only other place in the world where Mahatma Gandhi's ashes have been preserved.
