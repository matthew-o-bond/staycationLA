50,Great Small Con,"I've only ever been to big conventions, but this was a breath of fresh air. While no major cosplayers were there, lots of industry guests still made appearances and all the games were free! The market was great and I still got to see a lot of amazing cosplayers. If you want a first con or a small con to relax at, this is the one for you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iwenttoacon
20,Animangausa 2019,Animangausa was a fairly good con well worth the money and good price range. would totally recommend to expand the con more. Probably bring more food vendors aince there wasn't a variety and more con security since it is easy to sneak in without a badge.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kiyokor373
50,It was so much fun,My niece and I had a really good time. We got to walk around and check out all the different vendors. The whole event was family friendly,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/randyt732019
50,Great event,Was really fun! Got to meet and get signatures of some cool people and lots of good vendors. Will probably be going again next year.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Flyer10823825512
50,the beginning of a journey,"I really liked going to animanga because it was such a fun experience. It got me to meet new people like the artists and cosplayers. I was able to get more art books so I can do more with my art. I was able to meet with some of the artists and get to know them a little bit more and ask them questions. They told me about their own art styles and what they are comfortable with drawing, some of the software they use, and even told me that I could do my own art booth and they told me where I can go print my art. I liked playing video games that other people were playing, I was a little bit sad when i was not able to join the super smash bros tournament but, at least I got to play with two other people",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brave1381
30,It has potential,"Fun weekend in a smaller convention. I can see this becoming bigger in the future. The panels were solid, the game selections was good and the vendors were great. To improve would mean to get bigger, the space was small which was beneficial but also a detriment. Wish it was two sections/buildings one for panels and the other for the artist alley/vendors hall and itasha display. I believe in this con, be better than the others. Do it right and dont lose your way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Charmingsenpai
40,Pretty good local convention,"For a small local convention, it's pretty fun and lots of cosplayers show up. Decent selection of vendors and activities to do. There are quite a lot of food and beverage options (including alcohol) sold at the venue but it's pricey as you would expect. Parking gets a bit crowded throughout the day so I'd recommend showing up earlier if you can.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/animedreamer
50,Right at home,"I took my son who is into anime, everybody was very friendly and polite. You see he suffers from Autism and yet everybody made him feel right at home. Thank you all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/miguel67672019
50,First Con and Loved it,Animanga was my first con i ever went to. Its really good and i will go again. I met so many people there and it was a lot of fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vaderosella
50,Amazing! Animanga 2019,"For me, I actually attended Animanga 2019 as an Artist Alley vendor, not as an attendee. But even still, it was an amazing experience all around! They were very helpful with vendors from badge pickup all the way to cleanup and tear-down on the last day!!! I did get to walk around the convention hall as an ""attendee"" while I was taking a break from selling at my Artist Alley table, and it was just amazing to see all of the available booths and activities there were! And my favourite part was the variety of vendors and Artists Alley artists that were accepted and able to show!!! My one thing that I had a little bit of trouble with was with parking, but that is a reflection of the Pomona Fairgrounds itself, not the Animanga event. Overall really great, and I already have my table booked for next year 2020 in Artist Alley! SO looking forward to it and I can't wait!!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lizwidner
40,it was very fun even for a 42 year old,"I absolutely loved the Japanese arcade section. I am an avid gamer and collector of Japanese video home consoles and arcade boards, and even I had not played or seen a few of the arcades at the show. Another thing I liked was the Japanese performers singing Japanese anime songs. I hope that you could invite more singers next year. I will definitely come check you guys out next year",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rchk519
30,Not as good as I hoped,"I would say that Animanga was okay, but it's not as good as I hoped. There weren't any nearby hotels as far as I know, and I couldn't find the place to sit after the convention was over. At least i purchased alot of cool stuff and met two of my favorite voice actresses.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DawnHibiki
50,Pleasantly surprised,"I was a little skeptical coming to this con since it was smaller and my luck with small cons in the past hasn't been the best. When I arrived I was pleasantly surprised with the amount of vendors/cosplayers/fun things to do there, so glad I decided to go! ^-^",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ari-chan90
50,Animanga 2019,"This was my first anime convention, and I had a blast. There was so much to do and see, and had a few celebrities that I was really happy to see and meet. The art section was probably my favorite section, because there were so many incredibly talented artists who could show off their work and sell it. I would definitely go again, and in fact am planning currently.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amclean912
50,"Come for cosplay, stay for games",A fun small anime convention that has tons of stuff for the whole family. The arcade itself is worth every penny spent.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MissMsRis
50,Animanga,"Took my son cause he's a huge fan and we always have a great time. Was so excited they had anime designed cars on display this year, it was a great addition.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/juhlinen
50,Best “small” con I’ve ever been too,The perfect amount of content to appreciate for the size and price of the con. I can’t wait to come back next year and participate in the cosplay contest as well!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dmarl94
50,"Great venue, Great staff, Great show","Ticket price is spot on for what you get to experience at this show, Great vendors, easy parking, Wish parking was a little cheaper, Adult beverages are available as well, I have been every year for the past 4 years, Never disapoints.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrKixkback
40,Lots of fun and promise as event grows,"This event is relatively new and smaller compared to the other conventions in Southern California, but that make is better in some respects because you don't have to deal with the crowds and lines like the other events. You still get some of the same great experiences as the other ones: awesome cosplay, celebrities, cool vendors, and lots of great stuff to see and participate in. Great value for the price!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sdcyclist
40,Anime convention visit,I liked that all those video games was free to play. And had no issues with parking. Will recommend this convention to others.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mizu88ka
50,My Review,It was really fun. It was very fun and the fact that it costed only 15 dollars is amazing. I wish I can go again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kboomer2019
50,Wonderful!!,"Animanga 2019 was my first convention, and I hope to go back in 2020! The service was great and I had a blast!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ghostbees
50,Animanga 2019,"Animanga 2019 was my first anime convention and I couldn’t have been happier with my experience. It’s small enough to make newcomers feel welcome but big enough to let more experienced con goers enjoy themselves. The vendors, artist alley, and the large gaming area were all amazing and the stage performances were also fun to sit down and watch when I needed a break from walking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pegasus0147
40,Great Fun,"Honestly, it's a fun event to attend to, everyone's friendly, games all around, sweet music and merchandise, and probably one of the best parts is meets and greets with artist.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oscarsos156
30,Family play time,Overall nice people great stuff to browse buy and hang just needs better handling on space and seating,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mez583258
40,2nd Time Tabling at a Con,"My girlfriend and I shared our second experience tabling just last August at Animanga. We had a lot of fun and the hall itself offered a generous amount of space, so we had plenty of room to get up and stretch our legs throughout the weekend! Even though it's a fairly new and small event, there were a few rows of arcade machines and plenty of guest speakers and attractions to get a day's worth of entertainment. The amenities here were nice as well, the venue was super clean, and they provided free power strips for the artists! Huge plus when it comes to staying charged. :) I would love to come table again next year if I can make it out there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LilBirdyDraws
50,Great Event!,"A relatively small convention, great for fans of all ages. Definitely loved the free arcade section!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alegriagarcia
20,"Very slow. Unoccupied tables, low sales","Vending at the event, it was the slowest of the year. There were unoccupied tables neighboring mine, detracting from the traffic flow in the area. The placement of the artist alley was not strategically placed for foot traffic. It was too far behind the larger booths and behind a free arcade area where people stopped without going any further. Overall, it was a poor selling experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TealTeacupShop
50,super fun,"While it’s not as big as anime expo, it has a lot of room to move through the aisles (no squeezing between huge crowds) and it was a lot more fun",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jessicadoell
50,Very fun going next year again,"It was really fun. Also it was my first expo, so this event set the bar quite high. There was tons of cool things on sale and many attractions. There was also a good assortment of food vendors that came by so you wouldn't have to go very far to get food. Overall, it was a very good experience and I plan on going again next year!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RickyV777
50,Great Con for 1st Timers!,"Perfect size for families and 1st timers. Not too big, not too small. Great vendors and Artist. Highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/juanitam893
30,"Fun con, not a lot going on","I only went for one day for a few hours, and that was enough to see everything. There weren't a lot of panels and performances, which is something I like to see at cons. I also hate the fairplex for these events just because it makes parking atrocious. However, the free arcade is the best thing ever.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Angelofhyrule
50,"Animanga is a fantastic anime, gaming, and cosplay convention!",Very fun weekend. Be sure to bring the family and friends. Lots of food and stuff to do. Cosplay competition and gaming events makes it a full weekend.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dengony
