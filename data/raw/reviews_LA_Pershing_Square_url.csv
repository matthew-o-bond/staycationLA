40,Nice spot in the midst of bustling downtown LA,"Sat in the park and caught up with an old friend. It was a beautiful sunny day! Lots of tables, chairs and benches and colorful characters for people watching. If you don't mine the colorful characters, it is a perfectly lovely spot to bring your coffee, laptop, lunch, and chillax.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/drea614
30,Average,Pershing Square was nothing special. When we visited there were some renovations in progress so some of the square was shut off. The food stands and unique item stalls were nice and the area itself was quite pleasant and clean.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MR_Travels1920
30,Centrally Located next to Metro,This square is on the small side but is located right in the heart of Historic LA and right next to the metro station. The square honors general Pershing who led US troops in WWI. There is a statue of the general in the square but otherwise the square is not that impressive. I can imagine that many events are held here so it is functional for the locals but not so exciting for tourists. Perhaps the nicest part of the square is the view of all the tall buildings that surround it.If you like this review please give it a ‚Äúhelpful‚Äù click.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jbushman2017
40,Neat garden,"Pershing Square in Downtown LA is a neat garden, is surround by amazing architecture and holds is own as part of the scenery, relax have a coffee and enjoy the green.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TeamWard
40,Pleasant in the green spaces,"Much of the area is pavement but there are agreeable spaces of greenery and other flora. It is a major landmark in Downtown.Opposite the majestic Millennium Biltmore Hotel, there is also an eponymous metro train station adjacent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/permia
40,Ice skating,"Concerts on weekends in Spring and Summer, I've skating rink being installed now and will open soon. I've rink you can rent time on ice and skates. Great skating at end of day and wonderful place to brush up on your skills. Enjoyable experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thomaspV9787QW
10,Dangerous at night,"The square is sparse mainly unclean concrete and frequented by homeless, mentally ill people and is a waste of time in daylight and your mad if you go there at night even though there is a heavy police presence.Oh and good luck stepping round human excrement.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Auscoach
50,Visiting Pershing Square then you must visit the iconic Art Deco Biltmore Hotel.,"If you‚Äôre in Los Angeles and visiting Pershing Square or near by then visiting the Biltmore Hotel should be an absolute must. With the public welcome, visit this wonderful example of an Art Deco interior. Enjoy a reasonably priced coffee or lunch coffee in sumptuous surroundings. Visit their historical corridor full of photos the old film stars who have visited the Biltmore themselves. Free internet too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaddoDB
30,Nice ice baby,"Visiting in December and in the middle of the square is an ice rink, hire up those skates and get your rink on! At night the lights pick out the trees, very nice",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chuckofcorby
40,The go-to place for political rallies and demonstrations,"As well as a variety of concerts. Very much cleaned up than from years before. The Biltmore is right north and the area is now surrounded by cafes, apartment buildings and offices, many with modern art and art folklorico themes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rebwriter
40,Food and Modern Architecture,"My boyfriend and I were staying at a hotel in the nearby vicinity and decided to check Pershing Square out. There‚Äôs not a crazy amount of things to do in the square or a lot of greenery, but I think it‚Äôs worth a quick look if you‚Äôre in the area due to the modern architecture, like the 10-story bell tower or random spheres all over the place.Also, on Wednesdays there‚Äôs a farmers market which I think is worth going to if in the area. When we were standing in line at a popular pupusa stand to get some fruit drinks (highly recommend the raspberry lemonade), we were offered some free cheese samples by a really nice vendor nearby. We also got a pork tamale which was really good as well. There were plenty of places to sit, and the square was just a pleasant area where you could sit, relax, and eat on a sunny day. You also have some good views of nearby buildings in downtown LA. Recommend going on a sunny Wednesday.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DND2020
50,Parking,That's the best parking in downtown. Price maximum-16$ from 4 pm until 11 am next day. Strictly recommended in this area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DimS335
20,Disappointing,"Not a lot here to see, not my idea of a public space. A few statues, a bit of greenery and some benches in the shade inhabited by some undesirable characters I‚Äôm afraid. Near to a metro stop and close the the Central library which is worth a visit.Maybe when the concerts are on here, it transforms but not by day.Give it a miss in my opinion.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnnieM452
30,An open space next to a metro station,"I would only seek out this destination if there were an event going on and would definitely not consider it a must see. The park is close to some very interesting buildings---The Biltmore (iconic LA hotel) and the Title Guarantee and Trust Building (art deco) are right on the square. The Los Angeles Athletic Club, the Oviatt Building (art deco) and the NoMad Hotel (the old Bank of Italy building) are a few blocks away. The majority of the park is concrete, which in itself is an interesting concept downtown in a city filled with concrete. There is a small sliver strip of green where there are a few statues (Beethoven, Dough Boy from World War I and a 7th Cavalry Soldier from the Spanish American War) and a cannon, but a good portion of the park looks just like what it has become---the top of a parking garage.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adalbert3
50,In the heart of downtown LA!,"We really enjoy this park mostly due to its location, which is in the center of the downtown area. After a day of wandering and sight seeing, we many times end up here on a bench with a sandwich and a drink. There is a metro stop right across the street, and there is a large underground parking ramp which is also very beneficial. Also in the area are plenty of restaurants and things to do. There is a rather large homeless population hanging out here but we have never been bothered by anyone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rduinc
50,Perfect photo spot,"It's a art spot with great spots to take nice photos. It's nice to read, walk or just relax. Near a Metro station it's perfect for a break.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JorgeFilipeRibeiro
50,SUT WALK 2017 BY: AMBER ROSE,Attended to show support with amber rose's sut walk 2017. Had an amazing time park was big in size and able to accommodate all the guest.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PassportPornStar
30,Downtown LA's main square in real need of a makeover,"Pershing Square is downtown L.A.'s largest public space. Sadly, it lacks much greenery and is dotted with large concrete pillars and towers. There's really not much to see or do (there is an outdoor skating rink in winter) and it attracts many homeless and mentally challenged individuals. It is in desperate need of a makeover to make it a truly comfortable public space.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T4232XIjohnb
10,Town #quare of Los Angeles,Town square of Los Angeles. Not much of a gathering place. The design turns people away rather than embracing them. Needs to be demolished and rebuilt to attract people. Perhaps an old fashion band stand is needed.Only redeeming features might be the subway stop and large underground parking lot.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cavydad
20,Lots of concrete.....,"This was my least favorite public area in LA (not that I hit them all). Compared to other public spaces, this was definitely underutilized, even by the homeless, because there is not enough shaded area.I did like the main sculpture that towers over the Square and changes by the minute as the shadows move across it surface.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/differentname
20,Smells bad,ƒ∞t has nothing special and it smells so badüò∑ there are lots of homeless around too‚ùó please do not go with hope,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NorthStar729708
20,A little run down,"This park was originally built in 1923 to highlight the Biltmore Hotel. Obviously, the playground and modern features have been added, but over the more recent years, it's been a little neglected and has fallen prey to the homeless. There was a security guard on site, but no one really took note of me.I was staying nearby and checking out the area, and I enjoyed taking a stroll through the square at dusk and snapping some dramatic photos with the skyscrapers and smog-induced sunset in the background.There is a wall of paintings of celebrity artists, and a plaza of tables and chairs under umbrellas. I also like statues and there were a few tucked away in the corner by the pet area.The plaza is painted in bright, fun colors, and features a modern playground that has that spongy rubber floor that's all the playground rave. There weren't any kids there that day, but it was 100¬∞, so I'm pretty sure the thought of scalding their skin on a metal playground was a strong deterrent. There were bulletins for summer events and some concerts hosted in the park, but nothing happening the day I was there. (100¬∞, People) I hear they have an ice rink in the winter. If they have it this year, I'll probably come back for that.The park in-and-of-itself is mostly concrete, and isn't overwhelming, or even whelming, but it is in the center of downtown and surrounded by the fashion and jewelry districts, metro bus stops, restaurants, and downtown sights.In other words, you shouldn't go out of your way just to see this park, but a quick pass through while walking to other downtown sights might be worth your while.Hope that helps! Enjoy DTLA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/311queenj
30,Not what it used to be,Pershing Square is an interesting place to visit and watch all of the folks both employed and otherwise. It used to have lots of grass but now it is mostly concrete with a few plantings but it occupies a special place in front of the Biltmore Hotel and is worth the visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/buffalojim67
30,Nothing special about it,Pershing Square has nothing special. It has an average park and the only useful thing is that it has a metro station.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AntoNic7
30,Normal Park,Pershing square is just a nice park that is in the middle of downtown and situated next to a couple places such as Grand Central Market or other restaurants. It is pretty average.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlexBTraveler
20,Nothing To See,Small park area in the middle of downtown but mainly occupied by the homeless when we walked through. I wouldn't go out of my way to see the place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/newspapertaxi
10,Yuck,Nothing to see here but homeless people and ugly concrete. It's not really even an attraction. Felt unsafe and held my bag closer to me until I cleared this spot.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CountessChloe
40,Great photo opt!,Nice park area with a fantastic background photo opt. All of the dirtbags and homeless people certainly do bring the place down. It is in a busy location with the Grand Central Marketplace near by for all of it's wonderful food and beverage options.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ahems
30,Only worth visiting if you are in the area,"I went to Pershing square because it was near my hotel, the place had some homeless people walking around and a few people I am would not like to meet on a dark street.I did luck out and see that one day the park had a farmers market sale with a bunch of booths selling different types of food.Outside of seeing the farmers market I did not see any reason to visit the place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NNWSLARRY
10,Don't bother,Not sure why this gets good reviews. It's an alright looking urban square surrounded by multiple people asking for money and with a slightly unsafe vibe. All the security on the doors of surrounding businesses are there for a reason - I've never seen security in a Starbucks before. Don't bother.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Andyuk100
10,Monument to Dead Trees,"One of the most ugly and pitiful urban squares I have ever seen. Most of the trees and plants are dead or dying, Lots of concrete and ugly painted concrete structures. Just a huge dead space surrounded by generally ugly architecture. No one wants to linger,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TV2451
40,Not as Google describes but still a cultural insight,"Google calls this an artsy park with summer activities. Yes there are some aging art pieces and someone flew a wind based piece over part of the park, but the real attraction here is the way the park fits a vital role in the City of LA's life. The Metro is just across the street and Union Station is an easy 6 block walk. The surrounding jewelry district has never really attracted me, but I hear there are lots of middlemen's mark ups to be avoided if you buy your rocks there. No, the park has become a hub for gathering of the simmering discontent of Los Angeles and broader metro area. There are regularly large events scheduled in the park ranging from the downtrodden (LA Rescue Mission is just 5 blocks east), those opposed to the NSA surveillance, to the left's Occupy types, to women upset at loss of reproductive rights, etc. Now lots of these are only knowable by scouring social media, but you can do it. Afterwards, the park returns to the silently discontented homeless population who are subjected to LAPD over enforcement, but that's another comment. There is an underground parking structure, but I don't recommend it. I couldn't get my car out for 30 minutes because the limited exits were blocked by throngs of protesters.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RichardfromHB
30,Nice park in the heart of the city,"Pershing Square has a lot of history and is an attraction in the heart of the city. According to the website, there are different programs going on at the site throughout the year. Through the eyes of a traveler, it is another attraction site with not much do do and to see. A good place to sit for drinks and enjoy seeing people in the ice skating rink.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PrawetJ
40,nice,heart of the city. But I don't understand why - in LA there are no people! In NY in the same place there are crowds. But here on the ice there were only 3 people...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/piotrh1982
30,Farmers market,I would've loved to have given this a higher rating but one half of the park was a farmers market while the other half was closed. I would've liked to have walked around more without seeing the place filled with a lot of homeless people. It sadly becomes a sore eye.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WickedCakes
30,City square,Located in the heart of city surrounded by high rise building. It's a nice area to in the downtown but nearby can find homeless people too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joanadventure
50,Colorful City square,"This colorful city square located in the jewelry district, high rise buildings surround it. sometimes there are lunch time activities, summer music play, winter ice skating. Screen the busy street traffic, but I think in it people should see the busy street to enjoy people watching.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RChangla
40,Inviting space in the heart of downtown LA,"I originally intended to see the Liquid Shard exhibition in the square, but it was over by the time I visited. Still, I decided to go and check out the square before taking class at Bar Method a couple of blocks away, and I am glad I did. The space is bright and colorful--a nice break from the stern facades and dirty sidewalks all around--and offers musical entertainment at certain times of the week. There are statues and beautiful greenery, a pet area, and plenty of open space to stare at the skyline. Definitely a place to stop and relax.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/129sylvies
40,Neat Area Of Los Angeles!,"Nice area to listen to music, have a picnic on the lawn, eat dinner from a food truck. So much going on at this one spot in the city that changes often... nice to have in downtown LA among buildings, shops and restaurants.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/katork
30,Tendency to Ruin Central Squares,"First of all a disclaimer: I was here in July 2015, and what I'll write about is highly dynamic, so it might be completely different each time of year. However, the review might still be relevant for tourists.Pershing square is probably the most famous public square in LA. It appears in a lot of popular culture and media, and I remember it from Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3, GTA V, among others. I was therefore really excited to come here. However, to my disappointment, the powers that be did to this square what many municipalities often do: turned into some kind of market/fair, covering much of the area of the square with stalls, installations and whatnot.It was therefore not really possible to see all the geometries and the colors here, let alone enjoy the place to its fullest. I guess the city wanted to make some money, but for me and probably other tourists, this ruined the experience. On the plus side, the square is close to many other interesting places in Downtown LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ynhockey
50,A gem of artesian craft!,While walking around we stumbled upon this location. We were absolutely amazed at the hand made crafts from Morocco. The artist themselves were selling the items and very friendly. If you want a truly unique piece of work you must go here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Golgo8
20,A Park of the '90's.,"The strangely decorated park features an odd fountain and structure inside that feels a bit pulled from a 1990's film. It is largely composed of cement and lined with palm trees. While there is talks of an update to this poorly dated place, it has yet to happen. Perhaps visit in the winter months when there is an ice rink that will charge you an arm and a leg, yet won't cover them when you break one.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thomguzow
50,Beautiful,"Visited this place because its part of Hilary Duff's movie, A Cinderella Story movie background. It's like childhood all over again. Very nice place to chill!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leowaniel
50,Great Ice Rink - during the holidays,We have visited the Pershing square a few years ago and this year again for gun in the ice rink. This place is really nice and has a relaxed feeling - even when there is a crowd. We tried one hour in the ice $13 each person (skates included). $9 without skates. They have cute penguins and polar beats for little kids to be able to skate on their own. Today we skated with about 50 people and is was ok. Their parking lot is $14 on weekdays and $7 on weekends.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lxjuarez
40,Green Space @ Jewelry District ...,"Pershing Square is a welcome green space block in the midst of the concrete jungle and tall buildings of downtown. Lots of parking underneath and maintained safely, since the Diamond / Jewelry District starts just next door. Lots of homeless & panhandlers but just ignore them. Is a safe area since almost every jewelry store has an armed guard! ...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dblmed
30,Open Space in a Canyon of Concrete and Glass,"Farmers market stalls and prepared food stalls line the perimeter of this large concrete space in the middle of downtown. A children's playground with soft flooring is available, too. Can't say it's worth a special trip, but if you are around, stopping by is easy and interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PlatinumHoney

40,Nothing Special Unless There Is An Event,In the middle of the city and a nice place to check out homeless people. The only time this place is not so bad is when they hold events here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NickMcNally
40,Endearing neighborhood,"Something that many people don't know about Pershing Square. It's across the street from the LA Diamond District. Most of the tall buildings have many jewelry stores, commercial and retail. My husband bought my engagement diamond ring there in 1953. Then years later my son also bought his sweetie's engagement ring there. Note: both marriages are still going strong!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/swancastle
30,It's ok nothing special,"If you're in the area I would walk around it, but I wouldn't go out of my way to visit here. It also looks good if your room at the Biltmore is facing down on it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nikost550
30,Not a peaceful oasis,"No peace here because of the homeless people. Should be an oasis in the middle of the financial district. I actually got accosted by one homeless person who was very persistent, I struggled to shake him off. Still, it was potentially a nice spot, save for what I already mentioned.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Albywon
20,Ok sitting area,We were here for an appointment steps from this park so we came to sit here but I would definitely not make a special trip to come see this. On our Monday morning we did see a lot of homeless.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sndunga
20,Hole in the ground,"For a district that has hotels and banks and other great (if a little run down) buildings, this square is a bit of a void. I guess it's functional, there is a metro and you can park there, but I don't know why it's not something better",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Openfj0re
10,Homeless,"OMG This City is full of homeless people in every metro station, park, sidewalj. Si horrible and the sidewalks stink to piss. Horrible",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/617ericks

40,A Place for Outdoor Ice-Skating,"Pershing Square is a nice place for outdoor ice-skating in Los Angeles downtown, CA. Visitor can take either Red or Purple subway train to get there. But it is a little smaller in comparing with the Citi Pond in New York City, New York or the PPG Place ice-skating rink in Pittsburgh, PA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kitty64HKG

40,Great neighborhood,Great place to walk around and eat some fine Mediterranean food,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/saeed42
40,Ice Skating?!? Yes!,"Most of the time, Pershing Square is pretty forgettable. However, during the holiday season from Thanksgiving through Christmas to MLK's birthday, it is transformed into an outdoor skating rink(!). Yes, you read that right. Hosted by the local hockey team, a decent size rink is installed. Skates are available for rental at reasonable prices. If you're in town, I highly recommend you check out this attraction. I'd recommend going during a week night to avoid the crowds. It is a lovely little scene with vendors selling hot chocolate and hot dogs. It seems to get better every year. Pershing Square is located next to a station of the same name on the Red Line. Parking is plentiful. Any concerns about safety downtown are completely unfounded. Afterwards, you can cross the street and have a drink at the distinguished Biltmore hotel.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HitchKennedy
