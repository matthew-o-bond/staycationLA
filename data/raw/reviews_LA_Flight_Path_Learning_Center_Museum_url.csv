50,Great museum,This a a small aviation museum very interesting. It has lots to offer. Aerospace included a lot of vintage items. A great affordable museum to visit $5 donation is all you pay. It is at the end of a runway at Lax,Jody V
50,Daytrip,"Excellent small learning center that is focused on flight and LAX. Our docent, Ann, was acceptedly knowledgeable and entertaining. We spent around 90 minutes there including time in LAX's south runway. Cost is only a $5 donation.",Scott4023
50,First-class All the Way,"Flightpath is a real trip. Sitting at the end of an LAX runway, the building is a little LA retro--think Rockford Files--and inside is a treasure trove of airline and aeronautical artifacts and history. I love looking at all the variations on the theme of Flight Attendant Uniform. Each one tells a story. It's an easy-going place--accessible,not-too-big, plenty of parking. The volunteers are very friendly, just like the skies they used to fly.",TrailBlazer798581
50,Incredible staff and collection of Aviation memorabilia,"A fantastic collection of aviation Memorabilia in an old airport terminal. The collections are from different airlines from around the world, but with an emphasis on US airlines as you would expect. However that was great. There was also history on LAX. There is also the opportunity to go outside with a guide and watch aircraft depart/land or almost as good view this from inside the Museum. Also for the AV Geeks there is a live Scanner going so you can listen to the ATC. Toilets and parking available. Entry is free of charge",Anthony S
50,Incredible,"So much bigger then it first looks, an amazing place for this #avgeek.Explains the history of LAX, has cases full of relics from airlines of long ago and today, a room full of uniforms, a space exhibit and so much more.Besides that awesomeness, you can look into a DC3 on the ramp, which also gives you access to near the tarmac to watch the planes taking off.On top of all that it is free (donation suggested) and the volunteers are full of info and happy to help/explain things.Incredible place, so glad i visited and recommend you doOn top of all that",PlateMan
50,Great Aviation Museum,"What a pleasant surprise. This museum is in one of the old terminals of LAX and very easy to get to. For anyone interested in the airlines that fly in and out of LAX and the history of LAX this is a must. Displays are loaded with memorabilia, photos and uniforms from the last almost 90 years. I was very impressed by the staff, they were very warm and welcoming. It only takes about an hour and well worth the trip",corvette2005
50,Awesome Musuem if you love Aviation,The Flight Path Museum is simply awesome. I was staying across the street at the Embassy Suites and wanted to visit Clutter's Park and the Flight Path Museum during my overnight layover. The volunteers at the front desk and those showing folks around were super friendly and knowledgeable. Admission is free and I encourage everyone to live a donation of a few bucks. This is a special museum and it is an excellent place to see and understand aviation history. It's great for air travel enthusiasts or just anybody wanting to see how flying used to be. Highly recommended and enjoy the runway views.,st25w
50,Flightpath Soars into Legendary Status,I had to visit the Flightpath museum twice because I was partly in shock the first time at how incredible my experience was. There are loads of aviation and LAX info & memorabilia but the highlight is definitely the DC-3 out on the tarmac that you can enter. Our hosts were ex flight attendants that were incredibly gracious and knowledgeable. A highlight of the second trip was that a British Airways Airbus A-380 was parked beside the DC-3. OH AND THE BEST THING: this musuem IS TOTALLY FREE,Jodel
40,Relive Some Aviation History,"I walked through Flight Path Learning Center & Museum during a recent trip to LAX and enjoyed seeing the history of commercial aviation laid out in front of me. You see a number of flight attendant uniforms, liveries from different airlines, merchandise and other aviation memorabilia. Everything was very well labeled and the staff was friendly and chatted me up a couple of times.It is hard to find the Flight Path Learning Center & Museum, so if you want to go before a flight, give yourself plenty of time to get to LAX. It isn't with the main terminals, so you will have to ask for directions. I would recommend Uber or driving yourself over.",Dave D
40,LAX History,"Located right next to LAX, museum contains a brief history of LAX and lots of airline artifacts. Flight attendant and Captain uniforms, models, photographs and airline schedules are part of the collection. Also great views of LAX tarmac activity with a radio monitoring ATC communications. Admission and parking are free. Great for those who appreciate the heydays of modern aviation.",6_Speed_Automatic
10,Tried to find this place but couldn’t,Headed to the airport early to visit this place. Couldn’t find it by car or by foot as no signs anywhere. Disappointing.,Northern_Harlequin
50,Flight path museum,"Brought my 11 year old and three of his friends for a visit. This place kept them entertained for at least a good solid 90 minutes. They have lots of model planes and artifacts on aviation history. Probably the most elaborate part of the collection is all the flight attendant uniforms over the years. Once we were done looking through the museum they took us out to see the spirit of 76 plane. Kids had a blast pretending to be passengers on the plane and then going into the cockpit and pretending to be the pilot/co-pilot.Admission is free and the place is run by super friendly and informative volunteers. I also learned that they will be starting a flight simulator class - ~$20 fee for 6 Saturdays, 3 hours each Saturday.",javan743
50,"Outstanding for anyone interested in aviation, travel, or fashion","Our family loved our visit to Flight Path! The staff / volunteers are so helpful. We really enjoyed getting to walk out on the apron to visit the vintage DC-3 airplane, fuel truck, and massive retired LAX airport fire / rescue truck - seeing / hearing the planes arriving and departing from the south complex was a treat too. Even if airplanes are not your thing, the exhibits on crew fashions through the years and airline signage and posters are fascinating. We wish we had more time and will definitely be back!",JPinALA
50,LAX Commercial Aviation Museum,This place attracts children and passionate aviation enthusiasts! I volunteer there enjoying LAX airfield view and boarding DC-3 with visitors. Ample parking and free admission offered! It is a hidden jewel!,Susan R
50,Waiting for Landing and taking-off LAX,Firmer Imperial Terminal of LAX very interesting jump in a AeroMuseum with lot of jewels to look at. For those who likes understanding about flights etc.,Gian Luca V
50,This Place Is Definitely a Gem!,"We stumbled onto this museum on the south perimeter of LAX Airport and were pleasantly surprised at what lay inside. Virtually the entire history of the airlines is told in this amazing collection of artifacts. Howard Hughes' personal DC-3 is part of the collection, which you are invited to see on the flight line. Posters, models, uniforms, patches -- it's all here. Don't pass this one up!",Mark D
50,Hidden Treasure,"The flight path museum is located at LAX in a former charter airline terminal. The exhibits are fantastic but the docents are even better.. Anne, who was retiring that week, has been in the airline industry for 5o years!!! She will be returning as a volunteer so be sure to ask for her to compliment your visit. A must see!",brooklyngirl43
50,Super fantastic - must visit if you want to experience the good 'ol days,This museum captures a golden era of commercial aviation in a very streamlined but thoughtful presentation. Take a trip back in time and you will realize some of what we have lost in our quest for progress. I think just about everyone would enjoy this place!,johnc_19
50,Excellent Experience!,"Located in the former Imperial Terminal at LAX, the museum includes a former Unocal (Union Oil of California) DC-3 corporate aircraft which is located on the tarmac and is available to tour while at the museum. Displays of former flight uniforms (pilots and flight attendants) is very nice as well as displays of history of LAX and the airlines which have served LAX over the years. Marie was very nice and helpful, provided a great deal of information about the development of LAX and the items displayed within the Learning Center and Museum.",Jason K
40,Historical,"Located right on the LAX site, it provided a nice interlude to our extra hour and a half in Los Angeles. Former airline stewardesses were knowledgeable docents, display models and photographs of famous early flyers were interesting, and we liked the tour of the early 1930's 24 passenger plane. As flight travel continues to change, this museum will become even more of an important icon as it displays the way things were, and are no longer.",drinafriedTRIPS
50,Great Museum!,"This is a wonderful little aviation museum located on the LAX Airport property. They have great views of the airport, A very interesting collection and a DC 3 Aircraft that you can actually go in. The staff was very helpful and kind and they know a lot about the museum collection. This is a must see for any aviation enthusiast visiting LAX.",whamil2n
50,What A Gem and its FREE!,"I organized a visit for my cub scout den and we were all thrilled! Good for the whole family and friends.It takes about 90 minutes to tour.The center is adjacent to an active runway. They have a huge/interesting display of plane models and uniforms, have a timeline of LAX that they walk you through, a few short/interesting movies, and they allow you to board a DC-3 and a fire truck. Great for pictures, great for history and knowing the history of LAX.They can arrange a special tour for groups and sometimes bring in the LAX canine unit from next door to talk about their role in airline safety.For those 14 and older they have a 6 week flight simulator school taught by a pilot for only $20!",al h
30,Very interesting aviaion museum,"If you are near LAX, take the time to explore the Flight Path Museum. It is easy to get to on the south side of the airport and offers some interesting displays of U.S. aviation history.",buffalojim67
50,Wow. This is a great stop for anyone.,"Situated just off of Imperial Highway on the south side of LAX this is a great free museum. It is a history of air travel in the Los Angeles area. It deals a little more specifically with airlines but covers some other aspects as well. First I was greated by some great volunteers that seemed to be more invested in the subject matter than a lot of other museums that I have been too. There are several displays of pilot and flight attendant uniforms from different time periods and airlines. There are several displays of airline swag or branded items from those periods as well. Also outside there is a DC-3 that is a former executive aircraft for Union 76 and TWA airliner, make sure that you ask them to take you out to see this. I will go back again and take my father when we go back to LA.It might just be me, but after visiting I had Frank Sinatra stuck in my head all day.I will definitely be back to this one.",craig c
40,An amazing little museum!,"Our ladies' group went to this museum and were pleasantly surprised. It houses commercial airline memorabilia that includes uniforms, photographs, a DC-3, signs, pins, airplane models and much more. Ann was our wonderful docent. She started off the visit with a video and we met the woman who was responsible for the creation of the museum. She has worked at LAX for 60 years. Wow!! Ann made sure we saw the highlights and then turned us loose. This is a free venue but donations are gladly accepted. We thought $10 per person was appropriate. If you get Ann to lead you, you will too. Go and learn!!! BTW, we arrived at 10:00 when it opens, stayed until 11:30 a.m. and no one else came in. This made it quite relaxing.",MaryLouise H
50,Best kept secret at LAX,Superb collection of airline memorabilia presented on the side of the South runways at LAX. the staff of volunteers is the friendliest and extremely knowledgeable. Nice place also to snap a photo or 2 of the landing jets on the runway 25 R or taxiing arriving flight on the runway 25 L.,jean louis D
50,"Interesting, small museum","We found out about this place by reading Trip Advisor. We had to check out of our hotel and didn't have enough time to go elsewhere. We would have been disappointed if we missed the opportunity to meet the lovely staff and volunteers that work here. They are full of such knowledge from their own experiences. I especially enjoyed seeing how the uniforms of the flight attendants have changed over the years. Adults and kids would love to visit here, and it's free ( they have a donation box).",Sharon N
50,GREAT LITTLE MUSEUM ABOUT COMMERCIAL FLIGHT,This is a true gem of a museum that almost nobody knows about. The museum is jam packed with displays of commercial aviation stuff and history of the air lines and LAX air port. The docents are very informative of the displays and very happy to answer questions. We only spent about an hour viewing the many rooms of the museum after we had attended one of the lecture series they had. We will be coming back soon when we can spend more time and the staff is not so busy with the lecture preparations.The museum visit is free and really needs about 2 hours to fully enjoy the exhibits more if you are really an air line buff or worked in the air line industry.I have lived and worked around the LA airport all of my life and never heard about this wonderful museum.I will also be checking the schedules of there speaker series and plan on attending some more lectures. The pretzels to prime rib lecture history of food in flight was fantastic.,707clayg
50,Remember Them?,"BOAC, TWA, Pan Am, PSA . . . Remember them? They're all here and many more! This is a free, little Museum where you can learn about Los Angeles International Airport and many of the commercial airlines that used to fly there. A load of old model aircraft, flight uniforms, travel posters, dinner service sets for passengers, and other displays - even a collection of old passenger seats. There is even a DC-3 you can tour and sit in! Outstanding! Combine this with lunch at the 'Proud Bird Restaurant' on Aviation Blvd. just to the east a few blocks. Get to this museum by driving west on the 105 Freeway till it ends. Look to your right, and it is there. Enjoy!",etweeden
50,A Real Treasure of a Museum,"The Flight Path Learning Center and Museum is a treasure. Arrived on a Saturday morning when they opened at 10 am and easily spent a few hours wandering.The docents who volunteer their time are fantastic. They are excited to share the history of the museum as they guide you through the exhibits. This museum gives a history of flight and LAX.The displays, photos and exhibits give a history of flight including china used when flying use to be fun, an endless supply of flight attendant, and pilot uniforms from all airlines dating back to the beginning.Just when you think you are coming to the end, you will stumble on another room with more history, photos of LAX, airport history and airline exhibits.We were fortunate to meet the woman who spearheaded the museum starting in 1995 and has worked tirelessly with a group of volunteers to provide this museum for us to enjoy.They have an old DC3 plane on property. With a docent you can board the plane, walk the aisle sit in the cockpit, which is very cool.One room has several large glass cases that house the collection of one man who displays metal models of all the airlines. One case houses models of planes that he painstakingly built, they are exquisite and perfect down to every little detail.There is no charge for the museum, but they do accept donations. We will definitely go back and will take guests.If you are dropping someone at the airport and can plan your visit a few hours before their flight, I highly recommend it.",beetrvln
50,Even my 90 year old Mother-in-law enjoyed this!,"I share everyone else's enthusiasm for this totally free GEM. It's absolutely great! So very good that it is WELL worth a donation of anything you feel like contributing.Wife and I spent a couple of hours here, one afternoon, and found such a wealth of interesting photos, clothing, absolutely superb scale model planes and other memorabilia that we brought her Mom back the next day and she enjoyed it every bit as much as we did! There is something of interest for almost everyone, not least a wide ranging view of current air-plane activity in and out of LAX, on whose land this ""Museum"" stands. All greatly enhanced by cheerfully enthusiastic 'docents' of both genders, who all seem to have been deeply involved with planes or airlines for years and years.It's much bigger than it first seems and it was only towards the end of our second visit that I discovered the aero-space area and then yet another area where a retired pilot was expertly demonstrating flight simulations on a computer. Like everyone else there, he was enthusiastically forthcoming about what he used to do (fly planes of course!) and what he does now, which is train would-be pilots to a high standard of proficiency using the several PCs in this room. There's no age limit on this course and, without a doubt, I'm going to sign up for one of his flight sim courses next time I'm in LA. I can hardly wait! :-)",John-Tropi
50,"YES, we went again!","Just cannot be in this area and not pay a visit to this Museum. It is still a ""must"" for us. This time, we took our son along. He has lived in Manhattan Beach for close to 20 years, and just about resides at LAX ( he's a 1K passenger), yet never knew that this Museum existed.The three of us had a wonderful morning. There's a huge Russian cargo plane parked right next door to the Museum now, and it was exciting to see it. Since last year, they have received new donations, and extended the Museum by opening more rooms. We watched the videos again, admired the lovely vintage flight attendant uniforms, and looked through all the display cases.The volunteers here are incredible as they are so knowledgeable, and so very interesting. You could spend hours listening to their stories about the aviation industry. This is one of our favorite attractions in Southern California.",NYU62
40,Great way to spend a couple of hours,"If your at LAX and have a few hours to kill this is a great place to go. Forthe history buff you won't be disappointed. For the girls heaps of the origional uniforms and paraphernalia, the kids are sure to like it. And the staff are great. Free entry. donations gratefully accepted.",Patrick S
50,An Outstanding Flight Museum!,"This museum offers something for everyone interested in aviation. Exhibits, information, and photographs from the past and the present are in abundance throughout the museum. The staff are very friendly, helpful, and eager to help. For photography buffs, there is a clear view of the runway adjacent to the museum for photographs. Parking and museum admission are free. Overall, highly recommended!",Robert V
50,Support this,"What a great place to visit, and staff care about 'their baby' and want you to have a great time as well.This place is a well-documented travel through time of LAX airport from its inception. Full of incredible, and personal, memorabilia and staffed by people that worked at LAX.The DC3 is well preserved and the highlight of the visit.Go there.",Gerry C
50,Flight path museum,"This was really interesting. We even listened in to the control tower directing aircraft. There is also an old DC3 which was converted to a private jet which you can go on - that in itself is worth it - the ladies there are so knowledgeable - they have been doing it for 30 years plus, One of the ladies is an ex flight attendant. All the old uniforms were amazing.",bonzaAustralia
50,for aviation buffs,"This is a little-known gem located on the edge of one of the runways at LAX. The museum is full of aviation memorabilia with an emphasis on the history and development of LAX. I can confirm earlier posts raving about the helpful docents who clearly have a passion for aviation. Of special interest is an old DC3 retired by Union 76 that can be toured, as well as a flight simulation training program available to the public - several 3 hour sessions for a nominal fee upon application.",figgie32313
50,Great place to take the kids for free!,"This museum has so much fun LAX memorabilia. It is fun for me to go, as I grew up a child of a flight attendant in the area, and it's fun to show my kids some of the stuff from their Grandma's job.There is a really neat old DC-3 outside that you can walk around in, and at that point, you are actually on the runway!The volunteer at the museum who showed us around was so knowledgable, kind, and helpful. He really enjoyed what he was doing. He turned on the scanner for us to hear the control tower, and answered ALL our questions.We only had 45 minutes, and we were able to do so much!We will definitely be back!",Simple M
50,The Flight Path Is A Real Gem,"The Flight Path Learning Center is a true gem. It is located on the property of Los Angeles International Airport along Imperial Way, on the south side for those who don't know the area. Even though it is relatively small, it has a great story to tell and it does a very good job telling the tale.Displays are ""in context"" so it is easy to understand how all the components come together. The are plenty of top-level professional models, these are of the type that the aircraft manufacturers build. They help visitors understand the concepts. A classic example is the stunning Flying Tigers cut-away airplane model that, well, honestly, seeing it is much better than me trying to explain it.Withing moments of my arrival I was invited to take a tour of the museum's DC3. What a great treat! If you have the opportunity to do this, please do. Imagine how air travel was in the good old days.One other thing, be sure to bring your camera. The LAX runways are ""right out there"" and you will have a swell time during your visit.The museum has the best collection of aircrew uniforms that you could possibly imagine. Did the flight attendants really wear that??? Oh, my!If there's a downside it is that the hours are limited. Check the Web site http://flightpathmuseum.com to be sure, but this day they were 10am to 3pm. Adjust your plans so that you can get there. It is worth it.Admission is a volunteer donation. Toss in a big bill to keep this place running.",Rogerl53
50,"Such a delight, made for a great day!",I was dropping my parents off at LAX and had done some research on attractions near the airport; where I stumbled upon this museum. I am so glad we did!! From the moment we entered we were greeted by a staff member who gave us an excellent introduction. Throughout our time there we interacted w a number of the staff and volunteers and all were so excellent! Very friendly and helpful: it really enhanced the experience. Half the museum has giant windows that face where the planes land which is really inpressive to see. Excellent memorabilia there and good lesson in the history of flight as well as LAX itself.They even had coffee and cookies (which were both delicious).,Debbie S
50,Try not to miss this treasure of the past,"We found ourselves in Southern California again the first week of May, and were very busy with family and friends, but just had to sneak away to visit this Museum again. We are not frequent flyers, nor are we in any way associated with the aviation industry. Yet, this very well taken care of Museum links us to a certain past, and we could (and did) spend hours there.Since this was our second visit, we thought that we could cover it in an hour or so. And AGAIN, we were there for three hours. Just talking to the volunteers is so informative. We walked through all the rooms, and saw things that we had missed seeing the first time. Again, we were there on a Friday (5/9) and that definitely is the day to go, as you pretty much have the place to yourself. School groups come through on the other days.The closeness to LAX, and the huge windows provide the best viewing of planes taking off and landing on the runways. And it is not a partial view. One can see the entire operation.I know that we will try to drop in every single time we are in LA, as this Museum is so fascinating.",NYU62
50,Great museum!,"Super close to the hotel, visit this if you have time. Only one airplane you can walk through but the museum inside is so cool.",Michael R
50,"Fantastic gem tucked next to LAX runway, highly recommended!","Very nice to see this attraction now listed on TripAdvisor!When most people are at, or through LAX, maybe they're in a hurry or doing the commuter thing, etc. Well, you likely won't see LAX or other airports the same after you've visited this museum and learning center!What a great place! Absolutely filled with LAX and general aviation history. For those who like museums and/or history and/or aviation, or even if you're not really that into those kinds of things, it's a really, really wonderful attraction. It's amazing how they've managed to make a museum that caters to so many levels of interest. Kids and adults, history, technology, sociology, fashion, marketing, aeronautics, etc. I've been there twice and I feel like I see and learn new stuff every time. It is a Museum and Learning Center"" and certainly fits the bill.You can check out a bit at http://www.flightpath.us/ or http://flightpathmuseum.com/ , and it also has a Research Center. It's open 1000-1500 Tuesday through Saturday (closed public holidays.)And it's free (parking too)!! They do accept donations, and it's such an excellent place and the staff are so nice I certainly donate something every time I'm there (they certainly won't ask you, but after seeing the place you'll certainly want to donate something).There's so much in there it's rather deceptive, like a Tardis, as the building from the outside looks deceptively...well, not as enormous as when you get inside.Some aviation museums focus on having restored aircraft, and are really aircraft museums, where this is a true aviation museum with all aspects (and I mean ALL) of aviation on display. There's a very cool DC-3 outside right next to the runway that you can go through with a guide and there's military aviation and....well everything one could imagine about aviation and aviation history in there as well. Extremely well done.And in no way is it solely about LAX, although that's certainly a main focus. The exhibits themselves are very well laid out and the guides are largely those who have worked in the industry and are both keen to help visitors interpret, answer questions and generally help out. It is a true (so far) seemingly undiscovered gem for visitors and residents of the area. If you have a layover at LAX you can get there in about 5 min (no underestimate) by car and there's a bus route from LAX that will drop you off near there as well. I know, some international friends did a layover and went there that way.For flight crews in LA this is an absolute must-see. If you ever wanted to see a fantastically presented inside-history of your industry, this is certainly it. Considering what a hard time the airline industry (and employees) get sometimes these days, it's really inspiring and makes one proud of the industry's accomplishments, employee or not.It also has a beautiful picture window looking out on one of the busiest runways with big comfortable chairs and often a coffee/tea stand there as well. One of the best (if not the best) place to watch the planes taking off and landing. In fact, I see the DC-3 every time I land on 25L or 25R or 7L/7R and now that I've pointed it out to flight crews they say, ""I always wondered what that was"".It's on Imperial Blvd., so right adjacent to LAX (runway's right out the back) and it seems like most visitors have the same impression....why isn't this place more well known? It's certainly one of LA's best kept ""secrets"". And almost everyone who goes there comes away enthusing about the place (check out additional reviews on Yelp, etc.), including me.Keep your eyes out as it's in the old Imperial Terminal building on the N (airport) side of Imperial Blvd. They have a flag pole so there will be the flag, and a sort of Art Deco concrete wall made up of what look like stacks of short pipes. They usually also have a banner on the wall and I believe there's a small billboard sign as well by the road.And one last thing. It has to be the cleanest museum I've ever seen! Like all the exhibits are dusted and polished daily or something. And the uniforms and old signs and really all the ""older"" stuff looks like it's brand new, even though it's not. So they have some amazing conservators.Very enjoyable place and very much recommended.",Tryne
50,A most unique and wonderful Museum. A MUST for aviation buffs.,"Not sure as to when this Museum opened, but we had never heard of it, until the librarian at the ""Automobile Driving Museum"" (El Segundo) told us about it. Not only that, but none of our friends in the LA area knew about it. Not even listed with TripAdvisor (until I submitted the information). That is all incredible, as this is such an amazing place, and a definite ""must"" for anybody who is interested in past airline history and aviation.Since we found no information about it, we figured this must be a one half to one hour deal. We spent over 3 hours there, and left only because they do close at 3 pm., and it was near that time. Admission and parking (lot attached) are free.There are rooms full of fascinating exhibits, beginning with vintage luggage and ending with vintage flight attendant uniforms (one is even by the great designer Emilio Pucci!). There are vintage posters, exhibits of the various airlines (past and present), displays of the carry-ons of the 1950s-1990s, and of the ashtrays, glasses, dishes, menus, etc. of the different airlines. Music of that time is played, including a very catchy song titled ""L.A. International Airport"" sung by Susan Raye. There is an 8 minute video shown of the arrival of the Space Shuttle Endeavour in Los Angeles last year. Also, one can enter a DC-3, to see what an executive jet looked like at that time. For this, a volunteer must escort you, as it is too close to the runways of LAX.As this Museum sits on LAX property, it is VERY close to the actual airport. There are benches outside, where one can sit and watch planes taking off and landing. Inside, you can do the same by sitting on comfortable chairs by the huge picture windows. I doubt that one could get a better view of this activity (planes on runways) than from this vantage point.The volunteers are all very nice. Most of them have worked in the industry, and can answer any questions you ask. There is a small bookcase where you can purchase some souvenirs, plus LAX postcards (those are 25 cents each and they are beautiful), plus they have postcards from some airlines for sale (also 25 cents apiece).We were there on Friday (9/13) and it was very quiet ! Doesn't anybody know about this wonderful place? However, one volunteer told us that many school groups come through each week, and we were lucky, as this way we pretty much had the place to ourselves. (I think Friday is the day that there are no field trips.)Anytime, we will go to Southern California, we will stop by, as there is still so much more to see, and to us, it was so very fascinating.",NYU62
