30,Not quite that easy to access,"We thought that we would do a little bit of walking at the Wetlands (see some birds). Did not really happen as there were not great signs to inform you of where to go. We ended up driving around, parking and viewing a few birds. Disappointing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PA_Denizen
40,Birding near the ocean and city,"What a great little spot this is for a nice walk. Close to LAX, the Ballona Wetlands have been set aside as an important flyover site for birds. You'll see plenty here, and the flat, easy walk is only interrupted by busy Lincoln Blvd. sounds. We saw plenty of water fowl and song birds in our hour here. Afterwards, head to Playa del Rey, stroll the beach, have a bite at Playa Provisions. This tiny corner of LA feels very remote!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/plumeriad2017
50,Excellent place for Bird watching/photographing,"Ballona Wetlands has three different parts.. freshwater marsh, saltwater marsh and a dune area. FreshWater marsh is next to PCH and has a nice place to walk around and photography for birds are very doable. You can not go inside the wetland without a guide or bird walk days, but there are area adjacent to the wetland with clear wetland views.I went with bird walk group and it is pretty enjoyable.If you are planning to go for hike or exercise this is not the place to go. Find some place else, there is a bike path nearby.There are a few benches to sit down and enjoy the nature. Bring young kids of your life and enjoy hour or so.Salt water marsh part are mostly closed and one can see on few dates for clean up dates ( if you promise and do clean up some weeds or unwanted plants, help them with restoration process). I got a very nice Snowy Egret picturein this trip.I am going to explore the area more in future for photography and just for the calmness of the place.Amount of effort the organization put up is amazing.I gave 5 star mostly for their effort to preserve this place for future generation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/keks64
40,"A must do if you cycle, or want to cycle in LA.","An L.A treasure.Riding my bike down Ballona Creek is one of my favorite things in the world. If you can get a windless afternoon in fall, all the better.Recently upgraded, beautified by the Parks Commission - this has to be one of the best bike paths in the city. From Hermosa Beach north to Marina Del Rey and then either up the aqua duct into Culver or westward to Venice and Santa Monica - it offers you a nice 10, 20 or 30 mile return ride along the ocean and waterways of LA.A must do if you cycle, or want to cycle LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HutchinLA
40,"Wetlands, Hidden in Plain Sight ...","I've watched the Ballona Wetlands area over the years, first when Howard Hughes Airport abutted it, and now the Playa Vista development just across Lincoln. Walking it allows for seeing local and migratory birds, as well as wildlife. Glad that the area has been preserved & not developed. Has a nature trail to walk. Gets better each year. Enjoy. ...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dblmed
40,Wetland Area and Place to See Birds: Ballona Wetlands,We have visited Ballona Wetlands. There is a group that is working to restore the area called Friends of Ballona Wetlands.Ballona Wetlands is one of the last wetlands in the area. We like to see the birds here.The efforts of those working to restore this area is the reason for my rating. Its nice to see locals working together to restore the natural areas given how much high rising building in the area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mini
40,Walking,"These wetlands have a perfect little walking path that runs along them. It provides a nice trail for walking or running that gets you away from the street. It's not the nicest nature you've ever seen, but it's still nice to have. The houses that line it are also cool to checkout. Most are pretty fancy and fun to dream about.The path also connects Marina Del Rey to Venice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kljack19
40,easy place to see birds.,we went there in jan ant the wife saw plenty of different birds. easy walking paths around the path so anyone should be able to do it also.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/knuckledragger70
10,Nothing there,We were in marina del rey and decided to try this. Put in th directions provided and did not find the place. We then searched the Web made sure the directions were correct and still did not find a thing at the spot.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ofrit_manor
40,An oasis for nature,"An oasis for wildlife in the midst of so much concrete and well worth a few hours for anyone interested in nature. It almost ended up as an extension to the concrete of Marina del Rey, but was saved by activists and is now being slowly restored as a wetland area.We were not in town at the right time to attend any of the organised tours, but spent about three hours slowly walking the paths. As a reward we saw green herons, egrets and white-tailed kite as well as many others that we, not being Americans, did not immediately recognise.During the whole time we saw only three other people.As an aside, there are signs advising that insect repellent be used because of the risk of mosquitos, so be sure to bring some.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Arderyth
50,A relaxing and informative tour in nature,"I live in Venice, CA and saw a listing for the walking tour in one of the local newspapers (the salt water 2 hour tour). Having no other plans I decided to go. The tour guide, Robert (or Roy), was friendly, very relaxed and very knowledgable. I learned so much (which I've already forgotten!). I went by myself but very quickly felt like I was walking through the wetlands with distance relatives (in a good way). It was pretty cool to go through the locked fences, like having a backstage pass to the wetlands. There were so many rare birds around that day that our tour actually lasted 3 and 1/2 hours (you could leave earlier if you wanted to). I'm not a person who's attention span can always last that long, but I was having a great time. I think this tour is only every 2nd Sunday of the month (check the website). Tip: they do pass out Binoculars and set up a good pair on a tripod for the special birds, but if you have a really good pair then bring those!If you want to do something low-key and outdoors this is a great tour. Check the weather before you come - somtimes it's much colder by the beach!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christamcc
