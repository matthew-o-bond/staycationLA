50,“Beautiful place and people”,Having a great time in Addis Ababa!!!!! Lots to see and learn about. Dress appropriately in case it rains.
50,“Mercado/guide”,"We were so fortunate to run into Kibru Tesfa at the airport. He was chatting with someone else but took pity on us as we waited for quite a while for our shuttle. He introduced himself as a guide and we contacted him the next day to take us shopping and to experience a coffee ceremony. He took us through the overwhelming Mercado with ease. He found the items we were looking for, negotiated prices and even kept us from being hounded by other over-eager sales people. He even negotiated having alterations put into a purse I bought. Not only was he knowledgable about the city, country and history, but he is very personable and allowed us to get to know him and his family. When we go back, we will definitely contact him to take us around. Kibruyisfa Testfa, guidekibru2004@gmail.com, to contact him."
50,“13 months of sunshine”,"Ethiopia is one of those countries you are drawn back to time and again. My husband has had several International consultancy work here so have lived and now constantly visit as we have so many friends and colleagues there. at the moment Addis is like a building site as new hotels and restaurants are springing up and there is an overhead transit rail line being built, not to mention the new roads. In a few years it will rival some of the bigger international cities around the world. However, there is still lots to see and do. There are some great photo shots of the city from surrounding hills, magnificent churches, museums, old buildings and excellent spicy foods to try and extremely friendly and hospitable people to meet."
30,“city of potential”,fantastic friendly people....a city and country of exceptional potential and growth opportunities...would love to go back soon
50,“The safest friendlier city in Africa”,"There is a lot of historic museums and places to see in this city.I liked the fresh food, the hospitality of the people, the mountain view, the museums, specially the Ethnological museum.I did not like the Zoo. It's too small. And the lions look very sad. for someone who believes that animals belong to the wild to see them in a small cages."
30,"“Good city, but still in a poor, developing country”","It is certainly an experience to visit Addis Ababa, and the city is one of the most approachable large cities in Africa in terms of safety and security. However, still not a beautiful city for tourism, quite poor, and the attractions are not very well developed."
50,“day tour with Temesgan Bitewlign - he is fabulous!”,"I was in Addis a few weeks ago on a business trip and decided to stay one extra day to see a bit of the country. I'm so very glad I did this. Temesgan was recommended to me by a friend in New York, so I had arranged with him to hire a driver and take me someplace cool......which he did.....we drove three hours outside of Addis to a beautiful crater lake and hiked down to the lake. From there we took a rowboat out to a beautiful church and walked around this uniquely beautiful place.Temesgan is an amazing tour guide. His English is perfect, he knows the history and current events of the country inside-out, and he's just a lovely guy to spend time with. I highly recomment him as a tour guide if you are lucky enough to be spending time in fabulous Ethiopia. I will be back, soo, I hope. when I do come back, I will definitely be calling him. Loved the country, people, culture, landscape & food.....a very cool country!Price from Hamilton, Bermuda"
50,“Addis Ababa”,Well first of all me and my sister are named after the capital of Ethiopia which is Addis Ababa ( Addis Is my name) But that's not the point. The point is when you go there you'll feel at home and it will change the way you look at life. I want to go back again!
30,“Old Majestic Addis”,This sprawling metropolis has a strange mixture of African decadence and religious splendour .Sprawled in the city of idlers ( no jobs) people strutting here and there and yet the Churches have all ostentatious symbols .There are universities which are big and busy and restaurants for tourist's delight ...Taxi drivers tend to overcharge and it is better to agree to places of interest you wish to visit in the trip before boarding one .
50,“addis abab is interesting city from which i have visited countries specially the people”,very kind people positive attitude and has very interesting city and national museumwith miracle lucy skeleton
30,“Fascinating culture. Limited infrastructure. ”,"Ethiopia has a unique culture, and friendly if somewhat retiring people. I always felt safe on the chaotic streets even though I never saw a policeman. Very little in the way of tourist infrastructure, and the city is full of rubble due to the building boom. The continent's largest open air market 'Merkato' is a must see for the resilient and brave. For the intrepid traveller I recommend a visit before it becomes a tourist trap."
40,“One has to believe the growth of this city”,I am visiting Addis Ababa since last 12 years or more. I have witnessed the development of infrastructure during last 5 years. What a growth! Unbelievable. One thing I would like to say is about people of Ethiopia. Ethiopians are very good at heart and one can trust for everything. I love this city and Ethiopian food too.
50,“Nice Place”,Good weather and very friendly people - Absolutely a safe city - cabs are easily available but I suggest to hire the hotel tourist cab for easy travel to places of interest
50,“Nice place to visit”,I walked daily to enjoy the place.....safe place .....nice people .... lot of homeless present everywhere ...lot of beggars .....lot of people walking everywhere.....
40,“Travel in Ethiopia”,"Hello,douglas I’m from GermanyA week ago I came back from Ethiopia .I spent around 1 month there.As I’m so impressed I just wanted to share my experience with more people.Unexpected for me I met awesome people .Many many greetings to our tour company.The guy who organized all trip is called Alebachew Abebe- Alex.I fully appreciate the great job that he has done.Alex – thank you so much.This is his email alebachew_2005@yahoo.comhttp://www.simienmountains.com/I’ve traveled in a lots of countries,but for me this was the best support and service.We spent 8 days inSimien National park and all the time people from Alex’s company cared about us to feel comfortable.The chef was the best,his soups were delicious.The mountain guide-Irga was really good .He knew the names of all the birds,animals and flowers,all about geography and history of Ethiopia and it was very interesting to listening him.He makes us feel so nice in his company.For the people who love mountains I really recommend to visit Simien mountains.It’s definitely worth.Fantastic views and huge space around.Feels like in photo of National Geographic.To hike to the highest peak in Ethiopia was a great experience.From the cities mostly I was impressed by Lalibela and the rock"
50,"“Enthusiasm, Good Cheer and Relish in 1 package- Temesgen Bitewilgn”","I have never met a guide more passionate than Temsegen. As soon as I arrived in Addis Ababa, albeit for 1 day, he made me feel like Addis Ababa was now my second home!We embarked on an excellent guided tour of Addis Ababa and it is evident that Temsegen knows his city like the back of his palm, making it a wonderful experience overallI can safely say that I would recommend Temsegen without a doubt to anyone visiting Ethiopia"
50,“Words don't work!”,Addis Ababa is about the people and the culture not so much the sights. The feeling is special and the spicy food is great. Observe and absorb and let it change you!
30,“Experiencing culture”,"Very crowded, chaotic and busy. Just ok for me. I love traveling and would do it again, given the opportunity."
50,“Rustic Cosmopolitan!”,"A wonderful city, eclectic in nature. Benefitting from the fact that it is the political capital of AFRICA and therefore houses all races, creeds and colour. It offers food, drink, entertainment and more night life such as you would expect to find in any city housing more than 4.5million people. Ex-pats are not the only spenders as the middle-income Ethiopian's are a growing population. During the day visitors can visit a range of museums, old buildings, zoo and surrounding towns and villages. Guided tours are available through the international hotels and many of the indigenous starred hotels too! Ethiopian Quadrants will organise and deliver multi-day tours north, south east and west of Addis (as their name suggests) this company is managed by an Irish man known to all! Much of the history of Addis is still evident in its buildings and streets as well as its natives who are only too eager to help you remember your stay!"
30,“nothing really that special to see”,"nothing really that special to see, the red terror museum and the national museum (lucy museum) are ok, but you will find the more interesting things to do outside of addis ababa"
40,“Addis ababa Museum”,"Lovely people and place, Addis Museum is lovely place to see it. Lot of crowns wore by king and thrones are kept in this museum"
30,"“Vibrant, expanding city”","A city continuously expanding. Great people, great food and bad traffic. A visit to the mountain side just outside Addis is worth the effort and give a breathtaking with of the city on a clear day."
50,“Beauful people...inside and out”,I can genuinely say that Ethiopians are the nicest people I have ever met. Good Samaritan central. Even though you may need to haggle for a ride in a taxi...which you should pay about 50bir for within the city and 100bir to it's environs.
50,“A great city”,"Addis has been compared to a huge njera, all spread out and covered in a messy mix of dishes. It has charm, plenty of chaos and noise, and generally surprises the visitor at each step. Very different from other Africa cities, and generally more charming."
30,"“Just different, but I love peoplle of Adis!”","I was in Adis only 3 days, but it was really interesting. The land of coffee, marathon peoplle, very interesting traditions, meal, dancing. Of course, it is poor country- what do you want to expect? But peoplle- they are nice, poor, but enjoyng the life. They are very good runners and I didn't see any one fat.There are some very good traditional restaurants, where you can dance and eat very good. Of course- you can see a lot of dust and dirt, but- be positive. Peoplle is this land are living poor- what do you want to expect? All new lands and cities are good experience and giving a different opinion about the world."
20,"“Dirty, frenetic and not much to offer”","Pickpockets abound, the traffic is awful and the drivers all drive as if they had multi million dollar policies. The tourist attractions are woefully underfunded and in need of attention. Not much to offer for tourists. I wouldn't go back."
40,“Under construction but such a good vibe”,"Addis has a very good energy! Since the city is under massive construction with new buildings, hotels and restaurants but most importantly the light train! The food is amazing and people are nice."
20,“Dirty dusty city with few positives”,I have been to many developing countries and cities but Addis beats them all for its dirt and dust everywhere. Pick pockets abound (thankfully I escaped after warning) .The drivers are nightmarish.It is difficult to find anything positive to say about the city
30,“Must be tourist friendly”,"My first step on ""Africa"" was actually in Ethiopia, not including Egypt as ""Africa"", anyway, when I got out of the plane, it was 16degrees Celcius (60 degress Fahrenheit)! I thought Africa was suppose to be really hot, then later i found out its above 7000feet above sea level. I didnt have a chance to visit the churches or museums yet, but one thing I did notice was everything was so expensive!!!Especially in the airport, a bottle of coke was $5, elsewhere usually a dollar, anyway, even most shops, for a baseball cap was $30!!! wow, they really need to lower prices to make it more tourist friendly"
30,“Big capital city but still no much to do”,"During my trip to Ethiopia I send 2 days in Addis Ababa, it is several million people but still very undeveloped which many people might think is normal for an African country however Ethiopia is full of culture but just its not shown. By second day afternoon we didn't know what else to do, what kind of disappointing the tour guide himself said there are no more to see or visit."
40,"“Generous people, amazing food, see Lucy!”","It's a bustling city. Dilapidated infrastructure but the people are solid, the food amazing and the history museum in Addis Ababa is great, especially for kids learning about the development of Homo sapiens. Great exhibit on the timeline and of course the (replica) of Lucy's skeleton!"
50,"“A brilliant city, buzzing with life - just don't expect to get much sleep”","The city is loads of fun - absolutely buzzing with life! Much of the enjoyment of visiting Addis is soaking up the atmosphere itself rather than visiting the tourist attractions, many of which were disappointing - particularly the museums. Great food, helpful taxi drivers and even though only about 1 in 10 of those we used had any idea where we wanted to go, they would call t heir friends or look at our maps and always get us where we wanted to be. The mercato is mad, biggest market in Africa and it certainly feels that way! You can get anything from a mattress to a pashmina to spices here, and it's certainly worth 2 hours wandering around to soak up the atmosphere. Recommend Lucy's restaurant attached to the National Museum - great traditional food and coffee!"
40,“Vibrant City”,"Addis is a vibrant, swiftly modernizing city. The streets are clogged with motor as well as people traffic. It is a symphony of sounds, many discordant, but all so human. It is dusty and crowded. Driving through the city seems an adventure for each outing."
40,“Good times”,"Addis is a great place to visit. The people are friendly and the food is good, if you know where to go. I have stayed at both the Sheraton and the Hilton. The service was great at both hotels."
40,“AN excellent introduction to Ethiopia”,Our tour of Addis Ababa was an excellent introduction to Ethiopia. It was very tiring as we had only arrived that morning after an overnight flight but the driver guide (Yama Tours) was careful to structure it so that we could cope with and enjoy it.
50,“Window to Ethiopia”,"Addis is changing every time I am there. Growing and rising with new hotels, shops and buildings. The charm is still there, I hope it will not be lost due to ""progress"""
40,“Addis on a budget”,As an innocent I got a phone stolen in the street . My fault for not being prepared . You need a good strong bag with good strong fastenings .The second attempt at pickpocketing was stopped by a stern word . This is not a violent place.I had a few beers in the local shipping container bars (real cheap ) and food in street level cafes . A very stern NO must be given to prospective 'guides' . They can be useful but are costly .Taxis are cheap and friendly . Do not haggle they are cheap ! And take a mobile number from driver . Night falls very quickly and you might need them.BEFORE YOU GO GET A MAP .There are a few no go areas but I never felt threatened .Going back this Xmas as they celebrate it in january .DON'T FLY AIR EGYPT OR VIA EGYPT !!!
30,“average place”,"overall an average place is know for its coffee so if u happen to be their dont miss iti landed their bcoz of transit i tried to explore the market in terms of my fabric business bt it was a bad ideawe went out to church entoto mountain, market its a nice placelanguage is an issue bigtimeso god save you in dealing with them"
40,“much easier than LP says”,"City is easy to travel, no problems with safety, scams.Taxis are relatively expense, including for locals. From Airport you will pay ca. 150 Birr.getting around with mini buses is no problem, people speak English and guide to get to the correct destination.Many construction sites (light rail, streets), likely in two years the city will look very different/ modern.Consider buying a local SIM card which can be done from most street vendors or shoe cleaners for ca. 120 Birr. No need to go to Ethiopia telecom.Domestic flights can be purchased for a few of 100 Birr at a travel agency (example across Edna Mall) which avoids long waiting line.Overall not more difficult than BKK."
50,"“Addis Ababa, a pleasant capital city”","Addis Ababa has interesting museums with the oldest skeleton 3.5 million years old Lucy, you can see the live markets (MERKATO). The Ethnological Museum for an overview of Ethiopia's history, culture and traditions, and collection, there are many nomadic tribes customs item."
50,"“an intense place to visit, but unlike any other place”","the traffic is insane and nothing about Addis is easy, but if you are looking to spend time in a place that is unique and interesting I highly recommend Addis."
40,“High Altitude Adventure”,"To start with, I have a knack for mountain adventures so when I headed for Addis, it was paradise come true. I enjoyed the mountain air, the fresh baked coffee beans at the bakery near by. I had the privilege of staying in one of addis ababa's up-skill residential apartments (CMC) near Gurd-Shola on your way to Iyat.Shopping at Mercato (Africa's Largest Open-air Market) was an interesting experience from bargaining prices with producers & getting authentic ethiopian Fabrics to cheap products such as cutlery etc. For those of you who enjoy a little decency and a touch of europe when shopping, then I recommend PIAZZA. The venue reminded me of rome & the strong italian influence in that country.The drive from asmara road to jomo-kenyatta road was the best experience for me in addis. You will get to drive by the Economic Commision of Africa (ECA), the African Union Building, the National Palace, Sheraton Hotel, Hilton Hotel, various embassies & consulates and oh! how can i forget....BOLE ROAD!!. You will get to see a wide range of shops from supermarkets to retail & commercial businesses. All in all Addis Ababa is an African Gem with Italian influence & a serious blend of many eastern cultures that intertwine to emerge as Africa's mega cities.I definitely recommend travellers to visit Addis & Ethiopia as a whole. The experience would not be regretted"
40,“Mercato”,"This was a great experience in Addis Ababa; I'm glad I went there. The guidebooks emphasized its size outdoors and it is indeed vast. It is also bustling, crowded and busy. That is part of its charm. I was glad my travel partner and I went with a local guide, because it would have been very easy to get lost. There is a terrific variety of things to buy, some new and some used. It is not what I would call a tourist bazaar, although you can find some woven items that will make authentic souvenirs. There are fresh vegetables and live chickens and recycled hardware bits and clothes ... it really goes on and on. It can be a bit overwhelming, so I recommend thinking twice if you want to go here just to go shopping for tourist trinkets. However, if you can go, you'll get a local experience that is amazing. If you have any physical challenges, please be aware this is not an ""easy stroll in the park"" at all due to the crowds, uneven ground, etc."
50,“The New Flower”,"Addis Ababa is a melting pot of the different cultures that make up Ethiopia. Located almost spot bang in the centre of the country, and among the rolling hills of the Ethiopian Highlands, it is one of Africa's highest cities at an altitude of 2,500 metres. As a result, the weather is a mild 18-30 degrees throughout. The different areas such as Mercato, Arat/Sidist Kilo, Hiya-Hulet, Bole, Mexico, Megenenya etc. all offer different vibes. Regardless of the money or where abouts in Addis that you are, you can always find a delicious restaurant or cafe to indulge in. If you are somehow tired of eating injera and wet (Ethiopian staple diet) than you can easily find western, indian or chinese restaurants in areas such as Bole. Throughout Addis Ababa there is an abundant nighlife scene. Big clubs, bars, and traditional azmari bets (ethiopian music and folklore) are scattered throughout the different areas of Addis. Many nice architectural feats, museums and cultural centres, as well as the Royal Palace and the Seat of the African Union are all here. Addis Ababa is always a growing city and already getting a name as one of Africa's mega cities. Definitely recommend it to travellers looking for a taste of an authentic East African Metropolis, and the gateway to visit the other amazing attractions throughout Ethiopia."
50,“Love this city”,Took some getting used to but after a couple of days I really liked Addis. The minibuses are an excellent and cheap way to get around. The people are friendly. The place is crazy and fun.
40,“A great stop over city”,"Addis is not to be missed. That said, it does not warrant a long stay. One should set aside a day to two days to wander and see various sites of the city. Most of the treasures that Ethiopia has to offer though lie to the far north and a bit to the south. As I said though, do not disregard Addis' charm."
40,“Volunteered”,Went over here with a charity to help children that were losing their kindergarten... Everyone here was lovely.. Going back next year! Surprisingly good food!
50,“A place to love and to hate”,"Addis Ababa is a vibrant capital of Ethiopia and a combination of everything. There is vibrant night scene, great restaurants, music and art scene but also horrible traffic, pollution and sometimes hasslers... I sometimes say that I hate this city, but most of the times I do have to admit my love for it."
30,“Ancient City”,Spent two nights in the Ethiopian Capital and must say I understand why it's the headquarters of the OAU now AU. The city still maintains its ancient structures though modernization has started creeping in with tall buildings springing up. Can't say there are attractions here anyways. For more fun and attraction take a tour of the country side and visit the city holding the ark.
50,“Recommending Temesgen Bitewlign as an amazing guide in Ethiopia”,"My girlfriend and I just got back from an incredible trip to Ethiopia, and owe it all to Temesgen (Tom) for making it possible. From the second he picked us up at the airport in Addis, we felt at home, and knew were in for an incredible trip. Whether it was seeing historical sites in Ghondar or Aksom or hiking and camping in the Simien mountains, he was an expert and made everything run so smoothly. On a personal note, he's a pleasure to be around, articulate, warm, and engaging, but also knows when to take a step back. He enabled a very authentic experience in Ethiopia all around. Moreover, he was very affordable, trustworthy, and made sure that we were always comfortable with price.Unlike some other African countries I've been to, Ethiopia has so many beautiful sites and a really rich history. Apart from that, the nature and landscapes in the Simien national park was world-class. I thought I was staring at the Grand Canyon. Also, unlike other countries in Africa, it really helped having a guide...I couldn't imagine having organized all the logistics without him.Here's his contact info if you're interested.Email: tomingo123@gmail.comTelephone: +251 9 40323514/+251 912034986Skype: tom.tomingoAnd don't hesitate to contact me if you have any more questions about him or about Ethiopia in general.Thanks!Andrewat1588@hotmail.com"
50,“The most fabulous local guide in addis!”,"Kaleb Teklu is my regular city, discovery and trekking guide from Addis. I am from Europe and have worked with Kaleb for several years. ...he is the best you will find. He has a genuinely big heart and always goes beyond the usual level of help and expertise that you would expect or hope for. He is a font of all knowledge, is able to converse with all levels of clients in fluent English and French, is personable and is a great evening debater. If you want to enjoy his company and make use of his expertise contact him at tourwithkaleb@gmail.com or kalebteklu@yahoo.com"
30,"“This is a tough city, be prepared for brutal traffic, dirt roads, animals in the street and lots of dust”",We flew into Addis and spent a few days there to learn about the country. But it is not a warm and easy city to visit. People are friendly but lots of beggars and not that much to do or see. We loved the country side much more than Addis.
40,“The city”,"City is under a lot of construction, this is a city to watch on the next 5 years. it may be the next hub in Africa.I loved the roads no traffic jams, guess they transport network to be watched in the next few years- the Electric gauge....The taxis are quite old when you see them but inside they are comfy.the weather is very nice during this time, cannot afford to miss day swimming at the Hilton"
40,“A very busy capital”,This city is the capital of Ethiopia and obviously is a bustling city with a major growth in progress. I love people watching while touring other countries and this is a wonderful place to do just that!
30,“a piece of story”,"addis abeba is always full of people, in all the street. You can see churches, monuments and do shopping! What else ?"
30,"“Addis ""under construction"" Ababa”","Hmmm, buildings being built everywhere, roads being built everywhere! Few interesting things to see and do but you may leave with the feeling of why did I bother! Having said that the people were very friendly, hardly any tourists and not much traffic. Goto Tamoca coffee bar in the Piazza, La Mandoline French restaurant in Bole and Entoto Hill, visit the National Museum then head out of town to somewhere more interesting..."
40,“A Bustling City”,"After a week in remote parts of Ethiopia, I enjoy coming to Addis for all it has to offer in the way of restaurants and hotels. It is a crowded city, traffic can be horrendous at peak times, especially with the construction of the light rail system causing lane closures and detours. But it is slowing moving into the 21st century with its redevelopment and construction of new high-rises."
50,“Amazing city”,"All ladies in this city are beautiful - if you are single, perfect place to be (just thinking out loud)People are generally very honest and social - easy to interact with the locals. The food variety perfect especially if you like trying out new things"
50,“Enjoyed my time in Addis”,"I enjoyed my 5 days in Addis. Having read reviews and other articles about Addis Ababa before hand I have to say it was pretty much as I expected it to be. I spent one day walking and riding the little mini buses all over (Had a local person with me, otherwise without know Amharic I don't think one could navigate the buses). Over the 5 days I was there I had people talk to me, smile at me, glare at me, beg from me, fist pump me and ignore me but I never once felt in any danger.It is a very busy place and there is a lot of construction going on. I plan to go again in a year or 2 and venture outside the city some. If you want a fantastic guide that will introduce you to the real Addis Ababa, contact Genet Mengistu ( genetmengistu@yahoo.com ) She was simply the best guide I could imagine."
10,“This city is in the running for my 'Worst city in the World' award.”,"Essentially African in feel, the chaotic streets appeared inviting and exciting. However, the constant hassle from beggars, hawkers, young men shouting ;Hello my friend - give me money' and prostitutes touting for trade, made my stay a particularly unpleasant one. The onslaught was ever-present and these people are quite persistent and not particularly friendly. I for one, will not be returning as there are far more places to go where the visitor is made to feel welcome."
40,"“HArd to describe. Not a beauty, but it has flair”","Its big, but you somehow don't feel it. Tons of people, business, beggars, workers.... messy, but clean (at least where I was roaming around). Old Lada taxis smelling of oil, next to the odd Porsche... (which really seems a bit out of another world). People smile all the time, it feels really nice. Do a little coffee ceremony, that are done all over the place (we went to a little restaurant / bar area not far from Radisson Blu for that, very local style. Great.). It's not a beautiful city, for sure. But it is worth to have a look."
30,“Tight security everywhere you go but beware of the beggars”,"Having never been to Ethiopia, I had no clue what to expect. En route to Tanzania and Rwanda, we decided to stay for a couple of days just to say we've been to Addis Ababa. It's clear the city is trying to become a tourist destination with its western-style hotels, shopping malls, and coffee shops. However, the city does have a long way to go before people will start flocking there with Dollars and Euros to spend. For instance, the taxis are mostly gross and in disrepair, and frankly, there's not much to do....one can go to visit the main local cathedral, but you have to pay to take a photo - even from the outside! We did enjoy visiting the massive local market and my major piece if advice is do not go alone - hire a tour guide or even a taxi driver to take you around. It's not safe and it's so big that it's really easy to get lost. Security is tight - one can't get into a hotel, shop, restaurant, club, etc. without a security screening. Men and women get patted down and purses/bags are examined. Our hotel (and many other places) also had metal detectors and airport style x-ray machines. While this might sound annoying, I actually thought it was great and it made me feel very safe and secure. Unfortunately, walking the streets is a whole other matter.....I was followed by beggars, including children, almost everywhere I went. It was distracting, uncomfortable, and took away some of the city's potential magic. Interestingly, though, begging seems to be illegal as there are cops who will stop them if caught....catching them in the act is, of course, the difficulty.I am happy I went but I think it'll be many, many years before I feel any particular need to go back. Perhaps I'll visit another part of Ethiopia someday....but I think I've seen what there is to see in Addis for now."
50,“Touring Addis Ababa with Temesgen Mengistu (Moses Covenant Tours)”,"Addis Ababa is a bustling city highlighting antiquity while embracing modernity. It is a city of multiple cultural and political layers. Travel guide Temesgen Mengistu, with knowledge and patience revealed all of the layers and nuances of Addis Ababa leaving me with a desire to visit again and again."
40,“Massive Chaotic Capitol City”,"If want quaint, quiet, slightly historical, scrubbed clean, stay in Omaha. Addis heaves with people, small shopkeepers, pickpockets, mad rush of humanity. This city is to be experienced at least once in every life. You'll appreciate your life."
30,“Nothing special to see”,"Addis doesn't offer much to see. All the city center, very tiny actually is under renovation or affected by works in progress to enhance public transportation and the road system.Tragic jam are not exaggerated and the general atmosphere is very quit and calm. I found the city rather clean and the people very friendly. Prices are average. Not worth to organize a trip just to visit Addis, it's a good starting point to visit the north or the south of Ethiopia, an amazing country with plenty of historical and natural resources."
50,“Great place to visit”,This was my first time in Africa and it happened to be here in Addis Ababa the capital of Ethiopia. The people around so friendly and inviting. Though it is a bit congested the scenery and weather are amazing I suggest everyone visit at least once in life
50,“Meskel”,"Addis doesn't have a great deal to recommend it other than the Ethnology Museum (a model of Lucy and all her skeletal friends), St George's Cathedral and a few other museums. The market is ok if you like crowds, noise and unpleasant smells. However, a recent vsit coincided with the celebration of Meskel, the discovery of the true cross. This is unique spectacle that occurs once a year and is an incredible experience, even for old atheists like me.Got to be seen to be believed, so go and see it! Three stars for Addis - an extra two for Mesekel"
30,“Visited this City during Transit”,"Visited this City during Transit... Government need to do a lot to make this a World Class City. And if Government do so, then it can boost country's economy, as it can become a Business Hub for Africa. Business People around the world can come to Addis Ababa and they can meet other African Countries Business Representatives. This is the demand. Business people around the world will love to visit one city to cover whole Africa. Throughout the year government can ask its business houses to run different category exhibitions."
50,“Mesmerizing Climate...”,One of the fev. places I have been to... the first thing u notice abt. this place is it's Mesmerizing climate... climate was so well chilling and the place was so damn beautiful.. plus the girls of Addis r super amazing ;)
40,“Happy new years for Ethiopia”,"What can I say, I arrived on the eve of the traditional new years for Habasha- everything was alive, and streets crowded- Celebration in the air- this is the best time to visit the country, everybody is friendly, and many traditionals food to try, chickens tibs, lamb tibs, door wet, dabu- you must try it all- I stayed at Concord hotel on Lancha road, there is a club inside, the festivals was amazing, there was dancers performing- the 3 best areas in Addis is Bole road, Lancha road, and Jergi road- always vibrant- try something different, come visit the African country curing New Years- u will love it"
20,“Rugged and Dusty”,"Will not come back to this place anytime soon, but I will give you tips about the place based on my experience.1. If you could arrange the whole travel in Ethiopia with a travel agent or group, do it!2. If you can rent car to get around, do it!3. Time in Ethiopia is entirely different with the rest of world which start the 00:00 at midnight, theirs is at 06:00. So when they speak of Ethiopian local time of 10:00, they meant 16:00. Confuse? I was too, and cost me a day missed for the bus!4. A lot of opportunists in there since all the busses and transport are only written in their language not Germanic. So basically you are a fool in here. Trust no one except the people from your hotel.5. Food is amazing in here, no matter where. Don't be scared to try.6. Try the local honey based fermented alcohol called Tej7. Blue Nile waterfall is breath taking. Go and see it in Bahr Dir. Be cautious about the opportunists and local bus. Just hire a car and driver to take you there. The bit more of cost worth more than the head ache trying to get around yourself.8. Avoid the inter city bus like Salam bus or the other one which I forgot what's called. We took the bus to go from Addis to Bahr Dir. Nightmare! Bus is dirty, cockroach was seen, they play local song continuously until you want to explode your head, the journey is literally 11 hours, with one stop for lunch in a cafeteria and two ""bush toilet"" stops in between. Long story short we took the plane back to Addis.9. Nothing much in Addis... Just dusty."
50,"“Excellent local guide, highly recommended”","My husband and I spent 5 days in Addis Ababa (first time here). On our first day, we randomly met a local rasta, Addis, in the Piazza downtown. He seemed sincere, very friendly, knowledgable, and speaks very good English. We agreed to have him as our guide.Our full day with him included an 8am pickup at our hotel, then he showed us all the main sites in Addis, including the Merkato, the National and Ethnoculture Museums, Entoto Mountain, all the main churches, and we ate at the oldest restaurant in Addis (he introduced us to local foods). I would highly recommend going to the Merkato, but with a guide. This place is very overwhelming and is mostly for locals (during our 2 hours there, we never saw any other tourists). Addis was great at the market making sure we were safe and explained the various vendors.He also offers multi day trips to see traditional tribes, but we didn't have enough time to do it on this trip.I would highly recommend Addis as your guide!His contact info is:Local phone number: 0910034256, International number: 251910034256Email: addisrasta@gmail.comHe doesn't have a website as he works for a local tour company. His rates were very fare."
30,“Just enough to see in one day”,"Travelled to Addis Ababa on a layover and hired a private guide and driver to show us around for the day. Having never been to Africa before, Addis was certainly a new experience. For a city of 3 million people it seems much smaller. There are a number of worthwhile museums to visit and beautiful churches to see. The items in the museums are not all well-preserved, and often cost 50-100Birr/person to visit. The museums do however provide an excellent sketch of Ethiopian history, both ancient and modern. Restaurants are plentiful and both Ethiopian and Western food is available. The city presents a dichotomy between the extremely poor - with many women and children begging, and the middle-class & wealthy - socializing in restaurants and coffee shops. For both safety and logistical reasons, the international traveler should hire a guide to tour them around, as petty-crime can be a problem, and the language barrier is very evident. Notably lacking in Addis Ababa on my short visit were walkable neighbourhoods to wonder through - the city has notable destinations to visit but little outside that to discover - which is why I gave it 3 stars."
50,“My life in Addis Abeba”,"I spent in Addis Abeba about two years within the years of 1986-1987. This city is really a beautiful flower, as it is translated from Amharic. I liked all areas I lived or just visited - Piassa street, markato, Bole, Kasanches, Arat Kilo and plenty of others. I liked local people some of which became my true friends, I liked local food (tibs, doro wott and injera), and of course Ethiopian coffee. In general, I liked everything, even Ethiopian calendar and the tourism company motto ""Thirteen months of sunshine."" I wish I could come there again, though my situation does not permit me to do this, to realize my dream and meet my friends and visit places of interest there."
50,“Journalist from Radio Afrika Tv Vienna”,"Nice and very nice with expiriance one guide tour Samri best guide tourist in Ethiopia, big respect! I will come again to know more about Ethiopia with here."
30,"“""Good city with several flaws""”",Good place to visit...nice historical sites...transport is extremely expensive....don't pay more than 100 to 150birr within town..Be careful with pick pockets...especially the cute looking kids that come in a friendly manner tapping you and in the process nick your belongings especially phones...Tour guides and taxis are also over zealous and try to make the most out of unsuspecting tourists...One time visit destination. ..
10,“Worst place on earth”,"The people are very unfriendly, and dont speak any english, even though it is listed as 1 of 2 official languages.The locals beg when they see foreigners, and try to take advantage and overcharge.Crime is rife, as is corruption.There is nothing to see for tourists, spend max 1 day here."
30,“Not my favorite city”,"I am glad I went. But, other than transiting to other parts of Ethiopia, which is definitely high on my radar, I would not return. The arrival airport terminal was a disaster. The city is somewhat clean, but seems to have hundreds of building projects started but not being worked. The people I met were charming and nice. But, there wasn't much in the way of modern shopping. Overall, unless you stay at the $400+ per night Sheraton, the city lacks any kind of modern or even charming districts. I did like the B&B I stayed at, Jazly. And we had a nice dinner out. But, not a city worth much after one day."
30,"“Rich history, but a hard place to visit”","I was quite thrilled to visit Addis because of its rich history and culture. In hindsight, I wish I'd done a great deal differently to have enjoyed it more. Looking back, this is the sort of trip that would have benefited from more research beforehand. We were ignorant of cab fare costs (were conned into $60USD for a 15min ride), expected tour guides to be available at historic sites (they were not) and were guided to very touristy restaurants at the recommendation of our hotel. The most disappointing was that the sites are so unprotected. Except for the glass case which contains it, Lucy has no security. The same is true for many of the other artifacts in the National Museum.Still, the food was phenomenal, the coffee was unbeatable and the shopping was fun. Worth a couple days on your itinerary."
40,"“Didn't see many sites, but the hospitality was great”","We stayed with good friends and loved every minute of being in Addis. Wonderful people, delicious (spicy!) food, good coffee, mild climate... I just wish we'd had more time to explore."
40,“Trip to Addis”,"Starting from visa on arrival to flying out of Addis it was pleasant experience, visa not very expensive ($20) , hotels in the range of $60 onwards in a good location ( Bole road), people very pleasant and feel very strongly towards their country, every small retailer gives you a bill for goods purchased , I had booked for city tour through abeba tours, a travel agency whose guide Mr.Milaku who was very knowledgeable about the city including dates and the chauffer mohammed very young with lot of patience. The city tour took the whole day , merkato can be given a miss as its similar to any country market, but visit Tomoca, for good Ethiopian coffee and one of the cultural restaurants for good cultural show and Ethiopian food. Outside Addis same day return can be planned to the Debre Libanos monasteries and the Portuguese bridge( fake Nile river gorge as it a tributary to Nile river, the actual gorge is good 4 hours drive one way from Addis ) we have very good sights and birds here and we can also come close to some baboons in natural habitation.I was taken on this trip by Abbey and Anton from Awaze tours, both were very informative and very patient and ready to tell you all information, Addis has a mad night life till 6am in the morning. The cabs are expensive as anything within 3 km return trip would cost Birr300( birr 20= $1). Climate overall very cool in Addis, need to wear light woolens in the night. Lot more to see north and south Ethiopia , maybe another trip will happen for this. I did not come across any corruption or police harassment for money like in many African oil countries.felt very safe."
40,“Visit to addis”,"Right from my landing , visa on arrival, interaction with unknown people seeking help at the airport ( as all of them don't speak English) , it was a very pleasant experience. I found the people warm, friendly, vibrant with energy and very proud of their country with zero tolerance to corruption. Had time only to go through local sights within Addis on day 1, Abeba tours took good care to ensure I did not miss any sight, the boys Mohammed who was a very young guy who was driving me around and Milaku another young lad with surprisingly good knowledge of Ethiopia and its history with dates. The tour company was very professional. Day 2, I had booked for another tour operator to take me outside Addis city limits to nearby sight seeing locations, the tour operator was Awaze tours , accompanied by Anton the person who drove us around and Abay, the guide, again the guide knowledge and love for the country is worth appreciating, I was taken on a trip to the Orthodox church monastery at Debre Libanos (hope I got the spelling right) and Portuguese bridge , which they call as blue Nile gorge(fake blue Nile gorge), which is around 2 hours one way from Addis ( Actual blue Nile gorge which is difficult for a day trip as it is around 5 hrs trip one way) . it was a good experience , the drive , the sights and the the mountain and gorge view( gorge of a tributary to Nile). There are amazing cultural restaurants around in Addis which give you the experience of local food and dance , songs , musical instrument. The night life is very good with very good clubs , the city is absolutely different to all cities in Africa I have visited, did not come across any corruption or police harassment. Overall a good place to visit. I would look forward to another trip to go to the real Nile gorge and beautiful locations in north and south Ethiopia."
50,“Taitu Hotel”,"I loved Addis Ababa, having spent time in several African Countries, I found Addis clean and friendly. OK beware of pick pockets, they will try and befriend you to get close, but just be sensible and alert as anywhere. The vehicles are clean no massively polluting trucks and buses. They even have a mono rail under construction. Many new buildings rising out of the ground, a sign of development. So I went to the Taitu Hotel one Sunday evening for the Jazz and it was just great!! The hotel is an experience in its self, with a small exhibition upstairs some restaurant and bars. Had some good food at a good price. Ethiopia has its own blend of Jazz and its easy to get lost in it. A highly recommended City and good Jazz venues. I stayed at the Empire Hotel also reviewed on here."
40,“Great city if you are open-minded”,"Addis is a bustling city with some great restaurants, hotels and places to shop. Be sure to leave with some silver, coffee and local artwork. I found the people pleasant and warm. Driving is not recommended so please book a driver or take public transportation. We want to go back someday and if you want to see a busy African city you should stop for at least a couple nights before journeying onward."
40,“A Busy Yet Quiet City”,"I was surprised at how quiet the people and the city is despite it being very busy. Tourists do need to be vigilant to avoid pick pockets, as you would in any city, there are also a lot of beggars in certain places but otherwise the place seems very peaceful and safe to walk around and explore. All the Ethiopians I came across were friendly."
30,"“Fly in, drive out”","Addis Ababa is just a city, and nothing like the rest of Ethiopia. Cars everywhere, seemingly wealthy young men all driving said cars, nothing appealing at all. Do not plan on spending too much time here when planning your itinerary."
30,“Good gateway”,"Big town, a lot of smog and pollution, traffic make it difficult to breathe, homeless/poor people begging in streets, few museum and attractions. Probably a good gateway to get around other destinations of Ethiopia."
50,“BEAUTIFUL ETHIOPIA”,"We recently visited the cultural tour in Ethiopia and was amazed at the wonders this country holds.We traveled with three other couples and by chance through Trip Advisor found the most amazing tour agency in Ethiopia.It is Bluesky Ethiopia tours in Addis Ababa.The head of the agency Yared wasefficient,prompt to our communication.The tour was well planned and the most economic from other agencies we asked.Yes Ethiopia has a long way to go in terms of tourism,but look at how far it came in the longrun.Thanks to all the beautiful Ethiopian people for with their smile made our visit unforgetable.AretoulaP. Athens,Greece"
40,“Be prepared!”,"I was born in the US (parents from Ethiopia) and to travel in and out of Addis was a bit of a culture shock even for me. If you cannot speak Amharic I highly suggest hiring a tour guide or someone to help you manage your trip. Many people can speak English, but it's best you do what you can to immerse yourself into the culture and hearing the language spoken in its origin country. CARRY/ORDER BOTTLE WATER or ""Ambo"" (Sparkling) water WITH YOU EVERY WHERE YOU GO. Also, pack extra wipes. The sun is nice and bright so be sure to have sunglasses before you go. For people who are foreign to Ethiopia I will say it is a beautiful country with the kindest people you will ever meet, but that doesnt mean you shouldn't be cautious with your possessions. Absolutely you should. Try to stay for at least month and visit other cities in Ethiopia. You will surely enjoy your stay!"
10,“A hole”,"Dirty, dusty, not much really of any merit apart from a few good restaurants. Leave ASAP and go to the smaller towns."
20,“Skip it and go to the countryside!”,"Addis Ababa is not exactly a nice city to wander around. Streets are dirty, hot and unsafe. You should take good care with pickpockets and scammers. We couldn't find many places of interest there. Trinity Cathedral is a beautiful church, and we were happy to witness an Epiphany festivity taking place there, in other churches and on the streets. Apart from that, perhaps Lucy (a 3.2-million-year hominid skeleton) would attract your attention. It's displayed at the National Museum of Ethiopia, at a walking distance from the Trinity Cathedral. But attention: only a replica is on display! Unfortunately museums in Ethiopia are not very well kept... Right beside the museum there's a cozy place to have lunch: Lucy Gazebo. In fact, you'll get a much better feeling of Ethiopia if you visit smaller towns and the countryside."
40,“Visiting Addis Ababa Ethiopia”,"The city has a lot to offer the visitor. Great restaurants with ever better prices. Be careful as some of the Indian restaurants are way over priced compared to places like the Rodeo. The fresh fruit stands all have cheap prices and organic delicious tasting fruit. The traffic is rather thick between 7:30 AM to 9:30 AM. Then around 11:30 AM it thickens up again. Around 1:30 it thins out a tad but around 4 PM it gets bad again and the smog is rather thick most days. Movies are $2 at the box office. Everybody is especially friendly and you have no fear of thieves or danger in Ethiopia. There traditional restaurants (Yod Abbisinia) have great shows in the evening. With music and dancing. The food is some of the best I have tasted. Injera even is not so bad when mixed with spicy meat, usually chicken or been but lamb is also eaten a lot there. You'll have no problems in Ethiopia except for the traffic during busy times. Shopping the stadium shops is 20% cheaper than around Bole. The ice cream is extra creamy are natural. Go for the food and the people. You won't be disappointed."
30,“Controlled chaos”,"Ethiopia is a wonderful country to visit, it is a pity that Addis Ababa is such an unattractive city because of poverty and poor city planning. That being said, if you find yourself there for a day or two there is plenty to do and see."
50,“Favorite”,By so far the most favorite city of mine. You will find a mix of history and friendly people.Life is cheap compared even to cities like Nairobi and Djibouti.Definitely i will visit the city again.
50,“WOW”,What a great City so much to see and do. You will need a guide that is for sure the driving here is crazy and no street sign names. Have the hotels and restaurants them negotiate your Taxi ride.
10,“Boston Day Spa - when you have too much money and very low expectations”,"I DO NOT recommend Boston Spa anymore! I used to go there regularly before but now I am full-on boycotting it. The prices are constantly going up and the quality of both the spa services themselves and the customer service at the front desk in steadily deteriorating.By now, 80% of the pedicure massaging chairs no longer work (and some of them are stuck so that the little balls protrude from the chair, so it's really uncomfortable to sit in them) and they no longer disinfect the pedicure/manicure tools after each customer. 3/5 of the masseuses have no idea where your muscles are or how to give a Swedish massage without hurting/scratching you. The waxing is hasty and imprecise (you feel as if they will shout ""next!"" right at the end of your appointment). And worst of all, they constantly make mistakes in appointments - they forget them, schedule you for the wrong day/time/service and even if they get the appointment right, they make you wait without an explanation for 15-20 minutes past your scheduled time almost every time you go there.And if you ever try to complain or kindly suggest improvements to the front desk staff, they simply ignore it and proceed to charging you for the services. I am extremely taken aback by the repeated bad experience at Boston Spa and recommend you look for a different place - unless you like paying Western prices for sub-standard services."
20,“Terrible roads and impossible to get around the city.”,"Addis is the capital of Africa with the headquarters of the African Union based there. It is relatively new being about 125 years old. While Ethiopia has so much to offer, Addis is a nightmare with awful roads and traffic jams everywhere. This is the case even though there has been a massive increase in expenditureon the roads in the last five to ten years. The city engineers seem more interested in building new roads while the old ones go to ruin. For example traveling from the Bole Road to the old airport is nothing short of a disaster. One passes Kairra and then on to Torhailleoch where traveling just 500 metres can take an hour. Traffic management is very important where so many diversions take place because of the road construction."
20,"“The Heart of an ancient nation, but a weak one with clogged arteries”","Addis Ababa meaning New Flower is just over one hundred years old and the capital of one of the oldest nations in the world. With a written history going back some three thousand years and the only country in Africa which was not colonized, Ethiopia has much to offer to visitors looking for something different.However the city is going through considerable change with a construction boom and major investment in the road system. The rainy season plays havoc with the roads, even those which have been recently completed with pot holes covered in water caused by drainage. problems. The result is traffic at a standstill as drivers try to navigate around the pot holes to avoid damaging their cars. A particular example is the road from Bole to the Old Airport area, a journey which should take thirty minutes can now be one of up to 90 minutes. When one reaches the roundabout at Tourhailoch which has been recently constructed the journey becomes a nightmare with bumper to bumper vehicles moving at the speed of a snail. Unfortunately there are many examples like this made worse by the huge road constructions projects still underway.The city is also plagued by professional beggars who work at each and every traffic light and prostitution which is a characteristic of the city including areas such as Bole Road which is the main road from the airport to the city center.Hotels are still very basic with few of a high quality .The government seems more interested in facilities rather than the quality of service being provided. There is a clear need for quality hotel training institutions which are at an international standard so that the necessary quality staff are available for the hotel sector.Having said that Addis Ababa is the gateway to a great country with loads to offer."
40,“Exotic and ancient culture of magnificent Addis Abba”,"Wonderful adventure town where you can see Lucy and all the country's traditional treasures as well as eat delicious local cuisine at the Lucy Museum restaurant. Then go on campus at nearby University of Addis Ababa which used to be Emperor Haille Selasse's royal palace. Sit in his throne. See his luxurious bedroom chamber. Buy cheap good quality souvenirs of art, posters and folk wares. Move on to the National Archives and Library which also have a great lunch restaurant. Research, read or just peruse the archives and stacks and exhibits. So much to do in the city as you go to Culture 2000 or Crown Hotel for traditional music, dances, songs, clothing and food a lacarte or buffet. At Friendship you can shop or go to Boston Spa or Limetree for meals and free wifi. Enjoy!"
50,“High Altitude”,An awesome place to visit around Christmas and Epiphany feasts and of course go around Entoto Mountains and eat meat with ingera in the small butchery places !I love this Mountain..
30,"“Busy city, but moving forward”","I traveled around Ethiopia a bit before i came to Addis Ababa. Having been to poor African countries before i was prepared for lots of poverty, disease and dirt as well as getting mugged or hassled. To my surprise it was not as bad in Addis Ababa as i had feared, however you should be aware of the fact that you are a stranger in a strangs land, in a harsh city where life is hard.Other than that, the people are friendly, almost everybody speaks English and although things a are a lot more expensive than outside the city, you can still have an affordable stay here. Make sure to negotiate prices whenever you take a taxi or get your shoes cleaned :-)If you are short on time, you can ask a taxi driver to take you around the city sights, the palaces and to museums. Our fist cab driver drove us around for 300 bir (say 12 euros) for the whole afternoon and was very knowledgeable and proud of his city.The air quality to me was pretty bad, mostly caused by old smelly cars and buses. Also, make sure to wear comfortable walking shoes as most streets have holes in them and in the rainy season there will be mud and water everywhere.Here's the hard part. Whenever you ride around in a taxi, poor people will come up to the window and beg for money. It is illegal to give them anything. This can be heartbreaking as you do see cases of leprosy, hunger or other hardship that us westerners are not necessarily used to. Instead of handing out cash, i brought a bunch of clothes that i no longer needed and gave them away to people that i had 'business' with, such as shoe cleaners or hotel staff and students.Don't get intimidated by crowds of youngsters and let yourself be amazed and you will see the beauty of this busy hard city."
30,“Expensive city with nice people”,"Before Addis we took a roundtrip in the North of Etiopia, and returning to a big city was less satisfying than expected. Addis is expensive, (esp. taxis), lots of polution, and for the first time we were exposed to street children who tried to snatch Money from our pockets, ( in the case of streetchildren, just don't let them come close to you, it can be unpleasant to shout at them, but that's what you should do, and let them know that you are aware of them. keep nothing in your pockets) However, the etiopians were as everywhere else in the country very nice and welcoming people, that you gotta love. And we felt very safe in the city. The best and cheapest tourist shop(fixed prices, one third of the prices in other shops) we found in Churcill Ave. across from the 21st Building."
30,“Addis Ababa”,"Addis Ababa translated literally new flower was founded a little more than a century ago during the days of King Menelik the second the hero of the Battle of Adowa. Today the city is busy and peopled by more than 85 million people and the seat of AU,ECA , many Embassies and organizations. Its museums, standing monuments, Avenues, cultural centers, open markets are some of its sights of interest for travelers to Ethiopia"
20,“Poor city with few intersesting tings”,I took a cab and asked the driver for a city highlight tour. Few monuments can be seen which mostly represent previous fights and victories. I found the national museum and the lion zoo historically interesting.Streets and Merkato were not appealing.
50,“Wenchi Crater Lake - Ethiopia - like walk thru a national geographic story”,"Two years ago while on a Medical Mission from Canada to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia - a group of us took a guided Day Tour to Wenchi Crater Lake - about 3 hr trip beautiful paved road most of the way then gravel at the end. This was definitely the highlite of my trip to Ethiopia.... after spending two weeks in the big city it was so serene to walk and ride horses down the trails to the lake at the bottom of the Crater. It was quiet, peaceful, serene... I could go on and on... looking around seeing the village people who quietly came out to greet us as we road or walked by. It was pure magic to take a peek into their lives! Each direction you looked you saw their huts tucked into the hillside... and children peeking out from perches along the ridges of the hillside as well. Beautiful.. we rode horseback down and back up but it wasn't rushed so much time to just look around as we rode!take your own food and water.. I know we stopped at a town near here (Ambo I believe) to use washrooms etc before finishing the last leg of the trip to the Crater. ps In Ambo, like the rest of Ethiopia there a great cup of coffee!!"
40,“Beautiful town”,"Two most important lines/route in Addis is from Bole Airport upto Shiro meda and From Le Gehar train station upto Addis Abeba City council or Piassa. From train station upto piassa you can witness the old buildings, theaters, film and business are all gathered on this line. In old days this is a trade line and in short this was the center of the city. Whenever you go through this street it reminds you of an old Addis Abeba, and it gives you especial feeling. The other line belongs to noble men/women. On this street you witness the palaces, churches, education centers and institute, five star hotels, museums and publication houses. In short this is the brain line of the country. Then you go to Merkato, where everything and anything that entered the area can be sold, including human-being."
40,“Modernizing yet keeping the indigenous”,"The city is expanding, modernizing yet keeping the indigenous. Side road fruit stands are an icon in the city, excellent place to pickup local fruits and have short conversations. You can see the rapid development from all constructions everywhere. Addis Ababa is high altitude, has excellent weather year round, smiling friendly locals, and many interesting corners to discover."
50,"“exciting city, beautiful country, lovely people, great food”","People are really specially nice in this city. I was in love with the cuisine. yes, it is a poor country with lots of poverty and thus lots of filth and disturbing garbage all around the city; but walking even in the slums is relatively safe as compared to other parts of the world - that I really appreciated because I love watching how the average people live. It is nice to experience the hustle and bustle of this city, its dynamic development, the happy people despite the poverty. The cuisine is great.It is also fantastic to visit Lucy in person - the oldest of us!The only thing you should be very very careful of - food poisoning or other similar traveller's diseases are very common and difficult to prevent. More than half of our UN group (of over 100) got sick one way or another during the 8 days of our meetings, without respect to where they came from. Be very maticulously picky with what you eat, drink and touchI would have loved to have more time in this fantastic city and country."
40,“What's doing in Addis?”,"Not much to do here; I think you need to get out of Addis to see what Ethiopia is about. Don't stay more than one day here--a full day, but no more. To see more, you need a driver who can take care of you. You must visit the Churches in the north and the Ark of the Covenant."
30,“Interesting”,You need a tour guide here or know someone local to pick you up and navigate out of the airport and driving through the city. There is so much to see in the city - traffic is hectic - very crowded with pedestrians.
40,“nice sportive people”,everyday when I wake up and look through the window of my room at the Sheraton I noticed that many people are practicing and juging ... Great People deserve to win the olimpics
50,"“A modern, fascinating city”","We loved Addis Ababa. Don't listen to the naysayers: if you don't spend a little time in Addis, you will miss out. I spent three days in the city. I hired a car tour with Alex: he did a great job organizing everything and making sure I saw the most interesting sites. One day we went up the Entoto mountains above the city which are cool and covered in pines. In addition to the best views, there is a lovely old church and Emperor Menelik II's old palace. (Which is quite humble, actually. Makes you think that had Haile Salassie stayed there, instead of building ever grander palaces while his people starved, Ethiopia might still be under the rule of his family.) We also went the Mercato Market, Africa's largest, the Red Terror Museum, The Anthropological Museum at the University, and the National Museum. Don't miss a night out listening to Ethiopian Traditional Music and a great meal!We arranged our tours in Ethiopia (Axum, Lalibela, and Addis Ababa) with Alex (alebachew ababe). www.simienmountains.com Mob.+251 911 90 47 92alebachew_2005 at yahoo dot com. He made sure we had a great vacation. All of the guides met us at the hotel and arranged cars when necessary. They were all excellent and helpful. And the prices were very reasonable. Don't forget to tip the guides. If they are good a 30% tip is appropriate."
50,“A place you'll never forget”,"Addis Ababa is the capital of Ethiopia. And I must say, out of all the places i've been to, Addis Ababa captures a beautiful scenery than any place i've ever been to, there is so much to do in that city. Having a driver in Addis Ababa while visiting would be great and very useful. There is so much culture shown everywhere. The people are highly respectful, funny, and show kindness. Unfortunately, I didn't have enough time to see all the things I wish I could of seen. Addis Ababa is big and beautiful. I would bring a good quality camera because a camera captures beautiful moment, and definitely walking shoes, sandals are okay too, but it depends on where you are going to. Be extra careful with your valuable things you carry around in public."
20,“Interesting City”,"If you like Ethiopian food and coffee, you may like Addis for a couple days. They even have surprisingly good pizza and pasta in the old Piazza section of the city. Careful with your belongings, and with overly friendly people who ""just want to help you out."" You'll have to haggle for just about everything and make sure you don't get swindled.The city and country are in poor shape and the economic condition is making crooks out of people. I hope the situation changes for the better."
20,“Leave Addis and explore the delights the rest of Ethiopia has to offer”,"Addis Ababa is a village in a city - it's dirty, unfriendly and a little scary. Our best advice would be to leave Addis as soon as possible and explore the other amazing cities across Ethiopia - you can hardly believe that you are in the same country when you visit Bahir Dar, Gondar and Lalibela!"
20,“Good for a day...”,"Not much to do in this town with the exception of a couple of decent museums. Other than that, not much. Serious traffic issues and smog makes for miserable getting around"
50,“Lucy is back!!”,"Lucy is back in ADD, after 5 years of absence!! A world event, albeit on small scale. We went to see her, of course at the National Museum in Addis Ababa. It was a special moment. She looked good, despite her ripe old age (3.18 million years). Happy to share a photo, to give you an idea. It's not a very good one, I am afraid, as she's in a sealed glass case. In case you wonder, Lucy is believed to be one of our oldest human ancestors. Her scientific name is Australopithecus Afarensi. She was found in 1974 in Hadar in the Afar depression in Eastern part of Ethiopia. Lucy was called Lucy because the archaeologist in question was listening to the Beatles' song ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"". Such is life!"
50,“a nice inexpensive getaway”,"you cant go wrong with visiting Addis Ababa- the food and culture is great, many things to do, nice clubs and restaurant, Bole Road is under construction now, so there are limits to entertainment, but if u dont mind walking, then there is no limit to things to do. $100 usa dollars can go a long way. thats 1850 big in ethiopian money- it will last u 5 days if u spend it on food and taxi, and clubs- im sure of it, your money goes a long way in ethiopia- try a traditional dish called Tibs, you will not regret it, make sure you visit a night club called Illusions, you will not regret it- club platinum use to be the place to go, now many teenagers and young folks go there, so be aware of that. keep in mind, very IMPORTANT, you can not leave the country with Ethiopian money- make sure u spend it all, or take it to currency exchange, or give it away, if you get caught with some of it, you can be imprisoned. its cool to enter the country with it, but not exit the country with it.- i had a blast, the weathr is always between 60 to 80 degrees every single day, no need for air conditions and heat system. there are cons artist all around, so dont talk to male strangers, unless its to say hi and bye! be very careful, i had to learn the hard way, they tried me twice! i was already informed of these tactics, so their plan didnt work on me"
20,“Non touristy”,"Nothing went wrong. Just did not find the place interesting. Was very difficult to try and organise a day tour. Just a place like any where else.Keep alert, as kids like to hassels you and next they are trying to pickpocket."
30,“A city alive”,"Fourth visit as stop over and it is certanily a city to stimulate. My eyes were in overdrive for the first day or so, but you soon settle into the tempo.Perhaps most striking is the socio economic divide between those who have and those who have not, quite depressing actually. No more apparent than when wandering past the Sheradon hotel, swamped in palm trees, lines of vintage bentleys and the 'Haves' appearing to be oblivious of the have nots, the Hotel is literally surrounded by abject poverty, such a sad statement in many respects. anyway, the people we met etc were very friendly and helpful.You will be offered trinkets to buy every 10 yards or so, but just refuse politely and keep moving. Careful crossing the roads as the traffic is non stop and the emissions can be overpowering, but not uncommon in a developing city.A super range of shops and 'things to see', but for the most part, take time to sit and watch this facinating place and is people.Be aware of taxi's, ensure you use the state regulated companies, who have a clip board of destination prices which you can view, otherwise you are likely to be taken advantage of by some of the more unscroupulousOverall as a stop over Addis is fine but not a place for extended periods of time."
40,“Rich Cultural Experience”,"I've had the opportunity to travel to Addis Ababa twice; Sept. 1999 and Jan. 2013. After my first visit, I yearned to go back because I was so impressed about the rich and proud culture of the people (who by the way are very beautiful!). Addis is not the place to travel for those looking for Haute Couture, Eurocentric lifestyles or well-developed roads. While there, the focus should be on experiencing good food, nightlife, socializing, shopping and visiting the main attractions including the museum, mercado, zoo, Piazza, and even the Sheraton and Radisson Blu. It's best to befriend a trusting Addis native (some are eager to assist for some small exchange of goods) as to avoid price haggling. If you don't speak Amharic, expect to be haggled and treated indifferently, as many assume that foreigners ""ferengy"" (pronounced for-in-gay) are wealthy, arrogant, ethnocentric and have a sense of entitlement..many will seek to exploit this. This is my only criticism."
50,“Sunny Addis”,"We did not know what to expect on our first trip to Addis. We knew it would be big, but we were definitely surprised by its mix of old and new. Large hotels and businesses are surrounded by shanties and animals and people are everywhere - including the middle of the streets! We will be going back in just a couple of months on our 6th trip! Addis is in our blood now (or maybe it's just the dust! LOL!)"
30,“city proper”,exploring the city by foot was very nice but be careful with those young kids they will try to attract your attention while walking BUT be vigilant with your bag!
30,"“African City, nothing special!”","Be careful when visiting Addis Abeba. There are many people lurking around who try to get your money. Although we did not have the feeling that it was dangerous there, some people tried to sell totally overpriced phone cards or skins of wild cats etc. (which is not allowed at all) and thinks like this. However, there are also many very friendly people. The slums are mixed with the normal city houses. The national museum is okay but not really a museum at all from a European perspective. The university and the cultural museum are nice."
30,“Not much to see”,We drove around taking care of some errands before heading out to trek - there's not much to see or do - very simple town - if you are coming to ethiopia I suggest spending as little time in Addis as possible - use your time to see the north
40,“New Bloem Ethiopia Tour”,"Sammy and Barack organise some beautiful tours, starting from Addis Abeba. Personally, I joined the tour to the Wenchi Crater Lake and the Portugese Bridge. Both were well organised and really enjoyable."
50,“Amazing Ethiopia Tours”,"Highly recommend this tour agency if you are looking to book a trip in Ethiopia. Simeneh is extremely professional and helpful. Simeneh can tailor any trip you need for any budget. As an avid backpacker for over 20 years, I am use to traveling independently. However the only way to see Ethiopia is by organized tour. Our 15 day trip of both the North and South was nothing short of exceptional. All of our drivers were outstanding, the cars were of good quality and our guides spoke excellent English. In Omo valley we had Halieab as our guide and Mike as our driver. They truly made our trip a trip of a lifetime."
30,“A bustling African city but not too much to experience!”,"Being the 3rd highest capital in the world (2400meters), the weather is Addis is rather good (when not in the rainy season) and not too hot. Like any big city of any developing country, it is rather polluted but hectic and full of life. You always see people active and with a will to get the best of their day (which terribly lacks now is some european countries I find). The city itself seemed rather safe and we never particularly worried when walking in the streets (some are to be avoided at night though). We were aware of ""plonkers"" but none really showed up during our stay.There is no much to do in the city but you can pay a visit to the mercato (the main market of the city). Not much farenji (white people) here but with a good guide we saw some nice spots with spices, food, clothes.If you are fed up with the city, it is nice to go to Entoto which is like a haven where one can enjoy a nice walk.All in all, one day in Addis is probably well enough to get a good glimpse of it."
50,“Amazing Ethiopia Tours”,"Just finished another 15 day tour to the North and South of Ethiopia with Amazing Ethiopia tours and want to share the experience...I got to know Simeneh, the owner of Amazing Ethiopia tours, during my third visit to Ethiopia back in 2008. I work as a tour guide and was searching for a reliable tour operator in Ethiopia. I have probably contacted every possible tour operator, but non of them was as helpful and responsive as Simeneh. From the initial contact, through the whole trip planning process, to the tours itself, everything is always highly professional and first class in every aspect. Until now i have done basically every part of Ethiopia with him, all together 16 tours. Have been to north, south, east, west, Danakil,... Always with good experienced guides, excellent drivers and excellent service.All in all i can only recommend them and for sure will use their service in the future."
40,“Crowded and full of contradictions”,"If you are travelling around Ethiopia, for sure you don't want to miss Addis Ababa, its capital city, but be prepared for what you are going to see.The first impression I got upon arriving was that this is a terribly crowded city—it seems that simply everyone is out on the street. At first it was shocking for me that, unlike for instance in most european cities, everybody is sort of 'mixed up', meaning that you will probably see a guy selling (for instance) underwear next to a begging woman with 4 children, next to some completely normal teenagers chatting on their way back from school and then an extremely 'flashy' lady walking by and showing off her recently purchased handbag.Most areas, being honest, are simply huge slums and, here and there, some new, flashy skyscrapers show the urge for growing and developing that the richer people in the country have. I normally enjoy visiting places on foot and 'investigating' all areas, but actually this is not the kind of city where you can simply go for a pleasant walk and, for once, I was happy I rented a van and a guide to do a city tour.It is perfectly OK to visit the city on your own though, but I would advise anyway to have a local guide to go with you—they'll not only show you what's more important to see, but they'll also help you, for instance, to bargain in case you want to buy something and to avoid being scammed.Now, if you are white, be very prepared to attract everyone's attention. Some people will ignore you, but some will shout 'faranji' at you for no other reason than being indeed a faranji, a white foreigner; normally they are just pointing out this obvious fact and it is not any kind of threat or anything, they'll just walk by and that was it.Of course every beggar will want money from you and small children will start following you the moment they see you with the hope of getting some treat (it's recommended not to give them anything though). Don't be surprised either if some random person (not necessarily a beggar) comes up to you and simply says something like ""Give me 100 birr""—not aggressive, not threatening, not trying to rob you, they are just asking for money because you are white and they expect white people to be rich and to simply go around giving money away, so they try to get some (and I'm sure they get something more than once).You must of course be careful and aware of robbers, because in some areas, specially crowded ones like the Mecato, it's not difficult to get robbed (I was luckily not and I must add I didn't feel threatened at any moment).There are several interesting areas to visit (don't miss the Entoto Hill or the Mercato), markets to go shopping for local souvenirs (be prepared to bargain) and, of course, loads of restaurants where you can eat a delicious ethiopian meal or a more 'regular faranji meal' (be careful of course with where and what you eat and drink).Visiting this city is really a good experience and highly recommended to learn about Ethiopia and its many contradictions."
20,“Overall not pleasant”,"Overall not a pleasant city and one to avoid unless travelling through or on business. The city is crowded, taxi's and hotels are extremely over priced. The pollution is extreme and being at altitude it is a difficult climate to move around in breathlessness and sun burn are what I experienced. I didn't like the place at all."
50,“Glory Tours and Travel”,"The service of Glory Tours and Travel, was simply awesome. They did a fantastic job all through our travels with them and made sure that we were happy with each and every place we visited.The knowledge and outgoing attitude of Daniel Damtew made us even more relaxed and appreciative of all the places we toured in Ethiopia. The places we dined and spent the nights were of great value for money and the hospitality was amazing. I am yet to tour a couple more places in Ethiopia and i will definately be contacting Glory Tours and Travel again."
20,"“Big, noisy busy city”","Addis was ok, just another large city with lots of traffic, construction etc. We spent just part of a day there."
40,“Unique”,"Addis is a very unique city - in terms of its culture, people and history. Well worth a visit and when you're there do visit the churches, museums and markets. A visit to the nearby hill top and Emperor Menelik's first palace is a must for an aerial view of the city and its environs"
50,“Heaven on Earth”,"Love Addis and its people. Excellent weather, largely safe to walk and roam around, good restaurants and reasonable night life."
30,“No one's favourite city”,"Addis itself is somewhat limited in its attractions though there is plenty to see around Ethiopia. Be very careful: Addis is pickpocket central. Beware of distraction techniques such as someone ""accidentally"" spitting on you and then wiping it down with a shirt - this is a distraction while you wallet disappears from your pocket."
50,“13 months of sunshine.”,"May think that this is not the right forum to review an entire city, Addis is the capital and seat of the UN and the AU, this is a diverse city with many opportunities.Addis is located at 2500 meters above sea level and it is really ´high ceilings here, Addis has an extremely pleasant climate, the people are very friendly and accommodating. Addis has to be one of the safest cities to live in, it is a bustling city, a melting pot if you will, Ethiopia today has more than 90 million people from different ethnic backgrounds, the coexistence in these circumstances is obliging and is therefore a great achievement. Come and experience the real Africa."
30,“The City of Addis Ababa”,"well, I will not call Addis such a turisty city but there are some nice things to do there and I can reccomened some:Addis Ababa University has a nice Ethiopian history musieum that shows the life in Ethiopia from chiledhood to death, different religuns, coltures, tribes and art.Piazza- the center of the city- it has shops and resturants. Be cearful and take care of your bag!Bole- A good area for shopping, eating and banks. many forreners go there.Cherchill street- a mane street with many gift shops that you can bargen with and the best place to buy coffee to take home- coffee tomoca.Entoto- a good place to get out and get a nice view of the city- more info in the Entoto tip..National museum- next to sades kilo. nice museme.to travel around the city you either take a big taxi or a privet one. the price difference is big but you can also bargen with the small taxis.for the big one to most of the places its 2.70 but if you go a short way its 1.30.If you go to Addis as a turist and not for buisness of volunteerwork i recoomened not more than 4-5 days.enjoy!"
40,"“Chill at Liquid Lounge,”","Great place, great food, great ambience and great music. Chill out at the ""happening place!"". Modern lounge and comfortable whether solo or with company."
50,"“Club H20, Addis Abeba”","Club H20 is decidedly one of the top three disco experiences I've ever had (and, like Sinatra, ""there's been a few...!"") I have party-ed in places like London, Paris, New York - but I can honestly say, H20 is up there with the best clubs in Rio d Janeiro in terms of sheer party mood. I kid you not! Great, pulsating atmosphere; super & varied music, African and Western; charming people to boot; cool & friendly guards; clean & queue-less toilets all through the evening; even the most refreshing air ducts, giving this raver a chance to cool down mid-dancing. Wow! - its all I can say! Go, dance the night away!"
50,“A Flower of a City”,"The New Flower is just that: A flower among cities. Sure, there are eyesores and heartbreaking scenes, but that place will always rank high on my list of alluring & mystic cities, like Kathmandu or Timbuktu. I say (from experience) even street kids in Addis have more culture and finesse than most...! Tenastalin, Addis!"
40,“A great African city”,"Addis Ababa is a very nice entrance point into Ethiopia, and surprisingly easy to get around and deal with. The streets are remarkably clean - despite often being full of sheep, goats and donkeys - and the traffic/drivers aren't crazy like they are in so many other cities (from Asia to Bangkok).There are lots of things to visit if you're there a day or two - museums and churches - and it's inexpensive (a local St. Georges beer in a nice beer garden for less than US$0.50).It also feels safe to walk around. Sure there are people trying to sell you things and the occasional beggar, but no worse than any other modern city.And we actually walked from the Yod Abyssinia restaurant to the airport on our last night there - how often can you do that in a city!"
40,"“Nice weather, Safe, cheap and chaotic”","Addis is arguably one of the safest cities in Africa and emerging very fast with lot of construction activities. People are friendly and most of them can understand enough English to get your needs done. Its advisable to use hotel taxies as the there is no taxi metres in Addis. A negotiation is a must before get on board. The rates are normally more than European capitals for car which is older than a retired professional. Addis is green and fertile and its embarassing to see so much poverty around. There are restaurents suited for all tastes and local food is not recommended as its mostly unhygienic. There is no history of great violence or crime in addis unlike its neighbours, but beware of chaotic places and pick pocketers"
30,“Party city”,"for me it was too crowded but i want for good reason (wedding) we had the best wedding and had lots of fun.Food is the big culture, I must say they have the best food, natural and organic too.To relax i would choose outside Addis, there are lots of resorts...with shocking standard of quality.Addis to me with hectic....but for party there is no place like Addis."
50,“Travel agent and trip organiser Ashenafi Kassa”,If you want to travel around Ethiopia I recommend this travel agent called Ashenafi Kassa ashuyae@yahoo.com or info@celebrityethiopiatour.comHe's really helpful and knows a lot about his countryHe can show you the best bars in Addis or book a car and guide if you want to travel in northern Ethiopia for example.
30,“Second largest city in Africa”,Or so was I told. In any case it's pretty chaotic city. Nevertheless you find some very interesting cultural places and museum harder to find in equatorial Africa. Also you can find good occidental food for when you are fed up of Injera!
50,“Places to see in Addis Ababa”,"Addis Ababa, which means ""New Flower"" in Amharic, is an intriguingly indigenous African city. Unlike many other African capitals, it's founding, growth and development, are not rooted in colonization. Founded in 1887 by Emperor Menelik II, This big, sprawling, hospitable city is 7,200-feet high in the foothills of Mount Entoto and the panoramic view from the peak is spectacular.Addis Ababa is a mix of the past and the present, sheep, cows and goats walking down the road, framed by skyscrapers in the background, the city and the small-town feel, the modern apartment buildings and the small houses with zinc roofs.If you happen to be in Addis Ababa for some reason and have some leisure time; need no worry what to do, here is some information about activities in Addis Ababa and surroundings that are worth spending your time with.

50,“Amazing trip. Friendly people”,"Back from Addis Ababa. Really clean city, really crowded. Very friendly people. Stay in city centre as horrific traffic makes it difficult and time consuming t o travel into town. The museum, with Lucy the 3,5 million year old skeleton is a must!Having a traditional meal at a local eatery. R150 for 5 with local drink (unknown percentage of alcohol as it is home fermented) and more than enough to eat."
30,“Lots of confusion..”,"Live here and the place never seizes to amaze me. there is so much confusion, it is actually interesting to observe..."
50,“Addis Ababa is changing”,"Friendly people, interesting mix, lots of development, great food"
40,“Senait Ethiopia Tours”,"WE are five family members from Australia. WE are back after 15 days trip with Senait Ethiopia Tours. The organizer was fantastic. All the accommodations were n the best standard, the guides, driver and all staff members were polite, knowledgeable and know how to handle clients. Only in one place miss understanding with waitress in hotel. we asked roasted chicken but the waitress ordered another. funny.We would like to recommend this inbound tour company to all travelers. We are very excited about our trip and would love to be back soon. you can reach them on www.sunnyethiopiatours.comJane, Australia"
40,“Good people”,I really like that Addis is a safe and relaxed city. So easy to make friends and have a really good time.
50,“True Home”,"Once you visit this place, u will fall in love, for sure u will go back"
40,“so modern”,"before coming to addis i thought i will find a poor third world country , but i was surprised , 3d cinema , malls , german bekrei , le monde and any thing you may find in casablanca , cairo ;or ryadh ! everything is vailable ! all marks all prices , big roads , air conditions , hot water , beside lots of nice cafes , museums , and gardens , local markets not to miss too"
10,“Haphazard”,Pollution abounds causing chest problems. Dirty city. Castillos restaurant good
40,“An eclectic mixture of treasures”,"The Lucy exhibition is the highlight, but well worth while visiting also for the various pieces excavated from sites across Ethiopia (from Aksum, Yeha etc.). Also some decent exhibits of art, costumes and cultural artefacts."
30,“generally fair”,the only thing that makes you feel that you are in a modern city are some very few and rare places such as Kefetew guest house or the LIQUID LOUNGE. the YOD ABISSINYA restaurant. HABESHA restaurant BAMBI's Supermarket.. road conditions are not good...........people are very friendly
30,“Great Future ahead”,"Addis is a great city, people are friendly and a lot of work is being done. I keep wondering why it is not better yet ... people only seem to know Ethiopia from articles about the border and country side regions. But Addis is a thriving city and they are working actively in construction, small businesses and hopefully also the communications structure (internet and 3G sucks) ... the fact that big businesses like i.e. McDonalds or Starucks are kept out . I don;t have any of the facts, and while I respect cultural herritage, it would bring in lots of foreign money and jobs, which would help this country.In general .. while close to the equator, Addis has a very pleasant climate (just be aware of the rainy season) and people are in general very friendly .. but you will get your ferengi (foreigner) treatment when you want to buy something."
50,"“Shopping in Addis Abeba, Clothing nexto ILRI Campus”","Excellent Clothing Shop within Holy City Mall (Second Floor, No 114) nexto ILRI entrance. You can choose from all kinds of very nice materials and decorations. You can order your own blouse, trousers, skirts and dresses. Also very nice possibilities for men and boys. In one week time they can deliver. Otherwise they have also wide range of scarfs and blouses ready to take with you. Prices are fair, considering excellent service."
50,“The cleanest capital in Africa”,"We like it all very much, a little troubled by the huge amounts of beggars, and a bit scary at the Mercato, still we encounters no real problems, feeling safe everywhere. Ethiopians are a example for mankind."
40,“A nice African capital city at top of the world!”,Beautiful and friendly people. Very safe place to walk and visit. Be aware of pickpocketers in Piazza and Mercato areas.
40,“Nice people and various historical attractions”,"Addis Ababa is the capital city of not only Ethiopian but for many international organizations including African Union, ECA, UN and various NGOs. Security wise, the city is more secure than any African countries. Just mini thefts here and there but generally very safe for tourists. The city has a very large market place called Merkato and it is really a spectacular place to visit. Since Addis is an old city, it has many tourist attractions such as museums Lucy and various Kings, old churches and historical sites. Basically, the people are friendly, shy, helpful and proud people. A must see city."
30,“no special highlights”,"chaotic city. The mercato is big but ugly. Nothing to walk around.The old railwaystation is nice, not in use anymore.There are a few interesting churches.The campus of the university is a oasis of tranquility"
40,“Bustling”,"I liked Addis. It is a typical African city, full of people and chaotic transport systems, beggars and traders trying to make a living and resplendent buildings and shops for the wealthy. Some buildings, like the Derg Monument, are over the top, but others fit well into an earlier age."
30,“Just okay”,"Lucy display was a disappointment to me. Not ideally presented considering the importance. Decent museum, but not a must see."
50,“feel different be different”,visitting addis as an adventure specially if it is your first time. people worry about safety when mentioning addis ababa but not any more. it is safer than ever. their culture is worth seeing. friendly people everywhere but be aware of pick pockets infront of bon cafe and merkato market. bon cafe is a must visit daily around 5 pm. it is the best place to meet new local people.addis is better than you expect and beyond your limits. it is a fun city believe me you will have more fun than any where else you just need to loosen up a little.
40,“Nice place”,"Nice city, good food, try the tibs, great night life. And a must is Mercato. PS take care of the pick pockets"
50,“Wonderful City”,"I used www.azebot.com to get a preview of the city. They have Addis and other cities on a nicely done map in their attractions page along with discounted hotels and cars. I stayed at Damu for a couple of nights and headed to Hawassa. I stayed at the same resort that I stayed the last time I was there named Lewi, only this time I got good discount through early online reservation on azebot.com. Overall, my early planing really helped me. Make sure you do the same and you will have a great exprience while saving load of money."
20,“You got to get to know it”,"Addis is an ugly city, smelly in parts, with huge pot holes that can swallow you up, with crazy motorists who will run you over because the can't drive, full of petty bureaucrats, anyone with a uniform will abuse their position. It has deperate poverty adjacent to opulence. The city needs a purge. However, it has a soul, a fantastic nightlife, vibrant with live music, parties, fun, lounges and endless private parties. I love it, and I miss it when I am not there, you just need to be very selective as to what you expect and how you use your time."
50,“Earthly Heaven”,"guess what, you have every what you want in Addis and in its serounding. you will get all kinds of attraction from historical, cultural, natural, musiuems, archeological, palantolgical, recreational and many mores please visit Addis Ababa before you end your life contrat in this world. if you are disappointing on visiting Addis and Ethiopia i will take the credit for bad review, but sure you are going to enjoy it. please do contact me on ashuyae@yahoo.com for any further information that i can provide for you on visiting Addis Ababa and the whole country Ethiopa.Peace!Ashu"
40,“Good City with Airconditioned climate”,"It is must visit for it's wonderful climate, humble people, good looking and energetic youth, fresh tasting food. The food at Zaika, and Indian restaurant annexed to hotel dream liner is excellent."
20,“Not my favorite city”,"Okay, the Ethiopian people are nice. But...the city itself was unattractive. Broken pavement, pollution, dirt everywhere, a disorganized sprawling metropolis. Very few buildings held any aesthetic appeal. A day is enough for Addis, visit other cities in Ethiopia."
40,“the best coffe in All Africa”,"On first observing Addis Ababa (‘New Flower’ in Amharic) It is a a little noisy, dusty, sprawling.... this is changing into a modern business centre for Africa’s fourth-largest city. The city was boosting, there is building construction (big) everywhere, and all over the country includedéGive the city a few days and you’ll appreciate its bizarre blend of past and present: with memory of Italian, for me the coffee (the best IN ALL AFRICA): latee or machiato, expresso in a real coffee machine. On wide boulevards, priests in medieval-looking robes mix with African bureaucrats. Every Ethiopian walk with a mobile phones and some with the odd herd of goats.Walking in Addis is like walking with an old friend. The Ethiopian woman are beautiful, different of else in Africa, people are friendly and have imagination. Like elsewhere, the beggers also have imagination trying to get your attention.Looking for a place to stay could be a challenge if you have a small budget, from cheap and dirty one, or with a little more like Almaz Pension, or MJ Pension, and after that you have a choice of big Hotels with big price.We suggest you to take your time; not just to see but to experience Addis Abeba"
50,“Very nice town and friendly people”,"Addis - and Ethiopia in general - deserves a place very high on a world traveller's agenda. Great climate, very friendly people with good language skills, exciting history. And Addis is a very well functioning town. Not the traffic chaos you often see in third world towns. Quite good standard of roads, hotels and airport."
20,“Boston Day Spa - Addis Ababa - service with a frown.”,"The service at this spa is horrible. When you walk in, all of the staff are huddled around the register area and when you approach them, it takes many minutes for anyone to say hello or welcome. When you ask for help or say what you want ""massage, haircut, etc"" they don't smile or offer any friendly service. You basically are either told to 'sit down' or 'follow them'. All of the staff walk around with frowns. When you get your haircut, they lean up against the wall and just stare. When they wash your hair in the sink, they use a cheap plastic scalp brush (the kind I use for my dog) so it tears your hair. The worst part is that after your services are finished, you have to go through the whole affair again when you go to pay, (group huddled around register, no smiles, no 'thank you come again' or 'how was your experience'). The only thing this place has going for it is the look (nice tile work etc). Overall the staff are arrogant and rude and there are too many other places to go in Addis that will give you just as good of service with a smile."
50,“A relaxed atmosphere”,"Most of the nationals speak at least a limited amount of English. Also it's a place to visit if you do not wish to spend alot of money, yet have a lavish standard of living. i ONLY SPENT ABOUT 1000 USD IN A 5 DAY PERIOD, to include the plane ticket , food,and taxis. My friend and I visited the National museum and I was very impressed with the display of the first humanoid(known as lucy). During the day I walked around Bole Rd, which is one of the main roads. It has alot of malls and cafes, but alot of beggers as well. Best way to handle this is to continue walking, and they will not pursue you. During the night we went to club illusion, where they played hip hop and an assortment of other music. I would recommend going at 1130pm-1230, after 2 am it became very overcrowded. I had great experience here and Will definetely return in the near future.I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND GETTING A VISA PRIOR TO ENTERING THE COUNTRY BECAUSE THE LINES WERE INCREDIBLY LONG UPON ARRIVAL."
40,“Experience of a lifetime”,"I would guess most tourist to Ethiopia only travel through the capital but if you want to see some of the 'real' culture I would recommend a stay here for a few days. Go to the museums which are fascinating (carry ID to get in) and if you get a chance walk up into the hills to see the city from above. It is so peaceful up in the hills and there is a ruined rock hewn church at the top you can go around, I was charged 30 birr to get in. There are also places you can get to on day trips from the capital such as Debre Libanos if you hire a car and driver. Like any city you have to be mindful of your safety and the biggest danger really is the mad traffic and lack of pavements, and even unmade roads in some areas of the town. But the people are so friendly and eager to practice their English on you. We got around in the blue and white line taxis - Toyota Hiaces which they manage to get 18 people in. They basically stop at various places and the 'conductor' shouts out the destination and everyone piles in. You do see people begging and it is a part of the culture for people to give small amounts. There are a range of markets and 'shack' shops and some nice restaurants. A lot of italian food along with traditional Ethiopian food. Also bring your earplugs if you want to sleep throught the calls to prayer. Ethiopia is a very religious country, with fasting (no meat) days on weds and fri every week, and more fasting before easter. Also dont forget it is new year in Sept and they are 7 years behind the uk. Ethiopia is very affordable, bring dollars as you can usually change them at your hotel for a good rate, failing that the banks. You need to drink bottled water but that is readily available and cheap. We had one day without electric or running water in the hotel, but to me that was part of the experience and does make you appreciate what we have in the west and take for granted every day. If you want to go somewhere a bit out of your comfort zone but with friendly locals I would really recommend Ethiopia."
40,“Wonderful trip”,"My husband and I had a wonderful trip to Addis. We were there for a week. We spent most of our time taking the mini bus around the city, going to the market, museums and different restaurants. I would advise those travelers to be careful of the many scammers throughout the city."
30,“Fascinating African Capital”,"Addis Ababa, in the heart of Ethiopia, is a place teaming with people and ideas. The cultures of various tribes all meet in the capital which creates a very unique city. Museums chronicling the history of Ethiopia can be found in several locations throughout the city. Great traditional restaurants are not only tasty but also affordable.It is a rather dirty city, but the people are very friendly and make up for some of the drawbacks."
40,“Addis Ababa - What is not visible to the naked eye”,"i get to see a lot of quirky and out of place stuff in my travels and this trip is no different. so belt up for the traveloguefirst halt was dubai airport. where i kept my cleanliness record of logging in a shower ever since i discovered it in the business class lounge. travel tip - always try and get a shower and s**t when on a long haul flight. another travel tip - always go to the handicap toilet. they're built like small cubicles where you can carry your hand carry stuffaddis ababa airport called the bole airport named after the village on which it was built. which is good in a way that's it's not named after some long forgotten leader. in addis everything is 15 minuts from bole road. which is about 10 km long.addis has a large italian population - and genuine italian restaurants run by italian families serving very good food. i ate at castellis' which is supposed to be the best in africaaddis also has a huge yugoslav embassy and a personal palance of president tito. neither tito not yogoslavia exist - one is dead the other all broken upi saw a lot of lada's which were russian version of the 60's fiat. the car has immense scrap value - becuase russia didn't have the tech to make thin cold roll steel so they made on large thickness steel to make their cars. not seen lada's anywhere elsethen the last king haile selassie who was killed by the marxists in 60's - this guy was supposed to be a direct descendant of queen sheba's flirtations and lack of protection with king solomon. head of the rasta fari cult - made famous by bob marley. and his rastafariansrastafarians come from jamaica and they've a simple philosophy. a man who smokes ganja lives happy and doesn't hurt. so they have huge opium farms in south of ethiopia, smoke, eat, sleep and do this endlessly. life is very easy there. i wouldn't mind doing it but there just a limit on how much reggage i can listen toethiopians have 13 months in a year with one month of 5 days (6 in leap year). they tell their time differently - as per them time should begin to count once the sun pops out and it should start with 1. so if you ever ask an ethiopian for the time, make sure you ask the person behind him as wellbeyonce was in addis 3 days before i did and 17000 people showed up for her at $120 a ticket.i also heard two very interesting comments - it is very expensive to be poor. the average ehtiopian pays $0.5 for a meal and sugar is $650/mt when it shouldn't be over $ 350. rice is double what is should be tooi could go on. some stuff depresses as it makes life seem very meaningless. but then the essence remains same. you run till you rest. or become a rastafarian. free resident visa in ethiopia and jamaica"
50,“Great City”,I lived in Addis for 3 years and still visit often. It is a great town with good shopping and attractions. It is fairly safe compared to others cities in Africa although petty crime such as pick poceting and minor burglaries are common.
50,“my experience in Addis Ababa”,"Addis Ababa is a unique place for anybody to visit. It's one of a kind in africa, or any other place. what makes addis unique, is the people, the joy, it's like there's life there. You see all kinds of people from beggers to some living a luxurious life; ( just check the houses there.) some of them are made of marble. Addis is modern in many ways, and at the same time, there are things you don't have, if you want to compare it with the western civilization. but I can say this, you look for something and can't find it is because you don't know your way around. People are very generous, gracious, and very smart. The rich culture is something to marvel. When you go to visit at someone's house, they will not let you go without eating. They offer whatever they have even if you just stopped by.overall, I have been to Addis Ababa, twice, and I very much fell in love with the city. there's something about it.Samantha clark"
50,"“Title: Impressions of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia from a first time visitor to Africa”","I walked off the Ethiopia Airlines 767 at Addis Ababa’s Bole International Airport on a Thursday morning hoping to see my business partner and good friend once I easily cleared customs. Bole, incidentally, is a modern and efficient airport. I called my friend on my mobile when I didn’t see him. He and his friends arrived shortly thereafter. (One thing you may as well learn now about many Ethiopians is that being on time by American standards has no place in this culture. And my friend couldn’t recall this flight ever being cleared through customs so easily, figuring he had at least an hour or two with delays in flights, etc.). I was rushed to their car and off we went to his family home, which is not far from the airport. I am one of the lucky tourists on a first time visit to stay with Ethiopians, as opposed to either of two international luxury hotels like the Sheraton or Hilton, or one of many independent hotels with varying degrees of service and amenities. Girum, my friend, had his friends unload my baggage once we arrived. They live near Haile Gebresalasie Road (And here’s tip number 2, there are no real addresses used anywhere. They may have an official complicated number recorded on some document somewhere, but addresses are listed something like this: Off Haile Gebresalasie Road near the Duty Free Shop. Take the right off the paved road at that point, seeing the new building underway to your right continuing up the road to the first road to your left etc.). All I could think about when I arrived at his home and was being ushered in to the family living/eating room was the road we just drove down to get from the airport to his home. It was paved until the turn-off to his lane and there were people on both sides of the street on sidewalks, where they existed, on the road and row upon row of small shops selling almost anything you can imagine with many bars, restaurants, and coffee places. Horns honk almost incessantly as part of this driving culture of blue cabs, blue mini-busses, and cars. There were also plenty of beggars and other locals hawking their wares whenever the car stopped or slowed down. And merging or turning onto another road is an experience you will want to experience with someone else at the driver’s seat! It was almost overwhelming but I would soon learn to adjust to this new and wildly unexpected environment. I should mention here this was my first visit not only to Ethiopia, but to Africa. Now to the present moment of arrival at the family home, his family had prepared the traditional coffee ceremony to celebrate my arrival. With wafting smells of roasted coffee beans presented to each guest in the room, incense, and the ceremony it was relaxing and even awe-inspiring as an introduction to this vast, ancient, culturally rich, and even holy land. You will also find coffee ceremonies at many hotels, restaurants, and even some of the local attractions.The same day of arrival my new friends took me to their social activities (read several bars/restaurants) and we had a welcome to Ethiopia party which lasted for many hours. The next day we decided to spend driving around Addis Ababa. One stop was for shai (locally popular hot spiced tea); once for a light snack of something locally enjoyed; once for fresh yogurt (the Ethiopian version is not even close to the pasteurized American version), so be careful if you elect to try it and if you’re feeling adventurous add some of their ground chili pepper which is the favored option; and, once for gas and coffee. Tip # 4 on getting with the local scene and people: relax, be with your new friends, become an Ethiopian in spirit. Stop for a break often. There are no “to go"" food and beverage items in stores and cafes in Addis Ababa and the rest of Ethiopia. It’s very civilized. You’ll discover the myriad shops that serve coffee and tea are everywhere and they all have Italian Espresso Machines.There are other hotels, inns, motels in the city and they have varying degrees of service and amenities from luxury to very basic, but clean. Prices are generall very low by western standards except for the Hilton and the Sheraton. My favorite guide book is the “Brandt” travel guide for Ethiopia edited by Philip Brook. He lives in South Africa and the fourth addition was the best available in my opinion. Actually, we spoke to several visitors on the trip including two ladies traveling alone from Israel and two from Germany ending an internship in medicine…we all agreed on this. There are other publications including one from Lonely Planet. However, the Bradt guide to Ethiopia for local flavor and understanding of the culture particularly if you are traveling alone or in a small group, this is tops! My trip paralleled the guide book and I’ve not mentioned details readily available in his book, but rather my version of this new-found land which I am adopting!I'll be happy to share more specific experiences of Addis to readers. A brief summary of what might prove interesting in Addis and nearby includes: the National Museum; various embassies; the Mercado, the largest enclosed and open air market in Africa covering many square miles (if you can't find it there, it probably doesn't exist); very affordable gold and silver shops; nearby Entoto mountains and forested areas, a local brewery where instead of tasting the brew like in the west, you merely bring a group of friends to the Meta brewery and party all day! You can order food in the indoor or outdoor setting (have someone else drive); so many restaurants/bars/entertainment places I can't list them all here. A favorite just to remind myself of the west is the Old Milk House that is located on the top floor of a high rise (10 or 11 stories) near the Organization of African Unity. It has great crisp thin crust pizza and a great view. There are several headquarters buildings related to the United Nations economic efforts in Africa also nearby. You should also not miss some new additions: near the round-a-bout near Medam Alem (sic) Cathedral out the Bole area is the new just opened Edna Mall with three or four first-run movies from the USA. They have assigned seating, fast food, amusement type section outside of the movie entrance aimed at the younger set, a great coffee shop, terrific bar/club, and it is currently the hip place to see other Addis residents who are considering themselves part of the happening of families and younger adults. I'm being a little personal here but three of our friends gained in Addis own three different places nearby this area. One is Sky Bar owned by Paul; The Blues Bar owned by Salla; and Canape Restaurant owned by Galilla (it is near the Old Train Station). Each is distinctively related to the owner's personality and each is usually present to make your visit really pleasant. All are relatively small but worth checking out if you want to become a regular while you are in Addis.Lastly, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention all the history surrounding the various Ethiopian Orthodox Churches and a Grand Mosque all worthy of visits. From Injera and a host of traditional foods to even ice cream you can find it in this city. Certainly it's got its contrasts with the old and new. And certainly if it's your first visit I want to suggest you read a short, but concise history and take a look at the Brandt travel guide at the very least. You'll find many excellent local guides who can help you make all the arrangements. I had the pleasure of working with one, Habtu, a University student who has formed his own company. Let me know how I can help you discover the alluring city of Addis and other parts of Ethiopia. I'll be writing more about other cities and habitats soon."
50,“Haven on the earth”,"I have just return from short break to Addis Ababa - Ethiopia, A haven on the earth, where every thing is simple by its nature, peoples and climate. I have stay at a place near Awrarish Hotel; meet good, honest, sincere friends. The weather is very fantastic, raining most of the day. Have visit very famous place called - Sodari, about 109 Km away from the capital Addis Ababa, in which you can stay for a day or 2 and enjoy the nature, the hot water as well as the animals. the place is very recommended by so many friends from local as well as foreign too. But please carry some foods to feed the Monkey.Overall I would say this is probably the best place I have ever stayed in on holidays and I am extremely fussy! Perhaps not the most convenient if all you want to do is theme parks, but if you want to mix a little luxury with the odd trip to the parks then this is an absolute must"
50,"“Afrika, wie es lebt...”","Hauptstadt mit viel Verkehr, kein regionaler Nahverkehr. Lustige alte ""LADA""-Taxis. Der Charme der Stadt besteht aus unzähligen Baustellen, wenig Gehsteigen und Staub ohne Ende. Dafür nette und freundliche Menschen. Und sehr viel schöne Frauen und Männer. Und überall bekommt tollen Kaffee."
40,“une ville à decouvrir”,"une jolie ville, en plein développement, les hotels sont d'un bon standing, restaurants sympas, et tres jolie ville africaine,"
40,“Vale cada minuto! Aproveitem!”,"A cidade surpreende! Várias coisas legais e inesperadas! A cidade tem um trânsito louco. A altitude de 2.700 m atrapalha muito. O povo é gentil, humilde e educado. O Sheraton surpreende pela ostentação. As igrejas pela originalidade... Vale a pena"
40,“Senza paura”,"Se pensate di andare in questa città con una mentalità turistica, farete bene a passare oltre. Bisogna cercare di entrare nella dimensione Africana dove il tempo ha un significato diverso dal nostro, ma anche tutto il resto. Ho fatto amicizia con un tassista e ci siamo messi d'accordo che mi avrebbe fatto da guida. Gli ho spiegato bene che ero interessato a vedere e capire la città. Lui ha capito che intendevo dire e mi ha portato in giro. Chiese,mercati, gente comune. E bene tenere gli occhi aperti, ma anche la mente e lo spirito. Altrimenti meglio stare a casa e vedersi un documentario comodamente sdraiati sul proprio divano."
30,"“Debe visitarse, pero es solo un punto de partida.”","Esta ciudad debe visitarse. Es necesario. Desde Mercato, hasta los ministerios, ONU... y en general su entramado callejero con la zona occidentalizada de Bole (barrio de embajadas y comercios). Sirve para hacerse una primera idea de las prioridades de este país y de su condición de país pobre pero no perdido. Luego es imprescindible emprender viaje hacia el norte o el sur y allí se perfila la autética imagen que quedará en la reteina de cada uno."
30,"“Cidade caótica, talvez em vias de melhor organização”","Embora tenha alguns locais interessantes como o museu do horror, correspondente ao período comunista, e um museu etnográfico com algumas peças interessantes, é uma cidade caótica e desinteressante. Alguns edifícios que arquitetonicamente poderão ser interessantes perdem pelo enquadramento em ruas descuidadas e cheias de pó. De qualquer forma é uma cidade cheia de vida e que merece um dia de visita. Não perder os restaurantes e bares com jazz que é uma das características mais interessantes da cidade."
40,“Muito interessante”,"É a capital e a maior cidade da Etiópia, sede da União Africana, sendo uma cidade multi-cultural, contem até 80 nacionalidades e línguas diferentes, como também comunidades cristãs, muçulmanas e judias. Foi fundada em 1887 pela esposa do então imperador Menelik, Taitu e por isso o significado do nome da cidade, ""nova flor"". É rodeada de montanhas cobertas de matas de eucaliptos. Nas proximidades nasce um dos afluentes do Nilo Azul.Eu gostei muito de caminhar pela cidade, conhecer os restaurantes e cafés."
40,“addis ababa linda cidade”,"Gostei muito desta cidade cheia de vida e movimento, com clima de altura, e ar puro, passeamos até as montanhas e pudemos ver de cima a cidade no vale, é um lindo passeio"
40,“a surpreendente capital da Etiópia”,"Addis Ababa, assim como o país de que é a capital, a Etiópia, é surpreendente. Quem vai imaginando uma cidade africana caótica e quente vai se surpreender com a relativa modernidade de sua silhueta e suas ruas, e o ar frio de montanha da terceira capital mais alta do mundo. Talvez não tenha atrações imperdíveis, mas é um ótimo lugar para se passar uns dois dias passeando com tranquilidade e conhecendo mais sobre a história, a culinária e a cultura da Etiópia."
10,"“Addis Ababa: smog, caos e disagi...”","L'impatto con Addis è traumatico: una città terribilmente inquinata, con un traffico infernale e soprattutto con in giro gente che non ha la benché minima idea di cosa significa guidare. Fare un giro a piedi è pressoché impossibile o al limite scomodo perché si viene subito sopraffatti dal fetore dello smog e delle fogne a cielo aperto. In giro, la povertà è dilagante: mendicanti, ciechi, storpi, se poi siete nella zona chiamata ""Piazza"" incontrerete anche lebbrosi ad ogni angolo. Per non parlare poi delle pulci che vi saltano letteralmente addosso (i primi tempi che stavo qui ne ero continuamente tormentata, e così anche i miei amici...) Gli stranieri (i ""farengi"", come vengono chiamati qui) sono considerati non risorsa da ""coccolare"" e tenere stretta, ma solo prede da dissanguare per estorcere denaro. Davvero poche sono le persone affidabili, quindi non date retta a chiunque voglia aiutarvi perché ha probabilmente come unico scopo quello di estorcervi dei soldi. Io ci vivo per lavoro e credetemi se vi dico che malgrado sia qui ormai da mesi faccio davvero fatica ad ambientarmi (troppo smog...terribile per gli occhi ed i polmoni). Unica bellezza sono alcune zone circostanti: tutti qui cercano di scappare durante il weekend per poter respirare aria pulita. Ci sono molte attrattive nelle vicinanze, ma per raggiungerle sono pochi i mezzi di trasporto ""comune"" che potrete utilizzare senza incorrere in interminabili soste fuori orario, code impreviste e pulci, l'unica via di fuga è l'automobile e se non l'avete dovete per forza ricorrere ad autisti che si fanno pagare copiosamente. Insomma, vivere qui non è affatto facile!"
40,"“Distinto, amable... para comprender y querer...”","No se puede evaluar una capital africana desde la perspectiva de las Américas o Europa... es distinto. Se puede considerar una ciudad fea, desordenada, caótica... hasta que uno se acostumbra a ella, la empieza a entender y a encontrarle su propio encanto.La gente es extremadamente amable aún cuando sea, como dicen otros comentarios, un ferenji. Pero si uno aprende las palabras mágicas de bake y bakesh (por favor, la primera versión para dirigirse a un hombre y la segunda a una mujer), o amensenguelao (gracias) o ishi (OK, todo bien), las cosas pueden cambiar y bastante.Recuerden los viajeros que aquí no hay ""direcciones"" como estamos acostumbrados en nuestras ciudades, todo es en ""tal barrio"" cerca de ""tal cosa..."" y muchos taxistas van a tardar en encontrar el destino salvo que sea algo muy conocido.Las calles, salvo grandes avenidas, por la noche, no tienen iluminación pública y puede generarnos cierto resquemor...Tuve la experiencia de haber perdido la valija en la conexión de vuelos para llegar y comprar algunas cosas imprescindibles fue toda una aventura, como ser, el líquido limpiador para lentes de contacto... más de 10 farmacias y otras tantas ópticas (hasta al consultorio de un oculista fui a dar...) para encontar un lugar donde comprarlo... Consejo... traigan en su maleta de a bordo todo lo imprescindible para unos días (desde muchos destinos no hay vuelos diarios)...No tengan miedo a visitar Addis, si le ponen ""buena onda"", encontrarán su exótico encanto. Les dejo un par de fotos"
30,"“Une expérience étonnante, mais peu touristique!”","Addis Abeba est sans conteste une ville fascinante par son mariage entre un très vieux pays, dont la civilisation est un pont entre l'Afrique noire et le Moyen-Orient, et une économie en plein boom. Il y a des chantiers partout.Mais la ville est récente (fondée à la fin du XIXe siècle) et ne compte que peu de monuments vraiment intéressants. A voir, naturellement, les cathédrales, le Musée national et le Mercato. Mais elle sert surtout de porte d'entrée ou de base arrière à une visite de l'Ethiopie, un pays réellement fascinant."
40,“Diferente do que eu imaginava”,"Adis Abeba foi foi bem diferente do que eu imaginava. A cidade é grande, com avenidas largas e o que mais me chamou a atenção foi a segurança. Caminhamos muito por várias partes da cidade e não sentimos medo em momento algum."
40,“じっくり味わいたい街”,仕事の関係で３日ほど滞在。名物コーヒーは日本基準をはるかに上回る苦さでした。ミルク（なぜか茶色が多い）で薄めて飲む方が胃に優しそう。普段はブラック派ですが、砂糖を入れて飲んでました。食べ物は主食のインジュラが特筆。独特の酸味あり。食感も独特。先ずは試してみて。現地の人は大好きだそうです。街は建設ラッシュ（というか、あまり進んでいない？）で、道路はどこも大渋滞。鉄道建設が予定されているけど、踏切がないので事故がおこらないか心配。民族音楽はかなり独特。日本の昭和４０年代頃の演歌調にロックが混ざったもの。エチオピア航空ではずっと流れてました。いやはや、３日くらいではとても味わいきれない、深みのある街でした。
50,“Bela surpresa!”,"A capital da Etiópia é uma cidade em construção: o centro e boa parte da cidade estão sendo remodelados, com novas passarelas, calçadas, prédios, etc.Diferentemente do que muitos imaginam (baseado nas imagens da Etiópia e a fome dos anos 80), a cidade é bastante funcional, está em crescimento e tem de tudo.Há museus interessantes, bons restaurantes e MUITO SEGURO!!!Recomendo a visita!"
50,“Soggiorno solidale”,Visita alle scuole e attività delle comunità salesiane in Etiopia; emozionante e affascinante; comprese le visite ai luoghi principali della capitale e nei lontani villaggi attorno a Zwai.
40,“Détente et sérénité”,"Que ce soit à Addis même , ou à travers toute l Ethiopie on se sent détendu serein et même béat parmi ces Ethiopiens pleins de quiétude et toujours disposés à rendre service et allègrement montrer leur sens de l hospitalité ."
10,“Неинтересный город”,Провели в городе несколько часов во время стыковки рейсов. Грязный и скучный город с большим количеством попрошаек. Единственное ради чего его стоит посетить - купить в супермаркете кофе.
20,“скучно”,"несмотря на то, что в Эфиопии масса интересных мест, в столице страны нужно стараться провести как можно меньше времени -- делать, в туристическом плане, тут нечего. пара неинтересных музеев, пара неинтересных церквей, и все. к тому ж все это разбросано на довольно большом расстоянии друг от друга -- центра, как такового, в Аддис Абебе нет"
30,“Ein Tag A A reicht”,"Kommt man hierher auf einer Kulturreise, dann gehts sowieso gleich weiter ins Land. Wir haben keinen vernünftigen Grund gesehen, auch nach Konsultation mit einer Reiseagentur, länger als einen 23 h Zwangsstop hier zu verweilen. Es ist weder gemütlich zum Flanieren oder Wandern, noch sauber oder besonders sicher. Unser Taxifaahrer wurde bedrängt, da er ""hilfsbereite Führer"" gehindert hat, die Rucksack- und Jackentaschen mit Taschenspielertricks (Frage nach Feuer) auszuplündern."
30,“Tres ciudades en una.”,"Zona de Bole, bien, zona de la Piazza un poco más pobre, zona de Mercato, donde más nos movimos, mucha pobreza, pero un lugar impresionante."
50,“столица”,"Аддис-Абеба. Конечно, увиденное «немного» отличается от моих представлений об этом городе. В глаза бросаются нищета, недостроенные здания, микроскопические трущобы. Периодически попадаются люди в совершенно изорванных одеждах. На улицах грязно. Ловлю себя на мысли, что ни за что на свете не пошла бы здесь гулять после захода солнца. Благо я наблюдаю за всем этим из-за стекла новенького комфортного Land Cruiser 100."
30,“Salid pronto de Addis”,"Lo más bonito de Etiopia no está en esta ciudad. Id a los puestecitos de cerca de la piazza y fuera. Sobretodo tened cuidado con los niños que se acercan, ya que acostumbran a distraer al farangi y robarle."
40,“Resort Kuriftu”,"E' davvero un posto carino.Dista 50 km da Addis Ababa è vicino al lago.Molto confortevoli le camere , il ristorante davvero ottimo colazione abbondante e diversi menu locali e non per tutti I gusti.All'interno potete trovare una piscina la sala massaggi e una palestra attrezzata e poi la sala biliardo."
30,“Experiência diferente”,"A cidade de Addis Ababa é uma cidade interessante pelos grandes contrastes entre a vida urbana e rural. Nas movimentadas e caóticas ruas da cidade, repleta de carros desde os mais velhos até os mais luxuosos, podemos encontrar pastores com seus rebanhos nem um pouco preocupados com o movimento. A cidade tem seus atrativos, porém sem muito glamour. Vale destacar o Museu Nacional e algumas catedrais. Também existe vários cafés espalhados pela cidade, que deve ser visitados."
30,“Africa e suas historias...”,"Minha viagem a Addis Ababa, foi interessante, tivemos a sorte de conseguir um guia que falava português. Conhecemos um mercado popular, e assim pode ter uma ideia de como a Africa é.Comi um delicioso milho feito na brasa. E comprei uma belissima camisa com o Leão de Judah."
30,“Cidade Histórica com Cultura Africana”,"Cidade muito parecida com os bairros de periferia de São Paulo, como São Miguel Paulista, Ermelino Matarazzo, etc.Cidade simples com muitos camelos e vendedores ambulantes.Muita gente andando na rua e muitas crianças brincando nas ruas.Capital e maior cidade da Etiópia."
40,“歴史あるまち”,アフリカ連合のある歴史あるまちアジスアベバ。中国支援で高層ビルも建設されてきており、近代化の道を進みつつあります。今回は町に中心部が工事をしており渋滞がすごかったです。エチオピアの良いところは、イタリア文化の影響でどこに行っても美味しいマキアート、コーヒーが飲めること。コーヒーセレモニーもあるので、興味がある方は是非挑戦してみてください。
50,"“""Contrasti""”","Ci si deve abituare alla povertà più totale come alla ricchezza più sfrenata. Contrasti che davvero lasciano sbigottiti, ma questa è la realtà di una città di tre milioni di abitanti dove convivono un centinaio di nazionalità diverse..."
40,“Cultura fascinante.”,"A dança, a culinária, as pessoas, Addis Abeba é uma cidade de fortes contrastes e cheia de tradição e cultura. A população muçulmana é bastante cordial e gosta de receber."
40,“Uma cidade histórica”,"A Etiópia é uma país muito antigo. Sua geografia é muito linda. Nela está o Nilo Azul, importante braço que compõe o Rio Nilo.Addis Ababa é a capital."
30,“Culturalmente interessante”,A cidade é muito suja e com muitas ruas de terra. Mas é muito interessante aprender um pouco da cultura do país passeando pela capital. Toda a história e cultura dos Etíopes é muito diferente da nossa.É recomendável sair com um taxista indicado ou um guia.
20,“Ciudad no muy linda”,"Esta ciudad no se puede calificar como linda. Es mas bien fea. Casi nada de luz a la noche, no da ganas de recorrerla. Si es recomendable ir al mercado que esta al lado del correo, en donde regateando y yendo cerca de la hora de cierre, tipo 6 de la tarde, se puede comprar cosas interesantes o souvenirs. No hay luz en la mayoria de los negocios, por tanto es conveniente ir con una linterna."
30,“Depende muito do que vem fazer”,"Não tudo que vemos na Televisão e muita reallidade, aqui tem pessoas com seus carros dos ano, tamb;em tem pessoas que ficam pelas ruas pedindo dinheiro, tem seus pontos turisticos, não como em outros paises.Como em todo lugar tem que andar com muita atenção e precavidos. Não da muito confiança para aquelas pessoas que chegam te ofereçendo ajudq para levar aos lugares, no final você tem que desenrrolar e negociar um preço que não estava combinado.Os taxis são bem antigos e acabados por;em e o que a cidade tem.As vezes me pergunto o que fazem com a ajudaq que eu, você e outros dão para este Pais.Se você vive em um apartamento e classe media e se vive em uma casa com segurança e rico.Infelismente e o que vemos e não podemos fazer muito."
50,“Ich habe mich hier unheimlich wohl gefühlt!”,"Im Gegensatz zu ein Paar Leuten hier, die es wohl nicht ertragen wenn etwas keinen europäischen Standard hat, bin ich nur schweren Herzens wieder nach Deutschland gekommen. Ich hatte eine wunderschöne Zeit in Addis Ababa! Wenn man natürlich ein touristisches Paradies erwartet und von vorne bis hinten bedient werden möchte, ist man in das falsche Land gereist. Ich habe dort sehr viele nette Menschen kennen gelernt und wenn man 2 Monate dort verbracht hat, weiß man auch mit Leuten umzugehen, die einen auf der Straße anquatschen, wenn das dann noch passiert, denn die sind ja auch nicht blöd und begreifen recht schnell, wer jetzt ein ""Touri"" ist und wer hier lebt, auch wenn es nur für kurze Zeit ist. Man muss eben die richtigen Ecken kennen und sich nicht so blöd anstellen. Alles in Allem eine wunderschöne Stadt, gefüllt mit einer Menge netter Menschen und gutem Essen und Bier. :)(Ich war von Januar bis März 2012 dort, das kann man hier bei den Zeitangaben nicht auswählen)"
20,“Rispetto al resto dell'Etiopia è davvero poca cosa.....”,"Tutte le volte che arrivo ad Addis dopo aver visto altre zone dell'Etiopia ho come la sensazione di entrare in un incubo. La bellezza e l'armonia di aree come la rift valley o gli altopiani si scontra contro il caos di questa città che si intravede già avvicinandosi alla periferia sotto forma di interminabili file di camion e macchine in perenne zig zag tra di loro. La città è fatta di questo, di smog, di troppi mendicanti e disperati, di sparuti alberghi in stile occidentale e delle ricche ambasciate (in stridente contrasto col resto). Qualche ristorante interessante è una buona risorsa dopo giorni passati a mangiare injera e tibs, ma purtroppo non è molto. Infatti, mentre la povertà della maggior parte dell'Etiopia vive in perenne equilibrio con se stessa (tanti o forse tutti sono poveri di beni ma ricchi di sorrisi), Addis mi dà sempre l'impressione di enfatizzare la povertà estrema ed assoluta. E per questo mi lascia sempre un senso di tristezza profonda...."
30,“Necessario capirla bene”,"Non è certo il posto più bello dell'Etiopia, anzi, ma dopo esserci stato diverse volte anche per molti giorni, posso dire che Addis Abeba sia una chiave di lettura della realtà etiope necessaria da capire e conoscere. Senza farsi spaventare dalle prime impressioni, dai mendicanti, dal caos, dallo smog. Come tutte le grandi capitali, ci vuole il suo temo per assaporarla, al di la di quelle che sono le attrazioni turistiche. Purtroppo molti tour le dedicano non più di due giorni."
30,“No he sabido encontrar casi nada de interés en Addis”,"No he sabido encontrar casi nada de interés en Addis a excepción del museo Etnológico y alguna que otra Iglesia.Ciudad anodina de la cual no he sabido encontrar sus encantos, que seguro los tendrá."

20,“addis abeba caos”,"limpieza nula, basura y desperdicios por todo el centro de la ciudad, esto no tiene que ver con la pobrezaseguridad poca, (cuidado con los niños, uno te distrae y los demas te roban)buenas vistas para fotos, muchisima gente conviviendo con animales por las calles,pobreza esignada"
40,“una città dalle grandi contraddizioni”,"Addis Abeba è una città dalle grandi contraddizioni.Caotica, affollata, sporca, inquinata.La città si adagia in una conca ricca di verde (soprattutto eucalipti) ma non presenta davvero nulla di bello.Ci sono poi dei punti interessanti (dal punto di vista culturale e storico) ma vanno ricercati e sono comunque abbastanza difficili da fruire. Un solo hotel di livello ""internazionale "" vero ,dove si può passare una discreta permanenza e godere di un'ottima cucina.Comunque una città interessante per la sua religiosità, per la sua cultura e per le tante dcontraddizioni che vengono proposte ad ogni angolo al turista ""ricco"" che in questi posti ha la fortuna di passare solo per visitare"
30,“Contraddizioni africane..”,"Sono stato per lavoro in Etiopia, e necessariamente per raggiungere le missioni si passa dalla capitale, dove si atterra e si riparte.Addis Abeba, ""il nuovo fiore"" della principessa Taitù, è una capitale caotica e costantemente ""work-in-progress"" dove coesistono e convivono branchi di mucche al pascolo nelle aiuole spartitraffico e manager cinesi in land cruiser, etiopi obesi ed ipertesi con altri denutriti e magari ammalati di filariosi.Contraddizioni africane.Le cose da vedere dal punto di vista storico-architettonico sono la chiesa di Maryam con adiacente piccolo museo di paramenti sacri e gli edifici della reggia, termine assolutamente improprio per il concetto occidentale di ""reggia"", di Menelik II.Ci sono poi le vestigia coloniali italiane, le terme, e, abbastanza vicine ma raggiungibili solo con un sobbalzante percorso in jeep nei boschi, i ruderi di Washa Michael, una della poche chiese rupestri visibili, la più vicina rispetto ad Adadi Maryam, altra chiesa scavata nella roccia a circa 60 km dalla capitale.Il museo con Lucy meriterebbe ben altra sistemazione (Lucy originale è altrove, qui c'è solo una copia..) e vale a stento il costo del biglietto.Belle le colline Entoto, con una vista sulla valle imperdibile."
40,“surprenant”,"ville gigantesque sans véritable centre, produit de l'histoire et des vagues d'arrivée liées aux sécheresses successives. Étonnant mélange entre modernité et authenticité, Addis mérite le détour pour ses sites remarquables et la gentillesse policée des habitants. elle constitue le point de départ de la visite d'un pays fabuleux et se pose également en hub important de la desserte des pays d'Afrique orientale et centrale."
40,“Non solo Lucy”,"Pur un avendo niente di particolare questa grande capitale africana merita un visita. È molto interessante osservare la vita quotidiana nei mercati o nelle zone più eleganti. Se avete un po' di tempo un caffè e dei pop corn, ,rito abituale di tutti gli abitanti. Andate al famoso museo dove viene custodita una copia della nostra antenata Lucy.T"
20,“Addis muss man nicht gesehen haben”,"Addis Abeba erstickt im Verkehr und im Dreck. Es gibt keine Shopping Center, die den Namen verdienen, es gibt keine Supermärkte. Es wird zwar viel gebaut, aber alles gesichtslose Gebäude, deren Architekten man am liebesten die Lizenz entziehen würde. In ein paar Jahren wird es vielleicht etwas besser, wenn die chinesischen Bauarbeiter all die begonnen Straßenprojekte fertiggestellt haben."
40,"“Après la brousse, le confort.”","Ville pleine de vie, Musée a voir LUCIE si elle est de retour ;ne pas oublié un bon café, la circulation pour un étranger est pleine de risques , prévoir un chauffeur ou un bon taxi retenu à l'hotel."
20,“Si puo' evitare”,"Ho trovato questa citta' priva di fascino, con un traffico allucinante dopo le 17,30 ,per fare 1 km potreste metterci un'ora a quell'ora ,noi dall'entrata della citta' all'hotel Jupiter ci abbiamo messo 2 ore e piu' e con un gran autista.Ricordate di non andare al famoso mercato perche' vi trovereste quasi certamente privi di portafogli ,documenti ...sconsigliatisssimo"
30,“Médio”,"Muito bom atendimento e pessoas muito simpáticas.Não gostei de ver muitas pessoas na Rua, sem Trabalho"
30,“Caotica e inquinata”,"Città enorme e caotica,tappa di transito verso altre mete, appare priva di reali attrattive,( che invece si apprezzano in altre elebri megalopoli non occidentali).L'architettura sembra un grande scadente cantiere, soprattutto viario, il traffico automobilistico, quasi insopportabile dovunque, produce livelli di inquinamento elevato di quella che sarebbe la famosa aria leggera e profumata dell'altopiano, decantata dalle cronache dei colonizzatori italiani degli anni trenta.Pochi gli edifici e le piazze degni di uno scatto fotografico. Di grande fascino invece la popolazione, bella, severa, che sembra perennemente in cammino,fiumi di gente che si sposta,continuamente,a qualunque ora, da dove e per dove non si sa.Merita un soggiorno più prolungato per scoprirla meglio."
50,“markt”,De immense Mercator van Addis is een belevenis. Wij waren wel erg blij met onze vriend uit Addis die met ons meeliep; je zou verdwalen!!
30,“Una città in forte espansione”,La città è relativamente recente e manca di un nucleo storico antico (come invece puoi trovare ad Harrar) E' in forte espansione edilizia e le infrastrutture stradali sono in condizioni di manutenzione precaria. Ma è abbastanza sicura e offre comunque la possibilità di visitare luoghi interessanti e di scoprire aspetti autentici della vita e della cultura etiope
30,“ETIOPIA O LA AMI O NON LA CAPISCI !”,"sono al mio secondo viaggio in questa terra che mi ha affascinata ! Si affascinata con la sua poverta indiscussa con la sua arretratezza ma con la sua grandissima generosita e accoglienza !Mi sono unita ad una missione umanitaria che sta costruendo un ospedale a 5 ore di fuoristrada da Addis Abeba , il villaggio e Hured , questi missionari hanno gia portato l'acqua e la scuola , adesso e la volta dell'ospedale !!La situazione che ho vissuta e strana : niente telefoni anche satellitari , niente internet, niente corrente elettrica.....ma la gente del posto col suo amore e la sua accoglienza non ti fanno sentire la mancanza du questi mezzi a cui siamo cosi abituati : Hanno bisogno di aiuto e te lo chiedono con dignità ...Mi sono innamorata ?? Si , ci tornerò senza dubbio !Vuoi andare in un luogo dove sentrti veramente utile e privilegiato per quello che hai ? scegli l'Etiopia !"
50,“Ville formidable”,"Ville très grande et en pleine construction, Un mélange de modernisme européen avec de petite boutiques africainesConduite anarchique à la mode africaine mais avec un respect des autres conducteurs que je n'ai vu nul part ailleurs.L'incroyable gentillesse et le respect des Ethiopiens.L'odeur de café et d'encens à chaque coin de rue."
20,“Piuttosto deludente”,Non avevo grandi aspettative da questa città e i due giorni trascorsi ad Addis Abeba hanno confermato tutto ciò. Sia la chiesa della Trinità sia quella di San Giorgio sono interessanti (soprattutto la seconda) ma nulla di più. Piacevole il panorama visto dalla collina di Entoto e curioso il mercato che c'é ai piedi della medesima. Il Museo Nazionale è abbastanza deludente soprattutto per quanto riguarda Lucy mentre ho trovato più interessante la parte di reperti archeologici che si trova al piano terreno. Molto interessante invece il Museo Etnologico. Visti i rischi di borseggio non siamo invece stati al Markato.
30,“Nichts besonders”,"Die Stadt Addis Abeba ist eigentlich nichts besonderes. Es ist eher ein Moloch, mit viel Verkehr zu den Hauptverkehrszeiten. Ich habe mir einen Guide mit Auto gebucht und bin mit ihm durch die Stadt gefahren. Das war ganz in Ordnung so. Alleine zu Fuss hätte ich mich aber nicht so sicher gefühlt in der Stadt. Empfehlen kann ich das Hilton Hotel."
40,“현지인과 어울릴때”,"에티오피아에 가면 현지인과의 인사가 허그 좌우3번 친밀한 사이면5번이더군요.그리고 어린아이들도 안기는걸 좋아 했어요.그러다 보니 현지인은 물지 않는 벼룩이 옮겨오는 경우가 있답니다.벼룩 물려보면 알지만 얼굴과 손만 빼고 온몸이 물려서 얼마나 가려운지 모른답니다.가려움에 바르는 연고를 가져가시면 도움이 됩니다만,더운물에 사우나를 하고(극히 제한된 경우이긴 하지만)드라이어로 물린곳을 쐬면 좀 해결이 될라나?암튼 벼룩물린 가려움 오래갑니다"
30,“Lebhafte afrikanische Großstadt”,"Diese Stadt ist interessant in vielerlei hinsicht. Da wäre der Mercato (größter Markt Ostafrikans), mehrere Museen welche die Geschichte und Lebensweise der Äthiopier näherbringen.Der Verkehr ist grauenhaft und sehr gefährlich. Abseits von Sehenswürdigkeiten sollte man sich als Tourist NICHT unbedingt aufhalten, die Gefahr von Überfällen wäre einfach zu groß (auch aufgrund der hohen Arbeitskosigkeit). Bewachtes Hotelgelände nach ca 18 Uhr nicht mehr verlassen!Fazit: Addis ist (zusammen mit einer Rundreise durch Äthiopien) eine Reise wert."
50,“Phänomenal muss man gesehen und gefühlt haben”,"Also wenn man weltoffen ist und auch Globetrottermentalität besitzt, ist in Addis Abeba ganz richtig. Kommt man in Bole am Flughafen an, hat man das Gefühl man ist noch in Deutschland. Aber der erste Schritt nach draussen lässt einen schon bald fühlen und riechen, das man in eine ganz andere Welt eintaucht. Und damit beginnt schon ein phantastisches Abenteuer. Die Mentalität der Äthiopieaner zieht einen derartig in den Bann und ihre ausgelichene Art und Weise macht es Europaner sehr einfach zum wohlfühlen. Fährt man ein bisschen ausserhalb nach Sodere zu den warmen Quellen hat man das Gefühl nie wieder weg zu wollen.In den Worten meines Sohnes ganz einfach zu sagen. ""Die Stadt ist dreckig aber die Menschen sind viel viel viel nett und hier möchte ich für immer bleiben."" Mein Sohn ist 5 Jahre alt und vergleicht München die sauberste Stadt die ich kenne mit Addis. ;-)Na also mit Worten nicht zu beschreiben, ich denke nicht ohne Grund die Stadt der Städte für Rastafaris & Co. Von meiner Seite eine muss für jeden der das ganz andere liebt.Für mich ein Traum und Äthiopien sieht mich ganz bald wieder."
