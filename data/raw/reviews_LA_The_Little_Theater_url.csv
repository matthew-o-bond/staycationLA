20,Could be so much better.,"We thought we were attending a Pinocchio puppet show with our son. Instead, it was a live show played by unprofessional adults. Everything about the performance was very amateurish. You would think in the Los Angeles area there would be many singers, actors, dancers, wannabe directors who could pull off topnotch entertainment. Not so here. For $15 a ticket, ""quality theater"" takes on a poorly-directed, primary school, dummed-down aspect. The actors didn't know their lines well and had no rapport with the children in the audience. The whole show was not well thought out and completely unmemorable right down to the props. The production we saw was delayed to wait for a party to arrive. Fifteen minutes later, the group was a no-show. Several announcements were made for children to go to the restroom during the wait because it was located behind the stage. My husband and I could have played, danced, and sung the parts as well or better than these actors...and he is tone deaf. Seriously, even the children were not impressed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SharonM373
