50,Great night in the park,I cannot say enough about the enjoyment we had watching Shakespeare in the Park last evening put on my the Independent Shakespeare Co. The production was 1st class with great music and acting. I cannot say enough!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulsF2452SQ
50,So glad I got to go!,"Visited my daughter in LA and went to see ""The Two Gentlemen of Verona"" in Griffith Park done by this company. Such a fun time and a great watch! Bring a jacket as it is at a little higher elevation and actually gets a bit cold there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kjgardeski
50,My favorite thing in LA,"ISCLA seriously puts on the best shows anywhere, and to top it all off, it's free. Their summer festival in Griffith Park is the only reason I look forward to the sweltering hot days of summer. Their actors are top notch and you can tell just how much they love what they do.Bring a picnic, get there early to grab a good spot, and bring some cash to donate at the end. They do this for free, but there are still a lot of costs to cover on their end!They also have shows throughout the year in their studio space. I've seen a few of them (Othello, Midsummer Night's Dream, and A Christmas Carol) and they're always just incredible.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarahsW6005EP
50,"Can't say enough about the productions, cast and crew: ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS!","Hands down one of (if not THE) best productions you'll see for free or otherwise in the LA area and beyond. Every performance is riveting and entertaining. The audience is always well-behaved and just a fantastic crowd that love to support such a great way to offer the arts to everyone, regardless of affordability.I have been going to the plays since they started in Barnsdall Park in Hollywood (over 10 years?) and can honestly say that I've never been disappointed. I have brought so many friends and they get hooked and bring their friends! We LOVE bringing a picnic beforehand, it's tons of fun! It's just a super part of our summer and a great cause.If you ever want to make a donation, ISC is definitely a worthwhile entity.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christinascucina
50,Great Experience,Nice and clear vocals to hear. Great and kind cast. Wonderful job of Richard III. Signs are everywhere so not hat hard to find once you get to the parking lots. For both family and friends.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rachaelg223
50,Studio Productions are Awesome,"Shakespeare in the Park is great, but we've been to several productions in the ISC studio in Atwater Village and every single one has been terrific as well. If the idea of ""in your face Shakespeare"" appeals, this company is The Best.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/miandho
50,Shakespeare in the Park is AWESOME for for the Whole Family!!!,"I took my wife and two teenage daughters to the old Griffith Park Zoo to experience the Shakespeare in the Park. What a great experience. They set the classic story to a punk rock theme and it was awesome! It was my daughters' first real experience with Shakespeare.I highly recommend that you go way early to get a good spot!!! Bring a big blanket!!! You can bring a picnic and wine. Nobody says anything unless you are being silly but for the most part, be responsible and you will be fine.The actors interact with the crowd during the performance. It really is an experience.Do not expect to get right out at the end of the show. There is a one lane road in and out of the park. the show caters to roughly over 2K-3K people. There is a bit of a moderate hike of about 1/4 of a mile up a hill. Bring a flashlight for you way out. They have lighting but it was limited and just enough to get down.Truly an experience you should not miss!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EricStarcher1974
50,Brilliant and Entertaining Theater Company,"Run right out to the Old Zoo at Griffith Park to see ""Romeo and Juliet"" in July 2015 and ""Much Ado About Nothing"" in August 2015. Performance are on Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays at 7:00 p.m. Just saw R&J, and the interpretation of the play was so accessible and modern-seeming. Erika Soto, who played Juliet, really nailed the attitude and thoughts of a young, infatuated, teen girl. I am exited to see MAAN. This is my favorite theater company. They always bring a new and refreshing point of view to classic plays. Don't miss them! Performances are ostensibly free, but they ask for donations. Support public theater! Come at least an hour early to get a good seat with your blanket or lawn chairs and eat your picnic dinner.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RabbiWendy
50,Great evening with free Shakespeare in the Park,"The Taming of the Shrew performance and set was well done. I had read reviews and decided to add this to our LA itinerary. The performance location is a bit hard to find - not well marked from where we entered the park but then we saw signs as we got closer. We parked in Lot 2 and walked up an incline to the location - not scary steep but could be hard for those with mobility issues. The area closest to the stage is ""blanket-only"", further back beach chairs and other higher collapsible chairs are permitted. Some snacks and beverages are available for purchase. Many other audience members brought in dinners and snacks. Restrooms are available near the stage so you don't have to go back down the hill to the parking lot. I'd recommend bringing warmer clothes to layer as the sun goes down. A flashlight is helpful on the walk back down the hill after the performance. Some lights are placed along the path but some areas are rather dark. Highly recommend this for couples and families with teens.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FireflyPR
40,Bravo ISC!,"Shakespeare in the park: what could be a better way to pass a warm summer evening? This time of the year, Los Angeles' Independent Shakespeare Co. provides just that, offering free-to-the-public productions in Griffith Park's Old Zoo, a short walk from Parking Lot Number 2. Finding the location can seem a bit challenging so be sure to see the directions in ISC's own web site. There's a minor uphill trudge from parking to the performance site and though portable lighting marks the way downhill at night, you may wish to bring your own flashlight if you don't see well in the dark. Note also that apart from the picnic tables which are situated pretty far from the stage, there is no seating in the theatre. Instead, you'll be camped out on the grass. Those seated in areas close to the stage are recommended to bring blankets; in the areas farther from the stage, you're allowed folding chairs or camp seats. Since I've had back issues, I was a bit concerned that I wasn't allowed to use one of those beach chairs which sit very low to the ground since I was sitting up front; fortunately, I was perfectly OK to lounge on our blanket, shifting position as necessary. Also bear in mind that it can get chilly once the sun goes down and a breeze comes up, so you may wish to bring a jacket. And though there are nibbles and water provided at concession stands, you also have the option of picnicking in the theatre as long as you don't include alcoholic beverages. Both performance and parking are free; but you'll be encouraged to make donations if all all possible.The performance itself was a rollicking, slapsticky version of Taming of the Shrew brought into a contemporary setting. Artistic license is taken with regard to staging and tweaks here and there to dialog, the result being part Monty Python, part Marx Bros, complete with roller skating, musical interludes, seltzer water, food fights, Spanish dialogue, interaction with the audience, a great deal of scenery chewing, sexual innuendo, a refreshingly different take on Bianca and Petruchio as I'm fairly sure you've never seen him before. (That I will save as a surprise.) For fans of Shakespeare or otherwise, it's impossible not to enjoy this production. All of it is great fun, good acting, lots of laughs-- and there's something indisputably wonderful about lounging on a blanket in Griffith Park, knowing you're in the middle of city with more than 3 3/4 million people, yet feeling you're apart from it all in this lovely hillside setting.Do these guys a favor and donate what you can when you're given the opportunity. This is an entertainment tradition which needs to continue.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gailg306
50,Shakespeare for everyone!,"This was our second season of outdoor performances and we love attending! It's relaxed, we eat and have a wonderful time. The performances are always top notch and nothing tops Shakespeare. I brought my Grandkids to one of the cedies and they were enthralled. It's also an excellent date night. I'm looking forward to next season and possibly attending some of the studio performances.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HappyCamper856
50,Best Shakespeare company in so Cal.,"Consistently amazing performances. Always true to the text, but accessible to the masses. Fresh insights to classic treasures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/princessleah515
