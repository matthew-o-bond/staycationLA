40,Lambert Park in El Monte,This is a small but very cool park where locals gather for all kinds of activities that range from just walking the dog to grilling on weekends. You could also come to vote during the voting days,David B

20,"Nothing special at this local park, it is a bit run down","This park has seen better days, it is in a rather depressed neighborhood. It is not a park I would let me wife walk around by herself either. It is not dirty but there is really nothing to see but grass and a few trees. Your better off going up the street a few miles to Peck Road park where there is a lake and ducks to feed (remodeled facilities too).",Avg_M8
40,Nice Place to Watch Baseball,"We visited Lambert Park to watch an All-Star Little League baseball game. Although the field itself was a challenge for the players because it was a bit uneven and not particularly well cared for, the park itself was good for spectators due to adequate parking, adequate stands and easy access to restrooms.",Debra-Lynne T
50,"Lambert Park - Fun Park For Sports, Playgrounds, Picnics and a Nice Community Center","We have enjoyed going to Lambert Park and having a picnic several times. There is a nice view from there of Mt. Baldy.There is a playground area, sprots fields, and an indoor sports facility. There is a large community building that has an auditorium, meeting rooms, and a kitchen.There are sports leagues here. Even if vistiing, its fun to watch the little laaguers play. They are good and this year (2015) made it into the AAA Championship Game.It is next door to Frank Lloyd Wright School so the park is a popular one for neighborhood families.",mini
