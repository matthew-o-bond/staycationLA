10,Horrible first aid sad animals,"I had a problem with was the first aid. No sense of urgency. Took 20 mins for him to report to the first aid station and the park wasn't even opened two hours. My wife had sprayed some sunscreen in her eyes and was in pain. instead of having anything such as disposable eye drops, she was given a used bottle of visine from his fanny pack and told to spray her eyes. She was blinded and dropped it. The first aid person was annoyed and said it was still clean and to use it anyways. We were so pissed we vowed never to step foot in this park again. My wife left in tears in physical discomfort. Yes we did walk around the park. The animals overall were not engaging and suffocating for such a large location. This was not world class. The Oakland and SF zoos are so much more welcoming and less confining. When a spider monkey and a bear wave at you or a camel walk next to you. Then that's a sign of a happy zoo. These animals felt like they were in captivity. Your seal show was a bust. The seal refused to come to the trainer and when he did he promptly went back under the water.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robertu838
50,Zoo keeps getting better with age,Zoo keeps improving year after year. Cleaner and cleaner and the people who work there really love and care about animals. We did the Mingle with Flamingo and it was so worth it. They only have 4 a day so book early! We loved it. We also fed the giraffes and that’s fun and up close. They are still making it better each year and we love seeing the changes.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lb33wonka
50,Lovely day at the zoo!,Took the kids to the zoo for my birthday. They enjoyed the scavenger hunt. We are from out of town and were able to get in half price with our local zoo membership.Several school groups. Beautiful zoo for walking. My only complaint is that most of the food stands were closed. It was a weekday and most people appeared to pack lunch.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BargainTraveler2432
10,rude employees after i got into an accident NOT FAMILY FRIENDLY AT ALL,"on my way to the zoo i got into a very bad car accident. i was planning on going back to the zoo to use my tickets but since my car was totaled and i mentally do not want to drive in that area anytime soon i contacted the zoo & tried to get my money back and was very rudely talked to by several employees stating even though my car is now totaled, with my boyfriend and myself having injuries, i can not get a refund. they rudely told me that it wasn’t “there fault” i got into the crash and that there was “nothing they could do for me” even in my harsh situation. i thought the zoo was a friendly environment but i guess not, never will i be going back to this zoo",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rogersbear
40,Great day at the zoo,"Great day out. The zoo is well maintained and there are lots of fun things to do! Reasonable price (but unlike London zoo, they do charge for under 3’s).There is a mixture of indoor and outdoor spaces to explore. There is not a specific play area for children that we found. There was a lack of choice for food options. The food could be improved. Different dietary options (gluten free and lactose free not accommodated) and healthy kids options needed (mostly chips and fried chicken sold). Overall a great day out!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sharonwa
50,Zoological Oasis in L. A.,"Quick trip to the zoo with a two year old and stroller.... my first visit. I was amazed at how it is laid out on a hillside... the tropical foliage is refreshing in the midst of all the freeways... Animals appear well cared for and their enclosures make it easy for us to watch them moving around. We rode the carousel - an extra cost - but our two year old and us enjoyed it. The river otter exhibit was really fun - we watched the otters slide down water slides and right up against the glass. We pushed to the top to get to the playground area which our 2 year old loved. the park was closing as we left, and we heard a roaring lion, and saw a zebra literally ""book"" it across the field making a loud braying sound. A huge black bear lounged on a high rock, soaking up the last rays of the sun. Come prepared to walk, wear comfortable shoes and bring a water bottle. Several great places to eat and you can pack a lunch and bring it in too .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kittenreindeer
40,Nice - however I need to go 3 more times to get the value of a years pass - hard.,I liked the Deer Pig - just trying to get a good photo shoot on some - won't need to do that again. Great place to walk and get some exercise. That will be my and my ladies aim on later visits.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TiredTravelerinpain
40,Not the old asphalt paths and cages of 30 years ago.,"You wander through lanes lined with botanical trees and shrubs to enclosures or buildings for the various animals. Most are their native habitat. There are usually things for the animals to do or play with in their enclosures and room to roam. I didn't see any animals pacing. We went on a cool and windy day, and the parrots were huddled by the heat lamp, and some monkeys were keeping each other warm. Good supply of animals, pleasant viewing. Very hilly, so if you're not good at walking, rent one of the manual or electric wheel chairs. My husband tired quickly, and so we only spent about 2 hours, but could have doubled that. There is a tram.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SLSBrown
50,La Zoo Lights,"This was a great evening, queue was lengthy, however once inside it was a great experience. Highly recommend seeing this if you in LA over Christmas. Don’t expect to see any animals as such though, you can enter the lizard/snake area but that about it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HBrent77
50,A day at the zoo.,Great time to go when the weather is cooler. Saw the Lions and Tiger being active and roaring. Most animals were awake.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mrbarabasch
40,Plan a whole day for this!,For the size of the zoo the price is super reasonable. My boyfriend and I came here thinking we could get through the whole park within a few hours and boy were we wrong! We rushed through it and did it in a few hours. If we actually took our time it would have taken pretty much a solid day. Depending on the time of year there may not be all animals to see. The food prices are very expensive so eat before hand and bring food if you can. The parking is free!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kickinitwithkyla
50,LA Zoo Lights,Absolutely beautiful and definitely not to be missed. The zoo was decorated with stunning lights and is only at xmas time so put it in your diary for next year. Just magical.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dontdreamitdoit
40,Lots to see,"We spent a good amount of time here, there are lots of animals to see and good variation.They rent out buggies/strollers so that kids that dont like much walking will be able to get around easier.There is a play park within too which was great for our 4year old.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bumbleandthemog
10,So Sad.,"It was really sad and depressing to see the Animal Habitats - way too small and confined and not natural. No space, no natural environment for the animals. They all looked depressed and unhealthy. It should be closed and the animals repatriated to better Zoos like Sydney or Calgary... I have only been to a few Zoos and maybe they were top 5 in the world because this was really sad and depressing for the creatures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seanmcb007
40,"Decent, worth a visit if in LA",Overall the place is fine. It doesn't wow nor is it a dump either. I think I'm spoiled with some of the other zoos I have visited. But no real regrets going either.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bodilys
50,Amazing LA ZOO LIGHTS.,Do not miss the ZOO lights at LA zoo. Just beautiful and magical. A great place for kids and adults. Be sure to go through the twinkle tunnel. We have been wanting to go and last night we finally did it. So happy we did!!!!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bethlinda
50,LA ZOO Lights was amazing during the holidays.,"I bought tickets online and used it to cap our 2019 Christmas Day YouTube Special, so you can see the what we saw by watching our video. There were many light displays and opportunities to dazzle your senses. I took my wife and surprised us both. Watch the video on YouTube video # nHl0Yj539yo",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Louinator59
40,Zoo Holiday Lights Shine Bright,"Took the family and went to the LA Zoo Holiday Lights. The zoo grounds are extensively decked out with all kinds of lights-bright white butterflies, illuminated animals, water show, light tunnel-and, while the animals aren’t out, you can walk through a lot of the areas. It’s a great holiday activity for any ages. Only negative were the crowds. There were a lot of people through which to maneuver.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jilltarinw
30,Zoo Lights Event Underwhelms,"Foremost, be warned that with the exception of the Reptile House, there are no live animals on display (though we did see a rat). This is made extremely clear once you’re on-site, but is virtually unmentioned when buying tickets online.The core issue is that the event lacks any sense of artistry- mostly just off the shelf light products for the sake of lighting with no mind paid to the inherent power of the zoo’s brand equity.Something along the lines of the Singapore Zoo’s Lumina event would be much more appropriate- an experience above and beyond a high-end neighborhood display that taps into the romance of being in a zoo at nighttime.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FrequentFlyer1165
50,Lots to do,"This is not a one day attraction. It will take several visits to fully absorb everything that is here. The keepers are very friendly and willing to share their knowledge. There is an impressive amount of animals at the zoo and it is impossible to see them all in one visit. The zoo is slightly controversial and usually there are protesters outside, but the staff does the best they can with what they have.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/748geoffp
40,Great place to connect with nature,"This is a beautiful sanctuary in the middle of Los Angeles. Is very easy to get there from any part of the city and they offer free parking. Once you are inside the zoo, you forget about everything. They have a lot of flamingos and for few dollars you can also interact with them. The giraffes are so friendly and so adorable. For $5 they will allow you to feed them and the kids love that. The gorillas are so incredible.I visited this zoo many times and I can tell you those gorillas are really smart.I saw them interact with people so many times and they have such a strong personality. It is fun just to watch them.My favorite are the chimpanzees. They are so funny. The older chimpanzees just stay calm and don't do much. The babies are playful and they always put a show. You will also see Lions,seals, Koala, zebras, crocodiles, birds, snakes, elephants, tiger, rhinoceros and a lot more. There is also an ice cream stand and a small restaurant that sells pizza , fries and chicken nuggets",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michellec747
40,pleasant and interesting,"this is a major reason to visit Griffith Park. The zoo is large and has very pleasant grounds. weekends, there are special exhibits and shows, in particular one on Condors. a variety of restaurants, and food is good overall. staff are friendly. it is a good place to learn about wildlife. not the ""splashiest"" of zoos (San Diego), but still worthwhile.If you tire from walking, across the zoo drive is the Autry Museum, also worthwhile. on the North side of the park is Travel Town, with exhibits of railroad equipment. The Observatory is on the south side of the park at some distance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/812jeffreyk
40,Good zoo,"Nice size zoo (got my steps in today!). Well laid out. Many animals in natural looking exhibits. A bit hilly, but there is a perimeter tram available. Lots of dining options. See the baby giraffe. Loved the meerkats and giant river otters. Ride the conservation carousel; so many different animals on it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnnElizabeth97123
50,Splashy holiday Lights for the kids,This is a very unique holiday family activity. It runs Nov 15 - Jan 5 (the holidays) from 6pm to 10pm. We bought our tickets on line ($13/ adult for nonmembers). So we saved some time. We got there at just before 6pm and there was a long entrance line which moved quickly. There are great photo opportunities throughout the walk. We first got something to eat after the entrance light display which has various vendors near the eatery. The only visible animals were in The Lair which is for reptiles and amphibians. Our walk ended at the Asian Elephants which is creative display but not real elephants. There is also a regular water laser show which the kids will like.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spiritwheels
10,Los Angeles Zoo Lights,Los Angeles Zoo has holiday Christmas Lights. The trees are lit up with lights. Some props/picture boards of animals framed with lights. There is approximately 5 min water light show. Water splashing around accompanied with Christmas music. No animals. All closed off. Seemed like the park was shrunk in size an a small area was sectioned off with lights. Not worth coming. Do not waste your time. I highly suggest visiting the Los Angeles Arboretum Lantern Light Festival. Much prettier lots more lights. Of course price is higher. Could be less. Anyway better than zoo. I was disappointed and it wasnt fun at all!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pamae1
50,Family fun,The exhibits were great. The cleanliness was better than expected and the animals were on full display. It was a great time,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/diegorC279SK
40,Fun day out,"Despite the huge crowds my family had a blast at the LA Zoo! The animals, the carousel $3pp, this place knows how to entertain. Parking was impossible so we opted for the preferred option at $10 per car.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bwbwbwbw
40,Nice zoo,This is a nice zoo if you are in Los Angeles. It is smaller and with fewer animals than other zoos but the entrance is cheaper so it is something you should expect. We liked it and it is a really nice half day visit but they might do a little better in my opinion. Bonus point great free parking and easy to reach with the car.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F-F-7676
40,Very nice zoo,"We arrived soon after opening on a Saturday. It wasn’t overly crowded nor too busy. We just walked in with our tickets (we pre-purchased them online).The exhibits are good, lots of different animals, some were easy to spot while other were more hidden away. But zoo keepers were around to share information on the animals. The Komodo dragon was definitely an animal of interest for our son and daughter.It was a pretty hot day. As others have remarked, there are lots of trees and shaded areas along the whole walkway and plenty of benches for seating. And there are various restaurants and places to eat scattered around the whole zoo. The burger and chicken sandwich were okay. The churro Sunday is really good. Pricing is a little steep, but hopefully it’s helping the zoo care for its animals.There is a kids play area with a good sized jungle gym. It’s fully covered so the kids aren’t getting cooked by the sun. And they have a misting station to fully allow the kids to cool off (or play in the mist/water).Overall it is a very nice zoo. For the price it’s worth it, and the kids had a blast. We spent almost 5 hours and didn’t see everything - but took enough time to enjoy the exhibits we did stop at. We will come again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dinfamily2009
50,Great Day to Visit,"My teenage daughter and I visited this zoo last weekend. We paid for parking ($10 cash) to get closer to the entrance (even though we knew we'd be doing a lot of walking). It got up to 85 degrees while there, but there is plenty of shady areas and benches to rest as well as places to get drinks. The enclosures for the animals were nice, and overall the zoo was very clean and aesthetically pleasing (as my daughter said, haha). They offer some special things you will find on their website such as visits with animals (flamingos being one) and a trolley that takes you around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeslieinTN
50,Great zoo,"Really liked this zoo because it wasn’t massive like San Diego Zoo and wasn’t a small zoo either. Perfect size. We opted to walk rather than use the shuttle, but near the end when legs are getting tired, the shuttle didn’t sound like a bad idea. Lots of animals active, lots of trees and shady areas. Didn’t buy any food. Got a military discount. They also offer AAA discounts of $2.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1julieg
50,So much to see,Very well laid out and so much to see animals and forna. It was a very hot day when we visited but the zoo had plenty of places to get refreshments. Quite a bit of walking but well worth it. The animals were obviously treasured and looked content and relaxedFairly priced well worth a visit make sure you have good foot wear on,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ventoraisle
50,Easy to walk with young kids.,"Visiting zoo is one of top wish list from my 9 years daughters, but we need start early because surviving from hot temperatures has first priority. Comparing other zoo in CA, this place design is much better than other’s. So many huge tree make enough shade all of walk way in this park. Always, they built lamp. That is why wheel chair elderly people also enjoy to explore this park. Shuttle bus is available with pay ticket. Restaurant quality is pretty good. Pay $10 parking locates in front of the zoo. Free parking also available. 1.5 hours from LAX by car depend on traffic. Bring own hat and sunscreen recommend. You can purchase ticket ahead of time from website. Groupon also has discount ticket.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ayakoi619
20,New zoo or not-as-old zoo?,"We tend to visit a zoo most places we go, but this zoo didn't compare well to others we've seen. We didn't go to the Old LA Zoo, but considering how outdated the ""new"" zoo feels I can only wonder what the old zoo looks like. This is the only zoo where we've been able to constantly smell animal waste out in the open throughout the zoo.The otters seemed to have fun in their enclosure, and there were a couple of species we hadn't seen before.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travisjloh
40,Fantastic Zoo,"I have to say, this zoo has been one of the best zoo's I have ever been to (and I've visited a few), we visited on a really hot day but there are plenty of places dotted around where you can take refuge from the sun.A lot of the animals were obviously feeling the heat but I did notice that their cages had plenty of facilities where they could take refuge to and they all seem pretty happy and their areas are very spacious.My favourite were the Gorillas, Chimps and Elephants but there are so many different animals here, I made friends with one of the female Gorilla's because I was blowing her kisses and she started to mimic me, that was amazing. It's a fab fun day out for all the family, the welfare of the animals seem excellent to so great day out.The only negative I would give is that they sell bottled water at $4 a piece, no, no, no, this is not good enough, your are taking advantage of people!! That's why I have not given them 5 stars on this occasion.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheNatster75
30,Snow leopard,"We enjoyed our visit here, it was great to be able to feed Philip the Giraffe however I was concerned for the welfare of some of the animals in particular the snow leopard, the snow leopard seemed stressed and it was a really hot day it was 34°C he was clinging to the rock panting quite heavily it wasn’t nice to see.I understand zoos are necessary for conservation and to protect endangered animals but perhaps the Zoo In Los Angeles isn’t the best home for a snow leopard.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/matthewsanderson1703
40,Come see the animals @ the Zoo!,"It may not be as well renowned as the San Diego Zoo but the L.A. Zoo is worth a look. You can even save a couple bucks w/your AAA card or a $2 off coupon in a brochure such as those found in pamphlets at hotels. There is no charge for parking. At the zoo, you can pet goats in the children's section. They have many animals here such as giraffes, elephants, flamingos, ostriches & hyenas. They do tell you because the place closes at 5 P.M. that they start to put the animals away an hr. earlier so get there early so you have plenty of time to see everything you desire. Also be aware in the summer it can get hot so the animals will want to keep cool (and so will you!); it was 104 that day-you'll need something to quench your thirst.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/locke869
50,Such a great outing!,It was our first time going to the LA Zoo and we're from LA. With our AAA discount it was reasonably priced and the food inside was good and not expensive. The staff was exceptionally kind and helpful.Wear comfortable tennis shoes bring water and a hat.Oh and the animals were great too😄!! Go first thing in the morning before the animals take a nap.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kwZ8587KL
50,Nice time at the Zoo,"My daughter and I have unforgettable fun that sparks a passion for wild animals.The Zoo is a place for many endangered animals, birds, amphibians, reptiles and plants of different species.As a tourist, I highly recommend it for families and friends visiting LA.Definitely we will come back again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/abdullahaD3246HP
30,An Ok Zoo,"I visited the zoo in the month of August. Plenty of people came, families with young babies, toddlers and children. It's always to hear the delight of the children seeing the animals. There were several staffs standing to greet the people or maybe help other people take pictures.The map given to me was easy to follow The first stop was the pink pelicans. So pretty to look out. I did try to get to the elephants but was disappointed not to see any elephants. I did see the jaguar, hippos, and different type of birds. There was one place where the birds were nesting as there was a sign to be quiet, however, the keepers of that cage were talking loudly.I'm also disappointed not to see the animals in the cages (I'm not sure if the animals were hiding or they are not part of the exhibit). So sad. There are staff all over the place, so if you have a question, you can stop them. Also, there is a guy who is the security guard riding on his bike. At least it is a clean place. I came here to practice using my new camera. I had some good shots. Overall, this zoo is not a zoo that I can say ""wow"", but it was an ok place to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annminky
40,A Fun Afternoon,"We spent four hours at the LA Zoo, were able to see all the exhibits, and watched the bird show. We found the zoo to be very walkable. The map was a little confusing, but we managed. They have a little activity where you look for special signs and mark a pamphlet. For completing it we were able to get a notebook and a reusable shopping bag at the end of our visit. The bird show was very good, but as a note of criticism, they really, really need to stop people from entering after it starts. We had people crowding in and walking in front of us even up to 5 minutes before the show was over. I've been to other zoos where they close the gate and no one is admitted after a show starts, which is nice for the patrons and safer for the animals.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Go2theZoo
50,Vacation,I spent a couple of hours during the zoo. This it was well-kept and clean. Lots of animals it was a brilliant day. Hot but not crowded we saw a lot of. . The upkeep is great,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paws0810
50,L.A Zoo,"I happened to enjoy an afternoon visit with my husband for the first time to the L. A. Zoo. My husband was supper thrilled. What I like most is the walking. They had a lot of places for people to rest and eat. There was going to be an activity for the night which they said it happens once a year. We spent 4 hours visiting almost all the animals. It is a place to visit for families, especially with children.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Storyteller268013
50,The underdog story of the LA Zoo,"As an Angelino, I grew up going to the LA Zoo since I was about 4. With the new improved areas like Rainforest of the Americas, it’s easy to fall in love with this place. Although there are some areas that do need improvement as well which with the new Vision Plan indicates a radically different zoo in the next 20 years, it’s still what I consider my home away from home. A good tip is to definitely go in at opening time if you wanna see active animals like big cats, I’m in love with the majestic jaguars 😔❤️",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/juliocB3247MG
50,The L.A. Zoo,"It was a very good visit the zoo has made upgrades not only for its visitors but for the animals in their captivity, they seem to be well cared for and most of their facilitys are clean as well as the park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Guates
30,Zoo is small enough to see in a relaxed way even with children,"Enjoyed much of the Zoo and for most of the time our children were very happy. Saw and heard a Male Lion Roaring, the otters eating and playing, an elephant playing with water and such.. People not paying attention to their children who were purposely blocking the view of others while playing on their cell phones was annoying, but that is not the Zoo's fault. Most of the food places were closed, and there seemed to be few people at the Zoo, so maybe low usage/revenue is impacting some things and empty exhibits. Negative item is the Zoo seemed to pull animals and put them away early (before Zoo closed). Our children were really excited to see many animals, but when they got to the Giraffe enclosure more than 30 minutes before the Zoo closed, the Giraffes had already been removed to another location. We understand things like it is hard to see many animals in the heat of the day, but when it finally cooled off, just before closing, removing the animals from view seems inconsiderate.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z2134VDjonathanl
40,Fun day out,Fun day out to feel like you've gotten out of the city. So much lush landscaping it just makes it very enjoyable to walk around the park. It's a lot cleaner than I remember,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/socalguy7979
40,Great Way to spend Time with Grandson,"Finding an activity that will please two different aged boys is not always easy. The LA Zoo is a perfect answer. WE have visited this place before and this trip was also a great time. There are so many exhibits that both boys ( ages 10-13) were happy.No great food, but adequate to fill you for lunch. Not certain which attraction was best, but the zoo has made many improvements since our last visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mitchw926
40,Check out LA ZOO Lights During November to Christmas!,"L.A. Zoo Lights attracts native Angelenos and visitors to experience an illuminated evening of more than a million and a half lights.

50,Great zoo to visit!,"We always try to visit a zoo while on vacation. We got there in good time from our hotel and parking was easy (and free). It was a very hot day, so once we got inside (and had pictures taken) we got some cool treats. Most of the animals were out to see, and hear! We had booked a hippo encounter and we weren’t disappointed! We learned a lot and it was an amazing experience. We also heard it was their last encounter. We were lucky we booked when we did. Their shaved ice is good too. After walking around some more, we also did the flamingo mingle. That was also very fun. We highly recommend doing it if you get the chance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R5453RXmichelles
10,Aren’t zoos suppose to have animals?,I’ve never been to a zoo that most cafes had no animals in them or were under renovation. We paid a lot of money to basically take a walk.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danunz22
40,Good but LA could do better,"It was a very enjoyable day to wander around and see the zoo and gardens. We wandered a bit more than planned since the signage is not very good - especially for the show venues.There is a wide variety of species to admire and the educational opportunity is great for kids and adults alike. The deferred maintenance is obvious and adding up. Food selection is average - and very expensive - but they don't seem to mind if you bring food and drink inside, so kudos to them for accommodating the budget conscious families. Parking is good (free is VERY good) - although the traffic management was horrid as they only allowed one exit and it took forever just to get around to the other side of the parking lot where the other exit was closed.The staff was friendly and helpful and no regrets for spending the day there. Would recommend for first timers and family outings.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AKTraveler2012
40,Nice zoo in the middle of the city,"I was I originally dreading coming to this zoo, because we’ve been to San Diego and Columbus Zoo, but I would say I was pleasantly surprised.Pros-Free parking-clean and had roaming security.-animals looks well taken care off-has opportunities for backstage and feeding tours-two large gift shops at the front-bathrooms were clean-price was reasonableCons-A lot of kids the day I was there - summer camps made it loud and crowded.- long lines to get tickets.- not enough seating at the food areas.- there were several food places closed, despite being a very busy day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cape51

20,Sad,The good...layout and walk around Zoo is lovely and staff helpful.The bad...Not enough space for animals to roam. Zebras/the wolf curled up alone and the gorilla especially saddened me. People were yelling and whistling at the animals trying to wake them for selfies....sickening and made me angry. If we need to protect these animals then make their space homely and ensure they have company of others. The maned wolf all alone in small area walking the same worn track over and over. Quite depressing watching TBH.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/200julesw

40,LA Zoo trip,"It was beautiful but make sure you check the weather the day you plan on going. Sun hat are a great idea and water bottles. The earlier the better. Dont go when it 90 degrees 🌞🌞🌞 unless you dress light and can handle the heat. The animals werr amazing but the heat had most of them in shade or sleeping, well at least the main ones like the bear, tiger, gorillas, and lions, but my kids loved it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Avilastravles
50,Always a good time,"As an LA county resident, I’ve grown up coming to the zoo and always loved it. This trip was no different. It was quite hot out (90 F) which I think deterred a lot of people. It wasn’t as crowded as I remember it usually being. With the heat, all of the food vendors seemed to get drinks out quickly to people which was nice. They also offer free ice and water!I happened to be at the chimp exhibit when they began feeding them. This was cool to see as it gave for unique photo opportunities. Try to time your visits to certain areas with their feeding schedules. I always forget to do this and next time I visit I’ll be planning the whole day around the various feedings.I spent 4 hours at the zoo and could have spent more but I forgot sunscreen and my shoulders were starting to sting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tiasharks
50,Big zoo with lots of large animals,"I wasn't planning on visiting the zoo on my trip to LA but we had a few hours to kill and when I looked on the website I was excited by the number of large animals they have. Not only are there elephants and giraffes but there were also hippos (I feel like I have only seen hippos in San Diego before, and I have been to a decent number of zoos). The exhibits were nice and the zoo was very enjoyable. We got an amazing view of hippos up close which made the whole trip for me!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HeidiWannaTravel
50,Memorial Weekend Visit,"Family of 5 attended the zoo. (5, 3 and 1). We bought our tickets while driving to the zoo via their website. Strongly recommend you take a snapshot from each ticket. The middle entrance is the only one that has a scanner. If you didn’t get the email or get the printout, have your confirmation number. Go to window 10 can help you print the passes. Although parking is free, you will have to walk farther. Parking closer costs $10—worth the money after walking all day. My plan is always to rush to the back and make my way to the front. May is good because it isn’t too hot. My little one got a splinter because there is a lot of wood fencing—-packing a tweezer is not a bad idea. Overall we had a great time. Park closes at 5 and it feels strange leaving with the sun still high in the sky.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Avatar2901
50,Great zoo,I really enjoyed this zoo simply because there were so many animals to see. The enclosures seemed like they were kept up and most of the animals seemed to have room to move around. This is a fairly large zoo so wear comfortable shoes as there is a lot of walking involved. The food prices were a little high but what zoo isn't? Also the zoo is in the hills so it will be a little steep and a little hot but overall this is a great place to visit if you're in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ryan3319
50,Great day out doors,"This is my second visit. Small enough to complete in half a day. When you want to be outside on a lovely day, it's a great way to spend walking, talking and enjoying the wildlife. My only complaint is that very few of the 'eateries' are open and snacks are from vending machines (at least during the week) so we eat first and bring our own water bottles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WWwalker
40,New fencing solves former negative review,"The LA Zoo has removed much of the shrubbery which blocked the view of visitors in stroller or wheelchairs. This zoo is in a lovely wooded and hilly area making the visit a nice walk as well as good settings for most of the animals. Allow 6 hours to see the entire zoo, but you can have a satisfactory visit in 3 hours if you skip some paths and exhibits. This zoo does not have any exhibits that are especially stunning or ""must see.""Signage still needs some tweaking where several paths diverge, but the map is pretty accurate. Decent food for lunch, but some restaurants are only open on the weekend. The staff at the front of the zoo do not always have this info. Groundskeepers are usually ""in the know.""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/parrishh2013
40,Met Expectations,Overall it is well laid out with great exhibits of about all of what animals you’d expect in a zoo. There is a cost of over $15 for adults. Generally clean and friendly zoo associates. Wished it closed later say at 6 or 7 pm in summer months. Parking is free. Allow 3 hours.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/460terryb
50,A fun experience,We are from San Diego and have pretty high expectations of a zoo. LA Zoo exceeded them. It is more compact than SD and the collection is not as extensive. The displays are more intimate and we got the feeling we were closer to the animals. I am a photographer and there were fewer barriers or fences to shoot though. Being half the price of SD is also a big plus. We will return when we have more time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sampingo
50,LOTS OF WALKING! Plan a full day!,Zoo is located on large park lands - beautifully maintained and away from the city. Lots of walking- we only stayed 3 hours because we went to feed giraffes (amazing!)- but you definitely need an entire day to see and experience everything. Well-marked maps and signs. Plenty of bathrooms. Several food options throughout the park. Gift shop has many items and variety of prices so kids can pick souvenirs without spending a ton. Toddler and pre-teens enjoyed it the same! Definitely worth seeing a feeding or experiencing a hands-on feeding— highlight of the trip for everyone!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pinkbootsinparis
10,Don’t waste your money!,"Don’t waste your money, or your time! We went today with our 3 young children, we couldn’t buy milk at a single restaurant or refreshment stand. The map was horrible! There weren’t very many animals. The plants make it difficult for children to see into the habitats on the did have animals. They have program for the kids to participate in to get a prize. The prize was a luggage tag, seriously? What kid wants a luggage tag?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F1079EGjanb
50,Was Told to Turn Back,Arrived at 3pm to be told by the ticketing agent to turn back and we would be better off coming another day. Its a mild Tuesday afternoon and the crowds seemed quiet. I said we would risk it and he honestly seemed upset we were choosing to go in stating all the animals are put away at 4pm. If the animals are put away at four why not close at four??? Two early thirty couples jetted around that zoo and saw everythingggg... if you aren’t weighed down by kids and strollers its totally doable. Started off towards the left made a full loop saw the elephants and giraffes and tigers playing in oversized boxes. After walking around for two hours we were looping back and got to see the lions who I think had just fed actually up and roaming around and coughing and talking to one another. It was a GREAT two hours and shame on that ticket guy for trying to talk us out of it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/witchyandbitchy
50,Still a great place to visit with your friends and family of all ages!,"We visited on the first sunny Sunday the area had seen in a week. Needless to say, it was CROWDED! Used the preferential parking (worth it – but not necessary). Take sunscreen, a hat (lots of direct sunlight), and a water bottle to refill. I could not find any sunscreen for sale, and the hats inside the zoo gates were about $20.The exhibits were well maintained, and the facilities were presentable. Paid the extra $5 to feed the giraffes. Get in line 15 minutes before feeding time to avoid the crowd – in other words, be the first in line! Very entertaining to see just how tall they really are in comparison to us. Elephants hid the whole day, but the variety of monkeys were spectacular and totally entertaining. We visited every single exhibit that was open, so it was well worth the money and was a great way to spend time with the family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danam582
50,Well for 3 people it was $70,"This Zoo in LA is great and it's even better in December because at night they open the zoo from like 6pm-9pm and I think you can find discount for the actually zoo during the day. Christmas time with Christmas lights around the exhibits and everything from the trees, sky, and canopies they created lights up. Its alot of walking only it's in the dark and can't really see any animals but it's all the bright Christmas lights and sculpture exhibits through out the park. Its probably a big rectangle of lights and art decoration Best Christmas lights in a zoo for the holidays. And also I have been there during the day as way when you tour the entire zoo full of animals that are so cool to experience within this park. Miles of walking but worth the price. Great for kids and adults for Christmas or anytime.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Belliago37
50,Great for Families,Well laid out with a nice variety of animals. Enclosures were large and seemed appropriate for the animals. Ate at the Gorilla Grill. Small selection of sandwiches but made to order burgers. Kids enjoyed the trip.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarylandNana4
40,Perfect Family Activity,We visited in March 2019. Weather was great and it was somewhat crowded. We covered the zoo in about 4 hours. We were able to see many of the animals eating during our visit.We couldn’t believe how close we could get to the elephants and the giraffes. Go you won’t be disappointed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/651kevinj
50,Loved the zoo!,"Great zoo with lots of cool animals to see. Not the quickest place to get to and from on transit, especially on a Sunday...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ves2011
40,Great zoo!,"We spent a full day at the zoo, exploring every nook and cranny, and enjoyed it very much! This is a lovely zoo that’s enhanced by the botanical gardens throughout. We particularly enjoyed the impressive reptile and amphibian exhibits in the LAIR - a highlight of this zoo in our opinion. Being from the east coast we enjoyed seeing animals that live on the west coast that aren’t often at our zoos back home. Great option for a fun family day in LA. Easy to find, lots of free parking and also close to Griffith Observatory which offers tremendous views of LA and the Hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jodi307
40,Afternoon at the Zoo,"Spent the day at the Los Angeles Zoo. Parking and ticketing was a breeze. Employees and volunteers were great, but were difficult to find when in need of help with exact directions to specific enclosures. Some of the restaurants were closed, but the one we found open that we ate at was clean and the food delicious. The gardens are beautiful. It's a great Zoo. Be sure to visit the Orangatans and say hello to Bruno for us!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Elizabeethan
10,Love the zoo but beware of tram driver,"We love the zoo and purchase memberships for our extended family and ourselves every year.This review is for the tram driver from today’s ride. Someone called ‘captain’ Richard.We were waiting for the tram at one of the stops, there was an elderly gentleman with his grandson and another younger dad with his daughter. They were both trying to get their respective children to get out of the way of the tram. They managed to pull the children aside but the driver of the tram wasn’t happy about it and he showed it by trying to nudge them towards the wall.. with the tram. The gentlemen were holding the children and the tram kept coming at them until there were literally only a few inches between them.I can only imagine the kind of legal troubles this driver would have gotten the Zoo involved had he made an additional tiny maneuver and injured the adults and their children.As soon as the driver parked, he got up and yelled at them saying ‘why you wanna be there, uh?’I did think his outburst was a little over the top but just kept my mouth shut.Soon after, the young dad with the daughter approached the driver and explained that it wasn’t his intention to get in the way but the daughter wasn’t cooperating. The driver again complained loudly about people not getting out of the way at which point I had to tell him to calm down. He just got more agitated. I had to point out how unprofessional and disrespectful he was. There are a lot of senior citizens and children at the zoo and stuff like this happens. He kept yelling about this and that and finally told us to leave ‘his’ tram. When we refused, he turned off the engine and sat there. He told us to get a refund, after all ‘it’s not my money’ he said. This altercation ended by everybody getting off the tram.I understand that dealing with this many people everyday cannot be easy. However there are better and more professional ways to deal with situations like this. I’ve thought that maybe the training the zoo offers to its drivers is not sufficient but then again, I remember there were really kind drivers as well on previous rides so my only conclusion is that this individual is in the wrong line of work. Definitely should stay away from working with people. And the Zoo should be aware of it as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Guide97742
40,Nice zoo for the price,This zoo seems well kept and they are working on some enclosures. There were plenty of animals to see. No out of the ordinary animals. Some of the enclosures for the birds allowed for some close encounters. Over all the staff and volunteers were friendly. Plan on spending about 3 hours. It did not feel crowded and we went on a Saturday. Was worth the price of admission.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mnako
30,Nice but San Diego zoo it is mot,I guess living in San Diego for many years you get spoiled with a world class zoo but with a large metropolitan city like LA you’d figured that they’d have a better facility (the Columbus Ohio zoo is better and it’s a much smaller city).Pretty easy walking. The uphill portions aren’t extreme but are enough to give you some good exercise. The map is useful and signage is plenty. There are lots of dining options and the prices aren’t crazy high (pretty reasonable as compared to out in town).The sight lines for small kids aren’t good (mine are 5 and tall and often had difficulties seeing over fences). Overall everything could use some updating.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bulldog92
40,Lots of animals,"We weren't sure what to expect, but were pleasantly surprise to find a very nice zoo. Lots of active animals to view, but nothing exceptional or special from other zoos we've been able to visit. The property is very hilly, so be sure to take that into account when picking your outfit/footwear.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jknechtly
30,A Nice Place,"While the animals seem to be well tended, the facility seems to be aged especially when compared to places such as the Bronx Zoo in NY or the San Diego Zoo. It is a fine place to spend several hours if you enjoy zoos. Some other zoos do much more in setting the living environments to be more authentic than what I saw here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/247barryr
40,Feeding time at the zoo,"We arrived at opening time 10 am on a Monday. Best time to go. Not many people there yet and after our lunch, it was perfect time to see the hippos eating.We got to see them feeding the chimpanzees.They throw vegetables and fruits down and they catch it. They all come over and sit down in front of the zoo keepers and wait.Then the howling monkeys entertained us for a long time. Their howling can be heard 2 and a half miles away!Don’t miss the dippin dots ice cream on your way out! Great time was had by all!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MamaMia796
50,Adorable,The animals at this zoo are just adorable. I liked the monkeys and how playful they were. The flamingos are so pretty to look at. My daughter saw the zoo at night to see the light display. Her and her friend really liked it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ATJaweed
50,LA ZOO,"Very nice and beautiful place. Walk almost an hr around the zoo, saw a lot of animals from snake, tiger to hippo and many others animal. the parking and zoo areas was clean. plenty of restroom. foods are a little expensive. recommeded it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/srengl2018
20,What a run down zoo that was built on the side of a mountain,"Get ready to walk a lot at this zoo and be tired as the entire zoo was built on the side of a mountain and nothing is flat to walk on. Half the animal pens are empty, staff is very unfriendly, very dirty and not work going (even if they did not charge an admission price). It shows that this is being run by the local L.A. city government.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pdschweitzer
20,Dont waste your money. Pretty sad conditions.,Booked tickets online via their site and had booking confirmation which was not honoured at the gate. We then had to buy tickets again for 4 people - not happy as the response from management was basically bad luck. Seeing animals is pretty upsetting with poor enclosure conditions. Like most LA attractions it's all about the money and not about providing entertainment. Will go to Australia next time for the open zoo's.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kazh2019
30,A pleasant experience,Our family of 4 adults enjoyed our visit as we were able to see a selection of animals not native to our home country (Australia). Entry price is reasonable Access by public transport was disappointing We had to Uber from Hollywood. We always visit zoos when we travel the globe & this one was average. Some animals appeared stressed as they paced up & down the enclosures which were predominantly dirt based. Most of the animal talks are early morning & not repeated We stayed till closing 5pm & some animals had retreated to their dens as it was getting dark.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lordy39
40,Christmas lights awesome,"We visited the Zoo at night too see the Christmas show and ir was beautiful, the really work to have everything in the perfect place, the light are amazing, we spent hours in there, the security people is not very friendly but the rest of the zoo staff is.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/reviews506
40,Worthwhile but expected more,"In short, we were happy with our $21/person experience. We saw many animals, had good views and enjoyed the walk. We covered the whole zoo (no shows or botanical gardens) in a few hours. However, for the second largest city in the United States, I expect to be ""wowed"" a bit. I wasn't. It is not a ""top zoo,"" not in the country and not even in California. Again, though, I'm glad we went, and we enjoyed the experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jessepisors
40,A great time with the grandkids,"My wife and I took the two grandkids (2 yrs and 6 months) to see the animals and had a great time. The two year old loved feeding the giraffes. A bit costly charging $5 to give her 3 small tree twigs with some leaves on them though I think. We could have spent several more hours there, and the petting zoo at the end was a lot of fun for them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tb004
40,Beautiful animals,"All animals at the zoo looked well taking care of, they all were beautiful, amazing giraffes and zebras, they have enough space for themselves. Feeding the giraffes is a unique experience.On the other hand I think food was pricy and not good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andregmera
50,Zoo Lights NYE party,"We visited Pasadena for the Parade of Roses and was looking for a family friendly way to spend NYE and this was it! The NYE party is extra but just what we were looking for. The buffet included steak, turkey, asparagus a kids buffet (burgers etc) and a wonderful dessert selection (assorted mini cheesecakes, cupcakes and cookies). The DJ and MC were awesome and provided all sorts of entertainment... games, dances etc. The zoo lights were beautiful! We loved that it ended early so we could get back to the hotel to be up for the parade.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ITravl4Fun
30,"Underwhelming. Needs a bit of TLC, but stilla good variety of animals","This zoo is ok and an enjoyable enough day out.... but it could be so much better. Some of the enclosures were empty, other areas were smelly and dirty (notwithstanding that is to be expected around animals). It felt unloved and tired. I can think of several zoos that are far better, the Living Desert in Palm Springs for example. I’d expect more from a zoo in a large global destination such as LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/egnorth8
40,Lots of Animals!,"Enjoyable day at the zoo. Take your time strolling though the exhibits. Consider getting a shuttle pass ($5/adult, $2/seniors) which has multiple stops around the perimeter, limiting the need to walk.Restaurants have vegetarian options, and typically a small selection of beer and wine.An enjoyable time away from the hustle of LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RealDoubleM
10,LA Zoo Holiday Lights,"Terrible experience! Commercials on TV say it's the best Holiday Lights show, and there were very lights dedicated to Christmas! There were lots of lights hanging from trees and such, but very few related to the Holidays; not even Holiday music was playing. I felt I was in a low key Rave Party with disco music playing. There was a Santa's hut, but not much else gave me the feeling of Christmas. There were more lights around from all the vendors selling lighted toys. Way too many vendors selling trinkets and hot chocolate and churros. Definitely will not be recommending LA Zoo lights to friends. The cost $21 per person was not worth the money. I recently visited Chicago's Lincoln Park Holiday ZooLights, and it was amazing! Christmas music, holiday decorations, music-synced light show playing holiday songs. The only stands selling products was the gift shop and stands selling hot chocolate, mulled wine, and hot apple cider. Now that's festive!! And it was FREE!!! Save your money and save the drive and the traffic hassle and don't go to LA Zoo Lights. It's nothing but a glorified light up vendor show!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/naomio759
40,"Fun and easy, a great evening","We love going to the LA Zoo Lights show at the Zoo. Took the whole family and everybody had a great time. Going to the Zoo at night is a totally different experience that during the day. Many animal exhibits were understandably closed to the public but the exhibits that were open were beautifully lighted, there is a laxer light show in one area and a tunnel of lights. We spend about an hour and 45 minutes, and the evening had a magical quality to it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/talkslikeaduck
10,LA ZOO LIGHTS ARE POINTLESS,"It's Christmas time, though several other observances have horned in and so everything is simply made for the ""holidays"" now. The blurb on the LA Zoo Lights is that it's ""L.A.'s Brightest Holiday Tradition"" (from zoo map/guide). I remember when you used to be able to drive through the area outside the animal area for free and look at the various light displays that depicted all kinds of scenes. That ended, and so now you have to pay $20 to the zoo (per person) to go inside and walk around in the dark looking at colored lights everywhere, but not much else. They just hang lights on everything, and sell you food and whatnot along the path. You can't see any animals because they are all sleeping, and you just walk with the crowd from the entrance, around, and back, and you ask yourself, ""what was that???"" It's just a bunch of lights like i a disco. No significance, no scenes, no Santa or Nativity, just lights on trees and shining on the ground. You would fare far better, and without charge, to drive through some nicely decorated neighborhood with your car radio set to Christmas music. This attraction is a bust for the consumer, but a financial boon to the zoo (I'm guessing). Save your money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RevLovebrew
40,Gr8 Zoo!,"I loved this zoo! It was nice! And big! It seems 2 take the whole day that the zoo is open 2 look @ all the animals. About 7 hours. But weirdly enough, it seems like I saw more animals @ the Denver Zoo when I went there in ‘15! Plus, it lists different animals online that weren’t actually there. Otherwise, worth the visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chardburner
40,Great time for the kids,"We were at the zoo for a school field trip. We had docent-led tours which were fantastic. The docent told us the names of the animals, stories about how they came to be at the zoo. I think we saw more animals and learned more about them with the docent than on a regular day when we visited the zoo ourselves. The kids really enjoyed seeing all the different animals. I am highly considering having a docent give us a tour the next time my family visits the zoo.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JTfromSoCal
50,This Review is Only for the LA ZOO LIGHTS - Nov 16 - Jan 6 - Not for Animal Viewing,"Hi All, Important to note that this is an evening out that is very different than most. It features constant Lighting demonstrations throughout the Park and a few quickie shows that are different and fun from ""Splashes of Light"" Water and Laser show, Twinkle Tunnel and much more. There is a lot of walking, yet everywhere you go are lights and more lights of beauty. We got our tickets online with a specific start time for entrance. We statey for about 2 1/2 hours which included a nice, inexpensive dinner of hamburger, chicken and fries. Great family affair.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GaryFleishman
50,Surprisingly Good,This is the first time I have been to this zoo. I have been to the SD Zoo Wild Animal park more times than I can remember and the Zoo in Washington DC as a comparison.I was not expecting much as I have found alot of Los Angeles attractions overly crowded (and overpriced) and with trash laying around. Sorry to to be so negative but I grew up in LA.and left along time ago.The zoo was very non crowded I think it was because we went on Thanksgiving.It was clean. Not a single wrapper on the grounds and the animal areas were clean.Its not a large zoo with alot of animals i.e. like the SD Zoo which is world famous but it is very much worth seeing. Parking is easy and its right off the freeway.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I4696UZstevenh
50,Really Nice Zoo,"Very nice zoo - a gem in a large city. Reasonable admission, wide variety of animals (though a bit heavy on birds), attractive grounds, wide walkways, clean restrooms, plenty of water fountains. We visited in November so temperatures were comfortable. Signage directing you to various areas could be better. Having checked other reviews before coming here you should know first that this is not San Diego ($54), National Zoo/Smithsonian in Washington DC (free but charge for parking) or the Bronx Zoo ($29), and does not pretend to be. Second, hills are far easier to navigate than SD and DC. Go, experience it, enjoy it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/78chevy
40,Great L.A. area zoo!,"Great zoo, especially for kids. Great attractions and decent food. Parking is free, with plenty of space. The nearby Gene Autry Museum, across the zoo parking lot, is worth seeing too. If you really love zoos, check out the San Diego zoo, which is considered the best zoo in Southern California, if not all Cali.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JJCrawford
40,Zoo is not a BOO.....,"I went on a Sunday when it was Boo at the Zoo! The children were fun to watch in their costumes collecting candy. They got a bag and candy as they came in. I think adults did also!The line was long at noon! There is VIP parking near the entrance for $10. The zoo isn't the best I have been to but also not the worst. It is VERY hilly. Preparing for hiking in comfy shoes and ALOT of walking!Most of the animals were sleeping by noon, but it was almost feeding time for several! The gorillas were HILARIOUS and I could have watched them all day! The Snow Leopards were also very playful! The tiger was hiding but I found him with my camera lens!I didn't like some exhibits as they have too much wire to attempt to take pictures or see the animals!The bird exhibit smelled horrible and I barely saw any birds …..The plants are beautiful and so is the layout of the zoo!I would take food if you are bringing children to save money! Kids were wanting something at every stop! It could add up quickly!Great time to go now with all the Halloween exhibits! There is one area with fun props for great photos!There are times for specific up close with animals at certain areas and the line to feed the giraffes is long! I would go do those things first!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/223pammyb
40,Boo At The Zoo Experience,"I visited during the Halloween celebration and it's a great place to go for young children. The Zoo Halloween celebration: ""Boo At The Zoo"" allows children to participate in an interactive stage play and take pictures in a pumpkin patch.Avoid going during the midday as most of the animals were either sleeping or resting because of the L.A. weather. Plan your trip ahead of time, because most of the exhibits are only available during specific hours and days.The location is a little hilly, and you should wear comfortable shoes and clothes. There's a tram that goes around the Zoo, but it's an additional fee. Also, the Zoo is outdoors and I would suggest you prepare (sunscreen, hat, bug repellent) for the weather.There is free parking, however, it seems to fill up really fast (go before 11:00 a.m.), otherwise paid parking costs $10 dollars. Additionally, if you have a Groupon or another coupon I would download/print before I arrive. When I visited the Zoo was trending and we couldn't get the coupon to load.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KoreanConven
50,Amazing zoo,"This is a zoo you must visit. I have been to various zoos around the country and none are better than this one Allow plenty of time to enjoy the many exhibits. Even on a hot day you will stay cool due to the great design of the zoo itself. Many paths shaded by trees take you on your journey from exhibit to exhibit. Most of the animals are in excellent surroundings specifically created for their needs while I am not normally a fan of caged animals, this zoo takes great care to keep the exhibits as natural as possible and very clean.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Seacreature1
50,A great backup plan.,"We originally planned to go San Diego zoo but in the day we got an hour into the drive and decided we’d turn round and go Los Angeles zoo instead. We had Go Los Angeles cards so money wise, it cost the same. If you’re doing multiple attractions in LA over your trip, getting a Go Los Angeles card is something you should look into, as it does save you money compared to buying all the tickets individually.Compact but involves lots of walking up hill so beat that in mind.We went on a hot Monday and it was really quiet, so definitely try to go in the week and not a weekend.Staff were really knowledgable on all the animals and happy to answer any questions.Definitely worth a visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danniranger
50,80's Roaring night,"Fun experience, great live music, good food truck selection, plenty of drinking areas and fun art for pictures moments.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tencha1
50,"A bit crowded on weekends, but...","This is a great place for kids, parents and grandparents. Lots of walking, some up hill. But tons to see and do. If you have younger children, be sure to visit the special children's area just inside the front gate, and the playground in the northwestern corner of the park.Food and drink are expensive. But the snow cone guy is well worth the $4 for a GIANT SHAVED ICE the whole family can share.It takes several hours to see the whole zoo, so if you have younger children, I highly recommend a membership so you can come, spend a couple of hours and not feel like you have to do the whole zoo in one day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/29cindya
40,It's A Workout,This zoo has a lot of smaller exhibits with birds and monkeys throughout the zoo in between the larger animals. They have a pretty decent collection of animals including a beautiful elephant exhibit that is acres large with multiple yards for them to play. They have really good keeper talks & training demonstrations. We saw the sea lion & the elephant ones & we got to see the elephants get a bath! They also have one of the most beautiful otter exhibits we have ever seen. Some of the exhibits are older but I'm sure updates and renovations are in the works. The location is one of the hilliest I've done and we were exhausted by the end so drink lots of water! Other than that we loved it & would definitely go back! We recommend if you're in the area!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kalrings
30,Disappointed,There on a Sat aft. For a large metro area this is the worst zoo we've ever visited. Was dirty and most of the employees we witnesses were either interacting with other employees or on their phones. Many of the animal displays made it difficult to have any chance to see the animal and considering most zoos are going to clear walls this zoo is woefully behind.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/creekvue1
50,Fantastic,"I am a great animal lover. Always go the zoo on my travels. The zoo is fantastic, loved seeing the koalo bears, don't get many of these in the UK. All the animals looked healthy & happy. Enclosures seemed big enough & clean. We just times it right to watch the otter pups sliding into the pool. Ate @ 1 of the cafeterias. Great day out",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hitch1971
40,Good zoo and helpful tips,Ok so the zoo itself is good. Some enclosures have been closed for awhile now but still a good zoo overall .Here are some good tips that we have been experiencing for a while now1- bring your own food and drinks. They have ice to fill up water bottles in most of the restaurants.2- zoo says closes at 5 but they bring most of the animals in by 4:30.3- membership is a great value and will save you money4-members get 10% off food and gift shops5- parking is free6- you must do the giraffe feeding .try not to be last few that feed them because sometimes the giraffes get tired of feeding and can walk away7-do the hippo encounter and book in advance8-we find best time to see chimpanzees is around 3-4.most active9- bear is a rare site but plays in water a lot if out10-if kids are allergic to bees just be careful and bring your epipen. Many bees in summer but don’t really bother you11-be prepared for a lot of walking .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lb33wonka
40,Worth a visit if you’re in the area,"We visited LA zoo for the morning as it was an included attraction on our LA GoPass and we were nearby for the WB Studio Tour. The zoo was well laid out and very green with lots of shade. Whilst it was good to be able to see most of the animals and have them quite close to the fences, I felt the enclosures were quite small. This is in comparison to Melbourne Zoo and Werribee Zoo in our home town. It made us feel a bit sad for the animals they they didn’t have much space. I guess you lose out on space in exchange for getting a good view of the animals. The flamingos were a highlight for us!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amybQ7842IB
40,A better place than you might think,"People tend to downgrade the LA Zoo because the ""San Diego Zoo is better"". There are a lot of things the Los Angeles Zoo does do really well. For example they have a great Chimpanzee area (and the San Diego Zoo doesn't even have chimps. They have bonobos which are different). And they have many different areas where you can see animals up close. People are always hanging around the meerkats and the flamingos.The giraffes bring you more up to their level instead of having to look up. They have a wide variety of all sorts of animals. And they do a lot of special events all year long. I attached a photo from the Zoo Lights they do in November and December. Not many animals on exhibit (it is dark outside) but they bring in reindeer you can see both night and day. They do concerts during the summer and every holiday has a special event.It is an older zoo that has been upgrading many things. The LAIR area (Living Amphibians Invertebrates and Reptiles) not only has snakes and lizards from around the world but also features an area about California Wildlife. The Orangutans have plenty of ropes to climb on and people can see them from various angles. Lots of other things so go to the website to see what is currently going on.If you like animals and are coming for a visit the Los Angeles Zoo is a great place to check out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jim_Wito
40,A Fun & Family Oriented Place!,"The Los Angeles Zoo & Botanical Gardens is a massive complex in Griffith Park. Parking is usually free with somewhat easy access from the freeway. This is the main zoo for the region and is a top destination for school groups and families.My family and I were here last Sunday in the morning and we were lucky to find a good spot to park our car even though the lots were full. Thank goodness we had bought tickets online (ahead of time) because the line to buy was insane. Due to summer, it was hot and I recommend bringing a hat or umbrella and plenty of water. The sprawling layout requires a lot of walking and climbing grades heading from exhibit to exhibit.Overall, the zoo does a nice job of creating unique and interesting exhibits, but it is not a true destination zoo like the one in San Diego. A number of the animals in enclosures were hard to see or missing and a couple of signs displayed that they had been removed.Nevertheless, it is a good place to take the kids, and has a zoo lights program during the darker holiday season.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NyonyaLady
20,"Vast distances to walk, and a few sad-looking enclosures","Our visit to the zoo was disappointing. One has to walk a lot to see anything and there are few signs indicating where to go. And there were moments of unpleasant surprise, especially upon visiting the snow leopard enclosure. The animals were hardly moving under the hot sun, panting away as they lay on the rocks, and had nowhere cool to retreat to. This is not an acceptable way to keep these precious and endangered animals.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lucialoup777
50,Great for everyone,"So many animals to see and a great way to spend your weekend, very reasonably priced, on the day tickets cost $21 pp not bad at all, definitely recommend a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/imaddg
40,First time to this zoo,"My first time visiting the L.A. Zoo and it was a nice to see the animals, but in the summer time the larger animals tend to hide from the hot sun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/808sanjeetl
40,A nice zoo,"I took my young daughter and was excited to see the animals with her. It was a hot August day and I was a little worried we wouldn’t see anything. I was pleasantly surprised at how many animals we did get to see, although some were hiding from the heat. There’s a lot to see and numerous scheduled animal talks depending on the day. It is a very large zoo so be prepared to walk a lot, including hills. Admission was a bit pricey and I can see this being an expensive day for a family with multiple kids. I don’t think it’s worth it to pay for the tram but I was happy to see parking was free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DJBrandon
50,Must see for annimal lovers,"Take your time to visit the LA zoo, the park is quite extensive and you can spent half a day easily to see all animals. Parking can be a bit of a hassle but worth the effort",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/raymondd373
30,Just an average Zoo,Zoo was kind of boring. Not too much going on and a lot of the animals were not even out. Lots of people that day and weather didn't help much.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lizmirjac
50,So much to do,"So much to do here! The place is really massive. We spent 3 hrs here and didn’t even get to finish the whole zoo. Lots of exhibits, nice petting zoo, clean facilities and helpful staff. Saw lots of families bring in ice chests/coolers full of snacks/food to have picnics inside the zoo. Entry line was long, we bought our tickets online and skipped the long line, and just showed the tickets on my phone to the attendant.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/madrehoodandoils
50,A great place to visit and a wonderful resource for preservation of endangered species (if you're into that),"My cousins brought their 13 year old granddaughter for a short visit to SoCal. Other than mall shopping, this very sweet little animal lover didn't have too many 'must visit' items on her list so we opted for a day at the zoo. This is the second time in 72 years i've visited there and about the sixth time for any zoo visit, anywhere. This place is great. Staff are friendly and helpful. The animals we saw are healthy and are maintained in clean, appropriate-for-origin/breed enclosures. The Zoo breeds some of the most endangered species in the world, as well as maintaining some of the only living creatures in a couple of instances (i'm old and i can't remember which). LAZoo is part of DNA studies internationally which try to enhance the gene pool to avoid inbreeding. We loved the giraffes: 2 'babies', one only a couple of months old. The koalas are always a hit and one woke up while we were there and accepted some eucalyptus from a keeper! I've never seen one awake! Hippos, okapi, mountain tapir, OH MY! too absolutely wonderful. Very good quick lunch, then off to Venice Boardwalk to look at the free-ranging species native to that area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JuneL337
40,Really nice zoo,"After 40 years, finally went to the LA zoo. Took a visiting nephew who likes animals and he had a blast. Zoo was really clean and not very smelly.Like a lot of people said, there is not a lot of shade, nor places to cool down.Good variety of animals. Spent more time then I thought we would, but definitely were fried afterwards. Spent an hour in front of an AC.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jayy
40,Nice zoo,This was a nice zoo in the middle LA. It’s big. It was very hot outside so much of the animals were laying around. It is a lot of walking and incline walking. I liked there was a play around at the far end of zoo (and it’s all shaded). We spent about three hours.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D1565FWangelat
40,Nice zoo need walking shoes!,"It was a nice zoo.. a lot if animals you don’t usually see at the zoo. We are zoo members in NYC so honored our membership for discount. It is a large zoo, not to much shade.. we went on a day it was 98 degrees probably not the best idea. Cute carousel. Lots of walking up hills.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Momwholvsherkids
20,Sad experience: Depressed Animals,"Me and my husband took our son here while we were visiting LA from NYC. I was excited to see the lions, tigers and other big cats. I have to say I was really sad seeing how depressed these bigger animals were in the small habitats they were provided to live in. The lions and tiger exhibits were so small. The lions had enough room to pace back and forth and that was about it. The lions were sleeping (as lions do for most of the day), but while they are awake they are used to roaming a large area. We had been to Selous in Tanzania and have seen them in the wild. The tiger was so upset it was very aggressive. It just paced back and forth roaring very loudly and you could tell he was in distress. It was pretty unsettling.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/779laurenp
40,Family day,"We wanted to share an experience as a help my daughter learn about other members of the planet. Saturday is a good day because there are a lot of shows. We went in Friday, when you come out early you are able to see the animals before they retreat inside. We joined the zoo membership which shares discounts and passes with other zoos and museums citywide and other states too. It supports the zoo and also gives discounts and a special entrance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stthomasc2016
40,"Long time in between visits, but still fun","The last time I went to the Los Angeles Zoo was on a school field trip in the 60's! I moved away long ago, but my daughter lives in Southern California now and we try to do one or two touristy things when I'm visiting. This time we settled on the zoo. We were both impressed - the animal habitats were overall amazing (the lion habitat could use a little work). The grounds were immaculate and the foliage was beautiful and truly fit the various areas represented. We had a surprise thunderstorm when we were there and it was interesting listening to the different animals react to the thunder. The peacocks took the prize for the loudest! Fun to see the baby giraffe. Just a really, really fun and relaxing day. Note: The zoo is built on the side of a hill, so while it is beautiful - there is a lot of walking and half of it is uphill!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ibcbanker
30,"Older zoo, could really use some renovations; but do the Hippo Encounter","The L.A Zoo is surprisingly behind the times when compared with other zoos. We were disappointed that so many of the animal enclosures were still of the concrete variety. I hope at some point they modernize the facilities. The only reason I give it an Average score rather than Poor was the Hippo Encounter - it redeemed the visit. I have not seen another zoo that includes hippos among their special experiences, and it was awesome to get up close, pet them, see them eat, etc. It was like petting a basketball. It's only on weekends and you better book it in advance, but it was very cool.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RoadJunkie
30,Its a zoo,This zoo has people raise millions and has a lot of wealthy donors . I am wonder where are the upgrades and where the money is spent? It’s an ok zoo with very expensive food and employees who are not very enthusiastic .Bring walking shoes for a great work or catch the tram. I do recommend looking at the weather as Burbank can be very hot May to October . Parking is free and you may bring in your own food .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/805lisag
40,Sunday Fun-day at the Zoo:),"Lots of walking! But we were prepared with water bottles and hats. $21 per adult to get in. Spent a pleasant day wandering around with my 14 yr old son, who thought it was really good. Tons of animals to see, including elephants, lions, tigers and giraffes, among many more. Drinks and treats are fairly expensive inside. But lots of eating options and places to fill the water bottle. Head to the back of the Australian exhibit to get inside for a cool down while looking at the wombats. Very nice zoo with suitable enclosure (except for the lions and the bear:(",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Anilizzy
40,Lots of walking but interesting,"The zoo itself is actually in Burbank, so it takes awhile to get there via interstate. They have additional excursions like hippo encounters, but they sell out very quickly so hard to get those. There's a ton of walking and the animals are interesting, but some of the exhibits are extremely difficult to find. We were there 4 hours and never did find the zebras or white tigers. Fun for kids though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/minimacaz
50,A good place to see while in LA,My family with teenage soon found this Zoo to be cost-effective and a good use of our time while in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kyleb2013

50,Great Day Out,"When I went to So. Cal. for a winter getaway, I headed to the San Diego Zoo. But for my money, the LA Zoo is just the ticket. First, it's way more affordable, and they don't distract you for charged additional attractions and photos. This zoo is quieter, greener and a more pleasant experience for me and my family (and maybe the animals). My only disappointment, feedings and shows are infrequent and few. A stroll here is a must everytime I visit LA in the winter.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JFF34
30,Hot day; uphill hike,"From the point of view of the visitor there were many things not to like. One ticket window open (out of 11) resulted in a long line even on a week day. The ticket window is at the base of a hill and to see the animals themselves, you are basically walking up hill (and then down, of course). There is a shuttle you can take from about 1/3 of the way up which will take you to the top and then you can walk down, seeing the animals on the way. As we were there in the afternoon of a hot day, the animals were inactive and not very visible. But, on the bright side for the animals, they had plenty of room (unlike some other zoos we have visited.Another negative; some of the restaurants were closed and some of the vending machines didn't work.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kenmL1003UG
40,Feed the giraffes!,"I quite enjoyed this zoo. It cost 21$ to get it, which is similar to other zoos that I have been too. They have a really nice Australian area where I got to see some animals that I normally haven't seen in zoos where I live (PNW; such as Koalas, Tazmanian devil, kangaroo, etc). My favorite thing about this zoo is that for $5 you can hand feed the giraffes. For those who love giraffes or up close personal experiences, you will definitely enjoy this! It's not a super huge amount of time - just walk up and feed it - but for those who love giraffes, it means quite a bit. This isn't the ""best"" zoo I have ever been to, but I feel like they have done a good job. Be prepared for lots of walking. They have good snow cones here, but they are pricy (like any zoo).Also - calling this a ""botanical garden"" is not accurate in my opinion. If you're going for the botanical portion, be prepared to be disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/279ericai
30,could be better,animal shows were very boring - no interaction with the crowd. plenty of animals available. families with young kids should take the shuttle. the cafes close very early though.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marilyne2375
40,I don't like zoos,"OK I normally don't like zoos because animals should be free huh. But this place is like a big park and the animals have lots of room and space and never look unhappy. Its a well planned out facility and is huge. Sure many of the animals are hiding at any given time but its still a nice place and if the animals look happy, I am happy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashleysK4355MG
50,Los Angeles Zoo,Wonderful zoo for everyone! So much to see & lots of walking through beautifully landscssped paths! Petting zoo is great for little ones.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lm1109
20,"Crappy layout, on hills, no signage","Ridiculously steep bottom to top layout, lack of signage for most side roads, we only found the shuttle by pure luck, unlike modern zoos many animals are in outdated and sad fenced-in cages. It's like an Easter egg hunt trying to guess which way to go looking for animals you want to see.And go when it's overcast because the hill and trees block every hint of a breeze.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oa888sis
40,Had a free entrance ticket and was staying nearby,Giving them one extra point because parking was free and because the zoo had some interesting animals I had never seen before. But for the rest it didn't feel much like a famous zoo or even a botanical garden. Though docents or volunteers were very knowledgeable. Feed the Giraffe was a fun activity for younger visitors.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/010bertv
50,"Lots to see, be prepared to walk","Huge zoo and so much walking. Lots to see. Kids loved it. If you decide to come here with small children, be prepared with cold water because it gets tiring & hot. Zoo is pretty cool.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarayang27
30,Expected Better,"The only real plus points for this zoo is that - on paper - it has a wide range of animals, and the price of $21 for entry is quite reasonable. However, prices on the inside are unacceptably bad. We went on a very hot day and some of the animals we were most interested in seeing were either asleep or totally inanimate due to the temperature. There's also a lot of walking to be done, and not much shelter from the sun. The map is also a tad confusing. I think it probably makes for a better experience in cooler weather.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danverec
30,Busy zoo,"We went on a Saturday in April. The zoo was packed and we had to wait in line for tickets. I have foot problems but the zoo was hilly and my husband couldn't push a wheelchair up those hills. We didn't get an electric vehicle because I would have never been able to get through the crowds. We walked, looked, and sat. I like going to the zoo better when it is not crowded. I think for such a warm place rather then have all these animals in cages, it would be better to have an open zoo with the animals being able to roam.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lynnette27
50,A Favorite Weekend Activity,"We visit the LA Zoo whenever we get a chance. It is a fun place to visit with many different activities besides viewing animals. There is always at least one volunteer on the sidewalks with an animal that you can learn about and touch, such as snakes, hedgehogs, and lizards. The petting zoo also has a variety of animals, such as sheep and goats, that you can pet and brush. The LA Zoo is very big, so you'll never get bored or run out of things to do. For example, we always love feeding the giraffes. The bird show is exciting because several types of birds fly just above your head from a mountain top up above. We enjoy watching the river otters as they go down their slide. The food at the LA Zoo is pretty good because there are many different restaurants that you can chose from. There is also a fun indoor children's play center next to the entrance called the California Condor Rescue Zone. You'll have to look for it because it's hidden.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChloeCarnitas
20,Nothing special,This is a small zoo with a very confusing layout. Enclosures reminded me of the horrible cages that I remember from the 60's and 70's. We were really disappointed in this place and would never go again. I am surprised it is still open. It really needs to keep up with the times and remodel everything.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Arizona1964
10,Horrible zoo,"This zoo is not something you should spend your money on.The animals look so depressed and sad. This is probably because they have some of the smallest cages i have seen in a modern zoo.Half of the cages barely have a rock or a tree. It's really sad to look at.If you are an animal-lover i wouldn't recommend this zoo.Also the ""mexican"" food we got there had zero taste to it.Just sad.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/julielE397XH
20,"Diss appointing. Small habitats, poor shade, animals need more care. Where is peta?",". Where is freaking PETA now. They sue and harass people for stupidities and I do not see them suing LA to take keep these animals with dignity. All politics.This zoo is small and depressing. It seems that you are in a third world county zoo1) habitats are too small and in need of maintenance. Even for small animals the habitats. We’re small2) some animals need more shade it was a SUNY warm day. The zebras were desperate looking for shade trying to stay against the wall. They did not have enough shade.3) some animals need more care. They look that they re not taken care of. The leopard was limping.4) if you see the lion habitat, it is so small and so depressing little dirt for the animal and mostly concrete.What they have are huge stores with lots of souvenirs Food is expensive and not worth it. Sodas and water outrageous $4 for a soda bottle and 3 for a water bottle.If you are in SoCal visiting. I would say go to San Diego Zoo. This zoo is much bigger., they have big decent habitats for the animals and do take care of the animals. More expensive, but worth it",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ericuchon
40,Gorillas In The Midst,"I have a thing about gorillas - I want to visit them whenever possible. I arrived at the zoo when the gates opened. The lines were a little long, but by purchasing my ticket online on my phone, I was able to skip the lines - but I also forfeited the $2 discount I found in the hotel brochure. It was worth skipping the lines for. They do not have lockers, so I rented a stroller for $10 to carry my camera equipment. The zoo is extremely hilly, but what a great workout! I arrived at the gorillas just as they were fed, and employees were available to answer questions. I cried and watched them for 1.5 hours. Beautiful. I walked the rest of the zoo and observed everything. The walkways need to be cleaned - like water blasted cleaned of gunk. Many of the exhibits are in need of repair. But overall, it's lovely and has lots of shaded areas for resting. I did encounter a gentleman to decided to steal a stuffed animal in front of me and his 8-9-10 year old daughter. I confronted him and asked him why. An employee was there immediately to help, and police arrived. Very sad. To risk going to jail for a $10.99 stuffed animal. For the most part guests were courteous to others. Upon leaving the zoo at 1:30, the lines and groups outside were humongous! I would suggest arriving at the zoo when the gates open, the animals are fresh, and the crows are still at home sleeping.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Becks013
40,Boo at the Zoo,"We bought a yearly family membership because I found a coupon online for a discount. We had to register to come for early access to the boo at the zoo and unfortunately the membership cards had not arrived. It took almost 4 weeks to get the membership cards. However, we were on the list and I just showed them my id and receipt to get in. We arrived at 9am with kids between the ages of 3 and 9 and all of them enjoyed the zoo. They gave out free 99cent bags to put the candy in you get from multiple stations around the zoo. The lines were long and there weren't as many stations as there should have been with that size crowd. The food there was also expensive even though you get a small discount with the membership. However, the kids had a ball trick or treating while dressed in costumes. They mostly liked watching the meerkats hide in the pumpkins, seeing the baby monkeys, going through the corn maze (gets very crowded so go early), watching the swinging monkeys, watching the bird show, watching the elephants get checked and bathed, watching the family gorilla feeding time and most of all playing at the playground. I believe the zoo can be enjoyed by all ages but mostly kids under 12. Also, there is a lot of walking so we bought along a stroller for the 3 year old and he did get tired a few times.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Exquize
50,Fun day!,Great zoo. Many animals to see. You can feed a giraffe for $5. (Very cool!) Try to arrive early. Lines can get long. Really enjoyed our day there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/3peepsocon
30,Nothing Special,"I find the zoo borderline as far as the way its maintained.Needs to be remodeled.This is The Los Angles Zoo, should be better.Not really that much for young kids to do, it's average.Worse thing I went with my grandson, and my daughter, and was there 30 minutes in front area of Zoo when I got my wallet either stolen out of my backpack, or it fell out.Missing after coming out of crowded bathroom at entrance of Zoo.My 150 dollars gone. My wallet returned, the next day, obviously my money was gone. What happened remains a mystery.But I talk to someone else who had the same experience.Also now you pay for parking on weekends, and it's very crowded, I recommend you go, weekdays early.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anajuliaf2016

You're able to see a wide variety of animals, the food is great, and parking usually isn't too big of an issue. Be sure to bring tennis shoes, water, and a hat as it does get quite warm and its an all-day activity. Would definitely recommend this place!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/megmcmuffinn
20,Too small enclosures,"They charge $21 for adult admission and $16 for kids. For that, I expect a zoo that has large enough areas to House its animals, and this zoo lacks that. A snow leopard and tigers need more roomDid get to see a Joey and baby flamingos",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SaminDC
40,Nice morning out,"The appeal here were the Koala Bears. The zoo itself is easy enough to walk around, hilly, but compact enough. We were able to see all the animals. It wasn't very busy during our visit so we could spend as much time as we wanted at each enclosure. The Koalas were not easy to spot but we eventually found them and even managed to get pictures. Food from the restaurant by the gift shop was a touch pricey but the portions were huge. I don't think the zoo is extortionately priced for entrance when compared with the price of a trip to the zoo in the UK. The kids loved it. Overall, pleasantly surprised.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P4092DEemmac
50,Nice way to Spend the Day,"I usually try to visit the zoo in the city I am in. This zoo had quite a variety of animals and exhibits. The zoo is hilly but, makes for a great walk. It takes about 4 hours to go through the zoo and I thoroughly enjoyed the Tasmanian Devils and Kangaroos. I cannot see what everyone complains about...It was a great day and afterwards we drove to the Griffith Observatory for the sunset.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RClarkTravlr
20,Nice way to spend some time but...,"We decided to visit the Zoo prior to an evening flight home and it was a good way to spend the morning/early afternoon. There are quite a few animals here that we were looking forward to seeing but it was really disappointing to get to their enclosures only to learn that they were not there (They weren't hiding, just simply not there). I particularly felt that we should have been informed of this when we were buying our tickets at the entrance gate as it is not cheap. Lions/Tigers/Bears are a main attraction and none were there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/An0nymou5

40,Expansive zoo with some limitations,"This is a great zoo with fantastic animals we've never heard of! The ""marketplace"" at the entrance right past the gates was a little crowded, but I'm sure it's because everyone is getting their souvenirs before leaving.Larger food venues for getting a meal and sitting down were sparse, and very crowded. We had a hard time getting a table, and the prices were pretty expensive for simple meals. But the food quality itself was good.We also found some of the timed shows to be pretty limited. It may have been the time of year. We found ourselves at the wrong ends of the zoo for some of the shows while trying to make other shows.The parking area was also nearly full and individuals were parking along the sides of lanes, which made it pretty crowded.All in all, a nice visit to a large zoo in Griffith Park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/commguy101

40,one of the best,"Diverse collection of animals from different continents and it's evident that great effort is made to meet their various needs. thus the animals appear to be healthy and 'happy'. There are a lot of trees so it makes walking around the whole area a little less tiresome. Restrooms are scattered around, which is great for families with little kids and signs/directions are in strategic places so you don't get lost. You also learn a lot from the information placed near every exhibit. if you have an annual membership, this is also a great place to do your walking exercises.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GwenR88
30,Nice Zoo,"The zoo is large and has a lot of interesting animals. My main complaint is that the zoo is built on a fairly steep hill. If you’re pushing a stroller or have small children walking, it is a climb. There is a train that you can get for $5 that takes you around the whole zoo. It was worth it even though we just took it to the top, got off andThere is a hippopotamus experience that you can do for an extra charge. It is worth the money. You get to see the two hippos close up and personal.Another added feature for an added cost is getting to feed one of the giraffes. They do like to charge for a lot of extras at this zoo.There are various restaurants and washrooms around the zoo.It was easy to get an Uber to and from the zoo. Plan to spend 3-4 hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tshep42
50,One of the Best Walks,"The best of plants and animals! I'm a regular to zoos and sanctuaries and love this place. The paths ramp in such a way that you forget you're going up a mountain. Saw tons of active, playful animals, the most enrichment and active I've ever seen! Also saw tons of new animals I've never heard of. Love the midday feeding times, especially with the hippos (they answer to their names and seem to really like the keeper!) and the andean condor who LOVES playing with his empty milk jug.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/caanneu
40,A Wonderful Place of Animals,"While in Los Angeles we took our grandson to the LA Zoo. We saw lots of animals, birds, and reptiles. We were fortunate to overhear some of the docents briefing school children on the animals and birds. We found this place quite interesting and learned some new facts. Great place for kids parents and grandparents.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CurtK815
30,Zoo person,I am spoiled and go to San Diego zoo few times a year but every city I go to like zoo walks. When weather nice great way exercise and enjoy the zoo . LA zoo is hilly so you definitely get heart rate up not enough animals but worth a day out if not hot out.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alwaystravel999
20,Poor layout and map make it frustrating to find anything,"I suppose if you’ve never been to a zoo and just want to see any animal the layout would be fine. But the map is horrible, the signs inadequate and there is no one in the park to help. There appears to be no customer service and no awareness of what might make the experience enjoyable. The maps have little pictures of the animals vaguely placed, but the average person can’t use it to find anything. What it doesn’t have is the name of the animal and where to find it. They also don’t have a mobile app or anything on the web site to help. Eventually we had to stand in line at one of the concession stands to ask where the Koalas were. We were also looking for penguins, I don’t know if they have them, but we never found them. The map is great if you want to find a place to eat or find a restroom, but totally frustrating if your trying to find a specific animal.Other issues were the cages we very dated and some with tight fencing so you couldn’t see through very well. They didn’t keep the glass on some exhibits clean. In some cases, the animals were in a different cage than the sign. Lots of empty exhibits. Long distances between exhibits.All that notwithstanding, the Gorilla Exhibit is really great, the lion and tiger were pretty exiting to see.It does check the Los Angeles has a zoo box, but the zoos I’ve been to in San Diego, New Orleans, Dallas are all much better.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/_MTJ_99
30,Great value day out,"For what you get (including parking!), this is a really good day out, but average as far as zoos go. They have some really interesting animals like okapi, maned wolf and gorilllas, the premises are clean and the animals appear well taken care of. However, I have several small nitpicks about it. Firstly, the website lists armadillos but I never saw one and asked at least 4 different staff who had no idea so I was very disappointed about that. Second, be prepared for quite a walk as the zoo exhibits are really spaced out and it's very easy to miss exhibits unless you have the map to hand. Third, they allow vendors on the property, be prepared to see timeshare salesmen inside the park! Lastly the views of a lot of the animals were obstructed by excessive fencing and dirty glass.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulbN8315FP
50,A wonderful zoo close to LA,"The LA zoo is easily accessible from the 134. There are ample free parking space. Entrance is around 16$. Recently, they made improvements to the zoo by adding a lot of panels explaining the plants and trees on the premises. They also created for kids a word hunt game in cooperation with Honda. The zoo is not as nearly big as the San Diego one so you can walk everywhere. However, you have to go up a hill to reach the far north of the zoo. There is a train that you could take at the entrance for 5$/person that takes to all the different parts of the zoo. I always like to start with the flamingos and then visit Australia habitat before going up towards Africa. From there you can reach the elephant habitat which they have expanded considerably and then go visit the tiger habitats.In each habitat area, there is a restaurant. Food is not great and is pricey but that’s the case in every zoo and park you visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hanancha
50,Wonderful,"The place is compact and well planned and the attractions are easy to spot. Place is great for kids, lots to learn and lots to see. Perfect for a day trip",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/776rajatd
50,Perfect day!,"This zoo is a wonderful day trip for kids. It is well laid out and exhibits very nice. My daughter loved feeding the giraffe, the monkeys and elephants.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WorldTraveler1976
40,"A well cared for zoo. Fun, but be ready to walk","The zoo in Griffith park is fun, but it's all up hill from the parking lot (most of which is free to park in). It's not as fancy as San Diego, but if you stroll all the way to the top, you can feed a giraffe some leaves for $5. It is a long walk though. We stood in lines with many zoo regulars, who come more than once a week. The docents were friendly, as they are the only way to get most info, as the zoo doesn't post the animals names, and only has a few sign facts. A very low key zoo. It wasn't too busy even on a Saturday during the winter break.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/266richh
40,A lovely walk with lots to see. Most habitats are dated with a few exceptions,"The LA Zoo has changed in a lot in the last decade, however, the space is so large that it still has a lot of updating to do. I would say that less than 5% of the space has been renovated, because it is just that vast.If you have kiddos be sure to hurry past the well-placed, well-merchandised shops that are near the entrance by encouraging them that there is a petting zoo just beyond and to the right. There they can brush and pet goats and sheep (in theory...I've never seen a sheep out in the open, they all choose to stay in the roped off ""safe zone"".) One of the highlights is getting to wash your hands in the beautiful, sculpture-like, tiled and metal handwashing fountain (you'll see it right outside the petting zoo.)Then check out the always amusing meerkats and hurry past the odoriferous flamingos.The carousel is really a highlight, playing great music from the 80's and 90's, and with a myriad of creatures represented for riding.Be sure not to miss out on the river ottos. Their habitat is very small, but they are always rambunctious.The best part about the zoo is the zoo itself. With lots of elevation changes, and leafy canopies, you are always going to get a nice walk in. If someone in your group has challenges with mobility, they might want a wheelchair, because the first 30% of the zoo is a gentle, but consistent, uphill walk. Plan to spend at least 3 hours. It's a very large place. We usually end at the playground so that I can sit and relax a bit...Food in the zoo is decent, with the restaurant at the front (Reggie's Place I believe) having the best options. You are welcome to bring your own food as well.For extra credit, check out the ""old zoo"" hike nearby. You can see what even older animal habitats looked like and play ""I wonder what lived here"" when you see them.Wishing you love and romance,Aviva Vaughnauthor of slow burn women's fiction inspired by food, travel, and Jane Austen.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AvivaVaughnAuthor
40,Pretty good Zoo,We always try to a zoo when we’re on vacation and as far as zoos go it’s pretty good I think it up there with the St. Louis zoo and the Omaha zoo. Lots of places to get something to eat and drink and overpriced just like zoos are so pack a lunch and bring your comfy shoes and spend the day,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulgX7387TQ
50,Best zoo visit,"We had a wonderful time at the LA Zoo. The grounds are very nice and clean. The animals seemed to be well cared for. Quite possibly the longest time we ever spent at the zoo, 6 hours in total as there is lots to see and is large in size. Highly recommended!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A2755YNmarinad
40,what a great day!,"Brought our 16 and 13 year old to the zoo on our visit to Southern California.What an enjoyable day we had strolling the zoo and enjoying wildlife.Any animal enthusiast would like the selection of animals present...in particular the Chimps, Gorillas, Giraffes and Hippos. The bears and lions were napping.It was an easy walk around and there were plenty of drink / food stands as well as restrooms.The park was super clean and parking was easy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChrisJohnson97
50,ZOO LIGHTS,"We came for the Zoo Lights that run in December through the first week of January only but it was such a fun and amazing night for us. The light displays were beautiful and there is a carousel that all ages can enjoy. The water display with lights and music was the best! We live 3 hours away and didn't come to LA for this but if we are ever in the area again during this event we will definitely be back. This is a fun for all ages event. I hear the earlier in the month of December is the best time to come due to long lines but again, you will not be disappointed. I will recommend this event for all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marsbar112
30,A shady oasis in a busy city.,"We visited the zoo 30 years ago and were blown away. This time it did not meet all of our expectations. The zoo was clean and the staff was friendly and helpful but there are fewer animals than before. Not all of the signage was very helpful. For instance, the big striped cat was a tiger but there was no indication on the habitat about what kind of tiger it was. Similarly we wanted to know what kind of Zebras we were observing but could not find a sign indicating what type they were. We had an incredible time with the snow leopard exhibit. There were three snow leopards walking around and coming close to us for photos!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cckraft
20,Not worth it,Spread out too far -hard to see the animals with little kids. Zoo was dirty. Went in the afternoon and by 4 the animals were put away it was very weird. Says open till 5 but they put the animals away at 4. Been to a lot of zoos this one was bad. The kettle corn was the only thing good -,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sallynbtf
40,It's a Zoo.,"Comfy walking shoes, sunscreen and a bottle of water are a must for all in your party. The animals are great, some of the enclosures are not so great and the staff are a mixed bag. Some are very nice and some just like to tell people what to do all the time, which kills the sense of wonder and exploration in children. They do have a little ""train ride"" through the zoo and that is fun to do as well. The giraffe are awesome and the Tigers are fun. Reptiles are also very well presented. Best time to go is when it's feeding time and remember you may be able to get discounts on your tickets so check when you purchase what cards get a discount.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelsG3005BB
50,1st birthday smile is brighter than the lights,Took my granddaughter to the Festival of Lights at the LA Zoo had a wonderful time. We bought our tickets to Groupons which will allow this to save some money and parking was free. We went in midweek and the crowds weren't that bad. The granddaughter really enjoyed it she didn't mind the chill and she really enjoyed the lights and the people had a wonderful time. However if you're going with seniors it is a little bit of Philly and dark so I suggest taking a small flashlight to help with the seniors. The atmosphere was very cozy and family friendly. Plenty of security and I mean LAPD officers. This is definitely a do-over for the family during the holidays.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/920johnnyv
40,LA Zoo Lights 2017,"This review is pertinent to the LA Zoo Lights attraction that the zoo puts on during the winter season, not the actual zoo itself as it functions during the day.We went on a Monday evening, and arrived right at 6pm (when the zoo opens for it's lights session). There was a line waiting to get in, but as soon as they opened the gates, the line moved very quickly as the attendants just scanned the tickets and ushered people in.We went with a 3 year old, and she loved it. The lights attraction *maybe* took up about half of the zoo, and it was walking only (the safari tram does not operate at night). We thought the lights were pretty, and it was definitely catered towards kids. Adults may not be so impressed with the display, but I honestly thought it was money well spent for our daughter.The carousel was open, and you did have to pay for it (same price as during the daytime).The only animals that were visible were reindeer, and the LAIR (living amphibians/invertebrates/reptiles). The rest of the animals were likely tucked away in their nighttime enclosures behind-the-scenes.My only complaint is how expensive the food and drinks are. We were excited to get some hot chocolate and churros, but ended up just doing one cup of hot chocolate since it was over $5 with tax. I believe the were charging $4.49 for ONE churro. The mark-up was ridiculous. I think it's the same amount they charge during the daytime, but it seemed crazy for a small snack.Parking was free and easy to find, at least at 6pm. It was busier when we left around 7ish. It took us about an hour to walk around, though we didn't really linger anywhere. You could probably spend 90 mins-2 hours to do the whole thing if you took your time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JenniferD637
50,BOTH animals and beautiful Gardens,"We took our grandson and literally walked the entire zoo (over 4 miles). The zoo keepers were friendly and helpful to us, and we enjoyed the gardens too. We ate lunch sitting outdoors between the lions and the elephants! I highly recommend this zoo.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Eileenandbrad
10,Dirty and sad,"Very dirty. 'Soiled diapers on the floor of the public toilets' type of dirty and the cleaning staff just walking around the mess.The animals are sad. They elephant enclosure had all grimy water in the moat, and the whole place needs a top-to-bottom clean. AND a makeover - it is looking really beat up in some places.What a disappointing day!When the best part of the day is the free parking then you get the idea.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nickwarrilow
30,Could be much better,"We have a family membership to the LA zoo...so we go there every two months or so. It's not a great zoo, it's okay, it's way too spread out, you walk a great deal between the exhibits, and almost nothing is at eye level for the kids. They do have a pretty good children's/petting zoo area though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/souseyeh
30,Not perfect but fun with kids,The zoo lacks a bit of attention when it comes to the surroundings. There is a lot of construction mess and kack of attention to detail. The train and playground are fun for kids tho and the animals look well taken care of.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/katerinas257
50,Good example of a modern zoo.,Range of animals excellent. Could be a fair walk around but shuttle train available. Buggy hire available.The Otters well worth a look in and the flamingo fascinating. A real range of well kept species.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tonyisleham

10,Animal abuse,"I understand that some zoos do their part to keep certain animals from going extinct and I also understand that most animals are treated well by the staff. HOWEVER, as I walked around the zoo i ran into the lion's exhibit and was SHOCKED to see how these wild animals live. The amount of space they have to roam around doesn't even make up the square footage of my 1 bedroom apartment. LA Zoo, you should really look into building a bigger enclosure for the lions! I'm shook. The rocks were PAINTED ON. They didn’t not have rocks to pounce on, they barely had any shady areas because there were no trees... the worst exhibit I️ have ever seen in my life. My heart hurts for those lions...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emilym643
30,Pretty sad zoo on a weekday,"It is my first time to go to LA Zoo and I am a bit disappointed with the place. It was really sad on a weekday, we chose not to go on a weekend because we were thinking of a big crowd. Most of the eating places and souvenir shops are closed and some animals are not available for viewing. The lion's den looked so sad, the moat looks stagnant a haven for mosquitos.. poor lions. The trees and landscape needs major make over, they need gardeners there to make it more pleasant for the visitors to see. We enjoyed the interaction from the chimpanzees though, the elephants and girrafes are beautiful. The animals looks healthy but the place just looks sad.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ilovemyshihtzus5
50,We Fed Giraffes!!!,"Loads of animals to see here, thought it was really good value for money. We got there a bit after opening time and although it started fair busy it did get quieter throughout the day and come 3pm there was hardly anyone there. Most of the people were school trips I think. You can feed a giraffe while you are there for an extra fee which I'm sure was less than $5, its good fun and worth it to say you've done it. Good way to spend a good half a day. We took our own food which is allowed so don't know what food is like there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seanoldinho
50,Nothing but awesome!,So my mom and I visit the LA Zoo this past August as it was our first time to los angeles. Very friendly at the ticket counter. And very helpful staff on the inside of the park. Animals were treated well and fed regularly. First time seeing alot of those animals in reality. Will definitely plan another trip around that area again. Totally worth it. My mom and I got a caricature portrait done. So funny!!!Till next time!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnathank299
40,"Good, nothing special.","My son and I needed to kill half a day while the wife was at a baby shower, so sure lets hit up the zoo. Decent zoo, be prepared to walk! Very spread out, a little confusing to see everything. Kids always like zoos so definitely worth a trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/COloveBirds
30,Ho hum,"Visiting zoos are a bittersweet experience for me. I understand that zoos play an important role in education as well as for animal species preservation. From my brief visit I saw a wrll patronized facility with investment on the 'human' experience. However the zoo appears to be lagging behind in the development of bigger more enriching spaces for (particularly) their larger animals.Interestingly, we chose to walk to the zoo from our accommodation in Hollywood. Signage etc is not very good and it would appear walking is not a popular option.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SusieCarlucci2015
30,Loved the meerkats and flamingos!,"This was definitely not my favorite zoo of any that I have seen (and I have a crazy daughter whose 40th birthday we were celebrating who has seen zoos in every large city she has visited in the US). The animals were quite hidden. It was also so hot and dry that it was difficult to get excited about seeing anything. However, when we passed by the meerkats we were treated to a fantastic display. They were out and posing for us (well, maybe not just for us but it seemed that way). The flamingos were also a delight. Because it was so hot, we paid for the tram tour. It wasn't much but did give us an idea of the layout and a chance to get off our feet. The best part of the trip was that everyone from smallest child (age 2) to oldest adult (age 73) could find something special.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michelg949
40,Solid mid-sized zoo,"Animal enclosures look somewhat dated and small, so I felt a little sorry for them. However, the zoo itself is well maintained, and a good size to spend 2 hours (just to see highlights) to all day. I do not think spending $5 for the shuttle is worth it, unless you have little kid(s) or your are elderly. Please do not pay to park, as free parking is only 200 or so yards from the main entrance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KSC75
50,Overall a great experience and fun place to visit!,"We visited the LA Zoo with our 2 young kids (age 6 and 3) as part of our week-long spring break vacation. It was a scenic drive around the Hollywood Hills. We took a detour to drive past the Disney Studios, Universal, etc. The Zoo was a lot of fun. We really enjoyed the elephant exhibit and demonstration. It is also located just down the road from Travel Town which was also worth a visit. We really enjoyed the zoo and would visit again if we were in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GoGreenGoWhite1
50,Fantastic day out!,"A friend had recommended we visit LA zoo while we were over on holiday. Having previously visited San Diego zoo I was a bit sceptical but the promise of giraffe feeding convinced us to give it a try and I’m so glad we did! We visited with our two young kids (4 and 2) and ended up staying the entire day and still didn’t see everything! The enclosures were well set out and the whole environment was well maintained and pretty. Yes it is vast and hilly in some parts but most zoos are! Our four year old walked around it the entire day and didn’t complain once so it wasn’t that bad!The highlights were feeding the giraffes, seeing elephants really close up and the bird show. The play park was great for the kids and the spent ages running around and we had a picnic there too. My only small complaint was that the map was slightly difficult to follow at times but we worked out where we were going eventually.I would definitely recommend visiting LA zoo and if you are in any doubt like I was just go! Especially for the price,compared to other zoos mentioned previously in my review this was a total bargain!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bevdoll5
40,Place to spend a day,The Los Angeles Zoo and Botanical Gardens is a great place to spend a full day learning about the flora and fauna of our world and doing it in a beautiful setting. Should not be missed while in L.A.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/buffalojim67
20,Animals seemed sad,"I was really hoping this would be a nice zoo with nice facilities for the animals, it didn’t seem that way.The animals appeared bored and many of them lonely. The areas seemed small with little for the animals to do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I_get_around2014
30,Good Legs and Walking Shoes are a Must,"This zoo is not in the first rank and the site is part of the problem. It is in the foothills of the mountains that ring LA. As a result, there is a very confusing placement of exhibits as a result of the topography and a lot of up and down walking is required. Further, the depth of exhibits does not compare with other zoos I have been to; for example I would rate the zoo in Palm Springs as superior. Supposedly there are elephants, but no elephants were to be found and a number of other exhibits were without the animal.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tajikiev
50,Radical Night!,OK so I got to experience the LA Zoo for my first time in a different way...I attended 80s and 90s night and had SO much fun! A lot of the animals were still awake and the zoo was big enough to keep us busy! Such a fun night!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/357anikaf
50,Great place to spend the day,"My husband and I were in LA for business and I had a day off and went to the Zoo. This is a fabulous location for adults and kids.

Really fun to watch and their mom plays with them as well. The Zoo is clean, lovely to walk with all the foliage and always has something fun to see. Best value is their membership...you can then keep coming for free all year.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/valerieh256
40,Zoo Visit,"We went mid week taking advantage of the online deal to pre book at a lower price than buying at the gate. $16 per person is definitely a good deal for a zoo these days.Arriving for 10am it was nice and quiet and remained this way all day so never any crowds at any of the animal enclosures which was great.We headed up to the Elephant viewing area for the 11am demo with the keepers showing how they care for the elephants and also showing off some of the skills the elephants have been taught. This was all narrated so a good education.After this we spent the day checking out all the other animals leaving around 2:30pm so having walked about 8km around the zoo.Just as we were leaving we happened to come across the seal feeding/training so got a private show from the keepers which was awesome.Overall the zoo was good I'm not sure how I feel about animals in captivity though. I really respect the education and work to protect endangered species but some of the animals I can't help think would be much happier out on their natural habitat.The zoo was very clean, well kept and all of the staff friendly creating a really good atmosphere for adults, children and families.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FioHu
40,Pleasantly surprised,"I was skeptical of Los Angeles Zoo with it being in the heart of LA. I thought the enclosures may be small and the animals be in poor condition. However, I was pleasantly surprised! The zoo is huge! The enclosures are not cramped and most of the animals seem to be in good condition. I did see a one horned rhino however, which appeared to have a few sores scattered across its body. We saw so many animals and I like that the enclosures are sectioned according to where the animals occur naturally in the wild. We had lunch at one of the zoo's restaurants. The food was very tasty and good value for money. You can feed the giraffes for a small fee which is a nice interactive experience and a great photo opportunity. Although this zoo is not the best I have been to, I did enjoy it and appreciate the work the zoo is doing in terms of conservation for endangered species.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/katesO5818IA
40,Who doesn't like a zoo??!!,"We really enjoyed the winding but shaded walkways throughout the zoo. The first place our family goes is to the petting zoo with the goats because we have a very young one that loves to go there. Then we were off to see the elephants, giraffes, lions and gorillas. It's a large zoo but you can spend as little or as much time there as you want. Our family has a season pass so we can do just that!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Trave2leverywhere
50,We LOVE the LA Zoo!!!,"A membership to the LA Zoo is a MUST for any toddler parent! I've been coming to the zoo myself for years even before I had kids, because I enjoy animals and zoos. I remember my first time thinking the LA Zoo was going to be some dinky zoo... but it's massive and totally legit! It's not the San Diego Zoo... but who is? This is a totally legit zoo to rival any other big city zoo, and that was surprising.They are constantly renovating to make larger habitats for the animals. Even in my 10+ years living in Los Angeles, I've seen a lot of improvements that have seen a large positive change in many of the animals lives. The Gorilla and Elephant habitats in particular are very nice. There are tons of interesting kinds of animals throughout to look at!There is a a playground that is great for toddlers, and even that just got an overhaul. On Friday's they have another indoor play place called the California Condor play center (or something like that). My son LOVES the petting zoo. This is a very nice petting zoo where you DON'T feed the animals, so they have a very nice temperament. It's not like roadside, fair or farm petting zoos where people feed them, so they're always looking for handouts and can be aggressive. These animals are very nice and well cared for. They also have volunteers around the zoo some mornings with animals they tell you about and you can sometimes touch. We also enjoy the seasonal holiday displays the zoos does... specifically their Halloween displays!We have a great time here! Highly recommend it. But stay home on particularly hot days. We find we're there a few times a month at least, but rarely in the summer...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bostonsavatage

50,Los Angeles Zoo,The los Angeles Zoo was Awesome. There was 5 of us and we all loved it. There was lots of places to rest and places to have a lunch. It is so well organized and you could take a Open Bus ride around the Zoo for a small fee. You would expect a lot of Loud noises there but it was rather Quiet. Fantastic for all ages.Would recommend to see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/xxelainexx2013
10,So sad,This place needs to close its doors and either send the animals back to their natural habitat or at the very least to a zoo that can really take care of them. The animals looked depressed. All in very sad dreary dirty enclosures....most by themselves. There was on otter by himself swimming in what I would consider the size of a kiddie pool with a moat around the enclosure that was dry and dirty. The 2 lions were in an enclosure that was smaller than my backyard.....and the elephants were in some type of a Jurassic Park looking enclosure. Every elephant we saw was by itself. Don't elephants travel in herds and are very family oriented? 2 hippos laid in a pathetic concrete pool of water. I could go on and on about every animal I saw looking depressed or in enclosures too small for them and NOWHERE NEAR resembling their natural habitat. Idk....all in all this was a very sad depressing zoo and I won't ever go back again. They should close their doors and send the animals to a place that will take better care of them.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/manhdfi
20,Too little too late,What we arrived at the zoo around four thirtyish and didn't realize that they start putting the larger animals back in their pens at about five so we would have had no time to actually check out the major attractions. I was kind of bummed about it because we drove an extra hour and a half just to spend your about two hours checking out the animals in the zoo. I guess lesson learned on our part we never really did enter the zoo for the price it wasn't worth not being able to see the larger animals for only about an hour and a half,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D6950TUrobertp
40,Great to go once (if you're in town or nearby),"Not a bad zoo by any means. Wouldn't travel out of state for it, but great if you live within 2 hours of North LA/Glendale (and don't mind fighting traffic to/from). Glad we went once, but will not need to revisit. Use your sunscreen, people, and remember to hydrate.PROSDiverse variety of animals (some you might not usually see other places), affordable ticket prices, free parking.NEUTRALLots of walking, lots of hills. Doesn't seem like it would be fun for families with strollers and babies/elderly/disabled group members; but was great for 2 young people willing to hoof it back and forth, up and down, in the heat. Several gift shops with average offerings.CONSConfusing walking path layout, late opening hour (10AM PST during summer--most of the animals are hiding because of the heat by that time already).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/00Severijn
50,Fun and good food,We love the birdshow with the beautiful birds flying over your head and the otters. But this time we discovered also a great place to eat. Reggies Cafe is right by the entrance so go have a early lunch after you pet the goats and sheep. The food is fresh and tasty and healthy. The kids and we adults were throughly satisfied and surprised by this find. The staff was very friendly (thank you Samy) and thank you chef Douglas for the excellent food.We'll be back again without lugging a boring picnic....,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/verahebi
30,Tough Parking,"We went on a Sunday, and it was s little too busy, especially the parking lot. We got tired of cruising the lot looking for an opening, so we ended up paying for a prime spot. The zoo is laid out pretty well, but it was just too crowded on this day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TeemanRacketman
40,LA Zoo,Great place to see animals and plants. Allow enough time to walk through the exhibits. We arrived at opening time and visited almost all the exhibits in 5 hours. There is a play ground for little ones. Take sun screen or wear a hat because it gets hot. We also took an umbrella for shade. You are allowed to take in food. Take water too! I liked that there is no parking fee and the zoo is located right off the freeway and easy to find.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/klok0501
10,Los Angeles Zoo,"The animals are been kept in small cages exp.the giant otters where bathing in a small box twice their size, the rhino, hippo and the rest of the animals where been kept in a small cloujure all the animals where sad.The plants in the zoo are dried and ugly, I DO NOT RECOMEND TO ENYONE to visit the Los Angeles Zoo!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emitzi
30,Go prepared!,"This was a nice zoo. However its up in a mountain so the walking has a lot of uphill/downhill. It was a very hot day so the animals weren't active. The gift shops were decent priced. It was included in our LA Go Pass, which is why we went. But I heard a woman at the counter getting tickets and 2 adults 2 kids was $70. A bit steep for a zoo admission. So if you're going in the summer, go prepared with lots of fluids and a way to stay cool. It was too hot so we didnt stay very long. I also thought that the final route on the path that leads you to the exit required a lot of walking and not much to see. Felt like a ""waste of time"" and when the kids are hot and tired, it makes for a bummer ending.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GasolineGypsy
50,Like in the jungle,I saw many new animals that I had never seen. I loved it. However the line to see the pandas was just too long.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Squirrel796
40,Nice,Enjoyed the time there .. although not amazing but you are going to spend a nice dayEspecially if you have children they will find a lot of attractions thereDon't miss the bird showBe prepared to walk .. it's not a place to relax .. but u may use the shuttle tram for 5$,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PeterHannaEshak
50,My son Jake Loves the zoo he would want to be there everyday.,"Get the membership it's so worth it. We go once and sometimes twice a week.My son loves the snakes, elephante, lion and tiger the monkeys and the petting zoo.We could be there for hours. We enjoy the hot dogs by the zebras. We take lots of picture of Jake we have been a member for a year and Jake just turned 3. He loves the news letters we get in the mail. Jake is a animal lover and dinosaurs too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Patty75c
30,LOS ANGELES ZOO,"A good way to spend 1/2 a day. After visiting the San Diego zoo, this zoo is kinda depressing. Animals are in smaller enclosures. There were tons of screaming, yelling camp kids in the park seeing it is summer time. Food is outrageously priced, bring your own. Save yourself a wait and buy your tickets online. This zoo needs to seek investors so it can expand.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/937kennethy
40,1st time - enjoyable,"While visiting family - took my first trip to the zoo LOL :)please note: the Zoo is pretty large and is hilly - can become quite a workout - especially if it is sunny / hotI would recommend:For kids 6 and under - bring along a carriageFor seniors (and even others) - if you have not been active for a while -this is going to be a ""workout""I enjoyed it - saw all the featured animalswould go back with the grand kids as they got olderIf they lived closer - I would have bought them a season passenjoy !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/m35yellowbrickrd
30,are there animals here?,"It is a long, hilly, hot walk between animal pens. Many of the animals were either sleeping or not even in their cage. The apes were enjoyable and could really see how human like they are. Food in the restaurants is expensive, except for the one that was closed. It was only $20 to get in, but my husband and I were thinking we should have spent more and went to the San Diego Zoo instead.If you pay with a credit card, have your ID with you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/68XXX70
10,Disappointed,"I can't believe I am writing a bad review for a zoo. First of all, horrible map and few signs. Come to a fork in Road and no idea so going in circles. Not carriage friendly. Saw so many hot couples struggling up hills. Very hot so had to look for animals. Run down and depressing areas for animals. Shows scheduled 30 minutes apart so impossible to find and get there in time. Skip it and watch National Geographic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shaynacharter
40,Grrreat Experience,"The L.A. Zoo is always a treat to visit. It’s a little hilly for older folks to navigate, but they have mobile carts to take folks around the various paths, and price for them is reasonable. I particularly like the snake exhibits – many species from around the world encased in up close glass enclosures (the deadly mamba snake was of particular interest).We went on a weekday, so the crowds were not overwhelming and we were easily able to view the various exhibits. It was a hot day, so the lions were mostly sleeping. I did get a great picture of them as they snoozed away (perhaps it will attach to my review).We decided to have shave ice cone because they looked so good on such a hot day; however, bees swarmed the shave ice stand constantly and it became a tricky maneuver to grab our cones. I felt bad for the guy working there!All of the animals looked well cared for and the occasional docents along the way were knowledgeable and passionate about the animals.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FrequentTraveller034
20,Typical,"Nothing special here. Animal exhibits sparse. Landscaping looks neglected.Signage not very clear.Thus place needs some upgrades which is probably very expensive. Major fundraising needed. I left feeling sorry for the animals.I will say we visited on a day that was very hot. Not a great place to be on a hot day. If you visit do it later in the day, although they close at 5:00.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E9260TNjudys
50,Definitely a way to get fit.,"It is worth the extra money to feed the giraffe. Our year membership has definitely been worth every penny. It is better to go when they 1st open or 2 hrs before they close, better parking. I advice starting from the left to see the animals. It seems more downhill if you come out on the right. A stroller is a must if you have a little one. We bring frozen water bottles. The playground is the best. There is plenty of shade & benches for adults, with bathrooms nearby.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/224tiffanyw
50,"Nice Day Trip to Zoo, not a Botanical Garden","We had the Go Card and wanted to see the koalas at the zoo. It was a very, very hot day.The staff at the zoo was great. We loved the harbor seals, tasmanian devil, koala bear, and the chimpanzees were going crazy this day.Lots of options for water, icees, etc.We were happy because we had not seen tasmanian devil or koalas on the east coast.We were able to see a training session with the harbor seals.Huge Komodo Dragon on display.Nice way to spend the morning.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/connief517
30,Not bad.... expensive,"As far as zoo's go, this one is ok ( first impression ) and has some great displays. I particularly liked the elephants. We went on an extremely hot day so many of the animals would not come out which was a little disappointing. Also.. they seem to charge a lot for what you get ( 20$ per adult ). If you take the tram just be advised its another 5$ per person and you cant see anything... they just take you to various stops around the outside. Overall it was so-so.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X2628OTmatth
40,great day,"Hadn't been to the zoo in 2 decades. Took my grand children on Thurs and we got there at 10:30am (traffic) and huffed it up the hill to make the Giraffe feeding at 11am. They could put signs out as to where that is located. Took us a bit to find it. Made it with 5 minutes to spare.I was a fun experience for the kids. Purple tongue. They loved it.Forgot the zoo is all up hill...wow. Lots of up and down hill walking, but the nice thing about this is that there are many beautiful old trees and lots of shade. We especially enjoyed the orangutan exhibit. Got a great look ad the males. Ginormous!The tram is nice, but it only goes around the outside circle of the park.We headed for the petting zoo on the way out, but it had already closed at 3:30pm. The zoo closes a 5pm....why? Try getting on the freeway that time of night. A nightmare. They should at least stay open to maby 7pm? Unfortunately some of the things we wanted to see were only on weekends like the hippo visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annette425
30,Well it's a zoo.,If you have never been to any zoo before then you will enjoy. As did we but I do think it's a little pricey for a zoo. I've visited many zoo's but LA zoo has always been the last on the list due to its higher price simply because it has the title of Los Angeles...The price for kids starts at 2 years old. Even Disneyland doesn't charge for 2 year olds. Kids should also be much less than adults. They are 25% cheaper.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mynameisgabriel
40,Great zoo,Visited with my son had a great time. Nice walking zoo! Easy to get in and out of... our favorites were the lemurs!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ak_childs
30,Could Be Better,"Our weekend in L.A. ended up being unseasonably hot, so we wanted to get to the zoo early. Unfortunately, it doesn't open until 10am. Try to get tickets in advance online if you can plan ahead so you don't have to wait in the long line at the ticket counter. We found a brochure at our hotel that had a discount coupon- that helped since adult admission is $17-20. There are a few shows, feedings and presentations at various times throughout the day, so check the schedule when you arrive if you're interested. We have been to zoos all over the U.S. and I was surprised that the zoo in a city the size of L.A. was not better than what it is. In most cases, the habitats seemed small and unattractive. Many were faux-rock concrete bowls with moats and fences disguised with shrubbery. The problem with the fences and walls is that it's difficult for people in wheelchairs and small children to see over a barricade that is 3' tall- especially if the shrubbery is not kept clipped back. I found it difficult to take photographs over the barricades or through the chain-link on a lot of enclosures. The rainforest area where the otters are and the Australian habitat seemed the nicest (maybe newest?). The plantings of unusual and exotic flora and the exceptional collection of raptors were the only things that elevated the zoo above ""ho-hum"" for us. The zoo grounds are very spread out so there is a lot of walking and there are some grades too because the zoo is on the side of a hill. A shuttle is available that circumnavigates the perimeter and stops at several locations; it's wheelchair-accessible and costs $2-5. The map of the zoo is not very exact or detailed and we found it frustrating to navigate. Apparently we weren't the only ones as a couple of bewildered families that we passed asked us for directions. We were turned off by the constant barrage of marketing to get you to spend more money. I felt sorry for the families with small children because they funnel the meandering pathways through a gauntlet of gift shops, souvenir stands, treat/snack kiosks and restaurants, then also invite you to buy tickets for the carousel (+$3) and feed the giraffe (+$5). There were even vendors at the entrance selling hats and umbrellas. We enjoyed our morning hike to see the animals and plants, but wouldn't return because we have 2 zoos within a couple of hours of us that are just as good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CrankingChick
40,Very good zoo,"This zoo is set up to give animals privacy if they need it. We went in the afternoon and many animals were sleeping, which is typical on a warm afternoon. I think the zoo really does a good job considering the animal needs. Very clean. I loved feeding the giraffe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/debsW3024QA
40,Glad we went!,"After reading reviews on this site about the zoo, we almost didn't go. A lot of people had said that they didn't see many animals on their visits. We went there on a Thursday, arriving in the morning. We had to stand in line for 15 or 20 minutes to get our tickets. We had our 5 year old grand daughter and it was a very warm day. We figured she wouldn't be able to walk long or far so we went looking for elephants, giraffes and big cats. In the end, we covered the entire zoo in about 5 hours. We saw every animal, except the bear and the snow leopard! One of the zoo employees said that most likely, the snow leopard was actually there, but it is just so good at blending into its environment that lots of people never see it, even though it is right there. We enjoyed visiting this zoo and we were so glad we went!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jocelynb643
50,Amazing,It was an amazing experience.Highly recommend. It was really nice experience. Need to go there again,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Destination714933
30,Very interesting experience,"As with most zoos, there are enclosures very up to date as well as some outdated ones.All in all i totally enjoyed the visit.What really impressed me, was the enclosure of the giant otters - rather large (compared to many other zoos' enclosures for similar animals), very well structured, they even had a 'natural' waterslide!As for the rest, i recommend you go there and see for yourself!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DorisHeimgartner
40,Vitamin Z Time,We were in town visiting family and celebrating my birthday and decided to take a trip to the zoo. Being that San Diego is a few hrs away from LA (with no traffic) the LA Zoo was the choice. Both of us had a good time and liked the fact of close proximity at some of the animal exhibits. You can buy a ticket pkg. for other tourists areas if you're going to be in town for awhile.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jayhoff
40,Good place to visit with kids,"This zoo is in a beautiful location and it is a good quality zoo. I don't know that this zoo has a unique animals, but they do a good display. This is a great place with kids and the staff was friendly and professional.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kyle_SD_308
50,Great way to spend the day,This was for my birthday and we got there early. I have been there years ago but it's always nice to go back. There is a tram you can take if you don't want to walk the whole way. It's $4 but it's worth it. Another thing you can do is pack a lunch and take it with you and there are plenty of picnic areas where you can eat and take a break. If it's sunny you are allowed to take an umbrella to block the sun. We had such a great time,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lucyvf
30,Disappointing,"Apart from a couple of notable exceptions, the LA Zoo looks tired and rundown. Not a very inspiring visit. Food options also limited and expensive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rossh482
50,Wonderful,A wonderful and affordable place to visit alone or with family and or friends.If you go early when they open you get to see and experience many activities and many different talks about animals. You can bring your own food and beverages The Zoo has different places on the shade where you can rest and enjoy your food and company/,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emilymW156QS
30,Okay,"The zoo is large, and the animals seem to be okay, for the most part. My biggest downfall with the zoo was the confusing layout. After consistently consulting my map for a couple of hours and having to backtrack constantly, I gave up and just wandered, hoping to see everything. Also (and at no fault of the zoo itself) it was extremely hot, so most animals were not on display. I would say maybe one in five animals were actually visible. Overall, I would try the zoo again if I was in LA, but on first impression, it was just okay.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VacationerGuy
50,Great trip,Great little zoo. You are able to see the animals without needing a binocular! We ate at the zoo grill very affordable and fresh.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/conanton
20,Depressing,"I was so looking forward to visiting the LA Zoo but was sadly disappointed, the animals looked depressed and the zoo was in disrepair although they making improvements it was depressing .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Berdy64
40,Family trip,"We visited the zoo 4/29/17 for the first time. Price was reasonable, exhibits were good. I recommend getting tickets on your smart phone to avoid about a 10-15 min wait - although the line was moving pretty quickly. Giraffe feeding was cool - although there was a long line. If you are going for the carousel - always good to check ahead to see if it is in operation. The tram for 4.00 is good if you have difficulty with walking a lot or uphill. Food was decent where we ate and not priced too crazily. They have spirits for sale as well. Docent was very informative at several locations.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marksG7602PN
50,Fun day for the family,"We took our 2 year old daughter here on a Sunday and this place was pretty busy. I didn't think that many people would be at the zoo. Parking was free which is a plus.There were quite a lot of animals to see. We paid to feed the giraffe but my daughter got scared and dropped the food before the giraffe got a chance to eat it. I picked it up and gave it to the giraffe.If you are planning to go, it is best to buy your tickets online so you don't have to wait in line at the zoo. There was a long line people waiting to buy their tickets. We printed the tickets at home and just walked right in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/swingonastar
40,Great experience,There are a wide variety of animals to see and it's convenient that outside food and drinks are allowed and there are plenty of tables and benches to eat at throughout the park. A downside is that some animals are not visible or present and some exhibitions are empty. The food is okay but like usual a little pricey so it's best to bring your own food.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/samanthabH2876KZ
50,This is a great zoo,"Great way to spend the day with family. Plenty of parking, and things to see.

50,A sunny day at Los Angeles County Arboretum and Botanical Garden,"A few minutes drive from Los Angeles off of Fwy 210, Los Angeles County and Arboretum and Botinical Garden greets you with their exhilarating colorful-feathered peacocks that spread its long tail with many imprinted eyes on it staring at you. Peacocks are found around the Peacock Cafe near the entrance and its immediate surrounding vicinity. Peacocks are not just the attraction in the Arboretum. As the word say, it is also Botical. Thousands of shrubs, plants and trees are here which are donated from all over the world that fills this 126-acre park. A $9.00 entrance fee for adults will consume your whole day here. They even have arts and craft programs for children too. You cannot go wrong with a $5.00 tram ride either. I suggest you buy the tram ride at the same time you pay for the entrance. Take the first tram at 12 noon - no hassle with other visitors there. Bring water and come early so you do not have to park to far. Parking is free!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Californiarey
40,Nice and Large Zoo,"This is a large zoo with a wide variety of animals. Be prepared to walk a lot! There is a shuttle that you use for $4; you get a wrist band and you can use it for the entire day. You won't see a lot of animals on the shuttle ride; it's really just to move you from one place to another,Most of the animals were available for viewing. The meerkats are always fun at this zoo! There is a bird show available as well as some other talks by zookeepers. We didn't sit in on those though. There was plenty to see otherwise.The zoo is directly across the street from a great museum, the Autry. It is in Griffith Park, which also houses the famous Griffith Observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FuzzyKat
50,Family Day at The Los Angeles Zoo,"Excellent day at the zoo! Great for couples, families, kids, and exercise! Tips: If you go on a warm day, try to get there when the zoo opens! Animals are more likely to be active in the morning! And be prepared for plenty of walking, uphill and down! If you are not into walking, the trams are available to get you around. If you like attending demonstrations or zoo talks, be sure to make a note of the times as soon as you arrive so that you don't miss them!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AndynRebecca
40,Came for the hippo tour; wandered around.,"The hippo tour was neat, a pretty exclusive opportunity! The group size was fairly small, price was reasonable, but it went SO fast! Was not a very long experience but we did get to touch and have a photo opportunity. The directional signs around the park were interesting as they didn't have words, only photos. Same with a map-not a great job conveying the amazing diversity of the animals showcased there. Bird show was cute, showcased some neat species. I also really enjoyed seeing the otters.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Brattybritt92
50,"spend a day, spend an hour - fun for the whole family","Many people will tout the value of the LA Zoo first, as it is one of cheapest ways to spend a day with as a family of four. However, I like the zoo because you get to see exotic animals and learn new things in the middle of one of the largest cities in the world. As an adult, you get a license to be a kid again, running from one animal to the next, stuffing your face with fresh cooked kettle corn and dodging strollers as you hurry to the Bird Show.They have special events throughout the year for kids and discounts if you are a member.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gazelle27
30,Very disappointing,"Not sure why they call it zoo and botanical gardens. There were no garden displays. The zoo is small compared to the San Diego zoo. My husband purchased shuttle tickets and is obviously a senior were sold normal priced tickets$4 each. The shuttle was supposed to run every 15-20 minutes actually ran every 30-35. That is a long wait when it's hot and your feet are tired. It runs around the perimeter, so you CAN'T SEE ANY ANIMALS from the shuttle.Many of the animals are in their shelters so that can be disappointing. The giraffes were out, thankfully. Even having taken the shuttle, there is still a lot of uphill climbing to try to see any animals. Overall disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/351priscillag
20,Disappointed,I am not sure if it is money or animal treatment but the collection is not what it was years ago. Poor displays and info re animals and scant animals. So disappointed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lindam856
50,Great place,"Great place to take the family, few activies inside the zoo like face painting,shuttle,small park,specially lots of animals the kids will love to see .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/146cindyg
30,I guess I'm a zoo snob,"I'm someone who grew up going to the Bronx zoo then I moved to D.C. and the National Zoo became my standard. In comparison, LA's zoo was dated and many of the animal enclosures were not an appropriate size. One exception was the giraffe exhibit. It was fabulous. I have never seen so many giraffes all at one time 5-6? A lot! Worth it if you want a day outside. We walked the entire zoo in about 2 1/2 hours. Easy to access by bus. The bus stops right at the front gate.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kathya615

50,Visit with my daughter and young grandkids,"We visited on a Thursday and there were many school busses there! Luckily my daughter, 8 mths pregnant and 2 kids ages 3 & 5, had season passes (so no long line). The zoo is well organized. We only stayed a few hours and were not able to see all the animals. The kids walked so no stroller parking. We saw the bird show and enjoyed it. Worth a trip to this zoo!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bettijg

30,It was too small,The areas for the animals just looked to small for them. No room to run a few steps . I thought the zoo was average. The San Diego safari park is way bigger and has a lot more activities.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lisamO3510VV
50,What a beautiful zoo,We really enjoyed the LA Zoo! We went on a Tuesday and there weren't that many people there!We rented a motor scooter for my grandmother and discovered the Zoo is very accessible.We went right as the Zoo opened and enjoyed see most of the animals being very active.The only issue we had was going during spring break and have lot of busses full of kids arriving. The groups had kids running and screaming with the teachers not caring. Other than that I loved the LA Zoo,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shadyhellman
20,So few animals!!,"The zoo was clean, nicely laid out and it was nice that you could get beer and wine at some of the food options. However, so many of the enclosures were either empty or had 1-2 animals in them. It was especially ridiculous in the elephant enclosure that was HUGE and said it had elephants from 3-4 different countries. We walked around and around to try to find even one and finally saw a glimpse of one elephant walking around. 2 meer kats - sad. 2 lions. 2 monkeys. We went to every since enclosure and left quite disappointed. Not worth it at all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Loridog94
40,Lovely way to spend a Sunday morning,We arrived well before opening time. Lots of free parking. Was very busy. Consider purchasing tickets before going as we stood in a long line to purchase ours but the line did move at a reasonable pace. Lots of families visiting the day we were there. Lots of people purchasing food and drinks at the zoo. Zoo is spread out but easy to navigate. A good variety of animals and a few had babies when we visited. We really enjoyed our visit and would happily visit again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eeyoreBrisbane
30,"Good zoo, and easy to walk around.","The zoo is a good little break in the day, and we spent a couple of hours walking around. Some animals were taking a break and weren't in their habitats, and others had dirty class to look through. So, I'd say maintenance is only okay, but it's clean and enjoyable, and was a little bit of tranquility, which we detoured to see, since we were nearby doing other things. It's not one of the best zoos you'll see, but it's good enough.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/5gordons
40,Zoo Lights,We went to the holiday-season zoolights and the youngest family member enjoyed it. A large part of the zoo is closed during the evening show of course.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WestwoodTrekker
50,Much bigger than I was expecting!,My husband and I used go LA cards on our trip and this was one of the places we could visit on them. (Totally recommend the go la cards to anyone. Saved us loads of money!)I was pleasantly surprised at the huge amount of animals that are on show here at the zoo. Everything from lions and elephants to frogs and reptiles.The zoo is set out on a loop that took my husband and I approx 2 1/2 hours to complete at a leisurely pace.We went on a weekday so the place was full of school kids but that didn't affect us at all.Overall really enjoyed our afternoon.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CSSmith5
50,Great zoo - worth the visit to hear the unusual sounds of the gibbons,We recently visited the zoo and aside from the usual zoo exhibits we were lucky enough to hear the gibbons making their very loud and unusual sounds. It is hard to even describe but do not miss an opportunity to experience this sound live. I have visited many zoos and I would say this is a very good zoo.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jsachanda
50,Run out of things to do in LA ?? Try the Zoo,"Spend a day at the LA Zoo. Located in Griffith Park, it is easy to find, ample free parking, and worth a visit. It is quite spread out, so bring your walking shoes. You will log several miles as you wonder thru all the exhibits. No end of lively animals in natural settings, with many, many handlers keeping everything fed, clean and orderly. Highly recommend it for a lovely, outside adventure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KatyS610
40,Lots of interesting animals,"We were in the area with our grandchildren and decided to check out the LA Zoo. We did not have high expectations and were pleasantly surprised by the size of the zoo and the variety of animals. There is a reptile house with several varieties of snakes and lizards on display. There is also a komodo dragon exhibit which my grandchildren found fascinating. There are several kangaroos in the kangaroo enclosure and at least one had a baby in its pouch. We were pleasantly surprised to find quite a few species of animals that we had never heard of before, such as the long-nosed Echidna, Duiker, Gerenuk and Peccary. The elephants were not out on the day we went. There were several chipmanzees and they were quite entertaining. We went on a Saturday and there were several presentations around the zoo at different times. The zoo did not seem particularly crowded on a Saturday in February. It is large enough to spend at least several hours looking at the exhibits. There were several dining options with typically overpriced food. We were given a scavenger hunt on entry that engaged my 7 year old granddaughter throughout our visit as she looked for the ""code"" on various exhibits to tell her what circle to scratch off and reveal a word once all the letters were disclosed. I would say this is a great way to spend the better part of a day with kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hippely
50,Fabulous value to visit the Los Angeles Zoo and Gardens,"We were looking for a value visit on a nice sunny day - and choose the LA Zoo at $17 for seniors (over 62). It did not disappoint ! Plenty of animals, small and large - many I had not seen before. The compounds were all clean with plenty of space and we had a very enjoyable 4 hours. A great family trip!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/953jim
40,Was a nice place just went on too hot of a day,"We got there later than intended due to the buses, but we got too see everything.took the tram to the top then made our way down.just picked too hot of a day to go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ledbytheunknown
30,Thought provoking,"Visited on a Saturday afternoon for an afternoon out. Although I had a nice time I couldn't help but feel that a large number of the animals, especially the lions, tigers and the rest of the big cats, had very small enclosures that are not suitable for animals of their size. Overall I felt that the zoo was quite run down with a lot of the animals pacing up and down against the cages looking very stressed - not a pleasant site to see",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G0LDY24
30,A Midsize Zoo for Families,"This is a very nice Zoo with interesting animals. The visit was limited and I am sure we missed some key highlights. Most will find the zoo walkable if they are comfortable with the modest hills. There were 5 exhibits I really enjoyed: gorillas, monkeys, tigers, baby giraffe and hippopotamuses. Elephants were not in sight.Although lots of cement, these exhibits provided a clear view of the animals, while many other exhibits made seeing the animals more difficult.Food at the zoo was available for about the same price as other zoos I have visited. The quality of the food exceeded expectations.This is a midsize zoo good for families.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A6847QPmarcs
40,A good zoo,"We visted this zoo with our 16 month old daughter. She was happy to see animals like giraffes, zebra , gorila etc. The zoo needs a lot of walking and some in very hilly areas. There are good number of eating joints and eating areas on the way but they are bit overpriced. There is a tram around the park to enjoy zoo if ur not much intrested to walk. We spend around 1.5 hours there as little one got tired but one can easily spend half day there visiting and enjoying animals at ease and enjoying the show which they conduct. A good place for everyone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mansi_Vij
50,just for fun,"We went to the L.A. Zoo today (2/4/17), Just to get out of the house, plus the weather was nice for it too. We are zoo members also. Which if you live in the area is not a bad deal. Today I took my 1 year old to feed the giraffe and she absolutely loved it!Then right afterwards we did the elephant encounter.We love taking our little one to the zoo she is so fascinated by the animals as well.Staff is very nice and knowledgeable about the animals.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/332evieb
50,Very good zoo,I took my kids here for the day with my sister and we had a blast walking around all the exhibits and enclosures.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CaribbeanFan79
40,Not as good as San Diego,"A good zoo, but, not as good as San Diego. A good expansive zoo set on a hill, so, expect a good amount of hill walking, While we were there, it was pretty busy as it was a holiday, and there was only one zoo bus available, with a huge queue. It's worth noting that the bus is not free.A good selection of animals and displays although a lot of them were hard to spot in the large enclosures with a large amount of visitors",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FullFonz
40,"Large, beautiful zoo and garden","Our first time at this 50 year old, 133 acre zoo. It is massive with alot of walkways, some in very hilly areas. Because of it is also a garden with many desert plants it is pleasant and much is shaded. Although they give you a map, it is confusing because in some places there are no signs directing you or the signs are inadequate. There are regular shows throughout the day with the highlight the spectacular 15 minute World of Birds show. Great animal areas, especially elephants, giraffes and apes. There is a tram around the park for $4, which we did not take and about 6 to 8 eating areas with restrooms. Food was expensive and quality was fair. Admission is $20 for adults and $18 for seniors. They are members of the American Zoological Association so if you are a member of another zoo, your admission is half price.Another plus--there is free parking, although closer preferred parking costs $8. You could spend a whole day here and not see everything. A lovely, interesting place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pnemiller
40,Nice zoo,"We had a great time at the zoo esp the kids. Lots of variety of animals and also plants, cactus and flowers. Love the different country settings and houses also like india, thailand, cambodia, australia It felt like youve been to diff places",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pao186
30,Just ok,This zoo is dilapidated and needs a lot of work. Most of the animal exhibits are falling apart. A lot of empty enclosures without animals. It was fun one time but I wouldn't come back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelMaverick29
50,Great day out at the zoo!,Visiting our grandson in LA and just back from the zoo. Great day out! Although it may be a bit pricey for some ($55 for all of us) the up sides are free parking and you can bring in your own food/drinks. Large enough but not too large. Animals looked well and were quite lively. Saw the elephant show and the little one loved it. We easily spent 2.5 hours there and could have done more. Enjoy!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GolferPeg
30,LOS ANGELES ZOO & BOTANICAL GARDENS,"This zoo is ok. I have visited it, at least 4 times, in the last year. If you have a family and live in the area, it is worth buying a pass. It is big and at times, the animal enclosures are not very close to each other. If people have difficulty walking, I would suggest using their tram (additional cost) or a wheelchair. The terrain is not even. Some of the enclosures you can reach, by walking up hill. The food is ok. It is overpriced and I would suggest bringing your own lunch and snacks.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/USCLCP
40,Very Large City Zoo In Griffith Park,The LA Zoo is spread out over a rolling hilly landscape in Griffith Park. The animal exhibits are really excellent and the docents and staff are very well informed if you ask them questions. It is a massive zoo and walking around it is quite the workout. They do have a small train type shuttle for those who don't want to walk.The zoo gets very busy and crowded in weekends with families and small children so if you don't want to fight the crowds a mid week visit might be best.I have been visiting the zoo for years and always enjoy wandering around there. The Giraffe and Chimp exhibits seem to be the big crowd pleasers but there is plenty more to see.Parking is free ( a rarity in LA) and admission is $20 for adults. Lot's of concessions and gift shops inside.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bccrab
30,LA Zoo Lights,"L.A. Zoo Lights is a seasonal evening event at the LA Zoo. They have a designated part of the zoo where there are decorative lights and displays to check out. The only animals you really get to see are the reindeer in which you can also have a photo opp with! There is also an area with reptiles for viewing as well. It was cool to check out, but I do think it is better suited for families with young children. I had visited the Descanso Gardens Enchanted Forest days before attending this and it paled in comparison.Tip: Buy your tickets in advance to avoid the worst of the entry lines. I purchased my tickets online and they sent me mobile tickets which was very seamless. Wear comfortable shoes; the lights only cover about a third of the zoo grounds, but you'll be walking slightly uphill for most of the way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rona_Michels
50,Holiday Lights at the Zoo,Go in the evening to view the lights at the zoo. The animals are asleep but the lights turn on for a magical fantasy evening. Stroll through different themes and canopies of lights and watch the lights synchronized to music. Unlike lights you will see anywhere else. Perfect for a family with kids of all ages or a romantic evening with your significant other.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/loisw65
50,Winter is a great time to visit the animals!,We took advantage of the cooler temps to visit the zoo and were very happy to see all the animals out and about. This is a great time to take pictures if you like photography as well. We went on a very crowded day - we arrived about an hour after the zoo opened and parked in one of the last rows. Kudos to the zoo - we were also pleasantly surprised by how well the zoo handles crowds - lots of people but we could see everything,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christineess
50,Lovely visit,We visited the zoom whilst visiting la and was very impressed with the animals and the way the zoo is arranged. It a very nice interesting walk. It's a great place to take the kids.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Duskman554
40,nice for kids,"really nice for kids, have lots of activities but in the morning and my girls never get up so we have missed it the 2 times we have been there. Animals seems well taken care. must take food for kids unless you want the un healthy fast food. but they let big coolers so best is to set up a good healthy picnic for kids",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bachues
30,Holiday Lights weren't all that good.,"We took our kids to see the lights at the Zoo and I was kind of disppointed. For the price it cost to enter, I expected more. Especially since we had to pick a time. I thought there was going to be a show or something. For the price of admission, they should've thrown in tickets to come back within 30 days to see the animals.Overall, the Zoo itself is neat, but the lights aren't really worth the cost.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelmom6306
50,A lot of fun,The LA zoo is a great place for everyone. Lots of beautiful grounds to walk around and enjoy. A lot of activity for the animals. The staff give them something different to encourage them to play and interact for visitors. Handicap friendly. A lot of parking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/511annr
30,Average Zoo,"The LA Zoo is huge in term of landscape, has a variety of species, and very good gift shops. Yet, the huge area could be a negative point about it, long walks and it feels like some part of the area is not necessarily used properly. I had to spend two hours of walking, with a 5 years old kid who got bored and certain times.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/466ahmedj
40,A Hidden Gem.,"Having planned to spend a day at Universal Studios and failing to get a ticket it was suggested we didn't waste the drive and go to the zoo. My cousin, who is local, hadn't been there since he was a kid and told us not to expect too much.However we were very pleasantly surprised. The entry cost was very reasonable compared to lots of attractions in the area. I was in a wheelchair and although the road track was gravelly and the plot was slightly hilly in places it was not difficult to access any of the areas.There were a great variety of animals, insects, snakes to see. There was a bit of a wasp issue by the slushy seller but he had them on him as he was serving and they didn't bother him.It was a nice walk in countryside with the added bonus of the creatures!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FamilyCW
30,A great day out for the whole family,"I had the pleasure of visiting this zoo with my husband. Got to the zoo just before the opening time where a line had already formed to get into the zoo. Ticket prices are good for a zoo and significantly cheaper than some other attractions in the LA area.The Christmas decorations and lights are a great festive addition to the zoo and I feel like it would look awesome at the night viewing.There was a good range of animals from across the world. However I found that a lot of animals were not on display. Fair enough that not all animals can be out at all times, however it just felt like a lot were missing.There is a couple of food options in the zoo, however I consider the pricing to be high for what the food items are.Overall I was surprised with the standard of the zoo, it was all clean and well presented. Definitely a good day out for all ages.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thetravelinggirl1
20,Sad old style zoo,"The Zoo surprised us....it was the 60th anniversary we were told by guests and did it ever show its age. Much of the path was between concrete walls. Places to spend more money were plentiful along each path. Windows for aquatic animals, otters, and such were very dirty making any photography difficult. Most disappointing were the cages for many of the animals, the old style wire cages that arent used much any more. The social animals used to a large area seemed depressed. Some of the larger animals, e.g. elephants are more open space partly, I guess, for the ""animal shows"" that were put on. Modern zoos dont do much of that any more. I thought there was an aviary but, if there was, we werent able to find it. We did find a enclosed stage for ""bird shows"" but we didnt attend. The ""botanical garden"" isnt a garden in the usual sense of the term, mostly scattered plants or trees on little islands along the concrete paths. I may be being too critical having seen modern zoos in other places. And, the large number of families with small children seem to enjoy the outing. Modernizing the zoo would be a very expensive proposition but one can hope.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bilsue
20,I got in at half price & it still was disappointing...L.A.Zoo.. What a waste.,"Well, I'll start off by saying that if you're taking little kids, I suppose this place is just fine. But for older children & adults, to me, this was an example of why there shouldn't be zoos that don't have plenty of room for their animals.It was the 50th Anniversary of the Zoo, and I saw on TV that is was half price ( $8.50 adult). Since I hadn't been in over 30 years, I decided it was time... I got there about 11am, and as I started to walk, it all just seemed so ""20th Century""... Just too, well....sad.I stayed for an hour and a half, and found the layout sort of confusing (but maybe that's just me). And, for it being a ""Celebration Day"", over half the animals I looked for, weren't out.The poor hippos in their cement pond, rhino just looking bored to tears, the orangutans kind of ratty, the leopard in a wooden box, a majestic eagle in a wire cage just sitting....the flamingos sort of trapped in the SAME size pool I saw 30 yrs ago.I can't imagine taking a family of 4 & not being bummed...They consider an 'adult' as THIRTEEN and older ($20) and kids TWO to 12 $17.00.. I mean REALLY?? That's borderline criminal.So, for me...if U want to give your kids an education about how Zoos maybe shouldn't be around anymore & that animals need ROOM to LIVE.....then ok.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lagreek1
50,Awesome Zoo! Many animals! Accommodates large amounts of people!,"Brought our granddaughters to the LA Zoo! So worth it! Impressive how many animals, reptiles! We went when they opened (10am) so all the animals were active and out for us to see! We walked thru the zoo in approx 2-3 hrs. Lots of fun for all ages!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F3981FJpatriciak
50,An unexpected pleasure!,"We always visit zoos when we travel. Because the Los Angeles zoo is lesser known than many, we didn't know what to expect. Much to our delight, we enjoyed every part of it. Billie, the 30-year old Indian elephant, is one of the most beautiful of his kind. Other unique animals also amazed us. Most of the habitats were above par and the zoo had beautiful, lush plant life. Much walking is required, so be prepared by wearing comfortable shoes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/katrac23
40,Beautiful display of Christmas lights if you are not disabled,"This was fantastic!! Best light show I have ever experienced. However, before entering the reptile building there is a rock stairway which I did not see and my husband stumbled down. It was dark and unmarked by signage or contrast strips. It was also missing handrails. Very dangerous. A lot of the pathways are not marked for ADA and definitely are not ADA compliant. There should be some sort of transportation available for this special event for disabled persons because it is not compliant.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/princess5
40,Great place for kids and adults,"The LA Zoo has improved since our last visit quite a few years ago. The exhibit areas have many improvements and they are better for the visitors and also appear to be better for the animals on display. The elephant exhibit area is now very expansive and allows for the elephants to roam around; it also provides good opportunities for guests to see them. There are a lot of animals to be seen. No, it's not the San Diego Zoo, but it's not a 2 or 3 hour drive either. The grandchildren really enjoyed the experience and they also really liked the carousel inside the zoo. The food was also very good, which was a pleasant surprise.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/geotech522
50,Amazing Zoo!!,"LA Zoo is wicked!! There are soo many different animals, birds and reptiles, my wife and i had an absolute blast!! It took us about 4 hours to go through the zoo thoroughly",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shagg2016
50,Surprise and great trip!,"We heard bad things on other sites and were very skeptical going, but it was AWESOME! I would highly recommend this to anyone. The animals were wonderful, they seemed happy and healthy. It's a lot of walking, so be prepared. We got to see so many animals and the layout was great.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrsmommy24
40,"A wonderful days' outing for couples, families and kids or just by yourself.","I am always amazed no matter how many times I go to the zoo, it is still so wondrous - all different shapes, sizes, colors, patterns of so many different animals/species from all over the world. They have different sections of different continents.This is what you'll see here at the LA Zoo. you can take a train that can drop you off at certain points if it's too much walking or even if you just wish to see the general sites whilst sitting. There is a small extra charge for this.Don't miss the children's part of the zoo near the entrance. Many people miss it but it's great. Kid's can pet the goats and sheep - more of a hands on experience.There's a few shops of course near the entrance and a few places to purchase food etc.If you're into walking in general or just want to walk for exercise sake, it's a great place. If you're not used to it, you may get a little tired after some time. They have kiddies carriages to hire I believe, also perhaps wheel chairs - but do check on that one.Go and have a great day!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shoshanah546
40,Such a great zoo for young children,"We really enjoyed our time here. It's very quiet during the week so it's a great place for young children. My 2-year-old daughter loved the petting zoo, where she was able to brush the goats and sheep.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sflaherty
50,Great historic zoo,"Plenty of parking. Prices are decent. Great for a day out. Lots of walking, or they do have a tram. Great assortment of animals, and reptiles. Make a day of it. Great location in Griffith Park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Props555
20,Zoo visit,"Disappointed with the number of animals. Many cages were empty. The enclosures were very small and there was no way the animals could play as many were on their own. The jaguars, in particular, seemed very stressed. Food outlets not too bad but no hot drinks available, which would have been nice as it was pouring with rain.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/firework05
20,DON'T DO IT,The animals are so sad that it makes you sad. Pack animals are in cages by themselves. Just don't do it,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/teresas330
50,Beautiful and huge zoo,"We visited this zoo today before going to oure hotel. The zoo is beautiful and huge, with lots of different animals. Some of the exhibits seem small-ish, but others are great (like the chimps). Spend a good 3.5 hours here. The dinosaur exhibit was great and well worth the money!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Marahx
50,Good place to take kids,This is a nice zoo for a day trip. They have a large variety of animals (some I never heard of). They have lots of demonstrations going on. The petting farm is limited to goats basically. The French fries and pizza near the giraffe exhibit were excellent.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/545kareno
50,Happy faces,"A delight, the kids where impressed and it took about 4 hours to go around all the park. From resting area to drinks stand this attraction is a must for kids",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/839michelm
50,Brilliant day,"Thought entry price reasonable. Very large zoo, good selection of animals, you do tend to back track to see everything. There is a train at a charge which stops at different parts of the zoo. They have a fun dinosaur exhibition at a small charge. Information when you enter about feeding and exhibition times. Lots of places to get drinks and snacks and meals. Gift shop and stroller rental. Staff very helpfully and pleasant.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pam920
50,Great place for kids,We went for the special dinosaur exhibit they had. Well worth the extra 5 dollars. My son had such a blast looking at all the animals. My daughter loved the elephants and Australian exhibit. I liked the tram that for a small cost you can ride to different parts of the park and back so worth it. Worth the cost.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/276justins
30,Some Animals You Don't See at Every Zoo,"The layout of the zoo does not flow smoothly-there is much backtracking to see everything, but if you are interested in certain areas, the map shows just where they are so you can skip the rest. The tram was not open on time when we entered the zoo right after opening time and a long line had formed. We did not use the tram, so can't judge waiting times, etc. I can't remember most of the animals we saw here that we missed in other zoos, but the cassowary of New Zealand is there. In some areas the actual viewing area is very narrow, so on busy days it would be hard to get near the fence, etc to see the exhibits. They have very good static displays that explain the relationship between the animals and plants. A great reptile area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/grip652
30,Not very kid friendly,"The zoo has the usual set of exhibits and some of them are well done. For example, the animated dinosaurs. Most every exhibit, however, has a 3 ft+ high hedge around it making it necessary to lift up smaller children. Add to that the very steep mountain that the zoo is located on and you get a full day of exercise. BTW, the restaurant at the very beginning of the zoo is by far the best in the whole park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DaveS42
40,Day trip,"Took my kids here while my husband had a meeting for work. We went end of Septemeber and my kids were hot and tired after an hour. Ages 4-7. There are many hills so climbing will happen. However, there were also many drinking fountains on one side of the zoo. I completely missed the gardens. Where were they? Also we come from the NW and I thought the price was unreasonable, however I just thought perhaps that was big city prices. I guess if you are local and buy a year membership it would be alright.Kids loved all the animals. If we would have been willing to spend more we could have taken the trolley and seen the dinosaurs (at our local zoo they had the dinosaurs as a free attraction set out all over the zoo).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wanderlustanni
30,The Animals Were Better Behaved Than The Humans,"I would sum up the visit to the Los Angeles Zoo as - acceptable. Very surprising that a city the size of Los Angeles has a zoo that is no obviously in need of updating. The employees all were very helpful and sincere but there is only so much they can do when the zoo needs more funding.The price was quite reasonable compared to other zoos we have visited. $20 or less per person. At no time did we feel unsafe, but we did find ourselves looking over our shoulders and holding tight to our wallets.The animal pens (or should we say cages), seemed like the type you would have seen 20 years ago.Come on Los Angeles, you can do better than this.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevefO6617ST
30,A trip to the zoo,"I had not been here in many years. It was quite nice, a lot of changes and upgrades, but to be honest, after seeing the San Diego Zoo, this zoo was for the most part, just average. It is a nice place to spend the day, while in Los Angeles and the price to get in is very reasonable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wallis642
50,Great Zoo Day!,"I loved this Zoo it was very spacious and plenty of shade all around. This size is so large there is trolly car that makes rounds to take people from animial habitat to animal habitat. Everything was well put together and designed to educate as well as entertain. There is a big park for little ones, plenty of drink stops where you can purchase snacks and or drinks. Alot of the animals were very entertaining. The tazmanian devils were running a marathon. Literally running little paths for long strechs of time, they were soo cute. My 15 year old daughter and myself made a day of this and really enjoyed our time here. This zoo is a good time for the whole family and is reasonably priced.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/499BarbaraH
30,At least the animals are cute!,I went on a hot day so that was my fault- the lines were still long to get in and it's pretty expensive! I didn't actually see any botanical gardens so that was slightly disappointing. The highlights for me were the elephants and monkeys!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/247maddyw
50,Wild day out,"We have been to our fair share of zoos and almost didn't go to this one because we have gone to so many in the last few months. This one was huge!You could really spend most of the day there. It doesn't close until 5 but they start putting the animals away at 4 so you want to be done before then.We heard the sea lions barking, river otters arguing, a couple of Tasmanian Devils ""fighting"" over meat like dogs, and saw a giraffe and zebra very close up.The koalas weren't out when we were there and one of the indoor Australia exhibits was closed. If you want to see everything in one day it is quite a trek.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Peglerd
50,A little ZOO that has a lot to Show and Deliver,"Okay so where should I begin? This ZOO is amazing, growing up in So Cal I always thought that if you wanted to go to a great ZOO and see amazing animals you needed to head down south to San Diego. But that is not the case anymore, the Los Angeles ZOO is amazing and a great place to take little ones. Don't get me wrong the San Diego ZOO's are great, but to have this so close and for it to be so affordable it is just awesome. The Los Angeles ZOO is so nice and clean, the Animals exhibits are beautiful and the ZOO staff is very helpful and awesome. I am telling you people that if you and your kiddo's need a ZOO Animal fix and do not want to drive all the way down south to San Diego then this is the place to go. It is Cheep and and fun and the park is not a back breaker with regards to the amount of walking you half to do. This place is AWESOME and is a great place to go on a date or to bring the family.. Thank you LA ZOO you are amazing...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/787kevinp
40,Enjoyment for adults and kids,"I went there with my nephew (5 years) and nieces (13-14 years) and sister (36 years) and they all just had fun. Its a huge place, you would need +2 hours, so if you don't have much time I would suggest you to come here another time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/466ahmedj
40,Zoo Trip,"I recently visited the LA Zoo for a school project and I was disappointed because the Panthers, the koalas, and the elephants weren't out. Other than that it was a good experience. They have a lot of unique habitats and a great variety of reptiles which I really enjoyed. Different parts of the zoo represent different countries and animals that are native to that country. It was clean and the staff were friendly. It's a good way to spend an afternoon with friends or family for sure. Also a plus was that there were plenty of trees around the park to shield us from the blazing sun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ldmccoy09
50,A Walk in the Park -- with Wild Animals!,"I never tire of the L.A. Zoo, which features spacious animal enclosures connected by broad walkways that are lush with vegetation and shaded by eucalyptus trees and bamboo groves -- a perfect destination for a family outing. The amazing orangutans have a huge open place to play, as do the chimps and the gorillas. Special exhibits like ""The Lair,"" filled with desert creatures, and ""Rainforest of the Americas,"" with animals from howler monkeys to river otters, offer a way to experience a whole environment, not just one animal at a time. Don't miss the timed ""shows,"" such as one in which handlers groom and talk about the elephants. My favorite show is the ""World of Birds,"" in which zookeepers introduce their largest and most intelligent birds -- eagles, hawks, falcons and more -- that swoop over the heads of people sitting in the bleachers, taking your breath away. Kids love the beautifully restored carousel, where for $3, you can ride on a horse, a zebra, a giraffe -- even a mouse!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JulioGM_Aqua
40,Very good but...,"I decided to give this zoo a 4 because it is a great place to see wild animals. The big trees along the walkways are beautiful and serene. Lots of food places and snack shacks through out the zoo, prices seemed pretty decent compared to a typical theme park. Though it does have a lot of hills to walk up to see different areas it is kind of worth it. There is a tram you can take but it charges a fee for a ride. I say ""kind of"" because most of the animals we saw were asleep or just laying around. And we got there when it opened, at 10. Now, I know this is out of the zoos control, but it just made me realize how sad it actually is that these animals might just be miserable. Stuck in a confined space, not able to roam free. Like the HUGE condor bird we saw. Such a beautiful bird, in such a small space that can't fly and spread its giant wings like it should be able to. A zoo is a great concept but the reality is, in some animals you can actually see the sadness in their eyes. It was just about heartbreaking. But should you go, you will see amazing animals and beautiful landscape.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amyt234
20,Very disappointing,We went for something different on a Saturday afternoon. Terrible dodger game traffic. Very disappointed in the lack of animals to see. Those that were there seemed sedated. Lethargic. It was a summer day but not that hot. Still very disappointed. Good for small kids but not much there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RonaldM876
50,One of the best. Totally under-rated.,"We have never had a bad time here. The zoo is open and clean and so much fun. They have something for everyone...young or old. Spend half a day there, its well worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/24mt24
40,Good zoo.,Nice facilities. Great layout. Good variety. Helpful staff. Children friendly. Lots of nearby free parking. Easy to get to.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NZTrips
30,"bears, monkeys, lions oh my.",Take plenty of water sunscreen and wear sunglasses and a hat. Fun day walking around the zoo looking at and read about the many different animals at the zoo. The zoo goes up hill so prepare to get plenty of exercise. Rail pass is 4 bucks s piece and came in handy. Don't forget to bring your zoo coupon to save a few dollars. I had an enjoyable day at the zoo.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/azcheesefan
50,The Best Time Of Day To Go Is...,"...early morning. Why? You'll have a better chance at seeing the Lions Roar, Chimpanzees and Razorbacks in full activity. Zoo open at 10, so get there at 9:30am. Also beat the crowds and it feels like we were the only ones there for a full hour. Bonus to getting there early is meeting hobbyist photographers in line who also get there early. These hobbyists have inside info on he animals, so be sure to strike up a conversation while waiting to get in. A hobbyist told us that there was a new tiger, 8 months old on display. When we got there, that tiger was putting on quite a show in the water. There are also a handful of regulars. Really was an honor to meet several of them. Got a Fitbit? Bring it and prepare to do at least 10,000 steps.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Crupi
40,Bring your walking shoes!,"I would plan a trip to the Zoo on a day that is not too hot because there is a lot of walking.The Australia area is very entertaining - make sure to carefully check out the pouches of the kangaroos and koalas, you just might catch a glimpse of a little one.The gorillas and chimps are a must see!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/572pamm
20,I thought a zoo should have animals !,"Went there today as part of our LA Go Card (which is really great by the way).The zoo covers a lot of ground and, as others have said here, it isn't very logically laid out. You need a comfortable pair of shoes because you can cover a lot of ground during your visit.To say we were unimpressed is an understatement. We were warned the lions couldn't be viewed (which they're were...great bonus!) but about 60% of the outdoor exhibits appeared empty. Yes, I know it was hot but apart from the giraffes, zebra and antelope we didn't get to see much else. It was so dire that, by the time we got half way around, we gave up and headed for the exit. That was bad enough but I would have been gutted had we paid $55 to get in !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/952neilj
40,Be prepared to walk,"This is a pretty good zoo, not the best, but good for a family day out. The layout is not always the most logical. Wear comfortable shoes because there is a lot of walking - this may seem obvious but I always see someone struggling in high heels. Book tickets online in advance to avoid the lines. My only disappointment was a lack of vegetarian options at the food places (other than the usual cheese pizza).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FionaYB
40,"Decent zoo, fun day","Nice zoo with a decent selection of animals, but rather pricey for what it is, I think. If you're only visiting LA, it's worth a visit. If you have a chance to head down to San Diego, I would vastly recommend their zoo over LA.That being said, it can be a fun day, especially for the kids. It's often very hot up there, so wear sunscreen and cool clothes. Rainy days are the best because there are no crowds, you beat the heat and the animals are excited for the weather.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EmBentley
50,Fun day,"We had a great time at the zoo. It was very hot and has some steep terrain so make sure to wear comfortable shoes and drink plenty of water. Loved the hippos, the Lair, and the new elephant exhibit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Inspire573689
50,Good Zoo,Visited today and still impressed as I was 28 years ago. Daughter got to see Kola bear for the first time and Tazamian Devil. Lovely load out zoo and easy to get round.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/UkManchestergirl
50,Great zoo,Went there with kids. It is very nice zoo with unique animals. Very clean and comfortable. It is places to sit everywhere and bathrooms very easy to find. We sow birds show what was very well done. Animals are healthy and stuff helps to find them if there are hiding.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Larissaandkids
40,Animals and Walking,"For those who remember the LA Zoo of their youth, it has DEFINITELY changed and for the better.The main entrance now looks like Jurassic Park and they also have a ""Main Street"" with stores and a restaurant. Definitely more appealing that what it was years ago.Animal exhibits have been upgraded, and the Elephant viewing area has been expanded. Be ready to walk as the Zoo sits up on a hill and viewing areas are elevated. Animals like humans don't like the heat so if you go on a hot day, don't expect to see many animals.Aside from that, the kids will love this place!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gcfam79
50,Zoo,Great place to bring the kids. The zoo looked well maintained and cleanliness was on point. Will be back again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Roldanski
50,L.A. Zoo is a must see.,L.A. Zoo is such fun for all ages. Make sure you have comfortable walking shoes. The animals are amazing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/457EstherK
30,Not worth it!,"Upon ticket purchase the sign informed us that the tiger exhibit was the only one closed, due to maintenance or what not. Well, upon our journey about 70% of the exhibits were empty, and the animals that were missing were all the good ones. Needless to say we were less than thrilled with our trip. I would highly recommend saving the money and doing something else.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jdressel1
30,OK Zoo,"Good to visit if you are in that part of Town, but I wouldnt go out of the way to visit. In saying that, I am comparing it to Singapore and San Diego Zoos- and these are some of the best in the world. Its a nice modern Zoo. Just not spectacular.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BenHancock
30,Good introductory zoo,"We decided to purchase a family membership since it made sense due to the general admission price. By doing so, a family will pay for the membership in just two visits. After our first visit, we were glad that we purchased the membership because most of the animals that my kids were interested in seeing weren't available for viewing. However, on our second visit there, we did manage to see almost all of the animals of interest. In addition, we managed to time it just right to take in a bird show. The hilly terrain that you will need to navigate can be quite exhausting especially on a hot day, as our day was awfully hot and humid. All the zoo personnel that we interacted with were very friendly and informative. Its definitely not any close to the San Diego Zoo but a good alternative that's local, convenient, and fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RktDogg
50,Zoo is a good place for families,"Fun, educational zoo with many activities for younger children. Wonderful location in Griffith Park. Some accessability difficulties for those with limited mobility (hills).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sheryll02
40,Terrific place!,"Being an LA resident, I've been here several times. I love walking the grounds, seeing all of the animals, and just relaxing and enjoying the surroundings. Having a picnic with friends was a highlight of my most recent visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelRobs
40,Lions and tigers and bears........oh my!,"I made a recent visit to the Los Angeles Zoo after a long absence (hadn't been there in 10+ years). It is extensive and impressive. We had lunch at Reggie's Bistro, named after an alligator who became a local star after eluding capture for 2 years from a South Bay lake. Reggie was finally captured in 2005 and has lived comfortably at the zoo since then. Reggie's Bistro was a pleasant surprise, the food was fresh, tasty and served in very generous portions. I had the pulled pork salad and made yummy noises through the entire meal. Also quite reasonably priced. I do recommend going to the zoo early when it isn't so hot. We were there during the heat of the afternoon and many of the animals were napping in shaded areas and not easily seen. The giraffes were out and about and showing off their three youngsters and quite spectacular. Also entertaining were monkeys and the beautiful flock of flamingos. The elephant exhibit is really well done and new since I was there last. One final note....bees! They are everywhere and love to annoy you when you are eating, maybe some bug spray would help keep them from buzzing around you. I highly recommend this Los Angeles icon it's a great, inexpensive way to entertain out of town guests and a fun day trip for all you local Angelenos.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/badlinda
40,Long trek on a hot day. . . .,"First visit to park and upon driving up I thought 'what did I just sign my family up for?'. The exterior is a bit dated and the parking lot looks bigger than the zoo but looks were, thankfully, deceiving. The zoo is HUGE! Prepare for a long walk and if you end up going on a scorcher of a day like we did drink plenty of liquids! I wish someone had told us about the tram which apparently has drop off zones throughout the zoo so you can explore and ride to next area. Is the zoo pristine? No. Could it use some updates? Yes. Did we enjoy it? Yes! Exhibits directions are everywhere so you can easily find your favorite animals and skip the ones you might not want to see. There are plenty of animals but again because of the heat the day we went several were in hiding from the heat and who can blame them. We did get to see some of our favorites - lions, elephants, zebras, hippos and the back of a gorilla. The lines at eating establishment were ridiculously long and I refused to stand in them for overpriced burgers. My suggestion is bring your own food or snacks and skip the lines. Our kids love dinosaurs so we paid the extra fee to walk thru exhibit and I'd say - save your money. It was nothing terrific and, IMO, not worth the extra fee charged.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/158melissal
20,It Went Down Hill,"I have been to the LA Zoo about six times. I went around 1986 and then I went this year with my kids. When I was a kid there were a lot of animals. I recall seeing plenty of everything. I recall an awesome aviary and lots of colorful flamingos at the entrance. This year it all looked so sad. I was deeply disappointed. It was not much better than the Sacramento Zoo, which is very small or even the Santa Ana Zoo, which is likewise tiny. The aviary smelled really bad. It also saddened me to see these lonely animals incarcerated. Single animals by themselves pacing back and forth or just lying down depressed. This zoo clearly needs a lot more funding and better management. I would not recommend it to anyone, go to the San Diego Zoo and the San Diego Safari Park . The Safari Park is really the most human zoo I have ever been too, it is somewhat pricey, but it is worth it, if you want animals to be treated right go here. Another thing I liked about the San Diego zoos is the fact that you get to ride, you don't have to walk much to see all the exhibits. The Safari Park, you have to ride because it is so spacious. If you do go to the LA Zoo, buy the tram tickets if you have small children, you will get exhausted at some point in time and will be glad to have tram tickets.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kat2020
40,Leo and Deda first visit,"Spending a day with grand son at Zoo; Priceless. We picked the best time to visit LA Zoo. The day after 4th July in the morning; no crowds, lines and traffic.Many of the animals were not on display. But, still a great place to spend with my two and half grandson. Answering all the questions!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davel19

50,Lovely place,"Lots of exciting and exotic animals, and plants with great informational and educational signs. Place is huge and maps are provided with ticket purchase. There is also push chairs to borrow and even per mobiles for people disabled to walk long distances. Plenty of restrooms and machines providing refreshments for reasonable prices. Parking outside the zoo is free. There is even several of coffee places and play park for the youngest.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/21nenadj
50,Family trip to the Zoo,"A lot of our family was in town so we thought the zoo was something that would appeal to all ages. There is a lot of walking and it's a bit hilly so that was a challenge for the 85 year old great-grandpa. He took the tram. Bird show was nice. The new Rainforest of the America exhibit is great, especially the otters!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hikerbear2
40,"We are zoo people, and this one is nice, but a little small","We love zoos, and visit them all around the world. This one has been here for a while, and does show signs of age. The best part of it is that there are animals from all over the world. The visitor is guided to various ""countries,"" where they can find animals from China, Australia, Africa, Asia, etc. There are some very attractive water features, and good restaurants for lunch. The only negative is that some of the animal enclosures are obviously way too small and are reminiscent of zoos from years gone by (see the rhinoceros venue, for example). Modern zoos give animals lots more room to move around. But we still had a good time here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/96ralphd
30,"Nothing Wrong, Just Average.",There were some very interesting animals but would have loved to learn a little more about some of them but I get the feeling that the zoo is in a state of transition (not renovations just slowly moving into a new erra). Some enclosures that look very natural and spacious and then other seem quite small and 'old fashion'. I found the reptiles very interesting but perhaps because we don't have snakes where we're from. We came as a couple and used the LA GOCARD.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Marcimo_NZ
40,Nice way to spend the day.,Went there with my husband and 12 year old son. I really liked this zoo as it wasn't too big and didn't have all the hills to climb. There was enough there to make it interesting without a huge amount of walking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lisasH8792VB
40,L.A. Zoo!,"We were visiting family in Los Angeles and decided to take our 80 year old grandmother to the Zoo last week. We had our two teenagers with us so it was a fairly diverse group. Normally I'm not a huge fan of zoos but we had a great time. The Zoo is set in a nicely wooded area that kept us in the shade most of the time and the natural terrain of land was kept intact which added a pretty natural feel. The pens are still pens, and the animals are still caged, but it's a zoo and it seemed to me that there was effort put into keeping their habitats as pleasant as possible. I didn't think much one way or the other about the price of admission and we ate lunch in the Zoo and I felt it was reasonable. Parking was easy which was a huge plus. We also rented a motorized scooter for our grandma and that was easy to rent and easy to return. It's a very large Zoo so plan to spend the day and chill.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/195margyb
40,First visit to the LA Zoo,"This was my first visit to the LA Zoo. My daughter and my two grandkids, ages 1 and 3, have an annual pass. She mentioned it was hilly but I did not think it was as hilly as the zoo in Colorado Springs or Oakland. The little ones enjoyed it. I thought it was kind of small but my daughter said we only saw half of it. I look forward to visiting again to see the rest of it. We noticed the animals here were not lethargic and quite active. Food was not outrageously priced. With a season pass you get a discount on most everything, souvenirs and food.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ca1842
10,Los Angeles Zoo,"This was a really disappointing day out. After spending 25 minutes queuing to get in we spent 2 hours wondering around and only saw 3 elephants, an alligator and a couple of rabbits. This is one attraction I wouldn't recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/craigt710
40,Great for young kids,Although it was a bit hot outside the visit was great. My 2 year old loved it. Go early so you don't feel overcrowded. My teens liked it but obviously it was mostly a visit for the little one.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KarlaStegui
40,Great little zoo,I was pleasantly surprised with the LA zoo. It's obviously much smaller than the San Diego zoo but it is well designed and there are a large variety of animals. The staff was very friendly. Great place to take kids of all ages!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BnRadventures2015
40,Relaxing and enjoyable!,"Has a little bit of everything. Enjoyed the day with 2 other adults.Get there extra early because the line is super long prior to opening hours. Be sure to bring a hat (or purchase one at the front entrance) and sunscreen. The elephant demo was super cute and I would do it over again if ever I return. Just a short ride from LAX so if you have the time, do not miss it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nalocty
30,Good for small kids,The zoo is built on a hillside so be prepared to do some light hiking if you don't use the tram. We were members for a long time when the kids were small and enjoyed it very much. Over the last few years there have been some very nice upgrades and improvements it sorely needed. It's a solid zoo. It's not amazing but it's not a bore either. There is plenty here to engage smaller kids including a large playground and a few small rides. The shows are particularly fun and worth the effort. It's reasonably priced as well. It gets pretty busy on the weekends so plan accordingly.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StaceyQM
20,If You've Been to Other Zoos skip this one,"I love zoos - we've moved a lot and the zoo is the first attraction I generally visit. This move was different for a variety of reasons but we finally got there and my reaction is ""why bother?""$20 these days seems to be a bargain price for an attraction especially with free parking - but it does make if difficult for a family to go - especially since once inside everything else is additional even the shuttle. But forget about the cost. As I read some of the reviews I can only imagine they were seeing a zoo for the first time through their child's eyes.The signage is poor at best ... many signs are missing. There are few educational explanations and the facility itself is in bad need of a facelift.Unless you have small visitors and don't mind spending a fair amount of cash skip this one and save up for San Diego or San Francisco - more $$$ but you get something for your money there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FormerChicagoGal
50,Wake those animals up,They renovated this place and is pretty decent.Pack a doggy bag lunch and save some $.If you do eat here they have various restaurants set up throughout the zoo.Elephant exhibit was impressive and they have a dinosaur exhibit that costs extra.Overall good way to spend time with the family and kids love the array of animals,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/phildeez818
30,Big and confusing,"Perhaps because it was SundayIt seems like a disorganized zooIt's niceIn retrospect, I would give it up..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DavidT1978
50,Awesome experience,"Went there on Thursday with a family of 4 and we had a enjoyable time there. The zoo size is perfect for us not too small or big. We could not see the elephants because we went in late. A lots of people said we should start from the end first but I rather go from the entrance up because at the top end of the zoo is a playgrounds for kids so we can sit down and enjoy after finished more half than half of the park. Tips: Traffic to LA always bad so be prepare, after finish the zoo if have time and energy should go to conservatorium in Griffith Park, there is a big playgrounds at Griffith park old zoo if you have young kids should check it out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bilieu
30,"Great zoo, large variety of animals, Easy to get lost","I have a membership to this zoo, and thoroughly enjoy it for an outing with my little one. Each trip we get to see different animals awake or acting differently. I love all of the plants and greenery. The carousel is beautiful and fun for the kids. The safari shuttle is decent, but not needed. Although if you just want to get on the shuttle and do a whole loop so you can figure out the zoo layout better, that's a good idea, but you don't get much information or interaction on it, and you definitely can't see the animals from the shuttle.I would say that it can be outrageously crowded, but I suppose that's a given. During the weeks it is full of school groups, which is awesome to see all of the kids getting an education. At times many of the kids aren't being watched very well by their school leaders and end up crawling all over my baby stroller, etc., but overall it's ok.The food is decent, and has a variety throughout the park. There are park benches everywhere, which is useful, and also plenty of bathrooms. Parking is easy. I would like to see more information on their website about where the animals have come from, and how the zoo helps them. Because at times it's very sad to see them in there seemingly small surroundings looking bored and lonely :/.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/drmstr
30,Nice zoo,Nice zoo could do with better sign posts for directions to exhibits to be clearer. Also needs better selection of food outlets. But overall a nice zoo with a fairly good selection of animals.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/geoffj2015
50,The LA Zoo Was Fabulous,"If you like zoos, I highly recommend the LA Zoo. Lots of exhibits. Good for at least a half day and easily for a full day. Animals were clean and well cared for. We saw lots of animals that we had never seen before. Would go again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SteveKINNS
40,Nice place to visit,I love zoos and was glad I had a chance to visit this one. I love the atmosphere within the zoo. There were tons of trees throughout. I like the way each area was sort of sectioned off to itself. The zoo could be very crowded and you would never know. One of the more interesting displays was of the gorillas. They were very playful and noisy. it was a nice day. Not very hot but there are services throughout the zoo. My biggest negative is that once you get deep off into the zoo it's hard to find your way around we had a difficult time finding the exit.Better signage throughout would be very helpful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/enyjim
50,Great day at the LA Zoo and Botanical Gardens,"The walk around the Zoo and Botanical Gardens was relaxing, educational and exciting, all together!! I thoroughly enjoyed seeing the variety of animals and their settings. The gorillas were amazing! They are brilliant - you could see them thinking. The lions were beautiful. The elephants were huge and spectacular to see up close.There is so much to see. This is great for children, teens, adults and seniors. It was a great day!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/debraw679

30,Don't go before closing time.,"It's a very big zoo. We paid $20/person. The zoo closed at 5. We arrived at 3:30 and were warned they would be putting away the large animals, however after walking for some time it seemed the majority of animals were already gone. Needless to say, a less than exciting trip. Also, I didn't see the botanical garden anywhere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashleyr667
50,Great zoo for the price,The zoo is about 20 minutes for Hollywood boulevard via taxi. It opens from 10am to 5pm. $20 for an adult which is a great price for the size of the zoo and the variety of animals they have there.Be prepared to walk and some of it is up hill but if you plan your day you can see all the animals and go to the zoo keeper talks. They have many places to eat or if you take a packed lunch there is plenty of places to sit. We went on a Saturday and it was packed but you still got to see the animals but If you are going to eat there make sure you don't do it between 12 and 2 o'clock as you will be lining up for a long time. Well worth the $20. Zoo's in Australia cost much more than that for smaller zoo's,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/961amandaw
40,We had a good time,"The place is quite big, it takes some hours to walk it all. When me and my girlfriend were there, they had some animals out of the cages and we couldn't see them, others than that it is a nice place to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peterpetrovkn

40,Great Zoo,"This zoo is in a lovely setting (I guess that's the botanical garden part) and the animals look clean, healthy, and well cared for. My 4-year-old loved everything about it, especially the flamingos. I can't wait to take the rest of my kids back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ellieandjeffw
30,Good Local Photographic Practice and a note about parking,"It's been a very, very long time since I've been at this zoo, but I had just bought a new camera lens and wanted to get some practice. It was a cloudy over cast day which was perfect for taking pictures. My only wish would have been that more of the animals weren’t behind any obstructions like plastic barriers, roped or metal enclosures for more photographic opportunities. I appreciate that the zoo is here at an affordable price especially for families with kids. I just wish that the settings were more naturalistic and I was slightly disappointed that the koalas were NOT on display! In fact, many of the enclosures had the sign, "" 'Temporarily off Display.' "" Would I be back? Probably, but just for photo practice. As for parking, there is a ""free"" area and a preferred parking area for $6. My husband and I got there at 10:30-ish and we were able to still find free parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pandamonium1362
40,Educational and FUN!,"On my visit to the LA Zoo I learned the difference between monkeys and apes, I saw several adorable babies, and I had a great walk through different gardens. The whole zoo is very manageable on foot, although they do have a tram also. It took me about 5 hours to cover most of the exhibits. There are lots of food options and plenty of restrooms. I would recommend this Zoo to anyone interested in seeing and learning about a variety of animals for all around the world.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ninag465
50,World-Class Zoo,"I've been a member of this zoo for years. I don't go as often as I'd like, but every time I do go, I'm very impressed with the variety of species, the beauty of the habitats, and the special programs offered by the zoo. They have made many improvements in the last several years. I have also taken my grandson to special children's classes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/132suzannee
30,"OK, but nothing special","Went here with my wife, because we both like looking a animal. The first impression I have is that it was a dissapointment. In general it was OK, but lots of the exhibits were closed and the ones that were open often seemed to be empty. I was looking forward to looking at the elephants, but they only had one on display. After a while I got a better feeling and it was fun, but I don't think I will be coming back. I would have wished for some kind of interactive stuff, like feeding some of the animals. The whole park seemed to be in slightly bad shape.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BobReh
50,Now That's An Urban Zoo!,"What a great zoo. A delightful urban oasis in the heart of Los Angeles. The LA Zoo continues to refresh and enhance itself. We enjoyed the nooks and crannies, subplots within each section. What a great day. Every animal was out and about waiting to be seen! Keep up the good work LA Zoo.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JAR411
50,Beautiful experience,"We visited the zoo with our granddaughter. Parking was super easy and a sorority wak to the entrance. Huge lineup for tickets but didn't really take a long time. The gorillas were the most fun. Also nice viewing area for Thailand Elephants and for the giraffe. We had lunch at the Mahale Cafe. The pizza slices and fries. Pizza was ok and pricy. Fries to die for !!. If you are thinking memebership, search the net for 20% off coupons. Easy to walk around or jump on the shuttle. Will be going back",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Moyez2015
20,Needs some work,The zoo itself was dirty and run down. The lines were long. A lot of places to eat weren't open making the ones that were really crowded. It's a hilly location so there's a lot of up and down walking. My teenage boys like zoos so we've visited a lot of them over the years and this one ranks pretty low on our list of zoos visited.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deltaduck2
30,Lovely Animals but a lot of work going on,Positives: Majority of animals looked happy and were not showing signs of stress.Negatives: Some of the enclosures were on the small side and there were a lot of enclosures closed for construction - you would have thought that these would have been done over the winter so they were ready for easter. Lack of places to purchase soft drinks.Daughter is studying animal management so as well as visiting to look at animals we were also looking at their enclosures.On the whole the animals looked well cared for and the majority showed no signs of stress but generally the enclosures were on the small side but enrichment was given to compensate.There were a lot of enclosures shut for refurbishment which was a shame as the zoo was so busy as it was the easter holidays.As the weather is so hot it was disappointing that there were very few outlets to buy drinks and those that were available were not coping very well with the demand and as shade was hard to find it made queuing for drinks very uncomfortable.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ruftytuftyrider1966
30,A Zoo's Zoo,"This was an authentic old school zoo environment. The grounds were clean and all the animals were. My problem stemmed more with the long lines for food and drink and the distance between refreshment locations. At one point our entire party of 2 families with littles was parched and not a drink in site.We did however like the exhibits especially the monkeys who put on a grand show, the otters playing around and the kiddie zoo.Overall we had a good time and he kids enjoyed themselves. The parents did too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelMom2Too
40,Fun times with kids,"Not much expectations but definitely surprised with this zoo. Big landscape, good exhibits...Lion, Tigers, Kangaroos, Elephants you name it...You can even din next to Giraffes :) Specifically it does stink like other zoos where i have been to specially in the bay area like Oakland zoo.Recommended!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iq1012
40,4 th time to this zoo in past 25 years,"Took our 10 year old to the zoo, was clean and lots of animals to see he loved it. I recommend this zoo. Don't get the cheese steak sandwich at the Gorilla grill, it was nasty.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barbaraPasoRobles_CA
30,Fun Day but the Zoo Could be Better,"My wife and I took our 6 month old for her first zoo visit today. Besides being way warmer than expected, we enjoyed our time at the zoo. I only give it 3 stars because I feel the experience is not as good as zoos in other major cities and could be improved upon. Major complaints - long food lines, minimal amount of animals (1 gorilla, 1 alligator, etc.), ""free"" parking that is full so you have to pay for preferred parking, and very few shows. Who doesn't love going to a show to learn about animals??? Again, we had a fun time but will probably check out San Diego before giving in another try.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pkashinsky
40,Great way to spend a day,"I had annual family membership for years since I live close by and would visit couple times a month if I particularly didn't have anything else to do. Zoo is pretty spread out with new exhibits that was built in last couple years (reptile, amazon). There are a lot of trees and places to sit along the way so it's not too bad whenever we visited. Some of the older cages do feel bit small for animals. I like different food they offer. And it's got free parking. To fully see every exhibit and animals will actually take entire day if you're up for it. There is a playground that my kids love and is our usual lunch spot. And Carousel as you enter.Just beware of any school holidays. Every school holidays cars line up from freeway just to find a parking...which is weird since normal weekend doesn't get that packed and easily find a parking spot. I guess day off school everyone wants to do something. Your option would be to go around to Zoo Dr and park on a lot across the street from main lot or park near the soccer field and walk to the zoo.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BigBoyA77
30,Nice Zoo - needs to be refurbished,"Pros:Small enough to walk the entire zoo & see most animals in 3-5 hours.The paths were kept up nicely.. concreteGreat exerciseHot dogs are good - all beef & grilled.. not boiledBottled water - 33oz size not too horrible for $4.50Parking - Free or $8 for VIP ParkingMost animals appeared fairly healthyExpensive: $20pp but we but an annual pass for two people for $79 (2 visits total for a break even)Environment: beautiful foilage, plenty of shady spots with benches and gorgeous bamboo all over!Bathrooms: some were clean some were filthy.Safety: I felt safe all throughout the Zoo and the parking area.Cons: It was Easter and there was no available parking so we had to pay $8 for VIP.exhibits: many were completely void of any animals.Hours: too short. Only open 10-5Animals: Huge eagles in tiny aviary cage was sad.Most of the animals were contained in areas that seemed to be way too small.The whole Zoo needs to be refurbished, bigger and updated.Bathrooms: some clean some filthy.. enter at your own risk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/la123brat
40,Family Activity,The LA Zoo is a great place to take your family for an outing. Make sure you bring a hat to the zoo as there is not much shade throughout the park.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PierreTheFoodie
30,Not Overwhelmed,"The L.A. Zoo appears to cover a great deal of landscape, but, we were somewhat disappointed with the number of animals contained therein. As well, and as I guess to be expected, a number of the animals were out of their pens for maintenance/health purposes. Lines are long to get in (this was a Saturday) and it is not an inexpensive proposition ($20 tickets with modest reductions for children and seniors). I am not sure that I would go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/irawine
40,"Average Zoo, Beautiful Grounds","I went on a crowded and warm Saturday. I felt like I had to dodge all of the many strollers and large families, and I had to wait at many exhibits for large groups to move for me to get a closer look.The zoo does have a variety of animals and environments. Some of the enclosures could use to be updated and it felt like more than a few animals were not visible or removed from their enclosures.I was very impressed by the gardens and landscaping. The blossoming trees and bushes were beautiful, worth the trek up hills and through the zoo.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jcast27
40,Great Zoo for a Family Outing,"This is a smaller zoo, but that means you can see it all in a few hours. It's nothing compared to the San Diego Zoo, but for us locals it is a nice outing. My kids love it there and the new additions they are putting in are fantastic. We have a Membership and it was less than $100 for the whole family for the year. A great value.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adam8881
50,Everything in the zoo looks great!,"We have been going to this zoo for 25 years. The kids are grown, so we don't go often now, this was the first time in years my daughter and I enjoyed it.There were many trees and shrubs in bloom, so springtime is an excellent time to visit. Another bonus in spring: baby animals!Enrichment for the animals is really impressive at the LA Zoo. We saw Tazmanian Devils who'd just received some beef knuckle bones, and they were gleefully running around their enclosure with them. The monkeys were getting papaya treats, and they too were very excited. By afternoon, I expect all that activity will make them quite sleepy, another good reason to come in the morning.The enclosures are very natural looking, lots of trees, stumps, grasses and places for the animals to hide, so looking for them was a lot of fun.The enclosures are very well marked, with interesting descriptions that are far more detailed than the ""big zoo to the south."" Speaking of comparison to SD Zoo, in addition to LA having much better and more educational signage, gate entrance fees to the ""other"" one is $50.00 per person, as opposed to $20.00 for LA. And we don't have a freeway running next to ours, it's peaceful, verdant and beautiful. I know where I prefer to be!Here are my two top tips for enjoying the LA Zoo to it's fullest:Get there when the zoo opens. This is especially important in summer months, as it can get hot there. The zoo is well shaded, but there are a good number of hills.Do not eat at the dining pavilions! I know, this sounds odd, but in summer, there are a lot of bees around the food, looking for sweets. It's near impossible to drink a soda, for example, without a bee entering the can! There is no way the zoo is going to use chemical sprays to get rid of bees, it's not what you do in a zoo/botanical garden, so if you avoid sitting in those seating areas, you won't complain about bees. It is outdoors, so expect insects.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/plumeriad2017
40,Zoofun,Very nice zoo.$20 Priced reasonable and enclosures interesting for animals as well as visitors. Picture taking opportunities,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stephanielN5649EF
30,Quiet day,"If you are looking for a quiet attraction without a lot of traffic, this is the zoo.Nothing to compare to the San Diego Zoo, which I'm sure most people know. Not a whole lot of animals, a lot of exhibits were closed.My 4 year old wasn't impressed seeing as we recently visited the San Diego Zoo.A lot of walking for very few sites.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mmouawia
50,A fantastic zoo!,"This is one of the best and biggest zoos that I've ever been to. They have such wide variety of animals that practically you could name an animal that you've seen at a zoo before and most likely the Los Angeles Zoo will have it. I went here in the summer of 2010 when three major areas of the zoo were closed for construction: The LAIR (indoor reptile area), the elephant exhibit, and the the Rain Forest of the Americas. Despite this, I still saw more than enough animals. I was there for hours and couldn't even finish seeing everything. Some of the highlights of the zoo for me were the seals and sea lion exhibit exhibit because of the large underwater viewing, the gorilla exhibit because they have two troops in multiple viewing areas, the chimpanzees because they were performing tricks because they used to be in the circus, the koalas because you don't see these too often in zoos in America, the aviary because it feels like you're walking up the side of a mountain in a jungle, and the meerkats because you can see what them through the underground burrows. I highly recommend the LA Zoo to both locals and visitors, and if you're a zoo/animal lover this zoo is a must!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaeltravelg
30,"Spread out, not enough animals","We came in the middle of a searing heat wave (or so it seemed), and we fairly melted in the 90 degree heat as we hiked all over the zoo. Was this hike rewarded with sights of cool animals? Not really. Did we see some really really fat goats? Yes.I would skip this for another attraction in the future. This isn't even 25% of the San Diego Zoo in animals, but about the same size in terms of hiking around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Former_grad_student
40,A nice zoo and a good way to spend the day,"The zoo is pretty extensive and took us 4-5 hours to walk around. If you're looking for a quiet day to take a walk and have some fun, this is a great way to do it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ADS80
30,Overall nice zoo,This zoo had a lot of animals to observe and a lot of territory to cover so it took the whole day to take it all in. The enclosures though really need to be improved. A lot of them were barren ground because they were to small for the animal they housed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/739dennist
50,Fun Zoo,"We had a great time at the LA Zoo!! Our boys loved the snow leopards, The giraffes were interacting with the public it was awesome to see. Another nice experience was to see the new baby Koala hanging from his mama. All the animals were active. We also got to see the crocodiles close up and personal. I would recommend the LA Zoo to everyone. There is hills all over the zoo but they also have a Tram for $1.00 each way in case the walk is too much. It was a Saturday so the lines to get in were long, we have an annual pass so we got to go right in. If you are planning to go on a weekend go early or buy your tickets online, if not plan to go early because there was a line to buy tickets and then another line to get in. Summer months the animals are not very active either. Right now is a perfect time to go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D1318SOcaroll
30,Good place to take the kids,It is great to expose you kids to nature so that they will want to protect it when they are older. But I am older and I wish that many of these animals were in better/ bigger enclosures. The lions look like they live in a concrete box slightly larger than my apartment. I hope that in the future more enclosures are improved!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Brian0Tindall
50,Getting Better Every Visit,"The LA Zoo continues to improve every time we visit. The new Amazon themed area is well done, specifically the Giant River Otter habitat. The family of otters has an amazing exhibit & were romping & playing crazily. It would have been worth the price of admission just to see that single exhibit. The new elephant & reptile areas are also enjoyable for animals & visitors. There are definitely some older areas that need to be replaced but with the standards they've set with their newer exhibits I'm sure that will come when the budget permits. If this zoo was somewhere else I'm sure it would have a much better reputation, but being near Hollywood with a disproportionate amount of people with the money, time, & public recognition to spread misinformation & half-truths about the place. Don't believe it, the LA Zoo is worth your time to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheSpeis
50,"A great day trip, or a wonderful brief visit","I am an annual pass holder to the LA Zoo. It is a fairly large zoo, that you can take a good 4-6 hours to visit if you want to see everything. Usually I'll take my 3 and 6 year old there for about 2 hours. We'll look at animals for a while and let them play on the playground.I've enjoyed the orangutan enclosure, chimpanzee and the giraffe exhibit. My kids generally like the petting zoo and the ""scary"" reptile building. It isn't scary...For those considering an annual pass, they have holiday specific events at Christmas and Halloween. These are a lot of fun.I've found this to be a worthwhile visit for out of towners, but is a great value for residents if you get the annual pass.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NormalOrlandoGuy
40,Loved it!!!!,"Loved the zoo. It was fairly big and my husband and I spent a whole day there. There was a huge assortment of animals, and food and drinks were readily available. I would have like to have seen better habitats for some of the animals though. Overall, we had a good visit and would recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adab790
40,Superbowl Sunday at the Zoo,"Since we figured that the Superbowl wouldn't be that special (and from what we heard it wasn't), We decided to skip all the sitting around with nachos and beer and go to the L.A. Zoo. It was a great choice! Overall there was only one exhibit that we had to wait to get up close. Everything else was wide open. The only things we did not see because they were not out at the times we went by were the Elephants, Rhinos, the bear and the Jaguar at the Rain forest exhibit. Everything was good to go. The weather was beautiful and the park was clean and did not smell at all. We got there when it opened and purchased tickets in advance so we did not have to wait in the ticket line (the way to go). I didn't get many pictures at all since I forgot my camera but that was ok. This is a great place to bring children. They also have a few spots to learn some education on different animals. Easy access and free parking if you show up early.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jedimasterkush
30,More communication needed! More customer awareness!,"Outstandingly inadequate signage. It took us forever to find anything and then, usually, only by accident as there was not enough informational signs telling us specifically which walkway to take. Literally - every person we passed was having the same problem as they roamed around frustrated,grumbling about trying to follow the few generic signs that would point in a general direction and then have no encouraging follow up. This is a serious problem at this zoo. Visitors exhaust themselves trying to find the animals they have come to see. That said - they have one of the most beautiful male lions I've ever seen. His mate was magnificent as well. Some of the animals were delightfully 'close' in feel like the zebras and giraffes. We viewed a lot of lethargy and seeming boredom - signs that explain more about the animals various behaviors at time of day would have make more sense. One orangatang (sp) rolled everywhere he went, leaving us wondering if he was disabled. Again - an explanation would have been helpful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JesseLosAngeles
50,Worth being a yearly member,"This is the second year our family has decided to have a yearly pass. We enjoy walking around the zoo and go at least once a month. We live very close by. The zoo has a little something for everyone, beer, wine and soda to walk around with. This is a nice place to have lunch and you can buy food at three different locations in the park. Bring your lunch you can eat when you first walk in or go to the play ground. My granddaughter 1 and my youngest 22 both love the zoo. The animals are well taken care of and the staff is very friendly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CSS9112014
50,I'm not lion when I say it's a great visit...,"Los Angeles isn't the kind of place you think of having wild animals, or at least THOSE kind of wild animals...but we were pleasantly surprised. A July visit probably wasn't the best option as most of the Animals were trying to beat the heat. But watching the animal care specialists bring out the summer treats for the Lions and hippo was hilarious! The Lions got steak popsicles and the hippos ice cold whole watermelons! I don't know if hippos can smile, but I think I may have seen a grin. Be prepared for a walk and don't be afraid to ask questions! Everyone there is friendly and helpful!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K5589QWjamesd
40,Mostly a great experience,"The Los Angeles Zoo has upgraded many of their exhibits, but there are still a few that need work. Tigers, Chimps, Hippos, Gorillas, Zebras, Bighorn sheep and reptiles are examples of great unobstructed viewing. Many smaller animals are in enclosures that are often dark or behind so much fencing, it's difficult to see the animals. Some animals are virtually never visible such as wild dogs, many of the rain forest exhibits, and bat eared fox. The children's zoo area has many empty exhibits, but the farm animals is great. The bird show is excellent, but not done everyday. Like most tourist venues, food is expensive, but bringing your own picnic is allowed. Be prepared for lots of hills, but most everything is handicap friendly. I visit about twice a month, primarily for photography. A year pass is the best deal if you live in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaele55
20,Very sad zoo,"Do not waste your time in this zoo.THe animals looked sad and depressed.i was amazed with the ""condor of the Andes""! such a big and beautiful bird but the cage was tinny.I used to go to the zoos everyplace I go, and let me tell you that this is one of the worst zoos I ever been. It looks like the zoo does not have budget to keep it nice and with appropriate environments for the animals. But if you decide to go, keep in mind that the zoo is huge and probably you will spend 5 hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/460alejandra
50,Great Family Fun,"f you're a first-time visitors to Los Angeles that are on a budget (I would't necessarily sign this under the wing since there are many sites that you can visit for free and have a blast). However, I will recommend this for families who live near or around Los Angeles, or those who don't want to go to Disneyland (then you should consider getting membership here since you can also get discounted tickets to other parks and zoos throughout America - check la zoo reciprocal membership list - and it benefits the animals too).When you get the family membership, you can bring a guest and your kids to the zoo for as many times as you'd like, and they have different exhibits and special activities each month. This makes the membership so much more valuable, and such a great resource when you are thinking about activities for your little one.I think you'll enjoy checking out the new Tasmanian Devil that they added opposite of the koala and kangaroos. If you're a reptile fan, you see a lot of those in the reptile section, ranging from turtles to geckos to snakes. They have a demonstration in the Elephant section almost daily and you also get to see a close up of the orangutans - which was awesome for our little ones. You also get close encounters with different animals in show and tell located near the petting zoo. While the bear, tiger, and snow leopard are pretty laid back, you get a sneak peek here and there, but don't get your hopes up. The giraffes recently had a baby, so you might enjoy the little critter as well.Overall, it's a great place and a great organization, I would recommend it any time of the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nanita53
50,LA Zoolights 2015 awesome !,"Wonderful lights and experience at a very reasonable price if you find an online deal on i believe it was Living Social, but also check with Groupon. Free parking, but even if you pay in advance you have to wait in a long line to exchange your Living Social prepay voucher for an actual ticket, which seemed odd, and no separate line from those that didn't purchase in advance. The event itself was wonderful some amazing and wonderful use of light with much great digital work and what looked like laser lights. There was also a wonderful light show display using water fountains. Highly recommend attending at the holidays in 2016.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/northernk
40,If you like Chimps this is the place for you!,"I went to California in search of having an up close experience with a chimpanzee. After finding Working Wildlife and finding out they wanted $900 and the chimp was 5 years old and getting to the age where he would not be good around people I passed up that with a visit to the L.A. Zoo instead. Hearing that they had the largest group on chimps in the country I was excited to visit. We went on a Sunday and it wasn't too crowded. We went right to the chimp area and there were chimps. Everywhere. from old ones (43 years old) to babies (4 months old). I stayed for a good hour just taking pictures of these amazing creatures. I realized the babies are adorable but the older ones are just plain mean. I made the right decision not to interact with a 5 year old. The rest of the zoo had very interesting exhibits. The giraffe were great to see up close. A great place to take the kids. I had a wonderful time. They had a fun gift shop also. The entrance fee was reasonable,,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NJJA1969
50,A Perfect Place to see Animals of all kinds,"The LA Zoo has a wide variety of Animals from all over the world. From Seals, Flaminhos, African Elephants to the South American Condor. The Zoo was remodeled a few years back so it looks real nice. It is big enough to walk around with tennis but, not like San Diego Zoo where you need to take a bus to get around... It is stroller friendly too. The food was fresh, good and not over priced. They also serve beer and wine for anyone over 21 :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alejandrae447
30,LA Zoo,"The first impression of the LA Zoo, when you walk in, is that it has been around for a while. This Zoo is very large and you do a lot of walking. We went on a day when there were no shows, so all we could do was walk around and look at the animals. The day started off sunny but then got chilly so the animals all went to their warm spot in their cages. For me the best part of the Zoo was the giraffes, lions and sea otters. I wish I could give it a higher rating, but my kids were even saying the San Diego Zoo would have been better, but it was further ways.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HKoreenRS37
40,Lions and Tigers and Bears...oh my!,"The Los Angeles Zoo & Botanical Gardens is a massive complex and the sprawling layout requires a lot of flat and incline walking, heading from exhibit to exhibit. Most of the animals are in opened enclosures that allow you to feel like the animals are within arm's length. They have a great variety of animals and attractions. But, the best is when something WILD happens. Like when a lion was roaring. We were no where near the exhibit, but it was so loud and scary, we had to make sure the king of the jungle wasn't roaming the zoo. Once we were assured we were safe we hurried to see what the commotion was about. It was lunch time! Once we sat and watched the chimps for hours. It was mating season and the guys were fighting and screaming and making weapons, while the girls were trying to comfort or run away. You just have to be at the right place at the right time. Because there are times when everyone is simply asleep or grooming - and looking at you as if they can't wait for closing time.They allow outside food here, so make sure to pack lots of snacks and liquids since the food/drinks here are expensive.Overall, the zoo does a nice job of creating unique and interesting exhibits, and has a zoo lights program during the darker holiday season.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jetset3008
40,Lots of animals,Well laid out but the signing could be more accurate. Little information about the various plants so disappointing as a Botanical Garden. A highlight was watching the Hippopotamuses being fed. A good selection of creatures to see but where were the elephants? A huge enclosure for them but these shy and retiring beasts must have been hiding under a leaf!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Otteraswas
30,A lot of walking. Don't go on a hot day.,"The L.A. zoo is not great (go to Santa Barbara zoo if you can). It's really spread out & a lot of walking. I recommend buying a ticket for the tram. The food is not great, but food is available. The kids like the play area. Animal exhibits aren't spectacular, but some have been updated. In Dec., buy tickets in advance for the Zoo Lights or you'll never get in. Kids love the zoo, so I've been there a million times. However, now that my kids are older, I probably won't go back. Tip: While in Griffith Park, see the Autry Museum (across the street) or go to Travel Town (it's free).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/332marleneh

50,Holiday lights ablaze and amaze!,"My perception of Los Angeles just keeps getting better and better with every special place I find and the LA Zoo and Botanical Gardens didn't let me down. After a day cooped up in the house, I wanted to stretch the legs and take in a holiday attraction or gathering. Thinking that the smaller display with the train ride near the freeway was the extent of the holiday lights in the park, I had a hard time convincing my boyfriend to drive further into Griffith Park to see if there was more. I was glad I convinced him to further down the dark and winding road that lead to the zoo. It was a perfectly chilly December night and when we arrived we had about 2.5 hours to tour the grounds before the zoo closed. This was just the right amount of time needed to see the wonderful, whimsical, and beautiful displays throughout the zoo. The entrance to the zoo is impressive in itself but once beyond the gate, the eyes are filled with beautiful displays.My favorites included the weeping willow and illuminated live roses, the mirrored balls and lights high in the trees, the elephant display with really cool digital imagery, and the tunnel of holiday lights. I also enjoyed the musical tracks that accompanied one of the displays. The DJ did a great job integrating holiday tunes and cool beats to the rhythm of and feel of the display. There wasn't a display that disappointed.At the end of our visit, we looked at the reindeer and listened to the attendant answer questions about the seasonal guests. She was very knowledgeable and happy to answer any question, We talked with her about other attractions we should see in LA for the holidays and we appreciated the tips she had about holidays in town.This is an excellent attraction for couples and friends as well as families and those with children. Thank you, LA Zoo and Botanical Gardens, for a great holiday treat!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Joe_Cool68510
50,Holy Cow this place is amazing!!,"This is definitely an all day - maybe 2 day event. There is so much to do and see. Plan to start early, take breaks, and see as much as you can. It is well worth the entrance fee and high priced food.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/62440KatieT

It's the animals that always need more space and more thought.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mermaidsylvia
50,A L.A. Must,"The L.A. Zoo is a great place. We went right when they opened. Even though there is free parking, It was worth the $8 to park at the front gate.There are many off shoots from the main path. So, get a map and take your time. The zoo is mostly shaded, which is nice on a hot day. There are plenty of restrooms and places to get drinks.The zoo has what you want, elephants, monkeys, lions, tigers and bears. It is well worth taking the family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/korndogizard
40,A nice escape from the LA craziness.,"When you walk through the gates at the LA Zoo you leave behind the craziness that is LA and step into a quiet, peaceful jungle of wide walking trails and lush vegetation. The exhibits are spread out which allows for a lot of people to be at the zoo at the same time. I can't say we saw anything different at this zoo than at any other we've been to, but it was a nice way to spend a couple hours. Be prepared to hike up some pretty steep hills but there are plenty of resting places and some pretty nice restaurants too. The rainforest was interesting but needs a few more years to mature. The monkeys there were highly entertaining. :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/280markc
30,A nice afternoon.,"We went for a visit yesterday afternoon, just a way to kill time before seeing the lights at 6pm. Zoo was quiet but the animals seemed happy. Lights were lovely in the evening.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Q2607SMjuliah
40,Zoo Lights ~ OK,"Zoo Lights was just OK. NOT spectacular. NOT $20.00 of Christmas lights. I'm glad we experienced this as a family, I doubt we will incorporate this as a part of our tradition. I believe that they could do more. It was advertised as spectacular, and it fell far short. Not impressed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JAR411
40,Zoo lights is another of my new Christmas traditions,"The LA Zoo took over the job of providing a Christmas lights display after the LA Dept. of Power & Water decided to become cheap and stop doing the free drive-through display.They do a really nice job on this, there's only so much to see, so an hour 1/2 is about the right time.I got a living social deal and paid $10 a ticket, one of the things that is a little annoying is having to get in line to redeem the vouchers for actual tickets before you enter, I think they should find a way of being able to accept the vouchers at the door.They have kiosks with hot chocolate, kettle corn, candied almonds, churros and further in one for cocktails/ beer and wine which is fun.Overall a fun way to spend a couple of hours around the holidays with your family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ReenyL
40,Our Saturday Morning Walk at the Zoo,"If you have not been to the Los Angeles Zoo for awhile, you are missing out on something. My bride and I go for our walk on Saturday, at the zoo opening time, and not in the neighborhood. When the zoo first opens up, head to the back of the zoo. the animals in the back are being fed, and are walking around. The other visitors are looking at the animals near the front, so the back is not crowded. Go see the elephants, the rhino, the group of giraffes, and the apes. Our first stop this Saturday will be the toucan. Enjoy the hilly terrain, good exercise, and the animals.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TellTruth2016
40,"Excellent activity for the family, but not a great zoo","I am a member of this zoo, and went on a nice walk there a few weeks ago. A lot of the animals were not visible, but I spent time watching the giraffes and the lion was up and around and roaring. I think I enjoyed looking at the happy children than the unhappy animals.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MelWacks
50,its been at least 10 years... why did i wait so long to go back!,My wife and I decided to take our 2.5 year old daughter for a day at the zoo and where so happy with our day. It seems that the zoo has been continually made an effort to keep the exhibits both enthralling for the visitor and very livable for the animals. I really enjoyed the south American rain forest exhibit with the playful otters and the strange taipers. i also enjoy the orangutans spending a few minutes with some very freindly staff who gave us some insider scoop on the ages and history of the orangs. my daughter love the mere cats so much! cant wait to go back!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jasonphoto
30,Good Value for money.,"My partner and I visited LA Zoo a few weeks ago and we found it really good value for money.It is well looked after and the animals seemed happy enough except for one elephant (I only saw one!) which was rocking back and forth repeatedly - which I know is a sign of extreme boredom and lack of enrichment so I felt a bit off after seeing that - when I went back to see if any more elephants had appeared (about an hour later) the same elephant was doing the same movements.I felt really sorry for him, but unfortunatley Elephants probably are one of the hardest to keep in a zoo. He had a nice big enclosure etc but I just didn't like seeing him do the rocking.Anyway, the zoo itself had so much to see and do. The gardens were in bloom which looked wonderful and the park was so clean and tidy.They would benefit from perhaps another place to sit and eat as I think I only saw 2 and they were so busy!Other than that, I think the zoo is really good value for money but the elephants could do with a bit more to do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HMJLB19
40,A zoo working hard to improve,"Having first-hand experience with the challenges and necessity of a good zoo environment, I saw some positive signs at the LA Zoo. The elephant exhibit is among the better we have seen -- and these large animals are among the most difficult and costly to keep. The Orangutan exhibit was good, and several of the older exhibits had been remodeled to some extent to give the animals more room. The Rainforest exhibit worked hard to convey a message about the relationship between plants and animals.The grounds, too -- once you get past the entrance and into the zoo proper -- are pleasant and were clean and well kept for a public institution.Sadly, though, there are still many small,older exhibits so more capital investment is clearly needed. We wished that, in getting to the animals, we hadn't run such a long gauntlet of fast food stands. And the signage is terrible: even one of the docents could't figure how to direct us back to one exhibit we were especially seeking.Our advice: go with reasonable expectations. Enjoy the animals there,including many rare species from Southeast Asia, China, and the ""..Stan"" countries that are rarely seen anywhere else. And if you love animals and support conservation work, help this institution to succeed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Botticelli1105
30,Nice,"It was lovely to see the zoo, mostly for kids, wouldn't recommend a group of adults, it's a big area you will need to wear a sports shoe, and carry a map with you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hk66alkhalifa
50,lived in the LA area for five years,This is a really nice place to go with any members of the family or just by yourself. The gardens are always in bloom and look fantastic. The zoo is quite large and is full of regular and not so regular types of animals. It is worth the visit and will take most of a full afternoon to go thru and see it all. very nice and clean and well laid out. you can get there by car or public transportation. Small food is available.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barryn680
30,LA Zoo lights - a good visit,"A fun holiday walk through lights to get into the spirit but it is a limited area lit up. And no animals are out. Limited good kiosks. All of that being said we would definitely go again - it is affordable, easy, fun. Perfect for families with small kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EMDionne
30,LA Zoo Lights,"What would you do if you were a zoo animal on a cold night? Probably sleep in your indoor area, right? Well's that exactly what happened when my wife and I went to the LA Zoo's ""Zoo Lights"" exhibition last night. We hardly saw any animals (except some sad looking ""reindeer""). In fact the only wildlife we saw were those animals in the indoor reptile house.The Elephant, big cat, giraffe, rainforest areas, etc are all closed at night. The light displays were cool to see but not worth the trip (especially for 2 adults with no children).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mikerog10
10,Terrible zoo with poorly cared for animals,"This ""zoo"" is a large collection of fast-food stalls and shops selling poorly made Chinese souvenirs. Walk around it enough and you will occasionally come across a miserable looking animal in a decrepit enclosure. On our visit, one of the Asian elephants did nothing but rock back and forth - a sure sign of sensory deprivation and neglect. Another enclosure had an animal in obvious distress, but you couldn't find a keeper anywhere to report the problem. We finally had to call the main switchboard to get someone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelc670
40,Good & Improving Constantly ...,"The LA Zoo is a work in progress and the only way to go is upward constant improvement & there are signs of that going on. Has some spectacular exhibitions such as the Asian / Thai Elephant pavilion & some mediocre ones like the Herpetology exhibits & some cute ones like the children's petting zoo area. Take a child with you & they'll love it. Continuing to improve. TIP: visit the Autrey Western Museum first, across the parking lot, then visit the Zoo. Enjoy. ...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dblmed
20,Unless you go with children under 5 this will be a disappointment!,A child under five is easily pleased and will be delighted by the monkey exhibit. No wonder this zoo is ranked well below the average of US zoos. The focus seems to be on selling merchandise and food.A number of the exhibits were under construction so maybe there is hope for improvement.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Unbongout
40,"The Good, The Bad and The Ugly of the L.A. ZOO","My first visit was many years ago. Not only was I unimpressed, I thought it was downright pitiful. So it took me a long time to give it a second chance.I was so impressed with the evolution that I got a ""Family Membership"" and have had one continuously for over 10 years.The GOOD:The layout is very nice. It seems bigger than it is. They really used the space well. I would like to see the animals grouped by types, as I especially enjoy the Big Cats and Birds of Prey, but the grouping by Geographical Region makes sense, educationally. (Too bad there is yet to be a ""California"" or ""Local"" Section because a Mountain Lion and Red Tail Hawk would be cool)The Bird Atrium, the Bird Show, Petting Zoo, Rain Forest, Reptiles (LAIR)... all of the special exhibits are worth seeing. As are the various Holiday Events.No surprise that snacks can be expensive but the fresh Roasted Almonds and fresh Kettle Corn are what we splurge on. The other stuff is more ordinary and guests are allowed to bring food in.Into History? Not usually associated with a zoo experience, but I'm a bit fascinated by the Cyads that are growing not too far from the entrance. Appropriately growing next to metal dinosaur sculptures. As these plants are living fossils and existed in the age of the dinosaurs. I just find that cool and I always stop to look at them. - I've included pics of them, but oddly TripAdvisor puts original pics in a ""pool"" and they don't seem to be attached to the specific review. It would be better for obvious reasons, if they also included them attached. I could have posted 30 good ones, but put up 13. The Zoo is a great place for Photo Bugs AND they even have special ""Photographer"" tours.For the Kids! The Mankiewicz Conversation Carousel ($3 per ride) 64 unique Hand Carved and Painted Figures with a universally accessible standing chariot and California themed soundtrack. And...The PLAY PARK. Now with shade... and water misters, play apparatus, sculptures to climb and grass to run around on. A good all around play park. One of many places good for stopping to picnic. And there are benches randomly placed through out the zoo that are nice to chill out and/or snack on too.In L.A., 1915 is ""historic"" - Look for the The Lion Sculptures - A docent at the Los Angeles Zoo, Gene Arias, set upon a mission to find the abandoned works of art by Italian sculptor Carlo Romanelli, a sixth-generation sculptor from Florence, Italy. It took Arias six months to locate them, but he did, and they were donated back to the city's residents via the Los Angeles Zoo. Hollywood pioneer William Selig hired Romanelli to create statues of lions and elephants for the arched entrance to the film studio and zoo he founded in the Lincoln Park area of East Los Angeles in 1915.The Zoo is just really ""Zen""... the layout, the shade, the ability to find quit space no matter how crowded the zoo is. It really adds to the ""Jewel"" that is Griffith Park. And the Autry Museum is right next door! (across from the entrance, actually) So if you are feeling ambitious and making ""good time"" you can do both. The Autry is not that big, can be viewed fairly fast and easy and even has ""Free Days"" (check on line). Membership pays for itself after a few visits and I highly recommend it. Comes with free passes to take guests, so that is always a treat when you have visitors or an afternoon to fill.The BAD:I took the Tram once... and never again. I thought maybe the driver would talk a bit about the zoo as we rode or at least we'd have a pleasant ride. But instead we just breathed butane fumes all the way as the tram stopped a ridiculously amount of times after very short distances to load and unload strollers. Weekends are to be avoided if possible. As in, parking may not even be available and the crowds will simply take away from the experience once inside.Biking through Griffith Park and back along the L.A River Bike Path (or vice versa) for a day at the Zoo makes a great day. One glaring problem - if you want to ride the Bike Path along the L.A. River, the ONLY way to access it is to go into the street full of cars merging onto the freeway. The river entrance/exit is not well marked either. The narrow road has no bike lanes, there is not a sidewalk. It can be downright harrowing with young kids. And it's an ""official"" bike path entrance/exit too. Stupid!The UGLY:I find the new ""V.I.P. Parking"" in poor taste. And I have told them so. I saw them charge a family 3 mins. after the deadline, when it was supposed to be opened back up free to park. One could tell by the exchange between the family and attendant, that the fee was a financial burden but the entire parking lot was full. Except for the ""VIP"" section. It had plenty of spots that previously would have been available for any member of the community to use. Not just the ones that could afford it. I feel they should raise revenue in other ways. I offered management good options on ways to do so, too. Reminded me of our new ""Fast Trac"" Freeway Lanes. Public funded car pool lanes are no longer available to citizens unless they pay... again.The Zoo contributing to the ""Class Divide"" is just wrong.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bentheredunthat

50,Amazing zoo and day!,"This is a great zoo. TONS of animals. Lot of different kinds that you may not see at other zoos. The animals seem very well taken care of and have nice exhibits. They just started a new lunch menu at the front of the park and it was delicious with lots of choices (wraps, sandwiches, salads, macaroni and cheese, hamburgers etc.) I have no idea what the complaint of no animals was, they must have walked around for 10 minutes, because every exhibit I went to had at least one animal in it. The gorilla exhibit is the awesome.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jwilliamstravel
40,a good regular family zoo,"This zoo is quite large and hilly, so bring good walking shoes. When it is hot, it's true your wont see all the animals, but that is really just a standard idea about animals, not this zoo. The exhibits are good, but it is true, the path is like a maze. The flow of the walkway doesn't make it so that you see all the animals if you are walking in one direction, so some back and forth is necessary",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EliE706
10,Holiday family outing,A disappointing experience. We basically walked around. No animals to see. The only filled animal cages were the giraffes. Where were the animals?? This is what we went there for??,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/laurao705

I wasn't impressed to say the least.The weather in LA in known to be hot, so most of the animals were hiding in the shade and there was very little to see, id advise visiting on a cool day.I left after 1 hour, then had to wait well over an hour for a bus to take me back to Hollywood",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tfage
40,LA Zoo,"Part of our vacation plan is to visit a zoo. We selected this zoo becuase of its high rating. Unfortunatly, it's way below our expectations. We have been to many zoos, but this is one of less than avarge. You need to search for the animals in their cages to see them. The over all housekeeping is low. Some of the animals seem sick. The worst is the route inside the zoo. It is a maze. You have to go back and fourth to be able to seee all the areas. If you are looking for a good physical excersice, then go there. I would not go again and I do not recommend it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Khalid_almulhim
30,Old fashioned zoo,We were a little bit disappointed with our visit. The zoo looks old fashioned and some of the houses dirty and not in good shape. It seems that a lot of animals do not have the space as modern zoos offer. Should be renovated.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tombe253
50,Take your niece or another child.,It is always fun to take a kid to the zoo. I took my niece and we had a swell time. Well kept and accessible I had a nice time strolling the grounds and taking my niece to her favorite animals.

50,Awesome Zoo,I am a member of the Oregon Zoo so that is what I have to compare to but the LA Zoo is great. There were only 2 exhibits that did not have the animals out so we got to see a ton.The variety of animals is great. Many things I had not seen in any other zoo. The layout was nice and really spread out the crowds. It is very hilly so be ready for a workout or plan accordingly. There is the safari tram you can take of you don't want to walk.You can bring your own lunch in so you don't have to pay $$$ for lunch. I do recommend the shaved ice of it is a hot day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JW787

50,ONE OF THE LEADING ZOOS IN THE WORLD!,This is one of the leading zoos in the world and with good reason. Many of the animals have expansive habitats to reside in rather than cages as in many other zoos around the world. It was fun to view the tigers across their moat that divides the public from the animals--a much different experience than watching a tiger pace back in forth in a small cage. I loved the children's zoo where I was able to pick up and pat a baby goat! So cool! :),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traveltoforeignlands
40,family fun,Great place. Alot of animals to see. The actual zoo had all the exhibits relatively close together so the walk was not long. Had alot of fun. Kids really enjoyed it. I prefer over San Diego Zoo.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ccggonzalez
20,Worst Zoo Ever,The zoo was horrible. The exhibits are tiny for most of the animals and we could hardly see any of the animals because of the poor design. Lots of things were closed down as well and the zoo smelled worst ghan most other zoos. I feel we could have spent our time and money somewhere better.poorly designed .

40,"Go on weekdays and preferably early morning to avoid the crowds, purchase tickets online to avoid waiting in ticket line","Prepare to walk a lot just like most other zoos. Some of the exhibits were closed but for the most part, the animals were out and about. Going on a weekday definitely helps out a lot as well and go a bit early since there may be school trips during the later part of the day. Admission was $20 and there was a huge line forming in the ticket office.

40,Nice Weekend Trip,"Wasn't too crowded when we went, but it was really hot for October. There's a good amount of Trees and indoor areas. The price is reasonable. Some animals were not out when we went. Not sure why. It was fairly clean. Not too much trash/litter... although it wasn't spotless. Food was decent too. Would come again!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DJMorningstarrr
10,Not Good,We did not enjoy this zoo. Not well done or what you would expect for a large city like LA. Very confusing to navigate the zoo from the map. Habitats did not look natural. Seemed a little run down. Just expected more based on the area and the cost.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lekishaw
40,Fun day,"Our visit to the zoo included are small granddaughter and she was to see all the animals. The elephant training exhibition very very entertaining and education. Pathways are well marked with easy access, the grounds are well maintained and for the amount of use, the restroom areas pretty clean. For the little ones that merry go round is a must-do.

40,Nice zoo,"I went during the week so the experience was much better than going on the weekend, I would imagine. The zoo was alright. I love animals so I enjoyed going and viewing all the animals, as there are a LOT of species here, but I also felt a little sad as some of the larger animals definitely did not seem content. The black bear, in particular, almost brought me to tears as the poor animal was struggling to cool down in the intense desert heat. He/she was panting and drooling as he/she moved around seeking better shade. It was absolutely heartbreaking. Still, overall, the zoo was a nice zoo and better than other zoos I've been to. I would ONLY recommend going during the school week or it's going to be a terrible time. During the school week the lack of crowds made it worth the trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wanderlight_moments
30,It was okay,"I hadn't been here since elementary school, so almost 20 years? And it was okay. The one thing that made me feel bad was one of the primate enclosures. Those poor animals had patches of hair missing. I can only assume it's a sign of those poor critters being under stress. It was really sad.But everything else was pretty cool.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lizzie_almeida
30,Zoo Needs Upgrading,"Visited the zoo recently for the first time in decades and found it a bit sad. Lots of deferred maintenance, poor signage, and empty or damaged enclosures. Plenty of unhealthy food available for purchase, however. If you have limited time during your LA visit don't waste your time here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/433edwardg
50,Great for Big Kids too!,"Took out-of-owners for a lovely afternoon at the LA Zoo. We had forgotten how pleasant and fun it is to visit, even without a stroller in tow! Clean facilities, easy access to all exhibits, plenty of parking. Don't miss the howler monies and the elephants!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NancyOandOscarO
50,BREW at the ZOO was fantastic!,"Ok..this isn't technically a review of the Zoo, as we went to the annual Brew at the Zoo event. 35 specialty brewers were there, along with pub-grub style food available for purchase. It was fantastic!...really enjoyed some great IPAs, red Ales, and some of the 'unusual' brews - ok, some of the unusual brews, not so much....but there were plenty of alternatives to choose from. We heard they used to have food trucks, but banned them this year due to crowd rowdiness(?)...not sure if that was the real story, but I think the food service and selection would have improved with the vendors having their trucks....some of the set-ups were pretty minimal and sparse in the offerings. The music was great, with wonderful variety. The band near the front entry had a solid 'Ventures' sound going and cranked all night. The karaoke with the LIVE BAND at the back was a hoot...as usual, some who could sing, some who could not, all entertaining...kudos for the musicians who provided the karaoke music...they were real troopers to get some of these folks through this. Lots of LA cop presence, especially at the entrance and they were SUPER courteous, nice, and was good to have them around. Even though the beers were only 5 oz., I guessing there were folks who supplemented their intake with something else as there were some near 'falling down' condition 2/3s of the way through the event. Lots of taxis and uber? drivers there to keep them off the hi-way. The event was also designated driver friendly with a special, lower rate for those folks. Would do it again, and would buy earlier to get a VIP pass as those places looked roomier and well accommodated with drinks. yeah, next time.....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EW_Nocona
30,An OK zoo but too busy when we were there and over commercial,"Over from the UK for a family holiday. Mixed views about our visit here. Very busy when we went with no apparent control of this, making it quite hard to actually see things due to the number of people. Very hot with too little shade and not enough water steam coolers. First few hundred metres seems to be nearly all shops and very few animals which was dispiriting. Signage was confusing we went round in circles. Much fanfare about the elephants but very difficult to actually see them well. Some of the animal enclosures were better eg mountain goats, as they were up high we could see them. And of course some nice animals when you can see them. If you are over in the desert/ Palm Springs area then contrast my review of this with the Living Desert zoo which is well done. We bought a joint ticket with LA Zoo and LA Aquarium ( see separate review ) and my comments are pretty much the same for that as for this.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/reviewer64Uk
40,Weekend Staple for Families,"During our many years living in Los Angeles, the LA Zoo became a go-to place for us almost every weekend with our toddlers. We got the Family membership and made great use of it. Our kids particularly liked the elephant feeding at 11 am, the gorillas, and of course the carousel. The carousel is pretty steep at $3 a ride, w/no discounts for multiple rides or members, but nice choice of zoo animals for kids to choose from. Adults ride free accompanying toddlers. 2 benches available for babies.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/772derekf

I particularly love reptiles and the Lair they have has reptiles I have never seen before. Please go and support the zoo.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Heathernelson445
30,Nice Zoo for humans but I question the animals,The LA Zoo is a nice attraction and probably was a nice one in 1980. The whole zoo needs an updating. They have a nice selection of animals and I can see that the trainers and zoo keepers care about them but the poor animals are packed into areas that are far too small for them and the habitats are such that they have not kept up with the current trends in taking care of animals. The Central Park and Bronx Zoos have done a better job with updated to make the habitats more stimulating for the animals as well as more attractive for the patrons. It is nice to visit but keep in mind the looks on most of the animals faces and you will understand that they think their cramped and bored.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R4960NKjustinw
40,Good zoo,"A good zoo with a wide range of animals to see, you do have to bear in mind the heat and that most of the animals will be asleep, but that didn't hamper our enjoyment.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/647davep
40,Great family attraction!,"Zoos are an easy way to entertain the entire family. The animals are mostly visible, but when the temperature gets hot, they are in shaded areas. The walk is not easy with one with strollers as there are many winding up and down paths. But with the layout of the zoo, it gives a respite to see the many big and small animals. We were not able to see any of the special encounters with the animals, but got a good feeling of their habitats especially in the Rainforest of the Americas exhibit and the Elephants of Asia. Don't bother with the food in the restaurant-overpriced and not especially good. I would have preferred to pack a lunch and splurge on an frozen treat! Parking is free and if you can locate a discount on admission, it will make it a fun day. Admission for adults and children over 13 is $19.00, seniors is $16.00 and children from 2-12 is $14.00. Try to go when the weather is not too hot!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PepperNewJersey
50,Come visit the LA Zoo!,"This zoo offers an experience for the entire family. Not only can you just visit all of the animals they have here, you can also learn about the preservation efforts they have in place to ensure the care for endanger species such as the California Condor. They also have a play area with tables, where can you can have a picnic. Additionally, they have a train that goes around and you can hop on-and-off at different locations of the zoo. The Los Angeles Zoo and Botanical Gardens is a wonderful place to visit; if you are a local, I highly recommend purchasing membership.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NancyMeetsTheWorld
30,Waste of time and money.,"Difficult to walk around especially with a baby stroller (you either climb up or go down). It's also easy to get lost because of the poor display of the signs. Half of the animals were hidden due to the heat (which I assume happens often in LA). In general, it was a disappointing experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/izas548
50,Perfect day!,"I took my teenager grandson and his girlfriend during the week which was perfect! No crowds, easy parking! Mostly summer camp buses in the parking lot! Bring an umbrella or the spots in the zoo where it might not have enough shade especially if you are taking your time walking between exhibits! Ok to bring in a picnic lunch but several food kiosks and restaurants are available as well as drink vending machines! Stay hydrated!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ItsHoku
30,Average zoo,Some cool animals. A lot of walking and animals seem to be pretty spread out. Good for a one time visit in my opinion.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ncullen12
40,Enjoyed our day at the Zoo!,"This zoo experience was better than my expectations. The enclosures for the animals were spacious, appropriate habitats and all were very clean. Many of the animals were captive born and the chimpanzee troupe is the oldest in the United States with Gravndma aged at 48 yrs.! The walkways were wide so crowds with numerous strollers were easily accommodated. The map wasn't the best but between the signs and help from zoo employees we found the animals we wanted to see most. Food and water was expensive but we were pleasantly surprised at how good our grilled chicken sandwich with fries was. We spent approx. 4 hrs. there and didn't see all the exhibits. A great time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PJ38
40,Family day/rhino visit,Loved the koala bears and hippos. We have traveled to other zoos and never saw those animals up close. Paid the extra to pet and feed the white Indian rhino. I would highly recommend. The animals are very close and the zoo was clean. They are upgrading so some exhibits were closed but still a good day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MelissaP230
40,"""Great zoo at a bargain price""","Great place to spend a day at the LA Zoowith the family, has a good number of exhibits that can be viewed in just a couple hours or half a day. The entire zoo sits on the side of a hill the trek is up and down so bring comfortable shoes. There's also a small petting zoo with sheep's and small goats. With a couple of exceptions(some of the exhibits) this is a very good zoo.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/men2za
40,One of the Country's Great Zoo,"The Los Angeles Zoo is large and has many animals that you'll not see many other places. The grounds are nicely landscaped, and they have mist pads for the animals and for the humans. The LA Zoo will take most of a day, and does involve hills, some wear comfortable shoes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/825philipm
50,we spent 30 minutes in the Rain Forest exhibit watching the giant sea otters teach their pups to swim. The best enterta,The LA zoo is great. The chimp exhibit was phenomenal. The rainforest was fantastic. Even saw a short necked giraffe. Weird. Pay the 3 bucks to ride the tram. It's get on and off all day. Even includes a little insight from the drivers. We have a zoo membership in Detroit so admission was half price. Remember to bring your membership card.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fred240
50,"A nice day out, also near other attractions",Many animals to see many nice and close. Many activities for the children. The food is a bit limited but still enjoyed. Parking was good. About the same price as here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dallasc947
50,Very reasonable and Very Good Attraction,"Ask Los Angeles residents how many times they have been to the Zoo, and they will tell you several . Plenty of parking, very reasonable rates($).. A little hilly, but they have tram tour, electric wheelchair rental, Stroller, rental.the Zoo is large, well layed out. It is clean, lots of benches, a playground. Some indoor a lot of outdoor exhibits. Several food stops. A little pricy but not out of line with Stadium prices, for example. the food is at least good. You can carry in a picnic lunch. Very nice place to visit. We take friends visiting us there every year.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/695judj
30,Average,There is a large variety of animals here which is good. But a lot of the enclosures were closed when we wend whitch was disappointing. This is a old zoo that really needs some maintenance too keep it up with the high standards from around the world. I felt sorry for a lot of the animals as a lot of the enclosures were way to small they need to take note of how other zoos are doing things these days. There are nice big walk ways so plenty of space for people to move around. We went on a really hot day which was awful as there is along way to walk and for some reason people brough there very young children who did nothing but scream and not enjoy the day or animals at all . Overall I would not return as this is a old zoo that needs a lot of work and there were to many people for the small viewing windows.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Justen78
50,Fun for the Kids!,"I took both of my Kids for a day with my husband and the most they enjoyed was the giraffes, Rhino, and the elephants. I just hope is wasn't that hot the day we went. We will go back soon for our new family adventures! :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/354jeannettev
50,Zonderful Zime at the Zoo,"If your children are at all interested in seeing and learning about animals, the Los Angeles Zoo is the place to do it. There are a huge variety of animals inhabiting the zoo from insects to large mammals, they're all fun to see. I personally enjoy the seeing the huge variety of birds. The Safari Shuttle is something I recommend doing. You can get picked up at various stops and dropped off elsewhere, if you or your little ones get tired. The gift shops have some fun merchandise. The earlier in the day you arrive, the better chances you have of seeing the animals because they tend to hide if it gets too hot. The Los Angeles Zoo is one of the best zoos to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/teachkindy
40,Nice visit,"This is a great Zoo especially with toddlers. The walk is hilly in places but the is lots of space and wide paths, take your time and enjoy the visit. Use the map, the outer trail has lots of empty space with few nimals to view. Plan your route, this can be a long walk and some of the larger enclosures have 2-3 viewing areas. Summer can be hot, we have twice visited at this time of year, stay hydrated to enjoy the experience. Red River Hogs, Gerenuk and Ibex are wme of the more unique and enjoyable animals. The otters are super lively and lions and tigers were a hit with the kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gaylordm
40,Working but decided to take a stroll,Great value for 19 bucks. Pretty warm on my visit so many of the animals were difficult to see but still a clean and fun environment. Great morning walk with a view.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FrinkenVlad
30,Nice Place for Young Children,"The zoo was disappointing because the enclosures were not layed out well or stimulating for the animals. The animals were just there to be displayed, although the enclosures were clean. It appears the zoo needs some serious upgrading and/or to be revitalized. I rated it a three because the zoo does have nice wide, clean paths for young children to walk freely and room for strollers, eating areas for families, a kid's playground area, and clean restrooms. It is a nice place for parents and children to interact and spend a day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/625meic
30,Great disappoint,We took out 2-year old grandson to the zoo and were so disappointed. Many of the exhibits were empty. The signage was almost non-existent which made the map hard to follow. The enclosures looked old and unkempt. We had already taken him to the SD Zoo and there was no comparison. LA needs to upgrade its zoo.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sa-i44
40,Good for a half day with the kids,Well maintained with a good selection of animals. Nice wide paths and well marked and labeled. Better than many zoos but for the truly interested nothing beats the San Diego Zoo.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SDwalkerSOCAL
30,Average zoo,"My wife and I decided to bring our little one to the Zoo last month, the parking looked like a zoo however we were guided by a parking angel and was fortunate enough to get a spot infront of the Zoo entrance immediately.The queue for the tickets were really long when we got there so I had a bring idea of buying the ticket thru my phone and voila, skip the line and go straight to the entrance. So for everyone, here's a tip, use your phone to buy the tickets to skip the lines!The zoo was pretty straight forward, compared to SD zoo, this is a more intimate (aka small) zoo. My daughter enjoyed seeing the animals however for whatever reason, the elephants were hiding so she was not able to see them.concession stands were fairly fast in serving hot lunches where they have fries, burgers, chicken fingers, etc. The drinks are refillable and if you buy the special cup, you can bring it back if you're planning on visiting the zoo in another day.The trash bins in every concession stands were pretty full and no one was cleaning it out, it was basically overflowing.It was a fun day for my family but I'd go to San Diego Zoo next time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JMan604
50,The Zoo is awesome,"I hadn't been here in a very long time. My daughter really wanted to come so we did. It was great. The new elephant exhibit is huge. Great information on all the animals, habitats and locals.FYI: free parking...come early.Tram around the zoo is totally worth it if you have little ones. We took the tram up to the top and walked down the west side of the zoo. Then took the tram up again and walked down the center. They also allow you to bring drinks and snacks.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/980tuesdayt
40,Great place for children,If you've been to a zoo then it is almost the same thing you are going to see. LA zoo is different somehow due to the beautiful gardens and walkways in it. A nice two hour walk with family in the afternoon. Young children will definitely enjoy .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Yoy555
50,LA Zoo Coupons Make It Well Worth The VIsit!!,"LA Zoo is already priced pretty decent but with a family of 4 it can still ad up so I searched everywhere I could to find some good discounts first. This is one place that is not easy to find a good coupons for. I got lucky though, the LA CitySavver was giving almost 40% off admission for 4 so I got a pretty good deal for my family from their site CitySavver.com . I thought the zoo was great, it wasnt quite as big as what I had imagined but well worth it. The animals were very taken care of and you could tell they kind of enjoyed being there compared to some of the other zoos ive been to in the past.The tigers were so cool, I love seeing animals like that, I dont know what it is but it makes me feel like im in the jungles of africa or something. Im not sure if I would still go if I had to pay full price but with a good coupon I think its hard to pass up. My 6 year old son also loved this place!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tamaram339
30,normal,It was a huge Park really but nothing to see. It was very disappointing pantherawith some placea was closed. We ve couldnt see them.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/307ahmadt
30,A bit dissapointing!,"It was a decent zoo. I've seen better I've seen worse. Didn't really think it was worth the $35 to get in. The animals were well maintained which I respected but at the time of my visit there were many exhibits being worked on so they were closed. Made the most of what I could and enjoyed my time. Wouldn't go back but would be a decent place to take young children if it isn't too hot, because there are a few hills to lug stuff up and down.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PennStatePilot
30,Average Zoo,"This zoo is located in an area which has hills and difficult to navigate if you have mobility issues. The food and drinks are expensive so bring your own food. Admission is average for zoos. There are a lot of animals, some areas were closed, by all in all worth a trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jimmieddd
40,Lots of variety!,No only is there a very large variety of animals to see but there is a lot of shade and nice walkways. It is very easy to get around this zoo. The only down side was several attractions were closed but it was still worth it to visit the zoo with our granddaughter!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BlkRaven2u
40,Great Zoo,"My family use to take me here as a child. It's still a great place, however, it is a little pricey. Bring your own water and snacks.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nycbkmom
30,well spread out and hilly,"Liked: price reasonable. Nice gift shops for a zoo.Disliked: parked in the pay lot and the parking employees there were rude, unhelpful. Very crowded and waited 20 minutes on line just to pay to get in. Quite a few animal exhibits were closed. Very hilly, long distances between exhibits, not as nice as Bronx Zoo or San Diego Zoo - save the zoo visits for San Diego or your hometown",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bornnorb
50,One of the best zoos,"Visited during spring break with kids 9 and 15. Expectations were moderate because of our experience with zoos in New York, Washington DC, Philly, Miami, but this zoo is definitely near the top. Reasonable size (compared with Bronx and National Zoo), not too mountainous, yet with a great variety of animals, including koala bears, kangaroos (some with little ones in their pouches), a tapir, elephants, zebras, giraffes, monkeys and the other usual zoo animals.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danielh5
40,Nature Feels Good Here:),Visited the LA Zoo With My Teens ...and fell as we were running freely throughout a land of nature jungle.. Detailed zoo filled with lots of fun!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/502jackier
40,"Good - better than average, less than very good....would give it 3 and half rating...","If you live locally, or in US, purchase a year-long membership - it is tax deductible and you have free entrance for a year - $55 for individual - and you get reduced entrance to other zoos in the USA and discount in the shop.I have been a member of London and San Diego Zoo in the past - the LA zoo is smaller and not quite as pristine, but a most enjoyable experience, if you choose your time wisely!I love to get there at 10 am, as it opens, with my camera ready to go. There are always school groups there in the morning, the trick is to walk faster than them and head up and away to the right, towards the elephants, and work your way anti-clockwise! Most people/packs of children, stay left and go down hill. I am pretty much alone for an hour, fun time to shoot, breakfast is arriving and the weather is cooler...great chance to get some lovely photos. Since I am a member, I like to swing by for an hour or so, then leave...I tried to go the other day, having forgotten that it was Easter Break - they were charging $6 for preferred parking and the place was packed - I drove around the parking lot and drove straight back out!So, avoid vacation/holidays if you want a peaceful experience. Try to get there early and choose days that are cooler/cloudy/rainy as the animals are more animated; when it's really hot, it's REALLY hot and no fun for us or them.It is a beautiful park to wander around, on the backside of Griffith Park, so you can get a bit of exercise in and see the animals.Most of the creatures seem happy, and the zoo keepers know their names and seem to genuinely happy to be there. There are many volunteers ready to give information and advice.For me, wandering in the cool morning air, talking to my favorite animals, snapping pictures and getting a mini-hike in is one of my favorite ways to start a day off work!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YvonneM806
40,Fun Day!,"The LA zoo is a great place to spend the day with your family or even on a date. The animals are plentiful, the zoo spotless and the food not too bad!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1funmum
30,The big cats (and others) need more room,"Say you had to spend the rest of your life in a 100 sq ft cell. Sure you have shelter, but wouldn't you just go stir crazy after a while. These are animals who would typically have territories spanning miles. The enclosures at the LA zoo made me feel sorry for the large animals that have a roaming instinct. I will say that the animals did appear well care for.I hadn't been to the LA zoo for at least 15 years. Most large animal enclosures are actually larger now then the were back in 90's. If I wait another 15, maybe I can see the animals and not feel sad.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/982BarbaraS
50,Awesome place,One on the best places to spend a little time with family and friends... Love this place a lot ...its just awesome and fun..,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/50christg
40,Zoos are amazing for kids,Don't mistake my title. My wife and I love zoos. Both our boys worked at the SF Zoo and absolutely enjoyed their time there. The LA zoo is a lot like the SF zoo - not as a negative but these zoos need attention. The kids absolutely love zoos. 5 minutes in a zoo and you can tell. The LA zoo is a nice exhibit but needs some TLC. If you have kids in the LA area consider taking them to the zoo. We enjoyed it a lot and that's coming from me - whose not the zoo addict.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AJAhearn
20,Disappointed,"Traveling with family a group of 10, and a lot of the exhibits were closed... and no animal show... we paid to walk the zoo and it felt like the zoo was closed. My recommendation for families going to thw zoo call to see how many exhibits are closed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fran83Vazquez
50,Love it.,I took my son for the first time and he loved this place! He was so excited to see all the animals and everything this has to offer. His favourite was seeing the flamingos and the giraffes. DEfinitely buy tickets in advance because the line can get VERY LONG.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GraiceC
20,Dissapointing Experience,"Based on expectations set by visits to other major zoos including San Deago and Philadelphia I was very disappointed with the LA Zoo experience. From the dirty canopy and dirty glass at the ticketing pavilion I found the overall facility in need of maintenance and a major face lift. Exhibits are difficult to view through dirty glass and unkept hedges that block kids views. Animal habitats are old school and the animals understandably appear board.Asked what their favorite thing was, our grandchildren both responded ""the carousel"". I would agree and will take them to the Santa Monica pier next time and save $66.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VimMcG
50,A great place to spend the day,Really great place to wander and lose yourself. The gardens are beautiful. The animal exhibits are really well done and the animals seem well taken care of. We had a great time here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CAndrewSemon
40,Worth 3-4 hours if local,"Visited the zoo with a buddy of mine and our young children. Overall, cool experience and comments based on us visiting on a weekend:Buy tix in advance! Line could be long to purchase at venue.Get there when it opens. Less people there and animals are up and being fed!See the elephants do their daily training excersise @ 11am daily. Our kids loved it (and so did the grown-ups!).We didn't see any shows and were basically done by about 1pm... Which was great because it was getting really crowded.If you live in the area, go. If you are visiting from out if town, drive the 1.5 hrs to San Diego Zoo!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JaimeCA
50,Beautiful place,Bought a voucher on living social. As did most others on Presidents' Day weekend. It took about 20 minutes to get to the parking lot from the freeway exit. But the member line was quick and the park is big enough that I rarely felt cramped. Took the shuttle to the top and worked our way down. Packed our lunch and had a picnic at the park while the kids played. Many things have been created/ updated since our last visit and serve to enhance the park experience. Kids had a blast and the only downside was sore legs the next day from the hills.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ronaldv304
40,Nice Walk on the Wild Side!,"The Zoo and botancal gardens are a nice quickescape from the city in the city! Hidden in the hills in Los Angeles, you can walk among the the wild surrounded by hills, greenery, vegatation, natural beauty of nature and wild life. You forget about the hustle and bustle of the rat race going on right outside! Lots of great exercise walking. The grounds are large enough to accomodate many differnt species of vegatation and animals but not to large that you cant see everything. There are different animall encounters, feeding and training demonstrations, great places to eat and area for children to play. The animals look great, healthy and well fed! The Zoo itself is very clean and well landscaped. FREE audio tour via cell phone! Reasonably priced entrance fee and NO FEE for parking!! L.A. weather is usually pretty good so a visit to the zoo will make a really great family day that doesnt cost an arm and leg (Unless you put your arm and leg in a tiger enclosure)!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mariannem978
30,old zoo #2,"While the Los Angeles zoo is indeed seeing a great deal of over-due renovations for the animals, their ticketing procedures remain in the last century. All tickets must be printed out AT HOME and presented to enter the zoo. Even movie theaters have eticket printing machines for on-site pickup. In a time where everyone and their grandmother have some form of smartphone or tablet, digital tickets should be accepted. Especially since tickets in any form are not even collected. Save a tree, start scanning digital image barcodes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/789jenb
40,Need More Time,"Thinking two 8 year old boys could only last for 2 hours we decided to go to the zoo on a lovely Sunday afternoon at 3pm, figuring some of the crowds would have left by then. To some extent it was a good move and for others not so much.Pros: We got a good parking space in the free parking lot. As we were walking in, streams of people were walking out. I was pleased to see that it is a very multicultural crowd (with way too many baby strollers). Lots of lovely adorable animals to see including the baby hippo. baby monkeys, baby koala, baby otters, baby giraffe.Cons: Figuring that the zoo is open til 5pm, we figured we'd have 2 solid hours to see the animals. NOT SO! Not only do they begin to put the animals away at 4pm, they also begin to shuffle you toward the exits. After paying $66 for a family of 4 to enter the zoo, we were not about to be pushed out early, however, after 4pm there is not a lot to see. If they are going to close the exhibits at 4pm, then they should close the zoo at 4pm. If they are open til 5pm, they should be open til 5pm. We knowingly came late in the afternoon, but totally expected a 2 hour visit to the zoo. We feel like we were tricked. $66 is a lot of money for an hour. TOTAL RIP OFF!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/panama2000
40,"Aging facilities, but superb collection of animals","Saw many of most popular animals not always seen at major zoos nowadays. Seeing baby giraffes, baby kangaroos, and baby chimpanzees were a real treat. Climate is wonderful for visitors. Lush semitropical vegetation was everywhere. Many exhibits were closed for renovation. Guide map was sometimes difficult to match to exhibits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/roadwarrior96
30,Not As Good As SD Zoo But Good Enough,Is it as good as the SD Zoo? Maybe not but it's still very nice and offers an alternative to LA visitors. I'm not a big fan of zoos but LA zoo seems decent enough.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SedaEg
30,Disappointing,"The zoo is in a lovely setting and very accessible. This was our first visit and our initial impression was good as we entered the complex. However once past the concessions we became less impressed. The enclosures are small and the animals have little to do. Many of the exhibits were closed for renovation annoyingly but I expect by next year things will have improved. The best enclosure we thought was the river otters. The baby Hippo was cute and the condor put on a great show for us.The botanical areas were less than impressive but it is January!All in all for a family with young children there are lots of play areas , lots tof space and the carousel.All in all we enjoyed seeing it but won't be returning.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PaulineM959
30,Improving but Still has a Long Way to Go,"Living 40 minutes away, I visit the zoo, maybe every other year or so. There are some really nice exhibits and many run down exhibits. Too many enclosures with nothing in them. Lots of food options, and since we went at Christmas, very well decorated. Not having to pay for parking is another bonus.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DiabloDeb
40,Nice Zoo,"I attended the zoo mid last year when I needed to do a research project for my physical anthropology course. I went to this zoo because it was the first zoo I ever attended as a child in fourth grade when I lived in Los Angeles. I think this is a beautiful medium size zoo. I was slightly disappointed with the lack of shade and the lack of the wax animals that are no longer being sold there anymore. I was also disappointed by the botanical garden it looks rundown but otherwise I was content. I enjoyed my visit. The gorilla exhibit is pretty fascinating. I would recommend this zoo due to affordability, good size, and family friendly enviroment.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/em74365
20,Boo on this zoo,"This zoo is cramped and poorly designed. It was over crowded, too many people were allowed in and it was hard to get around. somewhere between 10 to 20 percent of the exhibits were closed. For 19 dollars Ii expected a little more. The best thing about this zoo is the free parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StevenM46
40,love the zoo,"This is a great zoo. The only drawback here is the lack of shade on hot summer days can practically kill you...otherwise LOVE it. The staff nice. The animals seem as happy as they can in captivity. It's not as interactive as some animal parks, but they do bring out little critters for up close meet and greets as well as the petting zoo. The sloth and gorillas are my favorite. I've spent hours upon hours hanging out watching them. I used to go at least one day a week until it got cold. We even checked out the Christmas light event, which was ok but not spectacular. It's a much bigger zoo with a wider variety of animals than I had expected before becoming a member. Go!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Puppetgirldotnet
10,"Awful Zoo, Such a Sad Place to Keep Animals","Keeping animals in tiny enclosures might have been okay 50 years ago, but it is absolutely unacceptable in 2015. The poor elephants were in a space so small it was criminal. A dusty pen surrounded by chain link fence, no trees, no bushes, no toys. The animals were engaging in repetitive behaviors indicating that they were both bored and stressed. Elephants are really smart and should not be kept in what amounts to a jail cell. The enclosure for the lions was no better. Small, poured cement pit with the typical ""moat"" in front. The poor lion was pacing back and forth; what a life. Most of the animals at the zoo seemed very depressed, and no wonder. Very little space in their enclosures, too many people too close to them, shouting at them. And, if you do want to actually find out about the animals you are seeing, you won't get much information from the signs in front of the cages. This zoo charges quite a bit to get in. Save your money and skip this.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rubbertgator
40,Nice medium-sized zoo,"My husband and I visited the LA Zoo durin the week of New Years. It was a very nice facility. It appears quite clean and the animals are all pretty visible. We especially enjoyed The Liar which has reptiles and snakes. If you have young children, this is a nice zoo because it is not as much walking as maybe the San Diego Zoo but still enough iof a variety of animals to hold their interest. My only complaint (which is no fault of the zoo itself) is the number of huge double strollers with either one or no children in them or kids that appear to be about 8 years old riding. Come on people, let the kids walk!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/debbbiew
30,Cool experience,"Took my daughter and her friend as a part of her 8th birthday celebration to the LA Zoo lights experience. The lights were pretty cool and the girls had fun on the carousel. They loved the reindeer and the place where Santa would have been looked nice. We were there on New Year's day, though, so he was gone. I was not impressed, however, that when you purchase the tickets online it says ""View real reindeer, visit with Santa (on select dates), and enjoy holiday treats and goodies, all under the stars."" This makes it sound like you receive holiday treats and goodies with your tickets so I was expecting at least some hot chocolate on the cold night but everything is for purchase so we paid an extra $2.50 each for a hot cocoa. I'm also surprised there is no military discount. First zoo I've ever been to without one.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jenm993
50,Great Zoo Great Exhibits,"We recently visited LA pre-cruise and only had one day to spend seeing some sights. We are so glad that we picked the LA Zoo. Our daughter works with animals as a trainer and was amazed at the variety of animals and exhibits that were available for her to see. It is very clean and the animals have alot of room to move around. While there is a bit of walking, the fun thing is that on your walk there are alcoves with some very interesting exhibits. There is a new Hippo and Giraff, only a few months old. There were even reindeer which was nice for the holiday season. There are several resonable places to eat and the food was quite good. If you do not have a car, as we did not, you can reach the zoo either by bus or cab for a very reasonable price. If you have children or a love for zoos then you should definately give this AZA zoo a try. You will not be disapointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RPapaleo08

Of course you have the smell but the staff tries to keep up with it and they do a good job of it.

A Fine Place To Pass The Day",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wmguinm
50,Love this place,"Every time we visit LA we take our grand kids to this Zoo. It's so well laid out and the animals are beautifully displayed . It's the most favoured attraction for the children , and never fails to give us all a great day out. To add to all this, we went to the Lights, a holiday event in December held in the evening after the Zoo is closed, although all the animals are asleep, the transformation by the glorious lights and lasers made the visit truly thrilling",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gilly220
50,Well done LA Zoo!,"The grounds were fantastic and well maintained. Good selection of different animals- lions and tigers and bears and oh so much more: markhor, takin,ibex,bongo, gharial...) . The zoo was decorated for the xmas lights and I imagine it would be gorgeous but I was visiting in the daytime. Plenty of free parking. Many food options in the zoo. Staff members were informed, helpful, and friendly. Not crowded at all which was nice for viewing the animals and keeping a good pace. I read quite a few reviews of people complaining of the animals hiding. That was NOT my experience in fact, quite a few of the animals came right up to me like they were trained to do so and show off ( giraffes, otter, gorilla, markhor, meerkat, and peacock to name a few). Loved the large tank with fish and turtles in the amphibian center. Too many snakes in the center for my tastes, but that's just me. Seems like everyone's kids really enjoyed the amphibian center as well. The animals seemed well cared for and enjoying their enclosures. I walked the entire zoo and I didn't feel it was too much even with the hills. The only negative would be that some of the enclosures have fairly tight holed netting making the viewing obscured ( lemurs, eagles, some of the cats). I had a wonderful afternoon and would highly recommend. The koalas were so cute!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/739DavidJ
50,Wonderful Relaxing Adventure for a day!,"Great place to visit! Even in November, the animals were entertaining the day we were there! Can't predict when the animals will be out and about. Realize they have their patterns and may not be out. I think going late morning early afternoon is a good time. Even in the city, you felt as if you were in another place. We went on a Tuesday, so it wasn't real full, but there were quite a few people there. If you had questions, the staff was eager to answer and give you more information on the animal in question. The map is ok, but you can get around just fine. You go about as you wish, there are safari's you can take for an extra charge, if you want a guided tour as well. Don't miss this when you visit LA. Not hard to get to, just be sure you get off at Zoo Drive on the 5. GPS isn't quite right with it. Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Brendermac
50,Los Angeles Zoo fun fun fun,We. Took our young niece and nephew to the LA Zoo. It was wonderful. What was said for me was my parents took us to the zoo many times when we were kids. I forgot how wonderful the zoo is. I was reminded by my niece and nephew by the joy the zoo brought them. The animals are very exciting to see. The food was good. The staff at the Zoo was knowledgeable and kind. I recommend the petting zoo for all ages. Nature in LA it was an incredible day. Whether you live in LA or visiting the zoo is a great family trip. San Diego Zoo here we come.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/401rickyj
40,Good not great!,"Wanted to come last time we were in LA but ran out of time, free parking was a bonus, arrived about 20 minutes before opening, so there were no crowds which was good, tried to walk right to the back of the zoo first then work our way down but just could not understand the map or the lay out, don't think we missed anything out but was never the less a bit annoying, saw the baby hippo that had been born just the day before we went so cute!! Loved seeing the Koalas also never ever thought that I would ever see one in my life! Also the ""Botanical Gardens"" in the title is also a little misleading as they are just dotted all over the park, glad we went but would not need to go again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoeL247
20,La attractions sight seeing,Good to see with family and kids..Even we where a couple but we enjoyed the walk al over the park.Do not gonwjen the sun is high and shining all the animals will be in the shade...so I may not see them if they r hiding.Halloween theme inside the park was a joy to see.Nevertheless I felt sorry for the animals because they where locked :(.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ziadj_13
30,Zoo Good...Signage and Directions Horrid,"I enjoy going to the zoo with our grand daughter. In fact, we have supported the zoo throughout the last several years as members and go perhaps 4-6 times annually. Now the reason I gave it an average rather than very good rating...SIGNS AND MAPS ARE NOT DONE WELL...AND ARE AT TIMES MISLEADING ALTOGETHER. Met a lady from Michigan who tried three times to find the giraffes using maps, signs, and personnel. None worked and at 4:45pm, she gave us saying, I loved what I saw, but it was very difficult getting around in here."" When we tried to find the Giraffes, we saw signs leading one way...Nope...when we came to a fork in the road, signs did not have giraffes listed...asked personnel person, follow to the left, but ""it meanders"" left through plaes...NOPE...nothing. Finally left the elephant area and it was time to leave with the lady from Michigan. The up side for us is that we are local and can go again. PLEASE BE AWARE it is not YOU that is confused...it is the signage and personnel that participate. This really doesn't make sense, a sign audit needs to be done PRONTO if the zoo is going to reach its potential. And one more complaint...the Merry Go Round is fabulous...but at $3 a ride for a quick ride is ridiculous. COME ON MAN...make it better",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CharlieU236
40,Another zoo,"I've been to several zoos around the country, and nothing stood out about this one. I had visited the San Diego zoo last time I was out this way, so I figured I would check this place out. Free parking is available, they do offer preferred parking for a small fee. I found a place to park, walked up to the front, and bought a ticket. I walked around the place, looking at different exhibits. There is quite a bit of walking to do, with a lot of it up and down hills. I really enjoyed walking up the hill near the aviary. There is a neat view, where you are slightly higher up. It is a smaller zoo, so you might find time to see everything in one visit. If you're in the area, and looking for something to do, you may like this place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bbadger187
50,a nice zoo,"a very nice and big zoo, where you can spend time with your little ones and be busy all day long. my son loves the animals there. you will see giraffes, tigers, monkeys, lions, zebras, elephants, pretty much all the animals you expect to see in a zoo.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MashaV_12
40,Fun Day for grandbabies,"I live just minutes from the Zoo, so my family has always had a membership. If you live close, it is great to stop by for a stroll and a visit with the animals. There is plenty of free parking and the food choices are varied and reasonably priced. The Zoo is well kept, however it sits in the hills, so it's all uphill, then downhill. Bring a stroller for the little ones and pace yourself with frequent stops at the exhibits. During the summer there is a horrible problem with bees and wasps so if you are allergic wait for spring or fall to go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dwilcox000
30,Its a well kept zoo,"It is not a big zoo and is situated in a excellent place. Good zoo's are excellent with kids if you have one. Loved the open chimpanzee exhibit. the tram ride was not worth it as using it meant missing out on seeing lot of animal attractions. If you have been in SD zoo, then you may slightly disappointed but then the cost,free parking and being in LA may make up for it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vkailash
40,My Granddaughter Love It,"This certainly not the largest zoo I've been too, but it is well kept up and the animals seem to be managed very nicely. They have large natural habitats.My only real complaint is the amount of up and down hill walking these old bones had to do.She wanted to see the the large mammals first, so that is what we did. I later talked her into going to the reptile and amphibian section and she was fascinated. My work for the day was accomplished at that point.I was fascinated watching an elephant getting a manicure. Obviously it doesn't take much to thrill me, but I really did enjoy it.You can't go wrong here. If you live in the area, it is best to get a yearly family pass, if you think you will use it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChuckR9999
30,Across from the Autry Museum,"It is by far not the best zoo that I had ever been too, but it is a small and intimate zoo for kids. So if you have kids it is worth visiting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TonyaKeittKalule
30,It's a zoo,"Fun for a few hours, not the best zoo I've seen and not the worst. The animals seemed happy enough, so that's a plus.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CaFrancophile
40,Enjoyable,"I enjoyed my day at this zoo. I didn't expect to since I have been to so many zoos and hadn't heard anything great about this one. It was nice though. The lion had a sad look, but he was majestic at the same time. Another big cat- Maybe a jaguar paced the entire time like he was furious. I hope he gets a bigger area to roam in than what we saw him in. The meercats were being funny while we were there as well as a zebra. I enjoyed it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/duane52
50,Great place to take the kids,"The LA Zoo is a great place to visit with kids if you're a local or a visitor. The exhibits are large and extensive, the variety of animals is outstanding and the grounds are beautiful. Buy food or pack a lunch and enjoy the picnic area. The Zoo is easy to reach and easily accessible from anywhere in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Johnwiz
40,LA Zoo,"During the past 30 years the LA zoo has had numerous changes and improvements. I always enjoy visiting the primates, especially the gorillas and my favorites, the chimps.I would prefer to see these animals in their natural environment, but you can see the staff and management are trying their best to make the animals comfortable.We have a family membership that it's price for the year at the same that would cost you for one day with a family of 4, that in itself its a great deal.The environment it's great for families with small kids and for anyone interested in learning about the diversity of our Eco system",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Yoskke
40,It Was A Very Hot Day,"We went on Saturday, and it was a very hot day. We arrived at 10 AM. Handicapped parking was close and available. No lines to wait in for tickets. There was a bit of a wait for a scooter to be brought down to us. We were in a group of ten from ages 1 year to 72 years. There were plenty of ramps for wheelchairs, scooters and strollers. There were plenty of benches in the shade to sit down as you were walking thru the park. The best thing was that there were several water fan areas where you could stand in front of to get cooled off. Early in the entrance gate and up the stairs, there was a fire truck with two handsome fire fighters who took great pleasure in 'hosing' down the kids who wanted to get sprayed. There are several places to get food but be prepared to pay a lot. We got an order of French fries at one place and it was a very small order that cost $4.00. We happened to bring our cooler so when we were ready for lunch, we got the cooler from our car and brought it in where our group met at a picnic area and enjoyed our own lunch. They do allow you to bring in your own coolers with food and drinks, just no glass containers or bottles. We rode the tram and were disappointed that we really didn't get anything out of the ride except a rest from walking. There really shouldn't be a charge for the tram ride. It took just a few minutes and at the last stop, we were pretty close to where we first boarded the tram. Many of the animals were hiding, trying to keep cool. Once we started walking, we did see the mearcats, the big horned sheep, the gorilla, the monkeys, the zebras, the giraffes, the lions, some big ugly lizards, an otter and a few other deer type critters. We stayed til closing and even tho we missed quite a bit of the animals, we still had a good time and enjoyed it all. Not to forget, at the end of the day, one of our girls had a bloody nose outside the gift shop and several employees were very helpful with getting her ice water and being concerned. We appreciated that very much. We even bought a membership when we left too. Would we recommend? Absolutely !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ninee
30,Don't Go On Hot Day,"We had planned on this trip for sometime even thou it was a scorcher 109 in la with humidity. Miserable day , couldn,t get cool. They had lots of cooling stations but it was still miserable. For sure get a tram pass for the day makes it easier to see the zoo and you can hop on and hop off all day helped alot today especially with the hilly terrain over all its a great Zoo but not on a hot days makes it hard to see the animals real disappointing for the grandkids most of the shows were limited due to the animals not being able to perform when its hot we stayed for two and a half hours and the heat drove us home",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tomh389
20,Probably not a good idea on a hot day,Please do not make the same mistake as we did by going to the zoo on an extremely hot day. Animals are just as hot as you are and trying to hide in the shade. It was difficult to see a lot of the animals for this reason.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/454debbiee
30,Okay,When we went most of the animals were hiding.. Not worth it.. It was nothing special. I am not a huge fan of animals but I had hoped for it to be better.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Beets22
40,Hot day at the LA Zoo,"I visited the Los Angeles Zoo in August 2014. I chose to visit on a fairly warm and humid late morning and, unfortunately, had to leave only seeing half of the exhibits due to the sweltering heat. Of course, since the zoo can't control the weather, I'm not faulting the zoo at all for this but it is important to note because it did affect my visit.With that said, the grounds were immaculate and simply beautiful. It had ample parking and an expansive gift shop. Most animals were laying down or not visible due to the heat, but the flamingos were having a ball dipping in the water and walking around. The layout of the zoo made things interesting...there was always more animals to be seen at every turn.I only found a few downsides to my visit: Many of the animals were behind tall chain-link fences which made taking pictures difficult as my camera, more often than not, focused on the fence instead of the animal behind it. Also, although the zoo was filled with beautiful palm trees and landscaping, most of the walkways had no shade at all. Those with fair skin (like me) should take extra precautions with sunscreen, large hats, etc. as you'll be in the sun a lot at this zoo.Even though my visit wasn't as good as I hoped it would be, I still recommend the zoo to others. From what I could tell, the facility has the potential to be a wonderful visit for all, but I strongly recommend visiting when the weather is comfortable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GuitarGuy7
40,good for kids,"we really enjoy it , but i think it should be much better since it's in LA and it's a big city i prefer SEAWORLD San diego",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shady-abedin
50,LA Zoo,"I enjoyed taking my grandson to LA Zoo. The weather was ideal and many of the animals were out. My grandson was disappointed that the gorillas were not as active, as they are his favorite animals. The zoo was very clean and well-kept for the most part. I would like to take my other grandchildren to the LA zoo when they come and visit me soon!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/10juliettej
20,loss of time,We went to zoo late in the afternoon.It was about to close we did not have time to see all animals. Most of the animals were sleeping. There is not a chance to go by golf car it is only half way.There are many betters things to do in LA if your children are not very small :(((,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CansunDemir
40,Fun excursion,"The zoo is easy to reach, an advantage to out of towners like us. Parking is free--hooray! Buy tickets online and waltz right in. That's nice. I loved the volunteers--many of them young people. They were upbeat and cheerful on a hot day. One showed our 5 year olds an elephant hair and had them compare it to their own hair. Another offered to let them handle a snake (they were not interested). All in all, a pleasant outing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ClarkH226
40,Great enclosures....Jurassic Park Entrance Gates,Was a very fun day out. The annual passes are a great deal ( if i remember correctly only double or triple the daily fee). The entrance has Jurassic Park style gates that make you wonder if dinosaurs are inside as well :-). Great day out. Be prepared to walk alot though. The carts that pick you up and drop you off ( fee attached) have very long wait times. Not queues just the turn around time is lenghty.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ali_keepwalking
40,Lots of Animals,"We went early so that we could catch all the animals before they had their afternoon naps and we managed to see all the animals except the Tiger. If you can, take the shuttle to get from point A to B, it's well worth the money, especially if you have young kids who don't want to walk the whole zoo.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AUDREYW897
30,Great day to see the animals,"We went to the Zoo on a Tuesday morning so there were less visitors and to try and beat the heat. It was about 95 when we left at 2PM. I was reading some past reviews and noticing that maybe people are just expecting WAY too much. To begin with, parking is free! Let me tell you something- that's not common people so it should be appreciated. I'd suggest buying tickets online so you don't have to wait in line. It just speeds things up a bit. We took our 18 month old daughter and she loved it. I would encourage you to bring a stroller if you have kids. I didn't understand the lady complaining her kids were tired after walking so much-duh. I will say that we arrived at 11 and left at 2. We saw almost all of the animals except the petting zoo and reptiles because my husband doesn't like those. Another great thing they have is a play area for kids and picnic tables- yes you can bring your own food! I brought our own snacks and water bottles so we didn't pay $5 for water. If you don't spend huge amounts of time at each animal area you can see it all in about 4-5 hours. We took pictures with all of the animals and read the boards and moved on. It was a good day and I felt the workers and volunteers were nice and went out of their way to help. At least two of them told us about exciting things to see like the hippo feeding at 1230. We'd never known had she not asked if we were having a good time and interested in seeing them. Yes, there are bees and bugs but not overwhelming. It's also a botanical garden so remember that. A lot of the animals were sleeping or being lazy for well reasons- it's hot in LA! You can't expect to see every animal roaming around all day long. For the people complaining about the ""Hike"" it's not that bad. My husband wore flip flops, I wore sandals, and so did my 18 month old who walked. It's smaller than any amusement park and there is A LOT more shade. I think some people just complain about every little thing. If you are one of those people maybe rethink your expectations.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amanda42
30,Was more of a hike than a zoo,"Our kids (3 yr. old and 18 month old) were old enough to enjoy and recognize animals so we thought of bringing them to the zoo. It was a first time for all of us to visit the LA Zoo. The zoo has all the animals that you would expect to find in one. The exhibits and cages were big enough for you to see the animals up close. We enjoyed the giraffes, gorillas, elephants, and lions the most.Animals and exhibits aside, here are the reasons we won't be coming back soon. 1) The zoo is on Griffith park grounds so it is not only huge but also on up and down terrain. Wear walking shoes as you will be going up and down hills. 2) Bring strollers - young children will not last. 3) Signs were hard to follow. Trying to follow the signs even with the map was not easy. Most of our time was spent trying to locate the animals. 4) Because the place is huge, the animal exhibits are not close to each other. 5) Expect to spend a whole day if you want to see all the animals.The place was clean and a lot of the areas were updated but we just felt like we spent most of our time hiking up and down hills rather than enjoying the animals. We'll probably come back when the kids are bigger. For smaller children, I suggest going to the Santa Barbara Zoo instead.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hmajuelo
30,About average with a few highlights,"As far as zoos go, the LA Zoo is about average, with sections of dated enclosures with limited information and impressive newer enclosures. The overall size is not too overwhelming and the landscaping provides nice amounts of shade throughout the zoo. The tigers they have are young brothers and were in a very playful mood the day I visited. They swam, wrestled, played with the biggest animal toys you'll ever see, all very visible and healthy tiger behavior. The elephant enclosure is so expansive that I walked the entire perimeter and never managed to see an elephant, but other people saw them and I'm sure the elephants were enjoying hiding in trees. There's a nursery area near the entrance that houses many of the zoos cutest residents- babies! Some zoo babies are with their mothers in the main enclosures, but some need to be separated and are brought to the nursery, it's a little out of the way but definitely worth a few minutes.Food options are standard over-priced attraction food. Bring a water bottle and wear comfy shoes because you will do a lot of walking. Parking is free. A tram that stops around the zoo is available for extra cost. Watch out for bees near trash cans, but remember that bees are an important part of nature and you are technically in a Botanical Garden!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeniseMW
30,"Morning weekdays are quiet, lots of walking","Took our son, 3 years old, to the Zoo. It was a weekday morning, right at 10am opening. Minimal wait to get in. Went straight to the children's petting zoo area. Our boy had his choice of goats or sheep to pet. Next stop was to visit the larger animals. Even though there were lots of busloads of kids, it wasn't too crowded. There is a ton of walking in this zoo. They have a tram, but it takes you on the perimeter of the zoo, and there is a fee. The merry-go-round also has a fee. Bring a stroller, definitely worth it for all the walking. Seems like the easiest animals to see are the elephants (viewing at multiple locations) and primates-monkeys, chimps, gorillas. Had to walk around almost the whole zoo to get to the giraffe and zebra. Feeding time around 11am was a plus, because weather in LA is hot in July, so many animals were seeking shade or sleeping. Had to keep lifting my son up to see the animals, too many barriers he can't see through. Staff takes photo of you inside the entrance, wish they had a bigger logo for their photo, very pricey. Good for two hours for our son, but not much longer. Opted to go to Glendale, right next door, instead of eating expensive zoo food. Compared to San Diego, this zoo has much less to see, but then I'm not forced to pay as much, either.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GiantsFanLosAngeles
30,Been to better zoos,"This was a decent size zoo, but I've been to better. I did get to see a baby koala attached to its mother so I thought that was cool. I went in March and a lot of the animals that I wanted to see weren't on display. Wasn't cold out so I don't know why, but was disappointed. When I go to a zoo, I expect to see animals!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/basketballchick
20,run down and overtaken by bees,"This poor zoo! I can't believe how much it' gone downhill since I lived in Southern CA 10 years ago. San Diego Zoo is the way to go if you can help it. I'm sorry, I feel bad because they obviously need the revenue to fix things, but it's awful.For example, more exhibits were closed than open. They only had one show on the Sunday we went, and it was a bird show shown twice that day. We went to the second showing and they informed us just before the show started that they weren't actually doing the show but a training demonstration. Also, there was hardly any shade and the bees were on full contact alert all over the stands. They were very aggressive. Some people even left before the ""show"" started because of it.Speaking of bees, you couldn't even throw anything away in most of the trash receptacles because the bees had taken them over. And at many exhibits they were buzzing around very aggressively.Many whole sections of the zoo weren't working.On the plus side, they do have a tram that you can pay $4/pp for and take up the hill to walk down through the zoo. It was very hot when we were there.Oh, one more thing, the ""Rain Forest"" section (new) was a major disappointment. I guess I'm just used to what San Diego would include in this type of exhibit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DoreenR694
30,Nice day trip,"When you plan going to the LA Zoo make sure it's a bit colder day. it's not very friendly, and doesn't really make sense walking the premises on a hot day.Another thing is: most of the enclosures aren't photography friendly. Not all of them, but many of them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DaviD_CA_777
30,There are better zoos out there,"Many of the animals were hiding, sleeping, on vacation??? the day we visited. It was very hot so I can't blame the zoo residents for keeping hidden. San Diego Zoo and Wild Animal Park are so much better - more expensive, but worth it. The elephants were nowhere to be seen and my wife asked staff about it. They couldn't even tell us where the elephants were. Strange.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kwazycanucks
20,Meh,"I am not sure how people can call it a Great Zoo. IT is not. I dont suspect animals being active in the heat. Thats totally fine for me when they hide in the shadows. Not fine for me is seeing 2 lions being forced to live in a tiny cave with pretty much No place to hide.I visited a huge amount of animal parks before, but I really expected more of this one here, due to the fact how big the city is. All in all the coolest experience was a) watching a colibri flying around in the beautiful flowers (that u can give the zoo, the botanic is amazing!) And b) observing a squirrel eating nuts.We wont come back. Sorry.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/721minab
40,"""Worth taking the kids to!""","As a child, I remembered my parent’s taking me to this zoo and enjoyed that experience. I actually went to the original zoo when it was named the “Griffith Park Zoo” and before it closed in 1966. On this trip, which was shortly after returning from our trip to Hawaii (April 2013), we drove down on a three day break to Los Angeles to visit both Universal Studios and the Los Angeles Zoo. I got a good package deal from “AAA” (that’s auto insurance, not Alcohol’s anonymous) for hotel and theme tickets.Since I only remembered the zoo when my parents took me as a child, I wanted to relive the experience with my children so they too could say the same thing later in life. Everything about this zoo is different and new to me. Of course, it’s in a new location and much larger. The old zoo was a lot smaller to begin with and didn’t have a Botanical Garden. I was impressed at how this on got up and running, although it had its share of trouble. Here is a little background I found on this zoo:The zoo back then was known as “Griffith Park Zoo” and first opened in 1912 and was located 2 miles away from where it’s currently located today. The zoo closed in August 1966, but remnants can still be seen today.The new zoo was founded that same year and opened in November 1966 and has been expanding ever since over the years to its present size of 133 acres and was formerly the location of the “Roger Young Village.” Here are some milestones:• 1995, the zoo almost lost its accreditation because it was poorly kept until it came under a new director who turned it around.• 1998, opened the “Chimpanzees of the Mahale Mountains,” followed by the “Red Ape Rain Forest.”• 2000, opened the “Komodo Dragon Exhibit”• 2001, opened the “Winnick Family Children Zoo.”• 2005, construction was completed to the “Entry Plaza, Children's Discovery Center and Sea Lion Cliffs (now Sea Life Cliffs), followed by the “Campo Gorilla Reserve.”• 2007, construction completed on the “Elephants of Asia.”• 2012, construction completed on the “LAIR (Living Amphibians, Invertebrates, and Reptiles).”• 2002, became a “certified Botanical Gardens” and renamed the Los Angeles Zoo and Botanical Gardens. With 15 different collections, highlighting 800 plus plant species, for a total of over 7,400 individual plants.This zoo also had some notable escapes from animals over the years (1990’s - 2000’s) when at least 35 animals escaped to include “Zebras, kangaroos, antelopes, and chimps.” No word if they were ever recaptured but every now and then you hear people saying, “Those animals were the ones responsible for this mess!” So, I’m assuming they’re still out there!Another episode was when “Evelyn the Gorilla escaped her enclosure” on five different occasions and was covered by the news media before she was eventually tranquilized. They said their pen was originally built for bears but that all changed in 2007, when they completed construction on the new “Campo Gorilla Reserve.” “I guess they weren’t monkeying around!”And lastly, in 1979, “Virginia the Wolf” escaped the zoo multiple times hiding in Griffith Park and no word of she was ever recaptured.We really got a kick out of “LAIR” place because of all the small creatures you don’t normally associate with in your everyday life. We went into the “Damp Forest” which is 6,000 square feet and houses a wide variety of animals to include; the West African green mamba, Australian lungfish, Pit Viper, poison dart frogs, plus numerous others. The habitats were well constructed well and the animals appeared to be well adapted to their environments.After the LAIR we checked out the Arroyo Lagarto, which comprised of outdoor exhibits for the “California desert tortoise,” “Madagascar spider tortoise,” “Madagascar tortoise,” and the “Desert Lizards.” All the exhibits drew plenty of “Aaaaa’s and Ooooo’s!” We would go on to see the rest of the reptiles at the “Desert LAIR” which is a 2,000sq ft. secondary building which housed animals from Mexico, Arizona, and Southern California.My favorite was the $42 million 3.8 acres complex where they house different types of elephants from the Far East. We watched as we saw elephants go under a waterfall, which they were obviously enjoying on this hot day and drew large crowds.The Los Angeles Zoo has also been credited with bringing back the endangered California condor, through their successful breeding program. The species were almost extinct from a low 22 in the 1980’s to over 430 today.Moving on, we eventually took a “zoo train of sorts,” which is a long line of cabs chained together around the zoo that we wouldn’t normally see had we walked! Taking this train was a great break from “hoofing it” around this huge park.Yaa, and by the end of the day, I can honestly say, we were all pretty tired and fell asleep shortly thereafter at our hotel (Embassy Suites in Valencia California).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Holdtheair
40,Nice Day trip,"We stopped in LA to see family and wanted a place to meet up and they hadn't been to that zoo before. It was nice to be able to walk the zoo and become overtired. Plenty of animals to see. Enjoyed the chimpanzees and the koalas. Not too crowded for the first weekend in June. As a family that likes to be members in numerous zoos, this zoo did not disappoint our expectations.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mommaof5kiddos
50,Amazing Zoo,"The zoo was beautiful, very clean and had a large variety of animals. The food selection was also good; much better than I had imagined. Overall great place to take the family!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/455almas
50,Great Fun and awesome fun,My Wife and I decided to go to the LA Zoo. We booth haven't been there since we were both kids. The park is free and plenty of it. Lots of school buses loading off groups of kids. Most of the animals were wide awake but a few were lazy and sleeping. the monkeys were fun to watch as the young ones climbed up and down trees and wooden poles. We also saw a baby chimp hitching a ride on mommas back. Most of all it was a fun time and will go again with our kids. Cost 18 dollars for adults and 13 for kids If I remember right. Lots of food to eat as well trinkets to buy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hylianknight
40,"Nice setting, plenty to see",We hadn't been to the zoo forever. I talked my family into going for Fathers Day and we had a great time. There's a lot to see and most of the animals were fairly active. I like the setting as you don't feel like you are in the middle of a big city. There are plenty of places to eat and lots of shade on a hot day. Price seemed a little steep ($18) but it turned out to be worth it as everyone saw something that they enjoyed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Samndjsdad
30,Opinions on this zoo are relative,"Before going to the West Coast, we looked at the reviews for this zoo to see if we wanted to add it to the itinerary. We were somewhat concerned based on the number of negative comments regarding the upkeep of the exhibits and the happiness of the animals. However, a visit worked well with our plans and we went. I'm not sure how great the other zoos in California are, but we thought this zoo was perfectly fine for a zoo. The exhibits were about the size we've experienced in other zoos. We noted that every animal had an opportunity for shade and a watering place. The pathways had pretty flowers, trees, and greenery keeping things shaded for us. How can one tell if an animal is happy when watching it for a few minutes? In my opinion, the gorillas and chimps were showing off; I guess some could say they were angry. Besides the primates, we were also amused by the elephants who were entertaining while taking their plunges in the water. Opinions are relative to experience and interpretation, so my overall recommendation would be to see it for yourself and form your own opinions about this zoo . On another note, the admission is a little more expensive than I wanted to pay, but it was probably a better overall bargain than the San Diego Zoo. Everything for purchase within the zoo is expensive as well, but that's how most zoos operate so it was expected. We are quite content with our decision to spend a few hours here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/craigo228
30,May go again,I loved this place as a kid and wanted to take my kids to see it. It was nice but not great. We didnt like that most exhibits were closed or had not animals. And the ones that did had only one lonely animal that seems very depressed. And to top it off a few cages/exhibits had hot wires around them so the animals couldnt get out. They should just build better or bigger exhibits! The gorillas exhibit was very sad and he seemed very upset and started hitting the glass. You could hear the hot wire noises from all around the exhibit and trees.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RosemaryT587
50,Elephant Habitat Tour Behind the Scenes!,"I had the opportunity to visit the inside (restricted) area of the Asian elephant exhibit today. Specifically the large Elephant interior building. The giant iron gates inside was like a seeing a real life version of Jurassic Park. Wow! They have iron gates that slide open via a remote control electronic device.Our guides for the day were knowledgeable, prepared, and excellent. I learned a lot about these magnificent animals during our private tour. This is the home of ""Billy"" the large African male elephant, along with ""Tina"" & ""Jewel"" the female Asian elephants.I was able to see how they care for these animals, including the room that is designated for emergencies. This behind the scenes adventure was rewarding and informative.We even received a hands on display lesson on the ""brick shaped tooth"" of an elephant, including the ""wire like hair"" from the tail of an elephant. We also saw a piece of ivory that had been broken off from one of the tusks of an injured elephant.Two of these female elephants have been at this zoo since they were 4 years old (they are 50 years old now). Thanks for the wonderful lesson and tour of this awesome facility for our behemoth friends.These zoo employee professionals should be commended for their excellent tour & presentation today. It was truly outstanding!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mcclintock853
30,Nice family outing but not the best zoo I've been to,"We had a nice time, but we've been to better zoos. I would have expected a little more from a zoo in one of the largest cities in the country. As with most zoos, be prepared to walk! General parking is free and preferred parking was only $5.My favorite thing about the day was probably their new birds show. We got to see some beautiful, talented and very fast birds fly outside of cages above the crowd. It was amazing to see them in flight and follow commands. Also, I was pleasantly surprised at how good the food was at one of the restaurants, Reggie's Bistro (towards the front entrance). I had a delicious gourmet style burger and sweet potato fries.As a couple of the other reviewers mentioned, some of the animal enclosures seemed small. Also, the LAIR exhibit (reptiles) was very humid and crowded.If you have a small child, I would recommend using a Baby Bjorn, baby backpack or a stroller that is seated up high. We took our umbrella stroller that day. It was light and easy to navigate, but we spent a lot of time taking our son in & out of the stroller so he could see the exhibits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MayaD888
10,Sad :( Unhappy animals.,Small enclosures. Dirty. The majority of the animals at this zoo looked very unhappy.The flamingoos looked very distressed. The lions enclosure is the smallest I have ever seen at the tha zoos ive been too. (No room to run around) same with the tiger. Even worse is the jaguar who was in a small c shaped cage. He was pacing around and around the same route very distressed. The gorillas were not happy - 1 actually pumped its fists against the glass at us. The chimpanzees were fighting.. whilst the crowd crowded around and cheered. (Disgusting) they were very distressed and he mothers will there babies were terrified and trying to protect them. The birds were all locked up with no where to fly around. (Unatural) The park was dirty. The glass needed cleaning. There were barely any staff around the park... we saw young kids banging on glass trying to get the animals to move.. while their parents couldnt care less. There should be staff around to manage this. There is hardly any info to read about the animals. There are a lot of double ups of different animals in same enclosures. There are also double ups of the same animals in different enclosesures.. like they are trying to fill up the empty enclosures. There were a few empty enclousures around. There is no animal interaction apart from the childrens farmyard which only has goats and a horse. Very disapoonted and wont be back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jagats2014
40,Worth a visit while in Los Angeles!,"We are a bit spoiled to how good this zoo is. My daughter has a friend who works for the zoo, and we have been fortunate to receive a ""back door"" tour. It is amazing to be able to watch the animals being fed up close, see their personalities and how they interact with the caregivers. This zoo really takes care of their animals and the public should be very proud of their efforts. This trip we visited the chimpanzees, gibbons, orangutans, monkeys, rhinos, giraffes & flamingos. Wow! The zoo also has a new rainforest exhibit not to be missed. We visited on Memorial Day, it was really crowded. If you can go on other than a holiday, might be a more pleasant experience. Nice weather is also appealing for your stroll through this very nice zoo. We will return and you should too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shuttrrbug
40,Especially liked the small primates,"We were quite surprised by a pleasant and educational trip to the zoo.We were basically expecting a nice way to spend some time outside on a cool sunny day and came away impressed. Having been to zoos or wildlife parks on four continents and not having heard much about this zoo, we were expecting a much less naturalistic zoo. Amongst the surprises were the floating toys the tigers were given, the active small primates, and a really noisy asian crane. The nesting flamingos were a bit of a surprise as well, but the rat we saw in the same enclosure, clearly was the worst for wear and tear. I would guess that it and the birds were not exactly ""friends"".The zoo, however, is still an older zoo with smaller enclosure spaces, but the educational signs are good, and we did run into a staffer clearly engaged in the plight of the California Condor. The small primates were interesting and surprisingly active (They are given complex enclosures). We do wonder about seemingly missing animals, for example we saw only one orangutang, and there were several other empty exhibits.The tickets were reasonable and despite the large number of daycare children and their out of shape escorts, not really crowded. There are elevation changes here so you can expect some useful exercise in the network of enclosures arranged by global regions.Access is somewhat limited by roadwork on the Western Ave access to/from I-5S. The city should do a better job of signage, because the signs point drivers in the direction of a closed ramp and not further south through Griffith Park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ReisendeGringo
50,Animals and You,"Did you know that South American armadillos can roll up in a perfect tight ball with head and tail completing the closure?Located near the children's petting zoo and the caves, there are 3 stations with green umbrellas occupied by zoo docents who bring small animals/reptiles out for the public to touch and see. They amaze you with facts and quirks about their charges. When I was there I touched a snake, not yucky at all a bearded dragon lizard, very cute and saw the armadillo devour meal worms!The docents are very friendly and can answer direction questions, animal questions and even engage the patrons with questions, as a visitor from Peru said that the armadillos live in the high forests and are used as food for most of the native population, the docent asked this visitor many questions to learn about this animal in their native habitat. Lots of fine.The shows are 7 days a week, twice on the week days and three times on the weekends.Catch a show, I learned a lot in a few minutes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wallaceneff
30,Trip to a nice zoo,We went to this Zoo with 2- 4 year olds. Had a good time at a large zoo bigger than I thought it would be. The kids had a blast looking at all the different animals. If you are in the area of Southern California I do recommend going to San Diego zoo rather than La zoo.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Salaamus
30,nothing special here,"there is really nothing special at this zoo as far as finding unique animals here. I say this when comparing to the far better zoo located in san diego, ca. I would suggest finding a cooler day to visit this zoo because in the high heat the animals will retreat to shaded areas or seek out to hide in their shaded dens.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hoben01
50,Great !,"It was a great attraction. There are several animals, all well maintained, cared for and happy. Love animals and were very well received there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PaulaCR26
40,Good zoo!,"Although it was not the best zoo I've ever seen, but it worth a visit!! My 3-y old son loved the animals and we also enjoyed it. We were there by 11 am, visited the whole zoo, had lunch and it was still 4 pm, because it is not really big. And paying for the train is completely waste of money, it just circles you around, and since it is a really small zoo it only takes some minutes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vita_n_81

50,Worth it!,"One of my favorite zoos! My 1 year old daughter and I had a great day at the zoo, it was the perfect size. Not too big that you miss anything but not too small so you don't feel bored at the end. Exhibits are well designed so that you're very close to the animals! So far the best I've ever seen of a lion.... We were close with no glass or net separation, very cool! Try to avoid the school groups if you can.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Esayed84
50,Very well done displays - great food!,"This charming zoo is exceptionally clean, designed and well kept. Although we visited on a school vacation weekday, it never felt crowded or overly noisy. The signs are really well done and informational. From Reggie the alligator to the amazing elephant compound I learned something at every stop. It was helpful to ride on the shuttle to get an overall view then go back to favorites. Three hours was not enough for us but we tend to linger and read every sign. Having Pauley Perrett give the elephant talks was a huge plus for us - we are big fans. On the advice of Kimberly the caterer, we ate at Reggie's Cafe and had a wonderful lunch. Very fresh, well cooked and presented - it was far from the usual fastfoody zoo fare. Highlights for us - the handcarved carousel and elephant exhibit. Also interesting items in gift stores.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Conquesthistory
30,Crossed off my List,"So, I've been wanting to come here for a really long time and I finally was able to cross it off my list.So for 1 senior, 1 adult and one child (2) the total came out too $46, not too expensive but I just don't understand why charge for a 2yr old. I can understand charging kids 4 and up as they tend to understand and see more. So, it was kind of hard to find the zoo at first but when we did finally get there, I was excited.In my opinion I think this zoo,...well sucks! There's no comparison to the San Diego Zoo, which I believe is just way better in so many ways. The L.A zoo is nice but I didn't think they had many animals, snack vendors or gift shops throughout the zoo. Maybe we just went on a bad day because they were under construction in many areas of the zoo. In my opinion, you would think for what they charge, the animals would be well kept and fed. It's just sad to see some of them in their own feces and with dirty or little water to drink.All I can say is at least I came and saw and sadly for me there will be no next time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jan192
30,Underwhelming,"Unfortunately, we didn't get to see much on our visit to the LA Zoo and Botanical Garden. The majority of the exhibits were closed and for the ones that were open, the animals were hiding. We went around opening time (10am) so you probably want to try another time of day; perhaps the animals will be more active then. If they didn't advertise having a botanical garden, you wouldn't even notice it was there. The botanical garden consists of small patches of various flowers and plants spread out around the zoo. It took us about an hour to walk around the entire zoo. I did like that they have 2 gift shops and several different places to eat. We had lunch at Reggie's Bistro. The food was pretty good but pricey (as can be expected in a tourist place).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iLive4Adventuring
50,Such a great zoo,"The LA Zoo is the greatest zoo I have ever been to. It offers a large array of animals from all over the world. For what you get to see the entrance fee is nothing. We went on a rainy day and most of the animals were still out and about. This would be a great place to take your kids, or anyone who shares a love for animals!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/370ryano
30,so many exhibits closed,"It was cool but a lot was shut down. It was fun but expensive at 60 dollars for 4 people with a military discount. Food average about 40 dollars for four people, not including drinks and snacks.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Amaple27
30,long lines if you dont have a ticket in advance,always a good time at the zoo. just dont wait in the line at the entrance to buy a ticket here. the line was massive! buy in advancethe best part of the visit was seeing the monkees and hippos (O:better bring your camera and a hat here! lots of sun and walking tooHope you can see the pictures of our zoo visited i posted with this review.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tonystewart14
50,Much cheaper than Disney or Universal,"The LA Zoo is an excellent combination of entertainment and education. The new LAIR for reptiles give you an intimate look at frog, snakes and turtles. The Merry-go-round is a must see. It's the only one I have ever seen with a Komodo Dragon. It is a big zoo so be ready for a long walk. The food isn't too bad. Try the Mexican food in the South American section. Best deal is a family membership, cheaper than one adult ticket to Disneyland.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hejwall
10,Disappointing,"We purchased a LA Go Card and decided to go check this out. We have been to really fantastic zoo's, sadly, this one is at the very bottom of our list! It was very dirty everywhere! Bathrooms looked like they hadn't been cleaned in months! No staff anywhere walking around cleaning or helping customers with questions, directions or even working in the food booths. We bought a souvenir cup and I waited in line for 15 minutes to get a refill. Hard to follow the locator map. Animals had very small areas with a majority of them being alone in their cages. Most needed updated, seen rust inside the walled enclosures. The walking paths are cracking and have big holes in the areas making it a hazard. All the glass in the enclosures needed to be cleaned. Only a few animal shows or informative talks were listed in the visitors guide and they only had a few morning times listed. We rented a car a day earlier to go here and spent the whole day there. So not worth it! Had to pay extra for the tram ride which is not fair mostly because of all the hills that one has to walk up and down and for those of us not able to do that easily, you shouldn't have to pay extra for this! Take my advise, do something else, spend the time elsewhere!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EpicSpirit11
40,LA Zoo,"Just spent a lovely day there. Best to go early. Free parking really close. Food is good, abundant and decent price.Animals cool and intersting, but cats were a bit small and some reptiles not very impressive as in other zoos and the aviary was rather small; still, the gorillas and primates absolutely make up for occasional no shows and less impressive animals.If bringing children there are loads of areas and activities for them.Takes like 4 hrs without kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CristinaZ67
40,We enjoyed it.,"Whenever we make a trip to California we try to go someplace where we've never been before. This time around we chose the zoo. While it wasn't anything ""spectacular"" we still enjoyed our visit there. It was bigger than I had expected, and clean. A lot of the shops/restaurants were closed...probably because it was winter time. We got to see some really neat animals, and I was able to take some pretty good pictures.Unless you are using an electric wheelchair (with a fully charged battery) the zoo is really not wheelchair friendly. Luckily for my husband I was able to walk for a good part of our visit and he didn't have to push me up all the hills!The price was very reasonable. The zoo staff were very friendly and knowledgable. I'm glad we went and got to see the place, but I would't go out of my way to go again. It's a nice day trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NunyaBwax
50,what fun!,"pleasantly surprised how clean and tidy this is....animals are plentiful and well looked after, easy to wander around and see all the exhibits, not like the vast acreage to cover of neighbouring zoos where a lot gets missed or hard to spot.lovely morning out, plenty to do if you want to linger longer, petting zoo and picnic area for the young ones.Recommend visiting in the week, less of a crowd...the earlier the better, as we were leaving more people were accumulating.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clarej2610
40,"Pritty location, average zoo","The location and nature of the park is great. Nice to walk, a lot of shadow to prevent you for the sun. The animals are most of the time only present in small numbers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RuudS_11
20,Up hill!,"It's an OK zoo, but when we went (Dec 27th) it was seriously overcrowded. Lots of large animals in unfortunately fairly small enclosures. But it's very spread out and a serious uphill hike to where most of the animals are. I'm in a wheelchair and there is absolutely no way my wife could have pushed me up the 3/4 mile hill. Fortunately they rent Electric wheelchairs for $25 (plus a $25 deposit). The other major issue inside the zoo was there was only One handicapped bathroom and it was by the entrance (bottom of the hill). Outside the parking lots were jammed and a serious shortage of handicapped parking. When we (legally, per Federal Law) had to take two places to provide space for a wheelchair to get me out of the car, we got a parking ticket despite my blue Handicapped placard and permission from 2 parking attendants. Not trying to put a damper on anyone's visit, but if you're handicapped or even elderly, you should be aware of what you're in for.But the animals were great and the staff was friendly, so it's great if you're able bodied. If you have little kids you'll have to carry them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BruceW609
30,Nothing great,"Visited zoo in May with my wife. Zoo spread across large area. Not enough or well placed signs. Chimps habitat was good, others are just so so... Not a place to visit to explore many kinds of animals. Just a time pass in case nothing else to do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TnR_12
40,Great for families- ride the carousel!,"We brought grandpa, five kids age 8 months to 17 years and 6 moms and dads and the zoo was great for everyone.The animals were out and about and easy for everyone to see, even on a busy day.We all loved the carousel. It's beautifully painted and fun to ride. The whole place is perfect for pictures. There's even nice gift shop, a couple actually, with a good selection of educational toys and souvenirs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Julie_in_minneapolis
30,Small zoo,"Areas of this zoo are nice, and others are not. Some of the animals have large habitats to roam around (tigers, elephant, bears, chimps), while others are not so lucky (giraffes, hippo, and many others). They have a neat reptile area to check out. Hopefully there will be more to see once the construction is complete. Stay away from the zoo during the summer.. there are bees EVERYWHERE. And pack a lunch/ snacks, food options are slim and not worth the price. If you're looking for the best zoo in SoCal, skip this and opt for the San Diego Zoo.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/inspiredpanda

We went in late October and a friendly worker told us we picked a good day to come and that on weekdays its a zoo. Yes, he really said that... One thing that could use improvement is the restrooms.

50,what a nice surprise,"I would say LA ZOO lives in the San Diego shadows, but its worth visiting if you are around. In fact it was the only place we were pleasantly surprised at when in Los Angeles. Small and crowded Universal Studios and hectic and boring Hollywood Bld. were completely forgotten in here. Yes its right there are not many animal shows in here, but in my view its a big plus as you are in the ZOO not in a circus of some kind. Nice enclosures, wide choice of animals including some rare ones and nice setting made our visit memorable...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ManaPet
40,Nice afternoon at a lovely zoo,"We recently spent about 3 hours at zoo on a trip to LA. It was a beautiful day and the zoo is a great place to spend some time. It's clean and well kept, the grounds are green and lovely. The people are friendly and the animals exhibits are awesome. My daughter especially loved the LAIR, living Amphibians, Reptiles, Invertebrates house. I loved the Gorillas and Chimps, bears and hippo.

30,Its just a zoo,To be honest I have been to better Zoo's. Unfortunately LA zoo didn't really make me go wow. There was no live animal shows and it was pretty basic.They had a wide selection of animals to look at but I think the amount of stinging bees around the park was too much.They have a sign at the ticket booth mentioning bees which I only saw once I left the park to go book a taxi.

50,A At the Zoo,I love takink my two young grandsons to this Zoo! I get a great work out and they love the attractions. There are many places to sit and enjoy the animals. Lots of shade on a hot day and plenty of food if you don't bring your own. You can also rent strollers if you need for the little ones.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/linrosen2750
30,Los Angeles Zoo has alot to be desired,"Although the gorrillas and the carousel were my favorite! Without those this was a totally lame visit. Besides the heat what didn't work is that there were very few spaces of shade for the guests. The food was seriously aweful with only fried foods and junk food. No simi healthy things at all. On a good note the prices of the stuffed animals and the souvenir shops seemed reasonable, which was nice to see. If you're going to the zoo head to San Diego and have an extra-ordinary time. Even the animals didn't want to come out and say hi because of the heat I guess. Lol",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/goddess888
40,"Great Zoo, too many bees.","I've visited many zoos, but this is by far my favorite. The animals look happy, the botanical gardens are spectacular and the rhino encounter is an absolutely amazing experience. What I could do without is the large amount of bees. They're everywhere and fly right at your face. I'm allergic to bees so during our last trip we had to leave early because of the bees therefore we didn't get to see much. The bees are definitely a big problem and interfere with the enjoyment of the park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ratfd
30,Kind of disappointing,I went to the zoo on August 12th. We didnt see alot of animals because it was a little hotter that day and I guess the animals didnt care to be in the heat. But it was a great place to past some time for the day. I would go back only if the day was a little cooler and the animals are out.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/61channingf

50,A great time,"While visiting California, I took my daughter here and she LOVED this zoo. We've been to many zoos, but this one is big and her favorite part was seeing the flamingos with eggs in their nests! Plus the baby flamingo that was not yet pink. Fun exhibits and lots of things being added in. A construction worker there told me they are adding a big rainforest exhibit. Sure sounds interesting.Great zoo, and also very affordable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChristineV85
30,Bee exhibit,You may want to reconsider going if you're allergic to bees. The entire place is swarming with bees and you can sit down to eat anything without having them swarm all over you. I wasn't stung but was constantly annoyed by bees in my face!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cableape801
50,The LA Zoo,"The LA Zoo has come a long way in the last few years. Exhibits are constantly being expanded to create a more natural habitat for the animals, and this work is ongoing. The chimps, elephants, sea lions, and orangoutangs are some of the happiest zoo animals I've seen due to this and I've been to many zoos all over the world. The grounds are beautiful, an oasis of sorts. Yes, it's hilly, but think of it as a convenient work out while you are enjoying the botanical gardens, and checking out the animals. Seasonal activities like ""Snow Day"" and ""Boo at the Zoo"" offer an added treat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mariney633
50,Visit to the zoo with my grandson,First visit to the LosAngeles Zoo with my son and grandson. Beautiful surroundings and a very clean park.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeonaR978
50,A very good zoo,"It was great to re-visit LA Zoo and to see the Chimps, other Great Apes and other animals again. They all seemed well looked after and coming to see them made for another great day out. When we were in Berlin Zoo recently a sign said LA Zoo only so many thousand kilometres. It was worth the travelling!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Trevor93
40,"Tigers, Alligators and Hippos oh my!","The zoo has al of the major animals that you would want and every time we go, we encounter a tiger giving a roar, a hippo getting its teeth brushed or meeting an inquisitive bird that lands on your shoulder.The zoo isn't built on a flat surface, so be prepared to walk up and down some steep inclines at times as some parts of the park have some steep grades, but any extra effort is worth it as the LA zoo is a hidden gem away from the busy city and tucked at the other end of Griffith Park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/The_Roaming_Raven
50,Excellent Zoo,"We had a great time at the LA zoo! We have an almost 2 year old so we were only there for a few hours but had a blast. It was not too crowded and we felt like we got to see all the animals up close. We went early in the day and all the animals were active. Bring some walking shoes because like most zoos, it is a lot of walking. I would definitely recommend this to people with kids or others that enjoy zoos.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NateM_13
40,Better than in years past and still improving,"Deceided to stop by the Los Angeles Zoo on a recent trip to LA. For strters it is not teh San Diego Zoo whih is absolutely maazing, but this is a very good zoo. There are lot of animals to see and the exhibits have good explanations that are appreciated by young and old. There are a number of exhibits that are being renovated and will reopen in the next year. Also the rhino recently had a baby and is not in her area.Try to come in the afternoon around 1 or 2 to avoid the buses of school kids and camps. By 3:00 you will have the place to yourself. Defintely worth another visit. If you live in the area, an annual pass may be worth the investment, if you go twice per year you are ahead of the game.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DaraTheExplorer
50,What an amazing zoo!!!,"I travel all over visiting zoos. I've been to almost every zoo in the U.S.A!! This zoo is definitely one of the best!! They have an excellent array of animals, and a pretty knowledgeable staff too! There were some areas that were still under construction but for the most part the whole zoo was open. Definitely a great place to bring the family and spend the day! I would highly recommend this zoo to people of all ages!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ryano997
30,Average zoo,"This was average on all levels. Yes, it is huge and winding, just like LA itself, but the majority of the animals were off-runway, so we didn't see much. Also, it was a bit hard to find our way in this park, but we managed thank god.The Koalas are very cute, and quite a sight, but I would not go back to this zoo again. Also, parking is a nightmare, only the preferred spots are easy to find, but they will cost you 5 bucks.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/561d_nielf
50,Coolest animals in a family friendly atmosphere,"There aren't too many things a family can do anymore without going broke. Except for the LA Zoo!!! From grandpa to the littlest grandson, our family of nine spent a day looking at some unique and exotic animals in a cool and beautiful park. The staff always seemed to be there when we needed directions or explanations. One employee even helped us find a good place to view the elephants!! Although we did buy lemonade from zoo venders, we brought a homemade picnic lunch and snacks to eat inside the park under the shade. Not too many other attractions will allow that!! But you do have to try one of the filled churros....oh yum!! And you have to ride on the deluxe carousel featuring multiple animals, not just ponies!! Even a dung beetle family seat!! It was a great day!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NancyP776
50,A fabulous zoo... a wonderful family day.. over and over..,"I have been going to the zoo... at least 5 times a year for the past 6 years with my grandchildren...now age 11 and 6. The zoo is wonderful.. constantly changing.. so much to do...so much to learn, so much to see,,, it is a repeat and follow up site...I suggest you take the Tram to the top of the zoo and walk down... Also I suggest you plan your trip.. It is impossible to see it all.. so have fun planning your day with the kids and then... go and enjoy... again and again... See you there..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/res5137
40,UP and Coming ...World Class Zoo,"It was the one attraction we had the chance to see on our trip to Glendale and the L.A. area. We wanted to show our 5 year old something life changing.RULE #1 -""BUY YOUR TICKETS ON-LINE / AVOID THE LONG TICKET LINES""We made the ""tourist"" or visitor mistake of thinking that there would be no problem getting there at the 10 am gate opening buying tickets and getting in and seeing the park in a few hours. There were well over 100 people ahead of us at 9:45! We only had three hours we could spend before needing to get on the road for home. Instead of $46 for two adults and one child, I decided to buy the $114 tax deductible, Annual Family Membership. This avoided the 90 min wait that we were faced with in the general admission line. 10:30 am and in we go!Once you're in they take your group picture that you can buy that day, or purchase on-line later. If your traveling I'd suggest buying them later. They won't get bent in your suitcase. There are many souvenir shops just past the entrance. AVOID buying anything until later, or you will have to hold all of this stuff as you walk the park.You can choose to walk or pay extra to ride around a portion of the park. We opted to walk the main inside route. As others have said I think they need larger ""in-your-face"" signage. It was easy to lose your way as you're not there to ""walk a trail"" but to look at the animal attractions.As of May 25th, there are many old animal displays under construction and many areas of the park undergoing brand new displays. This added to the confusion finding our way. The staff that knew the park were very helpful.Food and Drinks are easy to buy from vendor’s right along the walk paths. The prices are typical of amusement parks so bring $20-$30 for these treats. We wish we had camel back packs with Iced Gatorade and P&J sandwiches. That would have been the perfect choice to save some money. We did enjoy the snow-cones. We also stopped at the back of the park for some hot dogs. This part of the park could use some help. It was ok, but not very exciting.We decided at this point that we needed to leave the park and get going on our 10 hour drive home. There were many other animal displays we did not get to see. We missed the ""LAIR"" room. We did stop and buy a couple of T-shirts and a adventure toy. The toy was $20 and very cheaply made! It broke before we had got back to our hotel!!!We don't recommend them.In summary, this was great time for us and our son. The animal displays were well cared for and for the most part easy to ""see the animals"". We could have spent at least another hour or two in the park. Our total time in the park was just two hours. I also received a Annual Membership Discount on everything we bought in the park. This help to balance out some of the extra cost to get in the park.*ARRIVAL AND PARKING ($5 per car) Time should be considered when planning a visit to the LA ZOO, it lake a long time to get in and get out of the park. The park has other events that happen at times and should be reviewed before heading out. TRAFFIC on the way out took over 60 minutes to get out of the park property on the the freeway.The LA ZOO is a good full day size park. Even with a 5 year old we made good time and were able to see most of the park before the little boy ran out of gas! We look forward to returning another time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RenoMountainFolk
10,Worst Zoo Ever!,"They don't have many animals. And the ones they do have, you can't see. Half of the Zoo is under construction. So maybe that's why it's so bad. Not sure. Maybe don't go for a few years to see if that was the issue. NO LIONS! The two tigers they did have were sleeping were you could see them. They only had the small cages with little monkeys. All the big neat animals you go to see. Where NOT There. Never saw a Hippo, Rhino. They had a Ape cage with one Ape. So the odds are all against you for seeing any of them. Horrible set up. I was warned by many people it wasn't worth going. But I figured it was only 17 dollars. But it seriously wasn't worth. It felt more like a Fair with no rides. Nothing was open. The little train area for kids looks like a ghost town. All overgrown and trash. Go to the beach instead. It was a nice hot day. I wish we just stayed home and played in the sprinklers. It was such a waste of money and the drive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bethj366
30,Nice Zoo,We love going to Zoos. First trip to LA so we had to visit the Zoo. We got to see different animals that we dont have here in South Carolina. You do have to walk alot up and down some hills and it was a very HOT day. My only complaint is the Zoo isnt marked very well. The Map doesnt really match up with where the animals are. I heard someone else complaining to an employee of the ZOO and she said some of the animals had been moved to improve their enclosure. This should be noted somewhere inside the Zoo. Some of the enclosure are so grown up you couldnt find the animals. Overall a good Zoo and it was on our Go LA card.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/716lynnb
30,nice but not as extensive as the San Diego Zoo,"We arrived a little late, spoke to the gate attendant to purchase tickets ( 4 adults, 1 child). He was kind enough to advise us before we bought the tickets that even thought he zoo closes at 5, they begin putting the animals away at 4. We returned the next day. Signage could be better to keep the flow of people moving smoothly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traveller_360063
50,Great Zoo with beautiful grounds,"The Los Angeles Zoo is a great place to spend a day. The animals are well cared for in spacious areas. The grounds are pleasing to the eye and the plants and trees make for a beautiful landscape. Young and old alike can enjoy this experience. The zoo is spacious too, so that even on a crowded day the visitor doesn't have a cramped experience. And, since the weather is beautiful year-round a day at the zoo is a safe bet 12 months a year. Most visitors to Los Angeles or Hollywood don't consider a day at the zoo, but they should! And, for those of you visiting from out-of-town the zoo is only a fifteen minute drive from the heart of Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/723Kingscroft
50,Such anamazing place,"I loved going to this zoo. It is so beautiful and the animals are amazing! When I return to Los Angeles, I am definately coming back here!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Drumaine
50,convenient,It's close...it's convenient...the animals are great. They have a nice little petting zoo. It's worth becoming a member...especially when you know it's for the animals.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Parej15
30,Where are the animals?,"My family and I went there on a Tuesday and the park is HUGE. The zoo is really nice and the animals are in large areas. The only problems is we didnt see half the animals that where supposed to be there. They were eather closed for construction, or locked in side for some reason. The food and drinks are pricy so I would sugest that you bring your own.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lisamagana
50,Pleasantly surprised,"We had not been to the LA zoo in YEARS.... I remembered it to be ugly, dirty and sad .But this Saturday we had a reason to try it out again with our grand daughter and I was very pleasantly surprised how gorgeous this zoo has become, it is like a forest with amazing trees, shrubs and plants everywhere, very lush and rain forest like, the shuttle was very nice to use as the zoo is uphill and very stretched out. We did not get to see half of what this zoo had to offer as the little one fell asleep and it was getting very hot but we will definitely return before the summer.The most wonderful thing was to see the baby giraffe . I would recommend this zoo to everybody even if the baby giraffe is no longer a baby.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MakeMyBed
30,Bring lunch.,"We Love a Zoo and as we had a bit of free time in LA we thought we would wedge this in. The Zoo is huge - allow at least 3 hours to walk the area. The majority of the animals appear to be well looked after - although some of the habitats seems a little small. My only concern was that the elephant enviroment was very bare and there was one elephant on his own - they are very social animals and his behaviour made me uncomfortable. I am used to there being a big emphasis on conservation when visiting a zoo in England - This didn't really have that. There are lots of food concessions but the price is very high so bring your own - loads of places to settle down for lunch. The setting is great - lots of shade, redwoods, catus etc - and parking is free too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fluffcatsmum
30,Lions and bears - oh my!,"Spent a very nice day, with my daughter and grandsons, yesterday at the LA Zoo.Admission is reasonable (probably because of low staffing and deferred maintenance), landscaping is very lush, grounds are OK. Trash could be picked up a bit more often.Staff, at various animal pens, were very helpful. Staff at snack bars were woefully understaffed. Long lines.Animals seemed content and well cared for.Bathrooms were horrible. Probably hadn't been maintained for a few days......really, really bad. Broken toilets, water on floors, paper and trash on the ground.Good for a quick visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Minna62
40,We're passholders,"This is a wonderful zoo, that has vastly improved over time. Now don't get me wrong, it's not the world class San Diego Zoo but it is a great zoo in its own right. They just opened up the new elephant exhibit last summer. It is a great first stop because they spread fruits and vegetables along a path that is near the viewing area and sets up nicely for some close-ups of the pachyderms. The Lair is another new exhibit that houses a nice collection of reptiles and desert insects along with a few amphibians thrown in.The gorilla exhibit has four seperate viewing areas to gather and watch. The zoo is located along a hillside, but to me it provides a healthy walk and is guaranteed to wipe out my kids for the drive home. Burn calories and get peace and quiet on the drive, sounds like all positives to me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/USCarlos
30,A Zoo in L.A.,"It really is a nice place, but it is on the side of a hill, lots of hard walking,. The animals are very fun and cool, but do not expect world class variety...this is a very cool zoo, but not a BIG one.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DantheMountainMan
20,Not worth the time...,"We are zoo freaks - so let's say we set the bar pretty high. This soon is currently being renovated - that may help a ton. Right now, it seemed like 1/3 of the exhibits were empty or temporarily closed.The zoo is poorly laid out and it's not easy to navigate. The highest point is in the back so I am glad we took the tram back there and worked our way out.Getting lunch was crazy. Understaffed is not a good enough description. Also, and this isn't the zoo's fault, but the crowd was pretty rough. I never really thought about ""zoo manners"" but now I think they exist and not many people had them. It was spring break and maybe a broader audience was attracted.Don't save the reptile exhibits for the end - the LAIR and Desert animals - they are crowded and ridiculously hot. Then when you come out, if you are leaving, it's an uphill climb in the sun. A real killer. Either skip it or get to it early.The fancy new elephant exhibit is exhausting and not worth it. To their credit, they are working hard to keep the elephants engaged. Sadly, the result for visitors is a ton of hiking with no reward. You have to check many different viewpoints only to learn the elephants are in (yet) another area. An exhausting joke.The best part: Reggie the alligator. He's near the entrance and his personal story, told on one of the signs, is terrific.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JenCarole
40,very good compared to other places like this,"As a wildlife lover I visited various zoos and aquariums during a recent trip and then I decided to visit the one that is closer to where I live to compare the quality and specially how much care they take of animals. I visited this place years ago and I could tell this time how much it has improved. There are still a few thinks I think should be improved and thats the reason I didn't rate this as an excellent, hopefully next time I will.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/937rams
50,Great family time at LA Zoo,"What a find! A bucolic oasis in the center of the City surrounded by Griffith Park. Gorgeous plantings (it's an accredited botanical garden) -- in fact we became members at my husband's suggestion so that we can go walking there anytime. Of course, the animals are delightful and we were surprised to learn of all of the conservation work being done both a the Zoo and worldwide. The clinchers for our family were free parking and the abilityTO BRING IN OUR OWN FOOD!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davitt
40,Much improved over the years,"Although residents of so. cal hadn't been to LA zoo in probably 20 years. I remembered it as a very small zoo with depressing exhibits. We stopped by for visit and I was totally surprised. The exhibits are so much nicer and natural looking. Beautiful grounds. And the whole family loved all the Spring babies!! Especially the baby monkeys in several of the exhibits. Free parking and much cheaper then San Diego Zoo. Food is expensive as it is in all theme parks and zoos. If ever in area again, will love to re-visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ksjr2007
40,Good for grandkids but a little costly,"Starting with cost on entry for 9 people a bit costly. Big interest for grandkids was Reggie the gator that had been in the news. Had his own pen, but not as big as advertised.Many exhibits, and very large terrain. Bring shoes that you can walk in.Vendors not on the cheap side. If you want munchies, stands & vendors walking, again not cheap.A lot of issues with this zoo in the news ever so often. Guess it is worth the trip every couple of years, just to see what is being done.Remember when it was free. Am certainly not broke, guess what the old zoo(now abandoned in the Park)& now the new zoo are--what the heck--make the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DrWalter
40,It's not as amazing as San Diego but Fun!,"Out of curiosity I stopped by the zoo when I lived in Los Angeles because I love to watch animals, but I just never really heard or knew anyone that went. Was very surprised how big the place was. It doesn't come to the level of the more famous zoos but it's not that expensive and it can be a nice way to entertain if you have some time that you don't have planned out. I wouldn't go to LA just for this but, it can be a nice add on to your plans. I lived about a five minute drive from there so I got a membership and would go when I had time here and there. I now live in Vegas and their Idea of a zoo is so horrible (almost inhumane) that I wish there was something even half the size.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FussyRussyLV
30,Ok experience.,"My family enjoyed spending time at the zoo. There were many kinds of animals--however, there was just a few of each kind. Some kinds had only one or two on display. Most animals seemed inactive and inert. Nevertheless, they looked well fed and well taken care of.There was only one small tank for some fish. There were very few varieties of not so many fish though.Lots of reptiles and amphibians were available at the LAIR--a new section at the zoo.One of the tram operators was really nice and friendly. He kept telling interesting stories about animals while on board. Very nice!Some of the signs may be a bit confusing, and following them could be a bit difficult to find what you're looking for. Relying on the zoo's map might be easier, though still a bit hard.Food and drinks from outside are allowed into the zoo. We did purchase some food on site though. We tried to be ok with the steep prices of the food available. The upsetting part about it was when we got cheated by a cashier at Gorilla Grill. Not only he intentionally did not give us the receipt, we found out that he cheated us by not giving us the loose changes. I found that out when I asked him for the receipt, which he'd to reprint it. I didn't want to make it a big deal and ruined our day, so I decided to just let it go. Oh, well, clearly, it was not his first time cheating like this!The tram after 3 pm got quite packed. Most people just thought the same about taking another route around the zoo by the tram. So, hopping on early might be a better idea, if you don't like a crowded tram.Tram costs just a little bit more, around $1.50-4, depending on your age, in addition to the ticket price,The zoo was a good family place. Hundreds of little toddlers and kids were at the zoo. Very cute and adorable! The zoo provides lots of kids' and family's facilities. So, enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GraceP638
30,Better for younger children maybe,"Running out of things we wanted to do at the end of our vacation, we decided to go to the zoo. After waiting in line we purchased our tickets, ok price not too expensive for a zoo. We spent about three and a half hours there, that was plenty of time for us. The lunch we had at Reggies was pretty good, pricey but tasty. A lot of the staff didn't seem to want to be there, not unfriendly but not friendly either. Unfortunately it seemed there were a lot of habitats under construction. Perhaps they should rotate better because we missed quite a bit. Pretty clean but I still prefer Toronto Zoo!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChrissyBu
40,fun,great for the whole family. food as in any theme park is pricey so if you want to save bring snacks. lots to see and do. the gardens are great. i always love to come and see them.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/188RobertT
40,Interesting,"I'd liked to visit San Diego's zoo but I didn't have enough time while I was in California but my visit to the L.A. Zoo was good, not the best. Fortunatly, I've seen some animals I'd never seen before in my life. There were a lot of renovations so some of the greatest animals were not there (like the lion). It was a very beautiful and hot day so some of those were hard to find but I saw many animals I really wanted to see.I didn't eat there so I have nothing to say about this. I think it's easy to get lost without the map.I don't know yet if I would go back, but at least it was a good day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sk8cool5
40,Better than expected,"My family and I went for the day and had a fantastic time. I had heard a lot of negative things about the LA Zoo but upon arrival found them to not be true at all. This zoo is in great shape, newly remodeled in certain places. It is a nice walk around but they also have a trolley type vehicle that will take you around but it does not stop to take pictures or anything, but does give you more info on the animals as you go by. I enjoyed the walk and so did the kids. There are food and drink areas along the way so you can rest if needed or have lunch. I was bummed they did not have a tiger when we went and my son really wanted to see one. And the elephants were not out either. But all in all it is a great zoo and a must see if your in the area. I will be returning and even got a family membership which also gives you discounts inside the park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/surgteck05
30,Good average zoo,"We spent an afternoon here during a day of driving around Griffith Park. I am not a big zoo fan, but this one was better than most we have visited. Most animals were visible if you really looked for them among the foliage, and the children were having fun searching for them. Elephants were out when we rode by in the tram, but in hiding when we walked into that area later. The chimps were entertaining, and two giraffes were walking around in their area. There were several flamingos, but the odor in their area was bad so we didn't linger.Several displays were ""under renovation"" or being newly constructed and were closed. The tram was a waste of time and money, as the exhibits are on the inside, and the tram goes around the perimeter. Map was difficult to follow. Food in the cafe was pretty good. Although advertised as ""zoo and botanical gardens"", I saw very few botanicals. The ""rose garden"" was a tree with several roses planted around it. There was a large stand of bamboo and that's about all I noticed; very disappointing if you are expecting a real botanical garden.The visit was worthwhile, but I would not go back again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaryEllenB_12
50,Excellent and Beautiful Zoo,"Liked the arrangement of both plants and animals in very creative exhibits. The zoo tram gets you around the perimeter of the park and a ""forbidden zone"", but you still have to walk through the middle of the park to see most exhibits. I got my lunch done early first thing I entered park. Was surprised by free parking (our zoo charges and there is limited street parking). Saved gift shop and attraction areas near entrance for last. Lots of photos on my page.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JulieKFrey
40,Great Zoo,"We love this zoo and have had a membership for a few years now. They are always adding new exhibits and making the zoo a friendlier place for the animals. The wide paths are in good condition and easily accessible with a stroller. There are bathrooms and food throughout the zoo with the exception of the very back of the zoo or you can bring your own food, we usually do. I never make it through the whole zoo in one day. There is a playground for kids to burn off steam and the carousel if beautiful. The tram is helpful for those with mobility issues, but most should be able to handle the walking in comfortable shoes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shoshanaz18
30,San Diego Zoo it is Not,"This is a good average zoo, but derive 2 hours south for a world class, top notch zoo in San Diego. Nothing beats the upgrades, new habitats and pandas.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LoisB910
30,"Some good, some not so...","This covers a large site and has quite an interesting layout. There are a few areas under (re)development or closed off. Not much in the way of botanical gardens - more just a zoo, and still a bit too much of an old-style one at that. However, there are some places where they are doing well and have quite a few ""babies"", and they *are* trying to improve the environment and the wellbeing of the animals. Hopefully the changes they are making will lead to further improvements in future and make it more the way zoos need to be - educational, assisting in the survival of species, and not just somewhere to gawp. We spent nearly 5hrs there walking round everywhere - the map is vital to make sure you don't miss anything.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GremAndTabs
30,Zoo a little bland,I thought this zoo was behind the times in the animal enclosures. the Poor cheetah looks trapped in its little cage. Looks like it could use an upgrade.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AzTravel3
40,Enjoyable afternoon,"We spent an afternoon here at and it was quite enjoyable. The construction wasnt much of a nusance but a few of the exhibits were closed. The park is somewhat hard to navigate, better signage would be nice. This is definitly not something I would plan into a vacation but being a local it was a good day. I was surprised at the amount of trash on the ground. If they cleaned the place up it has the potential to be great. I look forward to returning when all of the construction is done.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Justanothertraveling
30,Some high points but mostly rundown,"Ill admit first to not being a huge fan of zoos having had the privilege to safari in Botswana, Costa Rica, Bolivia, etc. and could not help but feel this zoos animals could have better lives, thru better enclosures with more realistic and interesting designs. Many areas are showing signs of wear and the need for more financial support. The orangutans seemed happiest and best kept of the primates. Many exhibits were closed for repair. Very little to impress.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PaulK29
40,great zoo,"it has a great animal display. Try not to go on a very hot day, because even the animals want to get away from the sun and heat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/famfavtravels
30,Better signage would help,"Because the site is hilly and animals naturally require various amounts of habitat, the layout of the park is quite complicated. Using the map constantly, I seldom knew where my grandson and I were on the map. We walked and walked to displays that were closed, and we never found the birds that he wanted to see. Food service was reasonably good, with different types of food in different areas. We had a good time, but it could have been much better.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ax369
10,Terrible,"Many of the zoo exhibits were closed or under construction, but they don't advise you of this before you pay and enter. Many animals were hiding in their caves to stay warm, so you couldn't see them. At the highly advertised gorilla exhibit, ther was one gorilla sitting with it's back toward the spectators. The gang bangers and cholos were the only interesting animals we saw at this zoo. Should charge the zoo animals to watch the humans! The worst zoo I've ever been to.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ST563
40,Loved the zoo,"Lots to see, a lot of walking involved but worth it. Must see for kids of all ages. Was a little disappointed in the elephants, only saw 2 and they were far away. Otherwise, a great day at the zoo!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/popcrnluvr
40,A lovely zoo,"It's not San Diego, but it is a charming and well-landscaped zoo. I visit at least twice a year and there are always new exhibits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnitaA539
50,"Not World Class, but definitely nice.","I pretty much love all Zoos. LA is no exception, good variety of animals, nice exhibits, a bit on the small side though for walking space.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Erik4Travel
40,showing its age but still a fine zoo.,"The LA Zoo is a good size city zoo in beautiful Griffith Park. It is built on a slope and thus a bit of a climb but nothing your average 6 year old on a cotton candy sugar high cant handle, Grandma may need the shuttle to the top then work her way down. This is a large zoo and with lots of interesting animals to see. Some of the enclosures are a bit dated but the Zoo is in the process of up grading.Come early as the crowds grow during the day, also any good zoo goer will tell you the animals are most active early in the morning.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oldensign
50,Great to see native animals,"As a visitor with pre-schoolers it was great to go somewhere to see many native animals, reptiles and amphibians from California. We all learned a lot that day.Great exhibits and the staff was so knowledgeable. At the Elephants of Asia the guide was so good at answering all the questions of my preschoolers as they were trying to learn about the elephants.We spent a morning and I arrived when the zoo opened so it was quiet and got busier as the day went on as well as hotter.Lots to see and do as well as hands on experinces are plenty.Great reciprical program with other zoos so the cost of entry was really reasonable. Good value for money",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/triotrois
40,Well worth the visit,The LA Zoo is a great place to spend the day and offers great displays of a wide variety of animals in a nice setting. It is a wonderful place to walk from enclosure to enclosure and feel like you're out in the country. The zoo also offers a variety of educational programs for people of all ages.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/buffalojim67
40,Great Value,Cheaper than going to a movie! The LA Zoo is fun and a great value. Easy parking too. Centrally located as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AliceStyleGuy
50,A great place for kids of all ages,"The Los Angeles Zoo is an enjoyable place to spend a day. There are many animals to see and exhibits like, ""Elephants of Asia,"" ""Gorilla Reserve,"" and if you are into it, ""The LAIR"" (Living Amphibians Invertebrates Reptiles). Every corner of the zoo has something to see. There is even a carousel that the kids will enjoy (cost is $3 a ride, goes to zoo programs and projects). The carousel doesn't have horses, but features animals like bears, monkeys and even a praying mantis and bald eagle. The music is also not typical of a carousel, you will hear tunes from the 60's - 80's (Air Supply, Carpenters, Jeffrey Osborne, Simple Minds, etc). Compared to other zoos the price is not bad. There is free parking, and the food is good for the price. NOTE: if you are coming here on a weekend or a holiday, arrive early (10 - 11 am) as ticket lines tend to get long and parking lot gets full.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GerryD813

50,You know for what it is it's 5 star,"Okay, no it's not the San Diego Zoo or even the Columbus Zoo, it's the LA Zoo, and i liked it. :0) Was a lot of fun, got to see a lot of animals. It's a zoo in progress still building on, though it's been here since 1966. Easy routing for your park walk makes for a comfortable time... nothing worse than routing at a park that makes it hard to figure out what to miss or how to back track. Was pretty packed on this particular sunday, but get their early it's worth it, and nice to have an upfront parking spot. Personally, i think the LA Zoo has one of the best entrances around, love the design. One other thing that i hadn't seen before was the number of eating stops, with a variety of food, and even kettle corn with samples and Roasted almonds. Was a highly recommended good day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/northernk

10,yuk,"last time I was there, I saw a dingo in an indoor enclosure. there was a path beatin' along its perimeter. This poor animal did nothing but go in circles all day ...indoors.

40,Worth a few hours,"While certainly not the most impressive zoo, the layout is easy to walk and most of the animals are easily seen. They are proud of the elephant exhibit, but it is way too big to see any elephants very well. Be sure to check out the monkeys and orangutangs - they are the best by far.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ExperiencedTravelers

10,LA Zoo or Animal Prison,"I have been to zoo's all over America but the LA zoo isn't much , the enclosure for there elephants is deffinately way to small as were most of the other enclosures , after that i never went back , i just felt sorry for these majestic animals forced to live out there lives in such small spaces , if the can't provide proper conditions for ofter rare and endangered animals it shouldn't exist at all .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aprildoornbos

40,Forgotten zoo,"The San Diego zoo is so famous that the LA zoo is overlooked. It also has lovely gardens, spacious exclosures, and a wide variety of animals. There can be crowds in the closest areas, but you can have a remote nature walk if you get to the far reaches of the zoo.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MargieLA
40,Takes a Full Day,Allow a full day to see this zoo. Thank God the trees were mature as it was 105 degrees the day we visited and we needed that shade. It takes a lot of walking to see the whole zoo. Most of the exhibits were well done and we were able to see most of the animals. The aviary could have been more active with more birds. The elephants were enclosed by a pole and wire system that immediately reminded me of Jurassic Park. They had a nice gift shop for the shoppers like my wife. I enjoyed the day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kenbU4479GL
50,Had plenty of fun visiting,Well I just wanted to say that visiting the La. Zoo was very interesting and the Zoo is a neat as well as a nice place to go and see all the animals it has been around for a long time but it still looks really nice and they do a good job keeping up the Zoo in good shape. Also I really enjoyed seeing all the animals and it was a neat as well as a great day to see all the animals and enjoy the atmosphere of the Zoo. All in all my friend and I had a wonderful time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/happyjeff56
50,Visit Nature,"This zoo replaced an earlier zoo in the late sixties, but it's not old. In recent years, several new large areas have opened where smaller cages once stood. One recent addition is a new reptile area. In the late nineties, the zoo began to emphasize it's large collection of plants and trees and so it added 'Botanical Gardens"" to its name. The site is large and sometimes hilly as it lies at the edge of Griffith Park. A tram is available. If possible, arrive early when more animals are active. The Autry Museum is across the parking lot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KennethL828
40,Children Love It!,We went with my daughters class on a field trip and the whole class had a great learning experience. Learning about wild exotic animals and seeing them live is two different experiences every child should get a chance to see the creatures that inhabit the earth with humans even though they are in zoo's like prisoners an observation made by my daughter,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Queenubi
50,I Love it so much we have a family membership :),"I've been coming to the LA Zoo my whole life & it just keeps getting better! Our family buys each other family memberships as Holiday gifts which is the best gift ever! You get to spend quality time with your family, or you friends or a loved one. You get to see nature up close and personal, especially with the new exhibits; The elephants, The L.I.A.R., The Gorillas...Then you have so many animals and other fun things to enjoy from babies animals in the nursery, shows for the kids with activities, beautiful plant life throughout the park, so many animals and fun events! The LA Zoo is a must see in LA. and the best times to go is in the cooler months. Don't forget to get your picture taken at the front they now have a website to share & order pictures. My family loves going, we do short meaningful trips to enjoy and learn about certain animals on certain days. We've also gone to Music in the Park which is at night and an awesome event! Check the website for info then check out the LA Zoo :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MsGoodenough
40,Groooooowl,Wildlife in Los Angeles other than coyotes and squirrels and crazy people? Are you kidding me that's fantastic and so regardless of its less than desirable upkeep compared to neighboring San Diego zoo it is still enviable that we at least have a place to go!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlobalGoneLocal
50,Anniversary Date,"Went to the LA Zoo on our anniversary and had a great time. The only bummer was it was HOT! The air conditioned Reptile Buildings were definitely popular....lol! I had not been to the LA Zoo in quite some time but found it to be much more doable in a day as opposed to the San Diego Zoo which is much larger. We went during the week and it was not crowded at all. Got to see Billie the Asian Male Elephant, do some water aerobics with the staff and that was a blast! Wish they had an elevated platform for better viewing. The staff was very friendly and answered all of our questions. Of course with the weather being so warm, a lot of the animals were hiding in the shade but you could see most of them. Evelyn, the gorilla, was my wife's favorite!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/486JohnG
20,disappointed,"First of all I understand with the SD zoo and Disney etc. right down the road it would be hard to compete. Secondly, I see a lot of construction like the rainforest and newer exhibits recently finished like the LAIR so maybe they are going in the right direction, BUT wow one would think with all the money in LA from movie stars, major cooperations, etc. that this place could raise some money for some new exhibits. It has a very good animal collection, but It looks like this place hasnt done much to a majority of the zoo since the 60's. I feel horrible for the animals and I have never seen such horrible grotoes and wire cages, time to get into the 21st century LA zoo. The place was also very dirty. Raise some money and get this place up to a world class zoo like one would expect in a city like LA. Its LA there is a ton of millionares to hit for donations!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zoofan77
30,Happy to see the construction.,"I couldn't help but feel for some of the animals here, the elephants in particular were obviously in distress. However, there is a lot of construction happening, and I think this zoo has the potential to be world class like SD Zoo. The staff were all wonderful, and it is a beautiful place..can't wait to see it when it's finished!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Linda24
40,nice zoo,we decided to visit LA zoo as we'd been to San diego a few times and wanted a smaller/easier to get around zoo day out.Enjoyed the day here. Seen a good few animals.There is a zoo train that stops at various points around the zoo. We used it to stop off at a play area for a break from walking in the heat.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AndrayaD
40,Must See Zoo in LA,"Nice entry, Cooperative Staff...Must see Zoo when you visit LA. Most tour operator take the visit. But City tours should also be inclded.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kamleshsh
20,Visiting the Los Angeles Zoo,"All I can say is I never felt so bad for so many animals at once. They looked alone and bored. There was no real ""education"" for people looking at the animals. It seemed the Zoo was more focused on gettting people to eat overpriced food. I can only imagine what the animals thought smelling the food and visitors. The focus should be the animals, not the money and food. The signage was horrible. We paid extra for the shuttle, then could not find one around after the initial trip. The elephants especially should have had bigger quarters and were bored looking. I know they and the big cats and monkeys must have larger territories and it was obvious. Human prisoners have more activities, etc. These animals did nothing wrong and are surrounded by wire for our convenience. The Orangatan was reaching outside his habitat trying to get either extra food or a weapon for something.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/uconngirl84
20,Nothing to See,"There were very few things to see. About a 1/4 of the exhibits had no animals in it at all, another 1/2 had one or two of the particular species. They had a nice new exhibit for the elephants but the animals were so far way, it was hard to see with the naked eye. I will not be returning. Would rather take the day and drive 2 hours to go to San Diego Zoo.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hoonieskang

40,Visit an old but new zoo,"So I haven't been to the zoo for a long time.  It was great to return and see the changes they did.  Which they did a lot of changes!  But I have to be honest.. What's up with the front gate?  When I saw it I couldn't help but to think of the gates to king kong!  Look at it.. It's huge with wires and a thick wall.  I swore drums were about to start playing and a woman was going to be chained to the door.But let's get back to the zoo.  I liked the changes they did to the zoo.  They are starting to put some personality to the places.  Even though I still feel its lacking.  But I like the new look they added with the cave section, the reptile liar and the elephant habitat. Now it's doesn't feel so caged animal but get a feeling of where they suppose to be.  Now we kind of get what their habitat would be like.  So big plus on that!With that said.. I noticed that the information post were not so informative.  I miss the info about the animal and what they do, what they eat, etc..Another disappointment were the trash!  I know the Zoos budget was cut but I don't think that means they can leave the place a mess.  Trash cans were over flowing, bench area was covered with trash, lots of things didn't work with scratched graffiti on it.  Just made the place look dirty!  Oh beware of the lady security guard!  When they are closed, she'll make sure you know it.  She won't have a ca in the world but to get you out of there.  ""but I just want to take photo with..."" ""get out!""One more thing.... No fresh popcorn...prepackaged..bummer!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CuriousRoads
40,"Busy, hot and pricey, but good otherwise.","Large and tropical zoo. We visit a zoo everytime we go to a new place, if there's one within 40 minutes, and love a lush, island environment with large restaurants and lots of different species to support and enjoy. This one had that feel going for it except that it was a bit cramped in lots of areas on a busy Sunday and while having loads of animals, had low numbers of them (like only 2 giraffes, one lonely otter, etc.), and the eating establishments lacked imagination,. Of course, pricey and we picked a terribly HOT day and decided to leave after doing nearly half of it and we're in our 30's and 40's! Not the zoo's fault of course. Would revisit on a cooler, less busy day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/djz032070
40,Not so big,"Can't compare to SD Zoo or Safari, but a good destination if you have 3-4 hours to spare in LA and you are not visiting SD Zoo.Get a brochure from a hotel for a discount of $2/adult and $1/kid.Parking is very limited. Try to finish the zoo by 4pm. Although it closes at 5, lots of the animals are put back to cages by 4pm.Take the tram to the top of the zoo for easier walk down the zoo to see the exhibits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CowboysIndo
40,Fun at the Zoo,The monkeys and the Gorillas are always entertaining when they are moving about. And hearing the lion roar was a treat…don’t hear that too often. The hippopotamus went to the bathroom in the water…that was funny.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MauiOceanfront

40,Zoo was pretty good,No complaints from my end. Overall the zoo was good. We did a lot of walking and saw several creatures. There was a lot of remodeling going on but in my opinion sometimes it is necessary for improvement of the zoo. The staff was very informative about their creatures,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ErickS15
20,A disappointment...,"I see plenty of positive reviews on the LA Zoo, but my experience was not so great. I spent a few hours at the zoo before I gave up trying to see animals. Many of the exhibits were ""closed for renovation"" or just plain closed, and of the ones that weren't, I saw very few living things. I'm sure they were hiding to keep cool, but we saw SO few that we joked about the possibility that there may not be any animals at all! I can't smell, but those with me complained of a horrible ""dead animal"" stench a few times during our visit. I witnessed dead fish carcasses in some of the waters. There were pools for the water mammals (like the seals) that were completely dry. And yes, there is a LOT of construction going on. It was just bad enough that the whole group decided to leave. On the positive side, there were not many people there, so if you're looking for a place to just hang out and get a good walk in, I'd say it's a great place to do that!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cmarret

40,What a fun place...,"The Los Angeles Zoo doesn't get as much publicity as others, but I found it to be very enjoyable. It's not only full of nicely displayed animals, but it's also a beautiful botanical environment. There is a beautiful new carousel with many animals from the zoo represented, but the best surprise of all is the new reptile house. You can observe many different species, and all are in attractive enclosures. I also loved seeing the two new tiger cubs romp around in the water feature. It's a great place for kids, and there are busloads on most weekdays. Seeing animals through their eyes is always fun. If you are a local resident and haven't been for a while, make the effort, you won't be disappointed. If you are from out of town, it's also a great family get-a-way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaele55
30,It's not the San Diego Zoo,"There seems to be a lot of construction going on here. Obviously, this facility has seen better days. Lots of empty enclosures and some that were housing animals seemed unclean.The animals we saw just did not seem to be content(more unhappy, if anything). It is however, a nice walk, being located in Griffith Park. We went during the afternoon on a weeday and the crowds were not too terrible and we did manage to see most of the place during that time. Get yourself a discount coupon to make the admission more reasonable. Ours was 18. per head. Be aware that the concession prices are criminal(3.75 for a very SMALL soft serve). There is ample parking on the premises(at no charge). If you want to stay local, this is a decent afternoon out, otherwise you get a far better value in San Diego",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/raff622

10,"Not a lot of animals to see, very crowded and expensive","We love zoos but this was our least favorite and probably least enjoyable experience in LA. In fairness, we went on Memorial Day and maybe if we had gone on a less busy day we would have had a better experience. It was so crowded that we could barely see the few animals that were there. The line to get into the reptile house was very long and the elephants were not out which from the signs these seemed like the 2 best attractions, oh well. Most animals were in small spaces/cages and weren't very active given that it was pretty warm out. Adding to our frustration, the map was hard to read and there weren't a lot of helpful signs posted so we kept getting lost and wandering on to the path where the tram stops and then just having to double back. Overall, we did not feel like it was worth it the long line we waited in to get in and the $16 admission.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/skupie
20,"Hard to see animals, pricey","Lots of construction going on in May 2012. I understand zoos want to make nice habitats for animals, but this defeats the purpose of a zoo.

40,A very good zoo,"A lot of care has been given to allow the animals to have at least a little bit of a 'natural' habitat. Granted, with modern communications & Hi-Difinition television, the need to display animals is not as important as it once was. However, with their natural habitats disappearing more and more, zoos have now become more like 'nature preserves' to protect and sustain many species that might otherwise become extinct. The L.A. Zoo has spent a lot of time & money to make the animals feel as comfortable as possible. Even the nocturnal Koala Bears from Australia have artifical nightime in their building, allowing us humans to see them bopping around as they naturally would. And when the zoo closes at night, the Koalas get an artifical sunlight in their building, so they can sleep. How cool is that?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RalphK507

30,My visit to L.A. and attractions,"We flew to L.A. two weeks ago . The plane ride was great . Things we went to were the L.A. zoo , The Queen Mary Ship , The Aquarium of the Pacific . I will keep each topic short in explanation . The Zoo was a nice visit but you couldn't find a lot of the animals that were supposed to be there . Maybe they only had one of each animal of the ones we couldn't see . I like the Philly Zoo much better .The Queen Mary Ship is supposed to be Haunted and we paid for the Haunted tour ( not scary at all ) Top side of the ship they were filming a movie so that day we were inhibited from moving around . The ship tour was still interesting but We were still disappointed .The Aquarium of The Pacific was a very nice Aquarium because of the hands on exhibits . we actually got touch Stingrays and Jelly fish and Sharks . There were many other hands on to touch as well .That was cool ! The way they have the Aquarium set up to see the fish is Okay but I have seen much better than this one .The prices for any of these Attractions wasn't expensive but look for coupons or deals on the net if you are going to go . We got a deal on the Ship and Aquarium package and here is a parking tip for you . Go to the Queen Mary first and pay for parking when finished take the free bus to the Aquarium ( the same free bus will bring you back) save the parking fee at the aquarium .I was visiting my Son and his family in the L.A. area that is why We went . I wouldn't go to L.A . just to see these Attractions but if you are in the area anyway just give yourselves a treat .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Spaydman

The bear came out of his cave and wandered around his enclosure just as we got there. We also enjoyed the tiger cubs, giraffes, gorillas, orangutans, chimps, elephants and countless other animals. We took the tram up to the highest point and walked down as my sister has some difficulty walking.(additional charge). My grandson enjoyed brushing the goats in the petting zoo. We had lunch at one of the many food vendors and it was good. The new reptile house had a long line , so we will come back on a weekday to see that. There is also a beautiful new carousel. The plants are beautiful too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bakeries
30,An average zoo overall with a few highlights,"Vitsited LA Zoo for first time last week. Overall, it is an average zoo. Lots of species and all of the animals look to be in good health. But none of the exhibits really made me go, ""Wow!"".Highlights: the new LAIR (reptile bldg) is quite nice - one of best in US. Children's zoo is also quite good. The Francoise langars, chimps, gorillas, orangs and koalas all had nice habitats. The grounds were clean and the walkways were wide so it never felt really crowded on a busy day.Lowlights: Most exhibits were small and somewhat sterile. Looks like a municipal zoo. The new $42 million dollar Asian elephant area was a particular disappointment. Although it takes up a lot of space, the yard was all subdivided with fencing that made it look kind of ""jail-like"". I just thought it was pretty ugly which is surprising given how much they spent on it. The graphics were good, though. I enjoyed reading about their elephant keepers. Elephant barn looked nice from outside but who knows since the public cannot go in.They are building a new rainforest exhibit. Hope they create more natural looking habitats in this area so it doesn't turn out like the elephant exhibit.Overall, it is an average zoo. It I lived in LA, I might go every year or so because I like zoos. But I don't think it is special or unique enough to warrant a special trip if you are visiting LA and don't have small kids to entertain.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mickeyway
50,Most of the construction is finally done.,"The new ""LAIR"" or Reptile House is top notch. Long overdue, but finally here. You don't have to even like them, but you will appreciate this World Class exhibit. All the construction around the main exhibits is done. This often times prevented me from visiting, because so much was closed. The food is also greatly improved with different flairs to it. Great way to get some exercise and fresh air at the same time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/boanut
40,Great small zoo and good value - free parking and easy access!,"We bought our kids and grandkids season passes and added ourselves into the deluxe package. Just redeemed them in February and had a great time. It is nice that the zoo is just off the freeway with easy parking and extra nice that it is free. The exhibits were clean and well cared for and the animals seem very ""up close"" all our grandkids are under the age of 5 and loved it. Not so big that you can't walk the whole thing in a few hours. Ramps are everywhere along with steps so very easy to navigate with a stroller.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/levisgaulin
40,Get a membership & avoid long ticket line! It's tax deductible,"My hubby, 2 y.o. daughter, and I decided at the last minute to go to the LA Zoo this past Saturday to enjoy the beautiful weather. We were definitely not the only ones who had this thought! We arrived around 1:30 and the parking lot was packed!! And the line to purchase tickets was super long! I waited in that line for about 10-15 minutes and had gotten about halfway to the front when we decided that we would just get the annual membership ($99 for the family); we were able to just walk right in without any wait! I figured it's a good thing to support the zoo as I do want it to stay open and the membership fee is tax deductible! FYI, children 2 and over are not free; we would have paid ($16 x2 for the adult tix and $11 for my daughter for just a 1 day admission). I do not think regualr admission tix are tax deductible.We only stayed a couple hours as my daughter wasn't really all that excited to see the animals; I think she is probably a bit young to appreciate it. I think she may enjoy it more in 6 months. But, I have no regrets as it was still a nice way to enjoy an afternoon with the family. It's a nice family friendly place to walk around; there were tons of families with young kids!Word of caution: we went to see the bird show, I think it was called, ""The World of Birds Show"". It didn't bother my daughter, but it did bother some other kids that the birds flew right over our heads and sometimes came rather close to the audience. My daugher is not easily phased; so if your child is on the sensitive side, you might want to sit near the exit in case you need to leave early.Another bit of advice: the food there is rather pricey (paid $15 for 2 hot dogs, fries, and 1 soda---this was with the 10% discount for members!). The fries were pretty decent, but the hot dogs were only mediocre in my opinion; so you may want to bring food from home.I would recommend visiting the LA Zoo if you are a family with young kids (or don't mind young kids), but plan to arrive in the morning!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Digoryk
50,Yes - it was an EXCELLENT EXPERIENCE!,"I had personnaly never experienced a venue like this one before. It was well landscaped, well documented, and completely intriguing. I hope to return in the near future, whenever we have out-of-town guests with us.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amercorp
50,One of the best days of our trip!,"We had such a great day here. The zoo is set out really well with plenty of trees and shady areas to escape the sun. There are water fountains throughout the park too to keep the kids hydrated whilst running about in their excitement.There are plenty of animals to see as you would expect, but its the atmosphere of the zoo that really sets it apart.The price too is very reasonable, especially if you combine it with Aquarium of the Pacific tickets using the offer via the website - which is another great day out!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Markybritt

30,Great way to spend with the family,"I recently returned to the LA Zoo after not going for over 20 years and was pleasantly surprised at all of the changes that have occurred for the better. My wife, son and I had a great time looking at all of the animals, and the food was not terrible. The only thing that I would have to say that is a negative is the patrons that come to enjoy the zoo. I know that it is a public venue and am glad to see that families of all socioeconomic backgrounds are able to enjoy the facilities, but there seems to be an immense amount of gang members that come to the zoo. It seemed that we would turn a corner and there would be a group of gangsters cursing and looking hard. Really, it’s a zoo. Try to enjoy the fresh air and learn about some animals instead of giving every body that passes by you a look.It is a great place that seems to be trying to update and expand as much as they can. We will be coming back more often. Probably during the week in order to avoid certain crowds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/365LV
30,"Good, not great...","Went back today for the first time in years.On the negative side, there was a long line for tickets and even though there were about a dozen ticket windows, only two were open. A bit inexplicable considering this is the 2nd day that the new reptile exhibit has been open which the zoo has been advertising everywhere, so you'd think they'd be expecting some big crowds. Either they weren't, or they don't care about the length of the line.The enclosures are mostly on the small side. For the most part this is ok, any larger and the animals would be able to roam too far away to really be able to appreciate.The main point of my visit was to use my new camera to take pictures of the animals. For this purpose the zoo is only so-so. Lots of shade is available to the animals, and I can't blame them but they were mostly taking full advantage of it. Good for them, but bad for photo opportunities. In other cases the enclosures are obscured by chain link, wire mesh, netting, bamboo poles or just plain poor sight lines.I didn't find the layout to be self-explanatory. Trying to wander around without using the provided map (as I was holding a camera) , I felt like there were branching pathways everywhere, making it easy to get disoriented and easy to lose track of where you've been and where you haven;t.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MachThree

30,Good not great.,"We have a membership to the Zoo as it is inexpensive and allows us to go whenever we want and stay as long as we want. The Zoo is not large, but has plenty of animals to entertain the little ones. Its not as grand as the San Diego Zoo, but they are making improvements to it each year. There is a new Elephant exhibit that openned up in 2011 and the new Reptile house is openning up in March 2012. The are also doing some sort of rainforest habitat but not sure when that will open. Some of the exhibits look old and need updating. They have picnic areas all around so if you bring your own food you can just sit down and enjoy. I love taking my Son here and he loves seeing the gorillas, elephants and monkeys. They have an elephant and keeper talk at 11AM where the elephants are brought up really close and the keepers do their daily checks with them and talk to you about it. There is a bird show and sometimes there will be some small animal exhibits around the zoo where you can get up close and personal. Overall its a nice zoo in an awesome city park and they are making improvements to it each year.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thematrix
30,Good- not Great- Family Attraction,"This was fairly large but not as large as the Bronx Zoo or as beautiful as the San Diego Zoo. Set on a hillside, it has a wide variety of interesting animals from across the world (a great many from Africa). The zoo also has food and gift shops, a picnic area carousel and a Safari Shuttle. Nice but a bit worn from heavy use.At the present time the zoo is undergoing some renovations that will be completed later in 2012.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RoyM1336
40,Suprisingly Nice,"We were visiting some friends in the LA area and decided to visit the LA Zoo. I found it to be laid out very nicely. It was a cool and overcast day so the animals were very active. There were also quite a few ""babies"" which were very fun to watch. I really enjoyed the mama tiger interacting with her babies. The reptile exhibit was under construction and is due to open this spring. It looks like it will be a very nice exhibit even though I am not a big fan of reptiles. They are also working on a Rain Forest exhibit which looks like it will be quite impressive. If you like zoos I would highly recommend this as a place to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bibrico
40,A smaller but very nice Zoo.,"Growing up going to the San Diego Zoo. I was pleasently surprised with the LA Zoo. Pretty good value. Great excercise. But beware. The entire Zoo sits on the side of a hill. Free parking if I remember correctly. But the food offered inside the park is AWFUL and VERY,VERY EXPENSIVE !!!!!!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/otev915
40,A good local zoo,"If you've been to the San Diego Zoo, you'll most likely be disappointed, but for the average zoo, it's very good.

30,Los Angeles Zoo & Botanical Gardens,"After going there 4 times I give up. There are only a few good exhibits, most of the time the animals are either hiding or sleeping.

Tons of view (on a clear day), see where James Dean threw his revolver, hike, snack and just enjoy the observatory programs and displays. Great to include in a half day tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WRR8

I was fortunate enough to go behind the scenes and see the work they do breeding and rereleasing endangered species and it is amazing. I know personally how hard it is to breed animals when they are so rare their is nearly no information and they do a better job then any of the dozens of zoos I've visited. Even as a city run program the employees are not the stereotypical ""city employee"", they really care about what they do, and their amount of education (many graduate degrees) is outstanding.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mommymiad
40,A great trip for the family,"My husband and I recently decided to invest in a zoo membership. Admission is about $16. At $99 you get unlimited visits through the year, for two adults and all of the children in our family, two additional admission tickets, and 10% off on all food and souvenir shops at the zoo.The zoo itself has made some tremendous improvements between the Elephants of Asia exhibit, and gorilla reserve to the chimpanzee enclave. While other areas of the zoo are more dated and in the midst of renovations, it is still a great place for the kids. There are a family of giraffes and plenty of other animals that your children will enjoy observing.There are plenty of food shops throughout the zoo but I recommend the Bistro at the entrance. They have the best menu of all of the eateries.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LA_tao
40,Nice place to visit with kids and family,"I went there with my husband in January and we enjoyed it a lot. I think this is also a good place to go with kids if you have ones. All the animals are there - even more than expected and the ticket price is fine, 16$ for an adult. I have not seen the San Diego zoo which is most often compared to this one, but I will surely recommend to go to LA Zoo if you are fond of elephants, giraffes, flamingos, bears, chimpanzees and many other animals that you can see there. The only negative to mention was the ""smell"" of the animals/cages , but I think of it as normal, that is how most of the zoos and circuses smelled in my life;)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LucySonyan

50,GO BACK !!!! This place is like a new zoo ! JUst as good as San Diego,I went about 5 years ago and it was very run down. My mom was in town and wanted to go to a zoo so we went to to the LA Zoo because I didnt want to drive 2 hours to SD. I am so glad we went . The place is 100% new. SO clean !!! I was so impressed that we bought a membership. The only negative thing is the long walk everywhere. My mom is older so it was a little tough on her,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lb33wonka
40,Its a better than average zoo but cannot beat San Diego zoo,"If you are in Los Angeles, this Zoo is better than Orange County Zoo. It is larger with more animals. I loved there bird show. However, it lacks the veriety of animals and activities that San Diego zoo offers. I recommend it if you dont want to drive far.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seharmd

30,Not sure what the big hype is,"It's not that great of a zoo (especially compared to San Diego). I guess people haven't experienced other great zoo's out there. Half the zoo is under construction right now. The exhibits that were open, many of them had the animals pulled out (the animals weren't hidding, they were missing). The place wasn't well kept for, very dirty, garbage wherever you went. The children's play park smelled like human fecal matter. The park is about 1/4 the size of the San Diego park. I'll continue to go there from now on.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/onecrazyfoo4u11
30,Beautiful flowers. The animals need more room.,"Expensive admission price. Also, if you are handicapped you have to pay $25.00 for an electric cart. I think that is a little high. The animals are in nice surroundings but too small for some of them. The giraffes walk back and forth in a deadman walking coma. They really need more room. Sad to watch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PaVistor19460
50,Beautiful connection with nature in the heart of Los Angeles,"This is a fantastic Zoo, with a wonderful collection of animals and incredibly beautiful grounds. You can bring in your own food, which saves a fortune, and you can stay all day. Buying a membership is a real deal. Free parking. Go first thing in the morning, when the animals are first coming out and are fresh and lively.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davitt
30,Room for improvement,"""Everything is bigger in America"". That's what we had in mind when we went to the zoo. After a one hour long busride, we arrived at the zoo. It was a blazing hot summer day, and the qeue seemed endless. When we got in we went straight to the bathrooms, which were very clean.We were just a wee bit disappointed. We walked a lot, but saw few animals (too many birds and pigs of all kinds). We didn't see the rhino, nor the tigers. Some animals were in old and small cages. It seems like they invested more money in places to eat and drink than in the animals.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PoisonedIvy
40,"Mesmerizing Monkeys, Kool Koalas, Gentle Giraffes in a Natural Setting","The only reason I did not give this zoo 5 stars is because the signs giving information of the different animals did not specify the genus of each species and did not go into enough details. But the setting is gorgeous and natural, and the animals all look very happy and well cared for. The zoo is helping breed some endangered species such as the Penisular Pronghorn, and Visayan Warty Pig. The staff is very friendly and knowledgable, and I learned a great deal from the woman in the Orangutan center. The variety of primates is very complete, with Bonobos, Mandrills, Spider Monkeys, and various lemurs. Parking is free and the entrance fees are low. If you have to eat, get the $3 soft serve ice cream. Do not get the $15 two-churro special. The burger and fries for $12 is actually not a bad deal, but the rest of the food is overpriced.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnastaciaM7
50,Had a great time.,"I had a really great time. Went first thing when zoo opened so I saw most animals out and about before the heat of the day. Yes, it's spread out and very hilly but I had no problem finding seating in the shade, drinking fountains, and restrooms. No school groups on day I was there which was nice. There were a lot of younger kids but they were very well behaved. I don't even want to know how many pictures I took!! I was there for 4 hrs but lingered at quite a few enclosures of my favourites.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/londonrayne
10,A sad disappointment admist high hopes,"I went to visit the LA Zoo early Sept. 2011 and it was a disappointment. Maybe I am developing a more passionate disdain for animals in captivity but this Zoo just really doesnt help the cause. Yes, kids can go there with the possibility to learn alot (maybe) OR they can join the rest of the hundreds of kids and etch their names, tags, or love interests in the blades of the aloe plants and succulents along the path.There is hardly any roaming room for any of the animals. I would say the gorillas have it better than most of the animals, but even still..arent zoos supposed to simulate natural environments??! This Zoo DOES NOT! The animals all seem sad, depressed and confined to an unhealthy degree. The Chimps,bear, monkeys,hippo, tiger, and ALL of the birds (with NO flying room) are such a sad sight. To top it off they have a three-legged gazelle who is confined in a space the size of a short hallway away from anyone whom she may interact with. Its like the disabled are truly unfairly treated. Along with all of the disregard for how these animals actually live in the wild, there is no supervision among the staff. There were kids banging on glass of the exhibits and this was on a slow Saturday morning just as the Zoo opened.Overall, this zoo is a sad sight and it seems like there is something more going on behind the scenes that needs legal action to defend the rights of these animals.In addition to the sad and helpless animals, the Zoo itself left nothing to be desired visually. Everything is under construction, and dry and barren. Their big installment is a merry-go-round...since when did plastic horses on a circular tram become a real animal attraction and enriching experience with wildlife?!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/globalgirl83
40,"Nice zoo, resonable prices",Park is well kept. Lots of walking and hills. Animals were visible. Food was good.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TonyTTA
30,Bland,FOr this to be a zoo that serves a large metro area the exhibits are just run of the mill. The elephant attraction seemed to be above par but due to the fact we didnt see any elephants left it up to our imagination. There is plenty of construction going on and the signage that leads to the animals and give directions are poor in my opinion. 2 adults and 3 kids age (3-5) set us back $55. I would like $40 of it back!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chundell
30,"Ok but needs better signs, directions to the animals.","So I visit the Zoo because is was economical it was around the same area I was visiting and well you can't go wrong with a zoo right? well I was a little disappointed because most of the must see animals were inside their den so very few exotic animals were roaming out, well you can expect that sometimes at Zoo's. The problem here is that there is not a comprehensive way to tour this zoo, which made it a not so great experience and one of the reasons I will not come back here. Example you walk, walk in the sun and there is not a water fountain not a hose not a cooling station nothing to make you comfortable there are a few sugary icee stands I counted 2 by the way and one snack bar at the very end of the zoo, but other than that good luck finding a restroom or a free water drink; the other problem I encounter was that they need to label their roads to the exhibition better you walk and walk and walk along roads side roads intersections and most of the time you either go in circles or miss something, now I'm very good at planning in advance how I want to visit something but here either the sun will get you or the lack of coherent directions will. As for the animals most of what you will see for sure are the caged bird animals, all the other ones Lion, elephants, etc not really, it depends how hot the day is. So yes I'm glad I came, I saw but will not be back here, I hope you have a better day than I did, the only tip I can suggest is to arrived early on opening hour when is cool and bring plenty of water to drink.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gian99Ca
50,We went for the flora but fell in love with the fauna,"Who would have thought that in the middle of the City of Los Angeles there is a bucolic, relaxed Botanical Garden that hosts exotic animals to boot! the LA Zoo is an accredited Botanical Garden, so we really went to enjoy the wonderful flowers, bushes, trees and even a rare and magnificent collection of cycads. All of that did not disappoint...there's eve3n a garden tended by volunteers that grows treats for the animals~ (Gorillas love roses.) But we left having fallen totally in love with the fascinating creatures that inhabit the Zoo. Some of them are extremely rare -- the komodo dragon, the fossa from Madagascar, the Chacoan peccaries, the mountain tapirs and the giant river otters, to name just a few. Many of the animals on exhibit are threatened and endangered, and we left realizing we really need to actiively do what we can to make sure these magnificent creatures can survivel",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Davitt1
40,Fun Day Trip,"We planned to arrive early, but got a little lost due to construction. This could have been avoided if I had double checked the directions! Once we got there, we saw the animals quite active until the heat of the day after lunch time. After that, we saw mostly sleepy animals, so I would recommend arriving as early as possible. The layout of the zoo is on a hilly landscape, so my kids got tired and needed a little rest in the shade occasionally. We also went through lots of water to stay hydrated. We were excited about the new elephant exhibit which was great - don't miss it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vaykayfam
20,Go early,"I'm told typical LA weather is overcast in the morning until around lunch, when the sun breaks through and the temperature warms. Common amongst all zoos, outdoor animals take refuge when it gets hot. The best time to come is at opening and see your favourite exhibits first. The layout of the zoo is a little troubling, the right-half of it is a big dead end, you have to double back all the way to the middle branch to get back out. Everything is more expensive inside the zoo but if you have been to a zoo or amusement park before this will not be a shocker. During our visit the giraffe exhibit was the best, with three animals of different sizes making for some unique photo opps. Most of the other exhibits were ehhh.. if you could see the animals, they were just sleeping or sitting still. Terrain is hilly but there are ramps so you can negotiate the whole park with a wheelchair or stroller. There is a ""Safari Shuttle"" but we did not take it. Since it uses the closed service road, you may get better views/photos on this ride @ $4 each. If you are planning to hit the Aquarium of the Pacific, you can buy a combo pass at either location to hit both.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/findcoop
50,Good Place To Go When There Is Good Weather!,"Went here last week with my mom, aunt, and my two little cousins. My little cousins love animals, and playing with stuffed animals, so we of course had to take them to the zoo. I'm a bit older, and thought that the zoo was kind of lame, but I definitely enjoyed myself as well.The animals were super upclose, and I felt like I could reach out and touch a lion. Pretty cool! There were not a lot of people when we went, and the zoo was clean and didn't smell too bad. The food was a little expensive, especially to feed my cousins who eat more than all the animals at the zoo put together!I recommend this zoo, just have lunch beforehand!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TyrellS
40,Good compact Zoo,We were able to visit this zoo and see all the animals in about 3 hours. It is well organized and they have an impressive collection of animals. Many of the cages are small but the animals appeared to be well cared for. Don't miss the elephant feeding - very close up and interesting.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/side-tripper
40,Really great zoo!,"We've been to a LOT of zoos and this one is great. Great value. I will say that we should have eaten lunch BEFORE we entered the zoo because we paid as much for lunch for four at Reggie's Bistro as we did to get into the park. Literally. It was delicious food though.We saw animals we'd never seen before, which says a lot because sometimes you feel like you're seeing the same animals at every zoo. The animals were like in their natural habitats. The pens were upclose and personal. Great, unobstructed views of them animals and their environments. Loved it.The park closes at 5pm everyday, I think. We knew this. We arrived around lunch time and stayed the whole time. The animals start going in around 4pm but we felt like we saw a lot and there were things we didn't get to see. It was a rather long line for tickets but the wait wasn't more than 10 minutes.They even had a play area for children. Everything seemed pretty clean and well kept.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CinnaPatty
40,Some exhibits closed early....we still had fun,"My family and I went to the zoo March 12th. We had a amazing time. I'm originally from Southern California and when I visit with my family we always go to a attraction while were in town. First it was a nice day when we got to the front gates to get out tickets that line, was crazy long. Our first thought was on, no! but the line moved fairy quickly. I was a lil disappointed because they didn't offer a military discount but the tickets were pretty cheap. We got our tickets and went on our way. Although the lines were long and there were tons of people we never felt crowded. The zoo was very clean and although there weren't lots of sun on the day we attended on the summer days it would be perfect. The only complaint that I have is we arrived around 12:30pm and about the time we reached the petting area it was closed for the day. It closed at 1pm. Also my favorite animal (elephant) was also tucked away for the evening when we reached their area. The zoo closes at 5pm on Saturdays and there was still lots of time before they closed. I was a little disappointed that they put some of the animals away, so early. The highlight of the day was the monkeys. They were very active and mating! My two year old loved it. She jumped and clapped her hands the entire time. Overall we had a great time and I really enjoyed our day at the Los Angeles Zoo.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michelle_wright3
50,"Better than the ""world famous San Diego Zoo"" by miles!!!!!!!","We love animals and enjoy modern zoos so on a very balmy Saturday in October visited this Californian gem.We have been to quite a few zoos and think this is sooooooo much better than the San Diego Zoo by miles. For a start, its bigger, more open, more accessible, less crowded. Also, unlike San Diego, they dont tell you every 5 seconds that the plants are worth more than the animals (nice?!).an absolute beautiful place to go! Take your time and stay here for a few hours. We saw animals that we have never seen before so it was great & they seem much loved & very happy. Would love to see the end results of the exensions that were going on when we were there - looks brilliant! So, we must revisit.....cant wait!Our compliments to the Zoo!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jhoppy01
40,A Major Mammal Collection,"Giant Otters, Maned Wolves, Crested Capuchins, Coquerel's Sifaka, Gabriella's Gibbons, Giant Pecaries, Speke's Gazelles, Visayan Pigs, Calamaian Deer, Francois' Langurs, Yellow-footed Rock Wallabies, Yellow-backed, and Red-flanked, and Black Duikers, Mountain Tapirs, Nubian Ibexes, Harris' Ground Squirrels, a Lesser Indian Civet, Queensland Koalas, Baja Pronghorns, Japanese Serow, Giant Eland, Mountain Bongo ...From the time it opened, Los Angeles has always had a reputation among zoo professionals for an unusually large series of mammals from around the world, with an emphasis on rarities. It used to have a very large bird collection also, but presently, it is not one of the more extensive ones. There are still quite a lot of impressive birds, among them a Japanese Mountain Hawk Eagle, given to Los Angeles by it's Sister City, Nagoya, and an important breeding group of Cape Vultures. LA Zoo has been vitally important in the succesfful effort to bring back the California Condor from the brink of extinction, and many have hatched there, but, for the time being, none of the ones at the zoo are publicly displayed, though there is a huge and very complex California Condor education center, full of hands-on activities for young people, right next to the front entrance. The old reptile house has been closed, but an entirely new one is set to open. Among the rare reptiles and amphibians that will be displayed there are Giant Horned ""Toad"" Lizards, and Shovel-headed Tree Frogs.There is always some new construction porject going on, and, as the zoo has occupied the same site since the 1960's, it's likely to be the case for a long time... An enormous breeding and interpretive center for Asian Elephants was just opened.The zoo was originally mostly arranged by continent. This has broken down somewhat over the years, and the zoo's exhibit philosophy appears to be in a state of transition. There is definitely a zoo where one will want to have a map in hand, as many exhibits are tucked away along winding paths. It's definitely worthwhile to look for them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zoogoer
40,Great Zoo Trip for the Young and Restless!,L.A. Zoo has a good number of exhibits which can be viewed in just a couple hours or half a day. It's not that big and doesn't take all day which is great for small kids who would tire out after just a few hours. It has a small petting Zoo but it is not always open on weekdays. It's currently going though some construction with its elephant and reptile exhibits. The zoo membership is a great deal for couples and families! Never seen it so crowded where it was uncomfortable. Always a neat experience for my husband and I and our little kiddo.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rknjl
40,"Tons of fun, Free Parking","Where can you go in Los Angeles that has free parking??? Practically nowhere, thats what makes the zoo even better. I highly recommend buying a year pass if you plan to go more than once. It is a great value. You can walk through the whole zoo in less than 2 hours or spend the whole day there. At Christmas there are fun projects for the kids to do. Also through out the year there are wonderful events that you can attend. Kids of all ages love it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hansydsmom
40,Fun family trip,A fun place to spend a family trip. I would pack your own lunch and there is limited selection and a burger will cost 10+,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kobe824
40,"Great Zoo, if you are up for a walk","This is a beautiful zoo, now that the construction is over. They began remodeling the Gorilla habitat 4 years ago, and just completed it this year in 2010. They have everything, and it's all laid out well in a nice path, but it is all uphill. So be cure to wear your walking shoes!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wolfgangdisney
10,L A Zoo,"Visiting the L A Zoo was a sad waste of time. I have not been there in over a decade and it is NOT the Zoo I remember....I took a friend who had never been there and was sooo dissapointed. So few animals, mostly concessions. There is consruction going on, however, it does not change how dismal it is. The free flight bird Aviary had very few flying birds but lots of Flamingos that you already see going in. One lonely Tiger, didn't see any Lions a couple Bears, I remember several kinds of bears once upon a time. All in all would not go back. Don't wast your time or money very depressing even the animals seem depressed...how very sad I used to enjoy the place - .Go to the San Diego Zoo!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pacflyway
40,A pretty good zoo,"It was pretty fun walking around the LA zoo. It is in a gorgeous area and the facilities for the animals seem nice. The terrain of the zoo is pretty hilly so be warned to wear comfy shoes. The only down side was when we went they were doing a ton of construction so some animals weren't on display. If you want to save a couple bucks get the Aquarium of the Pacific and Zoo combo ticket. I think you save like 8 bucks, so that is great. Also, parking is free, which is a rarity in Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dodg1988
20,Not a good zoo,"Keep going with the renovation, L.A. Zoo, and if possible, take it out of the hands of the people in charge. For all the stuff that has been done to the zoo over the years, there is so much that has not even been tried. The animals do not have nearly enough enrichment to keep them happy mentally-the hippopotamus in his woefully small pool was just lonely and still, staring at his own feet. The way most exhibits have been set up is very outdated by at least fifty years. The exhibits are nothing like the natural habitats of the animals they house and mostly they are made up of concrete floors and cages too small for the animals they house-while I was there I witnessed a red tailed hawk stuck in a cage that only a hummingbird would comfortably call home.We visited on a hot August day. We noticed that most of the animals did not have adequate access to water or shade. We watched the gorillas sweat like pigs as their sole water source was broken, there were no places for them to climb,and shade was very little: more like gorillas in misery than Gorillas in the Mist. The lions, an African animal that can have enormous territories in the wild, had a postage stamp sized exhibit and two lions that looked like the only time they got enjoyment out of life was when they ate.Overall, I would say that this is a zoo that is nowhere near befitting a major metropolitan area and that Los Angeles deserves a MUCH better zoo, a better place to educate the public about the natural world, and a total outright makeover of the entire thing, up to and including moving the zoo to a larger piece of real estate. Skip this place if you are traveling. Go to San Diego",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mkegnyc
10,horrible place to visit. I'm an Angelino...,"horrible place to visit. I'm an Angelino and must say I have never seen the LA Zoo look so unkept, dirty, smelly, and depress. The animals look half dead as if the life was sucked out of them. Yes, the admission price is reasonable with free parking BUT it's not worth walking around seeing every exhibit close as well every mark point filled with bird poop. I recommend SD Animal Park o the SD Zoo.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tortilla4
10,Literally stinks,"Lots of construction going on and very few animals. What animals there are, seem very depressed and it wasn't pleasant viewing them. They are quite obviously unhappy. They are in enclosures that are so small that they can't run or play. The zoo is dirty and not well kept - basically, it looks like it's falling apart.The employees were not very helpful or courteous and gave us the impression that we were taking up their time or bothering them.But the worst thing about this zoo is, IT STINKS! It absolutely reeks of urine and feces. I've been to plenty of other zoos: San Diego, Palm Desert, San Diego Wild Animal park, etc. and none of them smelled like this place does. peee-yeww!Yes, it's inexpensive, but now you know why. It smells, it's dirty, and you can tell that no one really cares about the zoo or the animals. Pathetic, but that's Los Angeles for ya.San Diego has gorgeous zoos as well as Palm Desert, both within driving distance of L.A. Don't waste your money. They should tear the place down and let another zoo rescue their mistreated animals.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aristacah
30,"Above average animal variety, below average exhibition quality.","We are members of the Phoenix Zoo and expected great things from a zoo in a city the size of LA. However, we found that our zoo (in our opinion) is superior to the LA zoo. This sprawling zoo is confusing and would be impossible to navigate without a map. The smaller exhibits are poorly designed. They have a thick wire fence surrounding each of them, which frequently made it difficult to tell if there was an animal in the exhibit, at all! This poor design is repeated over and over throughout the zoo. The larger exhibits were much more visitor-friendly. The zoo has a good variety of animals. However, at times the variety seems unnecessary (who needs to see three different species of wallaby?!?).At $13 per person, the zoo is relatively affordable (especially as prices go in LA!).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tauren
50,A great zoo,All around a great day trip. Lots of shade and water fountains. Seems like a pocket of nature in the middle of the city. The reptile house was our favorite. Animals all seem healthy and well maintained.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gills85
40,Wide Variety of Great Animals,"We needed an activity for a half day during the latter part of our LA vacation and we decided a zoo visit would be nice for our 3 boys (12,9,6). We were really pleased that the parking was free, plentiful and close to the entrance. There was quite a long line at the ticket window, so if you have a way to get the tickets beforehand, do it. Fortunately, the line moved just fine. Tickets were very reasonable and they were offering a deal on a dual ticket for the LA Zoo and the Aquarium of the Pacific (Long Beach).We've been to several major zoos, but we were constantly saying something like, ""I've never seen one of those before."" It was great to see such a wide variety of animals in this expansive zoo.We were a little let down at the amount of construction going on during our visit. I guess it's a good thing that they're investing during these tough economic times.Make sure you have your walking shoes on because the exhibits are spread across a huge area, including a fair amount of hills. I felt sorry for those pushing strollers through the LA hills!We went on a Sunday afternoon, so it was quite busy and sometimes hard to get into a place where you could see the main attractions.Give yourself a good 3 hours if you want to see all the attractions on a busy day. Once the new construction is completed, the zoo will be even better. Head on over to the LA Zoo if you have a few hours to spare in area. You won't be disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BigD_CA
40,A good priced attraction,"For the price i think this is a great place to spend the day.Everything is so outraegeously priced these days, this is cheaper then the majority of things ---the snacks inside are the usual overly high price , but i did see people inside with their own food they broguht in.I dont know if they were supposed to or not.It was raining the day we went but we still saw most of the animlas and i didnt mind because there was no crowd-although when we were leaving it was filling up some.i would say to go in the winter months though because i can tell if it is crowded in summer it wont be very fun pushing yur way up and down the stairs to see certain things or just to get a good view of any animals.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/goingblonde
40,Great to visit but has perpetual construction,"We actually have a membership at the LA Zoo and attend with our children (ages 4 and under) several times a year. Our kids always love a trip to the zoo. They especially like the newest addition, which is the gorilla exhibit. Viewers can get a great look at them through floor-to-ceiling glass panels in some areas of the exhibit. We also like the giraffes and the chimps, which both have great viewing areas as well.The unfortunate part of the zoo (currently and for a few years now) is all of the construction going on. They are building a new exhibit for the elephants, and it's a pretty massive section that is blocked off for that. On our most recent trip this month (October 2009), there was an additional section under construction near the seal lions and alligators and I'm not even sure what that will be for.If planning to visit, I would allow about a half of day there. It's quite hilly and requires a lot of walking, but it can be covered in about a half a day I would say. The animals there are pretty typical...nothing too exotic or out of the ordinary. There is a petting zoo, lions, tigers, leopard, black bear, hippo, kangaroos, koalas, monkeys, gorillas, orangatans, chimps, zebras, flamingos, to name a few of the more common animals.There is also a free bird show that usually runs a couple times a day. We have seen it several times, and while it is always the same, it is well done and worth the time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pksedy
40,Fun trip for the family,Lots of animals to see. Plan to spend at least 3 to 4 hours to walk around and see all the animals. Bring good walking shoes and a camera,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cmarx
40,Great zoo at a great price!,"My wife and I just got back from a weekend trip up to LA (we live in San Diego and visit the SD Zoo frequently) and had a wonderful time visiting the LA Zoo. We did do our homework and checked Tripadvisor reviews and the zoo's website and was a bit worried by some of the reviews posted. I'm happy to say we were really impressed by the diversity of animals they had on exhibit, how inexpensive the cost of admission is when compared to the San Diego Zoo, and how well the zoo looked overall. We did get to visit the former SD Zoo resident Jabba the Hippo in his new digs. The only negative that I can recall was the line to get in was pretty long and we waited for a several minutes. Overall I think it's definitely worth checking out if you're an animal lover. We hope to be back soon when the elephant exhibit is finished.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ikaikaokaaina
40,Love the Zoo!,"The L.A. Zoo is great. If you love animals, being outdoors and exercise, this is the perfect place to go. The only downfall are the onslaught of obese America in herds pushing their adult children in strollers and looking miserable. If you can get around them, you'll have a wonderful time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dudelit
30,Pleasant trip to zoo,We went to the Los Angeles zoo on our final day of our LA vacation last week. It was a really nice day in the 60's. They had many different kinds of animals. If you are looking for something different to do In LA especially after doing alot of the more popular attractions try the zoo. In my opinion this is good with kids or without.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/turkey2009
50,I Love LA Zoo!,"I love it so much, I visit it often ... very often. First, I need to walk ... so, I figure, why not walk at the zoo?! It keeps my interest, and there is always something for me to learn or see. There is not only some very interesting creatures, there are pathways with beautiful greens, trees, and flowers.I am particularly fond of the primates, especially the great apes, as well as the lions, tigers, snow leopards, Desert Bighorn Sheep, Maned Wolf, and Snowy Egret. Campo Gorilla Reserve and the Red Ape Rain Forest that houses the orangutans are musts for me. I've gotten to know all the Gorillas and Orangutans by name.Kelly is the big silverback and troop leader of the gorilla family group which also consists of Evelyn Rapunzel, and his daughter Glenda. Auntie Evelyn and Glenda can be very social, while Rapunzel keeps a motherly eye on Glenda, and Kelly keeps tabs on the ""goings on."" There is also a bachelor gorilla pad which houses Hasani (a new silverback) and his younger half-brother Jabari.The Rain Forest is home to six Orangutans. Bruno is a very large male Bornean-Sumatran Hybrid. Minyak is a large who came to the zoo several years ago very ill with a chronic lung infection and very depressed. Minyak has since had surgery and gets regular breathing treatments, and he is doing so well that he fathered 4 yr old Berani with Kalim. Minyak is now paired up with Rosie, who is Kalim's half-sister. Rosie's mother, Eloise (40 yrs old) was born at the zoo. She has cerebral palsy and mental disabilities, but does incredibly well. She is such a joy to watch. Though she does things slowly, she does most of the things the other adults do. She also had several other off-spring. Berani often keeps crowds busy with her antics ... but, then again, so does her very mischievous mother Kalim.The 13 chimps can really be a handful. They are quite a dynamic group. As in the wild, the males are always fighting for the alpha spot.Individuals can get full year memberships for as low as $45, couples for $60, and families for $75.The best days to come are weekdays during the fall, winter, and spring when the children are in school. There are only a few visitors at those times with whom to contend. School groups normally leave by 1 or 2 pm, and so there are even fewer by 2pm.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MickiP
40,A good tip sheet for the L.A. Zoo,"I love the L.A. Zoo, and I feel that the animals are well treated and the facilities are being improved all the time. The new gorillas exhibit is amazing, you feel right up close. I've also been four inches away from a red ape (with glass, of course). I do often feel like I'm wandering around the backs of enclosures, or on some sort of service road, but I guess that's due to the fact that most of the space is devoted to the comfort of animals. There's a great tip sheet for doing the zoo with kids at http://tinyurl.com/7ldacp.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ljoycew
10,An Endless Walk,"Lots of beautiful plants and trees. If you like walking, this is a pleasant place to walk. If you go there to see animals (duh) you will be very disappointed. Walk 5 minutes to see an animal. No animal there, maybe it's in the den, or maybe the cage is empty. Walk another 5 minutes. Another ?empty? cage. Walk another 5 minutes to the next cage. Etc. etc. Continue walking.Walking.Forever walking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ArkansasJohn
10,Honestly the worst zoo that I have been to,"I went to the zoo recently with my son. It seemed as if half the zoo was under construction and many of the cages were empty. The nice exhibits like the giraffes were overwhelmed and overcrowded with people. At the kids zoo there were a few goats out and tons of kids on them. The best part of the LA Zoo was the kids playground. In that case, why pay to go to a playground, when you could visit your local park for free.The zoo lacks the attention is deserves. I still think that the St. Louis Zoo is the best in the country- free and well cared for. Hopefully it will rebound.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/go4bal
50,A Pleasant Griffith Park Experience,"Although less publicized than the zoo in San Diego,this fine zoo is much less expensive. It has the usual array of zoo animals in a very pleasant environment.My favorite animals were the gibbons,Masai giraffes,and okapi.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/margatemensch2016
40,Getting better every time I visit,"As a LA area resident for the last 21 years, I have seen the Zoo existing in a ""cramped, almost bankrupt, animals dying left and right mode"" in the 1980's and 1990's"" and now, in the few last years as a totally different, expanding, and exciting place. We just came back today (2006-11-10) with my 5&9-year-old boys and grandparents for their 40th anniversary. Although there still are cramped quarters for many birds and some mammals, there is a LOT of new construction. Evidently they have raised a lot of money, because the new “Red Ape” (Orangutan) and Chimpanzee areas are very exciting, as is the small but nice “sea cliffs” sea lion area. Also all the signs and literature are in English and Spanish, so at least they know their clientele.This weekend they were selling annual family passes for $55 plus giving out two complimentary day passes (for the grandparents, no doubt). The admission line was enormous, but we jumped out of that line, bought our memberships, and marched on in. The entry plaza is nice (almost like a Disneyland Main Street) with separate gift shops for animals of Asia, Africa, North America, South America, and Australia. The walking paths are modest but the trees and bushes are almost jungle-like. This is in sharp contrast to the San Diego (Escondido) Wild Animal Park where you can walk for almost a mile in the scorching heat with no shade. You can pretty much see the LA Zoo in a single day. We really enjoyed the fact that in many cases, you got extremely close to many animals.The Zoo is located in Griffith Park (largest municipal park in the US), which also has 100 miles of horse trails, a real train yard of antique trains, pony rides and mini-train rides, carousel, polo grounds, hiking trails and even small caves, the Griffith Observatory (by reservation only for 2006-2007) and across from the Zoo, the Gene Autry Museum. The adjacent Forest Lawn Cemetery is world-famous for its chapels and artwork.If you have a week to spend in LA, give Griffith Park 2-3 days and be sure to include the Zoo. You should not spend more than 2 hours on the Hollywood Strip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SteveLicata
50,Wonderfull,Located off the I-5 north and 134The LA Zoo was a great treat for the entire family.We arrived early to avoid any crowds and parking problems.Ticket line was quick and once inside the facilty we noticed how lush and green the grounds were.Zoo map made it easy for us to navigate and we certainly found the park a wonderfull place to stroll and see all the animals and plants. I only wished that I had taken my family here years ago.No problems with crowds once Lunch time came around either.A must visit if you haven't already.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/skelly3055
10,Really sad,"Visited in March. Weather was great and lots of lush vegetation to enjoy while taking the zoo in; however, most of the animal exhibits were small and literally looked like cages. A lot of construction is going on. Went hoping to take lots of pictures but overall experience was uninspiring and kind of sad.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SteveNM
10,Depressing for animal lovers,"I recently visited the LA zoo but left the zoo saddened by the horrid conditions of the animals. I understand its a zoo and the animals arent going to be free, but when HUGE birds of prey (hawks, etc) are in cages 10 feet high, such that the top of their heads are touching the chain link roof, not enough is being done for these animals! The coyotes were isolated and cramped in small enclosures. I just hope funding for this zoo decreases so that the animals can get different homes. Go to San Diego Zoo instead. Its worth the extra bucks and wont leave you feeling helpless and sad.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FarAway8915
40,Being updated & loved the Botanical Gardens...,"The L.A. Zoo has been undergoing alot of renovation! Most recent updated exhibits are the Chimpanzees, Red Ape Rain Forest and the Komodo Dragon exhibit. This summer 2005, a new front entry plaza is opening with Sea Lion Cliffs. It will have an underwater viewing area, as well as a Children's Education Center.New, larger exhibits are now under construction for the gorillas (a rain forest) and the elephants. A new reptile house is also planned.One of the nice things about the L.A. Zoo is that it is also an accredited Botanical Garden. When I visit the zoo, I come home refreshed after seeing all of the beautiful trees and flowers. I also enjoy the exhibits that have beautiful waterfalls, such as the large flamingo exhibit.If you are a Los Angeles resident, I recommend buying a Pass for the year...a real bargain.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/loveLA
50,It is a great place for kids!!!!!!!,"My children loved the zoo and the walking was great . In between the animalss exhibits, they discussed the last animals and they really learned a lot. I recommened all parens to treat their children to an exciting day with the animals.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Journey12530
10,"A sad, depressing place for animals","I recently moved to So Cal and I have been wanting to visit the LA zoo.I finally went yesterday with a bunch of excited friends, and I was terribly dissapointed!!! The whole time I was there, I couldn't believe the number of empty cages and exhibits. The few animals I saw looked very loney and sad, which eventually depressed me.The worst was when I got on the SAFARI shuttle. It charged $4 per person, so I thought it runs through a field with live animals. Soon I learned that it was just a shuttle that moves people from one point to another.I left the park with a huge disappointment. When I told my co-workers the next day that I went to LA zoo, they all asked me, ""WHY?!""Save your energy. Leave LA zoo out of your schedule. There are much more things to see in LA than this collection of sad animal cages.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Flyer21561
10,Hated it,The zoo was not that exciting. The exhibits were too far apart. Also there wasnt too many animals there. The Fresno zoo was a far better zoo in my opinion. Next time I will drive the extra miles to go to the San Diego Zoo instead.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Companion8700
