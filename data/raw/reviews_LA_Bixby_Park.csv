40,Nice place for a jog,"In the early morning, there isn't very many people around. It has a nice pond to run by. The grass is well kept so you can stop, sit down and take a breath.",MalandLine
40,Very nice park and great area for dogs t play,"This is a very nice, though somewhat small, dog park in Bixby Park. The have the dog park area divided into two separate sections, one for small dogs and one for big dogs. I was proud when my growing puppy ""graduated"" from the small dog section and joined the big dogs.",Marcia C
50,GREAT SPOT TO RELAX AND HAVE A PICNIC,"The entire area is so friendly and inviting. The park area is great to wander, there are some excellent places to grab a bite to eat or wander across the street and take in the ocean. Fun place to people watch, especially on the weekend.",SenorGancho
10,Avoid this park,"Sadly, this park is full of meth addicts, homeless and mentally ill people. There is a farmer's market that's good on Tuesday evenings and Saturdays. Otherwise avoid this park.",LLZups
30,"Good during the day, watch the homeless at night","This park is cool on Tuesdays and Saturdays when there's the farmer's market going on. Lots of people, families, kids, etc... lots of good deals and unique finds in Long Beach! They also have tons of bbq grills and work out equipment if that's your thing.The only downfall is the Rite Aid pharmacy next to this park. This store allows dogs and not the service animals either. I've been a dog owner in the 80's and 90's and never allowed my dog inside a store. My dog stayed at home where he belonged, guarding my house. Now you have all these out of towners that moved to LB and bring their non-service dogs everywhere. Not cool to people who just want to browse the aisles, get their goods and go home. Now you have to navigate the aisles and watch out for dog poo or dog pee. Horrible.",townieconcierge
30,July 4th and others,"Possibly most crowded for fireworks on 4th of JulyI left here early and traffic was damn heavy. Prepare for any national events .There's a jazz band playing in early evenings and I like that mood .Great place to pass by and reach the beach., Too many 'invisible person' pushing karts though.One of them spoke out , open fired on my back. I dunno but it was human. Couldn't recognise gender or any sort. Terrible.",T i M
40,A nice neighborhood park,"Located, south of Broadway to south of Ocean to the bluffs, which in WWII had gun emplacements now gone, from Cherry to Junipero is a nice sized park. It has a children's play area, Picnic area, a Band Shell and other parks buildings. Nice place to relax or have a picnic, See Long Beach Parks and Recreation web site for more information.",BobandMargie G
40,View of the Ocean!,"It is a good park, but what you there for is the view of the Ocean. Very pleasant to walk your dog here. It is also a nice place to have a picnic. There are lots of things to do in the area, close by is the Long Beach museum of Art which is a fun visit!",Tricia T
50,Great Park with free body weight workout machines,"This is a nice little spot to visit. The park isn't all that big but does offer skateboarding areas, free use your own body weight machines that can be fun, barbeque areas and benches that you can grill on, and is extremely close to the beach, you can actually see the ocean. So there are plenty of things to keep the family entertained. In addition, Long Beach has many free events here such as concerts and free movie nights. All these things make this small park fun to visit and as said, you can literally head to the beach in minutes with a short walk.",TravelingFutureTales
50,Family's Retreat,"It is an ideal place for multiple activities.A family outing with the sea side walk as a bonus, an open air BBQ or a brisk walk to start or end the day, it is a perfect spot.Farmer's market on Tuesday and Saturday adds spice to its taste.",Sufee Ahmed
20,Typical Neighborhood Park,"Don’t get me wrong ... this park is amazing on Tuesdays or Saturday’s when the farmers market is going on and you can get local, fresh fruits and vegetables from multiple vendors.It’s also great if you’re working out and don’t mind sharing your space with random strangers who at times resemble a prison yard recess time.The skate park or the dog walking area are very nice and it sits in a perfect location area between Ocean Blvd and broadway.It’s location is beautiful situated directly across from the ocean with plenty of space. But the recent increase in night traffic to include people looking to partake in “recreational festivities” or the migration of homeless people camping out for the night it can be a little more frightening then expected.My suggestion ... go during the day! If you go at night ... don’t go alone!",Antonio
50,Escaping The Heat,A nice little park near the ocean where we can catch a Sea Breeze during a hot day. There was a lot of activity a lot of people watching I really enjoyed my time and so did my family.,Van L
50,TAKNG A WALK,I was visting on vacation I can across this lovely park in this nice area of Long Beach took a really long walk very relaxing.,revans795
40,Lots of green grass and clean,"This is a lawn and exercise park, not really a sports park but there is plenty of space to create a field. There's a small playground area and skate place. Nice views of the beach and water near Ocean Ave. And you can walk from Bixby via connected parkland along the beach. Interestingly, some of the older trees here were planted by John Bixby himself.","Double ""Ollie"" Winner"
30,Finally Updated !!!,Nice park with updated work out sections all around it. Has a skateboard area and hosts the farmers market every Tuesday and Saturday.Less functional at night with the increased homeless population that has migrated from the city hall area but still fairly safe.,Antonio
30,"Nice Community Park for Sports, Picnics and Twice a Week Farmer's Market - Bixby Park, Long Beach","We went to Bixby Park in Long Beach. I liked the shade trees and green lawn. There is a community center. There is also sports fields such as skate park, volleyball, sports field. Its also is a good place for a picnic and does have barbeque areas.Twice a week (currently Tuesday and Saturdays) they also have a nice farmers market..",mini
50,"Funky, hip shops & eateries on 4th Street","From Lola's Mexican on the west to Aji on the east end, this section of 4th Street is vibrant with an eclectic mix of shops and restaurants. Long Beach managed a revival of the area without bringing in any chain stores, so all of the shopping and eating options are unique and full of character. There's excellent ""new to you"" clothing, and a lovely selection of eateries. Our favorites include Aji, the Social List, and, of course Lola's.",Bob S
30,Both Tranquil and Active,Attractive park within the city. This is a favored spot for locals. I saw a number of walkers and people playing impromptu sports. Very green. Nice landscaping,texas_forrest
30,Great location,"Bixby park has improved over the years but there are ""challenges **The Good ;Location location location..Bixby is almost 1/2 way in between Downtown and The Belmont Shore. It is in the middle of a vibrant social scene of numerous small business incl' artists, hipsters and Gay-Lesbian.The area is undergoing a Renaissance that is attracting many new residents due to the diversity, both social and of housing prices.One can still find reasonable housing near but the new construction closer to the Ocean is no longer a bargain as years ago.E-W boundry :between Cherry Ave and Junipero ave.N-S boundry between The Ocean Ave and Broadway ave.This park has great ocean breezes and clean air. This location also is the scene of a HUGE yoga gathering .Tue Afternoons and Saturday AM has nice farmers market(s) with lot's of fine vendors including fresh prepared Pop-Up cafes, treats of all sorts , fresh Honey Etc.Recently a array of exercise equipment has been placed all over the park and lots of locals like and use them .The Kiddie Climbing equipment is popular.A really nice /Rite Aid Store is on the West border of the park and it has a large parking lot beautifully stocked and clean.""The OK"" : Great looking,brand new restroom..still surrounded by chain link.What is taking so long?. Parking is a ""treasure hunt""Walk,bike or Public Transport is near.Skateboard park that is quite popular with skateboarders****The challenging : despite the tremendous improvements,old ""social Elements"" remain (they occupied the park for a long time)They have not vacated en toto but some say they add an ""edginess"" to the area.Bottom Line, this park has a lot going for it..beautiful Homes just east and cool ocean breeze. Visitors who enjoy an edge'/""inner city grit"" or have enjoyment with a city like New Orleans,will find Bixby Park is ""a piece of cake"".Depending on the time or if there is an event ,best to have common sense when visiting this part of the city.",P-and-A-Belmont
40,Green Space down the Way ...,"Friends took us to Bixby Park the first time and we continue to enjoy going there, especially for the late day Farmer's Market on Tuesday.

40,Free Yoga...Farmers Markets..L.B. Band Concerts and a picnic.,"Farmers markets Tuesday afternoon and Saturday morning. Yoga on the Bluff and in the summer, free Long Beach Municipal Band concerts.

40,My local park,"It is small, it is quaint, there is not much to do or see, but it is a nice little strip of green space with a playground, bbqs, skate site, and exercise space.",Alexander_Designs
50,I love Bixby Park :-),"I am so happy I live walking distance from this park. Every Tuesday there is a great Farmers market at this park from 3pm to 8pm, food, music, vendors. Love it! There's free Yoga every day 11 am and 6pm it feels so great to do Yoga facing the ocean out in the open next to the trees, grass, fresh air and sunshine! Love it! There is free Movies and live music in the summer time. Art fair, swap meet once in a while and so much more. Great for picnics, grilling. beautiful trees and Oh how I love the occasional Butterflies and Dragonflies passing by.. So cheerful and beautiful. I love this Park!",luvangel1883
40,Nice park,"My place looks out over the park so I get a great view of the trees and the soccer games. There is free yoga daily on the bluff. There is a nice playground with sand for the kids...it's fenced in so the little critters can't get away too fast. Avoid this place on the 4th of July. It gets so crowded it's wall to wall people. I hate this one day because this is the day the park goers pee in our driveway. Ugh. There are public bathrooms, but that would be to simple. All in all, the rest of the year it's a nice park.",Marcasso
30,Alright.. nothing special.. safe place to hang out..,"Nice area, old neighborhoods with wide streets and tall palms. lot's of history. It's about 10 minutes from downtown Long Beach.. shopping and the usual city activities are abundant.",Chad H

50,Bixby Park,"This is a really old park, built back in the day. It's a fine place to see. I remember it back in the 1960's When it was in it's Hay day, They had Gas stoves you could cook on back then! Yes just show up with your Pots and pans and fire up the stoves, The have a nice stage there also. They had some good Acts on it. If you like a nice View of the Ocean? Or just a place to do Lunch? This is a nice Park to visit. Short walk to the Beach and nice area. John LaRance Larancejohn@yahoo.com",larance
50,Bixby Park....,I live a few blocks away from this park great park during the day or night.Its very well lit at night...Great view of the ocean from the top of the hill....,element334
30,Lived next to it for a summer,"It's a pretty good park during the day. It comes right up against the beach (although it's a walk down a big hill to it.) There are always kids playing pickup soccer games, so if you enjoy soccer, it's great for watching or playing. After dark, be careful though, as it get's a bit sketchy.",Twilly7
