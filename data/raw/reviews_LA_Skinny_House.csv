30,"It's a skinny house, not much to see.","It is a skinny house, but in Long Beach, people pay high rent, so there are likely many people that would be willing to live there. Go to Rivera's right next door for delicious Mexican food and drink.",Will
40,Nation's Skinniest house,"If you're not familiar with Long Beach, it's really an interesting place, lots to see and do, with lots of uniques neighborhoods and architechture. This is an interesting drive by if you're in the area. 10 minutes max if you take pictures. It is a landmark, and is in Ripley's believe it or not and the Guinness book of world records. I do live in Long Beach, and yes, I had to go see it and get the ""skinny"" !",Chris D
40,"YUP, A SKINNY HOUSE",Fun bit of architecture that if your in the area its worth slowing down the car for and snapping a pic,SenorGancho
10,Really!!,"Go to Amsterdam and see thousands of ""skinny"" houses. Why this is a tripadvisor ""attraction"" is beyond me. Not worth a side trip. Ugly skinny house too.",baaaaaaa
50,Fun,This fun to drive by and take a quick picture but not much else....I do wonder how furniture fits in it and if living there would be comfortable or not......,Susan B
40,It was a skinny house,"It felt a little strange driving by and staring at someone's house, but it was interesting. Would be nice to give tours if it's ever not occupied.",jlthorn1
30,It was a drive by!,"Just a quirky little house on a side street off 7th, it was still fun to see and learn about its history. I would recommend this if you want a quick trip off the beaten path on the way to another attraction. Not worth it's own trip but a nice way to enjoy the journey..... maybe on the way to Starling Diner ;)",Amy P
30,It's a skinny house....,"Yes it is a skinny house. Yes it is in Long Beach. I know that there is a tiny house craze right now, but it is not as though one can tour the home, so there is not much to see.",Alexander_Designs
30,"Kind of interesting, cool design","We biked here from the beach bike trail after learning of the existence of the place recently. Unfortunately it is not open to the public, so you only get to see the place from the street. The place is right off 7th at Gladys behind the Mexican restaurant.",ZumaDawg
30,Interesting office building,"The building is interesting for a law office. The best thing about it is the location, next to one of the best Mexican Restaurants in town. Look at the building than grab a great meal next door.",Van L
20,Just a local curiosity.,Supposed to be the narrowest house in the US--built on a bet on a ten-foot-wide lot. Worth the slight detour if you're in the neighborhood.,David R
40,"Skinny House, Long Beach, California","Before the Depression, a developer purchased land in Long Beach and sub-divided it into lots. There was a tiny 10x50' lot left over. Because people weren't able to buy homes, the developer could not pay his architect (and probably others.) So he gave the architect the tiny lot.The architect took this as a challenge. He designed the house and had his co-unemployed friends (carpenter, plumber, woodworkers, etc., etc.) work for free on the house to show their skills. When it was finished, they had many open houses. Folks would come on the Red Cars and stand in blocks-long lines to see the Skinny House. This way the architect, electrician, plumber, etc. hoped to get new work. It's a very liveable small home! (I am a Realtor who had the Skinny House listed a numer of years ago.)",BarbyLongBeach
40,Easy to find unusual house.,"We found this house with ease using our GPS. We stopped and took a few pictures, as I am sure many people do. Would love to see the inside. Maybe some day they will offer tours.",Karla M
50,I blinked and missed it...,It's very easy to miss. Excellent little hidden gem in Long Beach. It's worth the stop to snap a few pictures. I wish I knew what it looked like inside.,Jae R
40,so thin you might miss it!,"Drove by one day and checked out the build. Sure is skinny. I don't suppose you could really go in and the place is actually behind some trees on the street, but sure enough, its where it stands, just a few feet wide! next time on 7th street, pull off and take a peek",SonicSpringBok
