Chargers up close and personal!,"If you love NFL Football, but are wary of high ticket prices in BILLION-dollar facilities, this will be your last season to see a high caliber NFL team in a close to the action setting.With the Los Angeles Chargers moving to the all-new Rams Stadium opening in Inglewood, CA next season, the Stub Hub Center boasts 27,000 ""good seats"" in a stadium designed for smaller scale sports (mainly soccer).

10,BUYER BEWARE,"BUYER BEWAREWe purchased tickets from Stubhub for a Colorado Rockies Game.When we arrived there were people in our seats, we showed each other our tickets on our phones. They were identical. Long story short we received help from the usher and the ticket office. The game was sold out so seats were short and handicap the best option. The ticket agent couldn't believe the four of were let into the gate to start with having the same identical tickets.We were super upset.We contacted STUBHUB and they basically called us liars because they said no way could two sets of tickets be let in to the park.WELL GUESS WHAT THEY DID LET TWO SETS OF IDENTICAL TICKETS IN.We paid $166 and the seats were great, too bad we could not sit in them.

50,Chiefs vs Chargers,"I attended Chiefs vs Chargers NFL game in September 2018. It was fantastic. Great small venue to see the NFL. Go see a game while you can, only one season left. Great views from all seats although I believe all the seats are bleachers, not seats. Mine were bleachers anyway. Parking is ridiculously expensive though. There are free Chargers buses from a few nearby park and ride lots worth checking out. I took an Uber to the stadium and then walked to a brewery after the game. After a beer I took an Uber from there to head home.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kabrink

40,Excellent Site For American Football,Not a bad seat in the house. Terrific venue for a football game.

50,Great venue for American Football,"Yeah, it’s a “soccer stadium”... But for the time being the LA Chargers call it home and when my Bengals were 4-1 I thought it would be a great idea to do an away game with the Mrs. We got some great seats (on TickPick) and had an overall excellent time. Took the Charger Express (Bus) from a park and ride lot and it was flawless and FREE. That’s my Hot tip... DO IT!!! Re the Stadium, nice wide concourse, typical food selection & pricing (we liked the Alabama meets Texas BBQ), and great sight lines. Alas, the next time the Bengals play the Chargers, the game will be at the ginormous LA “Palace” in Inglewood, parking will cost $100 and no park and ride bus service, but at least it will be sunny and 70 degrees ;-)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarkandBetsy

40,NFL Game: Nice Stadium but Expensive,Nice stadium and no bad views from the seats even in the end zone. Parking is expensive with limited to no street parking $40. The fan zones were great prior to the game and beer was $5 versus $14 in the stadium. The food had variety but once again expensive paid $16 for a poorboy sandwich very salty and moderately warm. Great ambiance with all of the fans close due to the size. One scary point is we had to beg the security to get involved to break up a fight between two patrons.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/avgjoey

40,"A long way to go, however, a very good stadium.","This is definitely not close, however, once you finally get there, it is a pleasant experience. They are very strict on bags, so you don't want t carry much on you. I think that you can have a clear bag or something. I took Uber, so I can't comment on parking. The Uber pick up point is a short walk from the main entrance. There is a good variety of food and drinks, although not cheap, they aren't outrageously expensive like other venue. It is clean and seating is decent. They might not want to do the pyrotechnics before the game, as the smoke seems to stick around for a while. The crowd was good and friendly atmosphere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tiges88

Beautiful venue in the Carson community.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ibaol
50,STUBHUB CENTRE TOURS,"My family and I recently visited the Stubhub stadium while we were on holiday from Scotland and we would all like to express our gratitude to one of your tour guides, Jose Scheurem.We only had 5 days in Los Angeles, but my son Nathan is a huge football (soccer) fan and was desperate to see your stadium and purchase merchandise from your store. We were delayed in traffic (our hotel was in North Hollywood and we didnt quite appreciate how bad LA traffic can be!) so we arrived at the Stubhub Centre later than anticipated.Nathan was very keen to try and see a glimpse of the pitch, so I visited the reception to see if someone could possibly allow him to do so (I used to work at Celtic Football Club in Glasgow and we got requests like this all the time).Even though Jose was at the end of his shift, he very kindly took our family on a full tour off your stadium, showing us your hospitality area's, trophy cabinet and even took us pitchside. He was incredibly knowledgeable and enthusiastic about your club and helped explain some of the differences between football played in the USA and the UK. Our tour lasted in excess of 40 minutes and was one of the highlights of our trip to America.Jose went above and beyond what we expected and I would just like to express myself and my families appreciation for the time and effort he showed for us. He did not have to do this and we are incredibly thankful to him. Nathan wears his LA Galaxy strip with pride whenever he goes out to play football!We will hopefully get the opportunity to return to America some time in the future and will absolutely visit your magnificent stadium again (though we will plan ahead and book a tour next time!).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gandebennett21

50,Chargers vs Saints,"My family and I loved this venue. Simply stated, there aren't any bad seats. We had a blast!!

It was great.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Explore547380
50,Go Chargers,This place is awesome for an NFL game. The worker at the concession stand was totally cool. I was drinking my beer while waiting for my wife’s order and before I left she offered to top me off. How cool is that. Other stadiums need to take from this. Customer service is key. The place is not that big so all the seats are great. We got to seat slightly behind the goal pole so I wasn’t complaining. Parking can be kinda confusing since the signs to park really make no sense. We were lucky enough to score on some street parking and it was about a 10 min walk to the stadium entrance. All in all I would definitely be coming back. #fightforLA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevepQ9581BW
20,Worst sound system,Clearly no one has tested their sound system!! It’s so loud (and I love loud music) but it sounds like the speakers are cracked/broken so it comes out sounding horrible. All the announcers “eat the mic” so half of what they say sounds garbled. It’s just annoying. I’d rather have silence during the games commercial breaks on the field than listen to them.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pegh2017

Tailgating is allowed here.We walked over to a grass area where children were playing football and as is the universal rule our kids joined in.We were lucky enough to meet a family from Wales who had emigrated and as is the American way were offered water and burgers. Very kind.We made our way toward the stadium and stopped to try our hand at the freebie stands. Free coke, t-shirts from Chevrolet and numerous other items we were ready to go inside.Once inside we had free commemorative photos and lanyards.We made our way down to Soccer Fest where there was a DJ, band and loads more freebie stands.We just about made it to our seats in time and were treated to the national Anthem and some fireworks.My husband nipped and got us pizza and drinks. My son had he biggest bag of popcorn at $11.Match was good fun, not the best standard of football but a lovely evening out.Would we return?

50,Mixed Use Venue is Great.,"I took my grandson to the StubHub Center for the KROQ Weenie Roast rock festival. I have not been to a sporting event yet, so this review concerns the ability for StubHub to put on a concert festival.We had a great time. Parking is for a fee, but not outrageous and it is not a terrible walk and there are a lot of handicapped spaces. People direct you to parking and are very nice. Once parked there are a few areas to go to. They have the main venue, which is often used for soccer games. It is large and if you sit up high you will not be able to see much, so try to get decent seats. The evening acts were on this stage. The sound was very good.There is a tennis event type venue there as well. This one we really liked. It is much smaller, there are no bad seats. All of the daytime opening acts were there and the fact is they were better than the evening acts. Mike Shinoda kicked off his solo tour here and he was great. The sound for all the bands was very good.There are places to sit between the various venue areas and lots of places to get snacks or more expensive food. Leaving was easy.We really loved this venue and will be back for other concerts. Have a great time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elizabethlascheid

The stadium seated 40000 plus . Nicely design for soccer , I was told the Chargers also play here waiting for the new stadium to be completed . The parking was orderly. , the seating area very clean and great view . In one section behind the goal. , there is a hardcore fan area when they sung and play drums the whole time . Zlatan scored on a spectacular goal 5 min into the game , ended up in a 2-2 tie , but it seems to be all worth the experience .

50,Great stadium for soccer,"1. Access/Parking: The cheaper lot is $10.00. The walk is a little longer than the $20.00 lot but not too bad. The facility itself has easy access. The stadium is about a mile from the 91 freeway.2. Restrictions: They recently implement the clear plastic bag rule, unless you have a purse that is really small (about 5""x5"").3. Vendors: The entire stadium is surrounded mostly by food vendors. You get a variety of food. The prices are steep that is to be expected.4. Seating: The stadium is small enough that most of the seat are pretty good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jt99941

It was a royal pain....the parking situation is clearly not designed well....the exit at night was not traffic controlled and it was like taking target practice trying to avoid pedestrians....not a good situation at all.....very messy!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bzymamacee
10,The worst experience ever,Although the game was amazing thanks to Ibrahimovic and his teammates...they have no understanding of event management!!!first of all we were not allowed to take a pocket bag with us and had to queue and pay 10dollars to leave it in a truck... good way to make money I guess... such a big stadium and only 1 truck with 2 people!!! U can image the waiting time to drop and to pick your bag up at the end!!! Then they make u walk all the way out to reach the truck... thanks to them we missed 20min of the game and the first goal,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dayanahc
50,LA Galaxy,Had a great time!Pls consider you are not allowed to bring anything! Just your cel and wallet. Not even a purse.

50,A great place to catch the Chargers play,"Get here while you can! No where else can you catch a NFL game in such an intimate setting, The stadium holds just 30,000 people and there's really not a bad seat in the house. There's plenty of legroom, great food and beer available from numerous stands and getting here is easy by public transit (free shuttle busses run from Del Amo and the Harbor Gateway Metro transit stops).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T4232XIjohnb
40,Velo Sports Center,"Went there to compete in the masters worlds track cycling champs, and as such only went to the velodrome, not the other stadiums etc.The track itself is great - pretty quick - and the staff there were excellent. The event was run by Travis Smith ascend was very professionally done.The only issue (and it's probably been mentioned before) is that there are no toilets on the same level as the track ascend warm-up area - you have to climb 2 flights of stairs to get to the toilet area. For this event they did hire a range of probably toilets which were outside the venue, but an easy walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bosco2012
30,Mixed opinion,"Stadium was clean, and sight lines were great due to the smaller venue. Didn't care for the ribbed bench seats that for some reason hit a nerve and make my legs go numb. Watched half the chargers/philly game from the stubhub backyard in the lounge chairs. Lots of venues for food and drink at a steep upcharge and all pretty mediocre from what I tried. Good time but it has room for improvement.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/twysted2015
40,One of the best places to watch boxing!,"I love coming to this place to watch boxing. I've been to many places to watch fights, L.A, Vegas, NYC but this place is one of the best. Outdoor, great atmosphere and not a bad seat in the house. Usually very reasonably priced compared to Vegas and NYC plus it's usually packed since it's a smaller venue.The only reason I wouldn't give it 5 stars is because there are no bathrooms on the floor level and security needs to do a better job checking tickets. I paid a nice chunk of change to get a good seat but some drunk fools somehow snuck on to the floor and sat in the seats in front of me and my wife. If they would've just sat and watched the fight I wouldn't complain but they were being loud (bragging about how they snuck down to these seats) and obnoxious and not even watching the fight! I didn't let it ruin my night but it was annoying. Felt worse for the nice couple sitting next to them.Still, this is a great venue and would recommend watching a fight here if you have the chance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eperez415
50,For a great Los Angeles Chargers experience use Charger Express.,"I make this review with much enthusiasm. This is more a review of the Chargers game experience than the StubHub Center. If you are going to a Chargers game, I heartily recommend that you use Charger Express to get to and from the stadium. Check the team website for the two locations which are terminals for the Long Beach Transit system. You go to the terminal and park (for free) and take the Charger Express bus (also free) to the stadium. They leave the terminal at 10 minute intervals and drop you at the Southwest gate of the stadium. After the game you go to the opposite side of the street and they have a long line of buses available. You get on the bus, when it is full it departs and gets to the terminal in about 20 minutes. From there you have little traffic to contend with. By the way, the stadium is a good viewing venue due to its small size.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ransom007
10,No good for ADA,"If you are in a wheelchair this is not the place to go. Poorly treated in parking lot by attendants. We were not late. No spaces left for ADA, they did not check ID's and paperwork for ADA parking, therefore all the people who borrowed ADA placards were in the spots we should have been in. Very few ramps to get up to the sidewalk, had to push through traffic in a wheelchair to get to a ramp. In the stadium itself ADA seating was pathetic. Felt marginalized, paid the same price as others yet pushed aside to one tiny spot where there was not enough room for the caregiver to get out except by moving her 'chair' a small folding chair. SHC might be in compliance for a soccer game, but not for an NFL game.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/twosrvubtr
40,Chargers home stadium,"They have done a good job dressing up the place to look like an NFL venue. If you went to Charger games at the Q, The sound system, seating, video display and scoreboards are SERIOUS upgrades here. Food options are good (try the loaded BBQ fries at My Father's BBQ) but go before the game starts. Good luck during the game or at halftime. The general concession stands are slow and generic. Not worth what you pay for. We had no trouble getting in before the game, exiting the parking lot was a nightmare (30+ mibnutes to go 300'). Once you get onto the surface streets it moves pretty quickly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/872deanm
40,The Football Experience,"For the NFL fan, having football in StubHub is a great experience. A number of media outlets have referenced low fan turnout for NFL games this year in the Los Angeles market but I can tell you from a visit this past Sunday to StubHub that I am glad we have football here.With respect to soccer fans, StubHub is a soccer stadium first and foremost with a capacity of around 26,000.This is less than half of most NFL stadiums and really creates a unique setting and experience. Pay close attention to this point:no bad seats. There are decent seats, good seats and great seats. Prices are a little higher but with half the capacity,fans really are much closer to the experience.Sight lines were great, Jumbotrons on both ends of the field made watching replays and highlights easy.Bathrooms by stadium standards were clean, lines at the food and beverage concessions that we visited uhm..several times were short, nothing longer than 5 minutes. Quick polite service. Prices slightly higher but not extremely so. Good selection of items if your willing to walk around including some unique food trucks that were on site.Very easy to navigate and a lot of security and law enforcement making sure everyone was safe. No one peaking over your shoulder, just polite and there to help.Arrive at least an hour before kick off to get parked and enter. Patrons with printed tickets were able to get through the turnstiles quicker than mobile ticket customers, something I have paid attention to for my next visit.The one mark on the overall experience is that the cost of parking is steep. $40.00 for general parking (in the realm of normal) and $100.00 for much closer tailgate parking. Seriously $100.00. You either need a prepaid pass or cash on arrival. No RV's/vehicles over 20ft in length allowed. Note, that you may not tailgate in the $40.00 parking area and must be in the stadium once the game starts. $100.00 for tailgate / closer lot parking is a bit of a money grab, feels like that's an opportunity to trim for the fans.All that being said, great blend of fans. A lot of random jerseys out there of teams not playing but people who were just fans out for a day of NFL football. No visible confrontations. Fans from each side getting along. High energy but very family friendly.I know the NFL is only here temporarily. We have this season and the next with an option for a third. That makes taking advantage of this unique way to view football even more special. Having seen games in multiple stadiums, this was almost like seeing a game for the first time again. Very good experience.Easy to get to from the Inland Empire, Los Angeles and Orange County, StubHub is right of if the 91 freeway.For NFL fans, it is worth the experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IEOCRealReviews
30,Not as great as experience for football -Lyft/Uber lot is a trek with no reception,"I attended the Chargers opening game at the Stub Hib center and it was a mixed bag.All seats offer a great view of the game.Being a smaller venue, its a much more intimate experience.The seats were extremely crampe for anyone tall.Concessions were somewhat underwhelming. I didn't see very many vendors in the stands selling food.*** the big negative is the Uber/Lyft lot which is a 10-minute walk at a local school parking lot and when you get there NOT unsurprisingly cell reception is saturated making getting a ride nearly impossible",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marktS5189DV

There was good entertainment prior to the game around the stadium with games for kids to enjoy and live music. Your usual stadium food and drinks at a marked up price.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KiddyBoy
30,Fans were rude but venue nice,"The venue was really nice. Small for NFL but perfectly put together. I like that they allow food trucks inside to give a variety of available meals. Seating was good regardless where u sat.However, LA fans were taunting and so rude toward the LA Chargers. Why come if you don't support them? In KC chiefs stadium u would have been kicked out!! They don't put up with rudeness. Yes this is football and people say things but this was down right loud and uncalled for. I hope the chargers get more support in the future.Venue is great.

50,very impressed!,"modern and impressive center. It offers free WIFI. enjoyed a match and hada great atmosphere, it's a little far from downtown nonetheless I think it is a perfect arena to host major event or concert.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aroundth3world3
50,Wonderful venue for soccer,My wife and I attended a couple of soccer matches there. The stadium was full. Every single seat has a great view. Some parking lots (1 and 2) requires a seven minute walk.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/_vvc13685

50,Fantastic Facilities,"The World CrossFit Games were held at the StubHub Center (formerly The Home Depot Center) from 2010 - 2016. SoCal is a convenient fly-in and family/friends location and the facility is excellent. If you plan to eat at StubHub, prepare for outrageous prices. And if it is a hot day, both the Soccer Stadium and Tennis Arena get as hot as Hades.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/troybrost
40,Wango Tango at Stub Hub,"We were visiting for a concert and I was excited it was at this arena. I found everything to be great. Location a bit out of the way, but that is typical for some of these concert venues. Didn't deal with parking as we were at a nearby hotel. I liked the variety of food they offered although it is extremely expensive. Small enough so not a bad seat in the house. We did sit on the lower level and the sun was warm. I imagine this could be a problem in the summer months. There seemed to be a lack of bathrooms for women. Stood in line for a while.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/caroleannie0113
30,"Cosy, great views!","Came to catch the LA Galaxy vs Montreal Impact game. Overall, decent experience.Some thoughts:- Parking: was confusing... we prepaid our parking and yet when we were directed where to park, the folks handling the parking were unsure where to send us. One at one point insisted we needed to pay $20 to get thru even though we had a ticket that showed we had paid. We finally got through that mess and made it to correct spot.- Seat: Great! Stadium is cosy and smaller than expected. The views were fabulous and made enjoying the game easier.- Fans: a bit more obnoxious than expected. We tolerated it for the most part but after a while, we simply gave up. The language around us was pretty coarse and some of the fans were vulgar to say the least. Being crude when the national anthem plays is not ok. There were young kids sitting around us and we could not understand the behavior.- Food choices: Nothing great - typical fare. We must compliment the lady working there who was great in getting us our pretzel even thought we had to wait 5 minutes.Would we come back? Of course, a soccer game is fun to watch! However, now we know... the fans are intense and the seats we may opt for may be more in the ""reserved/box"" section.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Novemberpeanut
50,Chivas vs Leon at the LA Galaxy home,"It was a tremendous experience at this stadium!! The StubHub Center, home of the LA Galaxy soccer team hosted a game of two Mexican teams Chivas vs Leon.

40,Nice Stadium - Bit out of the way!,I went to see LA Galaxy v Houston in July & it was a good night out.Being used to the EPL in England this is a bit different but the club have done well to make the atmosphere decent & the MLS is really a growing brand!The only issue I would say is the location it is a bit out of the way & without a car it is a bit of a trek.Prices for LA Galaxy MLS games are fairly priced & like most stadiums in the US they have a good selection of food outlets.I am very interested to see how the stadium works when the San Diego now LA Chargers play NFL games here as I do think it is a bit small for NFL matches.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JevesUK

40,Brilliant ground,"Visited for an MLS games while in LA. Easy to get there, we used uber, for a cheap trip.The Stadium is in a good location and plenty of space so it's not too crowded.Plenty of food and drink outlets and plenty of choice. Yes it is expensive but then in USA it always is when there is crowds, it's expected.....try going to Vegas!!!Really enjoyable day and would most certainly recommend people go there for a match.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mightyhorns
40,Enjoyed The Experience - Detailed Review,"Visited to watch Leicester City play PSG in July 2016 pre-season friendly.We flew into Long Beach Airport which is better than LAX in my view, as it is very small, easy to hire a car which is across from the terminal building and it is only a 20 minute/15 mile drive to the stadium from the airport. An extremely easy, stress-free drive.The stadium is in an unremarkable part of Lost Angeles in the Carson district. It is not a particularly attractive part of Los Angeles, it did feel safe but it is effectively in a bland residential area of a suburban sprawl.Nearly all Americans drive to the ground, but if you want to stay over and have a few beers the only place to stay in walking distance is the Hampton Inn, Carson, which is a 10 minute safe walk from the stadium. Not a great hotel but the only one in the area. This particular hotel is also near a couple of fast-food restaurants but I would suggest eating/drinking pre-match at El Pescador Restaurant which is a ""soccer"" friendly bar restaurant, a 3 minute walk from Hampton Inn hotel and 10 minutes walking distance to the ground.Fan Parks were set up by the side of the stadium, basically just an area where you could buy large cans of beer for $14.50!!! Ridiculous prices for food and drinks but this is apparently the case in the US for sporting events.Be aware of potentially long queues to get into the stadium as unlike the UK where there are multiple turnstiles, you enter through a limited number of gates which have airport style security, meaning that you walk through a metal detector and virtually everyone was setting off the alarm. This means slow entry to the stadium so do not leave it too late. Once in the stadium you can walk around the ground as it is unsegregated and you can circumnavigate the whole stadium via the concourse.The stadium was much better than I anticipated with a grass bank behind one of the goals now partially filled in with seating and the sight lines were relatively good throughout the ground. We sat in the lower-priced seats Section 106, Row M and the view was perfectly acceptable for a cost of $45 plus the notorious US booking fees which added a further $11 to the price. Print at home E tickets. I simply could not justify paying well over $100 to be on the halfway line for a pre-season friendly and in the end my decision to purchase a lower-priced ticket was a good one.A strange atmosphere as anticipated, with a good number of Americans wearing Leicester City shirts (surreal) but also a wide range of other shirts on display worn by people with very different reasons for choosing their UK soccer side. American supporters are the world's greatest at mooching and people were constantly walking around. Staff were selling popcorn, churros and candy floss up and down the aisles in the stadium.Overall a good experience, the stadium was much better than I thought it would be and I can imagine there would be a decent atmosphere for Galaxy or Chivas matches. The only problem regarding atmosphere will no doubt be a lack of away support due to the size of the country. We are very fortunate in the UK.Definitely worth a visit if in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LosZorros
40,Home of the LA Galaxy Soccer Team,"My friend and I went to an LA Galaxy soccer game in January 2016. It was a fun time and she ended up getting parking with the tickets. That was a huge saver time wise. The first trip going I think will be a little nerve wracking as not sure where to go, so give yourself time to get your bearings. Great stadium.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DE7313

50,Informative personal tour by a great guide..a must for any football enthusiast,We booked a tour online direct with the stadium. Great value for money. We were the only ones on the tour and it was fantastic. The guide was so passionate about the stadium and told us some many stories even myself who is not into football really enjoyed it. Only takes about an hour but all ages will love it. Parking free and a great way to see the start of something big!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/madamcholet

50,Beautiful Stadium,"First visit to this stadium and I was impressed. Medium size stadium with great lighting, good sound, and not a bad seat.

Getting through the gates were well organized and a breeze into the stadium.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BParent

50,Great Venue,"I had no idea what to expect when my friend and I went to the StubHub Center to watch the Arsenal exhibition match. I was really pleased with many aspects: it was easy to get to, only a few minutes off the 405, the parking was fast (although not cheap), getting into the facility was quick, and once we were in, the layout and seating and atmosphere were awesome. I will definitely be going back to watch more events there. It has a super open feel to it, plenty of food and drink facilities and comfortable seating. Well done StubHub.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MesaSB
40,Different,This stadium was very different from the other ones I have been to. It's under the ground so it's a bit windy. We saw LA galaxy vs new York red bulls. Good match,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nanapiesie
40,Easy to Navigate but Expensive,"Came here with friends to watch Leicester city play PSG the other week. There was plenty of parking available right outside the stadium and plenty of food, beer garden etc.The only downside with these events is obviously the prices - 10-15 dollars for a pint of beer.Atmosphere was great and you can see everything from pretty much any seat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NotAnotherTravelBlog
50,Really Nice Venue!,"First visit to the soccer stadium for an international soccer match, and have to say that I thought it was excellent. Nice facilities, couple with easy entry and exit made the whole event well worth it. Food and drinks are a little pricey, but that's pretty much par for the course anymore at any stadium.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/osokdfa
40,Great place to hold events!,We were there for the CrossFit Games and was impressed by the facility. The option for the soccer stadium and the tennis stadium were great. You can have all types of events there. The seating was great and our event had tons of vendors and everyone had plenty of room to spread out.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lildevil6963
30,Truly Dissapointing,Not a great venue with large crowds. Too few and poorly staffed concessions with excessive wait times. Avoid the hot dogs unless you like stale bread. Stadium directions poor and staff uninterested. Car parking not cheap and very disorganized at end of event. Sorry LA but stubhub makes you look like some backwater town.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnoW5598YU
30,Need to advise parking attendants about disability parking availability,"Parking attendants need to be trained about disabled parking and webpage should be updated. Attended Leicester v PSG game with person with disability. Entered parking area and was directed to parking area 8. Parked in handicap space and then proceeded to walk with handicapped person nearly 1/2 mile to enter stadium, walking passed empty handicap parking in parking area 6. Stadium was nice, good viewing lines, concession service was extremely slow for major stadium.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TK302015
20,Good stadium with AWFUL parking,"The StubHub Center is a wonderful stadium for watching soccer, with great sight-lines and decent concessions. The main issue with the StubHub center is its parking, which is atrocious. It's not unusual to spend 45min-1hr getting out of the parking lot after a game, despite the stadium seating only 25,000 people. Most of this is due to the incredibly poor way the StubHub staff handles the lots, forcing people to merge into single file lines, rather than opening multiple gates to relieve pressure. It can create a frustrating experience getting in and out of the stadium. Some of the parking is also close to a mile away from the Stadium.StubHub center also price-gouges. When parking in the lots off of Central Avenue for an LA Galaxy game, parking is usually $5-$10, but for the PSG vs Leicester City game, they charge $20 for the same lots for no good reason.If you can uber here, do it. Anything to avoid parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jonathanM1234567
30,Nice arena but parking is horrible,"I recently watched my brother in the CrossFit games. While the stadium is nice, I'd love to watch a soccer match there, the amenities are lacking in some respects.Food prices, forget about it.Water bottle filling stations. Nice!Parking is my biggest beef. Walked, as I measured it, 9/10ths of a mile to the entrance of the games from the parking lot. Closer lots were full. The distance was exaggerated by Crossfit using only one entrance, but even so, it was a long walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cheese_head_in_La
50,CrossFit games 2016,"I had the honor of working at this venue for the CrossFit games. And what a beautiful place is was. I was really impressed with the cleanliness of the facility and the ease of navigation. Parking was a breeze and there was never a point when you felt over welmed by the crowds even on Saturday night when there was 27k people in a small arena. It's a shame the games are changing venues next year, I am going to miss this place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlexanderfedericoIV
50,Really Cool Stadium,"We went here for the Crossfit games and we were really impressed. There was a lot of parking, the venue is very well maintained, and there were a lot of options for food and drinks. I would consider a box depending on the price and would love to see the LA Galaxy play here too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/powelj1

50,Great venue for LA Galaxy,"We are from the East Coast but this was our second time seeing the Galaxy play in StubHub Center. I really like the small intimate venue (compared to a giant American football stadium). They have a lot of fun extras, cool food venues, fun halftime entertainment. The small stadium feels so much more intimate and it is entertaining to hear all the supporter group cheers. Parking was $10 in the stadium lot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gcinptc
50,Pitch Pale concert,"Nice venue for concerts, soccer, tennis and track meets. Enjoy the free summer concerts they provide for the community.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BelindaS559
40,The Galaxy sometimes plays soccer here,"Had a chance to see a Galaxy soccer match so took a trip to the Stub Hub Center. We have not been to this place often, so like any sporting venue, you would be wise to talk to someone who knows the best way to negotiate the parking. I did notice that a number of early arrivers were able to park along Victoria on the north side of the Cal State Dominguez Hills campus, but we were too late for that and were also unable to purchase a parking pass in advance (a good idea) near the stadium. Other arterials are closed to street parking. So we had to make a long drive around the campus to Central and then south to an entry point to the campus parking lots. The fee was $5 which is a real bargain these days. The parking spots were about a half mile walk from the stadium so good for your daily exercise. Several vendors along the way were selling hot dogs.Entry into the stadium involved a security point, but otherwise was quick and near our west-facing seating area. Since the stadium is not too large, all the upper seats have a pretty good view of the field. Fortunately, there was a fog bank that covered the sun so we did not have to look into it as it was setting. Also, we were glad we brought jackets since the temperature was near 60 which was quite a drop from the mid-90s in the valleys. The benches are heavy aluminum so you might want to bring a cushion if you want some additional comfort. Food, as you might expect, is expensive ($11 for a cup of beer) and involves lines so you might want to make sure you eat well before coming.Unfortunately, the game was less than stellar and ended in a 0-0 score. Anticipating this we left a few minutes early and were able to avoid much of the congestion by driving north on Central to the 91 freeway.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GenoNorthridge_CA

50,Perfect example of a soccer stadium in the US,"Coming from Boston, where my Revolution play their home games in the cavernous Gillette Stadium, the StubHub! Center is what I want to see for my team in the near future. It is removed from the city center of LA, so driving is really the only way to get there - the one downside. But, once there, it's a fantastic stadium - seats a quite a few people, but it doesn't feel that big, and the sightlines are great from everywhere. For those sitting on the ends, keep in mind that they aren't stadium seats that you are sitting in, but rather benches. If you want a stadium seat, you'll have to pay a little more to sit on the wings. Concessions are priced on the higher side (what stadium isn't?), but I like how it's almost separated from the seats in it's own little area with ample seating area in a plaza away from the action on the field. Would definitely see another game here, no question.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aadams0715

40,A Nice Venue,"This is a nice venue to watch MLS games. Came here to see Steven Gerrard's first game with the LA Galaxy. Good viewing no matter where you are sitting. Staff were also very helpful. Plenty of food vendors located around the arena, with ample eating areas. There is also one souvenir store located on-site. However, regarding parking, allow yourself plenty of time to enter and exit any of the parking lots. Overall, Recommended!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mvillag
20,They Don't Understand How to Get People Parked,"I'm not sure about this place. I like how clean and well-lit it is, but that's it. The seating is numbered, but no way do people really fit, and the don't try to, so everyone is squished together. The food was tasty, but there weren't many options for food types: pizza and hot dogs is it! The worst part was the parking. After all the events they've held, and they still can't get people parked in a timely way. It' all down to a single lane...winding through CSUDH! It took 15 minutes to walk from the far reaches of the campus, only to discover that the actual facility parking lot was nowhere near full. They need to get organized.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GoodToGoGirl
40,Great Stadium and Atmosphere (now Stub Hub Center),"We saw LA Galaxy play here and the stadium was better than I thought it would be. The facilities, including the parking were great.

At least the Galaxy wins!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/feiden
40,Good concert and sports facility,"Very nice sports and concert facility. Good vision lines. Lots of bathroom facilities, no lines at any time when we were there. Lots of food service facilities; I waited about 30 seconds in line before I got to place my order.Access is problematic. Long lines of cars back up at the entrances, and there are only 4 lines of cars to pay a fairly steep $15 for parking. Exiting is also problematic as parts of the parking lot are restricted with K-rails to force traffic in particular directions.However, compared to the Coliseum, Dodger Stadium or the Rose Bowl, a breeze.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SoCalTraveler91356
50,AWESOME Venue!,"Can't wait to go back, what a great place to have a concert!

We sat at the top of the main section in front of the announcers box on the 50 yard line. There is a canopy that reachers out and provides shelter over the top rows of the side sections. So when it rained, we stayed dry. But overall the stadium is out in the elements- no umbrellas allowed so bring plastic ponchos. Great stadium for the championship game.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MariannE749
50,Excellent Facility,I've attended several games here and have always enjoyed them regardless of which section I was in. The stadium is intimate and well designed. There's not a bad seat in the place. The concourses are roomy enough even when it's a sell out. Bathroom lines can get long sometimes. Parking is easy in- not so easy out depending on where you are.

The stadium opened in 2003, making it one of the newest stadium in Southern California. As such, it is a well appointed, modern facility with plenty of amenities. The concourses are wide, bathrooms are plentiful and clean (troughs are conspicuously absent for you Dodgers fans), and concession stands are distributed throughout the stadium.The reason my wife and I love visiting the HDC, other than obviously watching our beloved Galaxy play, is that it's easily accessible from three major freeways, and it's not in the heart of Downtown LA. Coming from Orange County, it's a quick trip down the 91 freeway. Parking is expensive ($15), but the parking lot is easy-in, easy-out; unlike Dodger Stadium's barely orchestrated chaos.As a soccer (football) fan, the HDC is a must visit stadium. It was one of the first professional soccer-specific stadiums in the country. Whether you're visiting SoCal or you live here, go catch a game. You'll have a great time while supporting local soccer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ianbob
50,My Favorite SoCal Stadium!,"I love this venue! I've been to many Galaxy and US National Team games here and it can be said there's not a bad seat in the house (I've sat in most sections, and in luxury boxes, and on the berm). The stadium was designed to be intimate and to keep the fans close to the action and I think they succeeded.There are some small negatives regarding the speed and cost of food service, but I think that's a problem at every stadium.We once had an issue with a different and dangerous traffic flow out of the parking lot after a game. I emailed the management and they were very responsive to our concerns and complaints. I was impressed with their attention to the problem.All in all, it's a great place to see a game!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cadmapper
50,Fans Stadium,Fan Friendly Stadium! Who ever designed this wanted the fans to have great views of the action!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Giovanni392
50,Home to the LA Galaxy!!!,"Love love love it here!have been here plently of times...huge soccer family and this is an awesome stadium, unless you end up with grass seating which equals not so good of a view...The only down side is having 2 teams share a home field, but I guess that's not a trip advisor issue!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SBSCSoccerMom
40,Great soccer stadium.,I would suggest you attend at least one Galaxy game here. Good atmosphere.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dmas6
50,MLS FINALS,"first time to HDC, went for the MLS finals. Excellant facilty, great staff, great atmosphere ! One of the best sporting eents I have eve been to, and I have been to 100's if not 1000's. Field was in decent condition even with the all day rain. RAIN???? in LA??? oh well, didn't dampen the crowd or my enthusiasm.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/socrog
50,Simply put - WOW!!!!!,"We recently returned from a trip to Southern California with our 3 kids and decided to check and see if the Galaxy would be in town while we were there. They were, and I contacted Kevin, one of the Galaxy staff, for assistance with a question regarding a ticket promotion that was done a few months ago (found on a google search). Although they were done with that promo, Kevin was able to help me get some discounted tickets, e-mailed and called me with detailed information regarding the various seats, and eventually helped get the tickets to me at the last minute so we would have them in time for our trip. Kevin was AWESOME and I was so impressed with the service I got from him.Game day was even better. First of all, our seats were great - we were directly behind the goal about 6 rows up and had a great view of the action. We were right by the tunnel where the players come out so my sons got a kick out of seeing the players up-close and personal. They wanted to get autographs, but no luck - not a big deal. They set off fireworks during the national anthem, which was very cool. I cannot say enough good things about the fans at this game! I have never attended an athletic event where the fans were so courteous and NOT obnoxious! Everyone was having a great time, but they were very respectful and not once did I have to worry about some drunk person yelling out expletives the entire game. The stadium was immaculate - from the bathrooms to the bleachers themselves, everything was very clean. Parking was extremely organized and we directed right to a parking space. Getting out after the game took a little while, but you expect that after a game. While we walked to our seats in the stadium, the ushers working in the concourse greeted us as we walked by, welcoming us to the Home Depot Center. Very nice touch, in my opinion. All in all, this was probably the highlight of our trip. The weather was beautiful and the game was so enjoyable (even though the Galaxy lost).To my surprise and amazement, I received a phone call from Kevin the day after the game. He just wanted to check in and see if we enjoyed the game, our seats, and if we had any feedback regarding their organization. WOW - talk about great customer service!! Usually with any type of sporting event, you purchase your tickets online, find your seats at the game and leave at the end, potentially never having any interaction with the staff at the arena unless you can't find your seat or purchase something from a food vendor.Bottom line - the LA GALAXY are a top-notch, high-class organization. I only wished we lived in California so we could get season tickets or at least attend more games. I highly recommend attending an LA GALAXY game - even if you're not a soccer fan. It is great fun and I'm sure you'll leave very impressed!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LALA0123
50,Highlight of our trip to LA and we got to see David beckham,"I booked tickets to see LA Galaxy last October time, brilliant time and we got to see david Beckham, We got there early to see the players train a wonderful experience. Im not into Football but loved it! Go Go Go",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thrahtobe
