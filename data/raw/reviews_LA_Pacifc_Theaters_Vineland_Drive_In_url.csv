50,Quite an experience!,"My boyfriend and I had recently moved to California when we heard from our landlord that we just *had* to see a drive-in movie at this theater. We were there to see one of the Star Wars movies. Overall, it was a great experience! It was rather nice to have our own little space, rather than a crowded theater with a bunch of strangers. We decided to bring our own movie snacks and drinks, but they did offer a concession stand if anyone just has to have freshly popped popcorn at the movies!",Lizzy
10,Drive in,Ugly old and ghetto!!! Even in the daytime when it's a swap meet it's ugly old and ghetto!!! Not as much fun as I thought it would be!!! So disappointed!!!,wendycvelez
30,Fun with kids,"The screen is an okay size, they def pack in a lot of folks because drive ins are not common. Could use some T&L but it works and if u bring things to make the experience comfortable, it's an enjoyable experience.",OrangeCountyJay
30,"Not the Best, Not the Worst...","This establishment charges by the person, not the vehicle. The audio is via FM. Screens are smaller. Snack bar is overpriced. However, all of this can be attributed to being in Los Angeles. The movie selections are not too dated. In this age is fewer drive-in theaters, deal with the imperfections and enjoy this dying icon of outdoor cinema.",Netwalker2k15
10,Dangerous and not fun,"Please avoid this place. The day we visited we noticed a lot of odd things going on (some don't even seem legal). There seems to be a negative atmosphere Going on, and very unhappy people selling few items. It seems that most people just sell real junk, and Im not talking about old stuff. We encounter a row of sellers chanting asking a group of buyers to leave the area, just for asking questions. Then we notice a sales man chasing another family yelling and arguing about his great prices. To me this please does not feel like a family friendly place. If you are going to go walk there be cautious, there is no security around like in other places either. Stay away and be safe. There a lots of other swap meets near by and you don't see any of this stuff.",lxjuarez
50,Great time on vacation,We were hesitant after reading reviews that this was a bad part of town but we went and didn't get that vibe. There was a Maserati and all kinds of crazy nice cars. We didn't get any bad vibes either. It was priced affordably and we liked it a lot.,Lovecruising04
40,An open drive in!,"I found this place while looking up random things on Google searches, and was honestly surprised to see that there were still drive in movie theatres open! My husband and family occasionally make the drive to this theatre when they have something decent playing. You can't go wrong with tickets $4 or so cheaper than a sit down theatre for 2 flicks, plus you can bring in your own food -- they do have an open concession stand too. They play movies that were out previously but not too old, so it's a nice way to catch something you may have missed.",irishsiren32
50,excellent fun,this is the first drive-in I have ever been to. I really enjoyed this we bought a giant drink and popcorn and then sat in the cr to enjoy the film. The screen was clear and the sound comes out of your FM radio. There is no reason to buy any food there is no restriction on you brining in your own food. The parking bays were plenty big enough and they raise the front of your car up to make the viewing easier. If you have never done this before I can not recommend it enough as a cheap really enjoyable night out,justin c
50,Cheap!,"Cheap tickets, you can bring your own food and drinks (non alcoholic), you get to see a double feature, what more do you want? The snack bar is available but expensive. Great for families. You can bring your own lawn chairs and just sit right outside you car. The restrooms are a bit dirty though.",cloudb310
40,Great movie experience with occasional train interruptions,"We really enjoyed our trip to the drive in, though the lights in nearby lots and the occasional passing train detracted from the experience. Overall recommended for the change of pace from seeing a move in the theater, great selection of movies, and good deal for a double feature.",Amanda H
10,By far the worst of the main three Drive- theaters in So Cal,This drive-in is by far the worst of the three drive-in theaters in Southern California. First it is a horrible part of town. You are put off way in a ghetto feel area where I was more afraid of getting car jacked or stabbed in the snack bar than enjoying the movie. heck if I'd let my girls walk to the bathroom by their self. During the movie a group of 5 cars of what seemed like gang bangers pulled up and chased several cars out of their spot so they could all park together and continued to be loud and drink beer throughout the night. Second the sound quality was horrible. half the people couldn't even pick up the station without large amounts of static or even at all. A couple people will dial radios could focus in so we had to turn our radio off completely to listen in on others pick-up. Third the smell of trash and beer was awful from the swap meet earlier in the day. It was so overpowering that forget snack time. Then you have the constant trains going by from trains and metro-link..The Drive-ins in Montclair and Riverside are much nicer and both of those have digital picture and audio. Do yourself a favor and go two those two and save your night and possibly your life...,Michael S
40,Good Old Summer Time Fun,Love going to the drive-in!!! Always make a fun night of it. Make dinner and snacks and go to the drive in for the night. Bring a couple adult beverages and a few friends and its a party. Cheap and fun way to spend a summer night with friends or with you loved. The facilities are run down and the snack bar is terrible but who cares when you are sitting in your car and eating some good food you brought and drinks that don't cost $100 a person. They allow you to move from screen to screen so you can watch all the movies you want till they close which is nice.,Alan D
40,"Simple, Cheap and do your own things","If you have been to the Drive-In Move before then you know the deal...this is a good set up. If you never been before then you are in for a treat! Make sure you park up the hill. Make sure you bring plenty of food and drinks. The concessions stand is weak. Also, the Metro Link Train and Freight trains come by every 20 or 30 minutes so be prepared for this. yes, the movie starts a little after dusk. During the week, it is slow. This is a good deal and big lot! Two Movies for the price of one or possibly three if you know how to work the system on Friday/Saturday. bring some lawn chairs if the weather is nice",jdreynoldsjr
40,"Fun blast to the past, bring food and kiddos in PJs","This is a fun place to take your kids for a blast to the past. A lot of people bring lawn chairs and sit outside of their cars and bring their own food. We found that the sound coming through our radio (you tune in to a frequency to hear the movie) had static, so we just turned it off and listened to the sound of everyone else's radio. Kids came in their pajamas and it made for a memorable summer evening. Will definitely come back.",akfs
