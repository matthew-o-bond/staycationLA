So far our personal attachment. But there is more:One of the highlights: The Tokens (""The Lion sleeps tonight""), a legend! Traditionally, Uta Graf's ballett school presents ""The Nutcracker"", great talents, very professional!We just saw the ""Fiddler on the Roof"", great performance, worth seeing!The Norris Theater persistently brings first class entertainment to the neighborhood.Thank you!",Ulrike Z

50,Best in the South Bay,"Year after year, the Norris Theater provides the South Bay with a broad range of performances of professional quality in all the Performing Arts. Given the location and the relatively small number of seats, it cannot compete for 'high budget' productions that play 'uptown' (Music Center, Pantages, Wadsworth, etc.), but they constantly offer what is possible to the residents of the South Bay without the time and aggravation too often associated with freeway trips to Westwood or Hollywood or downtown LA. It is remarkable to find so satisfying an experience so close to home .. everything from first class chamber music to one-man or small cast shows by 'known' actors to competent ballet and dance companies. It should be understood that this is not a resident company house, but is a professional 'roadhouse' which books what is available and affordable in a well designed and outfitted professional level building with good acoustics and exemplary seating and sight lines. Go.",PVtalker

50,Norris the Great!,"My husband and I travel from Santa Barbara for theatre at the Norris Center for the Performing Arts. ""Every"" theatre production that we have attended has been top quality and that is what keeps us coming back. (Of course we do visit with the kid when we come to town.)Last Saturdays concert On The Border, the Ultimate Eagle Tribute was wonderful. It was great fun. Those of us up in the balcony were swinging with the music.Thank you Norris for the great opportunity. We really enjoy the theatre and loved that concert.",debnpaulo
50,The Producers,"One of the best performances we have seen anywhere...all performers were outstanding but the leads were truly exceptional. We laughed, we smiled and truly enjoyed. We would recommend this theater. I don't think there was a bad seat in the house. What a great show!!!",Joan M
20,Community theater NOT a CTR for the Perf. Arts,"with onstage introductions to a local real estate agent and other commercials...this is definately NOT a ""center for the performing arts"" as the orange county center for the performing arts IS...for instance! we saw ""guys & dolls"" and there were 3 talented cast members...adelaide, nathan & a chorus boy. the rest were pretty ""high school"". not worth the freeway traffic AT ALL.",brewsterstravels
