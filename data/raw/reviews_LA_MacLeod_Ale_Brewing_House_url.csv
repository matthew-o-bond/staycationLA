40,Great craft brewery,"Fun little place with dozens of craft beer on tap, including some cask ales that were delicious. Laid-back atmosphere; family friendly--sit and play some board games while sipping a brew. They also have pizza (apparently a new thing), but we jsut stopped in for the beers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaryKop
50,Good Craft Beer and Pizza,"MacLeod's offers a wide selection of cask-conditioned, hand-drawn beers and ales, along with a few guest taps. Recently, they added pizza and salads--both are excellent. The list of available beers rotates frequently. The ambiance is modern garage, a roughed out space with lots of concrete. They also have a darts room. Good place to hang out and enjoy a few beers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaxG583
50,Very Cool Place,"They say they are the second biggest brewery in Van Nuys. Pretty funny if you think about it. They have about 19 taps including 3 beer engines for their cask ale. Usually, when I visit a brewpub there beers that I don't care for. Here, I liked them all. The cask offerings were especially nice. They only had a couple of IPA's and they were not cloudy. HOORAY and cheers, I hope that fad goes away. Bar staff was very beer knowledgeable. No glitter beers here just some good solid, to-style selections. Wish I lived near this place, it would be my local. Parking is ABSOLUTELY terrible. Take an Uber.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/467ChrisB

40,Local Brewery!!,"One of our only local breweries. They have games, food trucks, great beer, and a piggy!! Great for gathering with friends on the weekends and evenings. Only downside is the parking (lack of much of it). But nothing we're not use to in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/uniqueqt22
50,Craft Beer & Fun,"I have read so many reviews and or seen comments about this place, so I finally checked it out. It's located in an industrial area of Van Nuys. Parking can be difficult but worth it. Very friendly and helpful staff, including the owner. The customers there also are friendly and very sociable. They only serve their own craft beers made right there in the same room as the bar. This place is listed as a tasting room, therefore they do allow children, and they have a different food truck there every evening. Limited hours that they are open, 5 pm to 10 pm week days, noon to 10 pm on the weekends. Large dart room. Very nice group of people that appear to be regulars here. If you're into the craft beer experience, this place is fun to try, you'll like the ales and the people that frequent this place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/richardsC7805SY
50,Great beer,"We came here on a whim and we had a great time. We tried a number of great beers and we took a growler home to share with others. The location is nothing special but there's are some artistic touches that make you forget you are in a working brewery. Also, the buy someone a beer wall makes for a great way to get people to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BOBBYGHollywood
40,Good Beer,Came to California for a visit to see my cousin and she recommended we go here. When I was in Cali last in 2010 there weren't many brew places around. I was not disappointed. The food truck there that evening was good as well. Will be back again on my next visit to California.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joegluv
50,Amazing UK Brewery in the middle of San Fernando Valley,"Popped in to this place for a taste of home after being informed by a mate of mine. Tucked into a warehouse space on an unassuming side street I was pleasantly surprised. the staff was friendly, the place was packed, there was a great vibe and best of all the Ales were fantastic. Loved every single one I tried. They have a food truck that comes and sets up out front as well which is always a treat. Additionally they are ride off the Orange Line Metro Bike path which makes it a perfect stop on those long rides. They've started selling their beer in several pubs around LA however you can still get a Growler fill for a reasonable price. A True Gem! I will be frequenting regularly",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shaggylom
40,"One of a Kind Microbrewery for Cask Conditioned Ale, British Style","We went on a Wednesday night and found a traditional no frillsBritish brew pub tucked away in a warehouse on a dark nonresidentialstreet in Van Nuys. The place was packed! Seating is limited to the bar,some high chairs and a few tables of low chairs. On this night there wasa large unlikely knitting circle at one of the large low tables, and a knittingtruck out front. You can find some food at a food truck out front (next tothe knitting truck) or all the peanuts you can eat (just throw the shellson the floor) or packages of crackers (for the cheese that you bring).You can bring your own food of any kind but if you do, be preparedto bring everything you need to eat it.The focus here is the traditionally brewed ale that comes in varyingcolors and flavors. You can buy them in a pint, a half pint or a sampler.They also have growlers, containers for take-away. The ale is servedat a British temperature and has no added carbonation. You're gettingthe real deal here and you'll meet ex-pat Brits, anglophiles and otherale lovers. There are non-alcoholic sodas for the nondrinker in your party.If you've never been to the UK and want to try traditional ale,this is your place.At least during these winter months you'll want to bring a jacket.It's a warehouse so the whole front rolls up like a garage doorand it can get chilly -- at least until you put away a few pints!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HuntressCA
