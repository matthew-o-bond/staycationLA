40,good public course,"We've played this course for many years and seen many changes. The management of the course was recently changed, and it is going through a transition. For example, the pro shop is basically empty, with very few items to purchase. The starter arrangement has changed and it now takes a bit longer to get checked in and get a cart. The course itself is in OK condition now, after all the rain this winter, but many of the trees have been removed due to the draught. The course is well maintained and fun to play - and so we continue to come back. With a county card, it is very reasonably priced.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/socal13
