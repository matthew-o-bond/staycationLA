The food choices are tremendous and include a number of casual eateries such as Mendocino Foods, North Italia, and others.

There is plenty of free parking.",Paul E
50,"Fine restaurants, nice shoops","I like this place because is small, clean and with a lot of trees. There´s even well-treated grass to take your children to play. A lot of restaurants to choose, from vegan to Italian, from burgers to salads. There is a Lucky Bran store, a Madewell and even a face spa. There is plenty of park space and just around the corner, you have another store center with a Max Mara and a Banana Republic store. So either is for a family lunch or a business one, we will find plenty of restaurants to choose from and even have some spare time to shoop. Don´t we love it, girls?",gmorgado

50,"It is a very diversified spot to bring kids as well as your ""best friend"".","Every spot we have chosen to dine has been VERY good. Thee Point offers such a variety of meals, so EVERYONE should be happy with their choices. The outside dining is a HUGE plus here in the South Bay. Living here you enjoy being outside and so many restaurants do not offer that opportunity. We haven't tried all of the eateries yet....but we will!",Dimples22

40,Shopping malls and shopping malls,"Shopping malls and shopping malls. That is another word for Sepulveda Boulevard. I imagine it as a linear conglomeration of shops.
