40,Fun Hike at a Busy place over the Hills,"Very close to Monrovia and Arcadia, this place is perfect for weekend hiking. Not very difficult tracks and goes from rocky to fairly dense bushes. We went for the Hermit falls Trail, which went down pretty sharply in the woods down to the river bed. We had to cross the pebble river and then hike up the rocks to reach the falls.There is a nice place to enjoy water at the end of the walk. We went on a pretty hot day but amazed to see the rush of people over the hills. Someplace we experienced long wait to let people pass by in the narrow stretches of the trail. Our car had to be parked on the approach road to this place.There are old cottages along the route and have some good places to have a picnic. It is important to carry enough water or hydration as the dry weather can lead to cramps. There are no places for filling up bottles. However please do not leave away trash in the process.Overall its a nice outing which needs to improve and accommodate such number people during weekends or holidays.",Aninda_mukherjee
40,Escape to the woods,"Did the Santa Anita loop 9.5 miles. Well shaded with some rest areas along the way. Got to glimpse a Bobcat, Sturtevent falls was a trickle, but the overall scenery is great. Trail goes down then up, down and up again through several canyons and up to Mt Zion. Enjoyed the escape from the urban jungle to this beautiful historical place. Go early for parking or you may not get a spot!",mojorayjones
40,Scenic and Fun Hike !,Nice and scenic hike! Lots of giant boulders. Fun to watch people do the cliff diving near the end of the trail. Dirt path was a little narrow at places but it's a dog friendly trail as well. Eating place and restrooms across the street from main trail head. Recommended.,MandC0218
50,BEST KEPT SECRET only minutes from Downtown LA!,"BEST HIKE EVER!! Today we explored one of LA's best hidden treasures which was only a 50 minute drive from my home in Hollywood. While the water is still flowing from all the rain we received this season, you must visit Sturtevant Falls located on a breathtaking hike in Santa Anita Canyon.I heard about the falls a couple years ago and wanted to visit but it has been dry due to the drought. Now it is fast flowing and gorgeous. There are old cabins built from 1909-1920's dotted throughout the hike. It feels like an old homestead and a good hide away for Frodo Baggot.The hike all together is 8.5 miles (round trip) but that is if you explore ALL of the trails and falls. We only hiked to Sturtevant Falls which is a 3.6 mile hike round trip. We plan on going back and explore the others falls and trails.If you go, here are some tips:-Wear good hiking shoes that can get wet (Merrels/Keens/Tevas).-Plan a full day and bring snacks or lunch. Lunch if you do the full hike.-Pack a towel if you want to get in the falls.-The hike is dog friendly. We took our pup!-You will stop many times because there is so much to see including the signs with memorable quotes. See photos!-Stay Hydrated! We saw a man on the ground with full on cramps.-Please do not leave your trash. There wasn't much but we took a bag and picked up other peoples trash.",Sage Skye
50,Big Santa Anita Canyon,Nice place to be alone or with friends since the air is very nice and very quiet. Be sure to pack extra socks if you get your shoes wet since you have to pass some streams and such. Highly recommend to go as early as possible because walking back up is real hard. Really pretty abandoned houses and scenery !,Mitchliona
40,"Many, many options!","I go there often and have been for several years. Choices are...short to long, easy to strenuous, out & back or loops... You can just go for an hour or two or make it a daylong hike/run. Camping is another option and there are campsites to renting cabins. The only downside is parking. If you don't get there early (on weekends), you may end up adding another 1 to 2+ miles just to get to the entrance.",SPedder118
40,Sturtevant Falls,"I finally got to hike with my 10 year old daughter for the first time. This hike is perfect for families and kids. The area is beautiful and the trail itself is pretty flat. The only hard part is the .6 miles at the end of the hike when you need to get back to the trailhead. It has a very serious grade, just be prepared to take your time if you are a beginner or if you are with young children. Tips: Bring $5 cash for a daily parking permit you can get at the trailhead OR you can buy a yearly pass that cost $30 and that can be used in almost all of Southern California Mountains, it's called a Wilderness Permit and you can pick that up at any sporting good store or ranger station. Parking SUCKS. Be prepared to add about a mile to your hike and try to park OFF the road. I saw people with their front end and back ends in the street which could end up in a ticket or worse an accident. Check out my blog about the whole hike with pictures and links to trailheads.

50,Awesome!!! Make sure you go here!,"This is a great place to hike with lots of different levels of hiking, from easy to challenging. There was a nice water fall today - Sturtevant Falls- due to some rain during the week, so it was really pretty. The hike to the falls was fairly easy , but we also hiked above the falls and that was a little more challenging. Very narrow rocky trails with very steep drop-offs. You really had to be careful and watch where you were going. It was is the forest most of the time, so shaded and really pretty. Make sure you take plenty of water and maybe even some snacks. You also have to have a parking pass which can be purchased at the pack station. Scattered along the trail are quite a few old and really cool cabins built of stone and wood that are available for rent. It was nice to see the quaint structures sitting among the beauty of the forrest. The hike out of the canyon was probably the most challenging, as it is all up hill and a fairly steep incline!",Cinda10
50,Hike away to your heart's desire!,"This is my absolute favorite canyon in Southern California. There are many hiking trail choices here which make it great for young children as well as advanced hikers. If taking children, a 3.25 mile out and back hike to Sturtevant Falls will be a treat for all as you hike the well shaded canyon. You will pass privately owned historical cabins that compliment the scenery and remind you of an era long gone. Beware of the small flies that are prevalent during summer months and be sure to take insect repellant. For those who like more of a challenge, you can continue to do a 10 mile loop hike or hike all the way to Mount Wilson (very strenuous). The best part of this canyon is that it is heavily shaded throughout. If doing the loop, take sunscreen as there are some sunny parts. Good hiking shoes are always recommended. Lastly, you'll need a $5 adventure pass which can be purchased at the pack station otherwise you could be cited for not having one. If going on the weekend, go before 8 am for decent parking.",Caroline L
50,Nice hiking trail!,"It s worth drive to this trail. Another name for this trail is Sturtevant fall.- you won't find it if entering either name. Put Chantry Flats on gps. This will take you up to Santa Anita Canyon road. Go about 3 miles on a winding road.- go to the Adam's pack station, where you can buy the pass for $5 to place on your car window if parking on the road. Or park at the Adam's pack station for $10 (including pass).- there are several trails. For first timer, Sturtevant fall is most popular trail.- 4 miles with paved road at the beginning of the trail and down hills. There are plenty of shade and photo ops on this trail.- there are several cabins along the trail built in 1900's. These are for rent. You can rent these at pack station or go online airbnb.com or amdamspackstation.com.- there are water stream and dams along the hike.- crossing 2 water rock beds, you will get to the water fall.- bring plenty of water and a fun company- the way back can be rough at the last mile up hill.- if you hike late hours close to sunset, might want to bring insect repellant.- it is family and dog friendly hike. It is a great hike to do with your chuldren. We met many family with small children and dogs along this trail.- the water fall is not roaring since there has been drought the last few years!",kukulimoku
50,A family trek to Big Santa Anita Canyon,"Family members met in East Pasadena for a very early breakfast at a Denny's hoping to arrive at Chantry Flats early enough to get parking spaces . The parking lot was full & we had to park along the road .We were commemorating the 100th anniversary of the building of a family cabin in the canyon . Its still standing & being used ! The present owner graciously met us there & we had a tour of the old cabin .The weather was agreeable & I made the round trip hike in & out of the canyon with no problem despite my age . Pretty good for a 75 yrs, old !",Dolores K
40,Shaded Hiking Trails,"Started the hike at Chantry Flat took the Upper Winter Creek Trail to the Manzanita Trail and continued onto the Mount Wilson trail to the summit. We returned the same way.The parking lot at Chantry Flat gets full early on the weekends! If you come after 8 am you will be parking on the side of the road. We parked .5 miles from the lot but on the drive back saw cars parked 1.5 miles down. Be prepared for a prehike if you are starting later. An Adventure Pass is necessary. Adam's Pack Shop near the parking lot sells Adventure Passes as well as meals, snacks, various beverages, and maps. Debit/Credit Card transactions have a $2 fee if under $10 dollars. The nicer bathrooms are available near the picnic area. The trails for the most parts are shaded, very narrow and some parts the trail is just rocks. Upper Winter Creek trail has some up and downs though you overall climb. Once you pick up the Manzanita Trail beware the poison oak, it grows abundabtly beside the trail. It is 4.25 miles from here to the top of Mount Wilson and there is no water or restrooms along the way. Hoegee's campground is about 0.33 miles from the junction where you pick up Manzanita. Restrooms are available at the campground however they were closed when I went. The Mount Wilson trail joins the Mount Wilson toll road, this is a wider dirt road, for a bit. You can continue on the dirt road to the summit but the real trail is off to the right. This split is NOT well marked, you have to pay close attention to the right side of the road for the split.Overall the top of Mount Wilson can be dissapointing, there is no large sign announcing you have reached the top of a 5710 foot mountain. Restrooms are available as well as a water fountain. The restrooms were once again closed when I went. Overall the hike is about 7.25 miles from the parking lot to summit, 14.5 miles roundtrip. This trail can be difficult, trail runners or hiking boots recommended. Bring sufficient water especially if hiking if it is warmer weather. Bring sufficient snacks, there is a cafe at the summit but it is open only during certain months and times. Lastly know your limits, cell phone service is spotty at best and wildlife is abundant, plan sufficient time to complete your hike during daylight hours.",ShalymarL
50,Great sights beautiful view of Los Angeles from the top,This place is a nice place to get closer to nature. We took the trail to mount Wilson which is a 7 mile hike .Bring comfortable footwwar to avoid getting foot blisters.Also pack plenty of water as during your hike there are no water fountain. You must display a parking pass which you can purchase for $5 at the ranger's office.,Yael47
40,One the the more shadier hikes in SoCal.,"This hike is best on a weekday as is does get busy (and the parking lot gets full). Best to go early as possible. The trail to Sturtevant Falls is very scenic with a creek and old family owned cabins along the way. The beginning of the trail is very steep, thus returning is a hike up so you may need to stop a few times to catch your break. Be sure to get your Forest Adventure Pass from REI or Sports Chalet or be prepared to pay 5 bucks for day use/parking. A hiking pole or two will be helpful on this hike to the falls. The falls are less full during late summer. There are snacks available, but not on Mondays.",CyndeesOffTheCouch
50,"Thank you, Wilbur!","This review specifically for Gabrielino Trail to Sturtevant Falls. Very popular so emphasis on following: Go EARLY or try weekday; display Adventure Pass; bring water; expect to share falls with everyone!On weekends, Chantry Flats parking lot fills by 6:15am! Decent restrooms available in upper lot. If late, park along curved road inside lines, or expect a ticket. A dog friendly trail with average gain of 700 ft and 4-5 miles (depending on where parked). Tips: rocks can be loose and slippery on stream crossings so poles helpful; watch out for poison oak; the workout is .6 mile uphill to parking lot!Wilbur M. Sturtevant carved this trail in the 1890's and for that, we thank you! A lush forest only minutes away from LA...so worth it!",Shimadog
40,Great place for a hike - just watch out for the crowds,"This is a great place for a hike but due to its proximity to Pasadena, Glendale it can get packed on the weekends. Either get there real early or mid to late afternoon in the spring \ autumn months to enjoy a less crowed experience.",Steve L
40,Beautiful hikes in wooded Southern California canyon,"Although one gets hit up for the wonderful National Forest Adventure Pass fee, the hikes in Big Santa Anita Canyon are beautiful and cool, except on the hottest days of summer and fall. Sturtevant Falls is a 2 1/2 mile hike, first down and then moderately up. There is a beautiful pool under the falls in a wooded canyon. The last 1/2 mile of the return trip is steep. Fortunately Adams Pack Station is at the top with a full fridge of cold drinks. I recommend it as an outing, especially if you can go during the week. The weekends are crowded.",Waldorf2012
40,Perfect urban oasis,"Right in the heart of the city, this is a beautiful, peaceful and easily accessible walk in the woods. Great for families too. So lovely.",Pat M
50,Big Santa canyon review,"There is a nice loop trail, it is about three to four miles long, but the trail has many trees make this trail very beautiful and easy to walk. the half of this trail is along side the creek, it is shade and cool during the summer time .",chien C
50,Beautiful scenes!!,It is an awesome place for the whole family and animals my baby luna loved the water and the waterfall,Jfau B
40,Great for getting back to nature!,"always changing with the seasons; good trails, close to city but you'd never know it. Great get-away for anyone.",cvcalifornia
50,great fall colors,one of the perfect hikes.hike in shades of sycamore trees.colorful leaves all over.hike to sturvent fall.,travel53
50,"Beautiful hike with lots of creek and stones, and waterfalls!","Sturtevant Falls is located in Santa Anita CA and is a beautiful hike. You'll walk down and up instead of the usual hike up and down a mountain.Once you get deep inside, it feels like a real forest. The path varies from very wide to almost non-existent to stepping over stones on the creek.The end is the best: a beautiful waterfall with crystal clear water. The worst part is the hike back up on the asphalt with no shade--definitely try to go when there's not too much sun.",typome
