50,Amazing Small Club Venue! Parking easy within 1 block,Was blessed to be able to see The Longshot there. This is an intimate space that holds 500-600. It has an elevated stage which is nice because there really wasn't a bad view. Sound quality was excellent. Bathrooms were clean for a club this size as well and easily accessible. Would love to see another show there if I am ever back in the area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M-P-E-06
40,A Great Venue to see an Intimate Show!,"I went with my teenage sons to see The Regrettes in late June. We had tickets in advance so we weren’t worried about the line that formed early along 7th Street. We parked directly across the street for $15. I’m always willing to pay a little more for convenience and safety, especially in the big cities. Having said that, I didn’t feel unsafe, even walking back from a Mexican restaurant up on Wilshire. There were also a few food trucks and street food vendors close by.The venue was smaller than I expected from some of the pics I had seen online. This is perfect, though, if you want an intimate show with the opportunity to get right up by the stage. There is a cafe inside where you can get some coffee and grub. There are also a couple of convenient bars inside and they will check your ID at the door to give you a wristband if you are drinking. Security seemed to be random at the door. My one son and I walked right in, but my other son was asked to empty his pockets.Overall it’s a cool place to see a concert, almost in the shadows of the Los Angeles skyscrapers. One minor complaint was the heavy-handed security. I’m sure it’s necessary at times but there were mostly teens there from what I could tell. The merchandise line was right at the entryway and obviously people will congregate there to meet the bands. They kept screaming at people to keep the walkway clear. Maybe they should put the merchandise table elsewhere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D9447PXjohns
50,Great location to hear new music,I have been there a few times and always a great atmosphere to listen to new music. There are a couple bars in the front on the left and right as you enter so you can sit and enjoy a drink or something to munch on prior to the show,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pda575
20,No passion,"I was there for a drink, staff only focused on money, fast, few people and expecially very LA style (I was looking for a local place).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/The-Winston-Smith84
50,Loved it,Really awesome venue that is well cooled even when it’s jam packed. Bathrooms are clean and well stocked. Stage it’s great. You can stand at the artists feet. There is a bar in the lobby area and one in the stage area at the back. The lobby bar sells small food items.There is an ATM in the front lobby which is great because if you are going to buy merch you need cash. No debit which is a bummer. Get a square card reader already!!!Audio and acoustics are great here. Anyone controlling sound behind the scenes knows what they are doing.Would go again. Something almost every night to see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nalbrecht12
50,Nikka Costa live,Saw thus wonderful artist and could nearly touch her. So amazing to be in such an intimate venue. Sound was spectacular. Waited in the bar out the front to friendly staff. Great experience in the gritty city. Wonderful venue.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carolynp24
50,Pretty New and Pretty Great,"Saw Patti Smith here in early April. A fairly new venue for music in LA, though the building itself is over 100 years old. Originally a silent movie theater that's been very nicely refurbished with great sound, three separate bars and an adjacent restaurant. Parking is available for $15 directly across the street, or you may find some free street parking if you arrive early enough. This is a standing room only facility, but even at a sold out show there's plenty of space if your away from the stage itself. Reasonably priced drinks (for LA) and good service make this an enjoyable experience. If you have any interest in bands that may play there, check it out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JCruickshank
40,Great Concert Venue,Went here last week to see a great performance. The venue is small which makes it awesome to see great live music. The location was easy to find and the bar and everything were great! No complaints. Typical general admission venue but has a nice feel to it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/62michelek
50,Concert venue,Saw Railroad Earth here and loved the venue and the vibe! Checked out their calendar and bought tickets for another show coming up!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/701allegrac
50,Cherry Glazerr (02-16-2017),"This was my first visit to The Teragram Ballroom in Downtown Los Angeles. I came here to see an up-and-coming local Alternative Rock group ""Cherry Glazerr"" that's getting national attention (An all ages concert sponsored by KCRW 89.9). KCRW's 'Morning Becomes Eclectic' host Jason Bentley interviewed ""Cherry Glazerr"" on MBE the day before and he praised Teragram as 'One of The BEST Music Venues Around"". Bentley was 'Spot On'. I got there real early, as I wanted to check out the area and find ample parking - I was sorta lucky to find street parking off 7th Street (But, I didn't have enough change for the duration of meter, just enough to get 20 mins of time and I was just 15 mins from meter expiration (6pm). I ran out of time - so, I walked out of my car to the liquor store right next to my parking spot to get change. Lo and behold - two mins later, a LAPD meter maid ticketed my car $63- so, fair warning - please carry lots of change in your car). I found out later there was a parking lot right across the street from front entrance - $15 (I will use the lot next time). The staff and security were quite friendly (HI to Jay and Vanessa, very sweet people) I was provided a chair to sit due to a bad knee from my sporting past, as Teragram is primarily 'Standing Room' only location like other ballrooms from the past. It's amazing to see the talent that play here, from Alternative, Eclectic Rock to Pop acts. The Ballroom has a historical feel to it, and I enjoyed how the hall filled up to the brim by time the headline act came on stage just before 10pm. It's way smaller than The Troubadour in WeHo and the guy who checked the people coming in throughout the night told me it can hold as many as 625 people. It was a sold out show (as most Teragram shows are - so, get yer tickets early). This concert consisted of two opening acts and 'Cherry Glazerr'. The opening act Jerry Paper was a interesting 'oddball' group singing odd songs featuring 'odd cartoon characters' but they also performed a Steely Dan Classic ""Only A Fool Would Say That"" that I liked. The second act was a more cutting edge Alt-Roots group called ""Slow Hollows"" which I actually enjoyed. They had a sound quite familiar to ""Bon Iver"" with a trumpet player - and this bear enjoyed the vibe this young local group was able to deliver. Around 10pm the headline act crashed onto the stage - and as I expected ""Cherry Glazerr"" did not disappoint me at all. I was pretty close to the stage, and the sea of folks younger than me just rocking out was so enlightening (The audience was primarily under 30, as I felt I was one of only a handful of people in the crowd between 40 and 50) But, that didn't stop me from having a great time and meeting some fine people as well. Witnessing ""Cherry Glazerr"" at Teragram was worth the traffic, the parking ticket and not having a timely dinner. I would do it again (minus the parking ticket) - FIVE CLAWS UP!!!!! Gay Friendly. Cal Bear Friendly (I Met an alumna - UCB Class of 2013) Please check out the website and get your tickets early. Thanks for reading my review - Joe G.

40,Nice Midsize Venue,"I was at a show here this summer and found out Teragram just had their first anniversary of being open. At this point, I've been to five or six shows here and I've noticed that the kind of bands I'm into tend to play here (indie rock). Teragram is about the size of the Echo, if you've been there.The venue has a nice layout, with a bar and the merch area as soon as you walk in. Then you enter on either side to get to the stage and a second bar. The drink prices are very reasonable and the floor space makes it easy to see the performers, not matter where you're standing. I don't know anything about sound quality, but I've had a blast at every show I've been to here.The only bad thing is the (insert profanity here) parking. I know ""that's LA!"" but seriously, there is zero street parking in this area at night- even on a weekday. There's a ten dollar lot right across from the venue, cash only. I urge you to either uber or take the red line to the 7th/Metro Center stop and stroll over.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/52sandyw
