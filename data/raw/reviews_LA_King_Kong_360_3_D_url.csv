50,A 3D Blast!,Going on this 3D ride far exceeded our expectations of fun. It was a 3D BLAST! You're literally surrounded by action all around you during this ride. As the tour bus shakes with Kong fighting outside it really feels real.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/0221Serendipity
50,BATTLE FOR LIFE,Didn't know what to expect as we drove into Peter Jackson's Skull Island themed cave. The 3D quality kept you looking all around you for what was going to attack next!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andrewbmusic

50,Amazing experience,The King Kong 360 3-D is an amazing experience and i strongly recommend it. We saw the King Kong fighting with the dinosaurs like we were inside the movie.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AntoNic7
50,This was SOOOOO COOL!!,"The 4D thing is not my favorite, however these are don so perfectly that if you let yourself be drawn in, you will love it!It is cool to see the work of Peter Jackson, and Universal on display!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AndyB336
30,To many 3D and 4d screens that seems to be what they rely on now for rides.,Was a cool ride. I'm not a huge fan of the 3D/4d experience don't like simulators and such due to motion sickness. This is mainly how rides are done now it seems. Wouldn't do it again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NicoleC532
