50,A most interesting place to see for the whole family,"The Los Angeles County Fire Dept. Museum is a great place to visit for anyone, not just ""fire buffs"". It gives an excellent history of the Department and the apparatus display is second to none. The museum houses the famous ""Squad 51"" apparatus from the TV show ""Emergency. It is a particularly good place to visit with children. There is a small play area and a model and toy fire apparatus display. The docents are well-informed and friendly.",Bruce J
