50,Located in the elegant Garnier Building,The fine Garnier building dating from 1890 hosts this interesting museum. It presents a permanent exhibition on the origins and history of Chinese immigration to LA and temporary works showcasing modern talents.One of the latter is Heaven by Nick Dong. An inventive installation that is experienced by sitting on the centre seat and appreciating the glass and lighting effects.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/permia
50,very unique temporary exhibition with a mirror lined dodecagonal room,"permanent exhibition is fairly brief with mentions of significant historical events since the first Chinese arrived in Los Angeles area. Mostly text panels and pictures with some artefacts and one model of a herbalist shop. plan on half hour to see these.As of Sept 2019 their temporary exhibition include a mirror lined room which, using actuators, transforms between 12 sided walls and 24 sided walls, with changeable lighting and sound effects.

40,Reflects the growth and development of Chinese immigrants,"Yet another landmark of El Pueblo de Los Angeles Historical Monument, the Chinese American Museum is located in Garnier Building, the oldest and last surviving structure of Los Angeles’ original Chinatown.Originally allotted 2500 square feet, the museum area has since been increased to 7,200 square feet in 1995. Starting 1933, a large part of Chinatown was demolished to make way for the construction of Union Station – Garnier Building was one of the few that luckily survived.The Garnier Building was built in 1890 by Philippe Garnier, a French immigrant and prominent businessman. Designed primarily for Chinese commercial tenants, he leased the building to Chinese American merchants who occupied it for several decades. The rent for the whole building was $200 for the first three years!In its heyday between 1890 through 1940, Garnier Building was the unofficial city hall of the Chinese community housing temples, churches, shops, businesses and also serving as the venue for social functions, theatrical and dance performances.It is the oldest building in LA that was continuously occupied by Chinese immigrants from the time it was constructed in 1890 until the State of California took it over in 1953.With commercial tenants on the ground and mezzanine floor, the upper level was occupied by Chinatown’s leading social organizations, schools and religious institutions.These community and social institutions housed in Garnier Building, served as a bridge between Chinese and American society – they played a critical role in the backdrop of the strong American prejudices against the Chinese in Southern California, especially following the Chinese Massacre of 1871 (please see photograph of the sidewalk plaque attached to this review) and the Chinese Exclusion Acts of 1882-1943 (please see photograph of display panel attached to this review).Chinese American families and businesses have donated their heirloom possessions to the museum – traditional attire, antique furniture, faded photographs, old letters, audiotapes from elderly Chinese Americans on their memories of growing up in Old Chinatown, children’s toys.The permanent exhibitions at the museum are:• Origins: The Birth & Rise of Chinese American Communities in Los Angeles• Journeys: the story of Chinese immigration to the US with an emphasis on the community settling in Los Angeles• Sun Wing Wo General Store and Herb Shop: recreation of an actual store that was housed in Garner Building between 1891 and 1948.The museum reflects the growth and development of Chinese immigrants over the last 150 years when the first major Chinese settlement in LA was documented. It showcases the contribution of Chinese Americans and the Chinese American experience.The museum functions as a resource center dedicated to researching, preserving and sharing the experiences and stories of Chinese Americans in the US. It also does workshops, exhibitions, events and brings out publications to foster better mutual understanding and cultural appreciation between the Chinese and the Americans.Its prime location within the El Pueblo Monument sets it against the larger immigrant experience as part of a multi-cultural mosaic of people from other lands who have contributed to the development of LA and Southern California.The museum is open Tuesday – Sunday 10am to 3pm. It is closed on Mondays.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TMenon
40,Interesting and informative,"Great little free museum filled with parts of a former Chinese drugstore and displays of Chinese culture in America. Interesting information on how Chinese immigrants were treated in the U.S.A. and their struggle to be treated as citizens with civil rights. It was pretty clear that the more things change, the more they remain the same. Many comparisons could be drawn between how the Chinese were treated in the early 1900's to how we treat immigrants today.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joan632015
40,Museum,Its a small museum with lots of interesting displays. Its a great way to look back on the contributions of the chinese immigrants . Lovely way to spend an hour or so.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/140vickid
40,Small free museum,"Located near Chinatown, this small museum offers several displays of the history related to Chinese Americans in US and LA.Given the museum has free admission, I think it offers a good overview for locals and tourists. Worth visiting if one is in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Blues_3000
40,CHINESE-AMERICAN MUSEUM,"Took my son to the Chinese American Museum. Nice little place, very enlightening as to the Chinese experience in Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/groverm146
40,Very nice small Museum,"We recently made a day of seeing a handful of the small museums in this area and the Chinese American Museum was definitely one of the nicer ones. It is a very small museum and I think could be cooler. The storytelling of the museum could be a bit more narrative and there could be more things for kids to do. The highlight for sure was the Herb Shop room! That was super cool and had things that kids could pull out and look at. The woman who worked there was very nice and informative.While I wouldn't make a day trip to the area just for this museum, this area is CERTAINLY worth a day trip! My toddler and I literally visited 6 museums! There are small museums all around here and almost all of them are free! Start your journey with a walk down Olvera Street! Catch the Avila Adobe, maybe have lunch or a snack. Then walk across the way and visit The Chinese American Museum, the Plaza Firehouse Museum and the new Gateway to Nature (which is a nature center full of things for kids to do). Then walk across the street to La Plaza De Culturas y Artes museum. Maybe poke your head into Our Lady of Angeles Church. I'm very Atheist, but this is historic as it's literally what named and started Los Angeles. Then continue down Main street and hit up the American Tropical Historical Museum and end with the Italian American Museum! There are a few other things in there too I think I missed. A great day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bostonsavatage
40,Worth a visit,"Interesting ongoing timeline exhibition ""Journeys"" about the Chinese migration to California, federal laws and other challenges. Fascinating Chinese Caribbean exhibition on the 2nd floor with videos. Didn't have time to visit the Birth and Rise of Chinese American Communities in LA. Very informative receptionist. Free admission - donations box. A bit confusing to find the entrance to the compound of buildings where the museum is located.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeborahandAndy
50,Cultural Link to the Past in the Heart of El Pueblo de Los Angeles,"After our lunch in Olvera Street, we were surprised to find this museum of Chinese American History in the center of El Pueblo de Los Angeles. Located in the red brick Garnier Building (the last surviving structure in LA's Chinatown), you are instantly transported to the 1890's. On-going exhibits include the Sun Wing Wo General Store and Herb Shop which is a recreation of an actual store. Other special collections and displays are changing. Check their website for more info. Hours are limited to 10:00 AM to 3:00 PM Tuesday-Sunday. Admission is free but donations are welcomed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/socaltravelers2016
50,Fascinating Museum,"I found this place while visiting El Pueblo at Olvera St. I found it fascinating. It is a well thought out and very engaging museum. It is small so it won't take a long time, and it is worth the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bkute65
40,"Weird Hours, Great FREE Museum","Really well thought out museum with well-curated exhibits - it's also FREE, which is a huge plus. Temporary exhibit is on Asian-American Political Activism and it was super interesting to delve into that topic. One star off for the hours - 10:00AM to 3:00PM is a really weird schedule - and for the lack of a museum cafe area WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN AMAZING.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jsleos
40,Excellent Museum With Lots of History,"December 31, 2016 - While visiting our Los Angeles friend, we stopped in several museums in El Pueblo de Los Angeles historical monument area. One of the museums we visited was the Chinese American Museum, free entrance but donations if you can.The museum is located in a historic building dating from 1890, the last surviving structure from Los Angeles' original Chinatown. We enjoyed the special exhibits, paintings, and history that was expertly displayed and organized.While you are in the El Pueblo de Los Angeles historical monument area of Los Angeles, I highly recommend that you visit the Chinese American Museum, perhaps, if you can, before visiting Chinatown.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JerryH9905
40,Very interesting,"As Brits we don't have much knowledge of American culture let alone Chinese American integration.Very interesting, great artefacts and free to visit. It's also right by Alameda Street where the first inhabitants settled",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/russellm691
40,Informative,"The Admission: FREE!! They do take donations. Their staff is very knowledgeable about the history.The Museum: 3 levels of museum. Lots of information and display. Very educational and informative about how Asian came to America.The museum is very close to Olvera Street. If you are the neighborhood shopping or dining, definitely come and check out this museum. It doesn't cost you anything but you for sure learn something new.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ILoveFoodComa
40,Going to Chinatown? Go here first!,"To understand L.A.'s Chinatown, you need to first visit this small museum to learn a bit of the history of the Chinese in California.Why does the current Chinatown look so much like a movie set?Why is this museum located next to Olvera Street (El Pueblo de Los Angeles and not in Chinatown?)You will get the answers here...and a lot moreThe museum is small but full of great info and displays. There is a nice re-creation of a general store that was originally housed in the building, Sun Wing Wo General store and Herb Shop. It is a neat hands-on type of exhibit that is kid-friendly tooThe museum if free, with a suggested donation of $3.00Open Tuesday-Sunday,10-3:00It takes about an hour to go through the museum. Just a suggested itinerary: do a ""world tour"" of LA...Visit Olvera street/El Pueblo area in the morning, have some pastries, go to the Chinese American Museum, head over to Chinatown for some exploring and lunch, then go to Little Tokyo for the Japanese American Museum, more exploring and then try one of the authentic ramen shops for dinner",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travellinjenna
30,An Interesting Stop for a brief history of Chinese Immigration into America,"Stumbled across this museum in the most random of spots after visiting LA for the week. But glad we did. The museum is unassuming from the outside, but is located where the old Chinatown used to exist. Apparently it's been moved three times over the years to it's current location just north of downtown. The museum reinforced how difficult of a life it was for those Chinese immigrants who made the long arduous boat ride to America in search for opportunity and a better life. It made me thankful for the life I have now (growing up in Canada) and made me feel appreciation and pride for my ancestors who had to go through hardships, discrimination, racism, exclusion, and separation from loved ones. I would recommend a visit to this museum if nothing else, to get a rare glimpse into the history and past of the Chinese people in California, if not America.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/honeydrop
50,Small but way cool,"Small but way coolOne of my favorites cause of the history and story legal of oppressionFree with a suggested donationCan do it in 30 min or lessNext to Olvera street, nearby Union Station and it's only a short walk to China TownThis is actually near the location of the original China town in LA.Decisions to make- 2 minute walk for taquitos or 7 minute walk for chinese foodI really liked this museum as it told the struggle of Chinese immigrantsGold rush & railroads and agriculture & architecture, LA culture and societyI really liked this museum as it told the story of racism and ignorance against Chinese in California. Laws discriminating were not that long ago.We need to remember!Doesn't take long as it's so good to blend fun with education.Come to this museum-learn our Los Angeles history!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Summerasalifestyle
50,Where it all began...,"Surrounded by many popular landmarks such as the old Pico House and Olvera Street, the Chinese American Museum earns it's place among the prominent. Housed in the old Garnier Building of 1890, it represents the oldest Chinese building in SoCal. The location is perfect, as it houses many memories of the Chinatown of yesteryear and today.No admission fee, but donations are graciously accepted. As you walk on the creeky floors of this historic building, the contributions of the founding fathers come alive in the artifacts, the wall pictorials, and the sounds of old Chinatown. Today, Chinatown has grown to encompass much of the San Gabriel Valley, but it's here, where it all began.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shimadog
50,"Gem of a museum, intimate, manageable scale, but worthwhile","Contains exhibits and video testimonials and snippets documenting Los Angeles Chinese community history over two centuries. People stories, vignettes of buildings and communities, businesses and anchors. The power of still photography, mounted on the wall, with descriptions to educate and communicate the diaspora of China that the entire globe has seen",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BZT
40,Time well spent,I was visiting this place while killing time waiting for my Amtrak bus at nearby Union Station. I was pleasantly surprised- it has a small and yet interesting exhibition on the history of Chinese-Americans from both the national and local perspectives. It was time well spent. Admission is technically free but a donation (sliding scale) is suggested. It also allows visitors access to slightly cleaner restroom facilities compared to the crowded Union Station.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LouC151
50,Chinese American Museum - L.A. California,This museum was laid out for an easy walk through with lots of displays and interesting stories. There was information that tore at the heart strings as to what the Chinese went through in L.A. and the United States. Such a shame that all the buildings were tore down to make way for the Union Station. Lots of history here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Arlenegay
40,The Chinese Were Here Too,"The average tourist might be surprised to find a Chinese American museum a few steps from the Plaza adjacent to Olvera Street, a recreation of a Mexican Bizaar. Before Olvera Street was carved out of a neglected street near down town, China Town occupied much of the site and the land to the east which is now under Union Station. All this was demolished and a new China Town was built a few blocks north. The building that houses the Chines American Museum was once Los Angles' City Hall.The museum is not large but occupies 2 stories with exhibits on Chines immigration and how they spent their lives in Los Angeles. Most of the artifacts are upstairs. There is a recreation of a shop downstairs. Plan for a half hour to an hour, more if you are really interested.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KennethL828
50,Learn the Story of Chinese in L.A.,"Located adjacent to Olviera Street and close to Chinatown and Japantown, the museum is in one of the oldest parts of Los Angeles. It is a small museum with displays which tell the story of the Chinese experience in L.A. and the United States. It is story that is overlooked by many history courses and will open your eyes to the blatant racism of the late 1800's to the 20th Century.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/King_Bob_Rules
30,Nice small museum with a quick intro of Chinese Ameican History! Its Free!,"They take donations but it is free admission. This small place offers a little of everything. You learn about the immigration not only to the USA but to LA area. You learned a little about the move to Monterrey Park from Union Station area.You see a little art, some children paintings. You see some interesting pictures. The place is 2 1/2 Floors. This place is a little more upbeat and positive than the Japanese American Museum. The only complaint I have is that the area is busy and thus parking is a challenge. I would recommend it if you are in the area. This is a part of China town. One Hour is all the time you really need. They are also looking for volunteers and donors. I learned a little despite being to China over 10 ten times and 20 different cities. Taiwan was also mentioned in a few displays as well as Nixon. Several displays did keep talking about how Chinese immigrants were displaced by LA Area business and government to build Union station complex.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jdreynoldsjr
