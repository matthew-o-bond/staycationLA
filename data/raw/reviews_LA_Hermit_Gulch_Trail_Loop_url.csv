50,Views views views!,"The single track out of the campground leads you through the gulch to beautiful views of Avalon. The day we went was in the mid 70s, but felt hot on the trail. Treat it like a hike, bring water, etc.If you feel like a challenge, when you get to the top, turn right on the road. Just around the bend, turn onto Lone Tree Road. This leads you over some STEEP rollers to an incredible viewpoint. The other side of the island is pristine, no development in sight.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/moniques443
50,Great to be back~,It was the perfect day for the hike. It took me 30 minutes to get to the trailhead by foot from the Hotel Atwater. Then 40 minutes up. This is a great workout with views views views!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ccook2222
50,What a hike!!!,This challenging hike is worth every uphill step to the top for beautiful views of both sides of the island.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/manasquanboe
50,Beautiful Tranquility,"Truly one of the most beautiful and tranquil places with majestic nature and city view photo opportunities. Watch your step; it is nature, and, be respectful of the landscape. March is a not very crowded and thus a good time to enjoy the island and town without the crowds. I highly recommend it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chesterb187
50,Delightful Hike,"We hiked from the Botanic Garden to the top, and then down this gulch loop back to Avalon. Very pleasant time. Going up was a jeep trail, but the way down was a footpath. It took about three hours. Not difficult, but wear good footwear.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnsN9885KF
50,Wonderful views,"This is a rigerous hike, so remember to take water and wear a hat and sunglasses. Don't forget sunscreen because it can get hot. Views are great.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Goodness4you
50,"Enjoyable, challenging family hike","My family enjoys hiking and does it often. Our kids are 12 & 14. Don’t underestimate the difficulty of this hike - the 2 miles up does not have any breaks, downhills or flat parts. It’s beautiful, though! The views are stunning, and you feel like you are a million miles away.Dress for a hike - wear hiking boots and take plenty of water. The 2 miles down the far side of the loop is a pleasant walk- no slipping or sliding. I definitely recommend this hike, but go prepared.We met a very fit couple at the top who had come off a cruise boat without water or hiking gear and was definitely feeling it. Luckily we had some extra to share, but you won’t enjoy this hike without water, snacks and sunscreen because there is virtually no shade.Final note: we did not see any buffalo on this hike - apparently this isn’t the part of the island they prefer to hang out on, so you probably won’t, either.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stephaniecL5392VH
50,Wonderful views,"This trail had views the entire walk. The first part is all switchbacks, but take your time and pause to look around. Once you reach the summit, you’ll have near 180 degree views. Well worth the small amount of effort. I definitely recommend this one.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/justalegalgypsy
40,Enjoyed the walk to Observatory,"Walk for two 50 somethings and on 20 something was pleasant. My wife had to stop a couple of time on the steepest parts, but you may want to do that to soak in the views. Take some water for the walk up. There are fountains at the top to refill your bottles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/porter_osborne
50,Rewarding hick,"Spent Christmas Eve with my husband and 2 teens hiking the Hermit Gulch Trail. It was very nice, beautiful views, although 3 days latter our legs and butts are still sore. It took us a little over 2 hours to do the 4 miles loop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FlamencaCalifornia
20,Tough and Scary Trail section,This was part of the old Eco Marathon finish. It is shale covered single track trail that is very windy and steep. I would only recommend this for expert hikers in very good shape. There are a number of other trails that are easier to hike and that have great views.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/runningandmusing
50,Terrific butt-kick hike.... Skip the fee,"Got off the ferry, downed a breakfast burrito at Eric's then headed to the conservancy office to register and get a map and advice. After about a mile you reach the gate of the Wrigley Botanical Garden. There is an entrance fee of about $5 per person to enter the trailhead. We asked the attendant at the gate if there was a way to do the hike without the fee. ""Sure"", she said. ""Just do it in reverse."" So we walked back down about 100 yards to the west end of the campground where the exit trailhead was and hiked the loop counter-clockwise. Exited thru an ""Exit Gate"" next to the fee station 5 miles and 3 hours later. Perfectly legit (yeah, call me cheap). Actually, I think it was easier to do it this way. You hike up a real trail to the summit. On the way down how descend a road. Take plenty of water!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HammockSwinger
30,"Steep and long incline, but pretty nice view","Admittedly I didn't make it all the way around the loop, but there's a pretty long and steady incline which might wear some people out. The view is pretty nice; otherwise the trail is not overly exciting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rrosendahl
30,"Ocean desert trail, much effort, little reward.","Had hoped to see interesting local wildlife and vegetation. Turns out this Is more like a desert hike. The views of Avalon and Overtown (on a clear day) are interesting, but the angle of view remains unaltered all trail long. Didn't do the full loop, just the Hermit Gulch Trail out an back. Took about two hours from Campground and return. Wished I would have worn my hiking boots, because it's real steep and slipery. Not really worth the effort if you are only on a day trip to Avalon, like I was.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/010bertv
50,"Beautiful views, moderate hike, 2.5 hrs round trip","We started our trek from the harbor and walked about 1.5 miles to the campground at the foothills of the Wrigley Botanical Garden. There is a moderate fee to enter of $8 per person which goes to the Catalina Island Conservancy. The entire walk is slightly uphill starting at the harbor just about.We walked up to the Wrigley Memorial for some spectacular harbor views. Once you take in the views, you walk down the memorial to a gate on the north side just about 50 yards from the steps. Once you open the gate you are at the trailhead of the “Garden to Sky Trail”. From this point the entire loop is supposed to be 3.8 miles and gains 2,326ft.The Garden to Sky Trail will dead end into Divide Road (which is essentially a forest service road). Divide Road continues to climb the entire way, until you reach Hermit Gulch Trail. Once you turn right into this trail you are going downhill on a “single track” trail. The sights all around are spectacular.By my estimate the entire trip was about 6.8 miles. It took about 2.5 hrs round trip.Hints: (1) dress in layers as you will work-up a sweat going up and it’s cool at the top during the fall, winter, and spring seasons. (2) bring sunscreen and sunglasses. (3) bring good hiking shoes or sneakers, and (4) don’t forget water.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/agg2011
50,Awesome hike,This is an amazing hike. Be prepared to climb. The views are amazing. Take lots of water as there is not much shade and it gets a bit hot. Totally worth the trek up.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nellykelly518
40,A generous hike for those inclined,"A decent enough hike, about 4 hours round trip if you stop at the nature conservancy building on the way down. We called into the tourist office for a map and they sent us down the road to the Catalina Island Conservancy office who gave us a map from Bill's Bikes and drew the trail on it. Come on, there are only a handful of trails and the island doesn't even have a decent map for them. Start the trail at the end of the campsite and do a loop that ends at the Wrigley memorial. You will be hiking uphill for a fair stretch, but the views are fantastic. No toilets or water on the trail.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/frugalshopper
50,It is mpossible to waste your time on this hike,"I have taken this trail with companions in winter, spring, and fall, and I firmly believe it is impossible to waste your time on this hike. There is always so much to entertain the senses, whether it is sunny and clear or overcast and drizzly. Catalina weather is, fortunately, sunny and clear more often than not, and the views from the ridge, in all directions, are something that a camera cannot do full justice to. It's a Grand Canyon sort of problem -- there is no substitute for experiencing it first-hand. You can enhance this experience further by bringing along a paper or electronic guide to Catalina flora and fauna, some of which is found nowhere else on earth. Also: bring along snacks, plenty of water, and sunscreen; a hat is also strongly recommended, as well as at least a light jacket or sweater as, depending on the wind, it can sometimes be much cooler on the ridge than it is on the way up or down.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/williamm690
50,Great hike with beautiful views!,"This was a wonderful hike with gorgeous views. We didn't see any fox, but the hike was challenging and worth every effort.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pameladC9019ZJ
40,Strenuous hike with incredible views,"Before you go, decide how to get to the trailhead: walk from Avalon, or catch the public bus system. The walk will add about 1.5 miles each way, but it's what we did. We chose to go counter clockwise, starting at the trail head in the campground. Watch closely for the Hermit Gulch Trail sign, which is just past some of the campground bathrooms.We found the uphill part of the hike to be fairly strenuous. Take your time, take plenty of water, and stop at some of the switch backs to enjoy the view. Once at the top, you can reverse direction, or take the road to the LEFT to eventually connect with the Garden to Sky road that runs right down to the botannica gardens. Total time out on the hike was about 3 hours. Note: good shoes are a must to avoid sliding on the graveled paths. The start of the hike has some rock steps- make sure all parties in your group can step up at least 12-18 inches. Hiking sticks would be helpful. Dress in layers- you really work up a sweat on the uphill part, and it gets warm! Go online before you go to apply for your hike permit through the Catalina Island Conservancy website. And, based on our experience, prepare for some sore calves the next day. :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JennyW337
50,"A pretty tough uphill hike, but oh what scenery!","Almost certainly the best-kept secret among local off-road hikers. It starts at the back of the campground and meanders uphill for 2+ miles. The trail has been widened in recent years but remains fairly uneven; thus, don't be a knucklehead and wear decent shoes or boots. At the top is a gorgeous lookout that stretches across both sides of the island, and there is a wider and easier road down if you don't want to retrace your steps. Go early or late and you're likely to see wildlife too. All in all, highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Poochkin
50,Beautiful hike.,Like people suggested we started from Hermit Gulch trailhead. The hardest part was finding out the best way to get there. We discovered a bus that has various stopping point around Avalon and for $1 we got a ride. This is a pretty nice and robust hike but beautiful. I took 750 liter of water which could have used a little more. We loved the views and vistas and enjoyed being outdoors without spending money for pricey tours. The whole hike was 5 mikes but we walked about 1mile beyond the Botanical gardens. Highly recommend this hike and dress in layers. The wind was cool but the inclines made it hot!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/580courtney
50,Amazing Views of Both Sides of Catalina,"This hike provides great views of the island, channel, mainland and the Pacific. The day we were there it was so clear that we could easily see snow on the top on Mount Baldy back on the Mainland. To do the loop, you have to go through the Wrigley Gardens. If you follow most directions, they have you go up the canyon, through the Gardens and around to Herman Gulch Trail. If you do that, the Gardens charge you $8 a person. However, if you go up the canyon, but turn right at the Hermit Gulch Trail before you get to the Gardens, you can make the look and come in through the back of the Gardens at no charge. Basically, you're going in the reverse of what most guides tell you. One word of caution, taking that reverse route puts you climbing uphill on Hermit Gulch Trail and it can be a little steep, but very manageable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ohtobeinsandiego
40,Prvides a great overview of the island,"We started at the Wrigley memorial, took the road section up and then the trail back down to the campground. It can get warm and make sure you have plenty of water.A great view on top of the ridge for the Pacific side of the island.Register for your hike down at the Conservancy offie and pick up a map.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Brando62
50,8-mile round trip hike,My wife and I walked from our hotel on the seafront to the Hermit Gulch Trail. At the top we turned right onto Divide Road and then right again down Stagecoach Road. We went in January and the weather was excellent - not too hot or cold. We had good shoes but did not need walking boots. Although the trail is steep it was OK for us - we're both 69.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mjh672016
40,Not a bad hike or too strenuous,"We took the bus and got off at the campground and started from here instead of the botanical garden. (Note: if you start this way you don't have to pay to go through botanical garden, but you do exit through it. You have to be a really big botanical buff to like this garden as it was more cactus and green plants vs. beautiful flowers so for us we didn't really enjoy it.) But starting this way also was harder than going the other way as I felt the elevation and the trail were harder to go up instead of going down so I was happy to choose this route. Some people told us this was a 6 mile trail but according to my fitness app it said it was approximately 5 miles. Once we got to the top there is a little pavilion and from there on down it seemed like we were hiking a road so it didn't feel as adventurous on the way down. I liked hiking up as you could see and hear possible wild animals scurrying away from us and feel more like in nature with a beautiful view. Also, temperatures might be cool in town but they definitely rise an extra ten degrees as you hike up so wear layers. From this hike you can see a lot of other trails around that I'd definitely like to experience. Try this hike for a nice morning hike or go on a longer one if you can endure. But degree of difficulty is easy to medium.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spicytravelasian
50,Views forever,"It was recommended to us to take the loop from the memorial garden to the top and then back down the trail to the campground, and we are glad we did. This route was much more forgiving than if we had gone the opposite direction which is much rougher terrain and much steeper going up. Also, the views are quite nice coming down the steep terrain and we would have missed a lot of that had we gone up the steep terrain instead. There is a view point at the top with a partial shelter for a little shade and resting point. There are very few trees and depending on the time of day that you go limited shade depending on where the sun is at the time. Bring plenty of water as there are no services, no fountains, etc. The views along the way are spectacular. Be sure to wear good shoes, hiking boots would be better for the more narrow, rugged, rocky trail portion.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janad63
50,Start Early to beat the heat,"We planned well ahead to get to Avalon to take the trail before the sun rose and it was worth every minute. It was lovely to walk in the clouds. Once the clouds settled, you have beautiful views of Avalon and the ocean.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nass673
50,Great morning hike,Great 3 hr morning hike on this trail. Really nice views at the top of the harbor and the hills. Also a nice spot at the top for eating some lunch in the shade (although there were lots of bees).Trails are nicely maintained and decent enough signs,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sjdance02
50,Go this way and save $,"We went to the nature center which is on the way to get our permit (which is required but free, suggested donation $3/person) and the man at the desk was super helpful. The trail starts at the far end of the campground and climbs steadily. It has rocks and gullies which requires hikers with sure footing. I really like this part of the trail as it was narrow vs the adjoining Transcatalina and Memorial road which were very wide and groomed trails. There are great views along the way as well as beautiful flora. You could do the loop from Wrigley Memorial & Botanical Garden but then you would have to pay $7/person to enter the garden. Since Hermit Gulch trail is a more rugged and narrow trail with loose rock, going up it was a better choice. .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KarenEph320
50,Great views!,"We did the Garden-to-Sky trail to the Hermit Gulch loop. The trail wasn't difficult and the views at the top were amazing! The Hermit Gulch portion (our descent) had been eroded in parts by recent rainfall, so it would have been more difficult in the opposite direction.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KenCC
50,Nice short hike on the backside of Catalina,"Started at the Hermit Gulch campground and finished at the Wrigley Memorial. Steep climb for about 45 minutes, then leisurely stroll back down. 5 miles, ~2 hours with lots of ops photo stops.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/282jeanyvesc
50,Amazing,"Amazing views of valley and the marina; moderate difficulty of hiking. Public bus from town ($1 one way fare) takes you to Camping Ground trailhead and back; however, we chose to walk instead of taking the bus.

50,Breathtaking,"This is a hard walk so if you are not in shape take it slow I am 58 and walk 6 miles a day flat, I made it but legs were shaky coming down, so take your time. tI was breathtaking when we got to the top worth the hike.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoyP285

40,Nice 4 mile loop,"Nice hike with great views of both sides of the island when you reach the 'Garden to Sky' summit. The Hermit Gulch Trail section is an actual trail but once you reach the HGT summit you hike on a wide dirt road for the remaining part of the loop...which takes you down to the Garden to Sky Summit and eventually the Wrigley Memorial. TIPS: bring ample water, shoes with good traction (hiking boots not necessary), and binoculars for bird watching. You will likely encounter local deer and sometimes foxes who are not timid of humans. Remember these are still wild animals who can get spooked and hurt you so use good judgment and keep a safe distance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SoCalAdventureSeeker
40,"Quick, easy hike","I picked up my hiking permit from the conservancy and then walked up to the campsite from Avalon, took me about 20-25 mins at a meandering pace, I was in no rush. The campsite is obvious to spot and the trail head is signposted. However, there's no signpost to say you've reached the ""top"" of the trail and you can just continue on up I believe the lone pine trail (something like that!-not signposted!) or carry on over to do the loop into the gardens (which you have to pay to enter) or just turn back around and go down.It took me about 30 mins to hike up to the look out point at a steady pace and then I continued another 10-15 to the next lookout point (view wasn't too different!) just less trail traffic and sat there and had lunch. Nice spot to escape the crowds of Catalina!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stinax
50,"Great 4 Mile Loop - Views, Wrigley Memorial and Botanical Gardens","Started by picking up a trail map and a hiking permit at the Catalina Island Conservancy Nature Centre on Avalon Canyon Road. Trailhead is less than 1/4 mile up the road at the campsite. The Hermit Gulch Trail is primarily a single track trail and is fairly steep in some sections. Great views all along the way. At the trails end, we went left down Trans Catalina Trail to the Garden in Sky Trail (gravel roads) which took us down to the Botanical Gardens and Wrigley Memorial. Worth the sweat!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Waltonx4
50,Short But Mighty,"Just a mere 1.7 mile trail. However a good portion is steep. Not only steep but the gravel will slip and slide beneath your shoes. Do wear a good pair of sturdy hiking boots if you are carrying a pack. Sneakers with good ankle support and grip are a must. This trail takes you to a scenic overlook worth the struggle. The trail takes me 40 minutes up but I don't stop. Most people will want to take a break in the heat. Bring plenty of water. Once at the top of the trail you are now on The Trans Catalina Trail. If you face the road and turn left head .8 miles to Garden to Sky trail. That trail will take you 1.2 miles and end up in the Botanical Gardens. If you turn right you can go to Lone Tree Trail. That trail is 1 mile each way, out and back, to a scenic vista. It is also very steep in places.In the late afternoon look for a Grey Fox at the Hermit Gulch trail end.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BluewaterGypsy
50,"Terrific hike, high above Avalon!","With a route that goes up and over Avalon to Pebbly Beach, this is a great trail to get your steps in while taking in gorgeous views of the bay(s), the Pacific Ocean, and (on a clear day) the California mainland.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/652rayq
50,Great hike!,"This is possibly the 4 th time I have done this hike, it's still my favorite in Avalon. Right past the campground is the trailhead. You must first go to the Catalina Island Conservancy and fill out a free, on line permit. I walked to the trail head from town, took about 15 minutes. The hike is great, I would rate parts of it moderate, many parts are very easy. Some of the hike is on wide, fire road, some of it is more narrow. I recommend hiking boots. Could be done with sneakers. We had a visit from a Catalina fox, who hung out with us for about 15 minutes, while on the trail. Please do not feed these animals. Closer to the ridge, we were enveloped in a dense fog/ mist- it was wonderful to have a very strong breeze as today it was very warm. Usually at the top, you can see the ocean from the other side, today we couldn't due to the fog. Hiking back down, we came through the gate of the Wrigley Botanical Garden, you will walk through the Garden to get back out to the main road. Some very unusual plants/ trees- very interesting to me the specimans from Madagascar. There is an interpretive area in the Garden with interesting info regarding Catalina history, indigenous people who used to live on the island.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/keywestelaine

40,Steep and worth the views,"Started from the Wrigley Memorial up the Garden to Sky trail to meet the Divide Road before meeting the Hermit Gulch cutoff. Leisurely took 2.5 hours to complete this loop, but saw several endemic plants, birds, lizards, and a fox lounging by the shaded rest area at the top of the gulch. Descending could have been more well marked, but overall the trail is well maintained and no worries of getting lost on the way to the campground.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fredrickj540
50,Earn you rest!,"We did this hike with our 11 and 8-year-old boys. Although they were not accustomed to hiking, they completed the ""hike to the sky"" a great morale boost, giving them a wonderful feeling of accomplishment. Every time we would come around the bend, they would be surprised that it was still so much further to go. They earned their rest each time we reached a beautiful view of the ocean below.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GiaPazita
40,Good workout at the island!!,"We started at 1 PM from the trail head at campsite, climbing up is a bit challenging but not too bad, the elevation gain is about 1500 ft in 2 miles. The view and sea breeze at the top are great. Bring enough water in a warm day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/moonriseny
50,"Great views, mostly an actual dirt road, keep your eyes open for endemic plants!",I lived at the trailhead for this trail for 7 years. This is a great trail to head up to access other more remote areas of the island and get some peace and quiet. There are great views of the water. It is steep in some sections and there is no water along the trail. Plan accordingly. I have rescued several folks who broke ankles and sprains along the way so take your time. Watch out for the occasional crazy mountain biker bombing down the narrow trail.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/626janelh
50,Well worth the view!,"Start from the camp site. There is a steady climb up a dirt path which rewards you with several views of Avalon. At the top there is an area shaded at you can admire your hard climb. Take a left and head down the fire trail, and then the best view is yet to come. You are along the ridge and straddle both sides of the island. It is spectacular. Head dow, stop by the Wrigley Memorial and botanical garden, then call a cab and hang out downtown. This is the perfect hike and takes ~2 hours. Well worth it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sondraw221

It is a bit of a hike as you climb about 1700ft in about 2 miles. but if you are up for a little work the views are amazing, I think I may have worn out my camera taking photos. We would do this hike again but only in cool weather. During a hot day this would be pretty rough, take water either way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cameron351
40,"Hard, but rewarding hike","This hike starts by raising in elevation more than 1,200 feet in the first mile or so. There is very little shade, but the views from the top are amazing. It was harder than I thought it would be, but we really enjoyed it anyway. Take your hike in the morning before the heat of the day. There was a lot of cactus, so make sure you stick to the trail!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/732LauraC732

50,Beautiful vistas!,"This was a great little day hike. You do need a permit, but they hand them out like candy. They just want to know who is where in case someone doesn't come back. We didn't finish the loop, but we did make it nearly to the summit. We had been exhausting ourselves the previous two days, so a two mile climb up a mountain seemed like plenty to us. We saw lots of deer and woodpeckers. There is a fantastic view of the ocean and the port. This is a great trail for someone wanting to explore the island around Avalon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adambN418LX
30,No shade and steep,"I love hiking, and I enjoyed this one. My girlfriend struggled because of how steep the trail is and how hot it was. The top was cool.

I'm not sure I stayed on this loop as advertised, but it was great. You hike up to the gardens (pay fee), and head up the mountain (1,500ft). From the top, you see the pacific on two sides, and the town on the other. We started at 8AM, and didn't see anyone till noon, when the tour-hummers started going by every hour. Only saw 4 other hikers all day!, and this was on a Sunday",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WorldTraveller550
40,Catalina Local Hike with a Great View,"My husband and I were on Catalina Island for a couple days for our mini honeymoon. One of the local staff members at our hotel suggested this for a hike because we wanted to go on a good hike with few tourists (something that locals normally go on). He was right about this hike. This was a great hike with an awesome view. However, be prepared because the majority of it is steep and uphill. We also took this hike in the heat of the day which I do not recommend, but the views made it all worth it. We even saw a cute fox at the top of the hill! It depends which route you take, but all in all our hike ended up being about 4.8 miles. I definitely recommend this hike for someone who wants to do something in Catalina Island that isn't so touristy and has great views!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/meganw97
40,You need a permit,This was not told to us. We talked to many staff and information stands and not one person told us about this. So we start heading up to the trail and couldn't find the entrance. So we walked to the botanical gardens. They said we needed a permit and looked at me like I was a dumb. Had I not asked if I could get a permit at that booth she would have probably made me walk all the way back down to the town.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tam5011
50,Gorgeous views from this trail,"So much time is spent near the beach in Catalina that people don't realize there are beautiful vistas on the hiking trails, including Hermit Gulch. Bring your camera because the views are stunning.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gabby92399
50,Time to get your exercise,"I did the 5 mile loop that started at the campground, then went up to the peak, and back around to the botanical garden. I'm glad I chose this direction. The trail going up is a bit rocky, whereas when you start your descent, it's a fire road. I was able to jog down the fire road :) I also walked from the hotel, which added almost another 4 miles. Catalina is a quite town, nice for a walk. I left around 1130am, and returned to hotel around 1:30pm. It was a cloudy day, so no sunburns.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SiobhanM779
40,Wonderful Views,"This is a really pretty hike, but it'll kick your butt if you're not really the athletic type (like it did mine). But nonetheless, the views are wonderful, and the decent was all the more pleasant and enjoyable for how steep the ascent had been. I started in the camp ground and ended in the botanical gardens, and heartily recommend that other hikers do the same.Don't forget to bring extra sunscreen and water!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Marley32253
40,"Great views, challenging hike","We started this hike at the Wrigley Memorial and hiked up to the vista and then came down the Hermit Gulch Trail that ends in the campground along the road. This is a great hike, but pretty challenging because of the elevation gain. The views and the baby fox in the den at the very top were well worth the climb. Probably one of the best things we did while at Catalina. Strongly recommended for those looking for a half day hike or some challenging exercise.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/allg00dnamesaretaken
50,Great hike and views,Highly recommend doing a loop up Hermit Gulch Trail from the campgrounds and then down the road and trail back to the Wrigley Memorial.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/swegs
50,Great half day hike!,"We spent one day on the island and this was the first thing we did upon arriving in the harbor. We took a taxi to the campground and started from there (no fee). It is unable uphill trek to get to the top so make sure to bring water and sunscreen.one at the top you go left at the road and it is an easy downhill trail from there with more of a paved path. Once you get closer to the memorial, you have a great view ahead of you and you'll finish off in the gardens, which is a wonderful way to end the hike. From there we paid $2 for the trolley to take us back into town",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/60denisen
40,A great 4 mile hike,This is a loop trail which you can begin either in the Wrigley Botanical Garden or at the Hermit Gulch campground. I highly suggest beginning at the campground. The trail immediately begins to climb and takes you in and out of shaded areas. Before long you will have spectacular views of the Avalon Harbor in the distance. After a little over 2 miles you will reach the summit. Then the trail down is more of a road which descends to the botanical garden. Beginning at the campground you also avoid paying the entrance fee to the garden ...... and get to visit it for free at the end of your hike!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GareThere
50,Great hike -spectacular views!,A 5 mile loop trail from the campground and ending at the Wrigley a Memorial. Take plenty of water and a camera!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paradequeen
40,Great View!,"We started our hike from the city center, through the botanical gardens and down toward the camp ground. It was one of our more enjoyable hikes. It's tough, but not overly difficult, but you do need to be prepared. Be sure to wear hiking appropriate shoes, carry water, and a snack. Once you get to the top you can see all of the city center and both sides of the ocean. The view is worth it! Keep in mind that in high season you will encounter rattle snakes and other critters. I also suggest that you get a hiking permit in case an act of nature happens someone will know where you're located. I also wouldn't recommend doing the entire hike alone, there are some steep areas and it's my personal belief that hiking with a buddy is best. One last note, if you finish your hike between 2 - 7 p.m. then splurge and get some $1 tacos, $2 draft beer or $5 margaritas at the Sandtrap's Happy Hour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/489amyr
40,Hot & dusty but awesome workout,We did this hike in reverse meaning we did not start behind the botanical gardens like they suggest but straight up the trailhead before you go into the gardens. This saves you the fee they charge you to get into the gardens. We started in Avalon & hiked up to the trail (1.5 miles). From this point it is 1.7 miles straight up & there is not much shade so bring water (it was very hot & sunny when we went). The view looking down towards Avalon is beautiful. At the top you will be able to see the Pacific Ocean on both sides of the island...very cool & well worth the hike.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Puravida404
40,Take a tour....,You can get a bus tour or drive your own golf cart. Fun to get a golf cart and toddle around Avalon and the areas above the town.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thomassG3669AB
50,"""Escape from Avalon!""","A strenuous hike that takes you to the top of the island, where you get sweeping views of both sides. We started at the Hermit Gulch campground trailhead, and enjoyed a picnic lunch at the gazebo at the trail's summit. The footing was a little tricky in places but we were glad that we went up this direction because it was much easier coming down on the Garden to Sky part of the loop with its broad dirt road. Be sure to stop at the Wrigley Memorial, Avalon's version of the Taj Mahal - it's spectacular!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mcmor
