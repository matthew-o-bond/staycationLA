50,Opened in 1969.,"One of the strangest sights we have recently seen, for that matter heard, were about 30 green parrots high in the Palm Trees as we walked towards the pier. Just the amount of noise these birds make is enough to turn your head and ask what is that, or what is going on. They make a beautiful fight in pairs or 5 and 6 together. As we got closer to the pier, the number of ships just outside the port is an amazing sight. Tug Boats pulling and pushing these enormous ocean going ships, some riding high in the water, some low. How does the small Tug Boat have the power? A very pleasant walk in the fresh ocean air. Unlike most other piers, this one is surrounded by condominiums and homes, parking lots, restaurants and businesses, a truly urban area. Then out over the sea...",James Weaver
40,"Jog, walk, meander, take a seat, watch the sunset, fish","There is a lot to do on the Pier. It isn't the cleanest or prettiest pier in LA County, nor does it offer a great restaurant or anything like that, but it is a decent pier with nice bench seating and, more important than anything, great views of the ocean, Catalina Island, the Port and the sunset/sunrise.Seriously, if you've never sat out on the pier and watched the sun go down behind the Palos Verdes Peninsula, you need to try it. And guess what? It's totally free, you just have to walk on it.",Kyle B
50,GREAT TO WANDER AND ENJOY OR TAKE A BREAK FROM CYCLING,I love to stop off at the pier when cycling up and down the beach highway. Lots of benches to grab a spot and take in the sunset or watch to boats going back and forth to the oil facilities.Love to go after 5:30 if we're driving to take advantage of the free parking.Overall an excellent facility to both recognize the veterans and take in the scenery.,SenorGancho
