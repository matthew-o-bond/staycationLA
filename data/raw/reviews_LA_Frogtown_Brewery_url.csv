50,Nice Respite,"I was here for the first time today, after a 3 mile trek up, down, around the L.A. River.. I passed their sign coming-going to Marsh Park!What a perfect place to quench a parched throat.I drank a pint of Wit, which was a tiny bit yeasty (sour) and a pint of Kinky Blond, which was so mellow and perfectly balanced.There are plenty of IPAs for everyone else, but the Hoppy Bitterness of IPA, isn't my thing.There is some good local art (if you care to notice) on the walls & a game/book library.The staff was friendly (except one)... Photos were taken with permissionDowners:No food, but there is a food truck outsideStools were too high for the table, need some regular chairsChildren... yep some woman had her 2-yr old thereDogs: WTH? You can't go anywhere without your dog (who is not a licensed service animal)No Parking...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Auntie-Nanuuq
50,A Local Brewery Right Next to the LA River,"Super cozy brewery right in my own neighborhood just blocks from my house, how cool to have a local brewery and with the name of the neighborhoods local gang name, lol. Seriously they're called Frog Town. So far this has been a very relaxed environment with good local beer. They hosted the world series and it was a full house. The tenders are practically here all day and know you as soon as you walk up, I guess that's what makes us regulars. The beer itself is fresh and young, but ambitious and definitely holding it's own with the likes of Golden road brewery not far away, it's still got a way to go to compete with Eaglerock Brewery, but that another story. Frog town brewery has 9 taps of their own brews. My favorite go in this order:1. Hazy River2. Man Da Rin3. Don't shoot your Eye out4. Kinky Blonde5. Dark Times6. Coconaut7. Broken Vessel8. Third Base Belgian9. Captain FoxSo far my time with them about two months, I have already switched to their brand from my usual Sculpin or Stone beer. I still have the others but I actually go fill up my growlers with them, three at a time or 64 oz times 3. Not always but hey it's worth the trip for Fresh beer.In this review there is a question asked of me, Is this place Kid friendly, Amazingly Yes! Kids and doggies are welcome with responsible adults.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hectorh865
50,Perfect Sunday afternoon with crisp brews and tasty Hawaiian food!!!,"They have a variety of brews, my favorite is the Third Base Belgian which is a rich, flavorful lager with a caramel after taste. The Place has a very cool, friendly vibe! Oh!! And on Sundays, there is an awesome food truck (Ohana Hawaiian Grindz) right outside which serves very tasty Hawaiian food which is perfect for drinking beer! We had their Aloha burger, Loco Moco, spam musubi and the best Poke Bowl ever!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z9769PCangelaa
