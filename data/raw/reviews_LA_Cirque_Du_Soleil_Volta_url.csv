30,Voila - A Unique Experience,"I love Cirque de Soleil's shows, however, in my opinion, Voila was not one of their best performance. Cirque de Soleil has definitely changed over the years. Their last two shows have not been impressive ...okay but not wonderful. If you enjoy acrobatics, then I would suggest you go to see the show. Its entertaining and a nice evening out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1californiagirl
30,The Least Impressive Show,"I go to Cirque du Soleil almost every year and have seen most of the Vegas shows. I can honestly say, I have liked almost every show. Volta is the exception. The story line is so bizarre, the music is underwhelming, and the acts are subpar compared to most shows. A roller skater is not a wow act. We have seen bike tricks elsewhere. Thank goodness for the trampoline act, which saved the show. I would skip this Volta and hope for a better show next time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travlinmom1429

20,"Ok for the first-time Cirque viewers, if purchased at a significant discount.","The most underwhelming Cirque show that I've seen (out of 5 or 6) . Their trademark imagination and the talent are not in this one. ""Volta's"" plot is about a boy struggling with his unusual hair color. Spoiler alert: he grows to accept it. As for the show, well, it is pale compared to other Cirque shows. Performers are all in good physical shape, they just don't do much. The theme of the show is ""extreme sports"" but you are likely to see more action at your local skate park or an youth gymnastics meet. I was excited to see the girl hanging from the hair, but she also just aimlessly hanged there, albeit gracefully. This act could be so much more. A couple of years ago I had a pleasure of attending a small ""hair hang"" show called ""Capilotracte√©s"", and it was so much more engaging and deep. ""Volta"" is a waste of opportunity and money. Feels like they are riding the reputation on this one. Though I think that overall people in the audience liked it. Perhaps, with its greatly discounted tickets, ""Volta"" is aiming to bring first-timers to Cirque du Soleil, and not so much to appease their regular ""spoiled"" audience. That probably worked. I hope this is not a long-term trend though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ellarain
20,"VOLTA Cirque du Soleil "" Hennessy VIP"" WASTED MONEY","Im a huge long time fan of Cirque du Soleil. I usually pay for the VIP Hennessy Experience. LA Volta Hennessy is a total Rip Off, compared to what we normally received. We were recently at Alegria in Miami, it was FANTASTIC, but in LA there was hardly any food. Waiters walk around with plates of nibblets, small portion food, everyone in the tent was grabbing & scarfing it. One block of cheese for all the people! No Buffet like in Miami, They Let us in :10 min late, and ran out of food : 15 min prior to the show starting. We had to keep asking for bread . People just left before the show started because of lack of food. TACKY. Our recent VIP in Miami, had ton of excellent food ( lobster, shrimp, many cheeses, proscutto, salami, In Los Angeles Venue was total Rip Off at $275 per Ticket we were expecting a lot more. Dont do the VIP in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/samie2222
